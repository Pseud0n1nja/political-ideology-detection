0,2,2009-01-07,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to honor a brave American  soldier who sacrificed his life for freedom, Sergeant John Penich.  Sergeant Penich, by all accounts,  was an  extraordinary  solider whose  hard work and determination earned  him the title of Soldier of the Year in  2007 for his brigade. His bravery was  evident in combat on several occasions.  Brigadier General Perry Wiggins has  said he knows of three separate  instances when Sergeant Penich saved  the lives of his comrades.  According to newspaper reports, one  of his final acts of bravery came on  September 6, 2008, when his patrol was  attacked by rocket-propelled grenades  and  small-arms  fire. He  showed his  courage under fire, taking charge and  reestablishing security and saving the  lives  of  his  platoon members. His  heroics on that day earned him a Silver  Star, the third highest honor given to  members of  the armed  services  for  valor.  Five and a half weeks after he earned  the Silver Star, he gave the ultimate  sacrifice. Sergeant Penich put himself  in harm’s way to make the world a better place.  His commitment to this country is  second to none. He wanted to be an officer, and there’s no doubt we would  have benefited from this young man’s  tremendous leadership abilities.  Sergeant  John Penich  is  a  true  American hero.  I ask that my colleagues keep his family and friends in  their thoughts and prayers during this  very difficult time.  f  CONGRESS MUST WORK TO SAVE  AND  CREATE  JOBS  DURING  THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2009
1,2,2009-01-07,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Madam  Speaker,  last  year,  nearly 2 million Americans lost their  jobs. Almost half of those job losses  came in October and November, after  the financial collapse of Wall Street.  The December jobs numbers will be  out in a couple of days, but it is not  likely to be good news. All month long  retailers were saying that they had to  lay off seasonal help because Americans simply were not spending their  money. And that’s not surprising, considering that many of our constituents  are justifiably concerned about their  job security. Even those that are confident that they will hold on to their  jobs are feeling financially squeezed because they are being paid  less than  they were 10 years ago.  As  the  111th Congress begins  this  week, we are committed  to getting  Americans  back  to work  and  preventing  further  job  cuts  from happening later this year. We also want to  provide middle class Americans with  tax relief so they can better afford  their monthly bills.  Madam Speaker, as change comes to  Washington, we should work in a bipartisan manner to pass an economic recovery package quickly. We cannot afford to wait.  f  A NEW YEAR  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, this year we should  work immediately to address the challenges facing our Nation. Recent job  losses and a decline  in the housing  market have led many Americans to  lose confidence in our economy. I am  optimistic, however, that sound bipartisan solutions that support small businesses and provide tax relief to American families will mean a quicker recovery and less of a burden on future  generations of taxpayers.  As we expand opportunities for job  creation, Congress should promote an  all-of-the-above  energy  strategy. We  cannot sustain our expensive and strategically dangerous dependence on foreign oil.  While  there  remain  enemies who  threaten our freedoms, I am grateful  that our fighting men and women remain committed  to  their duty. We  must defeat terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. We  must always honor our military and  veterans.  I am confident that we will lead our  Nation toward greater prosperity and  security if we trust and invest in the  ingenuity and spirit of the American  people with limited government.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th.  f  ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN  INVESTS IN AMERICA’S FUTURE  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
2,2,2009-01-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, at a  time of great economic anxiety, this  new Congress  faces  enormous  challenges. In the next 6 weeks we’re going  to craft and hopefully pass an economic recovery package that will create and save millions of jobs and will  help jump start our economy with investments in some of our Nation’s top  priorities.  At a time when millions of Americans are losing their health insurance,  Washington needs to provide critical  assistance to States so that they can  continue to provide health care services through Medicaid. If Congress does  not act, States will have no other  choice  than  to begin dropping coverage. That  is an  immediate health  care concern that we should deal with  as part of any economic stimulus package.  But we also have an opportunity to  modernize our health care system with  new  computer  technology  that will  greatly reduce health care costs and  will improve care for every American.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to  working with all of my colleagues in  crafting a bipartisan plan that will  help rebuild our economy so that we  can get people back to work.  f  SELF DEFENSE AGAINST  RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
3,2,2009-01-07,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  the radical hate group Hamas in Gaza  has  refused  to  renew a  truce with  Israel. It has begun once more firing  thousands of Iranian-made rockets into  Israel. Numerous Israelis have died in  the last 11 days.  Hamas wants to annihilate Israel because, well, they’re Jews. Hamas kills  people that aren’t radical Muslims like  themselves. That’s why they’re called  terrorists.  Hamas cowardly hides among civilians for cover, fires rockets, then is indignant  if  Israel defends  itself. But  Israel has moved  into Gaza to  find  these bad guys.  Some world  leaders,  rather  than  mounting pressure on Hamas to stop  the rocket attacks, are calling for a  ceasefire, even a unilateral withdrawal  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:33 Jan 08, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07JA7.003 H07JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

6,9,2009-01-07,Mr. TOWNS., I’m prepared to close.  ,2009
7,9,2009-01-07,Mr. ISSA.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume  simply to say that I look forward to  working with the chairman on any perfecting language here or in the Senate  necessary to make this an even more  acceptable bill to all Members because  I believe that, as Mr. DUNCANsaid, this  is a bill whose time has come. We have  been more than 6 years attempting to  have this happen.  I think one thing that is very clear is  that we could talk about library A, library B, library C, but as President  Bush leaves office and that library is  going to be built in Dallas, I think the  American people will want to know  every bit as much as with any previous  President that that money was given  by people who appreciated the legacy  of that President and not by people  who  appreciated  specific  actions  of  that President in real-time.  And so I join with the majority and  Mr. DUNCAN, as the original author of  some time ago, in asking for quick passage of a bill, perfected as necessary in  the work that I expect we will do together.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009
8,9,2009-01-07,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, our  President-elect has talked a lot about  transparency. He’s really interested in  transparency.  So  improving  transparency of donations to Presidential libraries, as this bill does, will assure  the American people that their Presidents are not being influenced by unknown persons or groups.  Open government  is an  important  goal of the Congress and the incoming  administration, and I hope today’s bill  is just the right kind of bill to move  forward with that in mind.  Let me say, Madam Speaker, this is a  good piece of legislation, and I’m hoping that my colleagues join me in supporting this bill. I want to thank the  PLATTS,  DUNCAN,  minority  for  their  support,  and  of  course, we will continue to look and  see how we might be able to improve  the legislation, but I really feel that  this is a giant step in the right direction. Transparency is something that  we cannot lose sight of.  ",2009
9,9,2009-01-07,Mr. WAXMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank  Representative TOWNS for bringing this bill to  the floor today. H.R. 36, the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act has a simple purpose. It requires that the organizations created  to raise money  for presidential  libraries and  their affiliated institutions disclose information  about their donors.  The lack of any such requirement creates  opportunities  for abuse. Under current  law,  anybody can give to these organizations anonymously, even while the President is still in office. These donations could be used to influence  presidential  decision-making with  no  public disclosure.  This is not the first time this bill has come  before  the House.  In 2001, Representative  DUNCAN introduced similar legislation. I thank  him for his early leadership on this issue. And  in 2007,  I  introduced H.R. 1254 with Representatives  CLAY,  and  EMANUEL. That bill passed the House with an  overwhelming majority in the last Congress. I  urge my colleagues once again to support this  straightforward legislation.  ",2009
10,9,2009-01-07,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, today,  the House considers the Presidential Libraries  Donation Reform Act.  I was a cosponsor of  this bill when  it was originally  introduced  in  2007 and I am proud to stand in support of it  today.  Under current  law, a sitting president can  accept private donations in unlimited amounts  for  the purpose of building a presidential  library. There is no requirement that the donor’s  identity or the amount of the donation be disclosed. The potential for abuse here is obvious.  This bill requires presidential libraries fundraising organizations to disclose to Congress  information about the donors and their donations during and  immediately  following  the  president’s term in office.  The bill originally passed the House on suspension  in March 2007, and  returns  to  the  House floor today after receiving strong support in the Senate.  I encourage my colleagues  to  join me  in  supporting  this  important piece of bipartisan  legislation.  Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas. Madam  Speaker, I thank Congressman TOWNS for attempting to bring greater transparency to presidential library fundraising efforts with H.R. 36,  the ‘‘Presidential Library Donation Reform Act  of 2009.’’  We are facing a new day, with a new administration, and a new Democratic majority.  That is why it is important that we stay true to  our core values of  fairness,  transparency, a  accountability.  Starting with the lobbying and ethics reform,  we as a body understand that a responsible  government allows for openness. This legislation continues  to  rebuild our  trust with  the  American people.  This  legislation requires  in part  that,  ‘‘any  Presidential  library  fundraising  organization  shall submit on a quarterly basis with respect  to every contributor who gave the organization  a contribution or contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) totaling $200 or more for the  quarterly period.’’  Under current law, private organizations established for the purpose of building a presidential library can raise unlimited amounts of  money  from undisclosed donors while  the  President remains  in office.  It  takes nothing  more than common sense to see the potential  for abuse in this area and the need for basic  reform.  Presidential libraries serve an important purpose as depositories of presidential papers  and centers  for historical research.  In 1939,  President Franklin Roosevelt came up with the  idea of a privately-built, but  federally maintained library to house his presidential papers.  This split of  responsibilities between  the  public and the private sectors has continued  and has since been codified into law. In 1955,  the Presidential Libraries Act  formally established a system under which federally maintained  libraries would be built using  funds  raised by private organizations. More recent  amendments have required these private organizations  to provide an operating endowment  to  the National Archives  in addition  to  the library building.  Just  as  the  funding  requirements  have  grown, so have the libraries and their affiliated  institutions. Now  these  libraries are much  more  than basic research  facilities. They  include museums and conference centers along  with other tourist attractions; they are getting  more costly all the time.  The George H.W. Bush library was reported  to cost more  than $80 million  to build. The  Clinton library and museum cost about $165  million to build. News reports have indicated  that the fundraising goal for President Bush’s  library is $500 million—half a billion dollars—  before this institution is completed.  The vast scale of these secret fundraising  efforts creates opportunities for abuse. Donors  who do not need to be identified can give unlimited amounts of money to support these libraries while the President remains in office.  This  legislation would  require  that presidential  libraries disclose  the  identity of  their  donors to Congress and the National Archives  during their period of most intense fundraising,  which is while the President is in office and in  the several years after the end of his term.  This legislation is but one part of a larger effort by this Congress to restore honesty and  accountability in the Federal Government.  CONCLUSION  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman  TOWNSand the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform  for helping us build a  strong  foundation of  trust with  the American  people. I ask my colleagues to support me in  supporting H.R. 36.  ",2009

18,16,2009-01-07,Mr.  KENNEDY.,"  Today,  Madam  Speaker, I join my colleague Congressman LANGEVIN in this tribute to Senator Pell, the great statesman  from  Rhode Island. His name is well-known  throughout  this  country,  associated  most notably with the Pell Grant, the  grant that allows millions of young  people in this country opportunity to  get a higher education.  But Madam Speaker, we wanted to  pay tribute to Senator Pell not only  for what he did to open the doors for  millions in this country for economic  and educational opportunity, we wanted to pay tribute to him for all that  he’s done as a five-term Senator from  Rhode Island and one of the most distinguished Senators ever to serve not  only Rhode Island but this country.  He was the author of the Humanities  Act, National Endowment for the Humanities, which allows the arts to be  accessible  to  the average person as  well.  He was really the founder and the  person who really began the belief that  we ought to work cooperatively around  the world in terms of foreign policy. As  the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee, he was the one who led in  diplomacy.  And my friends, he was far ahead of  his  time as an environmentalist as  well.  Madam Speaker, we could talk about  his policies and what they meant to  our country, but to know him as a person is to really say the most about  Senator Pell. He was the most self-effacing, genteel, kind-hearted man that  you could ever know. And in a world of  rough-and-tumble politics, it’s hard to  find a genuine person such as that. And  for that reason, on a personal level I  was honored to know him and serve  with him and today join my colleague,  in paying  tribute  to  LANGEVIN,  JIM him.  Senator Pell left an extraordinary legacy that  is appreciated by so many people around the  world.  He spent his life in service to our country  from his start in 1960 as a U.S. Senator from  Rhode Island to his retirement in 1997, and in  the years beyond in which he remained active  in our State.  Our Nation has lost one of its most visionary  and thoughtful legislative leaders, and his hallmark, the Pell Grant, exemplifies his efforts to  promote  education  and  opportunity  for  all  Americans. So many  families,  though  they  may not know his name, were touched by the  work and generous spirit of Senator Pell.  There are so many areas in which he led  our country to the forefront such as oceanography,  foreign policy, and college  tuition assistance. His commitment  to public service  and his notable contributions to Rhode Island  and our Nation continue to inspire people of  all generations.  The magnitude and depth of his accomplishments may never be known because he  let  others take the credit and acclaim. His style  was understated yet magnanimous and his  work ushered in many essential policies that  have shaped our world today.  Earlier  this week, President Clinton, Vice  President-elect Biden, Senator KENNEDY, Senator REEDand many of his other friends from  around the globe paid tribute to his work and  celebrated his life.  He will be truly missed and my sympathies  and prayers are with his family. He leaves behind his wife of 64 years, wonderful Nuala  O’Donnell Pell; his son, Christopher T.H. Pell,  of Newport; a daughter, Dallas Pell, of New  York City; as well as five grandchildren and  five great grandchildren.  But those of us who will miss him extends  much farther. It is our country’s sorrow to lose  such a giant of the Senate and the Nation.  And with that, I would like to yield  the floor to my colleague and friend  from  the Second Congressional District, Congressman LANGEVIN.  ",2009
19,16,2009-01-07,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker, I  thank my colleague for yielding, and I  am honored to join with him today in  paying tribute to our State’s former  senior Senator, Senator Claiborne Pell,  who passed away on the 1st of this  year. He was an incredible public servant, and someone who I was proud to  call a friend and a mentor. He was one  of Rhode Island’s greatest statesmen  and gentlemen, as I said, who passed  away on the first day of 2009.  Born on November 22, 1918  into a  prominent and wealthy family, Senator  Pell was better known as a champion  for the common man and also the ‘‘Father of the Pell Grant Program.’’ After  receiving a degree from Princeton University, he served in the United States  Coast Guard during World War II and  later traveled the world as a Foreign  Service Officer of the State Department. In 1960, he was elected to his  first of six terms as a United States  Senator from Rhode Island. After retiring in 1997, he became our State’s longest-serving Senator.

21,23,2009-01-07,Mr. SHERMAN.," I will take much but  not all of this hour to speak. Roughly,  the first half of the presentation will  be on our economic situation. The second half will focus on foreign policy.  I know that I have a number of colleagues  that may  have  important  things to say to this House, and if they  come to the floor, I’ll be happy to yield  them a few minutes at a time that is  convenient for them.  Even with this long speech, I will not  be able to cover all the details that I’d  like  to  provide  to my  colleagues.  Therefore, I invite all my colleagues to  visit the relevant portion of my web  page, bradsherman.house.gov for more  of the details of the matters I’ll be discussing here.  In talking about our economy, I will  divide my speech first to talking about  matters relevant to the Financial Services Committee, on which I’ve served  for 12 years, and particularly the bill  known as TARP, or EESA, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, best  known to the public as the $700 billion  bailout bill.  The second part of my economic presentation will deal with the stimulus  package now being put together, particularly by the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means.  Now, I was a critic and twice voted  against the $700 billion bailout bill, the  so-called TARP. The supporters of that  bill will have to admit that it has not  restored  our  economy  as  the  proponents had advertised, and, in fact,  some of the worst times for the economy were the 2 to 3 weeks following its  passage.  On the other hand, those of us who  were critics should admit that the bill  has, frankly, cost the government far  less than I had anticipated. When I say  cost, I don’t mean just how much is  spent, but  from  that must be  subtracted the value of the securities, the  bonds and the stock certificates received by the Federal Government.  In this case, Secretary Paulson misled this House and the other body by  testifying that he would use the $700  billion to buy toxic assets, bad bonds.  Had he done that, and all of us voting  on the bill had every reason to believe  that he was telling us the truth, had he  carried out that policy, then he would  have bought,  for the money he had  spent, whether it’s the 350 billion he  has spent so far or the 700 billion that  I feared he would spend, he would have  spent that money in return for assets  of dubious value. That’s why they’re  called toxic assets.  In contrast, having misled the House  and the other body, Secretary Paulson  bought preferred stock in the various  financial institutions. In doing so, he  was overly generous to Wall Street as  to the terms, but, nevertheless, he did  secure assets for the Treasury that are  of substantial value.  Paulson’s shift,  frankly, was right  along the lines that many of us who  are critics of the bill had urged him to  adopt. And so those who supported the  bill, those who are critics of it, must  both recognize that what the Treasury  has done so far is far different from  what all of us believed would, in fact,  be the policy.  Now, we see that $350 billion has been  expended by the Treasury, and another  $350 billion  remains unspent.  I am  pleased  that  the Secretary  of  the  Treasury has not yet taken the procedural actions to release and give himself control of the remaining $350 billion.  It is my understanding that leadership will bring to this House a bill that  will  release  the  $350 billion  to  the  Treasury and will  impose additional  conditions. And I’d like to take a few  minutes to address what I think ought  to be in that bill.  First, is the issue of whether any of  the funds to be released, any of that  second $350 billion, will be available to  the Bush administration. Last month I  wrote the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee  saying  that we  should have limits on the amount that  could be spent by the Bush administration out of the second $350 billion. In  fact, I proposed that only $10 billion or  less be available to the Bush administration to deal with whatever exigencies it dealt with in its waning days. It  is my understanding that the bill that  will be brought before this House will  provide the Bush administration with  $0 to deal with whatever comes up in  its last week or so in office.  In any case,  I think, having seen  Paulson in action, the vast majority of  this House would believe that somewhere between 95 percent and 100 percent of the second $350 billion, if it is  made available to anyone in the executive branch should be made available  only to the Obama administration.  I should point out something about  process. It would be best if any bill  dealing with the second $350 billion was  actually dealt with in regular order.  Now, I’m not saying necessarily that  every committee of possible jurisdiction should do a full markup, but as we  deal with this economic crisis, at least  the primary committee as to each bill  should have a markup so that Members  can be heard, and the House can work  its will.  In addition, I would hope that the  Rules Committee would allow a reasonable number of amendments to be considered on the floor.  In addition, I would hope that the Financial Services Committee would give  the same scrutiny to the financial institutions who have received and are  likely  to  receive additional bailout  monies as we gave to the executives of  the three automobile makers.  We need extensive hearings. We need  to bring the titans of Wall Street down,  and we need to have these hearings at  both the full committee and the subcommittee level.  We do not want to give further credence to the accusation that Congress  and the administration have two standards for scrutinizing bailout requests,  one for those who shower before work  and a more severe standard for those  who must  shower  after work. We  should have at least the same amount  of scrutiny to an industry that has already received the bulk of $350 billion  as we provided to an automobile industry that  is requesting amounts  less  than 5 percent of that amount.  Now, what should we provide in the  way of restrictions to those who obtain  bailout  funds or  retain  the bailout  funds they have already received?  Federal dollars should be expended to  bail out private interests only on the  toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yield, the largest equity upside, the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. Even  when we bail out  individual homeowners rather than big time executives  and shareholders of major companies,  the Treasury should get a large share  of the profit that they earn when they  sell their homes.  Why is it so important that we are  tough on those who seek bailout funds?  There are  three  important  reasons.  First, being tough will increase support  for the program. The public  is currently focused on executive compensation and perks. I think it will soon  focus on the value of the securities the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:20 Jan 08, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07JA7.051 H07JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

27,37,2009-01-07,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President,  I  couldn’t help thinking today, as we  were sitting  in our weekly caucus—  that the senior member of our party  here in the Senate and the most senior  Member of the Senate, and the senior  Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished ROBERT C. BYRD, has now  served 50 years which is an all time  record as the longest serving Senator  in our country.  I have had the privilege of serving beside Senator BYRD for 34 years and am  proud to call him a very good friend.  When I first came to the Senate as a  new Member, it was ROBERTBYRDwho  took me aside and talked to me about  the rules of the Senate. Senator BYRD  took the time to speak about the rules  and history of the Senate, but he also  talked about the customs, and practices of this body. He spoke of the way  you treat each other, and how you  treat members of the other party. He  also explained the customary order of  recognition,  the kinds of courtesies  you use and the importance of taking  into consideration the needs of another  Senator.  Senator BYRD and I have sat here  through  inaugurations of Presidents,  and we have traveled together to funerals of colleagues with whom we have  served. His late wife, Erma, and my  wife, Marcelle, were friends and would  often ride together down to the Senate  for Senate gatherings. I know I would  always enjoy running into Erma and  in the grocery store in McLean,  VA. After a while, we would tend to  forget what it was we had gone to the  store for because we would be catching  up on the news of the Senate. Throughout it all, BOBBYRDhas always had  that great sense of what it means to be  a Senator.  I said many times on the floor of this  Senate that there are only 100 of us  BOB BYRD who have the privilege at any given  time to serve here and the American  people. BOBBYRD has always understood that better than most of us ever  will. We can be and should be the conscience of the Nation.  We are, above all, a Senate of reasonable men and women who live by very  specific rules, and we hurt both the  Senate and the country if we ignore  those  rules. So many  times  I have  heard Senator BYRD, who would see us  moving away  from  the  rules which  guide us, stand up to address the Chair  and remind each one of us what  it  means to be a Senator, what it means  to protect those principals and what it  means to serve this country.  Senators come and go. All of us will  at  some  time  leave  this body. But  those Senators who do the most to uphold and keep the functions and history of the Senate alive are the ones  who will make it a better place for the  next generation of Senators. Senator  has authored histories of this  Chamber, but then he has also lived the  history of this Chamber.  I salute my good friend from West  Virginia. I look forward to serving with  him for years to come.  ",2009
28,37,2009-01-07,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Madam President, I rise today to honor a giant of  the Senate, my colleague and the senior Senator from West Virginia, ROBERTC. BYRD.  Yesterday we watched a number of  new Senators take an enormously important oath to serve our country and  to defend our Constitution. I was included  in  taking  that  oath  and  I  couldn’t help but think of my new colleagues.  If  these new Senators are  looking for an inspiration, a guiding  light, or a model, the way that I did  some years ago, they need look no further than the seat directly behind our  distinguished majority leader.  In that seat they will find a man who  took that same oath that we did 50  years ago  today. Senator BYRD has  taken that oath a total of nine times.  He has cast more votes than anyone in  the history of the Senate. He has held  more leadership positions than anyone  in the history of the Senate. He has  served longer than anyone in the Senate. He has literally written the book  on the Senate and lived the story of  the Senate over five decades.  ROBERTC. BYRDis nothing short of a  legend. However, 50 years ago today he  was a young man from West Virginia  who married a coal miner’s daughter.  He had spent 4 years in the West Virginia Legislature and 6 years in the  U.S. House of Representatives.  No one could know in 1959 that he  would be a legend in 50 years. What  they did know was ROBERTCARLYLE  was an ambitious  self-starter  who would put himself through  law  school while serving in the U.S. Congress.  They knew Senator BYRDwas always  willing to help a colleague and to provide advice and guidance.

29,44,2009-01-07,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, in mid-  June, I asked Idahoans to share with  me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded by  the hundreds. The stories, numbering  well over 1,200, are heartbreaking and  touching. While  energy prices have  dropped in recent weeks, the concerns  expressed remain very relevant. To respect the efforts of those who took the  opportunity to share their thoughts, I  am submitting every e-mail sent to me  through an address set up specifically  for this purpose to the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD. This is not an issue that will  be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves  immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard.  Their  stories not only detail  their  struggles to meet everyday expenses  but also have  suggestions and  recommendations as to what Congress can  do now to tackle this problem and find  solutions that last beyond today. I ask  unanimous consent to have today’s letters printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Thank you for your newsletter regarding  the current problem of gasoline prices. I am  a widow living on Social Security income.  My car is a 1981 Volvo. Driving my car has  almost come to a standstill. I drive only for  necessities. I  feel  like a bear hibernating  over the winter. The idea of buying a new car  with better mileage is out of the question for  me.  As to the things our Nation should be  doing—these include drilling for oil wherever  available, using oil shale, developing nuclear  power, windmills, biofuels. Using corn  for  ethanol is the craziest idea of all. The commodities market is hitting new highs almost  daily. With the floods in Iowa, we cannot afford to use corn for oil. The animals that  need corn for food are affecting our prices in  the grocery store. Get rid of regulations that  cause energy companies to take years to develop energy or cause no action because of  the red tape of government.  Blaming the oil companies for so-called obscene profits is nonsense. Taxes on gasoline  are more than profits per gallon of gas that  the oil companies collect. Exxon has even  said that they are closing some stations because of non profit. It is sad that many do  not understand the basics of economics.  The American public has spoken. Stop listening  to  the environmentalists. Because  there has been no foresight, we are suffering  now for the lack of action by those in the  past who we elected to represent us. Both  parties are responsible, but blaming does not  get the job done.  It is embarrassing to read that France has  developed their nuclear power while we just  sit and talk about it. It is sad knowing that  foreign countries are acquiring leases to drill  for oil in our backyard, while we just sit and  watch what is going on in the Gulf of Mexico  and grumble about it. It is humiliating to  hear those who say we are becoming a third  world nation. Americans are known for their  innovation.  Gasoline prices are affecting food prices,  small businesses and the cost of all goods  and services. Independent truckers are suffering. We rely on them for delivery of our  food and goods to market. If their numbers  decrease because of their cost of doing business, it will cause an additional increase in  prices or possibly the disappearance of some  goods. I do not think we want that to happen  to our food supplies.  The time has come to act. Now is the time.  We must not waste time. The public is begging for some common sense to solve these  problems. Egos must be ignored lest we suffer more. Corporate America knows how to  solve these problems. Do not hinder them  any more with government red tape.  LAVERGNE, Hayden.  Our family lives about 30 miles from Idaho  Falls where we do most of our business. My  daughter and I also drive about 32 miles each  way to our places of work so we are impacted  every day. Our best guess is that we are  spending about $400 per month more now  than we did when gas was $2 per gallon. So  far our response has been to curtail vacation  traveling and reduce other unnecessary purchases.  Solutions (in order of preference):  1. Pursue increased domestic oil drilling  including off-shore and ANWR and encourage  construction of more refineries. I believe environmental concerns have been greatly exaggerated and need to be evaluated based on  their cost effectiveness relative to their impact on the cost of living versus risk to our  quality of life.  2. Pursue alternative energy sources only  as  far they are cost-effective. If bio-fuels  need to be subsidized in order to maintain  production, they are obviously not cost-effective.  3. Pursue nuclear power generation (we are  20 years behind). There is also potential for  hydrogen as a by-product that could be used  as an alternative to gasoline. I have doubts  about wind generation as a cost-effective alternative energy source, and I personally do  not care for it is adverse effect on the natural beauty of Idaho’s landscapes.  4. Pursue  improved coal-fired electrical  generation. I also have serious concerns regarding the apparent race to reduce CO2  emissions at any cost when there is so little  real evidence that proves a correlation with  global warming (also unverified).  5. Encourage more mass transit systems in  our  larger cities and offer  incentives  for  their use. I was in San Diego, California last  week and the traffic was absolutely mind-  boggling.  6. Encourage better  individual planning  and carpooling across the nation. There are  way too many of us making unnecessary  trips to the store and letting our kids drive  to school every day when we have buses  making the same trip, but I suppose this will  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:54 Jan 08, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07JA6.011 S07JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
30,51,2009-01-07,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I seek  recognition to speak on legislation I  am introducing that will require the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold at least one public hearing  before issuance of a permit affecting  public or private land use in a locality.  I introduced legislation on this issue at  the end of the 110th Congress, and fully  expect  it to remain relevant as we  move forward with upgrades to our energy infrastructure, possibly as part of  an economic  stimulus package. The  legislation has been updated; namely,  it now allows  for a second hearing  when officially requested by a county  or local government to address issues  not addressed at the original hearing.  Increasing  demand  for  electricity  throughout the Northeast is putting a  strain on energy infrastructure in my  State, necessitating new transmission  lines and natural gas pipelines and the  expansion of existing ones. In southwestern and northeast Pennsylvania  transmission  line  expansions  are  planned over hundreds of miles of private property, while in the southeast  natural gas pipeline expansions are underway.  There is no doubt these projects can  be invasive, and rarely do they fail to  be controversial. I make a point of  touching all of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties each year. In traveling Pennsylvania this Fall I heard a lot of complaints, which didn’t come as a surprise. I heard frequently from constituents who oppose these infrastructure  projects, and who felt their concerns  were being ignored by the energy companies and by FERC.  I realize there will always be some  opposition  to  large  infrastructure  projects. What  is unacceptable, however, is for the people of my State to  feel that their voices were not heard,  that their issues were ignored. It may  be the case that these projects are necessary. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is the authority, and in  exercising its authority it must be sensitive to local concerns.  To address this I propose simply that  FERC hold a hearing in these affected  communities. In many cases this is already done, but my legislation makes  it mandatory. State Public Utility  Commissions, who have a great say in  these matters, are beyond Congress’  reach. But where the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission is involved we  can take steps to ensure that our constituents’ concerns receive due consideration. Holding a hearing may not  lead to all sides agreeing on the proper  route forward, but at the very least my  Pennsylvania constituents will come  away with the satisfaction of having  publicly aired their grievances.  To ensure that constituent concerns  are given all due consideration, my legislation allows for affected parties to  petition for a second hearing, provided  certain conditions are met. In order for  a second hearing to occur, a county  government, or a municipal government within the affected county, must  petition  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a second hearing. A second hearing will only occur  to address an issue that was not addressed at the initial hearing, and the  hearing shall occur between 30 and 60  days after approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The safeguards included in this legislation are critical to protecting individual property rights. As the Nation  moves forward in making needed updates to its infrastructure, defending  citizens’ constitutional right to redress  their government with their concerns  should be paramount for this Congress.  I will continue to fight to allow my  constituents to be heard when Federal  projects will  affect  their  homeowners and landowners.  rights  as  f  STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED  BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS  By Mr. BINGAMAN:  S. 22.

32,65,2009-01-07,Mr. PASCRELL.," Madam Speaker, it is my  pleasure  today  to  introduce  the  ‘‘Paterson  Great Falls National Historical Park Act’’ as  my first act in the 111th Congress. This bipartisan legislation was approved by the House in  October 2007, and would designate a National  Park at the majestic Great Falls in Paterson,  NJ. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation as soon as possible.  Fifteen miles west of New York City,  the  Great Falls was the second largest waterfall in  colonial America. No other natural wonder in  America has played such an important role in  our nation’s historic quest  for  freedom and  prosperity. At the Great Falls, Alexander Hamilton conceived and  implemented a plan  to  harness the force of water to power the new  industries  that would secure our economic  independence.  Hamilton  told Congress and  the American  people that at the Great Falls he would begin  implementation of his ambitious strategy  to  transform a rural agrarian society dependent  upon slavery into a modern economy based  on  freedom.  True  to  Hamilton’s  vision,  Paterson became a great manufacturing city,  producing  the Colt  revolver,  the  first  submarine, the aircraft engine for the first trans-  Atlantic flight, more locomotives than any city  in the Nation, and more silk than any city in  the world.  New Jersey’s Great Falls  is  the only National Historic District that includes both a National Natural Resource and a National Historic  Landmark.  In  a  special Bicentennial  speech in Paterson with the spectacular natural beauty of  the Great Falls  in  the background,  the  late President Gerald R. Ford  said, ‘‘We can see the Great Falls as a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make  America  the most powerful Nation  in  the  world.’’  Preeminent Hamilton biographers, an esteemed former Smithsonian Institution curator,  the former chief of the National Park Service  Historic American Engineering Record, and  distinguished professors at Yale, Princeton,  Harvard, NYU, Brown and other universities  have filed letters with the National Park Service strongly recommending a National Historical Park for the Great Falls Historic District.  Editorial boards, Federal, State, and local officials and community groups have also endorsed the campaign to award a National Park  Service designation to the Falls.

COSTELLO  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 7, 2009  ",2009
34,65,2009-01-07,Mr. COSTELLO.," Madam Speaker,  for  the  past several years, Israelis living near Gaza  have endured a continual state of fear due to  the thousands of rocket attacks launched from  there by Hamas. When the six-month cease  fire between Hamas and Israel recently ended,  Hamas responded almost immediately by firing more than 70 missiles at civilian targets  within Israel. On December 27th, Israel, in an  act of self defense, struck at Hamas targets in  Gaza in response to these continued attacks,  and I want to express my strong support for  Israel’s right of self-defense.  Israel has taken meaningful steps in recent  years to push the peace process forward, including unilaterally withdrawing from Gaza in  2005. Unfortunately, Hamas  has  not met  Israel’s efforts towards a peaceful coexistence,  and has instead increased military operations  against  its neighbor and continues  to deny  Israel’s right to exist.  These unfortunate developments are tragic,  but have been precipitated by Hamas’ aggression. Hamas must stop the rocket attacks and  all parties in the region need to commit to renewing efforts at peace. The U.S. should remain involved in the peace process and I will  continue to work with my colleagues in Congress towards this goal.  THE  INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT  OF  COLUMBIA  HOUSE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2009  HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON  OFTHEDISTRICTOFCOLUMBIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 7, 2009  ",2009
35,65,2009-01-07,Ms. NORTON.," Madam Speaker, today I am  introducing, I believe for the last time, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, simultaneously with our Senate partners, Senators JOELIEBERMANand ORINHATCH. The bill  we introduce today also will add two permanent House seats,  the  first  increase  in 96  years. It therefore carries a triple bonus: the  first vote for the District of Columbia after 212  years, an additional seat  for Utah, and  two  new permanent seats for the House of Representatives itself. The citizens of the District  of Columbia are deeply grateful for the persistent partnership and a bipartisan dedication  that Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator HATCH  continue to bring to this bill, and for the continued support of Utah Governor Jon Huntsman.  Because of  the  importance  to  the city of  achieving the vote after more than two centuries, the D.C. Voting Rights Act is my first  bill of the 111th Congress. This year we introduce the bill as members of the armed services from the District of Columbia are again  engaged  in war abroad.  In gratitude  for  the  service of our residents serving today, and of  those who have served since our country was  founded, I dedicate the bill this year to the first  soldier from the District to die for his country  in  the  Iraq War, 21-year-old D.C. National  Guard Specialist, Daryl Dent, and to the District’s  first unknown soldier  to die after he  picked up arms to fight for liberation on the  promise of taxation without representation. Although two centuries apart, the first to die in  these wars had  in common  fighting  for  the  vote. Our first residents here fought in the War  for Independence. Specialist Dent gave his life  ensuring the vote for Iraqi citizens, a right he  did not live to get for himself  Today’s bill is the first in the Free and Equal  series of bills that I will introduce this session  to complete the full roster of citizenship rights  the residents of the Nation’s capital, that the  first soldiers were promised and for which today’s soldiers continue  to give  their  lives.

36,72,2009-01-07,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Bob Munson and the employees  of  Munson’s  Chocolates  which  is  headquartered in Bolton, Connecticut.  During the recent holiday season, I had the  privilege of visiting Iraq and Afghanistan with  a Congressional Delegation led by Representative GENE of Mississippi and witnessed  first hand  the  important work being  done by the men and women of our armed  forces. Our group spent time meeting with civilian and military  leaders  serving on  the  ground in each country. The holidays are always a difficult time for the men and women  of  the armed  forces as  they are away  from  their loved ones. One of the things that they  will  tell you makes  this  time of year a  little  easier  is  to enjoy some of  the comforts of  home.  Thanks  to  Bob Munson,  President  of  Munson’s Chocolates of Bolton, the men and  women of  the 890th Engineer Battalion and  the 926th Engineer Brigade, Multi-National Division currently serving in Baghdad were able  to enjoy a sweet reminder of home. A  few  days before Christmas Congressman TAYLOR  arranged for 2,000 pounds of shrimp gumbo to  be served to the battalion and Munson’s donated almost 600 Connecticut made chocolate  bars for dessert. This gift is just another example of  the generosity of  the Munson  family,  who  for generations has been active supporters of the military community.  The Munson  family of employees  is no  stranger  to  the heartache  families endure  while their loved ones are serving overseas.  During my visit to the Munson factory, I had  the honor of meeting Kay Doherty. Kay’s son  Stephen recently returned from a tour in Iraq.  As Kay can attest,  the holidays are an extremely difficult and  trying  time  for military  families which is why this generous gift is so  timely.  f  HONORING  WAS  NO  TEACHERS  JADE MOORE, THERE  BETTER  FRIEND  OF  HON.

His support for  charter schools, public school choice,  performance  pay  for  teachers  and  school leaders was highlighted at the  hearing.

42,4,2009-01-29,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, as always, I care for the Senator from California. We are good friends. You know,  I hasten to point out that her own  State of California has approved unborn  child State  plans. Look,  this  amendment by definition has nothing  to do with abortion since women who  seek help covering their unborn children’s health are not women seeking  abortion. They are separate, and the  Senator should not try to mix them.  This is not an issue about abortion.  This is an issue about a living, unborn  child and her or his mother.  I might add that 14 States have approved unborn child State plans, including the States of Arkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Oklahoma,  Oregon,  Rhode  Island,  Tennessee,  Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin have  all approved unborn child State plans.  I agree with the Senator, the bill has  worked beautifully, the CHIP bill, for  the last 10 years. I know. I wrote every  word in it and did so with Senators  KENNEDY, ROCKEFELLER, CHAFEE, and  others, as a matter of fact. But I don’t  think anybody doubts that I carried  the ball in getting that bill through  the Finance Committee and the whole  Congress.  I see a one-sided attempt here to  change the bill in ways that will make  it less effective and not cover as many  children as it should. Some argue the  legislation already gives States the option to cover pregnant women, so this  amendment is not necessary. But the  distinct difference between this amendment and what is in the underlying bill  is that this amendment allows States  to cover children before birth. Children  have health needs as much before as  after they are born, so legislation to  promote  children’s health  ought  to  cover them. Let me emphasize that  this is a State option, not a State requirement.  Some argue this amendment is an attempt to inject, as I think the distinguished Senator from California has argued, the abortion issue into a bipartisan effort to protect children’s health  through the authorizing of the CHIP  program. The truth is exactly the opposite. As I said when introducing my  amendment, this has nothing to do  with abortion. It has everything to do  with promoting children’s health, and  any reasonable person ought to be concerned about the unborn as much as  they are the born and, of course, the  mother  involved.  This  amendment  takes care of all three.  I feel very strongly about this. I do  not think anybody should try to make  this an abortion issue—not myself, not  the distinguished Senator  from California, or anybody else, for that matter. I don’t see how anybody can vote  against an amendment that protects  the life of the unborn child after having read the Constitution about  its  great desire to protect life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. That is what  this amendment is all about.  I feel strongly about it. I hope our  colleagues will support it, because it  would be a great thing to help this bill  along. I would feel much better if this  was amended. I have to admit, I do not  feel good about the approach that has  been taken by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.  The fact is that Senator GRASSLEY  and I carried the ball for the last 2  BAUCUS, ROCKEFELLER, DURBIN,  years, working with Senators REID,  and  others; working with the House, Speaker of the House PELOSI, Rahm Emanuel  and others who were there, including  STENYHOYER.  We worked closely together to do  CHIPRA I. We got an overwhelming  vote in the Senate. On CHIPRA II, we  got an overwhelming vote in the Senate, enough to override the President’s  veto in the Senate. I do not think that  would have happened but for the bipartisan effort we put together. We had a  solid, strong vote in the House, but not  enough  to  override  the President’s  veto.  Now, I have heard people run down  President Bush for his vetoes on CHIP.  I think President Bush followed the advice of some very young advisers in the  White House who basically gave him  bad advice. Had he allowed CHIPRA I  or CHIPRA II to go through, we would  not be having this awful debate today;  we would all be together. The whole  Congress would have been  together,  and this whole effort would have been  truly bipartisan. We could have set a  bipartisan tone right off the bat, instead of this partisan tone that has  been set by bringing up the bill without even talking to the two lead Republicans who in 2007 worked so carefully, honestly, and diligently to try  and bring about a bipartisan resolution  for a new CHIP bill.  And, by the way, we took a lot of  flack in the process from some in the  administration and some on our side  for supporting the legislation in 2007.  We took it. We took it gladly. And our  colleagues on the other side saw us  take it. They saw us stand firm. They  saw Senator GRASSLEY and myself  stand on the floor, along with a whole  host of others, in a bipartisan way, putting together what would have made  CHIP even better for the next certainly  5 years.  This bill only funds the CHIP program for 41⁄2years, because if they had  gone the extra half year, it would have  priced the bill out of the marketplace.  But I have to say, we are going to have  to come up with that money anyway,  and end up going that extra half year.  So  everybody better understand all  that is being done today by my friends  on the left, ignoring people, like me  and  Senator  who  have  worked so closely with them—and they  have a right to do that. I can live with  that, as I vote against their partisan  bill.  All I can say is they have a right to  do it. But it is the wrong thing to do.  It is the wrong way to start off this  Congress after the President himself  has shown such a propensity to want to  work together. I have to say, I was  there when the President came and  spoke to our caucus last Tuesday. He  was  impressive. He was  friendly. He  was making every effort to be bipartisan. But he apparently had not fully  examined the stimulus bill that has  been passed only in a partisan way by  GRASSLEY,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:11 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.004 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

47,11,2009-01-29,Mr. WICKER.," Mr. President,  the  SCHIP legislation the Senate is considering this week purports to provide  more health insurance for our Nation’s  poorest children. But in truth, the bill  shortchanges the neediest of children  in States such as Mississippi. Instead  of paying taxpayer dollars for our poorest children, those who need health insurance the most, the bill we are considering today gives taxpayer-funded  health insurance to middle-class families in wealthy States. The SCHIP bill  we will be voting on today does nothing to ensure that all American children under 200 percent of the poverty  level have health insurance. In fact,  the bill diverts  this  important program, which I have supported for years,  away from its intended purpose. SCHIP  was designed to cover low-income children between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That comes  to $22,000 to $44,000 per year for a family of four. These families require assistance under SCHIP because  they  earn too much to qualify for Medicaid,  but they are not able to afford private  health coverage for their children. This  was the intent of SCHIP.  What we ought to be doing in this  bill is prioritizing low-income American children and making sure as many  uninsured poor kids as possible are covered under the increased funding we  are going to provide. Instead, this bill  allows States to expand their programs  without demonstrating they have covered the poorest children first. In my  State  of Mississippi,  for  example,  SCHIP covers 65,000 children, but there  are another 30,000 children below 200  percent of the poverty level who are  without health  insurance. This  bill  would not cover those children, even  with the expanded funding.  Other States that are similarly situated include Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Arkansas. I  urge the Senators from those States to  join me in an effort to correct this inequity. I urge all Senators to make  this bill better so we make sure we include poorest of the poor children first.  In the past decade since SCHIP was  created, the number of uninsured poor  children has decreased from 28 percent  to 15 percent. But we cannot, in the  face of that success story, neglect the  remaining 15 percent. Many of them  are in the States I have mentioned.  Fifteen percent of America’s poorest  children still do not have health care,  and we are debating a bill that would  expand SCHIP beyond its intended purpose, to cover higher income families  and other adults.  SCHIP allotments in fiscal year 2009  will be $5 billion. Under this bill we  would almost double that amount to $9  billion per year. But only an additional  $79 million  is needed to cover these  poor uncovered children in States such  as Mississippi. If we are going to almost double the size of the program,  we ought to make sure poorest of the  poor are covered.  If this bill were really about health  care for poor children, we would guarantee each State sufficient  funds to  cover every child in a family below 200  percent of the poverty level. It is that  simple. And we would do that before  moving on to cover more affluent families in the more affluent States.  Senator COCHRAN and  I have  submitted an amendment that would do  that. Our amendment would prohibit  States from receiving funds to cover  individuals above 200 percent of the  poverty level until we can guarantee  that 90 percent—not 100 percent but 90  percent—of  the poorest children nationwide are covered.  The result of our amendment would  be that the more affluent States would  simply have to wait if they want to  cover middle-class  children,  if  they  want to cover families making as much  as $88,000 a year or more. They would  have to wait until the poorest of the  poor children in Mississippi and Arkansas and North Carolina and North Dakota and Nebraska and Iowa are covered.  I have been watching the votes this  week.  It appears the  leadership has  locked in a majority to resist amendments of this nature. I thought the bill  was about making it easier to cover  children under 200 percent of the poverty level—between 100 percent and 200  percent. If amendments such as that of  Senator COCHRAN and myself are not  agreed to, we have to wonder is the  real intent of this legislation to replace our private health care system  with a government-run system at the  expense of people who need help the  most?  One of my colleagues yesterday said  we are ruining SCHIP. I have to concur  with that,  if this  legislation  is not  amended. I urge my colleagues to join  me in bringing the focus of SCHIP back  where it belongs, on helping poor children.  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

48,18,2009-01-29,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Montana is recognized.  ,2009
49,18,2009-01-29,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, basically the Bunning amendment is the  fourth amendment that would put a  cap on eligibility. Yesterday the Senate rejected the Cornyn amendment  that would cap it at 200 percent of poverty, a Roberts amendment with a cap  of $65,000, and a Murkowski amendment with a cap of 300 percent of poverty. All these amendments, including  the Bunning  amendment,  have  the  same flaw; that is, they would raise the  possibility of kicking kids off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan; that is,  they  are  diminishing  amendments.  They do not add, they subtract. The  kids currently on the Children’s Health  Insurance Plan are taken off. That is  not something I think we want to do.  The specific amendment in question  here will have that effect. It will basically say that because the States that  have been mentioned here essentially  get a match rate according to the Children’s Health Insurance Plan, that because of the amendment—the amendment says they will get less, they will  get the Medicaid match rate, which is  less than the Children’s Health Insurance Plan; therefore, those kids cannot  participate.  Theoretically there could be some  participation because the match rate  in Medicaid, which I think is around 15  percent lower—in the case of let’s say  New York or New Jersey—than the  Children’s  Health  Insurance  Plan  match. But still the effect is the same.  If this amendment were to go into effect, children currently in, say, New  Jersey who  receive  the  Children’s  Health Insurance Plan match rate will  probably get kicked off. A lot will be  kicked off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan because the match rate is  lower, down to the Medicaid rate.  That is not right. The fact is all of  these  amendments,  including  the  Bunning amendment, are restrictive. It  is constrictive. It is a reducing amendment. It pressures to take children off  the Children’s Health Insurance Plan  rather than add children.  People talk about 200 percent of poverty, 300 percent of poverty, et cetera.  I think New Jersey is at 350 percent of  poverty. One interesting point there is  they are at that rate, A, because they  asked for it and, B, because President  Bush’s administration gave a waiver  and said, yes, go ahead and do it. President Bush, his administration, and the  Republican Secretary of HHS,  said,  yes, New York, go ahead and do that.  That is fine. You should do that.  One can guess why they may have  granted that waiver. The reason is because when you talk poverty  levels,  such as 200 percent of poverty, that is  a national figure. It is not a different  number for each State, it is what is the  national number. New Jersey, I think,  has the highest per capita income of  any State in the Nation. Clearly, the  Federal poverty level which applies to  New Jersey probably does not match  what the realities are in that State.  The realities are if you take a family a  little bit above the national median income, a family in that State, in New  Jersey,  is probably  facing the same  economic pressures and difficulties—  paying for health insurance, providing  for  the kids and  the kids’ medical  bills—as would the average family in a  State where the median income is the  same as the national median income.  That is probably why New Jersey asked  for that waiver and probably why the  Republican Secretary of Health and  Human Services granted that waiver.  But that is where we are. That is history. It makes sense.  The fact is, this amendment says, no,  we are going to undo that, even though  New Jersey is used to it, even though  New Jersey applied for the waiver and  lawfully was granted the waiver, we  say: No, no, not that anymore. We are  going to reduce the match rate you and  New Jersey get and it is again going to  have the pressure of hurting kids in  that State and taking kids off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan. That is  not the right thing to do.  I therefore respectfully urge Senators  to not support this restrictive amendment which does not add kids to the  Children’s  Health  Insurance  Plan.

What I say will  have some rebuttal to what the distinguished chairman of the committee has  said just.  Medicaid and the Children’s Health  Insurance Plan were created to cover  low-income  children. An  income  of  more than $63,000 for a family of four is  not low income. I know the Senators  from the State of New York and New  Jersey will argue that $63,000 is low income in their States. I know they will  talk about the cost of living in those  States.  As an example,  the median home  price  in Des Moines  is greater than  that in Binghampton, Buffalo, or Rochester in the State of New York.  The underlying bill says all States  can cover above 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. I think that should  be limited, as it was in the second bill  that was a bipartisan bill passing the  Senate in 2007. But if we are going to  allow States to cover above 300 percent,  all States  should  be  treated  equally,  and  an  exception  for  two  States—and  I might emphasize only  two States—is not fair, and it is not  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:11 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.036 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

So I have taken the outreach section out.  However, the amendment is still very  simple. It removes the exception for  New York and New Jersey to cover  families above 300 percent of poverty  and get the highest SCHIP matching  rate. Instead, they would get the lower  Medicaid matching rate covering these  families like every other State in the  Union. So you have a choice today: Require the people of your State to pay  more taxes so New York and New Jersey  can  cover  families who make  $77,000 or $88,000 or treat every State  the same.  ",2009

86,32,2009-01-29,Mr. DEMINT.," Mr. President, I would  like to make some comments about  DeMint amendment No. 85. This is an  amendment that I believe is very important  to American  families,  taxpayers. Here  in Washington,  there  seems to always be enough money to  help those who cannot take care of  themselves. Most of the time, that is a  good thing because we certainly want  to have those safety nets for those families, particularly  families who need  health care for their children. The difficulty is that those families who are  working and are struggling and are  being independent often have to pay  the price for that.  I have personal  family experience  that drives this whole issue home. As  we consider the expansion of the children’s health bill to expand it to folks  with higher incomes, I realize that affects my own family.  My oldest  son  is married with a  child, expecting another. He is back in  graduate school, doing some part-time  work, struggling to make ends meet  and pay for his own health insurance.  As they expect their second child, with  that high-deductible policy, they are  paying for most of their health care  themselves.  As he heard about the debate on this  issue as well as some of the other bailout  issues, he mentioned to me—he  said: Dad, it is hard in my situation to  make enough money to pay for our own  health care. I want to be independent,  but I realize the tax dollars I do pay  are paying for the benefits of others  who are often making more than I am.  He has friends in school who are on  welfare and food stamps and Medicaid,  taking everything they can from the  Government.  But most  Americans,  most middle-class Americans and even  those who fall below middle class, are  struggling today to make ends meet on  their own and not be dependent on the  Government. The amendment I have  introduced tries to achieve some level  of  fairness  to  those American  taxpayers who are working and trying to  make ends meet.  My son could qualify for SCHIP, this  children’s health program. Certainly  while he is in school he is below 200  percent of poverty. But right now he  pays for his own health care. We even  charge him taxes on the amount he has  to spend for his own health care. Then  his regular taxes have to go to help all  his friends who are living off the Government dole.  If we are going to help families with  children, we ought to be fair about it.  This bill we are considering expands  the children’s health plan. The current  law in America certainly covers American citizens, but the Federal money is  not allowed to be used for noncitizens.  That is basically part of our immigration deal. When folks come here and  they are sponsored, the agreement is  that for 5 years they take care of themselves and they are not a burden on the  American taxpayer.  But the bill we are debating today  changes  that  law.  It gives benefits,  health care, to noncitizens at the expense of middle-class working Americans. I do not want to take that away.  That is not what this bill is about, my  amendment. I am not changing anything this bill already offers.  But what this amendment does is it  gives every American family with children, qualifying  children under  the  children’s health plan we are debating,  an above-the-line deduction of up to  $1,500. And what it is, it gives American citizens the same benefit we are  giving non-Americans, noncitizens, in  this underlying bill.  We do not ask the Government to  pay for their health care. We say, as a  matter of fairness, we are not going to  make them pay income taxes on what  they have to spend on health care for  their children. That  is what this  is  about, a deduction  for  the  cost of  health care for children.  We phase this out as income goes up.  If a family qualifies for the AMT, they  cannot get this deduction. So this is  about middle-class Americans, people  who are actually out there today trying to make it on their own without  Government help, paying for their own  health care. We are not going to charge  them taxes on the cost of their health  care with this amendment.  Specifically, the DeMint amendment,  a taxpayer fairness amendment, would  allow American families, citizens and  legal immigrant families, the ability to  receive a tax deduction of up to $1,500  for each child to cover health care-related costs.  This deduction, per child,  is comparable to the average Federal share of  the benefit provided to any child under  this SCHIP bill, the underlying child  health care bill. But no family who is  already claiming SCHIP or Medicaid or  any Federal health plan would be able  to use this deduction.  This deduction is for Americans with  that spirit of  independence who, regardless of how little they are making,  want to pay their own way. And let’s  not penalize them for it. Let’s not tax  what they have to pay for health care  and then give it free to someone else.  Let’s not make them pay taxes to help  pay for someone else’s health care and  still leave them out in the cold.  This is a matter of basic fairness. I  encourage my colleagues, Republican  and Democrat, if the whole point of  this legislation is to help struggling  families with children make sure they  have health care  for their children,  let’s be fair to American citizens and  at  least give them an equal benefit  that we are giving to noncitizens. Let’s  not make middle-class working Americans pay for health care for noncitizens  while we are basically taxing the struggling American worker who is trying  to pay for it on their own.  I think a vote on this amendment  will be coming up relatively shortly.  Again, I encourage all of my colleagues  to vote for the DeMint taxpayer fairness amendment.  I reserve the remainder of my time,  and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

119,46,2009-01-29,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, in the 4  years since the federal ban on assault  weapons was allowed to expire, hundreds of people in this country have  died and been  injured by previously  banned weapons. The Brady Center to  Prevent Gun Violence report, ‘‘Assault  Weapons: Massed Produced Mayhem,’’  details the deaths of 165 people and the  injury of 185 people by assault weapons  since the ban expired. This includes the  death and injury of 38 police officers.  The simple fact is, our communities  are less safe than they were 4 years  ago.  The Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives described assault weapons in their Assault Weapons Profile as weapons  ‘‘designed for  rapid fire and close quarter shooting at  human beings. That is why they were  put together the way they were. You  will not find these guns in a duck blind  or at the Olympics. They are mass produced mayhem.’’  Unlike  semiautomatic hunting  rifles, which are designed to be fired from the shoulder  and rely on the accuracy of a precisely  aimed projectile, assault weapons are  designed to be fired at the hip and to  maximize their ability to rapidly shoot  multiple human targets.  The  report also outlines  the dangerous weapons race law enforcement  officers have been forced to enter in an  effort to counter the increasing likelihood that they will be confronted by a  criminal wielding an assault weapon.  In addition to the common criminal,  assault weapons are highly attractive  weapons for terrorists. The ease with  which they can currently be purchased,  combined with their designed ability to  inflict as much damage as possible,  make them ideal tools for conspiring  terrorists. Just last year five men were  arrested in New Jersey with a stockpile  of assault weapons, while planning to  attack the U.S. States Army base at  Fort Dix.  Despite the overwhelming support of  the law enforcement community, the  ongoing threat of terrorism and bipartisan support in the Senate, the assault  weapons ban was not allowed to expire.  Now,  4  years  later,  19  previously  banned military-style assault weapons,  some capable of firing up to 600 rounds  per minute, are once again pervading  our  streets and neighborhoods. This  Congress we must take up and pass  sensible gun safety legislation, including  reinstating  the assault weapons  ban.  f  BLAIR NOMINATION  ",2009
120,46,2009-01-29,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I support the nomination of ADM Dennis  Blair to be Director of National Intelligence. I do so as a strong supporter of  intelligence reform and in the belief  that Admiral Blair brings not only a  keen  understanding  of  the  current  challenges to interagency cooperation  but an enthusiasm for reform. I am  also encouraged by his consistent and  repeated  commitments  to keep  the  congressional intelligence committees  fully and currently informed, and his  desire  to end  the  stonewalling conducted by  the Bush administration.  The confirmation process has raised a  number of issues of concern that I believe have been adequately addressed,  although it is my hope and expectation  that Admiral Blair, if confirmed, will  work with me and other members of  the committee on these, as well as  other important matters.  Admiral Blair has committed to ending the Bush administration practice of  hiding programs such as the CIA detention  program  and  the  President’s  warrantless wiretapping program from  the full committee and has said that  these programs ‘‘were less effective and  did not have sufficient legal and constitutional foundations because the intelligence committees were prevented  from carrying out their oversight responsibilities.’’ He has also committed  to breaking down the stovepiping of  oversight whereby  Intelligence Committee members are denied access to  important Department of Defense activities. These commitments are a critical  first  step  in ensuring effective  oversight and in reestablishing a collaborative  relationship  between  our  two branches of Government.  While I was disappointed with Admiral Blair’s refusal, at his hearing, to  characterize waterboarding as torture,  I am confident that he will carry out  President  Obama’s  Executive  order  prohibiting  ‘‘enhanced  interrogation  techniques.’’ I am also assured by his  statement  that  ‘‘the United States  must not render or otherwise transfer  anyone to a country unless we have  credible assurances that they will not  be subject to torture or other unacceptable treatment.’’  His statements on privacy, civil liberties and checks and balances have  also been reassuring. He has expressed  concern about the U.S. Government’s  accumulation of detailed private information on U.S. citizens. He has reaffirmed that FISA is the ‘‘only legal  authority for conducting surveillance  within  the United States  for  intelligence purposes.’’ He told me at his  hearing that he would submit  intelligence programs to the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel at  the outset, so that they are conducted  under  clear  legal  authorities. And,  more generally, he has stated that he  sees it has his responsibility to ‘‘make  clear that protecting the privacy and  civil liberties of Americans is as important as gathering intelligence.’’ I do  have  concerns  about his  statement  that he supports immunity for companies  that allegedly  cooperated with  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:42 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.032 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
121,53,2009-01-29,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, history  has proven time and time again that  the markets are not self-policing. Today’s financial crisis is due in part to  the Government’s failure to regulate  key market  participants,  including  hedge funds that have become unregulated  financial heavyweights  in  the  U.S. economy. So I am joining today  with my colleague Senator GRASSLEY  of Iowa to introduce the Hedge Fund  Transparency Act, and I thank Senator  GRASSLEYfor his leadership on this and  in so many other areas involving oversight of our financial institutions.  Hedge funds sound complicated, but  they are  simply private  investment  funds in which investors have agreed to  pool their money under the control of  an investment manager. What distinguishes them  from other  investment  funds is that hedge funds are typically  open only to ‘‘qualified purchasers,’’ an  SEC term referring to institutional investors  such  as  pension  funds  and  wealthy individuals with assets over a  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:10 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.050 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
122,60,2009-01-29,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, today,  along with Senators WHITEHOUSE, MURand DODD,  I am  introducing a bill to triple the number of  Foreign Service officers working with  USAID.  As we take stock of America’s image  in the world, it’s clear that we need to  do more  to help countries  stabilize  their society and their economy.  Our own security depends on the stability of far-flung places beyond our  borders.  America’s generosity and ability to  help other countries is becoming more  important to the effectiveness of our  foreign policy.  In the U.S., the responsibility for development  falls  largely  to  the U.S.  Agency for International Development,  or USAID.  USAID was founded by the Kennedy  administration in 1961. It became the  first U.S. foreign assistance organization with the primary goal of  long  term economic and social development  efforts overseas.  During its first decade, it had more  than  5,000 Foreign Service Officers  serving all over the world, often in the  most difficult of conditions.  Today—at  a  time when  the U.S.  needs to show its leadership overseas  more than ever—USAID operates with  just 1,000 Foreign Service Officers.  With so  few people to deploy, our  hands are tied and we’re missing opportunities to build bridges and foster diplomacy.  For example, more than seven years  after U.S. took military action in Afghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaeda  continue to undermine progress toward  a more stable state.  Our military has done a heroic job in  Afghanistan. But success in Afghanistan also depends on  improving the  lives of the Afghan people—jobs, agriculture, stability, and a functional government.  We have not done enough to win the  hearts and minds of the Afghan people.  And the military cannot bear this burden alone.  The last time I went to Afghanistan  there were only six American agricultural experts for the entire country—I  think today there are only slightly  more.  For a nation with an agricultural  economy and record poppy harvest, we  have been able to lend just a handful of  agricultural development experts.  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  understands this critical need to partner our military efforts with civilian  development expertise. Last month he  said:  The problem is that the civil side of our  government—the Foreign Service and  foreign-policy side, including our aid for international development—[has] been systematically starved of resources for a quarter of a  century or more . . . We have not provided  the resources necessary, first of all, for our  diplomacy around the world; and second, for  communicating to the rest of the world what  we are about and who we are as a people.  Many people on both sides of the  aisle agree that USAID is no longer  equipped to do its job effectively. We  simply  are not meeting  the  international  development  goals  of  the  United States.  USAID has been shortchanged—and  America’s efforts abroad have suffered  as a result.  Now we have a lot of needs here at  home, to be sure. But one important  lesson of the  last  few years  is that  America must be engaged if we are to  remain a leader in world affairs.  The Increasing America’s Global Development Capacity Act of 2009 would  take the first step toward putting the  Agency for International Development  on firmer footing. As Secretary Clinton  said in her remarks to USAID employees last week, it is ironic that that our  very best young military leaders are  given unfettered resources to spend as  they see fit to build a school, to open a  health clinic, to pave a road, and our  diplomats  and  development  experts  have to go through miles of paperwork  to spend ten cents. Secretary Clinton  said, and I agree, that this is not a sensible approach.  The bill would authorize USAID to  hire an additional 700 Foreign Service  Officers this year. This would basically  double the current number of development officers available to work in targeted countries.  This is fundamental to rebuilding the  agency’s capacity.  Senator LEAHY, Chair of the Foreign  Operations  Appropriations  Subcommittee, shares a commitment to  rebuilding USAID. I am heartened by  the Subcommittee’s recommended increase  in  funding  for USAID’s operating expenses for fiscal year 2009. This  was a priority for me in the bill, and  Chairman LEAHY has been very supportive.  My bill also would establish a goal of  hiring an additional 1,300 Foreign Service Officers by 2012.  After three years, USAID would have  more than 3,000 talented, committed  Americans serving in the world’s most  difficult locations helping to improve  the lives of others. It won’t be the 5,000  experts of the 1960s, but it will be a big  improvement from today.  With a stronger development work  force, we can send talented public servants to help improve child and maternal health, treat people with AIDS, TB  and malaria, provide clean water and  sanitation, help  farmers and women  start or improve their business, and assist reformers and civic leaders to build  stronger democratic institutions.  We all recall the renewed interest in  public service that emerged after 9/11—  many of those people have answered  the call, and I bet there are as many  more who would welcome an opportunity to serve.  Foreign development assistance is as  important a foreign policy tool as diplomacy and defense.  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is  perhaps the most persuasive advocate  for rebuilding our civilian development  capacity. He argues that we need to engage in non-military ways to pursue  global development goals.  The civilian instruments of national  security—diplomacy, development assistance, sharing expertise on civil society—are becoming more and more  important.  Secretary Gates argues that these  tools are good for the world’s poor, our  national security, and our country.  I agree.  Let us take one concrete step to rebuild that important civilian capacity,  which would help improve our ability  to help the world’s poorest countries  and people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 355  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Increasing  America’s Global Development Capacity Act  of 2009’’.

123,2,2009-02-09,Mr. POMEROY.," Madam Speaker, last  month the employment of George W.  Bush came to an end. Unfortunately, so  did the jobs of nearly 600,000 Americans, hardworking men and women hit  in every sector of our economy, thrown  out of work in the toughest recession  to hit our Nation in decades.  The job losses of January show that  this is an accelerating recession. We  lost 1.7 million  jobs  in the  first 10  months of 2008, then almost 600,000 in  the month of November, again in December, again in January.  Look at this chart. This shows how  this recession compares to the other  two. No easing of job loss, no end in  sight.  We must pass a stimulus responding  to this crisis. This is the worst rate of  job loss ever recorded. We must help  Barack Obama, our new President, respond to this economic crisis  facing  our Nation.  f  MONEY FOR THE MOB MUSEUM  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
124,2,2009-02-09,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  as Americans worry about the economy, Washington is using the politics  of fear to promote a so-called stimulus  package. This $800 billion bill will cost  every man, woman, child and illegal in  the United States about $2,700. However, we’re told unless we pass this big  spending bill, we’re,  in essence, all  going to die.  The intimidating tactics used by the  proponents give money to special interest groups like museums, including, believe  it or not,  the Mob Museum.  That’s right. The Mayor of Las Vegas  correctly claims the bill allows for millions of dollars to go to funding the Las  Vegas show piece, the Mob Museum.  I wonder how the money for a high  dollar  edifice  to  glorify  organized  crime will help out our economy. Obviously,  the  government  should  not  strong-arm the taking of the people’s  money only to give it to this or to  other special interest groups.  Let the people keep more of their  own money. Cut taxes  for all those  that pay taxes. Then with more of  their own money, the people will decide how to stimulate the economy.  After all,  it  is their money. And  I  doubt they will be buying tickets to a  museum dedicated to organized crime.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  IN SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN  RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT  ACT  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2009
125,2,2009-02-09,Mrs.  CHRISTENSEN.,"  This  body  passed a very good recovery package.  It’s important to note, as we prepare to  go to conference, that most economists  have warned that  it would be a  far  greater risk to pass one that is too  small and that, therefore, it would be  better to take that risk on the side of  making the package a bigger one.  The increase in food stamps and unemployment benefits, the tax credits,  all begin to put money in the hands  where it’s needed. Robust State stabilization  funds  and  infrastructure  projects, green jobs, small business and  training provisions create and replace  the millions of jobs lost over the past 8  years. That’s the recovery part.  These and the education, health care,  broadband and renewable energy provisions are  the critical  reinvestments  and the important change that Americans voted for and want the President  and Congress to bring about.  We should keep much that the Senate put  in and keep our provisions,  even if it means a bill that may cost  $900 billion, because it would have the  dramatic impact our communities need  today and build the strong foundation  our Nation needs for the future.  The American people want and need  change. Let’s begin it with a robust  American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act.  f  U.S. DELEGATION SILENT AT UPR  OF THE WORLD’S WORST HUMAN  RIGHTS OFFENDERS  (Mr. WOLF asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
126,2,2009-02-09,Mr. WOLF.,"  The  United  Nations  Human Rights Council  is now conducting reviews of the human rights  record of 16 countries, among which are  China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Russia.  And I was shocked and, quite frankly,  disappointed to learn that the new administration has failed to fill its seat  and has washed its hands of even questioning  these  countries.  How  can  America be silent about  four of the  worst offenders of human rights and religious freedom around the world?  China has been designated by the  State Department’s annual Religious  Freedom report as a country of particular concern since 1999. No administration comments.  Saudi Arabia has received this designation,  too. Again, no  comments  from the new administration.  The U.S. Commission on Religious  Freedom placed Cuba on their watch  list. Again, no comment from this administration.  The administration made a pledge to  place human rights at the top of its  agenda, and yet they’re absent at this  very critical point. This is a bad start  for this administration in the area of  human rights and religious freedom.  MEDIA’S DOUBLE STANDARD ON  PARTY ID  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
127,2,2009-02-09,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Madam Speaker, breaking news. The national media  spells scandal without the ‘‘D.’’  Two weeks ago the Governor of Illinois was removed from office. All three  television networks ran full reports on  the story the same night and again the  following morning. Not  one  report  mentioned that he is a Democrat.  The same has been true of numerous  other Democrats recently embroiled in  scandal. CNN ignored the party affiliation of the Democratic Mayor of Baltimore as news broke that she had been  indicted. The AP did the same while  covering the indictment of the former  Democratic Mayor of Detroit. And in  the aftermath of his sex scandal, network newscasts apparently forgot that  the former Governor of New York is a  Democrat.  Americans need and deserve balanced  reporting from the media, not selective  omissions.  f  THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO  FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF  (Mr. REHBERG asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
128,2,2009-02-09,Mr. REHBERG.," In 1933, in the midst  of  the Great Depression, Franklin  Delano Roosevelt, elected on a platform of change, said in his inaugural  address, ‘‘The only thing we have to  fear is fear itself.’’  In 1961, another President, John F.  Kennedy,  elected  on  a  platform  of  change, said, ‘‘Let us never negotiate  out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.’’  I ask my friends from both parties to  heed this advice and reject the politics  of fear. Let’s not fear the negotiating  table. Let’s talk about meaningful bipartisan solutions that will benefit our  country and get people back to work.  As Kennedy continued, ‘‘United there  is little we cannot do, but divided there  is little we can do.’’  Let us work together because people  won’t remember how fast we fixed this  problem. They will, however, remember how well we fixed it.  f  GOVERNMENT SPENDING DOES  NOT FIX ECONOMIC PROBLEMS  (Mr. HERGER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
129,2,2009-02-09,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Speaker, to  paraphrase an old saying, those who  don’t learn from history are doomed to  make things worse. History shows us  that government spending does not fix  economic problems. If spending was the  key to a robust and sound economy,  the U.S. should be in a boom time.

As we speak, the deficit for the year  2009, fiscal 2009, is soaring to record  highs. CBO, the Congressional Budget  Office, our budget shop, which is neutral and nonpartisan, has recently projected that the deficit for 2009 will be  $1.2 trillion. And as high as this projection may be, our friends, it’s probably  a low-ball estimate.  It omits,  for example, the supplemental to pay for our deployment in  Afghanistan and Iraq, which will be  around $70 billion for the remainder of  this fiscal year; it assumes that the alternative minimum tax will stay in full  force and effect reaching 20 or so million-income tax payers for whom it was  never intended. This increases the revenues by $70 billion though AMT has,  in fact, been omitted year so that it  does not apply for middle-income taxpayers for whom it was not intended.  It also assumes that the tax cuts  passed in 2001 and 2003, despite the fact  that we have huge deficits, will expire  on December 31, 2010, and as provided  by the law which enacted them in the  first place.  When you add all of these into the  equation—the Bush  administration’s  last deficit, the deficit that we inherited  from President Bush and must  work our way out of—the deficit could  easily top $1.4 trillion. It staggers the  imagination.  These are deficits that happened on  the watch of the Bush administration  and under their fiscal policies. But we,  as Democrats, won the election, and it  is our responsibility to decide what  should we do about the deficits left us.  Unfortunately, we’ve got forces converging on the budget which make it  difficult to bring the deficit down to  realistic terms. For example, we have  the severest economic downturn in our  economy since at least the first or second world war ended. So we have the  mounting  costs  of  counter-cyclical  policies, TARP, the stimulus now pending in the Senate, the conservatorship  of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. All of  these things are hugely expensive. We  have the rising costs of major entitlements—Social  Security,  Medicare,  Medicaid—due to the retirement of the  baby boomers.  We have defense budgeted and funded  at historically high  levels and  sustained for an historically long period of  time. Funds  funded to  front-end accounts, accounts in the budget which  need to be funded adequately but are  not. Transportation is a good example.  It will exhaust its reserve early next  year and run close to zero unless we  can get funds back into that particular  account.  Of course, as always  there’s education, which is not funded as robustly  as many of us think it should be. And  of course there are new topics—alternative energies and various incentives  for increasing the energy supplies and  making  this  country  energy  independent.  b1645  Then we have the renewal of existing  tax cuts, which are slated to expire on  December 31, 2010.  When we add all of these things in, in  addition to the price commitments we  have to do something about the climate and something about universal  health care coverage, it becomes very,  very difficult to do anything to the  bottom line of the budget, despite the  fact that it is bigger than it has ever  been before in peace time.  The overarching question that faces  this whole country as we incur these  huge sums of debt is: How long will foreigners help us? How long will they  keep buying our Treasury debt?  We have, therefore, the worst budget  since World War II and the worst economy in which to work out the problems  of these budgets. Every recession has  its own pattern to it. But it is clear  that it is difficult in every recession,  any recession, to work out of the recession when you’re swimming upstream,  when the economy is working against  you; to work out of a budget deficit  when the economy is working against  you.  Let me show you some charts, those  who are listening. This is a simple bar  graph. It shows that the Bush administration, when he came to office, had a  phenomenal inheritance. A budgeting  surplus over the next 10 years by $5.6  trillion. That was January, 2001.  By January, 2004, that surplus of $236  billion was gone. Vanished. In 4 year’s  time, we went from a $236 billion surplus to a $412 billion deficit. This happened under the policies and the watch  of the Bush administration.  This next chart portrays out over  time the assets of this administration  and the previous administration. This  is the first George Bush administration. The first Mr. Bush. There was a  significant decline  in the budget at  that point in time. But, when the Clinton  administration  came  to  office,  President Clinton sent us a budget in  February of 1993, on February 22, the  first full significant action taken by  his  administration,  and  every year  after the adoption of that budget by  one vote in the House and one vote in  the Senate,  the bottom  line  is  the  budget got better and better and better, to point where we were at this  point right here, 1997, 1998, the year  2000.  The budget was, in those years, balanced for the first time in recent memory. Then, in 2001, the year 2000, we had  a surplus of $236 billion. The second Mr.  Bush came to office here. You can see  the bottom line got worse and worse  and worse until there was a slight pickup here. But, then in the out years 2004,  2005, 2006, 2007, the budget got worse  and worse and worse, until the point it  runs off the chart at the bottom of the  page. That is the deficit we are now  looking at, a deficit of as much as $1.4  trillion.  Now, that would be a concern under  any circumstances. But, in the present  situation, the deficits that we have incurred over  the  last  10 years have  largely been  funded and  financed by  foreigners. Japan, China, Great Britain, Europe, and Pacific Rim countries.  They have run trade surpluses with us  and used the surplus dollars they hold  to buy back our Treasury bills. It’s a  convenient  short-term  arrangement.  But, over the long term, it means foreigners own more and more of our debt,  and you find it hard to be totally independent as a country, certainly the  world super power, when you’re also  the world’s largest debtor.  As of 2008, the total amount of foreign-held Treasury securities had tripled under the Bush administration.  Starting out at $1 trillion, it rose to  $3.1  trillion—over  $2  trillion—during  the period 2001 to 2008. That is the accumulation of  foreign-held Treasury  bills and certificates.  As for the total debt of the United  States, this  is where we began—$5.7  trillion in 2001. That is where the total  debt of the United States stood when  Mr. Bush came to office. A substantial  sum. But every year that number went  up and up and up, to the point where,  when he left office a couple of weeks  ago, the amount of debt stood at $10.7  trillion. Nearly doubled in an 8-year period of time—from $5.7 trillion to $10.7  trillion. And, as a consequence of that,  we are feeling the effects of it in all  sectors of our economy.  Would the gentlelady from Massachusetts care to make a comment or a  statement? I gladly yield time to her.

145,37,2009-02-09,Mr. BAUCUS.," Madam President, this  afternoon the Senate returns to its 7th  day of work on this important jobs bill.  The case for this bill continues to grow  stronger every day. Last week, for example, we  learned  that  3.6 million  Americans have lost their jobs since  this recession began—3.6 million Americans have lost their jobs. The unemployment rate has risen to 7.6 percent  and it is rising. Job losses appear to be  accelerating.  Last year, more than 3 million families lost their homes to foreclosure—3  million families in 1 year—and many  more foreclosures appear to lie ahead.  We face the worst economic disaster  in  the  lifetimes of most Americans  alive today. History will judge how we  respond and let us not let this Nation  down.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, there  were  those who questioned vigorous  Government  response.  There  were  those who fretted about short-term deficit. We were spending too much, they  said. History has not  judged  them  kindly.  Rather, the consensus of economists  came to agree with the great British  economist,  John Maynard  Keynes.  Keynes argued that in times of high  and rising unemployment, the Government has an important job to do. The  Government must make up for lagging  demand in the private sector, he said,  and the Keynesian school teaches the  best way to increase demand is to get  money in the hands of those most likely to spend it quickly.  It  is  true  some  economists questioned the Keynesian consensus, but  those questioners are very much on the  fringe of economic thinking. The mainstream—by far the mainstream is that  we have to use public money to help  pull us out of recession.  Our time of testing is upon us. The  broad consensus of economic analysis  informs us what to do. The question before us is now one of political will. Will  this generation have the courage to  confront the economic storm of our  time or will this generation be like  that which preceded the New Deal?  Will our generation, by its inaction, be  found wanting or will our generation  rise to the challenge of our times?  The path to address this crisis lies  ahead of us today. At about 5:30 p.m.  this evening this Senate will conduct a  rollcall vote on the motion to invoke  cloture  on  the  Collins-Nelson  substitute. That  substitute  is  the best  clear chance for the Nation to respond  to the economic crisis we face.  Under the previous order, if the Senate invokes cloture on the amendment,  then the Senate will be able to complete action on this bill with a vote at  12 noon tomorrow. If a Senator raises a  budget  point  of  order  against  the  amendment, then the Senate will vote  tomorrow on a motion to waive that  point of order; otherwise, under the  previous order,  the adoption of  the  amendment will still be subject to a 60-  vote threshold, and the Senate would  then vote on passage of the bill. Either  way, the Senate faces two 60-vote hurdles for this important legislation, one  this evening at 5:30 and another tomorrow at noon.  That familiar arithmetic dictates the  path before us. The amendment before  us provides the one clear chance to surmount that 60-vote hurdle. The Collins-  Nelson substitute provides an opportunity for Congress to respond and respond quickly,  swiftly. Let us  take  that opportunity.  The Collins-Nelson  substitute  is a  principled compromise. Yes, if I had  my way, I would have written it differently. I brought a slightly different  bill to the floor on behalf of the Finance Committee. But the substitute  makes the change we need so as to  allow the broad consensus we need to  pass this bill.  In the Collins-Nelson  substitute, we agreed to trim the underlying bill. But  I am pleased the  compromise  does  not  sacrifice  the  main thrust of the bill.  So what is the compromise? The Collins-Nelson substitute would trim the  COBRA  subsidy—that  is  the health  subsidy for persons who lose their jobs  and therefore lose their health insurance. It would provide a 50-percent subsidy for 12 months for the purchase of  health insurance for those who have  lost their jobs. This saves $5 billion.  The agreement trims the health information technology proposal. It would  cap the amount of funds that a critical  access hospital can receive under the  health IT provisions at 1.5 million per  hospital. This change saves $5 million  per hospital.  The Collins-Nelson  substitute also  cuts back on some of the tax incentives. The agreement eliminates the  general  credit  carry-back  provision,  saving about $9 billion.  The agreement trims the recovery  zone bonds by providing $10 billion in  private activity bonds and $5 billion in  refundable credit bonds. The agreement  provides a  35-percent  tax credit  for  Build America bonds for 2009 and 2010,  with a 40 percent tax credit for small  issuers. This change saves $2 billion.  The Collins-Nelson substitute trims  the number of people eligible for the  make work pay credit by beginning the  phase out of the credit at $70,000 in annual income for singles and at $140,000  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:34 Feb 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09FE6.005 S09FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
146,51,2009-02-09,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Madam President,  I thank the Senator from South Dakota  for his effective  leadership  in  helping  the American people understand the full implications of this legislation on American families. I ask  that  I be  informed when  I have  1  minute remaining.  A number of things have been said  about the so-called stimulus package,  which I feel, many of us feel, is more of  a spending bill than a stimulus bill.  But there is no doubt about the fact  that it increases our national debt.  The debt is not some abstract thing.  Our national debt is $10.7 trillion. This  adds  to  the national debt as much  money as—well, let’s put it this way. It  took from the beginning of the Republic until 1982 to have a cumulative debt  of $850 billion. And this bill is more  than that. This is a lot of money. We  are adding the $820 or 830 billion that  we have heard about plus the interest  over the next 10 years. That adds about  $10,000 to each family’s share of the  debt. Well, with that $10,000 you can  pay in-state tuition for 1.5 years at the  University of Tennessee. You could pay  for 21 years of public school lunches  every  day  for  the  average middle  school student. You could buy a gallon  of milk a week for 57 years. That is a  lot of money.  I wish to make three points today as  we  think  about  this  stimulus  bill  which, I believe, is more of a spending  bill. First, this bill makes a number of  policy decisions on education, health,  and energy that ought not to be made  in such a bill, but ought to be separately debated and considered.  No. 2, we should have all of the proposed  spending  on  the  table. Mr.  Geithner is coming up to Congress this  week to tell us how much we need for  banks. Then we need more for housing.  Then we need more for the war. I think  if we knew all of the money we are  about to have to borrow, our appetite  for spending $1.2 trillion, mostly on  projects that do not create jobs in the  next few months, would diminish.  And, third, this is not the kind of bipartisanship that I expected. As I listened to the President, I thought he  wanted to change the way Washington  works. The way Washington works in a  bipartisan way is for us to sit down and  talk with one another and come up  with something both Republicans and  Democrats can agree upon; not we won  the election, we will write the bill and  let’s see if we can pick off two or three  Senators.  First, a number of policy decisions.  The first version of the Senate bill actually doubled Federal  spending  for  education without any discussion.  I  used to be the Secretary of Education.  Today, that Department has about a  $68 billion budget. The original version  of the Senate bill doubles that. It took  40 years to get to $68 billion. But the  original Senate  bill would  increase  education spending by $140 billion over  the next two years—on top of that $68  billion we’re already spending per year.  So the bill would double the $68 billion  this year, and keep  it doubled next  year. Then it is supposed to go back  down to $68 billion the year after that,  which seems unlikely.  But there was no discussion about  this. Would you not think, if they were  going to double the Federal commitment to education, we would have a  discussion about what would be best to  spend  it on? I mean, are we so delighted with the performance in kindergarten through the 12th grade and  our preschool programs that we have  nothing to do but say, let’s double the  money for more of the same?  Even  the  small  things  that have  crept  into  the  legislation,  some of  which President Obama has said he  supports, should be fully debated. For  example, we have some new Senators  at the forefront of federal support for  the Teacher Incentive Fund. We have a  new Secretary of Education who supports this effort to help reward outstanding  teaching  and  outstanding  school leading, but not a penny was included in the Senate bill.  What about charter schools? A lot of  us on both sides of the aisle want to  give teachers the freedom to use their  own common sense and good judgment  in dealing with the children who are  brought to them. That is what a public  charter school does. Not a penny in the  Senate bill.  So education is the first policy area  that should have been debated separately. Then on health care, the House  added nearly $90 billion for Medicaid.  The President has  said we need  to  make health care available to every  American. We Republicans agree with  that. So we are ready to have a debate  about that. That will cost some money.  One of the major proposals, in fact,  the one that has the most bipartisan  support,  the Wyden-Bennett  legislation, would get rid of the Medicaid Program and replace it with individual accounts. This preempts that decision by  giving $90 billion more to the States.  So the States get $90 billion. That is  a lot of money. Tennessee’s share of  that would be $1.5 or $2 billion. That is  going to make the program so rich the  States will not want to give it up, and  we will not be able to have a full discussion about health care when that  comes around.  Then an energy bill. Last year,  I  asked the Energy Information Administration to estimate what kind of subsidies we were doing for renewable energy, because it seemed to me it was  all going to wind and nothing else. I  was about right.  EIA said: We are subsidizing wind at  27 times greater than all other forms of  renewable energy per kilowatt hour; 53  times greater than subsidies for coal  per kilowatt hour; and 15 times greater  than the subsidy  for nuclear, which  produces 70 percent of our carbon-free  electricity.  That was in the middle of last year.  That was at a time when we only were  committed to $11.5 billion to give to  rich people and big banks, some of  which we are bailing out, that get big  tax credits when they build wind turbines. So that was $11.5 billion in the  middle of last year.  Then  in October of  last year we  passed legislation that brought that up  to $16 billion over the next 10 years,  and this bill brings to $25.7 billion the  amount of taxpayer dollars that we are  paying rich people and banks so they  can get big tax credits  for building  wind turbines.  As far as the beautiful mountains of  North Carolina and Tennessee, I don’t  want those things littering our area,  particularly because the wind doesn’t  blow there enough to make it efficient.  But even in areas where it does make  sense, do we really need, without any  discussion, to go from $11.5 billion last  year to $26 billion this year with a national windmill policy? Why don’t we  have a debate about energy, and let’s  have a technology-neutral way to encourage all forms of renewable energy,  especially emerging forms.  We have an education bill, a health  care bill, and an energy bill, but we  don’t  have  a  stimulus  bill.  We  shouldn’t have all this on the table.  Mr. Geithner has apparently delayed  his recommendation about what we do  about credit and banks until we have  had the vote on this stimulus bill. This  was supposed to be a transparent administration. To be transparent, let’s  put it all out there. How much do we  need to appropriate for banks? I voted  for that twice now. I might vote for it  again if I think we need to do it. It was  not an easy vote, but I did it. How  much do we need to spend on housing?  How much do we need to spend on the  war in Afghanistan and to finish the  war in Iraq? How much do we need to  spend on  the health care plan  the  President and we in Congress have said  we want to work on? And how will we  shape all this into some control of entitlement spending? It would be nice if  we had it all on the table.  If we knew, as the testimony suggested before the Budget Committee  last week, that we really need to appropriate $400 or $500 or $600 billion to  take care of $2 trillion of toxic assets  in banks to get the economy moving  again, we might have less appetite for  lumping an energy bill and an education bill and a health care bill and a  lot of projects that don’t really stimulate the economy in with this borrowed  money.  Finally, on this side of the aisle, just  as on that side of the aisle, we like the  new President. He was our colleague.  He came to see us. We walked out of  that meeting between the President  and Republican Senators saying: Here  is an accomplished man who wants to  help our country. We want him to succeed because if he does our country will  succeed. But we want to be a part of it.  We expected to be a part of it.

147,58,2009-02-09,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President,  today I want to talk about some of the  questionable spending in this bill and  some of the amendments that we aren’t  going to be voting on.  First of all, there is $87 billion in  Medicaid funds in this bill.  That is a huge payment to the states.  And as I have said on this floor several times, it is more than States need  to pay for enrollment-driven increases  in Medicaid spending due to the recession.  I explained last week how the facts  show that this amount is far more than  States need for the cost of new Medicaid enrollment  resulting  from  the  economy.  What the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office  determined was  that  what States need to pay for increases  in Medicaid enrollment is not $87 billion but $10.8 billion. That is about $76  billion less than what this stimulus bill  gives the States.  So the question is, why does this bill  provide almost eight times what the  states actually need for the new enrollment resulting from the downturn?  Let’s not kid ourselves; this bill gives  States a slush fund. This outlandish  sum of money is not needed for Medicaid.  It is a slush fund for the States.  I thought that money should be spent  fairly. I thought there should be some  accountability.  On Friday night, I had an amendment  to  insure  the Medicaid  funds  would have been distributed fairly.  Amazingly, 17 Members of the Senate  voted to give their States less money.  But at least in that case, I was able  to get a vote.  I had several other amendments that  were never allowed to be made pending.  All day Wednesday, we were prevented from making amendments pending.  Retreats and signing ceremonies got  in the way.  Thursday  evening, we  spent more  time arguing over which amendments  would be made pending rather than actually processing amendments.  At 10 o’clock Friday morning, we  were encouraged to bring our amendments to the floor so they could be debated.  For some reason, the  first amendment was not allowed until 41⁄2hours  later.  I am disappointed that several of my  amendments will not receive a vote.  I am not convinced  the majority  wanted to have open debate and take  votes on many of my amendments.  It is too bad, because this bill still  needs fixing.  Congress is giving States $87 billion  and just resting on hope that States  don’t strip the health care safety net  for low income families and then pocket the money.  I use the word ‘‘hope’’ because the  underlying bill doesn’t do enough to  make sure States do what is best for  the Medicaid Program.  Does the bill prevent States  cutting their Medicaid programs?  It does not.  The bill only prevents States from  cutting Medicaid income eligibility.  But if Congress is giving States $87  billion and telling them not to cut  Medicaid  eligibility,  shouldn’t  Congress also tell States they can’t cut  benefits?  If Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling them not to cut Medicaid  eligibility,  shouldn’t Congress  also tell States they can’t cut payments to providers?  States  can’t  change  income  eligibility, but under the bill as written,  they can cut provider payments or benefits to providers.  Will there be Medicaid beneficiaries  who are elderly or disabled able to receive home and community based services?  If we want to keep seniors and the  disabled in their homes, rather than institutions, paying direct care workers  to provide home and community based  services is critical.  Will  there be enough pharmacists  taking Medicaid?  Will there be enough rural hospitals  or public hospitals taking Medicaid?  Will  there  be  enough  community  health centers taking Medicaid?  Will Medicaid beneficiaries who are  elderly or disabled be able to get into  nursing homes?  from  Will States cut mental health services because Congress didn’t prevent  them from doing so in this bill?  Will there be pediatricians or children’s hospitals there for children on  Medicaid?  If the Senate does nothing to protect  access to these vital providers, nobody  will be able to assure the people who  count on Medicaid that the care they  need will be there for them.  I filed an amendment that prevents  States  from generally cutting eligibility and benefits and provider payment rates while they are receiving the  $87 billion in additional aid.  Members could have voted to really  protect Medicaid.  That should have had a vote.  As written, the bill gives states $87  billion also  in the hope that States  don’t take actions that are contrary to  economic growth.  I use the word ‘‘hope’’ because the  bill doesn’t do enough to make sure  States do what is best for our economy  either.  We should ask for more guarantees  that States will spend the money appropriately and not make decisions  that work against economic recovery.  If Congress gives states $87 billion  and tells them not to cut Medicaid,  should Congress also tell States not to  raise taxes?  If states react to their deficits by increasing taxes, they will defeat the  goal of economic recovery.  It makes no sense for us to leave the  door wide open for States to raise taxes  while getting an $87 billion windfall  from the Federal Government.  I filed an amendment that prevents  States from raising income, personal  property or sales taxes as a condition  of the receipt of $87 billion in federal  assistance.  That should have had a vote.  If Congress gives states $87 billion  and tells them not to cut Medicaid,  should Congress also tell States not to  raise tuition at State universities?  If States can price young people out  of an education, that does nothing for  preparing our workforce for the 21st  century.  I filed an amendment that prevents  States  from raising tuition rates at  State colleges and universities as a  condition of the receipt of $87 billion in  Federal assistance.  That should have had a vote.  For $87 billion, what does this bill do  to ensure that all those Federal taxpayer dollars are being spent appropriately?  Almost nothing.  Senator  and  I  filed  an  amendment that requires States to do  something  to  improve  their waste,  fraud and abuse in exchange for the $87  billion in Federal taxpayer’s money.  It provides a list of eight options to  combat waste, fraud and abuse, and the  Secretary can provide more options as  well.  These are all very reasonable steps  States could and should take if Congress is going to send them 87 billion in  additional Medicaid dollars.

161,65,2009-02-09,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Madam  President, I rise today to take action—  and I thank my friend and colleague  from Montana for this opportunity to  speak—for action is what is demanded  by this American—and, indeed, global—economic crisis.  The  economic  recovery  bill  that  came over from the House was a start,  and the bill introduced in the Senate  was better, but it was not good enough,  and some elements did not seem to belong in a bill to create new jobs, save  the jobs people have now, and return  our economy to prosperity as soon as  possible. That is why Senator SUSAN  COLLINSand I worked with a group of  nearly a dozen and a half Senators—12  Democrats and 6 Republicans—to cut  and tailor our bipartisan compromise.  It focuses like a laser beam on tax cuts  for the middle class and job creation  for millions of Americans.  Critics have gone to great lengths to  find fault. That is the old Washington  way that leads straight down the path  to partisan bickering, deadlock, and a  dead end. Many have said it spends too  much. Others have said  it cuts too  much spending. That is a sign, to me,  that perhaps we have  it  just about  right.  We cut $110 billion of inefficient or  less stimulative spending out of the  previous  bill. As  I  say, we  have  trimmed the fat, fried the bacon, and  milked the sacred cows. We didn’t have  a closed-door negotiating system last  week as some have said. It was open to  all Senators, and they were invited. All  were welcome to participate. In fact,  several Republican colleagues did join  us and participated, although they declined to support our final proposal.  But they helped shape  it, and their  contributions were  listened to, were  considered, and were valuable.  Now, some critics also say that other  approaches might have been better for  the economy  than what we put  in  place. But no other plan has enough bipartisan support—and that is what you  have to have in the Senate—to get the  60 votes needed to pass. The time for  talk is over, and it is time to act.  I believe our plan is the best chance  for Congress to stop an economic avalanche. In just a year’s time, that avalanche has swept away jobs for 3.6 million Americans—including many in my  State of Nebraska—and nearly half nationwide vanished in the last 3 months.  That is three and a half million jobs  lost in the last 12 months and almost  half of them in the last 3 months. The  avalanche has erased billions of dollars  in  assets,  driven  anxiety  up,  and  pushed our economy down toward the  worst condition in seven decades. And  it is accelerating. People in Nebraska  and across America are  losing their  homes every day. The cost of inaction  would be far higher than the cost of  this bill, and acting later, when we are  in a deeper recession or depression, will  cost even more.  Other critics of the bipartisan plan  also say we are creating too much debt  to leave to our children. I am afraid  they have not learned from the past.  The surest way to get out of debt is the  way we have before: economic growth.  Let’s review. In 1993, when President  Clinton inherited a deficit of over $300  billion, we grew our way out of it with  tax cuts and jobs that lowered unemployment, increased productivity, and  increased revenues. With the help of  the Congress, he turned that deficit  into a  surplus of over  $200 billion.  President Obama has inherited a deficit of at least half a trillion dollars,  and now we must once again restart  the American prosperity engine with a  lean diet of tax cuts and jobs for the  middle class. This is not only the fastest plan to get us out of this economic  slide; indeed, it is the only thing that  ever has.  While it certainly is easier to stay on  the sidelines, it is our responsibility, as  Members of Congress, to the American  citizens and taxpayers to approve a recovery plan that is tailored, targeted,  and  lean, one that reduces taxes so  middle-class Americans  can  get  by  today and that creates American jobs  so we can grow our way out of this crisis.  Some say we have cut too much from  important programs, such as help for  struggling States. We did reduce spending by $40 billion, leaving $39 billion,  because we didn’t want to offer a taxpayer-backed blank check to States  with little accountability or promise of  job  creation. The  plan  leaves  unchanged  $87 billion  to States under  Medicaid. Now, let’s be clear. The cuts  our group found are reductions in new  spending and not actual cuts.  The more than $300 billion in tax cuts  will help families with children, college  students,  home  buyers,  commuters,  and businesses. They also offer incentives to expand renewable energy and  promote  energy  efficiency.  Cutting  taxes has always been a key way Government can drive private sector job  and economic growth, and  the economic recovery plan we will consider  delivers those major tax cuts.  The $110 billion leaner spending side  of the plan will fuel, save, and create  jobs  in towns, townships, and cities  across America. It still provides robust  support for infrastructure projects that  will fix and build roads, bridges, highways, and sewer systems. It will improve community health centers, refurbish  childcare  centers,  expand  broadband Internet service, and repair  housing. It will create the smart grid  for electricity transmission across our  country. Those upgrades will leave a  lasting legacy long beyond the terms of  the legislation.  Our  refocused  bipartisan  proposal  isn’t perfect. We all will admit that.  But it will, in my view, do the job we  need right now, and it will get many  Americans back on the job while keeping many others in their jobs.  I would like to extend my gratitude  to Senator SUSANCOLLINS from Maine,  Senator OLYMPIASNOWE from Maine,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:59 Feb 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A09FE6.013 S09FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
162,72,2009-02-09,Mr. ISAKSON.," Madam President, I  wish today to honor in the RECORDof  the Senate MAJ Shelia Flowers of the  U.S. Army Reserve on the eve of her  promotion to the rank of lieutenant  colonel.  Although Major Flowers was born  and raised in North Carolina, her dedication to her country has ultimately  lead her to call the State of Georgia  her home as her parent command is the  U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters in Ft. McPherson, GA.  Major Flowers was mobilized in support of Operation Noble Eagle in 2003  and has spent the last 6 years on Active  Duty. In addition to her other tours,  Major Flowers deployed in support of  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  in  2006.  Throughout her Active Duty period,  she has served in the G–1 Directorate  in support of Operation Noble Eagle.  Additionally, Major Flowers was assigned to directly support Operation  Enduring Freedom in November 2007.  In keeping with one of the tenets  that sustains the Reserve Component,  Major Flowers is dedicated to improving her community and the primary  means through which she achieves this  goal is by her membership in the Alpha  Kappa Alpha Sorority, an organization  that recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of its establishment.  In addition  to her  service  to her  country and community, Major Flowers is dedicated to her family. Her husband, LTC Eric Flowers,  shares his  wife’s sense of duty and is currently deployed to the Horn of Africa. Their  daughter, Cheyenne, currently resides  in Atlanta.  I congratulate MAJ Shelia Flowers  for her hard work and much-deserved  promotion to lieutenant colonel, and I  extend to her my sincere gratitude for  her dedication to the defense of our Nation.∑  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting a withdrawal and  sundry nominations which were  referred to the appropriate committees.

163,79,2009-02-09,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, if my  colleague will yield for a moment, I  want to mention as we close, I am so  happy and excited about  the President’s nominee for the Small Business  Administration. I had the opportunity  to meet her for the first time today.  I ask my colleague from Maine, who  is actually very  familiar with  this  nominee, and she is from Maine, if the  Senator would share a word or two  about the particular qualifications of  this nominee as we get ready to start  this process. Through the Chair to my  friend from Maine, it is indicative of  the President’s focus and his interest  and his understanding by giving us  such a quality nominee to consider.  ",2009
164,79,2009-02-09,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Maine.  ,2009
165,79,2009-02-09,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I appreciate that Senator LANDRIEUhas raised  for discussion the tremendous credentials that are offered by Karen Mills.  There is no question that she has a tremendous background both in manufacturing and venture capitalism and in  understanding the role that small businesses play in our Nation’s economy.  She has had firsthand experience, not  only through her family’s business endeavors, but also through her work in  venture capitalism in helping to shape  and rebuild various businesses. She understands  and  appreciates  the  resources that are necessary and essential to rebuilding businesses and the  access to capital that is required.  Also, she played a pivotal role  in  Maine’s economy, in encouraging the  use of cluster development. She has  worked extensively with the Brookings  Institute on how to nurture cluster development in various small and rural  communities, to help rebuild and reshape their local economies.  What we have recognized, and what  she has certainly demonstrated time  and again through her own personal  firsthand experience, is that it does not  take a lot of resources to nurture and  create small businesses as a foundation  for a local economy. It is that type of  experience she will bring to the Small  Business Administration.  In  fact,  I had the opportunity to  meet with her this afternoon as she  prepares for the confirmation hearing.  There is no question that she has widespread knowledge on what it will take  to rebuild the Small Business Administration helping it to be far more responsive and receptive to small businesses, to understand what they need,  to link them up with lenders, to provide the technology required to make  the agency much more effective and responsive to the needs of small businesses across the country.  I am  looking  forward  to working  with Ms. Mills and the chair of the  Small Business Committee because I  believe that Ms. Mills is outstanding in  her capabilities and truly appreciates  the role small businesses play in America’s economy. Mr. President,  I ask  unanimous consent  to have a biography  of Ms. Mills  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  BIOGRAPHYOFMS. KARENGORDONMILLS  Ms. Karen Gordon Mills is the President of  MMP Group, Inc. Previously, she was the Co-  Founder and Managing Director at Solera  Capital. Before  founding MMP Group, she  was the Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Industrial Group for E.S.  Jacobs and Co., from December 1983 to January 1993. In this role, Ms. Mills personally led  seven leveraged buyout transactions and had  an influential or board role in six others: Ms.  Mills background  includes  consulting  for  McKinsey and Co. both in the U.S. and in Europe, and working as a Product Manager for  General Foods. She has been a Director and  Member of Audit and Compensation Committees of Arrow Electronics Inc. since 1994 and  Director and Member of its Audit Committee  of ArmorAll Products Inc. since 1994. Ms.  Mills serves as Director of Latina Media  Ventures LLC, Triangle Pacific Corp. since  1988, Annie’s Homegrown Inc., Scotts Company, and Guardian Insurance Company. Ms.  Mills chairs Governor Baldacci’s Council on  Competitiveness and the Economy. She also  sits on the Governor’s Council for the Redevelopment of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, which recently went on the BRAC closure list, and serves on the Boards of the  Maine Technology Institute and the Maine  Nature Conservancy. Ms. Mills is a member  of the Council on Foreign Relations and has  been Vice Chairman of the Harvard Overseers. Ms. Mills has an A.B. in Economics  from Radcliffe College, Magna Cum Laude.  She also holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School where she was a Baker Scholar.  ",2009
166,79,2009-02-09,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator for her testimony in  regard to Karen Mills and will commit  as the new chair of this committee to  move her nomination through with dispatch.  I will say before I give closing remarks, a word to banks and credit  unions, particularly community banks,  that I am intent in a leadership position on this committee to have the  SBA be a better partner to community  banks and credit unions as we really leverage the power of the SBA. Too often  in the past, it has been seen as a problem or too complicated or too bureaucratic. I am looking forward to making  that a much smoother, more powerful,  muscular partnership so that our small  businesses  in America  can  have  a  model, the best in the world. It is going  to be exciting to work on.  I thank the Senator from Maine and  look forward to having a very strong  partnership with her  in the months  ahead.  Is there any further business?  ",2009
167,79,2009-02-09,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, one other  issue that is critical, which Senator  LANDRIEUand I both share, is that of  elevating the Small Business Administration to Cabinet-level status. As I  have said before, this will underscore  the critical role that small businesses  play  in our economy. I know Chair  LANDRIEUshares and supports such an  initiative. It is long overdue and unquestionably should be done. We should  elevate the status of the agency to give  it the prominence and profile it deserves on behalf of the men and women  of our Nation’s small business community. There should be far more focus  upon the role that they can serve in  not only our domestic marketplace,  but the global marketplace as well.  I will continue to call for the elevation of this critical position. I have  advocated  it  for years.  In  light of  where we are today in the economy,  and the increase in unemployment, it  is even more imperative that we increase the prominence of small businesses in the President’s cabinet because, again, doing so will provide the  attention and resources they require to  survive and be prosperous.  ",2009
168,79,2009-02-09,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  I  agree with the Senator from Maine. I  was happy to join with her in a letter  to the President urging him to take  this step. Hopefully, he will consider  that request and give it every consideration.

169,86,2009-02-09,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and legacy of Richard Sklar  . . . Ambassador, engineer, business leader,  innovator, dispute mediator, professor, negotiator’s negotiator, civic leader and public servant, winemaker, NFL  fan,  loyal  friend  to so  many and most importantly, exceedingly proud  husband, father and grandfather.  Dick Sklar passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 74 on January 20, 2009, at  his home in San Francisco after watching with  great  satisfaction President Obama’s  Inauguration with his beloved wife Barbara by his  side. Touchingly, his hometown newspaper,  the San Francisco Chronicle noted, ‘‘his death  came  the day after he received  the highest  noncitizen medal of honor from the Republic  of Montenegro, for his role in helping the new  country achieve independence.’’  Dick  is survived by his wife Barbara, his  daughters Pamela Ball  of San Francisco,  Karen Wong King of Santa Rosa, sons Mark  Sklar of Phoenix and Eric Sklar of St. Helena,  eight beautiful grandchildren, son–in–law John  Ball and daughters–in–law Erica and Marilyn  Sklar. Dick was born on November 18, 1943  in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was an engineer and his  family moved often while he  was a young man. He was a graduate of Cornell University earning both a Bachelor’s and  Master’s Degrees in Engineering.  After serving  in  the United States Army,  Dick founded and sold his first business, Allied  Steel and Tractor Corporation, a Cleveland  Ohio based manufacturing company. Cleveland is where he met the love of his life Barbara who is recognized in her own right as a  brilliant artist and a civic leader.  Dick Sklar was a  friend and a mentor  to  many in public service, from Mayors to Governors to Members of Congress to Presidents.  In 1976, Mayor Moscone recruited him to San  Francisco  to oversee  the $1.5 billion sewer  and wastewater treatment plant program and  the  Yerba  Buena Center  known  as  the  Moscone Center. At the time Dick began his  service to the City, it was under a building ban  for non–performance. Senator FEINSTEIN (then  Mayor of San Francisco) appointed him  to  head the Public Utilities Commission. He was  exceptionally successful in these projects and  became known world wide as a leader who  was pragmatic and fair, and who set aside bureaucratic nonsense, challenging those around  him  to  think practically and strive  for excellence and  innovation  in everything  they did.  Dick’s projects consistently came  in under  budget and ahead of schedule.  From 1983 to 1996, Dick served as President of O’Brien Kreitzberg and Associates  (OKA). He developed the first integrated program management system now used industry-  wide to track spending, measure progress and  improve accountability on public construction  projects. During his tenure with OKA, the company built ten airports, light rail lines in major  cities in the U.S. and facilities for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.  In 1996, President Clinton wisely turned to  Dick Sklar for help and appointed him first as  Special Representative  to  the President  in  Bosnia after  the Dayton Peace Accords. He  then appointed him an Ambassador  to  the  United Nations from 1997 to 1999 and lastly  as Special Representative of the President for  the Southeast Europe Initiative from 1999 to  2001. Dick led the postwar economic recovery  effort in the Balkans in coordination with the  World Bank, International Monetary Fund and  the European Union,  focusing on  industries  critical  to establishing a market economy  to  encourage investment.  After five years in Europe, Dick and Barbara  came home to the Bay Area in 2001 and this  time it was the Governor of California, Gray  Davis, who needed his expertise to help with  California’s energy crisis. Dick expedited construction of new power–generating  facilities  and helped keep the lights on for California. In  recent years he consulted with transportation,  engineering and construction  firms  in California and served as an advisor to the Prime  Minister of Montenegro.  Dick Sklar was also known for his love of  fine foods. He knew the menus of great restaurants around the world and could turn out  great culinary delights out of his own kitchen.  Scores of  friends dined at his  table  in San  Francisco, at his beloved home in the vineyard  in Rutherford and at  tables of  restaurants  around the world.  Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of  Representatives to join me in honoring the extraordinary life and accomplishments of Richard Sklar and extend our sympathy to the family he loved so much. His decades of contributions to his community and his country stand  as  lasting  legacies of a  life  lived well. How  privileged I am to have known this magnificent  man and to have had him as one of my dearest friends. He made our world better by contributing  to  it  in unique ways with an unmatched passion for justice, integrity and decency. Those of us who knew him and loved  him will miss him deeply all the days of our  lives, and his life instructs each of us on what  it means to be a true patriot.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

171,86,2009-02-09,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Mr. Adam Taliaferro, who grew  up in Voorhees, NJ, for receiving the 2009 Humanitarian Award given by  the Philadelphia  Sports Writers Association. Mr. Taliaferro received this award in recognition of his work in  creating  the  Adam  Taliaferro  Foundation,  which helps athletes who,  like Adam, have  suffered spinal cord injuries. His foundation offers financial, emotional and educational support to student-athletes who experience head  or spinal injuries.  While making a tackle in the fourth quarter  of a game at Ohio State on September 23,  2000, Mr. Taliaferro suffered a severe neck injury. His fifth cervical vertebra, located at the  base of his neck, was fractured and doctors  warned Adam and his  family  that he  likely  would never be able  to walk again. Despite  this dire prognosis, Adam regained the ability  to walk only five months after the injury. Mr.  Taliaferro has used his experience  to  touch  the lives of others who have suffered similar  injuries. He spends time personally responding  to e-mail and phone calls from individuals who  have life-altering disabilities. His encouraging  words,  from someone who knows  from personal experience what it feels like to be seriously injured, mean the world to those on the  other end of the line.  Madam  Speaker,  since  the  injury Mr.  Taliaferro has received his undergraduate degree from Penn State and his JD from Rutgers  School of Law-Camden. He has also created  the Adam Taliaferro Foundation which plays a  vital role in the community, helping those with  serious injuries. Mr. Taliaferro is an excellent  role-model for every American. His ability to  use adversity as the impetus for such a positive contribution  is an example  for us all.  I  congratulate Mr. Taliaferro  for  receiving  the  Humanitarian Award and wish him the best of  luck in his future endeavors.  f  MILLARD FULLER  HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

They are  currently  sending  robo-calls into my district criticizing  me for my vote on the stimulus package. Well, maybe that’s fair game.  But last week I was home in the district and I accepted an invitation by a  bipartisan group, the Public Policy Institute of California, to discuss the  issue. Three Members of the other side  of the aisle in my area were invited to  be on that panel. They all declined, including one who had accepted and then  declined when  she  found out  I was  going to be there.  You’re messing with my children and  my  grandchildren’s  future.

177,2,2009-02-23,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, we have  some young people here on the floor  with us  today,  and  they  represent  American families who are hurting and  need relief. But, instead, Washington  continues to engage in out-of-control  spending.  There was the $1 trillion ‘‘stimulus  plan’’ that will only stimulate more  government  and more  debt. We’re  about to deal with a half trillion dollar  omnibus spending bill to fund the government for just 7 months, which is an  8 percent  increase  in spending. And  then we have the $75 billion for the  President’s mortgage bailout proposal.  And then he’s going to present to us a  way to cut the deficit, which is going  to be on the backs of our troops. He’s  going to cut spending for our troops.  We need to remind the American people that the number one role of the  Federal Government is the defense of  this Nation. And we need people to understand  that we are putting  these  children,  their  children  and  their  grandchildren into great debt because  Washington will not face up to its responsibility.  f  HONORING LARRY H. MILLER  (Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
178,2,2009-02-23,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, this  week the people of Utah mourned the  passing of a beloved community leader,  entrepreneur and philanthropist. Larry  H. Miller’s life is an inspiration to all  of us who care about families, our communities and our country.  Larry Miller was an extraordinary  businessman, building more  than  80  companies, including his auto business  from one dealership in 1979 to 39 today.  His business holdings expanded with  the 1985 purchase of the Utah Jazz and  later the Salt Lake Bees and the creation of the Miller Motorsports Park.  Perhaps more  important  than his  business  success was his  charitable  work, much of it unseen and anonymous. Through his Larry H. Miller  Charities, Miller provided  for  thousands, funded campus sports facilities,  and established a training center for  entrepreneurs, as well as a facility for  public safety training.  Larry H. Miller had a profound impact upon the State of Utah, and his  works will continue to be a positive  force in countless lives. I honor his accomplishments, his example, his philanthropy, and wish nothing but the  best for his family, and hope they understand  the  deep  gratitude  Utah  shares for a truly honorable man.  STIMULUS GIVES JOBS TO LAW-  BREAKERS  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
179,2,2009-02-23,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the so-called stimulus bill gives jobs to  law-breakers.  Democrats put illegal workers ahead  of Americans without jobs. They removed a requirement that employers  verify the legal status of workers paid  with stimulus money. So now we have  taxpayers’ dollars going to hire illegal  immigrants instead of U.S. citizens and  legal workers.  Now that the requirement that employers hire legal workers has been removed,  300,000  jobs  in  construction  alone will go to illegal workers, according to the Heritage Foundation. If  the goal of the stimulus bill is to create jobs, is it too much to ask that the  jobs go to citizens and legal workers?  The American people need to know  that the Democrats could have saved  stimulus  jobs  for citizens but  intentionally decided to give jobs to illegal  immigrants instead.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2009

186,16,2009-02-23,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr. Speaker, if today someone says  the  word  ‘‘Geronimo,’’  it  evokes  thoughts of an icon of popular culture.  It is unfortunate that in the reality of  this Apache warrior’s  life and death  there is not more interest of the importance for him than simply the pop culture that was developed during World  War II.  It was in fact in 1940, the night before  the first mass jump, that paratroopers  at Fort Benning were watching a 1939  movie named, oddly enough,  ‘‘Geronimo,’’ in which the actor playing this  hero yells his name as he leaps from a  cliff into a river. Thus was born the  phrase that has become known to more  people than the actual life of the Native American leader we call Geronimo.  This resolution notes the treatment  of Geronimo and the Apache people at  the hands of both the Mexican and the  U.S. Governments. It should serve as a  lesson that government is often prone  to error, incompetence and corruption,  and that the larger government grows  in size and power, the more pronounced  and frequent these errors and misdeeds  and mistakes indeed are made.  It should make us shudder to think  in a matter of weeks how this Congress  has spent more than $1 trillion of borrowed money  to grow  the  size and  power  of  the Federal Government.  Today we see problems in this country,  problems of poverty, problems of joblessness, hopefully not a massive increase in homelessness, but sometimes  hopelessness, and that is a sure sign,  and the question is whether big government actually is helping to overcome  those issues or is a hindrance to the  people  in  their ability  to overcome  those particular issues.  This resolution I hope will  inspire  fresh thinking about the direction of  our government with  respect  to all  American citizens, Native Americans  and non-Native Americans alike, and  hopefully will  inspire us to consider  the road we as a country are taking,  and if it is indeed to require greater responsibility  for  individuals,  does  it  help with individuals being able to succeed on their own. That is the course,  that is the question, and I think this  resolution does move us in that direction to ask those kinds of pertinent  questions that are important, not just  for this specific individual, but pertinent for all of us.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
187,16,2009-02-23,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from American Samoa (Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA).  KILDEE.  (Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA  asked  and  was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
188,16,2009-02-23,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speaker,  I do want to commend the chairman of  our Natural Resources Committee, Mr.  RAHALL, and the ranking member, Congressman HASTINGS, and especially my  good friend, the chief sponsor of this  legislation, the gentleman  from Arizona, Mr. GRIJALVA, and a cosponsor,  Congressman DALE I know  that our colleague TOM COLEwould  have loved to also have been an original cosponsor of this bill. Congressman  COLE from Oklahoma is the only Native American Member  of Congress  that we have. He is a proud member of  the Chickasaw Nation from the State  of Oklahoma.  Mr. Speaker,  the name Geronimo  evokes and brings to light other issues  and I think something that we ought to  be reminded of in light of our government’s relationships and our treatment  of the Native Americans, or American  Indians.  Geronimo, or as he was known when  he was born, Goyathlay or Goyaale, his  name means in the Chiricahua Apache  language  ‘‘one who yawns.’’ Interestingly enough, Geronimo was born in  1829. In 1851, a company of some 400  Mexican soldiers raided the Chiricahua  campsite while Geronimo and his fellow warriors were away.  b1545  And as a result of this raid on their  settlement, his wife, his children and  mother were killed. The Chiricahua  Apache—and, by the way, I wanted to  note also, Mr. Speaker, that the place  where Geronimo was born is now in  Clifton, what is now known as the town  of Clifton in Arizona, and I suspect this  is probably why my colleague from Arizona wanted to make sure that there’s  proper recognition for this great Chiricahua Apache chief.  What was stated here in the history,  that his wife, his children, and his  mother were killed by  the  soldiers,  Mexican soldiers, the Chiricahua chief,  Mangas Coloradas, sent Geronimo to  join Cochise’s warriors to  fight and  seek vengeance against the Mexican  Army. In one of the many battles he  fought, he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife, despite all  the firing and the bullets that came his  way, and so much so that the Mexicans  were praying then for their own safety  to their patron saint, Saint Jerome, or  I suppose in Spanish it’s Geronimo, and  this is how the name Geronimo started  ever since. Just wanted to give a little  sense of history.  Mr. Speaker, Geronimo was a military leader. He conducted raids in settlements along the Mexican and U.S.  borders. And  in geographical  terms,  you’re talking about areas that stretch  from Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and  even what is now known as Mexico.  Thousands of soldiers from both the  U.S. and Mexican military forces tried  to catch him for years and were unsuccessful in doing so, some 10 years, until  finally Geronimo surrendered, only because, I suspect, of lack of food supplies and provisions and support for his  little band of warriors and families.  Geronimo was transferred to a military prison in Florida, and then it was  at that time that the noted General  Nelson Miles who, after years of trying  to capture Geronimo, wrote in his journals  a  very  interesting  observation  concerning this great Chiricahua warrior chief. And I quote from General  Miles’  journal.  ‘‘Everyone  in Washington had now become convinced that  there was no good in this old chief and  he was, in fact, one of the lowest and  most cruel of the savages of the American  continent.’’ That’s not a very  positive descriptive, I must say, of how  people in those days described Native  Americans.  And in another part of General Miles’  journal, he said, and I quote, and this  is referring to Geronimo again,  ‘‘He  was one of the brightest, most resolute,  determined looking men that I have  ever encountered. He had the clearest,  sharpest, dark eye I have ever seen, unless it was that of General Sherman.’’  Mr. Speaker, Geronimo was eventually transferred to a military prison at  Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he died on  17  February  1909,  and  that’s  the  premise  of  this  resolution  in  celebrating  the  hundredth  anniversary  when this great Indian warrior chief  passed away in 17 February 1909. The  resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, honors this great Chiricahua Apache warrior.  And I’m reminded, when you mention  Geronimo, you also have to mention  other great Native American warrior  chiefs. I can think of Crazy Horse and  Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, among the famous warrior chiefs of the Lakota or  the Sioux Nation.  I  can  think  of  Cochise, also a Chiricahua Apache warrior chief, or Quanah Parker, a Comanche chief, or Tecumseh, a chief of the  Shawnee Nation, or Chief Joseph of the  Nez Perce Nation, or Chief Massasoit of  the Wampanoag tribe, and I suspect  that this  is where the name of the  State of Massachusetts had its origin  from this great Indian, Native American tribal chief from the Wampanoag  tribe. I can think also of Chief Pontiac  of the Ottawa tribe, as well as Black  Hawk of the Sac tribe.  All of this, in essence, Mr. Speaker,  and I want to share this with my colleagues. This resolution calls for a spiritual healing among the Apache people  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:42 Feb 24, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23FE7.026 H23FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

191,30,2009-02-23,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  bring you news from the front. This  week, in one of our neighboring country’s schools, an elementary school,  there was a raging gun battle for over  2 hours between  the bad guys,  the  Army, and of course the police were involved in all of this. I’m not talking  about a battle that took place in Iraq  or Afghanistan. I’m talking about a  battle that took place just south of our  border in Mexico—the border, the second front that we should be concentrating on as a Nation and be concerned about what’s taking place there.  In Reynosa, Mexico, right across the  Rio Grande River from McAllen, Texas,  is where this gun battle took place.  The Gulf Drug Cartel, in control of  Reynosa, was trying to move drugs  into the United States, and they got  involved with the Federal police and  soldiers. This battle kept going on because both sides kept getting reinforcements. At least five of the gang members were killed and five peace officers,  or Federal police, were killed. It is reported that teachers were shoving kids  on  the  floor, blocking  the windows  with desks and tables, trying to keep  down because of  the  ricochets  that  were taking place in the school.  One third grader said this: ‘‘We were  all crying. We were so afraid,’’ said this  9-year-old. She continued: ‘‘They could  have killed every one of us.’’  The gun battle took place on both  sides of the school. Then it moved into  a shopping area and other parts of  Reynosa.  The principal of the school had this  comment. She  said,  ‘‘The bad men  think they’re lords of the streets.’’ Mr.  Speaker, maybe they are.  This is gang warfare in Mexico. Just  last year, there were 6,000 people killed  in Mexico, most of them attributed to  the gang fights to try to control the  drugs that are coming into the United  States. Six thousand people? What does  that mean? Well, there have been 5,000  Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, less than the total number killed  just last year in Mexico. It’s reported  that one American a week is killed in  Mexico, maybe more than one a week.  The drug cartels murder police officers;  they kill elected officials; they chop  the heads off of police chiefs; and some  now have said that Mexico may be a  failed state because of the drug cartels  and the violence that is taking place  there.  I don’t know if it’s a failed state or  not, but it’s a serious epidemic, and  what is taking place that the drug cartels are in the center of this border war  has to do with four commodities—with  four commodities, Mr. Speaker. Two of  those commodities go north, and two of  those commodities go south. The drug  cartels, of course, are running drugs  and people into the United States. The  two of those that are going south are  the drug cartels that are helping to  control, of course, the money and illegal guns going back into Mexico, most  of those controlled by the drug cartels.  We know that many of the drug cartels  are working with the human smugglers, the coyotes, to have them bring  drugs  and  people  into  the United  States at the same time.  So the drug cartels are the enemy of  America. They’re working in Mexico. If  anyone thinks that they’re going to  stay south of the Rio Grande River,  they’ve not been very attune to what  has taken place. Much of Mexico, especially on the border, has been corrupted by the drug cartels. It is extremely violent. I’ve been down to the  Texas-Mexico border about 15 times,  and every time I go, the situation is  worse on both sides. Yet good folks on  both sides live in fear because of the  drug cartels and their violence, and  nothing is happening.  President  Calderon  has  answered  with 40,000 soldiers on the border. He  says,  ‘‘Mexico  confronts  a  historic  challenge to become a secure country,  a challenge to truly transform itself  into a country of law and order.’’  Well, good for President Calderon. I  hope he succeeds, but if we think it’s  going to stay south of the border, we’re  sadly mistaken.  Just  in  2007,  in my hometown of  Houston, in broad daylight, two rival  gangs, smuggling gangs, were going up  and down the freeway, shooting at each  other, trying to fight over a group of  illegals that one of them wanted to  take away from the other. You know,  that case, like many others, has gone  ignored mainly  by  the mainstream  media.  This country, Mr. Speaker, faces a  border war like we have never seen before, and so now I think we ought to  take some action on this side of the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:23 Feb 24, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23FE7.057 H23FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
192,44,2009-02-23,Mrs.  CHRISTENSEN.," Thank  Congresswoman FUDGE.  We prepared a few more just in case  we had some extra time  left  in the  hour.  So I’d like to also recognize and pay  tribute to some Virgin Island pioneers  in the area of environmental awareness  and energy conservation: Mr. Onaje  Jackson, Ms. Ann Marie Gibbs, Mr.  Bevan Smith, Mr. Jesus Espinosa, Mr.  Mario Francis, and Mr. Olasee Davis.  And those are just a few.  Mr. Onaje Jackson is best known in  the Virgin Islands and Caribbean region as a community partner who tirelessly promotes earth-friendly  infrastructure and facility design, engineering, and implementation. He began his  work when he realized that bad solutions for development in the Caribbean  were leading to divisions in communities and environmental damage. Deep  down, he knew that a lot of it had to do  with developers not being armed with  better solutions and designs at the outset of their conception process.  With this, Mr. Jackson set out to  bring about a more holistic approach  to planning, design, and engineering of  island  infrastructure;  and  over  the  years, he has continually collaborated  with a broad cross-section of our community  to  design  environmentally  friendly solutions for our rapidly developing region. Individuals,  local businesses, and international organizations  all  enlist Mr.  Jackson’s  assistance  when seeking to incorporate the latest  in  sustainable  and  renewable  technology to their large- and small-scale  development projects.  But Onaje has not worked alone.  Along with many others, he has worked  tirelessly with others that I named before: Bevan Smith, the director of the  Virgin  Islands Energy Office; Olasee  Davis, community conservationist, activist, and professor at our university;  Ms. Ann Marie Gibbs, a high school  science  teacher;  community activist  Jesus Espinosa, and Mario Francis,  who have each worked to educate our  entire community, but particularly our  children, about the importance of conservation.  Each of these valued members of our  community go above and beyond the  call of duty to challenge our youth, to  break through the walls of ignorance  and profit to become stewards and protectors of our environment for generations to come.  So  it’s without reservation that  I  submit Mr. Jackson, Mr. Smith, Ms.  Gibbs, Mr. Espinosa, Mr. Davis, and  Mr. Francis as unsung heroes as they  are environmental pioneers of the Virgin Islands community; and I am convinced that they will remain at the  forefront of our community’s efforts to  preserve and conserve the natural resources that make the U.S. Virgin Islands the precious jewel that they are.  Their work, and that of others, has  prepared us to use the opportunities  that have been recently presented to us  in the recently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and others  that I am sure will be a part of our  President’s promise of change.  And since we have some time left, I  want to pay tribute to someone who is  not only a local hero in the U.S. Virgin  Islands but my personal one, my father.  Born at home and largely raised by  his  grandmother while  his mother  taught just about everyone in St. Croix  in those days, it was not easy for him  to go to college. He began at the most  accessible one geographically and  financially, although it is also an outstanding institution, the University of  Puerto Rico. He later transferred to  Colombia University in New York and  was in their school of law.  It was then in his first year that he  was drafted into the Army, probably  around 1943 also,  just  like Tuskegee  Airman Herbert Heywood. And after  graduating  from  Officer  Candidate  School at Camp Davis, North Carolina,  was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps and  participated  in  the Normandy  campaign and Pacific Theater operations.  After the war, he completed his studies at Colombia and took his family—  my mother and I—back home where he  embarked on what became a distinguished legal career. He was admitted  to practice before the Third Court of  Appeals in 1950 and the U.S. Supreme  Court in 1955.  He practiced law privately and often  for free or for chickens or for fish until  1962 when he was tapped by President  John F. Kennedy to be our U.S. Attorney for the U.S. Virgin Islands. He was  reappointed to a second term by President Lyndon Johnson.  But the most not just nonpartisan  but apolitical person I know of, he was  soon appointed to serve as the first native-born judge of the District Court of  the Virgin Islands by then President  Richard Nixon, and he retired  from  that post after serving several terms.  In his time on the bench, some of his  decisions were groundbreaking in Virgin Islands jurisprudence such as Red  Hook Marina  v. Antilles Yachting  Corp., which  resulted  in  the Open  Beach Law in the Virgin Islands; and  another  case, Hosier  v. Evans  and  Chapman v. Gerard, which he championed the constitutional right of children  from  other  Caribbean  islands  whose parents were brought in under  legal arrangements to work in the Virgin Islands temporarily. But he championed the rights of those children to  attend public school in the U.S. Virgin  Islands. Others of his decisions  set  legal precedents which are referred to  in cases up to this day.  I am justifiably proud of my father,  but so are the people of the Virgin Islands, and judges, and attorneys who  came in contact with him throughout  his long career. For the rest of the  United States, he is an unsung hero. So  I’m proud to have had this opportunity  to present this very brief and very incomplete synopsis of his life here this  evening.  With that, I yield back the balance of  my time  ",2009
193,44,2009-02-23,Ms. FUDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I will close  with this last unsung hero, Dr. Julian  Earls.  He has been referred to as a Renaissance Man, holding eight university degrees. He earned a bachelor’s degree in  physics from Norfolk State University  in Norfolk, Virginia; a Master’s degree  in radiation biology from the University of Rochester School of Medicine  and Dentistry in Rochester, New York;  and a Doctorate degree  in radiation  physics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He completed the equivalent of the Master’s  degree in environmental health at the  University of Michigan and is a graduate of the Program for Management  Development  at  Harvard  Business  School.  He was awarded the honorary Doctor  of Science degree by the Vaughn College of Aeronautics in New York, the  honorary Doctor of Pedagogy degree by  Nova Southeastern University in Florida, the honorary Doctor of Humane  Letters degree by North Carolina A&T  State University, Norfolk State University, and Wilberforce University in  Ohio.  In January 2006, Dr. Earls retired as  Director of the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration’s Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in Cleveland, Ohio, after a career  spanning  more  than  40 years. As director of  NASA Glenn from 2003 to 2005, he managed a budget in excess of 600 hundred  million and a workforce of over 3,000  employees.  He was responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the activities  required  to accomplish  the  center’s  mission which included research, technology, and systems development programs  in  aeronautical  propulsion,  space propulsion, space power, space  communications,  and  microgravity  sciences in combustion and fluid physics.  He is the author of 30 publications  and has been a distinguished Honors  Visiting Professor at numerous universities.  As a NASA executive, he has received  medals for outstanding leadership, exceptional  achievement,  and  distinguished service. He received the Meritorious Executive Presidential Rank  Award from President William J. Clinton in 1999 and from President George  Bush in 2004.

206,527,2009-02-23,Mrs. MALONEY.," Madam Speaker,  today  I  am reintroducing  the  ‘‘Whatever  it Takes  to  Rebuild Act’’.  A disaster can leave the tax base of an affected community eroded, necessitating Federal assistance to pay for essential services.  These essential services, including police, fire,  and school personnel, are even more critical  in the wake of a disaster. To aid communities,  Congress  created  the Community Disaster  Loan Program. While this program has worked  with great success, there are two significant  issues that need to be fixed. The first issue is  that this assistance is delivered in the form of  a loan and the second is that any loan is limited to $5 million. Providing this aid as a loan  can further delay the recovery of a local community and the $5 million cap does not allow  for adequate assistance for medium or large  communities.  The  ‘‘Whatever  It Takes  to Rebuild Act’’  would repeal the requirement that disaster affected communities epay the assistance they  receive under  the Community Disaster Loan  Program. This  legislation would permanently  repeal  the $5 million cap on  these  loans,  would make states eligible for this assistance,  repeal the cap that limits loans to 25 percent  of a municipalities operating expenses, and  would provide this assistance as grants when  the President waives the provisions for a catastrophic event. All of  these provisions are  aimed at giving the Federal Government the  tools and flexibility we need to fully respond  following a disaster.  This program was used most recently immediately following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. While it was able to provide significant  benefits, repayment requirements have raised  significant hurdles for many recipient communities. In the wake of a disaster, the government should give American communities the  financial assistance they need to get back on  their feet with no strings attached. That is why  HON.

207,527,2009-02-23,Mr. SAM  JOHNSON  of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, pursuant  to  the House Republican  standards on earmarks,  I am submitting  the  following  information  for publication  in  the  CONGRESSIONALRECORD regarding earmarks I  received as part of H.R. 1105, the FY 2009  Omnibus Appropriations Act.  Requesting Member: Congressman  SAM  JOHNSON  Bill Number: H.R. 1105.  Account: COPS Law Enforcement Technology.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: The City  of McKinney, Texas  Address of Requesting Entity: 222 N. Tennessee, McKinney, Texas 75070.  Description of Request: $300,000  in FY  2009 Department of Justice COPS Law Enforcement  Technology  and  Interoperability  funds to replace the City’s Public Safety Radio  System and to acquire interoperability capabilities.  The City of McKinney, Texas, was the fastest growing city with a population greater than  100,000 in the U.S. between 2000 and 2006,  according  to U.S. Census statistics released  last year. With a population  that has mushroomed  from 38,700  to 121,000  in only  ten  years, resources for many important projects  are strained. The current 800 MHz radio communications system, completed in 2001 when  McKinney’s population was half  its current  size, now has communications coverage deficiencies,  particularly  in  the  newer  growth  areas in southwestern McKinney. These ‘‘dead  spots’’ are experienced by all City radio system users (Police, Fire, EMS, Public Works,  etc.) and could compromise officer safety, citizen safety, and  the ability  to respond adequately  in emergency situations.

208,534,2009-02-23,Mr. PUTNAM.," Madam Speaker, on January  27, 2009, I introduced H.R. 728, the Seniors’  Tax Simplification Act,  legislation  that would  allow our nation’s senior citizens to file their  federal income taxes on a new and simplified  Form 1040S. This new  form would capture  sources of income commonly reported by seniors, including social security benefits, distributions from qualified retirement plans, annuities  or other deferred payment arrangements, interest and dividends, and capital gains and  losses.  Currently,  individuals who are age 65 or  over are prohibited from using Form 1040EZ.  Seniors  that do not qualify  for  the shorter  Form 1040A,  fill out a  longer, more complicated Form 1040 that deals with schedules,  and includes much that is simply not pertinent  to seniors’ taxable situations.  In  2004,  the House  of Representatives  unanimously passed legislation by a recorded  vote  to create Form 1040S. However,  the  Senate failed to consider the legislation and  the IRS has since halted their efforts to develop such a form even though their estimates  showed  that as many as 11 million seniors  could benefit from such a simplified tax form  in the first year it is made available.  The U.S. Census Bureau projects in 2030,  when all of the baby boomers will be 65 and  over, that nearly one in five U.S. residents is  expected to be 65 and older. This age group  is projected to increase to 88.5 million in 2050,  more than doubling the number in 2008, which  was 38.7 million.  Further, in Florida alone, the 65 and over  population  represent over 3.3 million  residents—that’s 17.4 percent of the state’s total  population. Recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau project  this population will only  continue to grow. By 2025, Florida’s 65 and  over population is projected to reach close to  5.5 million residents. This represents a 107.3  percent increase from 1995 to 2025.  The 60 Plus Association has also endorsed  this  important  legislation stating  the  ‘‘senior-  friendly proposal would dramatically simplify  the federal income tax filing process for millions of our nation’s senior citizens.’’  It is clear that millions stand to benefit from  the Seniors’ Tax Simplification Act, and countless hours of time and energy could be saved  not fretting over complex and often confusing  tax forms. I encourage my colleagues to support our nation’s seniors and cosponsor this  long overdue legislation.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.  This title requires all such committees  to notify the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest—designated by the Rules Committee—of the time, place, and purpose  of the meetings, when scheduled, and  any cancellations or changes  in the  meetings as they occur.  As  an  additional  procedure  along  with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily  Digest will prepare this information for  printing in the Extensions of Remarks  section of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  on Monday and Wednesday of each  week.

210,5,2009-03-06,Mr. BOEHNER.," Let me thank my  colleague for yielding and suggest that  this continuing resolution we have on  the floor today shouldn’t be for the  next 4 or 5 days; it really ought to be  through the end of this  fiscal year,  which is September 30th of this year.  I know there are a lot of Members  that have a lot of other issues that  they would like to include in this, but  the fact is that American families are  hurting, small businesses are hurting  around the country, our economy  is  hurting, and I think we can help our  economy and we can send a strong signal to the American people by extending this spending freeze through September 30th.  Let’s show the American taxpayers  that we get it. Let’s show investors in  our American economy that we get it.  Because clearly the bill that has been  under consideration both here in the  House and now in the Senate has a $30  billion increase over last year’s spending and includes nearly 9,000 earmarks,  and the way to put all of this to a stop  is to just have a spending freeze. Let’s  show the American people we understand the pain that they are under and  show them that we are willing to tighten our belt.  So when we have our opportunity to  offer our motion to recommit at the  end of this process, there will be an extension  of  that  date  through September 30th, with some increases for  those  in police departments and the  FBI and other law enforcement jurisdictions, and  it  is something that I  think is a responsible way forward. I  would encourage my colleagues to support the motion to recommit.  ",2009

212,5,2009-03-06,Mr. DREIER.," Madam  Speaker,  thank my friend for yielding.  To  paraphrase  the  late Admiral  James Stockdale from his famous vice  presidential debate of nearly 17 years  ago, why are we here?  I don’t quite get this. I know there  will be some who want to blame George  Bush  or  any  other Republican  out  there, but the fact of the matter is, for  the first time in a long time, we have  a Democratic President, a Democratic  House of Representatives and a Democratic United States Senate, and yet  we at this moment are dealing with the  possibility of a government shutdown.  I just don’t quite comprehend this.  The American people, as our Republican  leader and my California colleague,  the  distinguished  ranking  member of the committee, have said,  the American people are hurting. We  know very well with the unemployment rate that just came through it  today at 8.5 percent, a one-half percent  increase over 8 percent, that there are  a lot of people who are suffering. We  know of individual stories, and I have  got to tell you the most painful one for  me was to hear of the father of three  young teenagers who committed suicide out in California over this.  So, we have a very, very difficult  challenge ahead of us, and yet we are  sitting here dealing with this issue and  a massive increase in spending, which  clearly the American people do not  want. It is a policy that has failed. It  failed throughout the 1930s.  We know what needs to be done,  Madam Speaker, for us to get our economy back on track. What we need to do  is we need to follow the model that was  put  forward by John F. Kennedy  in  1961, the model of Ronald Reagan in  1981, because those solutions have in  fact succeeded in the past. And yet we  know that massive increases in spending, as  the  rest of  the world has  learned, are not the answer for the future.  I strongly support our effort to keep  this spending as low as possible by supporting our motion to recommit.  ",2009
213,5,2009-03-06,Mr. LEWIS  of California.," Madam  Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes  to  the Republican Conference  chairman, the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. PENCE).  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
214,5,2009-03-06,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, we  come to this well at a very difficult  time in the life of our Nation. American families are struggling under the  weight of this recession. Millions of  Americans are watching as their life  savings are evaporating before their  eyes. My own family has been touched  by the hardship in the housing crisis  and by job loss. So I come to this floor  with a sense of urgency, and it is a  sense of urgency that was confirmed  this morning with the jobs report and a  startling reality.  But in the midst of these very difficult times, the American people are  rising to the occasion. As we speak in  this well  this morning, millions of  Americans are doing  in  their  small  businesses, in their family farms and  around their kitchen tables what this  Congress should be doing. They are  finding places to save. They are putting off expenditures that they don’t  have to make this year to make sure  they make ends meet for the priorities  in their lives.  Yet this Congress, by this massive  omnibus bill, is going on with spending  as usual. An 8 percent increase in Federal spending, the largest increase in a  single year since I was in high school  in the 1970s, apart from those months  following September 11th, is not what  the American people expect to see this  Congress doing.  ‘‘Spending as usual’’ with thousands  upon thousands of earmarks and special projects is not what the American  people expect from this Congress during  these  difficult  times. Madam  Speaker, they want to see the Congress  doing what they are doing, and that is  making  careful decisions, practicing  fiscal  discipline  and  setting  aside  ‘‘business as usual’’ to confront these  challenging times.  b1100  And so I rise today to say, let’s not  just do this continuing resolution for a  week but, as others have said, for the  rest of this year, let’s freeze Federal  spending in virtually every area of the  government. Let’s say no earmarks in  the Year 2009.  And it’s not a value judgment on the  Members who’ve made those project requests. I, myself, don’t request projects  of that nature. But it is to say, Madam  Speaker, that in these difficult times,  we have to do what every American  family, every small business owner and  every family farmer is doing, and that  is making sacrifices and practicing discipline.  I urge my colleagues in both parties  to  join  the minority  today  in  supporting our motion to recommit. It’s a  motion that would essentially  freeze  all Federal spending, say to historic increases in spending in these difficult  times, no to earmarks, and say yes to  the practiced values of millions of  Americans in these difficult days.

219,12,2009-03-06,Mr. KIRK.," Madam Speaker, it is increasingly clear that the stock market  is voting against many of the policies  put  forward by  this Congress. With  stocks falling to 12-year lows, we have  to reexamine the policies that we are  pursuing here and ask are they not  helping and potentially actually hurting our future?  In past years losses in the stock market hurt Americans  indirectly. Most  people in the middle class did not own  stock or rely on  it  for their retirements. But today after the rise of the  individual retirement accounts and the  investor middle class,  losses  in  the  market directly affect the income and  especially the retirement savings of  many Americans.  Now, in this Congress we have embraced  a  high-spending,  high-borrowing, high-tax future for the American economy. As the details of our  plans became clear, America’s  long-  term investments rapidly declined in  value. If the losses sustained in recent  days continue, then the market DOW  increase would actually fall to zero by  this summer.  In my judgment, it’s time to reassess, in a truly bipartisan way, the legislation that we need to improve our  policies towards the long-term future  of our economy, towards investors and  especially equities on the stock market.  Recently, I joined Congressman GARY  ACKERMAN, Democrat from New York,  to back legislation that would reimpose the uptick rule and suspend the  current application of  the mark-to-  market rule. These two reforms, and a  ban on issuing insurance to buyers who  have no insurable interest in property,  would do a great deal to reassuring our  markets. These reforms would not directly confront the policies of President Obama or his current vision; they  would actually add to his policies, and  they would quickly act  to  reassure  markets,  right now on a downward  asset spiral that is crippling both credit and equity markets.  On the mark-to-market rule, look at  what a typical transaction looks like  today. We know that 90 percent of  mortgages are being paid on time and  in full. But any collection of mortgages  right now,  if bunched together, will  have a market value of  zero; even  though 90 percent of the mortgages are  paid; even though for the 10 percent of  homes where mortgages are not paid,  the mortgage owner would be able to  foreclose on the property, taking control of land and potentially a house or  buildings that do have a value. The  current mark-to-market rule is generating the wrong answer, that these assets actually do not have zero value.  But because the mark-to-market rule  forces  accountants  to  place  a  zero  value on these assets, there is a downward spiral in banking and financial  equities that is ruining our long-term  retirement savings.  We faced this problem in the past.  President Roosevelt, when he  faced  this problem actually five times worse  than the one we face today, put forward the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation that  looked at this problem  in  which half of all mortgages, not 10 percent, were in trouble. And what he said  was this, through the Home Owners’  Corporation: We would look at a more  bureaucratic  formula  of  the  rental  value of a property, of its underlying  salvage value, or of a value of other  properties that did have a market in  recent days in which we looked at the  sales over a longer period of time. The  answer  that was  generated  by  the  Home  Owners’  Loan  Corporation  showed that the asset actually did have  a value and stopped the downward spiral of the market.  Right now we need to impose a formula well understood in the 1930s that  would generate  the  correct answer,  that a collection of mortgages, 90 percent of which are paid, do not have zero  value and therefore should suspend the  mark-to-market rule to prevent the attack on equities today.  Likewise, with the mark-to-market  rule generating the wrong answer, calling assets which actually have a value  being valueless, we should reimpose the  uptick rule to prevent the sustained  negative attack on equities that are  going on, driving a number of public  companies who have substantial values  into bankruptcy.  Lastly, we should look very carefully  at credit default swaps, engineered and  put forward most strongly by AIG. We  need to prevent anybody from buying  insurance on an underlying asset of  which they have no interest whatsoever.  Next week I will introduce the Stock  Market Recovery Act. It will include  these reforms to stop this downward  spiral. We have spent enough. We have  added $2 trillion in debt. Now we need  these commonsense, bipartisan reforms  to send a different signal to the stock  market.  f  ",2009

That’s the amount of  money we print and is in circulation.  Just after the 2007 time period, it shot  straight up. It’s going up like a rocket.  Now, what does that mean?

232,19,2009-03-06,Mr. GOHMERT.," Thank you. And I appreciate those insights.  Here’s another chart that this leads  into very well that kind of tracks the  deficit that’s been growing. Of course  we know the Constitution requires that  there is not a dollar spent in the whole  Federal Government that is not appropriated—made available—by the Congress. If it’s not made available by the  Congress, it doesn’t happen. And because there had been too much spending earlier before November of 2006, the  voters said,  ‘‘Enough.’’ And they listened to the arguments of what is now  the majority party,  the Democratic  Party, and said,  ‘‘You know, they’re  right. They’re spending too much.’’  So, as of January 2007, the Democratic majority, led by Speaker PELOSI  from San Francisco, took over the government and took over the deficit. Because I know all three of us here on the  floor that are engaged in this discussion were against deficit spending in  2005 and 2006 by our own party when we  were in charge. I know that we all were  hoping the deficit spending would stop.  The  economy was doing okay, you  know, in 2007. It wasn’t great, but it  was doing all right.  But then as of January 2007, that’s  where we were on this chart.  Now the green is the Federal deficit,  the orange here is discretionary spending that’s within our control, and then  the mandatory spending are the programs like Social Security and Medicare, that kind of thing.  And so you look at what happened  from January of 2007, right here, this  big jump up is when the stimulus was  passed in January of 2008. And that was  passed with Speaker PELOSI’s leadership. It got passed. And you may recall  the microphone picked me up asking  the President as he went by—because I  knew $40 billion of that was going in  rebates to people that didn’t pay anything in income tax—so I asked the  President, ‘‘How do you give a rebate  to people who didn’t put any ‘bate’ in?’’  And I still think that’s a legitimate  question because now we’re doing  it  again. We’re giving a rebate to people  who didn’t put any  ‘‘bate’’  in, they  didn’t pay in the first place. So how is  it a rebate?  Then we have this next big hump.  That came with the pre-TARP loans.  And then the big hump was TARP and  the auto bailouts spiking. And then  low and behold, here is the stimulus II,  the $787 billion and then the $410 billion omnibus that this Congress has  done, that this Congress is responsible  for. And you see this extraordinary  spike in the deficit.  Now,  just because there was some  overspending by Republicans doesn’t  mean you put that times or squared or  cubed. This is insane. It has to stop.  I also want to point out a bill that  was passed this week from the House  regarding cramdown. I mean, it gets so  discouraging in here when every bill we  pass  is hurting  the  economy. You  know, it makes you wonder, is somebody back there thinking, Well, eventually, if we hurt it enough, the government will take over and then all of  our problems are over. Because I know  that  everybody  that  serves  in  this  body, they want the best for the country; it’s just that some do not have  enough faith in the American people  that they’ll know how to spend their  money.  You know, we saw the great quote  from Senator KERRY, ‘‘But if you gave  the American people their own money  back, gave  them  that kind of  tax  money  back, well,  they might not  spend it the right way.’’ Well, that’s insane: Let the American people get us  out of this problem; the government  certainly hasn’t done it.  But going back  to  this mortgage  cramdown bill. Here you have community banks that have been doing a good  job of lending despite the onerous burdens that’s been put on them by this  Congress, going back to the ’90s, again,  before we were here, but this Congress  required lenders to lend to people who  might not be able to pay back. Even  with that, they were doing okay.  This provision, for the first time in  our history, the history of the country,  will allow a bankruptcy judge to materially drop the principal on a mortgage. The banks have to rely on the  value of the mortgages on their balance sheets. If they can’t, then they  appear to be insolvent. That gets them  in trouble. These are solvent banks.  You pass a law like this, and not only  that, this bill allows bankruptcy courts  to grant a no-interest 30-year mortgage  as an alternative to dropping the principal materially.  ",2009
233,19,2009-03-06,Mr. CONAWAY., Will the gentleman  yield?  ,2009
234,19,2009-03-06,Mr. GOHMERT., I certainly will.  ,2009
235,19,2009-03-06,Mr. CONAWAY.," The perverse impact  of the cramdown provision is that we  will have fewer mortgages. If you’re a  banker and you are lending money for  a 30-year payout, then you have got to  be very secure in your collateral because circumstances come and go with  respect to the borrower’s ability to  repay—their health, all of those kinds  of things—but if you’ve got a 30-year  loan, which you’re on the hook to leave  out  there as  long as  the customer  makes those payments, then the collateral is a huge piece of why you decide  to make that loan.  b1330  If bankruptcy judges are now allowed  to come in and adjust that value of the  collateral  to  the  banker,  then  the  banker is going to react in a couple of  ways; one, that the banker on the front  end is going to say, okay, now if the  bankruptcy judge has this authority to  reduce the value of my collateral, then  I’m going to be willing to loan less  money, which means that instead of  coming up with the traditional 20 percent down—before we got  into  the  subprime nonsense that went on, but  the typical 20 percent down—banks are  going to insist on much higher down  payments because they’ve got to be assured that throughout the life of that  loan, the collateral never gets upside  down, that if the borrower quits paying, that they can get that house back  and pay off the rest of the loan by selling that house.  They will also respond by raising interest rates, because interest rates reflect risk  for the borrower and the  lender; the higher the interest rates,  the more  likelihood  that  that  loan  could default at some point in time.  So this cramdown provision will put  a chilling effect on future home mortgages, which may be the intent. One of  our colleagues said on a talk show with  a fellow that, you know, maybe this individual homeownership is overrated.  Maybe we don’t want Americans owning their own homes because they can’t  handle the responsibility for paying it  off. And so let’s put in some public policy things that will help discourage  homeownership, which doesn’t make a  lot of sense to me, but then I was just  listening and was trying to understand  what this person was saying. But these  cramdown  provisions  will  have  a  chilling effect on future home mortgages if they are left in place, as was  contemplated in this bill.  ",2009

246,1,2009-03-17,Mr. BOEHNER.," I welcome my colleagues to St. Patrick’s Day and I hope  everyone has a happy one.  Madam Speaker, we are 2 months  into this Congress, and Washington has  done nothing  to ease  the economic  challenges facing middle class families  and small businesses.  We’ve watched  the  administration  approve another $350 billion for more  bailouts for the financial industry, and  we’ve watched passage of a trillion-dollar  ‘‘stimulus’’ bill, and  then we’ve  watched the passage of a $410 billion  omnibus bill  loaded with some 9,000  unscrutinized earmarks.  Soon we are going  to debate  the  President’s  budget,  a  budget which  spends too much, taxes too much, and  borrows too much from our kids and  our grandkids. This budget raises taxes  on everyone, from middle class families  to small businesses, to seniors and to  schools. It even punishes anyone who  would have the audacity to flip on a  light switch thanks to a brand new $646  billion energy  tax. This means  less  money in the family budget and more  jobs being shipped overseas.  The American people are looking for  real  solutions  that will help create  jobs, rebuild savings, and create more  investment  in our economy. And  in  spite of what some disingenuous political operatives are saying, Republicans  are offering better solutions.  So  far  this year, we’ve presented  clear, superior alternatives to Washington Democrats’  flawed proposals.  We’ve asked the administration for an  exit strategy to get the government  back out of the private sector and get  taxpayers off the hook for more billions in handouts to the financial sector. Our whip, ERICCANTOR, and I personally delivered to the President an  economic recovery plan that would create twice as many jobs as the Democrats’ plan at half the cost. And we  fought for a spending freeze as the majority fought for their bloated $410 billion omnibus spending bill.  Listen, the American people are fed  up with what they’re seeing here in  Washington. Don’t  they  deserve  to  keep more of what they earn as we try  to get this economy back on track?  Don’t  they deserve better  solutions  than the spending, taxing, and borrowing that they’re seeing out of this  Congress?  Republicans are offering better solutions, and we hope the majority will  join us.  THE CONTINUED NEED FOR  HEALTH REFORM  ",2009

Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  speak on an issue that continues to be  a top priority for American families  and businesses, one that is fundamentally intertwined with the strength of  our Nation’s economy and the government’s long-term fiscal sustainability.  I’m speaking, of course, about the need  for health care reform.  Health  care  costs  in  the United  States are rising at an alarming rate.  Yet despite the  fact that we spend  more per capita on health care than  any other  industrialized country, we  produce some of the worst outcomes by  a number of important health measures. Furthermore, the U.S. remains  the only developed nation that does  not guarantee health coverage as a  right to its citizens.  Recent estimates indicate that over  45 million Americans lack health insurance, leaving one in six without access to proper medical care. Even more  shocking is that over 80 percent of the  uninsured come from working families.  Health care costs are imposing an increasing burden on families and placing employers at a further competitive  disadvantage in our global economy.  Now, as we seek to unfurl the complex economic challenges  facing our  country, it remains abundantly clear  that our success will not only depend  on our ability to stem housing foreclosures and create new jobs; it will  also depend on our will to change a system of health care that is fundamentally  flawed  and under  tremendous  strain.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

249,8,2009-03-17,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, mistaken  policies, misplaced  priorities,  and  profound  irresponsibility  have  brought us where we are today. President Obama and this Congress are committed to real change. And what  is  that change? We propose solutions, real  solutions. An honest budget, rejecting  gimmicks, and eliminating the wasteful spending that has brought us to this  trillion dollar deficit that we now have  today.  What the American people need are  tax cuts, and 95 percent of Americans  will now receive a tax cut. What do the  American people need? A double commitment of  the  investment of Pell  grants, of looking at a commitment to  Head Start, and so many of the other  vital areas.  When we look at this Congress, we  are committed to fixing health care,  not to be a party of ‘‘no,’’ but to say  that we are going to address what is  happening for struggling homeowners.  The American Recovery Act  addressed and is helping us to bring forward 3.5 million jobs to help stabilize  the State budgets and to dig us out of  this fiscal mess that we inherited over  the last 8 years.  We can recover, we must recover, because as Americans, failure is not an  option.  above-type person. We need a diversity  of energy sources. But we will not be  carbon free for generations.

If we’ve got to have something, it’s better for us to buy it from  ourselves,  for our workers,  for  the  money to stay here.  In Louisiana alone, my home State,  oil and gas production in the petrochemical industry employs 320,000 people. They work as welders, pipe-fitters,  on barges, engineers. Countless small  businesses with another 100,000 or so  workers. Yet the President’s budget  contains at  least eight separate tax  hikes specifically targeting domestic  oil and gas production.  Tax hikes create uncertainty, uncertainty creates caution, and caution inhibits economic activity. As we seek  energy security and to create and preserve American jobs, I have to ask why  are we punishing the industry which  contributes both?  ",2009
250,8,2009-03-17,Mr. BUCHANAN.," Mr. Speaker, the  American people were outraged yesterday, and with good reason, when they  learned that the bonuses of $165 million  were going to executives at AIG, an insurance company. They are the very  executives who drove the company to  the ground and helped create the economic problems we’re facing today. Instead of getting bonuses, they should  be fired.  AIG is now 80 percent owned by the  Federal Government, which  is  the  American people. This is an outrageous  injustice at taxpayers’ expense.  I have been in business 30 years. We  always pay for results, proven results,  in this case something that would be a  return to the American people. But  that hasn’t happened. This  rewards  greed and recklessness.  AIG  recently  reported  in  a  2008  fourth quarter more than $60 billion in  losses, all while the unemployment in  America hit a 25-year high.  I ask the President to use all the  power at his disposal to prevent these  bonuses from being paid at taxpayers’  expense.  f  f  FORMER  VICE  PRESIDENT  CHENEY’S  ATTEMPT  TO  REWRITE  HISTORY  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
251,8,2009-03-17,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker,  on  Sunday former Vice President Cheney  made the  latest  in a series of outrageous attempts to rewrite history.  He suggested that America was  less  safe now than under President Bush.  Well, as a former journalist and editor,  I’m compelled to do a little rewrite of  his story.  I think it is important to note that  under President Bush and Vice President Cheney, we let Osama bin Laden  escape. We took our eye off the ball in  Afghanistan and moved to  Iraq. We  went into Iraq with no plan for victory.  We heard from Vice President Cheney  that we were going to be greeted as liberators, that WMD would certainly be  found, and that this war was going to  be very short and cost us very little  money.  My editing of Vice President Cheney’s statement on Sunday would be  that he did not exactly tell the whole  story.  Fortunately,  the American  people  know the whole story. They know that  we are much safer now with President  Obama in the White House. So as the  recently departed Paul Harvey would  have said, ‘‘And now you know the rest  of the story.’’  f  CALLING FOR  100 PERCENT TAX  ON  ‘‘PERFORMANCE’’  BONUSES  BY ANY COMPANY IN WHICH THE  GOVERNMENT OWNS A MAJORITY STAKE  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
252,8,2009-03-17,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, we all  know the news yesterday that AIG is  paying over $100 million in bonuses. I  find this an absolute outrage. I’m glad  the President has directed the Treasury Department to use all legal means  to restrict these bonuses.  But we  in Congress  can actually  make the laws, and here’s a law we  should make: Tax the bonuses of any  company  in which  the  government  owns a majority stake at 100 percent. I  have introduced this bill today—tax so-  called  ‘‘performance’’ bonuses at 100  percent.  Bonuses are supposed to be given to  someone who has done a good job. But  AIG, as my colleague said, and we’ve  found something we agree on, lost over  $70 billion in the last quarter. We put  in $170 billion of taxpayers’ money.  They don’t deserve a bonus. They deserve better management. They deserve certainly a restriction on the bonuses that they have. And I really applaud President Obama, who said yesterday that this isn’t just a matter of  dollars and cents; it’s a matter of fundamental values.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  taxing this bonus.  f  ENERGY  (Mr. CASSIDY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009

I want to yield to  my  friend  from South Dakota  (Ms.  HERSETHSANDLIN) for 2 minutes.  MS.  HERSETH  SANDLIN.  Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Missouri for yielding. I rise in strong  support of House Resolution 211, a resolution Supporting the Goals and Ideals  of National Women’s History Month.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this  resolution, along with many of my colleagues, and would like to thank Congresswoman WOOLSEY for introducing  this legislation, recognizing the critical role women have played in shaping  the Nation we are proud to call home  today.  Women like the pioneers who helped  settle the great plains in the West, the  women  who  were  the  suffragettes  working to ensure women’s right to  vote, the role of so many women on the  home front and abroad throughout our  Nation’s history and serving  in our  Armed Forces, the important and positive  influence of women across  the  country  in the workplace,  in public  service, and throughout our communities.  Although we have certainly come a  long way in ensuring equal treatment  of women, challenges do remain.  In  recognition of the need to address the  obstacles women still face, President  Obama signed an executive order recently, creating the White House Council on Women and Girls, and I was honored to participate in the signing ceremony at the White House.  Given the number of working mothers in South Dakota, one of the highest  numbers per capita in the country, and  having  recently  become  a working  mother myself, I will be particularly  interested in this new council’s focus  on this aspect of women and families. I  am proud of the progress we have made  to integrate the stories of heroic American women into the discussion of our  Nation’s history. I encourage schools  and organizations across the country  to participate in the celebration of National Women’s History Month and  make their own unique contribution to  the ongoing narrative of the history of  women in America.  I would like to thank again Congresswoman WOOLSEY for introducing this  important resolution. I thank her for  her leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution.  ",2009

256,15,2009-03-17,Ms. TITUS.," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.  Today I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 211 and National Women’s History  Month, which  this  year  celebrates  women who are taking the lead to save  our planet. Women have played a critical role in the fight to protect the  Earth as activists, scientists and public  servants. In Nevada, many of the early  environmental  activists,  like  Tina  Nappe, were women inspired to act by  their  childhood  experiences  in  the  beautiful Silver State. They have been  joined by respected scientists, such as  Dr. Peg Rees, dedicated to finding new  ways to protect the desert for future  generations.  As public servants, women have also  made a significant contribution to saving our planet. In the Nevada legislature, for example, our women members  have been ahead of their time, championing issues from renewable energy  development,  like Sheila Leslie,  to  smart growth, like Chris Giunchigliani.  These  many  accomplishments  are  being documented, analyzed and disseminated to the public by the Women’s Research Institute at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas under the  able direction of Dr. Joanne Goodwin.  But Women’s History Month is not  only a month of remembrance of the  important women of our past. It is an  inspiration for the next generation of  women and a call for them to continue  the fight to leave this precious rock a  better place to our children than we  found it. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman,  and thank you especially, Ms. WOOLSEY, for offering this important resolution that commemorates the 22nd anniversary of National Women’s History  Month.  ",2009
257,15,2009-03-17,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I believe today as we  move this important piece of legislation  recognizing Women’s  History  Month  that we  realize  that women  have played an important part in both  parties and in all the major issues of  our  time. Certainly when we  view  Susan B. Anthony through the role she  played as a strong women’s suffragette  and as a strong advocate for women’s  rights, the right of life, a strong pro-  life advocate, we realize that women  have played an important role in political decisions, decisions of war and  peace and in development of so many  things in our country. And they continue to do so today.  So, I would hope that as we recognize  Women’s History Month, we recognize  that women are just as independent in  their politics, in their desires and in  their beliefs as any man would ever  hope to be, and that we not falsely determine that somehow women will save  the planet where men won’t, or that  there aren’t women developing innovative solutions including next generation nuclear, wind and solar, and, beyond that, solutions that haven’t even  been talked about on the House floor.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

259,15,2009-03-17,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, today I rise in recognition of  National Women’s History Month.  WASSERMAN  With this year’s theme of  ‘‘Women  Taking the Lead to Save Our Planet,’’  I am pleased to recognize the many  women who have showed exceptional  vision and leadership in the ongoing efforts to save our planet, women like  Carol Browner, the White House Coordinator of Energy and Climate Policy,  Speaker NANCYPELOSI, the first ever  female Speaker of the U.S. House of  Representatives, Eileen Collins,  the  first woman shuttle commander, and  Nan Rich, my State senator, who just  became  the  first  female Democratic  leader in the Florida State Senate in  our history. These women exemplify  that a woman can do any job a man  can do. As we saw during the Presidential election, women like Secretary  of State Hillary Clinton showed Americans that women are ready to lead.  My daughter, Rebecca, turned in her  fourth grade biography report on Susan  B. Anthony  this week. She  and  I  learned together about the right to  vote and equal access to education for  women that she fought for so valiantly  but never lived to see. As the mother of  two young daughters, it is so important to me that they see strong women  taking the lead to repair our world.  As we  look to the  future and the  steps that must be taken to save our  planet, women can and will take the  lead.  ",2009

I would like to send a tribute out to all of the  women  trailblazers who have contributed so  much to our country. And I think St. Patrick’s  Day is the perfect time to remember them! I  would like to begin by sending a very special  thank  you  to  former Congresswoman Pat  Schroeder  of  Colorado;  Congresswoman  Carrie Meek of Florida; and Congresswoman  Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut; and to some  of the women Members who I had the honor  to serve with in this body and recently passed:  The Honorable Stephanie Tubbs-Jones  of  Ohio; The Honorable Julia Carson of Indiana;  and the Honorable Juanita Millender-McDonald of California.  I would also  like  to discuss a  few of  the  women who served as mentors to me over the  years. I remember growing up in Jacksonville,  back in the civil rights era in the United States.  And I knew I wanted to do something—get involved  in  something  big—to make  a  difference. And I was inspired by a strong willed  woman, Ms. Gwendelyn Sawyer Cherry, who  would stop at nothing to change the terrible ills  that our society, and  in particular, African  Americans, were facing in that time period.  Ms. Sawyer Cherry was  the  first African-  American woman  to practice  law  in Dade  County, Florida, and became one of the first  nine attorneys who  initially served at Legal  Services in Greater Miami in 1966. She was  elected as a state representative in 1970, becoming  the  first African-American woman  to  serve as a legislator for the State of Florida.

Because I think that if we  really are being for real about tackling  this, we have got to do it, and we have  got to require what this bill requires in  our prisons.  WATERS,  I just have to say today, on behalf of  my constituents, where we declared a  state of emergency in 1999 in the African American community in Alameda  County, on behalf of the entire country, thank you very much. It is a very  hopeful day.  I urge support of this bill, and look  forward to our continuing work and  getting it to President Obama’s desk so  he can sign this into law.  ",2009
264,22,2009-03-17,Mr. SMITH of Texas.,"  I am pleased  to be  original co-sponsor of H.R. 1429, the ‘‘STOP  AIDS in Prison Act of 2009.’’  The Stop AIDS  in Prison Act of 2009 requires  the  federal Bureau of Prisons  to develop a comprehensive policy to provide HIV  testing, treatment and prevention for inmates  in federal prisons.  This legislation will combat and prevent the  continued spread of HIV and AIDS among the  prison population and the community at large.  There are about 200,000 prisoners  in  the  federal system. But, the incidence of HIV and  AIDS  in  the prison population  is difficult  to  measure because not all inmates are routinely  tested.  In a 2006 report, the Justice Department estimated  that over one percent of  federal  inmates were known  to be  infected with HIV.  The United Nations Joint Program on HIV/  AIDS and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have historically defined  an HIV epidemic as occurring when the overall  percentage of disease among residents of a  specific geographic area exceeds one percent.  That means that the percentage of prisoners  who  carry  the HIV/AIDS  virus may  have  reached epidemic proportions.  The occurrence of HIV and AIDS cases in  federal prison  is at  least  three  times higher  among prison  inmates  than  it  is among  the  United States population as a whole.  H.R. 1429 requires routine HIV testing for all  federal prison inmates upon entry and prior to  release. For all existing inmates, testing is required within six months of enactment.  This  reasonable  requirement will  enable  prison officials to reduce HIV/AIDS among inmates and provide counseling, prevention, and  health care services for inmates who are infected with the disease.  For those prisoners tested when they enter  prison, such testing will ensure that they receive adequate treatment, education and prevention services while incarcerated.  Similarly, it is important that prisoners are  tested shortly before release into the community so that adequate services can be coordinated for the prisoner after release. That, in  turn, will protect the community.  I believe in tough punishment for criminal offenders because  the public deserves  to be  protected. But we have a duty to treat prisoners humanely and to rehabilitate them.  To me, preventing the spread of HIV and  AIDS among prisoners is an essential part of  humane treatment and rehabilitation.  I would like to thank my colleague on the  Judiciary Committee, Congresswoman WATERS, for her work on this legislation. Ms. WATERSand I worked together on earlier versions  of this bill in previous sessions of Congress.  She has been an energetic partner in this effort.  I would also  like  to  for helping bring  House floor today.  thank Chairman CONthis  legislation  to  the  YERS As my colleagues will  recall,  the House  passed a version of this bill last Congress by  voice vote. The bill was placed on the legislative calendar of the Senate, but it was never  acted upon. It is my hope that the Senate will  pass H.R. 1429 during this Congress.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 1429, ‘‘Stop AIDS in  Prison Act of 2009.’’ I want to thank my colleague Congresswoman MAXINEWATERS of  California for introducing this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1429,  which designed to address the growing impact  that HIV/AIDS is having on minority communities. According to the Black AIDS Institute,  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) statistics reveal that African Americans  account for half of all new HIV/AIDS cases.  Racial and ethnic minorities comprise 69 percent of new cases, according to the 2005 data  released  by  the  CDC.  African-American  women account for the majority of new AIDS  cases among women  (67 percent  in 2004);  whereas white women account for 17 percent  and Latinas 15 percent. The CDC estimates  that 73 percent of all children born to HIV infected mothers  in 2004 were African American. HIV/AIDS  is now  the  leading cause of  death among African Americans ages 25  to  44—deadlier  than heart disease, accidents,  cancer, and homicide.  The CDC reported that Hispanics accounted  for 18 percent of new diagnoses reported in  the  35  areas with  long-term,  confidential  name-based HIV  reporting  in  the United  States, and that most Hispanic men were exposed  to HIV  through sexual contact with  other men, followed by injection drug use and  heterosexual contact; and that most Hispanic  women were exposed to HIV through heterosexual contact, followed by injection drug use.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, African Americans made up 41 percent of  all inmates in the prison system at the end of  2004. Since African Americans are disproportionately represented in jails and prisons, the  Stop AIDS in Prison Bill is one way to begin  addressing this problem.  The ‘‘Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2009’’ directs the Bureau of Prisons to develop a comprehensive policy to provide HIV testing, treatment, and prevention  for  inmates  in  federal  prisons and upon reentry into the community.  The bill would require initial testing and counseling of inmates upon entry into the prison  system and then ongoing testing available up  to once a year upon the request of the inmate,  or sooner if an inmate is exposed to the HIV/  AIDS virus or becomes pregnant. Furthermore, the Bureau of Prisons will be required to  make HIV/AIDS  counseling  and  treatment  available  to prisoners, and give  testing and  treatment referrals to prisoners prior to reentering  the community. The bill protects  the  confidentiality of prisoners, and allows prisoners to refuse routine HIV testing.  Finally, the bill contains a requirement that  the Bureau of Prisons report to Congress, no  later than one year after enactment, the number of  inmates who  tested positive  for HIV  upon intake; the number of inmates who tested positive prior to reentry; the number of inmates who were not tested prior to reentry because  they were  released without sufficient  notice; the number of inmates who opted-out  of taking the test; the number of inmates who  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:04 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.036 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

271,36,2009-03-17,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I come this afternoon to the House of  Representatives  to bring a message  from Kansans and those who support  the Second Amendment.  The United States Supreme Court  ruled last year that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right  to own firearms and that Washington  DC’s gun ban is unconstitutional. This  decision was a win for all Americans  and sent a message to governments  across the country in support of Second Amendment freedoms.  Unfortunately  in  recent weeks we  have heard from administration officials and gun control advocates that  they are pushing to restrict an individual’s gun rights, the rights guaranteed  by our Constitution. Discussing escalating violence caused by drug cartels  in Mexico, U.S. Attorney General Eric  Holder  last month  called  for  reinstating the so-called assault weapons  ban.  This is the wrong approach. Instead  of punishing law-abiding American gun  owners,  our  citizens,  our  country  should be working to enforce existing  gun laws that outlaw illegal purchases.  We should secure our borders, and we  should work to increase the cooperation between the United States and  Mexican authorities.  Many Kansans are also concerned  about H.R. 45, legislation that has been  proposed to  license gun owners and  track firearms sales. I am hopeful that  this bill does not have the support to  be approved by this Congress.  An article in today’s Wichita Eagle,  our newspaper at home, highlights an  ironic twist. The article reports that  news of gun control efforts, along with  concerns that crime will increase with  a troubled economy, has ramped up the  demand for firearms and ammunitions.  Shortages are now common as retail  stores are having trouble keeping guns  and ammunition on the shelves.  I want to restate that our Founding  Fathers established a Bill of Rights to  our Constitution to make sure that  American citizens can live in freedom  without government intrusion. Human  liberty and  limited government are  principles I hold in high regard.  I stand with Kansans in opposing efforts that violate the Second Amendment, and I will continue to cast my  votes where it’s necessary to protect  our rights, including those provided for  by the Second Amendment.  f  ",2009

In June of 1948, the ‘‘Defenders’’ received their original Federal recognition and were activated several times  during the 1960s and 1970s to quell civil  disturbance  in Cambridge, Salisbury  and Baltimore, Maryland. In 1990, the  290th was mobilized both in support of  Operation Desert Shield and of Desert  Storm.  On September 11, the 290th was again  called to service to secure the crash  site at the Pentagon while rescue and  recovery operations took place. From  there, the 290th was mobilized under  Operation Noble Eagle  for homeland  defense.  The 290th was again called upon to  help support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. During the mission, the 290th provided force protection for key air bases, including those  in Pakistan.  In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf region, once again the  290th was sent to Mississippi to assist  local law enforcement with emergency  and relief operations. And, again, in  October 2007, the 290th was once again  mobilized and deployed in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom. This is a unit  that has been asked to serve our Nation all over the world and right here  at home, and each time  it has responded to the call of duty valiantly  and honorably. But now, deservedly,  they are home.  Our Nation’s greatest strength is the  men and women who selflessly give of  themselves to defend our ideals, and  their  families, who make  sacrifices  every day while their loved ones are in  harm’s way. I salute the 290th military  police  company  and welcome  them  home, and pledge to be an advocate for  them and all veterans of our Armed  Forces.  Celebrating the valor of our Armed  Forces is one thing, but here in Congress we must put our money where  our mouth is and support the men and  women of our Armed Forces, their families and our veterans, or we are merely  providing lip service to them.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the RECORD  the members of the unit from Maryland’s First  Congressional District,  who served so honorably.

277,36,2009-03-17,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  while I was running for Congress last  year, I noticed that Democrats everywhere were campaigning on the notion  that they were fiscally responsible and  would make wise decisions  for our  country based on what we could afford.  Frankly, as  the  former mayor of  Johnson  City, Tennessee, who  has  grown accustomed to balanced budgets  and  living within  our means,  this  sounded pretty good. It made me excited to come to Washington and get  our financial house in order.  My excitement, however, was short  lived when I realized how thoughtlessly  we would spend a billion dollars. First  we approved the second $350 billion of  the Troubled Asset Relief Program,  which is what people back home and I  call a bailout of our banking institutions. Then we approved $787 billion for  what was called economic  stimulus,  but what was in reality a laundry list  of  spending  items  the  Democrats  hadn’t been able to get funded the past  few years and won’t produce sustainable economic growth.  Just when I thought things couldn’t  get worse, we went out and passed a  fiscal year 2009 omnibus spending bill  that included $410 billion and an 8 percent increase for our Federal agencies.  I am going to pause for a second and  let that sink in, an 8 percent increase  at a time of record deficits where local  county, city and State governments  are cutting and balancing budgets.  I think the American people are so  skeptical of what’s happening in Washington because what they see people in  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:03 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.071 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

I would just add  that the Fair Tax does everything good  that anybody else’s tax proposal does  that is good, it does them all, and it  does them all better. And I do that  right before I yield to the real American leader on the Fair Tax, an individual whom I met when I was a State  legislator at an American Legislative  Exchange Council meeting, and I heard  from JOHNLINDER in that meeting. I  had no idea at the time I was going to  get to be his colleague, and I had no  idea at the time I would be able to  yield some time to our national leader  on the Fair Tax, ",2009
279,43,2009-03-17,Mr. JOHNLINDER.,  ,2009
280,43,2009-03-17,Mr. LINDER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding and  for organizing this  Special Order.  I think it might be good right now to  repeat what the Fair Tax is.  The Fair Tax would repeal all taxes  on income. No more corporate income  tax, personal income tax, no more payroll tax. Most Americans pay more in  payroll taxes than income taxes. That  pays for Social Security and Medicare.  We would get rid of the gift tax, the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax.  No more tax on income at all. And instead, we would tax a national sales  tax on everything that you purchased.  On average today, the average  income American gives the government  33 cents out of every dollar he earns.  Under the Fair Tax, they would give  the government 23 cents out of every  dollar they spend and raise the same  amount of money.  Now we are going to come to this  point  because  economic  forces  are  going to drive us to this point. I had  the privilege of visiting with Chairman  Bernanke last week or 10 days ago or  so. One day, whether I am here or not,  this Congress is going to decide the  only way to go is to a more fair tax,  that taxes not what you put into society, but what you take out.  Today we know that on average, 22  percent of what you pay for is the embedded cost to the IRS. With all of the  companies that it takes to get a loaf of  bread to your table, there are payroll  taxes, income taxes, there are compliance costs, they get embedded in that  price system. That is the only way a  business can pay a bill is through price.  And you pay that business’ light bill,  their rent, and their tax bill.  If we have a price system that is inflated by 22 percent because of the embedded cost of the IRS, that makes us  less than competitive in a global economy and jobs move into better tax jurisdictions offshore.  Secondly, the Tax Foundation said  that last year we spent $350 billion filling out IRS paperwork. We spend another $125 billion a year calculating the  tax implications of a business decision.  If we are spending in excess of $450 billion a year just to fill out forms to  send them in, that is inefficient. That  is stupid. It is like paying for a dead  horse. You get nothing from the transaction.  Third, the underground economy is  about $2 trillion a year. And the more  complex our code gets, the easier it is  to go underground and avoid paying  taxes. They are not contributing.  Fourth, there is today in offshore financial centers in dollar-denominated  deposits $13 trillion. My point to Chairman Bernanke was this: that is money  that would be on shore in our markets,  in our banks, if we didn’t have an IRS.  All four of those issues: the embedded  costs, the compliance costs, the underground economy, and the offshore investments, would be eliminated and  fixed by getting rid of the IRS. None of  them will  be  touched  by  nibbling  around the edges of our current tax  system.  Fifth is this point. We are having a  serious problem starting in real estate  in America because people can’t afford  to pay their mortgages. Some made  bad choices, but that is a simple fact.  Under the Fair Tax the average income  earner would have a 50 percent increase  in  take-home pay. They would pay  their mortgages. Now all of this stuff  gets  fixed  in  the  economy without  spending $700 billion here and $700 billion there without raising taxes and everything, as Mr. MICAsaid.  Lastly,  this point: we have never  taxed wealth in America; we tax wages.  The first thing very wealthy people do  is stop getting wages so they pay 15  percent on capital gains and dividends,  and if the Obama plan goes through,  they will pay a 20 percent tax. But they  don’t pay anything to Social Security  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:30 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.086 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

282,57,2009-03-17,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker,  I enjoyed  listening to my colleague  from Illinois. In fact, this is the second  time today I have heard him speak on  the floor and I have seen him point to  the picture of the coal miners and talk  about the problems of the Clean Air  Act. And I hope every American was  listening to that because that is exactly what we are talking about today.  We had, for decades, people burning  dirty coal, turning rivers and lakes in  other parts of the country, acid rain,  destroying forests, posing problems to  people’s health. And what this Congress did, in a bipartisan effort, was  create a mechanism to make it so that  it was no longer free to pollute the air  with dirty coal that created acid rain  and destroyed lakes and forests.  My friend didn’t want to talk about  the problems to health, didn’t want to  talk about the issues that relate to the  damage to the environment, or the fact  that we were able to create the most  effective market  system  in history  that was able to solve a real problem to  the environment, to health. Life went  on. Yes, there were some changes in  terms of  the  economy. There were  some people who didn’t—when it became too expensive for them to foul  the air, spoil our lakes, and destroy our  forests, then they shifted. Well, I would  suggest, Madam Speaker,  that  any  independent  observer would  suggest  that that was a solid program and a  good tradeoff.  I don’t hear my friend from Illinois  coming to the floor and saying, repeal  the Clean Air Act so we can have a few  more miners at work creating dirty  coal that is going to ruin our environment and destroy health. That issue is  over.  We are facing a very real challenge  today about what we are going to do to  protect the future of the planet. I will  get into, in a moment, talking about  some of the discussion that we have  heard from our friends on the other  side of the aisle, but one of the things  that is very, very important to note is  that they have no answer in terms of  what we do to the slow cooking of the  planet. They ignore the costs that are  being incurred right this minute. Temperatures in Alaska have already gone  up several degrees, permafrost  is no  longer permanent, roads are buckling,  coastal villages washed away. These  are costs and consequences that we are  already seeing as the ocean levels slowly, imperceptibly to most of us, but  very clear to scientists when they see  the fabled Inland Passage in the Arctic  Ocean free of ice, when we watch the  habitat shrink for arctic animals, when  we watch diseases shifting from vector  control—West Nile  disease,  for  instance, popping up in places where it  shouldn’t be, where invasive species are  infesting our forests. These are costs  and consequences that we are seeing  now that my friends on the other side  of the aisle refuse to come to grips  with.  But we are not going to be able to  have the same head-in-the-sand attitude that we saw from the Bush administration alone—of all the major governments in the world, alone—denying  the  imperative  of  global warming,  withdrawing from opportunities to be  collaborative on a national scale.  b1915  What we had to have in the last 8  years, where the other side of the aisle  simply accepted that sort of behavior  from their administration and, in fact,  aided and abetted and supported it, we  had over 900 cities across the country  come forward and say wait a minute,  we’re not going to wait for the Bush  administration and the Federal Government. We are going to take it upon  ourselves to deal with climate change  and  global warming  and move  to  change our local economy, to prepare  it for the future, and to help slow this  damage to the environment by carbon  pollution.  I come from a community in Portland, Oregon, where we have actually  reduced greenhouse gas emissions for 4  years  in a row. We’re very close to  being Kyoto compliant. It gave us an  opportunity,  frankly,  to create new  green  jobs. We were competing with  Houston and Denver for being the wind  energy capital of the United States because we’ve been serious about energy  conservation,  transportation  choices,  land use, all of the things that are  going to be part of a comprehensive solution to the threat of these changes to  the climate and the carbon pollution.  We’ve actually been able to make some  progress and be positioned to deal with  a carbon-constrained economy.  We need, Madam Speaker, for people  to reflect on what is happening now.  Just like my friend from Illinois didn’t  talk about the cost of acid rain. It  didn’t matter to him. He was concerned  about a few miners in his district and  didn’t care about the damage to forests  and human health and lakes and fishing. But we are already seeing the damage that is occurring as a result of climate change.  Speaking of acid rain, one of the  things we are seeing is that the ocean  is  slowly becoming more and more  acidic. This increased acidic content of  the ocean is having a consequence in  terms of damaging coral reefs. I mean  these are the rain forests of the ocean.  This is where billions and billions of  different animals and plants reside up  the food chain throughout the ecological system of the ocean that makes a  difference in terms of how people on  this planet are going to be fed. We are  watching what has happened. There  may be consequences in terms of the  Earth’s climate because of the change  in the ocean’s current and acidic level.  We are seeing across the country increases in extreme weather events, exactly what the scientists told us would  happen. Yes, the world’s atmosphere is  increasing in temperature. Yes, we’re  seeing an increase in the sea level that  could be 2 to 6 feet by the end of the  next century. But we are already seeing vast stretches of this country in  the flame zone being subjected to increased forest fires, to drought. In your  areas in the Southeast, you have seen  drought where it has not been a problem for years. In the Southwest, Lake  Mead that supplies the city of Las  Vegas is going down, causing massive  disruption. We are watching changes  that are  taking place  in  terms of  snowpack. My good  friend and colleague from the Pacific Northwest, Mr.  INSLEE, and I depend on snowpack for  water supply and energy production.  This makes a great deal of difference.  Madam Speaker, one of the concerns  I have as I am listening to our friends  on the other side of the aisle make  things up about what is going to happen with a proposal to reduce carbon  pollution and put a price on it, they assume somehow that this is going to result in money disappearing, that somehow this is just a tax that goes into the  great government maw and there  is  nothing that comes out the other end.  Well, as a practical matter, and I’m  confident that  in the course of this  hour as I work with my friend Mr. INSLEE, who I see poised here in the front  of the Chamber and I am hoping that  he’s willing to enter into this conversation with me because he knows a great  deal about it, we hope that we will be  able to encourage, if not our Republican  friends, at  least the American  people to look at the President’s budget. Look at what he has proposed to  begin a  comprehensive approach  to  transform our energy supply and slow  global warming.  Yes, he recommends putting a price  on carbon pollution, but he also recommends that this money would be  generated by having the carbon polluters pay for the privilege, just like  we did with acid rain so successfully  that my  friend  from Illinois now  is  against. There are opportunities to be  able to put this back into place because  the program, and I’m just quoting from  the President’s budget, would be implemented through a cap and trade, like  we did with acid rain, that will ensure  that the biggest polluters don’t enjoy a  windfall. The program will fund vital  investments in a clean energy future,  which I think my friend Mr. INSLEE  may have some thoughts about, $150  billion over the course of the next 10  years. The balance of the auction revenues are to be returned to the people,  especially vulnerable families, communities, and business, to help the transition to the clean energy economy.  You know, there’s a great NRDC blog  that talks about Newt Gingrich’s assertion that climate change will result in  a $1,300 tax per household. And they  point out it’s simply voodoo economics.  First of all, he ignores the value of  the carbon market. It just disappears.

283,64,2009-03-17,Ms. FOXX.," Well, I thank my colleague  from Texas  for starting this  Special Order tonight and giving me a  chance to come down and be you with  you and spend some time talking about  several  different  issues.  I  certainly  agree with you that it is important for  the American people to have faith and  trust in their elected officials. And I  think that there is a great deal of cynicism in this country. And people wonder what can they believe in? I think  that it is important that when they  hear us speaking on the floor, or they  get letters from us, or they have other  means  of  communications  from us,  that they know that we are telling  them the truth.  When I first came here, we had folks  speaking on  the  floor almost every  night. A group of us who were new in  the Congress that year, in 2005, were so  concerned about the things that were  being said that we established a group  called  the  ‘‘Truth Squad.’’ And we  would come down at night after that  group would speak and set the record  straight by giving out what we thought  were true statements. They were often  very  different  from  the  statements  that were being made by our  colleagues. I think it is important that we  do  this on  every occasion, because  frankly, I think in the last 3 years or  so, the American people have really  been sold a bill of goods.  All of us would like to see things  easier, better and less expensive. We  would like to think that life would be  a lot easier than it is. But we have  challenges that we deal with every day.  It is not likely that the government is  going to be able to make our lives easier for us. Yet, that is what has been  sold, I think, to the American people.  We haven’t had the benefit of having a  large segment of the media on our side  in order to be able to counteract some  of those things that were said.  I want to give a little detail, put a  little meat on the bones of some of the  things  that you have been  talking  about in terms of what would this cap-  and-tax plan do to us in the country?  We have been told that everybody making less than $250,000 is not going to be  taxed in this country and that 95 percent of the people are going to get a  tax cut. But let’s talk a little bit again  about the particulars of this. It is actually  $250,000  per  couple.  It  is  not  $250,000 for an individual. It doesn’t exempt small businesses who often are  taxed at the individual rate. So there  are some minor little details in there  in what has been told about taxes and  about the budget that has been presented.  To go to your point about what the  increase in taxes are going to do to the  American people, you are absolutely  right. Every single family is going to  be paying for these ideas that are being  brought up under the guise of  ‘‘scientific knowledge.’’ I don’t know about  you, but I haven’t seen any conclusive  proof presented that the science can  support this. We know that President  Obama himself said, ‘‘under my plan of  a  cap-and-trade  system,  electricity  rates would necessarily skyrocket.’’ So  we know that is going to happen. But  no one has explained to the American  people how that is going to happen.  There was a piece done by FOXNews  just a few days ago, I think somewhere  around March 4, where an energy analyst, Margot Thorning, said: ‘‘In dollar  cost terms, it is probably an additional  $700 to $1,400 per family per year starting around 2012.’’ That is right around  the corner. So what the President says  he is going to give is a tax cut. But  that is going to amount to about $600  to $800, and at the same time, the families are going  to be charged about  $1,400 more in energy costs. So what  the government is going to give, it is  also going to take away.  I think, again, what you’re doing is  great. I have pointed out many times  that the North Carolina State motto is  ‘‘to be, rather than to seem.’’ I have  brought that up several times on the  floor because I think that is what the  American people want out of us here in  Congress.  b2030  The American people don’t want us  to seem rather than to be; and yet  what is being done here in the name of  science and in the name of protecting  us from the climate change that they  believe is occurring is going to be a  pretty expensive trial as to whether or  not this is going to work. And we don’t  know. It is an experiment, really. It is  not proven science. We don’t know that  we are causing global warming with  carbon. We have had global warming  and global cooling even before human  beings were on the Earth.  So I think it is a great thing that you  are doing, to tie programs, budgets,  proposals and policies to this issue of  ethics because they are tied together  and are very important. I want to commend you for doing that.  We have been joined by some of our  very  articulate  colleagues  here  tonight, and I want to give them an opportunity  to  share  their knowledge,  their enthusiasm for this issue.  ",2009
284,64,2009-03-17,Mr. CARTER.," Let me point out, I  have a poster board here. Now some  might think I have been picking on  Chairman RANGEL too much, and  I  don’t intend to do that, but this is to  make my point. Chairman RANGELis in  charge of taxation. That is his job. He  is the tax man of this House.  We have a little quote here from a  real conservative news source we all  love and adore, the New York Times,  January 3, 2009, ‘‘Rangel Pushed for a  Donation;  Insurer Pushed  for a Tax  Cut.’’  It  is  written  by  David  Kocieniewski. ‘‘On April 21, 2008, Representative Charles B. Rangel met with  officials of the American International  Group,  the  now-troubled  insurance  giant, to ask for a donation to a school  of public service that City College of  New York was building in his honor,’’  and I will point out named after him.  ‘‘Mr. Rangel had already helped secure a $5 million pledge for the project  from a foundation controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg, one of the company’s  largest  shareholders  and  its  former chief executive. And CCNY officials, according to the school’s own  records, had high hopes for AIG—a donation of perhaps as much as $10 million.’’  Some may have heard of AIG. It has  been a little bit in the news lately.  Now my point is that is an accusation made by the New York Times, not  by me, not by any Member of this  House. That is an accusation made by  the New York Times that should be resolved because it is about our number  one tax man, and our number one tax  man along with the President of the  United States  is going to be championing the Democrat budget of $3.6  trillion, a number that almost defies  imagination.  We have gotten used to trillions in  the last 60 days because we have seen  lots of  them. They are everywhere.  This administration is throwing trillions  around  like  tennis  balls  at  Wimbledon and we are  sitting here  looking at a new little slight glitch of  $3.6 trillion. I would think that the average American looking at this budget  would  like to know that the people  that designed it and the people that  put  it together shoot straight, deal  ethically with issues. And they would  like to know that, but they have an accusation  from the New York Times  that says contrary to that.  So is there a place to resolve that?  Yes, we have one. It is called the Ethics Committee. But there is no action  out of the Ethics Committee. It just  kind of sits there.  So I guess our famous Rangel rule  which now  is on everybody’s tongue  about special privileges for Mr. RANGEL, I guess we add this to the Rangel  rule. I don’t know what else to do with  it. If you have accusations and the Ethics Committee doesn’t act, then they  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:03 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.118 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
285,71,2009-03-17,Mr. PALLONE.," You’re  absolutely  right. I’m not suggesting that under  the rubric of this reform this year that  we are going to be able to address all  these problems. But it always drives  me crazy that more and more, and I  don’t know what the percentage is, but  more and more of our health care professionals are trained overseas, either  Americans that go overseas to medical  school, or people that we bring here as  immigrants, either nurses or doctors,  because we are not graduating enough  doctors or nurses here in the United  States. I don’t think that that trend  can continue forever.  I give you an example. In my State of  New Jersey, we have a University of  Medicine  in Dentistry that basically  has  three  divisions:  Newark,  New  Brunswick, and down in south Jersey  in Stratford. I think total they graduate—I may be off a little—maybe 700,  800 physicians every year in the State  of New Jersey. We have what, 8 million  people, and we are graduating in our  university system only 700 or 800 physicians per year?  Now, sure, a lot of New Jersey physicians go elsewhere for their education.  But how can you justify that with a  population of 8 million people? I just  find more and more that we are relying  on doctors and nurses that are trained  overseas, and maybe it’s a way for us  to cut costs because we don’t have to  pay for their education or training, and  the other countries do it.  Somehow it seems to me that that  has got to be reversed. And maybe it’s  going to cost more money, but it just  doesn’t make sense to me.  ",2009
286,71,2009-03-17,Mr. SNYDER.,"  It’s  particularly  a  poignant  issue  for you and me, Mr.  PALLONE, as we get older, because a lot  of our doctors are going to be retiring  and we are expecting these generations  coming to take care of this big swell of  the  aging  population  as  the Baby  Boomers retire. So it’s really important.  We are not going to get to where we  want to go though in this process of  doing health care reform and trying to  find ways to save money, which we all  want to do, if we don’t recognize the  cost of medical education.

287,71,2009-03-17,Mr. PALLONE.," The other thing that  I really want to stress, and I haven’t  tonight, and you did touch upon it also,  is new ways of doing things. I mean one  of the things that President Obama did  in this economic recovery package is  that he actually put in pots of money  that would be used to try to change the  way we do things with health care.  So there’s a pot of money for prevention programs, there’s a pot of money  for wellness programs. There are going  to be pilot programs through grants for  what we call comparative effectiveness, where you would actually look at  certain operations or certain procedures or the use of certain drugs to determine whether they are even effective from an economic point of view. It  may cost you more, but are you really  getting anything for your money.  In addition to that, there’s a major  initiative—I think it’s $20 billion—for  health information technology to upgrade doctors’ and hospital offices so  that records and other things are done  electronically.  It’s not just a question of covering  everyone or reducing costs, but it’s a  question of doing things differently, because if a person can go to a general  practitioner on a regular basis and get  a checkup, then it’s a preventive measure that prevents them being hospitalized and costing more money to the  government or to the system later.  I mean  these  really haven’t been  played out much in this economic recovery package. Most of the talk has  been about  infrastructure and transportation and all that. There are major  changes envisioned in the way we look  at health care that the President has  taken the leadership on, and the Congress, too, since we passed this bill.  ",2009
288,71,2009-03-17,Mr. SNYDER.," I think this issue of  the health information technology is  really important. I notice that since  the bill passed and the bill has been increasingly  studied by people  in  the  press  and  policymakers,  that  the  health IT part, the health information  technology piece of that bill, is starting to get a lot more attention.  There’s been articles in the papers in  the last couple of days. Wal-Mart is  starting to look at doing some things.  The challenge—I mean, I’m somebody  who most of my career was working for  doctors who had small practices. And  so there have been hospitals that have  moved in this direction, large practices  have moved in the direction of having  a modern electronic medical record.  The problem has been that most doctors are in small offices of maybe one  to five or six people. When the studies  have been done about what does it take  for that kind of an office to move to an  electronic medical  record,  the kind  that most patients will want, it takes  several months  from  the  time  they  start until it’s where they want to be.  It takes several months to get back  to that same level of efficiency as seeing patients; the installation, learning  the new ways of doing things, just figuring out how to do things.  Now everyone recognizes, even the  ones who don’t have it, that ultimately  it makes it more efficient, it’s safer for  their patient, safer for them because no  doctors want to make mistakes, nurses  don’t want to make mistakes. There’s  nothing worse than having to have a  clerk sit there and Xeroxing medical  records off because you have got a patient that you have had for 40 years  that’s moving across the country. You  can do  it electronically and  it  just  moves things.  I think the money that is in this bill  is really going to motivate both physicians,  physicians’  offices,  the  folks  that manage their practices, but also  those kinds of business people out  there who say, Wait a minute. Here’s a  chance to move America forward, to invest in our health care infrastructure  and, by the way, create some new jobs,  make some money for my business, and  do some good things for the American  people in anticipation of these changes  that I hope will come in our health  care  system  as  part  of  President  Obama’s proposals. So I think that is  very exciting.  I was talking to one of my Republican doctor friends who voted against  the bill. I certainly understand his reasons for voting against the economic  recovery bill. But I said, I want to  know, what do you think about the  health information technology piece?  He said, Oh, I like that. He might quibble with little details of it.  But we have liked the bill before, as  doctors. The problem has been for the  last several years is finding the money  to pay for it, and the opportunity came  along through the stimulus package.  And I think this is a real opportunity  to be a good investment in the change  that our health care system needs. So  I find that very exciting.  I want to say a point about prevention. And I recognize that I am probably in the minority on this view. My  own view is that we ought to not sell  preventive measures, which I think are  so important, but I think we ought to  not sell them or oversell them as ways  to save dramatic amounts of money.  My own view is that prevention is a  quality of life issue. If I can work with  a patient when they’re 25 years old to  get them to stop smoking, I know, I  know their quality of life is going to be  better. I know there are diseases they  are not going to get when they quit  smoking or if they never start smoking  because of good health education programs when they’re 16, 17, and 18.  Now, where I have a problem with  this prevention-saves-money argument  is if somebody lives to be 90, I know at  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:42 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.129 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
289,78,2009-03-17,Mr. SCALISE.," Reclaiming my time,  the gentleman from Texas makes some  wonderful  points. And  I  appreciate  your concern for what happens when  Madison, my daughter, grows up and  what kind of country she is going to be  left with and what kind of debt she is  going to inherit. And I think when the  American people across the country  look at this—and they’ve started to  look at it in, I think, a very close way.  And what they’re telling me when I go  back home, and those of us that have  gone throughout the country to our  districts, they’re telling us that this  budget spends too much and it taxes  too much. And it borrows too much  from future generations at the expense  of our ability to get our economy back  on  track  to help  those  small businesses.  And then they look and they say,  well, what are all of these deficits?  What is all of this spending going toward? And what they see, they see that  first stimulus bill, they look at this  TARP money, they look at what’s happening with that TARP money and AIG  and companies that are getting this  money. In some cases, you can’t even  find out what they did with the money.  And then when you find out what they  did, it makes you even more angry because you see they are giving it in bonuses to people who helped run those  companies into the ground. These are  people who truly would be unemployed  because  they bankrupted  their own  companies, and today the only reason  they have a job is because of these Federal bailouts of these companies. And  then they are using that money—not to  make loans, but something even more  egregious. And as angered as we are  hearing  about  these  bonuses  that  they’re paying—$160 million in bonuses  that AIG paid to  its executives—we  also found out today that AIG used $26  billion of that taxpayer money to give  to French  and German  banks—not  American banks, to help our American  banking system, but $26 billion of that  TARP money went  to German and  French banks, which might be helping  their economies in those countries, but  it sure isn’t helping America. So for  those of us who voted against those  bailouts, saying I told you so doesn’t  help anybody, but saying this madness  has to end.  And people are looking at this. And  then they are seeing the budget that’s  proposed. And  they’re  seeing  these  huge spikes in deficit spending and this  huge amount of new government socializing of different systems and forms  of our economy, and it’s scaring people.  Because when you look at the stock  market, the stock market is an indication not just of what’s happening to  those individual companies, but of consumer confidence. In fact, since this  President took office in January, the  stock market is down about 25 percent.  That means 401(k)s out there, families  who are investing in those markets,  their retirement savings are down over  25 percent just since January 20. We’re  not talking about something that has  been going on  for over a year now,  we’re talking about something that is  maybe 2 months in the making, a 25  percent decrease because people are  seeing  these  plans—these  spending  plans, these tax plans, this massive  borrowing—and  they  are  realizing  somebody has to pay for this.  And what are we doing with this  money? And you can’t even go find it.  It’s not helping our country get back  on track; because, again, if you go back  to the Great Depression—and we said  we are going to talk about this a little  bit—during the Great Depression in the  1930s,  it wasn’t because  they didn’t  spent enough money. They actually  spent money for years and years and  the depression stayed as bad as it was.  For over 8 years they spent money.  And there is an old saying, if you don’t  learn from history, you are doomed to  repeat it.  Back in the 1930s, the budget director,  the Treasury  Secretary  under  FDR, Henry Morgenthau, actually said,  ‘‘We’re  spending  too much money.’’  After 8 years of them spending money,  they were still at double-digit unemployment. We were still in a Great Depression. In fact, some people said we  were  in a  recession  then, and  the  spending brought us into a Great Depression. And FDR’s own Treasury Secretary in the 1930s said it’s the spending that’s giving us all this massive  debt, and it’s not doing anything to  help  our  economy.  It wasn’t until  World War  II that we got back on  track.  And so people are looking at that and  saying, wait a minute; we sure don’t  want to make the mistakes of history’s  past if we learn how we are going to  get  ourselves  out  of  this  problem  today.  If the gentleman has anything else to  add——  ",2009
290,78,2009-03-17,Mr. CARTER.," If the gentleman would  yield for just a moment, because I actually happened to be thinking about  that on my way up here this week.  We are experiencing that rare time  that all Members of Congress who travel back and forth have to deal with  called spring break. And I think that  everybody  that  flew on an airplane  coming up here knows that there were  thousands and  thousands and  thousands of young people going all over  the country and all over Mexico—and  who knows where—on  spring break.  And it reminded me of something that  Will Rogers said during the Great Depression, he said, ‘‘America is a funny  place. We may be the only country in  the world that’s driving to the poor  house in an automobile.’’ The whole  point was, we need to remind ourselves,  as we debate about this issue, that we  are Americans who, if given the right  tools, can incentivize our way out of  any mess we get into.  We are still the most blessed Nation  on the face of the Earth. We need to fix  this banking crisis. And we don’t need  to fix it by indebting our grandchildren  and our great grandchildren with special projects to meet campaign promises that were made. We need to concentrate on the issue, which is getting  credit back in the market. And then  that young man out in the hall and  that young man in Killeen, Texas, can  go borrow their loan from their bank  and go invest it in the future for their  children and grandchildren, and our  country will continue to send all these  beautiful children off on spring break.  I think we realize who we are. We can  do anything we set our mind to if the  government will  just get out of the  way and give us a chance to do it. I  yield back.  ",2009
291,78,2009-03-17,Mr. SCALISE.," Reclaiming my time.  And I thank the gentleman from Texas  for sharing that because that is the  reason that we’re here tonight because  we know that there is a better way,  there is a way out of this problem. And  people across this country know. They  know that we put a man on the moon  because we, as a nation, set our mind  to it and we said we are not going to  accept failure. And so as people look at  these proposals and they look at these  record deficits, they know this is not  the way out. They know that if spending would solve this problem, we would  have the best economy in decades. And  so, clearly, spending and taxing is not  the answer.  But there are proven answers; and  some of those answers are rooted in the  very things we’ve been talking about,  the alternative proposals we’ve been  talking about, ways to help small businesses get back on their feet and hire  more people. The people that employ 70  percent of our workforce  today are  being faced with $640 billion in taxes by  this budget, and obviously that has had  a ripple effect. And we can unravel that  by stopping this from happening.  And people across this country know  that, too. That’s why you are seeing  these tea parties sprout up all across  the country where people are saying,  we are not going to take it anymore,  and we want to stand up and let the  government  know—because  government does answer to the people, especially here in this House, of all places,  the People’s House. So this is the voice  of the people, and we’re trying to express that voice. And another great  voice is my friend from Texas as well,  ",2009

295,92,2009-03-17,Mr. REID.," Madam President, I certainly agree with the Republican leader about AIG. If I were in the AIG administration, I would recommend they  give back those bonuses. Remember,  we as a Congress are not defenseless.  We can also do things. Senator BAUCUS,  chairman of the Finance Committee, is  going to make a proposal that will certainly send a message to the people at  AIG and others who try to benefit from  the hardships  the American  people  face. So in the next 24 hours, you will  hear from the chairman of the Finance  Committee,  Senator  that  AIG’s recipients of these bonuses will  not be able to keep all their money.  That is an understatement.  Also, regarding Guantanamo, I think  we should not make this a political  issue. JOHNMCCAIN has come out in  favor of this. ‘‘I think that it’s a wise  move,’’ MCCAIN said  about  closing  Guantanamo Bay. So this is something  President Obama is not out there alone  on.

300,99,2009-03-17,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, I will  speak on a letter that myself and a  number of colleagues are sending to  the head of AIG, and I believe a few  other colleagues will be here  in the  next half hour to speak on the letter as  well.  I rise today to express my outrage  and the outrage of the American taxpayers  at  the  bonus  payments  the  American International Group intends  to make to the employees of its Financial Products division.  Yesterday, we learned that AIG is in  the process of paying $165 million in  bonuses to the employees of its Financial Products division as part of the  plan that will pay them $450 million in  bonuses by the end of 2009.  This is disgraceful, this is unacceptable, and it is an offense to millions of  hard-working Americans whose  tax  dollars are the only reason AIG continues to exist as a going concern.  Today, I rise to assure you, the leadership of AIG, my fellow Americans,  and my colleagues, that we intend to  do everything in our power to prevent  those payments from being made and  to recoup the money that has already  been paid. As of now, eight of my colleagues and I have joined in a letter to  Edward Liddy, the chairman of AIG,  demanding that he renegotiate these  contracts, and letting him know that  we will not stand by. If Mr. Liddy does  nothing, we will act, and we will take  this money back and return it to its  rightful  owners—the American  taxpayers. We will take this money back  by taxing virtually all of it. So let the  recipients of these large and unseemly  bonuses be warned: If you don’t return  it on your own, we will do it for you.  In the letter, joining me are the majority leader, Senator REID; secretary  of the caucus, Senator MURRAY; Senator KLOBUCHAR; Senator CARPER; Senator LINCOLN; Senator MENENDEZ; Senator JOHNSON; and the occupant of the  chair, Senator BEGICH. The number is  growing, and I believe many other people will put their names on the list.  In the past year, we have  learned  much about the reckless behavior within our financial system. No firm was  more reckless than AIG. What they did  was not only irresponsible but, from a  business perspective, it was immoral.  They took what was a very solid, well-  made business that sold insurance to  individuals and firms around the globe  and turned it into a gambling den that  they used to enrich themselves. They  sold credit default swaps and other derivatives to all comers as though they  were playing with monopoly money,  but  it was real money. When their  deals went sour, when they actually  had to pay, they had nothing with  which to pay anyone.  As Warren Buffet said,  ‘‘When the  tide goes out, you see who is swimming  without a bathing suit on.’’ The leadership of this unit of AIG was doing just  that.  Just this month—in fact, less than 3  weeks ago—AIG reported that in the  final quarter of 2008, as a firm, it lost  $61.7 billion. Let me repeat that. In a  single  quarter—in  just  the  last  3  months of 2008 alone—this  firm  lost  over $60 billion. That is by far the largest single quarterly loss in corporate  history. For all of 2008, AIG lost $99.3  billion, nearly $100 billion. Nearly all of  those losses were caused by the actions  of the employees of the Financial Products  division.  But,  yesterday,  we  learned the firm intended to pay nearly  $165 million in ‘‘bonuses’’ this year and  a total of $450 million in bonuses over  the next year for the employees in the  very same unit—not only bonuses but  performance  bonuses—a  performance  bonus for a firm that lost $100 billion.  I will repeat that. This is a performance bonus for a firm that lost $100 billion. If anything defines ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ business practices, this is it.  It boggles the mind.  In  the past  6 months alone,  the  American taxpayers have been forced  to commit over $170 billion to AIG. If  the Government had not stepped in, if  it had not repeatedly acted to fill the  hole in the financial system created by  this firm and these employees’ behavior, AIG would have been bankrupt. All  these employees would have received  nothing—zero.  We keep hearing that AIG is contractually bound to pay these bonuses; that  if they don’t, these supposedly talented  people—those whose talent created this  disaster—will  leave. Here  is what  I  would like to know from Mr. Liddy:  Did he even attempt to renegotiate  these contracts? Did he approach these  individuals and point out to them the  health of AIG and the condition of the  United States and global economies  and their own culpability in creating  this mess? Did they respond by saying:  I don’t care, I want my bonus? Is that  what Mr. Liddy is suggesting?  Well, Mr. Liddy, I urge you to fix this  mess because, let me tell you something: We are all fed up. If you don’t fix  it, we will.  Here is what we are doing: My colleagues and I are sending a letter to  Mr. Liddy informing him that he can  go right ahead and tell these employees  who are scheduled to get bonuses that  they should voluntarily return them  because, if they don’t, we plan to tax  virtually all of it. He should tell these  employees if they don’t give the money  back, we will put into place a new law  that will allow us to tax these bonuses  at a high rate so it is returned to its  rightful owners—the taxpayers.  For those of you getting these bonuses, be forewarned: You will not be  getting to keep them.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

310,113,2009-03-17,Mr. CASEY.," Madam President, I rise  first to talk about an issue so many of  us have been deeply concerned about—  frankly, beyond  concerned but outraged by—and that  is what  is happening with AIG and the effect of the  decision  the  executives made  there  about bonuses, in relation to our economy. I think it is important to step  back from the obvious frustration we  have. So many Americans are expressing their outrage and anger, and a deep  sense of betrayal has been generated  almost because of this action. I want to  step back  for a  second and  review  where we are.  Basically, what we have is an American company of  international reach  that has said to the American people:  We know you gave us $170 billion, at  last count; you gave us your tax money  because we were in trouble. And we  have to ask them: Why were you in  trouble?  One of the big reasons is because a  group of employees in one division of  AIG developed schemes. That  is the  best word to describe what they developed. These were sophisticated schemes  to make money, which caused the near  collapse of this company. That is what  we are talking about. This isn’t complicated. It is that simple. The employees of that division concocted these  schemes to make money, and now the  company is in near collapse, while the  American people—the American taxpayers—were  asked  through  their  elected representatives, through their  Government, to provide tens of billions  in help—by one count, $170 billion in  help. And what do we get for that? We  got little in the way of accountability  with all these transactions AIG has entered into, very little in the way of accountability, and now we find out this  past weekend that the very division—  not just a broad section of employees  but the very division that concocted  the schemes that led to the problems is  getting tens of millions in bonuses—  $160 million, $165 million in bonuses. So  this is beyond the insult of getting billions and tens of billions and hundreds  of billions in taxpayer help and then  asking for bonuses for anyone. This is  much worse than that. This is giving  bonuses to the people in the very division that caused most, if not all, of the  problems at AIG that taxpayers were  then called upon to provide some remedy or rescue. That is the outrage here.  That is the insult to the American people, that this company now is thumbing its nose at the American people.  This comes at a time when, for example, in Pennsylvania, our employment  rate hit 7 percent. I never thought we  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:26 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17MR6.044 S17MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 7 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2009
311,120,2009-03-17,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will report.  The legislative clerk read as follows:  The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. COBURN]  proposes an amendment numbered 675:  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of eminent domain and to ensure that no American has  their property forcibly taken from them by  authorities granted under this Act)  At the appropriate place, insert the following:  SEC. ll. EMINENT DOMAIN.  Notwithstanding any other provision of  this Act (or an amendment made by this  Act), no land or interest in land (other than  access easements) shall be acquired under  this Act by eminent domain.  ",2009
312,120,2009-03-17,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, that is a  straightforward amendment. The authors of this bill said we are never  going to use eminent domain for any of  this, even though they reference two or  three statutes that give eminent domain. Well, if that is the case, if we are  never going to use eminent domain to  accomplish the purposes of this, there  should be no trouble accepting this  amendment. This amendment just says  we can’t. On this bill, you can’t use  eminent domain to take the property  away from somebody who doesn’t wish  to give their property.  Amendment 5 of the U.S. Constitution says:  No person shall be deprived of life, liberty,  or property without due process of law, nor  shall private property be taken without just  compensation.  That is the Constitution. But the father of the Constitution said it a different way. He said, in a word:  As a man is said to have a right to his  property, he may be equally said to have a  property in his right.  Eminent domain is necessary and appropriate at times in this country for  national defense,  for the health and  well-being of the country, for priorities  that protect the public at large, and  that makes  sense. There are  times  when we have to use it. There is not a  time associated with any of the parts  of this bill that we should have to use  eminent domain.  I have been assured by the authors of  this bill that they have no intention of  using eminent domain. If that is the  case,  then  support  this amendment,  and we will never have a problem with  it. The property rights folks in this  country, of which about 100 support  this amendment, would  say  that  is  great, so let’s vote it up or down.  But if we vote against it, what is it  going to tell them? What it is going to  do  is erode the confidence of  landowners in this country. We say we are  not going to take your land away from  you without your permission, without  there being a willing seller, but we  have kind of a king’s edge. We have our  fingers crossed behind our backs because there may be some time when a  bureaucrat has made a decision other  than what we are saying tonight.  So the way to enforce that would be  a straightforward message that says,  according to this amendment,  ‘‘notwithstanding any other provisions of  this act, or any amendment that  is  made to this act, no land or interest in  land, other than an access easement,  shall be required under this act by eminent domain.’’  That  is straightforward. Let’s give  them confidence that we are not going  to take their land away against their  will.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and  suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

318,120,2009-03-17,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, the Senate will in a couple of weeks take up  the fiscal year 2010 budget. It is a defining document. In many cases, the budget establishes a blueprint for the agenda, what is going to happen in the Congress.  We normally get a budget proposal  from the President, and the Congress  takes it up and acts on it. We have gotten that blueprint from the new administration. The Congress will, as I said,  in a couple of weeks  take up our  version of that budget, put it into legislative form, and take action on it.  I think what most Republicans in the  Senate are going to take issue with in  this budget  is the  fact that  it does  spend too much, tax too much, and borrow too much. We believe the budget as  proposed is going to be very harmful to  the economy at a time when we ought  to be looking at creating jobs. In fact,  this budget could do the exact opposite. It could cost the economy a significant number of jobs because it is  going to impose all kinds of new burdens on that economy.  The first point I would like to make  with respect to the issue of spending  too much—as  I  said,  it  spends  too  much, taxes too much, borrows too  much, but if we look at the amount of  spending in the bill on the surface, discretionary spending would increase by  $725 billion over 10 years. Mandatory  spending would  increase $1.2 trillion  during the same period.  Total spending in this year’s budget  for fiscal year 2010 is $3.9 trillion or 28  percent of our gross domestic product.  That means we would be spending more  as a percentage of our gross domestic  product than at any time since World  War II.  That  is a stunning and staggering  fact when you think about it. At a time  when a  lot of Americans are being  asked to tighten their belts in a difficult economy, this budget grows the  size of Government by 9 percent for  nondefense  programs  in  fiscal year  2010, for a total of 20 percent growth in  these programs since the year 2008.  There has been a lot of talk about revising the history of the past 8 years.  But this budget spends more than the  Bush budget every  single year, and  that is even after adjusting for inflation.  For those on the other side who have  been critical of the overspending on the  Republican side—and I don’t deny the  Republicans spent more than we should  have when we were in control of this  place, but this budget is staggering in  terms of the amount of spending it includes—$3.9 trillion for fiscal year 2010,  and, as I said, 28 percent of GDP, which  would represent the highest  level of  share of GDP at any time in this Nation since World War II.  With respect to the issue of taxes—  and as  I  said,  it  spends  too much  which, obviously, any person who looks  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:08 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17MR6.056 S17MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 7 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2009
319,141,2009-03-17,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  this  week, our Nation celebrates Sunshine  Week—a time to recognize and promote openness in our Government. At  this  important  time of year,  I am  pleased to join with Senator CORNYNto  reintroduce the OPEN FOIA Act—a bipartisan bill to promote more openness  regarding statutory exemptions to the  Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  This bipartisan bill builds upon the  work that Senator CORNYNand I began  several years ago to reinvigorate and  strengthen FOIA. Together, we introduced, and Congress ultimately  enacted, the OPEN Government Act—the  first major reforms to FOIA in more  than a decade. I thank Senator CORNYN  for his work and leadership on this important issue. I also thank President  Obama—who was a cosponsor of the  OPEN Government Act when he was in  the Senate—for his deep commitment  to FOIA. President Obama clearly demonstrated his  commitment  to  open  Government when he issued a new directive to strengthen FOIA during his  first full day in office.  The OPEN FOIA Act simply requires  that when Congress provides for a statutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress must state its intention to do so explicitly and clearly.  This commonsense bill mirrors bipartisan  legislation  that  the Judiciary  Committee favorably reported, and the  Senate unanimously passed, during the  109th Congress, S. 1181. While no one  can fairly question the need to keep  certain Government information secret  to ensure the public good, excessive  Government  secrecy  is  a  constant  temptation and the enemy of a vibrant  democracy.  For more than four decades, FOIA  has served as perhaps the most important Federal law to ensure the public’s  right to know, and to balance the Government’s power with the need for Government accountability. The Freedom  of Information Act contains a number  of exemptions to its disclosure requirements for national security, law enforcement, confidential business information, personal privacy and other circumstances. The FOIA exemption commonly known as  the  ‘‘(b)(3) exemption,’’  requires  that  Government  records that are specifically exempted  from FOIA by statute be withheld from  the public. In recent years, we have  witnessed an alarming number of FOIA  (b)(3) exemptions being offered in legislation—often  in  very  ambiguous  terms—to the detriment of the American public’s right to know.  The bedrock principles of open Government lead me to believe that (b)(3)  statutory exemptions should be clear  and unambiguous, and vigorously debated before they are enacted into law.  Too often,  legislative exemptions to  FOIA are buried within a few lines of  very complex and  lengthy bills, and  these new exemptions are never debated openly before becoming law. The  consequence of this troubling practice  is the erosion of the public’s right to  know, and the shirking of Congress’  duty to  fully consider these exemptions.  The OPEN FOIA Act will help stop  this practice and shine more light on  the process of creating legislative exemptions to FOIA. That will be the  best antidote to the ‘‘exemption creep’’  that we have witnessed in recent years.  When he recently addressed a joint  session of the Congress and the American people, President Obama said that  ‘‘I know that we haven’t agreed on  every  issue thus  far, and there are  surely times in the future when we will  part ways. But, I also know that every  American who is sitting here tonight  loves this country and wants it to succeed. That must be the starting point  for every debate we have in the coming  months, and where we  return after  those debates are done.’’  Sunshine Week reminds all of us that  open Government is not a Democratic  issue, nor a Republican issue. It is an  American issue and a virtue that all  Americans can embrace. Democratic  and Republican Senators alike have  rightly supported and voted  for this  bill in the past. It is in this same bipartisan spirit that I urge all Members to  support this bipartisan FOIA reform  bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be placed in the  RECORD, as follows:  S. 612  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

320,148,2009-03-17,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to introduce the Imported Ethanol  Parity Act of 2009.  This  legislation  is cosponsored by  Senators GREGG, BINGAMAN, COLLINS,  CANTWELLand MARTINEZ.  First, let me explain what this bill  does.  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act instructs the President to lower the secondary ethanol import tariff, so that  tariffs on ethanol are no higher than  the subsidy for blending ethanol into  gasoline.  This would restore parity between  the real tariff faced by imported gasoline and ethanol, which currently compete.  This legislation is necessary because  last year’s Farm Bill shifted the function of ethanol tariffs.  Historically, there has been relative  parity between ethanol subsidies and  ethanol tariffs. The tariffs served to  ‘‘offset’’ domestic subsidies for ethanol  use, thereby preventing imported ethanol  from benefiting  from domestic  subsidies.  But after passage of the Farm Bill,  these tariffs began to serve as a real  barrier to trade.  The Farm Bill maintained the primary 2.5 percent tariff and extended  the secondary tariff for two more years  at $0.54 per gallon, creating a combined  tariff of $0.56 to $0.59 per gallon, depending on  the  sale price. But  the  Farm Bill reduced the ethanol blending  subsidy that these tariffs are intended  to offset to $0.45 per gallon.  This disparity means that an ethanol  importer pays more tariff than he gets  back in subsidy, and parity has been  lost.  Specifically,  an  ethanol  importer  pays $0.11 to $0.14 per gallon of tariff to  the U.S. Treasury that he never gets  back from the ethanol subsidy.  Ethanol  is therefore disadvantaged  when it competes directly with other  imported transportation fuels, such as  gasoline and diesel.  It increases the cost of gasoline in  the United States by making ethanol  more expensive.  It prevents Americans from importing  ethanol made  from  sugarcane.  Sugar ethanol  is the only available  transportation fuel that works in today’s cars and emits considerably less  lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline.  It taxes imported transportation fuel  from our friends in Brazil, India, and  Australia, while oil and gasoline imports  from OPEC  enter  the United  States tax free.  It hinders the emergence of a global  biofuels marketplace  through which  countries with a strong biofuel crop  could sell fuel to countries that suffered drought or other agricultural difficulties in the same crop year. Such a  global market would permit mutually  beneficial trade between producing regions and stabilize both fuel and food  prices.  It makes us more dependent on the  Middle East for fuel when we should be  increasing  the number  of  countries  from whom we buy fuel. When it comes  to  energy  security  for  the United  States, which has less than 3 percent of  proven global oil reserves and 25 percent of demand, we must diversify supply.  Bottom Line: Until the tariff is lowered, the United States will tax the  only fuel it can import that increases  energy  security,  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  lowers  gasoline  prices.  This legislation responds to the Tariff’s defenders.  In 2006  I  introduced  legislation to  eliminate the ethanol tariff entirely,  and in 2007 I cosponsored an amendment to the Energy Bill which would  have eliminated the tariff.  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act is a  different proposal that I believe addresses the concerns of tariff defenders.  The advocates of the $0.54 per gallon  secondary  tariff on ethanol  imports  have always argued that the tariff is  necessary in order to offset the blender  subsidy that applies to the use of all  ethanol, whether  produced  domestically or internationally.  They argue that the ethanol subsidy  exists  to  support American  farmers  who produce ethanol at higher cost  than foreign producers. For instance,  on May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee stated on  the Senate floor that, ‘‘the U.S. tariff  on ethanol operates as an offset to an  excise tax credit that applies to both  domestically produced and  imported  ethanol.’’  On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels  Association stated in a press release:  ‘‘the secondary tariff exists as an offset  to the tax incentive gasoline refiners  receive for every gallon of ethanol they  blend, regardless of the ethanol’s origin.’’  In a letter to Congress dated June 20,  2007, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn Growers Association,  the National  Council  of  Farmer  Cooperatives,  the  National  Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated that the  blender tax credit is available to refiners regardless of whether the ethanol  blended  is  imported or domestic. To  prevent  U.S.  taxpayers  from  subsidizing  foreign  ethanol  companies,  Congress passed an offset to the tax  credit that foreign companies pay in  the form of a tariff.  In 2008, the Renewable Fuels Association’s Executive Director asserted that  ‘‘The tariff is there not so much to protect the  industry but the U.S. taxpayer.’’  I ask tariff advocates to either support this legislation or explain how a  tariff can justifiably be higher than the  subsidy it is designed to offset.  Bottom Line: Ethanol from Brazil or  Australia should not have to overcome  a trade barrier that no drop of OPEC  oil must face. The tariffs cannot be justifiably maintained at $0.56–$0.59 per  gallon if its intent is to offset a $0.45  per  gallon  blender  subsidy,  and  it  should be reduced.  Climate Change is the most significant environmental challenge we face,  and I believe that lowering the ethanol  tariff will make it less expensive for  the United States to combat global  warming.  Here  is how: the  fuel we burn to  power our cars is a major source of the  greenhouse gas emissions warming our  planet. In California, it accounts for 40  percent of all of our emissions. To reduce this impact, we need to increase  the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and  lower the lifecycle carbon emissions of  the fuel itself.  For this reason, in the 110th Congress  I introduced the Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act with Senators OLYMPIASNOWE  and SUSANCOLLINS.  The legislation proposed a ‘‘Low Carbon Fuels Standard,’’ which would require each major oil company selling  gasoline in the United States to reduce  the average  lifecycle greenhouse gas  emissions per unit of energy in their  gasoline by 3 percent by 2015 and by 3  percent more in 2020.  This concept became a major aspect  of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, in which Congress requires oil companies to use an increasing quantity of  ‘‘advanced biofuels’’  that produce at least 50 percent less  lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline.  Unfortunately the ethanol tariff puts  a trade barrier in front of the lowest  carbon fuel available, making it considerably more  expensive  for  the  United States to  lower the  lifecycle  carbon  emissions  of  transportation  fuel.

Pebblebrook High School Performing Arts  Chamber Choir was selected out of dozens of  high school choirs across the country for this  performance. The concert will feature 200 students from four states, and is the capstone of  Carnegie Hall’s yearlong National High School  Choral Festival. The concert will be conducted  by Dr. Craig Jessop, esteemed Director of the  Utah State University Music Department and  former director of  the Mormon Tabernacle  Choir, who has been working with the choirs  and  their  conductors  throughout  the  year.  Apart  from  their world-renowned  performances, Carnegie Hall brings innovative music  education programs to students across the nation. I am delighted that these young constituents have been given this opportunity.  Led by George Case, the Pebblebrook High  School Performing Arts Chamber Choir performs works from all periods of classical music  with a strong emphasis on 20th- and 21st-century compositions with a  focus on choral/orchestral masterworks. The Choir has shared  the stage with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Cobb Symphony Orchestra, and has  entered numerous competitions and adjudications at which they have consistently received  superior ratings and awards. Choir members  are actively involved in extracurricular performances and are given the opportunity to work  with top professionals in the arts from the Atlanta area and throughout the United States.  I am honored  to have one of  the  four  schools in the nation chosen for the Carnegie  Hall National High School Choral Festival residing in my Georgia district. They should be  proud not only of their musical achievement,  but  their embodiment of  the quality musical  education  the State of Georgia provides.  I  commend these students and their leaders for  their success, and wish them the best of luck  on March 20 when they perform at Carnegie  Hall.

For the past thirty years, attorneys Tim Collins and Thomas Scanlon have organized the  St. Patrick’s Day Party and Parade—a joyous  event that brings people together in the heart  of Cleveland. This treasured event promotes  and preserves the rich traditions of their beloved Irish homeland. As in years past, downtown Cleveland will once again spring to life  as a sea of green and the spirited sound of  drums and bagpipes wind their way along Euclid Avenue. This enchanted day promises old  friendships  renewed,  the discovery of new  ones, and  the spirit of all  those  joining  together to celebrate Irish culture.  Justice Sean Ryan studied in Dublin at University College and at Dublin & King University  where he studied law. After being called to the  Bar in 1972, Justice Ryan practiced as junior  counsel in the South Eastern Circuit of Ireland  until 1983, when he was appointed to Senior  Counsel. For  the next  twenty years, Justice  Ryan worked diligently in Ireland’s High Court  and Supreme Court on a wide range of cases  and issues, including constitutional law, law of  torts,  criminal  law  and  administrative  law.  Since 2001, Justice Ryan has focused his energy and expertise on investigating cases of  child abuse and working as an advocate for  victims of child abuse.  Madam Speaker and Colleagues, please  join me  in honor and recognition of Justice  Sean Ryan, as we welcome him to Cleveland  on St. Patrick’s Day. Please also join me in  recognition of Tim Collins and Thomas Scanlon for organizing this wondrous St. Patrick’s  Day Celebration again this year, as they have  for  the  past  thirty  years.  ‘‘Ni  dheanfaidh  smaoineamh an treabhadh duit—You’ll never  plough a field by turning it over in your mind’’  Old Irish Proverb.  f  A TRIBUTE TO TRACYE RAWLS-  MARTIN  HON.

Tracye Rawls-Martin, MS ATC is a Certified  Athletic Trainer and one of 5 African American  Athletic Training Education Program Directors  in the United States. She is ‘‘mother’’, advisor  and professor to more than 16 Athletic Training Students within  the BS/MS Degree Program in Athletic Training & Sports Sciences at  Long Island University Brooklyn Campus. She  began her academic career as a Dance Education major and progressed to a Pre-Physical  Therapy major and fell in love with an Athletic  Training major. After completing  two semesters in the Pre-Physical Therapy program at  Kingsborough Community College, she decided it was time to move on to a more exciting and productive field—the field of Athletic  Training and Sports Sciences. The  field of  Athletic Trainers was made for her because it  is designed for Health Care Professionals who  specialize  in prevention, assessment,  treatment and  rehabilitation of  injuries and  illnesses that occur to athletes and the physically active. All Certified Athletic Trainers  must have at least a bachelor’s degree in athletic training, which is an allied health profession, must pass a comprehensive exam before  earning the ATC credential, must keep knowledge and skills current by participating in continuing education and must adhere to standards of professional practice set by a national  certifying agency.

324,295,2009-03-17,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay  tribute  to a championship  team  from  Harrisburg, Illinois.  On February 18, the Harrisburg Junior Bulldogs beat previously-undefeated Carlyle 52–  43 to clinch the 2009 Southern Illinois Junior  High School Athletic Association Class L state  championship. Finishing with a record of 26–  1, the Junior Bulldogs gave Harrisburg Middle  School  its  first state championship  in boys  basketball.  Facing a strong, talented opponent, the Junior Bulldogs stayed cool under pressure, held  off a late rally and then came from behind to  seal  the win. This year’s  team exemplifies  teamwork. As Coach Kevin Dowdy  told  the  local newspaper, ‘‘Everyone had their part.’’  I want to congratulate Coach Dowdy and his  assistant coach, Marcus Questelle, on  their  fine work with this group of student athletes. I  also want to extend my congratulations to the  members of the 2008–2009 Harrisburg Junior  Bulldogs state championship boys basketball  team:  Tyler Smithpeters, Capel Henshaw,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:56 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A17MR8.022 E17MRPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

327,1,2009-03-30,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker,  as we approach health care reform,  there is no area that is more vital for  honest discussion and careful analysis  than what happens at end of a patient’s  life. For most of us, we will get the majority of our lifetime health care in  that last year. Indeed, for many it is  just the last few months of life, we use  the most doctor care, the most intervention  in  terms of medical procedures, the most days in a hospital. This  is clearly the time of greatest stress  both for the patient and the family as  they watch their loved one enter what  is often a struggle in these last few  months.  The evidence is that this is the hardest period to be able to make those  critical decisions. We don’t want to  force  spur-of-the-moment  action  for  families when they are talking about  things that have great consequence for  the quality of life for not just a ‘‘patient’’ but a family member, the ability to extend the quality of life, and  perhaps deal with recovery. This is also  the worst time  for people to go on  autopilot check out, to have a default  option where they just turn decisions  over to whatever the local medical activity may be on that site without a  thought and consequence to what the  individual wishes of the patient and  their family may be.  There  is  strong  evidence  that  in  many cases the very intensive activities—the tubes, the procedures, the operations,  the  ventilators—actually  don’t prolong life, and they certainly  impact in a negative sense the quality  of life, the way that the patient may be  able to interact with their family and  friends in those last few days and their  mind-set and their pain level.  This  research has  sparked  action  from coast to coast. Many States have  developed a new end-of-life care directive called Orders For Life Sustaining  Treatment. They are being developed  in over 30 States. They help the seriously ill patient identify their treatment preferences using clear, standardized language. It is written as actionable medical orders signed by a physician, and they help communicate patient preferences regarding the intensity of medical intervention, transfers  to hospitals, use of antibiotics, artificially administered nutrition and resuscitation.  Members of my family and I have  concluded that we don’t want those extraordinary measures as our default,  and have signed  instructions accordingly.  What we find, however, is that too  many people don’t have access to the  counseling and activities for them to  be able to make an informed decision.  The irony is that the Medicare system  will spend thousands and thousands of  dollars on  intense medical  intervention,  intense medical activities, but  they won’t spend a few dollars to pay a  doctor to have a conversation with a  patient and the family about what they  can expect, what their choices are, and  to be able to engage with the patient  and the  family to decide what they  want to have happen.  I guess that we don’t do it to save  money; but the evidence suggests that  when people actually have a choice,  they choose things that not only improve their quality of life, but actually  save money. Why don’t we give individual patients and their families that  choice under Medicare?  That’s why I will be introducing the  Life Sustaining Treatment Preferences  Act which will provide coverage under  Medicare  for consultations regarding  end-of-life  treatment  options.  It  is  time for Medicare to be able to address  the needs that will truly reflect the  preferences, the wishes, and the quality-of-life choices for Medicare patients  and their families. It is the humane,  compassionate thing to do. It will help  us allocate our health care resources  more appropriately to treat what people want, and it will relieve the pressure on the health care system so the  default isn’t always the most intensive,  expensive interventions that often deteriorate the quality of life in those  final days.  I would urge my colleagues to look at  this option and join me in making sure  that we modernize Medicare to meet  the needs of patients and their families  in their final hours.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

331,8,2009-03-30,Ms.  KIRKPATRICK  of  Arizona.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the Speaker for allowing me  the opportunity  to address  the bill  I sponsored—H.R.  1513,  ‘‘The  Veterans’’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of  2009.’’  Many of my constituents in Greater Arizona  are hurting, and the Nation’s economy, while  showing some signs of improvements, still has  a long road to a full recovery.  No one feels this pressure or deserves the  support of a grateful Nation more than our disabled Veterans.  Our Nation’s veterans have made costly  sacrifices  to ensure  the safety of America’s  families. For that reason, our country provides  both compensation payments  to service-disabled Veterans and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits to the survivors of  servicemembers who die in service to our Nation.  However, without this bill, these payments  would not keep up with rising prices for everyday items like gas and groceries.  That’s why, on behalf of the over 3 million  veterans nationally—including 65,000  in my  home state of Arizona—who are currently receiving disability compensation,  I am asking  you to join me in support of this bill.  This bill keeps the promise to our Nation’s  veterans  to honor  the sacrifice  that  these  brave men and women have endured while  serving our country in uniform.  ",2009

RES. 223  Whereas Paul Harvey, a son, brother, husband,  father,  friend, pioneering American,  and a cherished voice, passed away on February 28, 2009;  Whereas Paul Harvey Aurandt was born on  September 4, 1918, in Tulsa, Oklahoma;  Whereas prefacing a storied career in radio  by making radio receivers as a young boy  and a fill-in announcer while a student at  the University of Tulsa, he epitomized American values and American ideals proving that  one can lead a decent life with hard work  and solid values;  Whereas Paul Harvey, through open expression,  pioneered  the  format  of  radio  broadcasts that so many now find commonplace;  Whereas Paul Harvey was a blogger before  it was a known medium, he  just did his  blogging on the radio;  Whereas Paul Harvey was elected to the  National Association of Broadcasters Radio  Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Hall of Fame  and appeared on the Gallup poll list of America’s most admired men;  Whereas in 2005, Paul Harvey was awarded  the Presidential Medal  of Freedom,  the  United States’ most  prestigious  civilian  award, by President George W.

338,8,2009-03-30,Mr. LYNCH.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  JOHN  TOWNS SULLIVAN,  Madam Speaker, it is with profound  honor that I rise in support of House  Resolution 223, which celebrates the  life of legendary radio and television  personality, Paul Harvey.  I’d first like to thank my colleague  from Oklahoma, Congressman  for  sponsoring  this afternoon’s condolence measure, which has  amassed over 60 cosponsors here in the  Congress  since  being  introduced  on  March 9, 2009.  I’d  also  like  to  thank Chairman  from Brooklyn and my  colleagues on the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee  for  their unanimous support  in bringing  this resolution to the floor.  We live in an age of unprecedented  access to the news. Between the 24-  hour  cable news networks and  the  Internet, there’s no shortage of sources  from which citizens are informed.  Most of us remember a different time  when Americans relied on a small number of outlets for each day’s events. Before everybody had a blog, we placed  our trust in a few individuals to represent the voice of the average citizen.  And I am proud to say that Paul Harvey was certainly one of those trusted  individuals.  There  is no greater  testament  to  Paul  Harvey’s  distinguished  career  than  its  longevity. He was no more  than a teenager when he first hit the  airwaves, reading advertisements and  news clips. After studying speech and  literature at the University of Tulsa,  Oklahoma, Mr. Harvey worked at radio  stations across the American heartland.  In 1941, Mr. Harvey sacrificed his personal aspirations in order to defend our  country. He was a reporter in Hawaii  during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and  decided to enlist in the United States  Army immediately following.  Upon conclusion of his national service, Paul Harvey set about redefining  what it meant to be a radio host by delivering news in his own unique and  humble way. Paul Harvey was never  afraid of controversy, and he was not  one to forfeit his principles. His style  was part journalist, part showman and,  fortunately  for America, part everyman.  As many as 22 million people tuned  in daily to hear Mr. Harvey give his  take on the day’s news. Perhaps it was  his  plain-spoken  ability  to  connect  with and reassure the American people  that made him so popular. Consider  this remark, which is as relevant today  as it was when first spoken. ‘‘In times  like these, it helps to recall that there  have always been times like these.’’  Paul Harvey was constantly recognized for his achievements, both as a  broadcaster and as an outstanding citizen. He received accolades from the  State of Oklahoma, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Salvation  Army, the United States Air Force,  The Humane Society and the American  Legion, just to name a few.

341,15,2009-03-30,Mr. SCALISE.," I want to thank the  Speaker and the gentleman from Nebraska.  I rise  in support of H.R. 1246, the  Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2009. This legislation was  introduced  by  Representative  CAPPSand was passed by the House last  Congress. The bill reforms the Public  Health Service Act and reauthorizes  the newborns and infants hearing loss  program.  Not only does the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act reach out  to cover more children, but it also provides  the Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services the ability to assist in  recruitment, retention, education, and  training  of  qualified  personal  and  health care providers. These qualified  health care providers will provide children, who have been  identified with  hearing loss through screening and detection, with adequate follow-up care.  In an effort to foster research and development in the area of early hearing  detection and intervention, H.R. 1246  requires the director of the National  Institutes of Health to establish a post-  doctoral fellowship program. This program is intended to provide more information on how to better the lives of  children through early intervention.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1246.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
342,15,2009-03-30,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. CAPPS), the sponsor of this  legislation, and I don’t need to tell  anyone how hard she works on this and  so many health bills. She is the vice  chair of our Health Subcommittee.  ",2009
343,15,2009-03-30,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman of our subcommittee, Mr.  PALLONE, for giving me time to speak.  LOIS  Of course, I’m speaking in strong support of H.R. 1246, the Early Hearing Detection and  Intervention Act.  I am  very proud to have introduced this bill  with my colleague, Congresswoman Jo  Ann Emerson of Missouri.  I want to commend the leadership of  the Hearing Health Caucus, Congressman VERNEHLERSand Congresswoman  CAROLYNMCCARTHY, our leaders of this  caucus now, and I must also mention  the work of former Congressman Jim  Walsh of New York who had championed this issue for many years before  his retirement.  As our chairman mentioned, each  year more than 12,000 infants are born  with hearing loss. If left undetected,  this condition impairs speech development, language development, and cognitive development. Back in 2000, we  developed the early hearing detection  program, thanks to the hard work of  the Hearing Health Caucus, and since  that time, we’ve seen a tremendous increase in the number of newborns who  are now being  screened  for hearing  loss.  Back  in  2000, only  44 percent of  newborns were being screened for hearing loss. That’s less than half of the babies  born.  Now,  we’re  screening  newborns at a rate of over 93 percent.  So this legislation has had an impact.  Again, I commend the work of those  made  it happen and all of the hard  work of our colleagues here in Congress  and the Senate and the signing into  law.  But we know now that our work is  not done. According to the Centers for  Disease Control, almost half of  the  newborns who fail initial screening of  their hearing do not go on to receive  appropriate follow-up care, and we need  to train more health professionals with  the skills necessary to provide effective intervention.  As a school nurse for over 20 years, I  had a lot of interaction with students  who were lagging behind their classmates,  failing  in  class  due  to  undiagnosed or untreated hearing loss.  We can prevent more children from suffering in the classroom and really suffering throughout their lives through  better investment in follow-up intervention as a part of the successful  hearing  screening  program  for  newborns and infants.  I urge our colleagues to join in voting in favor of H.R. 1246.  ",2009

This bill addresses the problem of abuse of this drug, particularly  by teenagers and young adults.  DXM, as it is called, is an ingredient  commonly  found  in over-the-counter  cough medications. When taken as directed, there are hardly any side effects. However, this ingredient is often  abused, particularly by teenagers and  young adults, and can result in devastating health effects.  The bill amends the Food, Drug and  Cosmetic Act to restrict the distribution, possession, and receipt of unfinished DXM to entities registered with  the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  I want to thank my colleague Representative UPTON for his work on this  important bill, and I urge us to pass  this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
359,22,2009-03-30,Mr. SCALISE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  favor of H.R. 1259, and I would like to  thank Mr. UPTONof Michigan and Mr.  LARSENof Washington for their work  on this important legislation.  Dextromethorphan, or DXM as it is  sometimes  called,  is  an  ingredient  found in cough medicine. This ingredient relieves the coughing associated  with a cold or the flu. Cough medicines  containing this drug are common and  can be obtained without a prescription.  While this drug can be safe and effective if used as directed, it can also be  dangerous  if  taken  improperly. The  abuse of this drug can cause death as  well as other serious adverse effects  such as brain damage, seizure, loss of  consciousness, and irregular heartbeat.  This legislation would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to prohibit the distribution of DXM  that is in bulk form to any person not  registered with the FDA. It is hoped  that these restrictions on the distribution of DXM will lower the potential  for its abuse while at the same time  protecting access to these needed medications.

361,29,2009-03-30,Mr. PASCRELL.," I was pleased to introduce  the Vision Care  for Kids Act with my colleagues Congressmen GREEN, SULLIVAN, and  ENGELand Congresswoman ROS-LEHTINEN in  both this Congress and in the previous Congress. This important legislation will establish  a federal grant program to provide for timely  diagnostic examination, treatment, and follow-  up vision care  for children, which will complement existing State programs and allow  eye exams  for a vulnerable pediatric population  that do not qualify  for Medicaid or  SCHIP and do not have access  to private  health insurance.  This issue has long been near to my heart.  In fact, in 2003, I first championed legislation  to create a grant program  to provide comprehensive eye exams and necessary follow-  up care  for children whose  families do not  have the resources for or access to such care.  Preventive vision care is critically important to  avoid vision loss, and even blindness, in our  nation’s children, which can affect a child’s  physical, emotional, and  intellectual development.  The CDC states that approximately 1.8 million children under the age of 18 are blind or  have some form of visual impairment. Fortunately,  in most cases, vision  loss can be  avoided with early diagnosis and  treatment.  Eye health has a direct impact on learning and  achievement, and unfortunately, many visual  deficits are caught only after  they have  impaired a child’s early and most critical education. Consequently, it is a national disgrace  that only one in three children receive preventive vision care before they are enrolled in elementary school.  This essential  legislation will provide  the  tools to significantly mitigate the effects of visual impairment. In fact, H.R. 577 has the potential to open up a new world of academic  and social opportunity for approximately half a  million of our youngest children nationwide. As  Congress continues  its work  to  improve  the  health  care  and  educational  opportunities  available to children in this country, the need  to  remove outside  impediments  to  learning  must be addressed to achieve long-term success.  I would like to thank Chairman WAXMANand  Chairman PALLONE, for their thoughtful consideration and support for preventive vision care  for children, and I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of the Vision Care for Kids Act. Finally, I encourage the Senate to expeditiously  consider  this essential  legislation  to provide  necessary vision care to our nation’s most vulnerable children.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 577 ‘‘Vision Care for  Kids Act of 2009.’’  I want  to  thank my colleague Congressman GENEGREEN of Texas  for introducing this legislation.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  tell my colleagues that our nation’s children are our future. They should be the center of all of our  legislative efforts  to  improve  the  lives of all  Americans.  The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2009 is a  necessary grant program aimed at bolstering  children’s vision  initiatives  in  the states and  encouraging new community-based children’s  vision partnerships. This  legislation amends  the Public Health Service Act to authorize the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award  matching grants to states to complement existing state efforts to: (1) provide comprehensive  eye examinations from a licensed optometrist  or ophthalmologist for children who have been  previously identified through a vision screening  or eye examination by a licensed health care  provider or vision screener as needing such  services, who do not otherwise have coverage  for vision services, and who are low-income  children, with priority given to children who are  under the age of nine years; (2) provide treatment or services as necessary to correct identified vision problems; and  (3) develop and  disseminate to parents, teachers, and health  care practitioners educational materials on  recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.  We used to hold our child’s hands when our  child takes their first step. However, not many  help our children  to  learn how  to use  their  eyes properly, how to see properly, and how  to relax their eyes and protect their vision. Today’s education system requires our children  to give close attention, read many books, add  or subtract numbers or operate a computer for  hours. Therefore,  it  is  important  to  learn  to  guide our children to attain good child vision  health at various stages of their development.  Ten million children suffer from vision disorders,  according  to  the National Parent  Teacher Association. Vision disorders are considered the fourth most common disability in  the United States, and  they are one of  the  most  prevalent  handicapping  conditions  in  childhood. According to data from the Making  the Grade: An analysis of state and  federal  children’s vision care policy research study, 32  states require vision screenings for students,  but 29 of them do not require children who fail  the screening to have a comprehensive eye  examination. Because up to two-thirds of children who fail vision screenings do not comply  with recommended eye exams, many children  enter school with uncorrected vision problems.  Undetected and untreated vision deficiencies,  particularly in children, can take a large toll.  Studies have shown that the costs associated  with adult vision problems in the U.S. are at  $51.4 billion.  Undiagnosed and untreated vision problems  for children are serious  issues. Vision problems can affect a child’s cognitive, emotional,  neurological and physical development. While  vision disorders are  considered  the  fourth  most common disability in the United States,  two-thirds of all children entering school have  never received a vision test. For the one-third  of children who do receive a vision test, approximately 40–67 percent who fail the test do  not receive the recommended follow-up care.  I urge my colleagues to support the Vision  Care for Kids Act of 2009 so that we can protect our children of America.  ",2009

376,36,2009-03-30,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.," The  Clerk will report the resolution.  The Clerk read as follows:  H. RES. 295  Whereas, The Hill reported that a prominent lobbying firm specializing in obtaining  defense earmarks for its clients, the subject  of a ‘‘federal investigation into potentially  corrupt political contributions,’’ has given  $3.4 million in political donations to no less  than 284 members of Congress.  Whereas, multiple press reports have noted  questions related to campaign contributions  made by or on behalf of the firm; including  questions related to ‘‘straw man’’ contributions, the reimbursement of employees for  political giving, pressure on clients to give, a  suspicious pattern of giving, and the timing  of donations relative to legislative activity.  Whereas, Roll Call has taken note of the  timing of contributions from employees the  firm and its clients when it reported that  they  ‘‘have provided thousands of dollars  worth of  campaign  contributions  to key  Members in close proximity to legislative activity, such as the deadline for earmark request letters or passage of a spending bill.’’  Whereas, CQ Today specifically noted a  Member getting  ‘‘$25,000 in campaign contribution money from [the founder of the  firm] and his relatives right after his subcommittee approved  its  spending bill  in  2005.’’  Whereas, the Associated Press noted that  Members  received campaign contributions  from employees of the firm ‘‘around the time  they requested’’ earmarks for companies represented by the firm.  Whereas, the Associated Press highlighted  the ‘‘huge amounts of political donations’’  from the firm and its clients to select members and noted that ‘‘those political donations have followed a distinct pattern: The  giving is especially heavy in March, which is  prime time for submitting written earmark  requests.’’  Whereas, clients of the firm received at  least three hundred million dollars worth of  earmarks in fiscal year 2009 appropriations  legislation, including several that were approved even after news of the FBI raid of the  firm’s offices and Justice Department investigation into the firm was well known.  Whereas,  the Associated Press  reported  that ‘‘the FBI says the investigation is continuing, highlighting the close ties between  special-interest spending provisions known  as earmarks and the raising of campaign  cash.’’  Whereas, the persistent media attention  focused on questions about the nature and  timing of campaign contributions related to  the firm, as well as reports of the Justice Department conducting research on earmarks  and campaign contributions, raise concern  about the  integrity of Congressional proceedings and the dignity of the institution.  Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, that (a) the  Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,  or a subcommittee of the committee designated by the committee and its members  appointed by  the  chairman and  ranking  member, shall immediately begin an investigation into the relationship between the  source and timing of past campaign contributions to Members of the House related  to the raided  firm and earmark requests  made by Members of the House on behalf of  clients of the raided firm.  (b) The Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct shall submit a report of its findings  to the House of Representatives within 2  months after the date of adoption of the resolution.  ",2009

383,43,2009-03-30,Mr. BURTON  of  Indiana.," Madam  Speaker, my good friend Mr. POE of  Texas and I are down here almost every  night,  talking  about  our  concerns  about the country, and tonight is no  exception. I want to compliment my  colleague for his learned comments. I  really appreciate his being down here  with me. Sometimes it gets lonely.  I think the thing that concerns me  the most, which is the reason I am here  tonight,  is that  I think America  is  heading toward a socialist-type government, and it really worries me because,  throughout our history, we have been a  free enterprise government, a free enterprise  society, and we have done  very, very well. This country has been  the greatest economic country in the  history of the world because of free enterprise, and now we see, day in and  day out, a movement toward more and  more government control over the private sector.  We have seen the huge bailout of AIG  and  of  other  financial  institutions.  Trillions of dollars are being put into  these institutions along with government control, and that is not what this  country is all about. These companies  that are failing should go through the  bankruptcy procedure, as has been the  case throughout history, and because  of this procedure, this legal procedure,  the free enterprise system has had its  ups and downs, but it has flourished  year in and year out, decade in and  decade out because the system works.  Now we see they are moving toward  the control of the health industry. In  the budget that we are going to be discussing this week, we are going to have  about $680 billion as a down payment  on a socialized medicine system, and  that, once again, is government control  over the health care of this country.  Government control over, as my colleague said tonight, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac and other  institutions,  really has not proven to be too successful, and yet we are going to have the  government taking over and socializing  medicine in this country. It has not  worked in Europe. It has not worked in  other parts of the world. It is not going  to work here. It is going to end up rationing health care, and the people who  are going to be hurt the most are senior citizens in this country, who will be  put at the back of the line.  So it has not worked in the private  sector as far as financial institutions  are  concerned.  It  has  not worked  throughout the world when we have socialized medicine, and now we see that  the government is moving toward control  over  the  automobile  industry.  They are forcing the people out of leadership positions, like the president of  General Motors. Now, maybe he should  have been replaced, but we certainly do  not need the government coming  in  and  telling  the  private  sector,  the  automobile industry, how to run itself.  They should have gone through Chapter 11 in the first place, General Motors  and Chrysler,  instead of the government of this country and the administration putting $14 billion to $15 billion  into those companies which were failing. If they had gone through the bankruptcy procedure, we would not be facing right now another $20 billion or $30  billion of  taxpayers’ money  that  is  going to have to be put into those institutions.  So, tonight, I would just like to protest once again, one Member of Congress talking about the movement toward government control over every  part of our lives. Socialism does not  work. It is a repressive form of government, and it is something that is going  to hurt everybody in this country, that  plus the inflation that is going to be  caused by these trillions of dollars that  we are printing, these moneys that we  are printing. It is going to hurt the future generations of this country.  I listen to Sean Hannity and I listen  to Rush Limbaugh and I listen to Mr.  Beck, the so-called conservative right-  wing radicals. In my opinion, they are  the ones who really understand the direction this country is heading.  I  just hope  the American people,  Madam Speaker, would listen and pay  attention, because I think they don’t  realize how quickly we are moving toward  complete  government  control  over our lives. It is something that we  ought to all be concerned about. I am  concerned about it, and I hope my colleagues who may be paying attention  back  in  their offices are concerned  about it as well.  f  ",2009

400,78,2009-03-30,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  today I am rising to talk about an  issue that has captivated my constituents in the State of Alaska. We have  got a mountain that is erupting. Mount  Redoubt, which  is  located about 150  miles  southwest  of Anchorage,  our  largest  community,  has  been more  than active in the past week or so generating a great deal of press, a great  deal of  interest, and a considerable  amount of impact in my State. So I  wanted to take a  few minutes this  afternoon to talk about what is happening up North, talk a little bit about  the importance of volcano monitoring.  I think we are all aware that there  have been some recent comments made  about Federal  spending  for volcano  monitoring, and the suggestion that  perhaps this might be wasteful money  in that we do not have any need to be  monitoring volcanos.  I can assure you that monitoring volcanos is critically important to the Nation, to the world, and particularly to  Alaska right now, where, as I say, we  are being held hostage by a volcano.  A little bit of a personal note here.  This afternoon—my boys’ spring break  concluded last evening. We have been  up in the State enjoying spring skiing.  And they are grounded by Mount Redoubt. They may be home Wednesday  evening. Now, others might think this  is a bad thing, but  for these young  pages here this morning, when you are  17 and you are shut out of school for an  additional 3 days after spring break  concludes, and you have to stay  in  Alaska and keep skiing, maybe the volcano is not a bad thing.  But there is a very serious aspect to  what we are talking about. Mount Redoubt has erupted 17 times now since  March 22. And when it was initially  under watch, you would see the steam  and the haze coming off the volcano.  But then we started to see some pretty  significant eruptions, eruptions  that  would go 65,000 feet up into the air.  This is a picture of Mount Redoubt.  This was actually taken back in 1989,  the last time Mount Redoubt was active. But what happens is these plumes  go straight up into the air, get caught  by the jet stream at 40- or 65,000 feet,  and then that ash is dispersed throughout the State.  What we have been seeing up North  this week, and actually for about the  past 10 days, is the cancellation of air  flights, complete closure of the Anchorage International Airport over the  weekend. Alaska Airlines alone has  canceled about 230 flights. It has affected about 10,000 passengers, including my boys.  What is happening as a result of this  volcano does become quite personal.  We have school districts down in the  southern part of the State where they  have  experienced  the  ash  fall-out,  where the students have dust masks,  respirator masks  so  they  are  not  breathing  the  ash  that  is  coming  through.

403,85,2009-03-30,Mr. CONRAD.," Madam President, we  have heard a lot of concern this afternoon about deficits and debt and spending from our colleagues on the other  side. I wish to remind them of a little  of the history of what brought us here.  This is what happened with spending  when they were  in charge—spending  about doubled in the Bush administration. Of course, we know the debt more  than doubled, and we are left with an  ocean of red ink.  That is what this administration inherited. This wasn’t President Obama’s  doing. This  is what he walked  into.  Here is what happened to the debt and  the deficit under the previous administration. They actually inherited substantial surpluses, which they rapidly  turned  into record deficits and then  plunged the thing right off the cliff. If  we are going to be fair about how we  got here, I think the other side is going  to have to accept an awful lot of responsibility. Here is what happened to  the debt—it more than doubled, from  $5.8 trillion in 2001 to $12.1 trillion in  2009.  Senator GREGG, the ranking Republican on the committee, said: I am willing to accept this short-term deficit  number, not debate it, because we are  in a recession and it is necessary for  the Government to step in and be aggressive, and the Government is the  last source of  liquidity. So you can  argue that this number, although horribly large, is something we will simply  have to live with.  That is the ranking member of the  Budget Committee. Look, I think he is  entirely right. The hard reality is we  have no choice but to accept, in the  short-term, these large deficits as the  Government seeks to provide liquidity  to prevent an all-out collapse. But over  time, this budget brings the spending  down.  I am not  talking about  the  President’s budget now. I am talking  about the budget I have presented here.  We  take  the  budget—total  discretionary spending—from 9.5 percent of  GDP in 2010 down to 7.3 percent of GDP  in the fifth year.  When you distinguish between defense  and  nondefense  discretionary,  what you see is that I am bringing  them both down at about an equivalent  rate. So defense, in 2010, will be 4.8 percent of GDP; at the end of the 5 years  of this budget, it will be down to 3.7  percent of GDP. Similarly, nondefense  discretionary will be  4.7 percent of  GDP in 2010, and we take that to 3.6  percent of GDP in 2014.  On the discretionary accounts, which  is about one-third of all Federal spending,  on  the  discretionary  accounts,  both defense and nondefense,  I am  bringing them both down as a share of  our national income and doing it in  about the same proportion.  We are doing that because, look, we  don’t have a lot of options. When the  President wrote his budget, he had $2.3  trillion more in revenue than we have.  Now, he did his budget some time earlier, and the forecasts were more robust. Once CBO did their more recent  forecast, $2.3 trillion was gone. That  requires a response, if we are also going  to answer the President’s charge to  dramatically bring down the deficit,  and we have also done that—from $1.7  trillion in 2009 to just over $500 billion  in 2014. That is a reduction of more  than two-thirds in the deficit of the  United States.  Of course, economists like to measure it in terms of a percentage of gross  domestic product rather than dollar  terms because that adjusts for inflation. But look what we have done in  that way: We have gone from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to less than 3 percent as a deficit and share of the economy in 2014—again, more than a two-  thirds reduction—and we get below the  magic 3 percent, which is where most  economists say we stabilize the growth  of the debt.  I am quite proud of what this budget  has accomplished in the 5 years of its  term. I am the first to acknowledge  that when Senator GREGG stands and  says we are not doing enough about the  second 5 years, sign me up. I agree with  him entirely. Certainly, the President’s  budget has far more debt and deficit in  the second 5 years than ours, if you extended our policies. But I would say  that either one of them doesn’t do  enough for the second 5 years. We have  to do much more. That is why Senator  GREGG and I have proposed a special  procedure to give 16 Members the responsibility to come up with a plan,  and if 12 of the 16 agree, then that plan  would come to Congress for a vote.

405,92,2009-03-30,Mr. CONRAD., I am happy to.  ,2009
406,92,2009-03-30,Mr. HATCH.," I understand the nominal rate argument. The problem is that  we are talking about taxing the corporate profits that are earned overseas.  No other major industrialized nation in  the world does that. If they do that,  they make us globally uncompetitive.  In just the last couple of weeks, I  have been trying to raise money for the  National Republican Senatorial Committee. As I have called around, it is  amazing to me how many corporate executives have said to me: We love this  country. We want our companies to  grow in this country. We want to be  able to stay here.  Some of them are second-generation  folks. But I have had a number of them  say that if we do some of the corporate  tax changes and some of the tax expenses that are assessed in this bill,  they will move. One in particular said:  I am going to have to move my company to Switzerland because we will  not be competitive if that particular  budget passes.  Now, I believe we can make arguments that the nominal rate may be  something  that must be considered,  and I think it should, but I don’t think  you can argue against the fact that we  are doing some very stupid things in  this budget. Frankly, in the end, we  might wind up having a lot more difficulty and we may lose even more of  our major businesses because  to be  competitive they will move, and a lot  of them have already moved.  So  let’s wake up around here and  let’s realize that—look, I respect the  distinguished Senator from North Dakota. He has one of the tougher jobs—  he and our colleague, the Senator from  New Hampshire, JUDDGREGG, have one  of the tougher jobs in the history of  the country. Doing these budgets  is  very difficult with some of the problems we have. But I have listed three  things that are going to sock corporate  America like you can’t believe. Frankly, one of them is the third point on  the prong, and that is taxing corporate  profits overseas. It is just a matter of  reality that if we do this, we are going  to reap the whirlwind. It is just that  simple.  ",2009
407,92,2009-03-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President, if  my colleague from North Dakota would  yield for a question on this subject.  ",2009
408,92,2009-03-30,Mr. CONRAD., I am happy to yield.  ,2009
409,92,2009-03-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Our colleague  from  Utah, Senator HATCH, if he would just  observe, this issue is not a new one. I  know Senator GRASSLEY, who is on the  Finance Committee, is here, and there  has been a lot of discussion about this:  Do we have an extraordinarily high  rate of  taxation on corporations or  don’t we? We just heard on the floor  that we rank I think the second highest in tax rates on corporations. Well,  this is not some arcane discussion between people who can’t understand exactly what is happening. We rank, I believe, third from the bottom in the rate  of taxes paid by corporations of all of  the OECD  countries—30-some  countries, we rank third from the bottom,  not from the top.  So they come out here and say: Well,  we have a high rate. Our statutory rate  is high, toward the top, no question  about that, but that is not what corporations are paying. They are not  paying the rate, they are paying the  rate minus all of the deductions and  loopholes. The fact is, the corporate  tax burden  in this country  is right  close to the bottom of all of the other  industrialized  countries.  Now,  this  ought not be debatable. We can easily  find out what the facts are. So are we  competitive with respect to the corporate income tax? The answer is yes.  I understand why the Chamber of  Commerce and others want to perpetuate  this notion  that  somehow we  overtax corporations, but, in fact, the  taxes paid by American corporations  rank right near the bottom of all of the  30 or so OECD countries, the industrialized countries—right toward the bottom, not the top. That is what they, in  fact, pay. If we are going to debate public policy, let’s debate it with a set of  facts so that we all understand what  the facts are. The fact that people are  talking about this in the context of  what  is the tax burden on corporations? The answer is, we are toward the  bottom of all of the OECD countries.  Those are the facts.  ",2009
410,92,2009-03-30,Mr. CONRAD.," Madam President, the  Senator is correct. I am on the Finance  Committee, and I have this responsibility on the Budget Committee. It is  very clear, while we do have a high  nominal rate—I think we are second  highest  in the  industrialized world—  the effective rate that companies actually pay, we are near the bottom.  At this point, I wish to yield 25 minutes to my colleague from North Dakota.  ",2009
411,92,2009-03-30,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President,  I  know this is a very important debate,  this issue of the budget. This is: What  are our priorities? I have said often  that 100 years from now, we will all be  dead and the only evidence of what our  value  system was  right here,  right  know, will be evaluated by historians.  Historians will be alive, and they will  look back and say: What did that country believe in? What was their value  system? What did they think was important? What did they invest in? So  take a look at all of this and then  make judgments.  We will have a debate all this week  on this issue: What is important for the  country? What do we believe represents  our highest set of values? Kids? I have  always said I know what might be in  second, third, or fourth place in people’s lives, but I certainly know what is  in  first place—their kids,  right? So  what about our budget with respect to  health care for kids, just as an example. When we establish the priorities of  what is important in our country, this  is where we do it: in the budget. We debate it, we think about it, and then we  say: This is what our country believes  to be  important. Here  is what we  should invest in to make this a better  place in which to live.  I came to the floor to say something  about the financial crisis and the financial meltdown in our country because that has a profound impact on  this debate on the budget. This financial meltdown has begun to dry up the  Federal revenues on the tax side. It has  pushed up dramatically the expenditure side because we have what are  called  stabilizers  in  our  economy.  When people lose their jobs, they get  unemployment  checks. So we have  these  economic  stabilizers  that  increase spending, even during this financial crisis when you see decreased revenue. That has a huge impact on this  budget.  If this financial crisis has this kind  of an impact on the budget, then we  have a right to know what has caused  all of this to happen, and what can we  do  to make  sure  it never happens  again.  Last week,  the Secretary  of  the  Treasury announced a number of steps  for  financial  regulatory reform, and  those are a move in the right direction.  He says we are going to regulate hedge  funds, we are going to require the oversight of what are unregulated derivatives—these  fancy,  exotic  financial  products these days—we are going to  require many of them to be regulated,  although not fully. He needs to go further. But the Secretary is moving in  the right direction to regulate hedge  funds, to get rid of this dark money  and bring derivatives and CDOs and  credit default swaps and so on into the  daylight. Then he talks about a powerful regulator that would be able to  take a look at systemic risks and so  on. I think all of that advances the ball  and is in the right direction.  But this doesn’t yet answer the larger question we have to answer with respect to this financial crisis and this  meltdown. That larger question, using  an automobile metaphor, is this: Is it  time for a tuneup or is it time for a  complete overhaul of the system?  I  come down on the side that you have  to overhaul the entire system if you  are going to provide the confidence  needed in the American people going  forward.

412,120,2009-03-30,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition to introduce legislation  to  further  expand  the home  buyer tax credit.  A robust home buyer tax credit will  spur consumer demand and help to stop  the  fall  in home values, which continues to affect millions of Americans.  This decline is destroying the savings  and net worth of Americans, whose  homes are their most valuable asset.  Many now have mortgages that exceed  the value of their homes.  The Housing and Economic Recovery  Act of 2008 created a tax credit  for  first-time  home  buyers  of  $7,500  through June of 2009. However, taxpayers were required to repay the tax  credit  in equal  installments over 15  years, which greatly reduced its effectiveness. The 2009 Stimulus bill waived  the  repayment  requirement  for purchases made  in  2009,  increased  the  value of the credit to $8,000, and extended eligibility for purchases made  through November of 2009.  Further improvements are necessary,  in my judgment, to bring about a recovery in the housing market that will  ultimately  contribute  to  the  turnaround of the broader economy. First,  this bill would amend the Stimulus bill  and raise the value to $15,000, or 10 percent of the value of the home, whichever is less.  Second,  this bill would make  the  home buyer tax credit available to any  individual who purchases a home, not  just first-time home buyers. Doing so  would stimulate demand for the entire  range of homes on the market.  Finally, this bill would remove the  income  eligibility  threshold. Again,  doing so would stimulate demand for  the entire range of homes on the market. Currently, the credit is reduced for  individuals  with modified  adjusted  gross  income, AGI,  of more  than  $75,000, $150,000 for joint filers, and is  zero for those individuals with modified AGI in excess of $95,000, $170,000 for  joint filers.  The need for a robust home buyer tax  credit is clear. According to the National Association of Realtors, pending  home sales hit a record low in January  2009. The Pending Home Sales Index,  which measures the number of sales  contracts signed each month, fell 7.7  percent to 80.4, the lowest mark since  2001 when tracking began.  At the same time, the housing affordability  index  rose  13.6  percentage  points to a record high of 166.8. A value  of 100 means that a family with the  country’s median income has exactly  enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced existing single-family home. The higher the index,  the better housing affordability is for  buyers.  These two  figures, taken together,  demonstrate that a robust home buyer  tax credit is needed to spur demand  from Americans that are hesitant to  buy homes for fear that prices will not  stabilize.  Recent reports indicate a 13-month  supply of unsold new homes, compared  with a 4-month supply under more normal circumstances. Add to that a continually  increasing number of  foreclosed  homes.  According  to  the  RealtyTrac 2008 Year-End Foreclosure  Market Report, a total of 3.2 million  foreclosure  filings—default  notices,  auction sale notices and bank repossessions—were reported on 2.3 million U.S.  properties during 2008, an 81 percent increase in total properties from 2007 and  a 225 percent increase in total properties from 2006.  Jobs across all industries have been  lost as a result of the housing crisis.  According to a March 2, 2009, op-ed in  the Washington Post by Robert J.  Samuelson, ‘‘Since late 2007, housing-  related  jobs—carpenters,  real  estate  agents, appraisers—have dropped by 1  million, a quarter of all lost jobs.’’  I applaud the efforts of Senator JOHNNYISAKSON, who has been the leader on  this issue in the Senate. I cosponsored  his legislation in the 110th Congress to  create a home buyer tax credit. In the  111th Congress, I supported his amendment to the Stimulus bill to make improvements to the credit and I have decided to join him as a cosponsor of S.  253, which seeks to make further improvements.  The bill I am introducing is different  from S. 253 in three main ways. First,  my bill would improve the home buyer  credit using the 2009 Stimulus bill as a  starting point. Second, my bill would  increase  the value of  the credit  to  $15,000, or 10 percent of the home value,  whichever is less, whereas S. 253 would  increase the credit amount to 10 percent of the home price capped at 3.5  percent of Federal Housing Administration loan limits. These limits are  geographically dependent and would  yield a credit ranging between approximately $10,000 and $22,000. Finally, my  bill would remove income limitations  on the credit, whereas S. 253 limits the  credit  for  individuals earning up to  $125,000, or $250,000 in the case of a joint  return.  I believe it is important for both bills  to be pending so that additional ideas  can be debated. To that end, I look forward to working with Senator ISAKSON  to build consensus and support for further  improvements. As  long as  forecasts predict that home prices are falling and that the economy will remain  weak, a  large  fraction of potential  homebuyers may choose to remain on  the sidelines without a robust tax credit in place.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, or  the  legislation  introduced by Senator ISAKSON, to make  further  improvements  to  the home  buyer tax credit.  By ",2009

414,120,2009-03-30,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, American taxpayers face another Federal income tax deadline. The date of April 15  stabs fear, anxiety, and unease into the  hearts of millions of Americans. Every  year during ‘‘tax season,’’ millions of  Americans spend their evenings pouring over page after page of IRS instructions,  going  through  their  records  looking for information and struggling  to find and fill out all the appropriate  forms on their Federal tax returns.  Americans  are  intimidated  by  the  sheer number of different tax  forms  and their instructions, many of which  they may be unsure whether they need  to  file. Given the approximately 582  possible forms, not to mention the instructions that accompany them, simply trying to determine which form to  file can  in  itself be a daunting and  overwhelming task. According to the  2008 annual  report  to Congress,  released on January 7, 2009 by the National Taxpayer Advocate for the IRS,  U.S. taxpayers and businesses spend  about 7.6 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of  the Internal Revenue Code. This figure  does not include the millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend  when they are required to respond to  an IRS notice or audit. Much of this  time is spent burrowing through IRS  laws and regulations which  fill over  17,000  pages  and  have  grown  from  744,000 words  in  1955  to  7.1 million  words in 2005. By contrast, the Pledge  of Allegiance has only 31 words, the  Gettysburg Address has 267 words, the  Declaration of Independence has about  1,300 words, and the Bible has only  about 1,773,000 words.  The majority of taxpayers still face  filing tax forms that are far too complicated and take far too long to complete. According  to  the  IRS’s most  available data, the average time burden  for all  taxpayers  filing a  1040,  1040A, or 1040EZ in 2006 was 26.4 hours,  with an average cost of $207 per return.  Taxpayers filing 1040 forms had an average  burden  of  approximately  34  hours. Moreover,  this complexity  is  getting worse each year. According to  the estimated preparation time listed  on the forms by the IRS, the 1999 Form  1040 was estimated to take 12 hours and  51 minutes to complete. Thus, the time  it now takes to fill out these tax forms  has more than doubled over an eight  year period.  It is no wonder that more than 80  percent of  individual  taxpayers pay  transaction  fees to help  file tax returns. Well over half of all taxpayers,  61 percent according to a recent survey, now hire an outside professional  to prepare their tax returns for them.  However, the fact that only about 35  percent of individuals itemize their deductions shows that a significant percentage of our taxpaying population  believes that the tax system  is too  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:17 Mar 31, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30MR6.054 S30MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009

422,141,2009-03-30,Mr. WOLF.," Madam Speaker,  the  right  to  worship according to the dictates of your conscience is among the most precious freedoms.  Tragically this basic freedom has not been  realized for millions around the globe. On January 16, the State Department designated the  annual ‘‘Countries of Particular Concern.’’ This  notorious  distinction  is  given  to  countries  deemed particularly severe violators of  religious  freedom. This year  the  list  included  Burma, China, Eritrea,  Iran, North Korea,  Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Uzbekistan.  Oftentimes the most powerful testimony of  the repressive nature of these governments is  found in the accounts of their own people.  Take the words of a 23-year-old Burmese  monk: ‘‘We did not expect that the junta would  crush down a peaceful demonstration but  when they raided the monasteries, shot and  arrested the monks. I was so surprised and  unbelievable that I could not express how my  feelings were. All my beliefs were also destroyed.’’  Or  the  reflections  of  a Chinese  house  church  leader:  ‘‘First, when  they arrest you,  they try to convince you to give up your faith.  And when you surrender  to  them  they will  offer you an office in a position such as community member or a position in the Three Self  church. If you do not deny your faith and surrender to them, then they will attack you. First  they put you into a small place, isolate you,  and they let you starve to convince you.’’  Or these insights from North Korea: ‘‘North  Korea  is a prison without bars. The reason  why the North Korean system still exists is because of the strict surveillance system. When  we provide the information like ‘this family believes  in a  religion  from  their grandfather’s  generation,’ the National Security Agency will  arrest each family member. That is why entire  families are scared of one another. Everyone  is supposed to be watching one another like  this . . .’’.  With the 1998 passage of the International  Religious Freedom Act, legislation which I authored, the promotion of religious freedom became official U.S.  foreign policy. Sadly, 10  years  later,  the  fight  for  this  ‘‘first  freedom’’  has never been more necessary. We must  commit ourselves anew to standing with persecuted people of faith around the world who  against all odds, in the face of fear, intimidation, imprisonment, torture and worse gather  secretly  to worship as  their conscience demands.  f  CONGRATULATING DR.

423,141,2009-03-30,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate my good friend, Dr. Jim Jacobs,  as he is inaugurated as the Fifth President of  Macomb Community College. Jim has the creative intelligence, passion, in-depth knowledge  of  the challenges  facing Michigan, and collaborative energy  to  lead  this  fine  institution  through  these next vital years of economic  transformation  for  our State’s  businesses,  workers and communities.  Jim Jacobs has more than 40 years of experience at Macomb Community College. He  began teaching economics in 1967 and continued  teaching both economics and political  science for sixteen years before leading efforts  to establish both the Tech Prep and Machinist  Training institutes.  Jim Jacobs has a vast array of expertise in  the areas of occupational change and  technology, suburban economic development, occupational education,  retraining of displaced  workers and needs assessment of occupational programs. He has played a significant  role in these areas at the national, state and  local level, both conducting and publishing research and developing programs.  Jim Jacobs is the past president of the National Council for Workforce Education, a national post-secondary organization of occupational education and workforce development  specialists. He served on  the  team  that assisted the Michigan Department of Labor and  Economic Growth in the development of Reshaping Michigan’s Workforce: An Action Plan  of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth. He was also part of  the research staff and a report writer for Lt. Governor John Cherry’s Commission on Higher  Education & Economic Growth.  At the local level, Jim Jacobs is viewed by  many as the authoritative voice on the economic climate in Macomb County. Each January for the past 23 years, Jim Jacobs has presented his economic  forecast  for Macomb  County to an often sell-out crowd of business,  government and civic  leaders. He has also  served on a number of community boards, including Peoples State Bank, Macomb  Inter-  Faith Action Center, United Way and St. John  Hospital, and is a member of the board of directors of  the Community College Research  Center, New York.  I have had the pleasure of working with Jim  Jacobs on numerous projects over the years.  Including, school-to-work efforts, the redevelopment of the Tank Plant property (the local  committee was co-chaired by Jim), worker re-  training, and the impact of trade and monetary  policies. On a whole range of issues, Jim is always available with wise and  thoughtful  insights and the economic statistics to make his  case.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Dr. Jim Jacobs as he assumes  this  important position. With his  immense skills and masterful understanding of  the local area he and the community college  will play a key role in continuing efforts to revolutionize the work force in Macomb County to  prosper in this new economy.  f  IN HONOR OF THE STUDENTS AT  ANOKA HIGH SCHOOL, MN  HON.

These students are taking their talents  to the next level and joining with the Juvenile  Diabetes Research Foundation to help fellow  students that are afflicted by this lifelong disease.  Using  the  Tony Award-winning musical,  Aida, as well as their reputation as one of Minnesota’s best high school musical theater programs, students at Anoka High School are  learning more  than choreography and stage  cues. They’ll be raising money and awareness  for juvenile diabetes. Through the ‘‘Kids Showing They Care’’ program, teens are able to be  involved  in a  larger cause  that affects  their  community and have  the opportunity  to use  their talents and skills to help others. They can  also see the growing impact of their seemingly  small efforts and understand the importance of  a collective effort in a successful production.  I rise today to honor the students at Anoka  High School who have taken on an ambitious  endeavor today, producing a school musical,  that will have a lifelong impact on themselves  and others. I commend them for their desire to  help others  in need and  their very mature  sense of community.

The bill  is identical to noncontroversial legislation that passed the House during the  110th Congress.  The overall purpose of the bill is to  assist  in  the  conservation  of  the  world’s 15 crane species, including the  two crane species found in North America,  the whooping  crane  and  the  sandhill crane. The bill would establish  a new crane conservation fund to finance Federal matching grants that  support critical conservation projects  that conserve these highly endangered  birds and their scarce and shrinking  habitats in Europe, Asia, South Asia,  Africa, and North America. The legislation also mirrors other highly popular  and  effective  wildlife  conservation  funds  authorized  under  the Multinational Species Conservation Fund  that  support other critically endangered wildlife species and their habitats.  Mr. Speaker, cranes play an important iconic role in cultures around the  world. These birds are viewed as universal symbols of peace, happiness, and  good fortune. I ask Members on both  sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill that will help to conserve this family of large, charismatic  birds.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.

Under  this  legislation, a new  international conservation  fund  is going to be established to assist up to 15 species of  cranes that are in Africa, Asia, Australia, North America—I guess everyone except South America.  There are currently seven crane species that are protected under our Endangered Species Act. The two most  imperiled species reside here  in the  United States and are covered.  The United States already has several laws on the books which can help  conserve domestic  cranes and  their  habitats, which includes such things as  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty,  the  Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act, wetlands conservation statutes, and the Endangered Species Act.  With the current economic crisis the  United States finds itself in—exacerbated by our spending bills in the stimulus, in the budget, and the omnibus  bills which simply spend too much, tax  too much, and borrow too much—it is  highly questionable whether this is the  time to once again create another multinational  fund  to  spend  taxpayers’  money  overseas.  Other  countries  should be required to step up to the  plate to save their own wildlife without  relying on American funds going there.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

The drought has largely been man-  made because of litigation to protect a  3-inch fish, and it will decrease Southern California’s water supplies. As a result, there will be water rationing in  some areas and water rates will  increase for working families and businesses.  There will be less imported water to  recycle. However, water recycling  is  still, in the long term, a necessity for  California and other arid regions in the  West.

442,12,2009-04-21,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the pending legislation  would settle a longstanding dilemma  faced by the people of the Navajo and  Hopi Nations in Arizona. At the outset,  I would commend our colleague from  Arizona (Mrs. KIRKPATRICK) for her tenacity in working to have this measure  considered by the House, and hopefully  by the end of the day, passed and sent  to the President for his signature.  The need for this legislation dates  back to an executive order issued in  1882 which set aside land in northern  Arizona for the Hopi Tribe and such  other Indians as the Secretary of the  Interior may see fit to settle thereon.  A 1934 act of Congress setting aside  some of the same lands for the Navajo  Nation further complicated the matter.  In  1962, a Federal District Court  ruled that both the Hopi Tribe and the  Navajo Nation had joint rights to use  the land in dispute. This ruling created  great tension between the two tribes  over critical issues such as access to  sacred sites and the development of  lands in the joint use area. Because of  this  situation,  in  1966  the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  Robert Bennett, issued a freeze on any  development on  the disputed  lands.  This freeze extended to some of the  core aspects of tribal life, including the  building of homes,  improvement  to  property, public works projects, power  lines, and water and sewer access.  After nearly a century of dispute between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi  Tribe, the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act  was enacted in 1974 in an attempt to  settle rights and interests between the  two Native nations. However, in 1980,  Congress amended that act to codify  the Bennett Freeze. As a result of this  freeze on development, tribal citizens  living in the Bennett Freeze region find  themselves  living  in 1966 conditions.  Only 3 percent of these  families affected by the Bennett Freeze have electricity and only 10 percent have running water.  In 2005, the Navajo and the Hopi governments entered into an intergovernmental agreement  that  resolved all  outstanding issues regarding the land  in dispute. This agreement contains  language which puts an end to the ban  on development on the disputed lands.  The Secretary of the Interior approved  this agreement in September 2006.  This legislation will clarify the law  so that it is in agreement with all of  the land users and finally close this  longstanding dispute between neighboring Indian tribes.  I once again commend our colleague,  Mrs. KIRKPATRICK, who has a  companion bill here in the House for her  work in getting this bill to the floor  today. The aforementioned conditions  of those living in the Bennett Freeze  area are unacceptable. The tribes have  resolved their issues and the administration has fulfilled its duties, and now  it is time for us to pass this legislation  and fulfill our trust responsibility to  these two native nations.  I urge all of my colleagues to support  the passage of Senate bill 39.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

447,19,2009-04-21,Mr. LYNCH.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As a member of the House Committee  on Oversight and Government Reform,  I  join my colleagues  in  support of  House Resolution 214, which recognizes  the efforts of volunteers from across  the country who helped the Commonwealth of Kentucky recover from a devastating ice storm in January 2009.  I would like to thank our colleague  Mr. BRETTGUTHRIE from Kentucky for  sponsoring this thoughtful resolution  which was introduced on March 5, 2009.  I would also like to commend my colleagues on the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform for  acting so quickly to bring this measure  to the floor. Additionally, this measure  has the support and cosponsorship of 59  Members of Congress, which of course  include  the entire House delegation  from Kentucky.  As many Americans are aware, the  Commonwealth of Kentucky suffered a  horrendous ice storm on January 26,  2009. More than 700,000 homes and businesses were left without power. Sadly,  some  estimated  200,000  Americans  found  themselves without access  to  water and other basic necessities. In  fact, the dreadful ice storm that hit a  number of States in the Midwest in addition to the State of Kentucky back  in January has been considered the  worst natural disaster in Kentucky’s  history.  As expected, when Americans  saw  their fellow countrymen in need of help  and assistance, support poured into the  State of Kentucky  immediately  following the storm’s devastating effect.  For example, State and local officials  acted quickly to band together in order  to coordinate the relief efforts and to  ultimately save lives. Volunteer agencies,  faith-based groups and community organizations from 15 States came  to the aid of Kentucky’s cities and  neighborhoods, and nearly 200 makeshift shelters provided refuge for almost  8,000 Kentuckians. While  certainly tragic in nature, the ice storm  once  again  demonstrated  the  unyielding  resolve  of Americans  to  work together to ensure the common  good of the neighbors.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is also  important  that we as Members of the House of  Representatives take a moment to recognize the supportive efforts of the  Kentucky National Guard as some 4,600  guardsmen went door to door throughout the affected communities to make  certain that no citizen was beyond the  reach of a helpful hand. For their commitment, we say thank you, and for  their service, we say a job well done.  In closing, House Resolution 214 is  designed to simply recognize the Commonwealth of Kentucky for showing incredible resolve in the face of disaster.  The  selflessness exhibited by volunteers and aid agencies speaks volumes  about the American spirit.  That said, Mr. Speaker, as Kentucky  and  their  neighboring Midwestern  States continue to pick up the pieces,  let us take pause to acknowledge those  who came to the aid of these Americans in their time of need.  With that, I urge support for House  Resolution 214, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
448,19,2009-04-21,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of House Resolution 214, recognizing the efforts of  the countless volunteers who helped  the Commonwealth of Kentucky  recover from the ice storm of January  2009.  This past January, the massive ice  storm that devastated States from Arkansas to West Virginia hit Kentucky  the hardest, leaving more than 700,000  homes and businesses without  electricity. This violent storm was Kentucky’s worst natural disaster in the  State’s history as it pounded the area  with an inch or more of ice, causing  trees and power lines to fall, forcing  Statewide  evacuations,  schools  and  businesses to close, fuel shortages, as  well as causing debris to block more  than 5,000  linear miles of roads  following the storm. The ice storm left  more than 35 people dead, making this  the State’s most lethal storm in memory and one of Kentucky’s deadliest  modern weather events.  On January 27, the Kentucky Governor declared a state of emergency for  roughly  100  counties,  all  of which  President Obama soon after declared as  Federal disaster areas. The Governor  also for the first time activated every  member of Kentucky’s National Guard,  dispatching all 4,600 guardsmen to assist with the crisis. With around-the-  clock help from local, State and Federal officials and emergency personnel,  many working  in subzero conditions  for days, relief efforts were carried out  quickly and safely.  It is important that we recognize the  generous support of the many volunteers, private and corporate donors, religious groups, and charitable organizations that assisted the communities in  Kentucky in their time of need. This  resolution  expresses a  sincere  sympathy  for  the victims of  this devastating storm, and recognizes the action of their public servants, citizens  and  community  leaders who helped  hundreds of  thousands  through  this  Statewide hardship.  Once again, we are reminded of the  strength of the people of this country,  and applaud the citizens of Kentucky  who in this very difficult time became  beacons of light for those who suffered  as a result of this icy disaster.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

Mr. Speaker, I would  like to  first  thank my distinguished colleague from  Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) for his leadership in introducing H.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the  thousands of generous and dedicated  Kentuckians who took action in the  wake of the catastrophic  ice storms  that hit the Commonwealth on January 26 of this year.

The mood will be jubilant, and justifiably so, but it could not be so if not for  the round-the-clock dedication of thousands of volunteers,  first responders  and National Guard who spared our region from lasting devastation.  The storm created the worst power  outages in Kentucky history, and of  the 3,000 streets in Louisville, not one  was spared  from  fallen trees, power  lines and other wreckage, leaving our  city with enough debris to fill Cardinal  Stadium. Thousands were  displaced,  but they were not alone. Neighbors  helped neighbors and people from all  walks of life rose to the occasion to  provide food and shelter to those in  need.

453,26,2009-04-21,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise to commemorate one of  the most  important events  in Texas  history,  frankly,  the history of  the  United States, San Jacinto Day.  Today, in 1836, roughly 900 Texan and  Tejano volunteers overpowered a larger, professional Mexican army of conscript soldiers after defeats at Goliad  and  the Alamo. These outnumbered  volunteers  succeeded  because  they  were fighting against tyranny and they  were fighting for their families.  In the words of the Texas Declaration  of Independence, the people’s government had been ‘‘forcibly changed, without their consent,  from a restricted  federative republic composed of sovereign states to a consolidated central  military despotism.’’  The Texas Revolution  proved  the  bonds of freedom are stronger than ethnicity,  as many Tejanos  sacrificed  their lives for Texas’ freedom at the  Battles of Gonzalez, Bexar, Goliad, the  Alamo, and San Jacinto. The war was  not between Anglos and Hispanics; it  was a struggle between all Texans and  military dictatorship in Mexico City.  Texans and Tejanos knew then what  we know now—freedom requires sacrifice. And our young men and women  going to or coming back from fighting  in Afghanistan and Iraq are very aware  of this.  Texans  are  renowned  around  the  world  for responding to the call of  duty. We hold our heroes willing to  sacrifice their lives for the betterment  of their fellow man in the highest regard. I am proud to represent the site  of the Battle of San Jacinto commemorated by the San Jacinto Monument.  Thanks to the San Jacinto Chapter  of the Daughters of the Republic of  Texas. Their hard work allowed for the  preservation of the San Jacinto Battleground by petitioning the Texas Legislature to purchase the acreage and by  donating their treasury to complete  the sale in 1900. This San Jacinto Chapter of Daughters of the Republic of  Texas and the Texas Veterans Association did tremendous work to ensure  that the legacy lives on, and the importance of the park has only expanded  since then. The park not only has the  San Jacinto Monument to recognize  the brave men and women, but it also  includes the Battleship Texas, which is  a symbol of sacrifices in World War I  and World War II.  With  the understanding  of where  they came from, Texans and Americans  will continue to respond to the calls of  service, thereby continuing their legacy of respect and admiration throughout the world.  God  bless Texas  States.  the United  and  f  THANK YOU TROOPS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. During the recess, I was grateful to visit  for the 10th time with troops in Iraq,  and my eighth visit with troops in Afghanistan. As our delegation met with  servicemembers of our home States, it  is inspiring to see the commitment to  protecting American families at home  by defeating terrorists overseas.  We learned in Baghdad that terrorist  attacks have been reduced by over 90  percent from 2007 due to the success of  the surge. The next day, when President Obama spoke, he stated,  ‘‘You  have given  Iraq  the opportunity  to  stand on its own as a democratic country. That is an extraordinary achievement.’’  As the father of two sons who have  served in Iraq, I am especially appreciative of military families. In Afghanistan, it was explained that extensive  plans are underway to expand the Afghan National Army, the Afghan police, and the Afghan border police. I  know firsthand of the success of local  forces as my former National Guard  unit, the 218th Brigade, completed a  year of service at Camp Phoenix last  year promoting a civil society.  In conclusion, God bless our troops—  and we will never forget September the  11th and the global war on terrorism.  and the deep respect he earned even  from those he didn’t persuade.  As a  local paper wrote,  ‘‘Utahans  couldn’t have done much better than  electing Bill Orton.’’ I agree with that  sentiment, Mr. Speaker. In just three  terms here, Bill left a permanent mark.  He was a founder of the Blue Dog Coalition, which has stood up for fiscal discipline  ever  since and  is well  represented here tonight.  Bill was instrumental in creating the  Democratic  ideal of  fiscal  responsibility. And ever since, when Democrats  have come to this floor to defend the  government’s essential programs while  advocating for a balanced budget, they  have been following in Bill’s footsteps.  Now, every time we speak out for a  government that pays for what it buys,  we have an opportunity to carry on  Bill’s work.  But as much as we will miss him, I  know that his community and his family will miss him incomparably more.  Bill became a father late in life, but his  boys, Will and Wes, filled what turned  out to be the last years of his life with  so much joy. Those who know Bill remember, I’m sure, how he turned half  of his congressional office into a nursery, or how he proudly brought baby  Will to sit with him at hearings.  I know that nothing can make up for  the loss of a father, particularly a father of young children. For Jacquelyn  Orton, I know that nothing can make  up for the loss of her husband. But I  hope  it will be  some  consolation—  small, but some—to know that Bill was  important to the life of his State and  of his Nation, and that he shaped them  for the better; that even though he had  more to give, he gave much more than  most ever do.  To his family, we extend great sympathy. From his country, to Bill Orton,  we say thank you; thank you for serving so well the people of Utah and the  people of the United States of America.  God bless his family.  f  f  HONORING FORMER MEMBER OF  CONGRESS BILL ORTON  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

458,33,2009-04-21,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the floor tonight with an issue of enormous importance before the American  people on my mind. And I’ll be joined  in just a few moments by distinguished  colleagues  from around  the country  who share my profound concern about  legislation that has come to be known  as cap-and-trade legislation. It is an effort that is under way here on Capitol  Hill and from the Obama administration that could well result in an increase in energy cost for the average  American  household  of more  than  $3,000 per year.  b2045  Now we want to talk about the facts  and the data here because, even  in  newspapers and  in wire services tonight, that number, which is the calculation of a study done by MIT, is the  subject of some dispute and of some debate. I want to concede the point that  the impact on the average American  household, if the President and the majority’s cap-and-trade bill were to become law, could actually be much higher than that. In fact, it would be President Obama, himself, as a candidate in  January 2008, who spoke these words in  a meeting with the editorial board of  the San Francisco Chronicle, and  I  would say to any of our citizens who  are looking in and who are Internet  savvy: Don’t take my word for it. Go to  youtube.com and type  in the President’s name and the San Francisco  Chronicle, and you can watch him say  it for yourself.  I give the President, whose office and  his person I respect, credit for candor.  In January of 2008, he referred to this  plan upon which he was campaigning  and a plan upon which Democrats have  now offered  legislation, hearings  for  which begin this week.  The President said, ‘‘Under my plan  of a cap-and-trade system, electricity  rates would necessarily  skyrocket.’’  Adding, ‘‘That would cost money, and  they will pass that money on to consumers.’’  Let me say again: While a careful  calculation of a study done, I believe,  in 2007 by a distinguished university,  MIT, estimates that the average American household would experience  increased energy costs of some $3,128 per  year, then candidate and now-President of the United States of America,  Barack Obama, said that, if his cap-  and-trade system passed into law, electricity  rates would necessarily  skyrocket.  Now, the last time I checked, which  was just late last week, most of this  country was going through one of the  worst recessions we’ve experienced in  decades. I say with a heavy heart that  the people of Indiana recently learned  that the unemployment rate in my fair  State is now at 10 percent. The American  people  are hurting,  struggling  under the weight of the listing economic fortunes of this Nation. Let me  say that the last thing, I believe, the  American people want this Congress to  do is to pass energy legislation in the  name of dealing with climate change  that could result  in, to borrow the  President’s phrase, a skyrocketing of  electricity rates on working families,  small  business  owners  and  family  farms.  As I prepare to begin to recognize  some of my colleagues, many of whom  have gotten to know more about this  topic than  I will have a chance to  learn, I also want to make one more  point  about  this:  This  legislation,  known as the American Clean Energy  and Security Act, offered on March 31,  2009, by House Energy and Commerce  Chairman WAXMANof California and by  the Energy  and Environment Subcommittee Chairman MARKEY, could  not only result in this massive energy  tax increase, but I want to say, if this  legislation were to pass into law, it  would be tantamount to a declaration  of economic war on the Midwest by the  liberal majority of this Congress.  Now, people who have known me over  the last 8 years in this Congress know  that I like to turn a phrase, but I don’t  like to be an alarmist, and so, for me  to come to the floor of this Congress  and say that I believe if the President’s  cap-and-trade bill were to become law  it would, in effect, be a declaration of  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:52 Apr 22, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K21AP7.066 H21APPT1 E S U O H h t i w 7 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2009
459,40,2009-04-21,Mr. TONKO.," I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon, and he obviously  has an outstanding voice speaking to  what is the smart approach to the future of this country and certainly to  the impact that we can make on American households and on American businesses.  The country faces, undeniably, economic energy and certainly climate  crises, and this is a time for a plan of  action.  I believe that as we have just heard,  there are these opportunities that are  shelf ready, available to American consumers, to American businesses today.  There are emerging technologies as we  speak. This requires an immense investment.  And if there is a strategy that has  been promoted here by the President  that has been advanced by the Speaker  of this House, NANCYPELOSI, and endorsed by the leadership, it’s to move  forward in a way that is intellectually  honest, looking at the factors out there  that exist. The human elements that  are causing an impact through global  warming, through climate change that  are growing the carbon footprint.  The President knows that the down  payment of the Recovery Act was just  the beginning of the story. He knows  that in order to resolve the many crises facing this country, including, primarily, an economic crisis, we need to  be smart about our plan of action. He  knows that it will require an investment, an investment through R&D, of  research and development that will enable us to produce savings.  And we hear an awful  lot of talk  about a tax being  imposed. The tax  that is imposed is coming through billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of  dollars paid by American companies,  by American  consumers,  by households, that is going to places like the  Middle East and Venezuela, paying for  fossil-based fuels that are polluting our  environment, that are driving downward, through these crises, the American economy.  We have an option out there, and  that option is to be smart, to go forward with American-produced power,  done through American jobs, to save  and grow American jobs. That is a good  and clever strategy. We can do this by  embracing the intellectual capacity of  this great Nation, shelf-ready opportunities of which I am quite familiar.  Certainly, when I was over at the Energy Research and Development Authority in New York State, I witnessed  firsthand how policies and programs  were  implemented by that authority  that is nationally inspected, and it was  through the retrofits that we had done  with the farming community, with the  business community, with households,  through building efforts, that we were  able to achieve immense savings.  These savings are dollars and benefits to the consuming public. They are  job creating  in  terms of dynamics.  When we look at the renewable standards, the renewable energy standards  that are part of the package to respond  to the energy crises of this country, we  are talking about the creation of some  300,000 jobs.  When we  look at the energy efficiency resource standards, we are looking at some 220,000 jobs. When we look  at the economic savings of the energy  jobs creation, the green-collar job creation, we are talking about a savings of  some of $100 billion. In the area of energy efficiency, a savings of $170 billion. So these are real dollars. They are  savings.  What I think our  friends who are  speaking so vociferously against this  proposal do not comprehend, that savings and cleanup of our environment  are benefits that are immeasurable at  this point in time, and this economy  requires that sort of investment, that  sort of policy creation.  ",2009
460,40,2009-04-21,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Absolutely spot  on, and I hope that you can stay with  us.  We have been joined by a number of  our colleagues here, and I would like to  be able to move as quickly as I can to  include them, because we have truly  outstanding leaders.  I want to turn next to JOHNHALL,  with whom I have been privileged to  serve on the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.  Our colleague, Congressman HALL,  has been a leader in the environmental  movement long before he came to Congress. In fact, my wife has music that  he recorded, a song that maybe he will  sing here from the floor, but a man  truly ahead of his time, multitalented  and passionate about how we save the  environment.  Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you,  ",2009
461,40,2009-04-21,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," If you don’t mind, I  will confine myself to lyrics tonight.  Like you, I have noticed over the  years that industries that are about to  be regulated cry wolf and say that jobs  will be lost.  As I recall when seat belts were first  proposed for cars, the automobile industry said: Oh, you are going to put us  out of business. You are going to throw  people out of work. And, instead, it  created a whole new industry of building and installing and maintaining seat  belts. The same thing with air bags in  cars: Oh, you are going to put us out of  work. You are going to cause a big loss  of jobs.  And, instead, SRS and other companies sprang up inventing, designing, installing and maintaining air bags in  cars. The same thing goes for scrubbers  on coal power plants and so on and so  forth.  So I would like to speak as a member  of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee because the surface  transportation bill that we are going to  work on this year will be critical to  solving the climate change problem.  This upcoming surface transportation  reauthorization  is a historic opportunity to take us forward toward a 21st  century solution and a 21st century  transportation network and begin to  deal with climate change.  If this bill does not focus, not only on  building  and  repairing  roads  and  bridges, which is important and does  create jobs, but also on increasing the  share of  funding going toward mass  transit, then it will be a missed opportunity.  If the bill does not increase funding  for alternative modes of transportation  like bicycles and pedestrian walking  paths and intercity passenger rail, then  it will be a missed opportunity. If this  bill does not change the way we think  about  land use planning so that we  focus on smart growth, good land use  planning  principles  and  transit-oriented  development  and  complete  streets, we will have missed an opportunity.  And if this bill does not encourage  the use of renewable fuels on electric  vehicles and plug-in hybrids, it will be  a missed opportunity.  b2200  I must remark that a couple of weeks  ago I drove one of the test vehicles  that was here outside that gets 250  miles per gallon in the plug-in hybrid  version. And the pure electric version,  I’m sure you saw it here, I won’t mention the brand name because I don’t  want to be seen as endorsing a particular company, but we could find it  on the Internet with a little search.  The pure  electric version  currently  gets a 70-mile-per-hour top speed and  100-mile range, well within the commuting range and the speed necessities  of most commuters. So we need to look  at all these things that, hopefully, will  do that in this bill.  Furthermore, there’s a great opportunity not  just to mitigate climate  change  effects which have  environmental and public health benefits, but  also  in developing new  technologies  which  cannot  or  should  not  be  outsourced. We should be creating jobs  right here the United States and reinvigorating our economy. We, the country who put a man on the Moon, should  be leading the way in these new technologies and not conceding that lead,  new technologies to other countries.  So I will stay around to take part in  the discussion for a little while. But I  appreciate, Congressman BLUMENAUER,  your organizing this hour, and thank  you for inviting me to be a part of it.

464,61,2009-04-21,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, yesterday, I pointed out that the President’s war funding request contains up  to $80 million to close the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay. The  administration says Guantanamo will  be closed by next January. What they  haven’t told us is what they plan to do  with these killers once it closes. Well,  Americans want some assurances that  closing Guantanamo will not make  them less safe. Frankly, that is a very  important and understandable request.  Guantanamo currently houses some  of the most dangerous men alive. These  are men who are proud of the innocent  lives they have taken and who want to  return to terrorism. One person who is  there, and whom we don’t know what  we will do with, is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. We captured him while he was  planning followup attacks to 9/11, including plots to destroy a West Coast  skyscraper and to smuggle explosives  into New York. If we hadn’t captured  him, he may have succeeded in launching the same type of attack on the  west coast that he carried out on the  east coast. This is a man who brags  about decapitating the American journalist Daniel Pearl, with the following  quote:  ‘‘. . . with my blessed  right  hand.’’ How does transferring Khalid  Shaikh Mohammed make the country  safer?  Another person at Guantanamo that  the administration doesn’t know what  it will do with in 9 months is Ali Abd  al-Aziz Ali, who served as a key lieutenant for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  during the 9/11 operation. How does  transferring him make  the  country  safer?  Then  there  is Abd  al-Rahim  al-  Nashiri. He was al-Qaida’s operations  chief in the Arabian Peninsula and the  mastermind behind the attack on the  USS Cole which killed 17 sailors  in  2000. How does transferring or releasing  him make our country safer?  These are just 3 of the 240 terrorists  that the administration doesn’t know  what to do with. The one thing they do  know is that they claim they are going  to close Guantanamo in 9 months, even  though they can’t say yet whether the  alternative is as safe and secure. All of  this, despite the fact that after visiting  Guantanamo  for  the  first  time  recently, Attorney General Holder said  he was ‘‘impressed by the people who  are presently running the camp’’ and  that  ‘‘the  facilities  there are good  ones.’’  That was certainly my  impression  when I went there a few years ago.  The administration needs to tell the  American people what it plans to do  with these men  if  it closes Guantanamo. Two years ago, the Senate voted  94 to 3—94 to 3—against sending these  men  to  the United States. Foreign  countries have so far been unwilling to  take any of them in significant numbers—understandably. Even  if  countries were willing to take them, there  is an increasing probability that some  of these murderers would return to the  battlefield. The Defense Department  recently confirmed that 18 former detainees had returned to the battlefield  and said that at least 40 more are suspected of having done so. These are  people we have already released who  are back on the battlefield.  Earlier this year, the Saudi Government said that nearly a dozen Saudis  who were released from Gitmo are believed to have returned to terrorism.  The administration has made a priority of closing Guantanamo, but its  first priority should be to assure the  American people that the detainees at  Gitmo will never again be able to harm  Americans.  ENTITLEMENTSPENDING  Mr. President, I wish to say another  word in addition to my comments yesterday about the President’s welcome  gesture on wasteful spending. The Cabinet has been asked to find $100 million  in savings over the next few months  and this is clearly a step in the right  direction, but it is just a step. Current  levels  of Government  spending  and  debt are completely and totally out of  control and the threat of a fiscal catastrophe is very real. The only way to address this out-of-control spending is to  get at the heart of the problem, which  is entitlement spending. A lot of people  do not realize that nearly 70 percent of  the money  the Federal Government  spends every year is mandatory spending on very popular programs such as  Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,  and on the interest we have to pay on  the national debt.  Entitlements are the heart of the  problem. As Willie Sutton  put  it:  That’s where the money is. And if we  don’t find a way to address this spending, we will be in very serious trouble  as  a nation. Fortunately, Senators  GREGGand CONRADhave a proposal on  the table that addresses entitlement  spending head on, by  forcing Democrats and Republicans  to  come  together and make the kind of tough  choices necessary to steer the country  out of an otherwise inevitable financial  shipwreck. It deserves much more attention than it has received, and it deserves a vote here in the Senate.  Cutting $100 million in waste is certainly good, but let’s put it in context.  The amount of money the President  asked the Cabinet to save yesterday,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:19 May 02, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S21AP9.REC S21AP9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009

467,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK., Yes.  ,2009
468,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," I ask my colleague, if he  has a moment, to see whether we can  set a time for the vote with respect to  this issue.  ",2009
469,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK.," If I may respond  through the Chair, I have contacted  colleagues. We are still confirming at  what time they can speak. Several colleagues want to speak. We are working  on that right now.  ",2009
470,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," Does the Senator have a  sense of when we could try to come to  some arrangement? A lot of Senators  on both sides of the aisle are trying to  arrange schedules, and the majority  leader is trying to deal with the question of the legislative schedule. If we  can get a sense of that—I know the  Senator is trying to get at it. I think if  we could pin this down, that would be  helpful. If he could give me a sense of  how many Senators, when, and if we  will lock in their times and then lock  in a vote.  ",2009
471,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK.," I am contacting  colleagues now. We don’t have that officially tied down yet so that I can respond at this time. I appreciate my colleague  from Massachusetts  saying  that, as I understand, there will be a  hearing  on North Korean—not necessarily on the atrocities, although I  hope it will be covered, but also on possible sanctions on North Korea. I appreciate that is being worked on to address some of these concerns. I will be  raising, as well—while my colleague is  here—that we not put  in a  supplemental bill support for the North Korean regime that  is beyond humanitarian aid, particularly as these things  are surfacing now. I realize that is not  the Senator’s committee, but I want to  make my colleagues, who know the situation well, aware of these points that  I will be raising.  ",2009
472,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," Let me say that every  one of us shares the outrage at the type  of government and the way in which  the people of North Korea are oppressed. I commend the Senator from  Kansas for calling the country’s attention and the world’s attention and the  Senate’s at this moment to it. We will  have a hearing on May 6. It will be a  comprehensive  hearing  on  North  Korea. It will involve all of the issues  with respect to North Korea. We welcome that. That is an appropriate role  for us.  But it is also appropriate for us to  try to get this nominee a time certain.  He would like to leave for Iraq tomorrow. So we wish, if we can, to have a  sense of the timing on the vote. If we  can get an agreement here, maybe I  could—how many Senators are planning to speak on the Senator’s side of  the aisle?  ",2009
473,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, we  have three who are lined up to speak.  There are Senators MCCAIN and KYL,  who have scheduling issues later in the  day. That is what I am trying to get  firmed up. I am not trying to delay my  colleagues.  ",2009
474,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," I understood that Senator MCCAINwas going to try to speak  at 3:30, which is about 35 minutes from  now. We are prepared not to have any  further speakers on our side.  I will propound a request. I ask unanimous consent that we allow the Senator from Kansas to control the time,  but for, say, 10 minutes between now  and the hour of 5 o’clock, and that the  vote be at 5 o’clock. I ask for an order  to that effect.  ",2009
475,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  have to object at this time. I simply  don’t know when Senator KYL can  speak, and he desires to speak. Until I  can determine that, I cannot agree for  others of my colleagues.  ",2009

477,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," I respect that, but I also  know how the Senate works; I have 26  years here. I will come back. I have a  meeting going on now, but I will be  back in about 20 minutes. I hope we  can find Senator KYLbetween now and  then, pin down the time for him, and  get an agreement. I think it is important for the Senate to get its business  done. Is that agreeable to the Senator  from Kansas?  ",2009
478,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK., If we can locate  him and if there are not others.  ,2009
479,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY., If we cannot contact a  member of the Senate who is in the  leadership—surely we can find one of  the leaders of the Senate in 20 minutes.  ,2009
480,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK., I have said what I  know.  ,2009
481,75,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," I will be back at a quarter after, and I hope we can propound  an agreement at that time. I thank the  Senator for the interruption.  ",2009
482,75,2009-04-21,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  want to speak about another issue, because this caught a lot of what is involved here. This is a 2004 article called  ‘‘An Auschwitz in Korea.’’ I had hoped  my colleague could stay and hear this,  but he has to leave.  This is to the point raised by a number of people that this was kind of  quick and the problem with human  rights was not known as an issue in  North Korea, and that we don’t know  about it. Chris Hill steps in and he has  to make the call that we are not going  to pursue human rights, but we are  going to go completely after the nuclear issue.  This article is by Jeff Jacoby from  the Boston Globe. He puts it so well,  because it is to the point we have here.  He writes this:  Does  ‘‘never again’’ simply mean  ‘‘never  again will Germans kill Jews in Europe between 1939 and 1945?’’  Is that what ‘‘never again’’ means?  Obviously, that is not the case. We are  not going to let this sort of thing happen again on Holocaust Remembrance  Day.  That brings us to North Korea. In  2004, this author writes this. This was  in the press:  It is not exactly news that the Communist  regime of Kim Jong Il has sent millions of  North Koreans to early graves. Estimates  back to 1998 were that as many as 800,000  people were dying in North Korea each year  from starvation and malnutrition caused by  Kim’s ruthless and irrational policies. World  Vision, a Christian relief organization, calculated that 1 million to 2 million North Koreans had been killed by ‘‘a full-scale famine’’ largely of Pyongyang’s creation.  They created the famine and people  die off who don’t support the regime.  We have heard about that system before, and some of the purges that took  place in the Soviet Union.  The article also says:  Nor is it breaking news that North Korea  operates a vicious prison gulag—‘‘not unlike  the worst labor camps built by Mao and Stalin in the last century,’’ as NBC News reported more than a year ago. Some 200,000  men, women, and children are held in these  slave-labor camps; hundreds of thousands of  others have perished in them over the years.  Some of the camps are so hellish that 20 percent or more of their prisoners die from torture and abuse each year. The dead can be of  any age: North Korea’s longstanding policy  is to imprison not only those accused of such  ‘‘crimes’’ as practicing Christianity [one of  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:19 May 02, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S21AP9.REC S21AP9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009

484,82,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from New Jersey for a very  precise and important set of arguments  about why we ought to proceed forward, and I appreciate his taking time  to come to the Senate floor to do that.  Momentarily, it is my hope we will  be able to propound a unanimous consent agreement. We are just waiting, I  hope, for the word to come back from  Senator KYL shortly. I hope that can  come very quickly so there could be a  vote around 5:15 on this nomination.  Let me just say a couple of words  about a few of the things that have  been said. Obviously, we hope to be  able to divide up the remaining time  between us and then conclude the debate, but part of what the Senator  from Kansas has said, both this morning and this afternoon,  is that the  human  rights  envoy,  then  Jay  Lefkowitz of  the State Department,  was not invited to take part in the six-  party talks per an exchange that Senator BROWNBACKhad with Chris Hill—  with  Ambassador  Hill—before  the  Armed Services Committee.  Ambassador Hill has addressed this  issue, I have addressed this issue on a  number of occasions, and we have really laid this out. The full text of his remarks has  been  submitted  for  the  RECORD. In a nutshell, let me just state  one last time for the record exactly  what happened.  As Ambassador Hill made clear at  the  time,  his  promise  to  Senator  BROWNBACKapplied to the future negotiating sessions, except those specifically  dealing  with  nuclear  disarmament where the Human Rights Assistant  Secretary  had  no  portfolio  whatsoever. To make it clear, the Senator  from Kansas  somehow believes  that no matter what, Special Envoy  Lefkowitz should have been invited to  that, but that was not a decision that  was up to Ambassador Hill. Let’s be  clear about this. That was not Ambassador Hill’s decision to make.  The New York Times on January of  2008 reported that the decision about  who would attend the six-party talks  and what issues would be discussed was  made by Secretary Rice and the President. Here are the words of Secretary  Rice  speaking about Human Rights  Envoy Jay Lefkowitz as quoted by the  New York Times on January 23, 2008.  ‘‘He,’’ Lefkowitz, ‘‘doesn’t work on the  six-party talks.’’ This is Secretary of  State Rice talking, rebuking her own  Assistant Secretary.  He doesn’t work on the six-party talks. He  doesn’t know what’s going on in the six-  party talks and he certainly has no say in  what American policy will be in the six-  party talks.  That is exactly what Secretary Rice  said. So the Senator may have a quarrel but it is not with Ambassador Hill.  Secretary Rice was very explicit  in  that rebuke. Quoting Secretary Rice,  again from the New York Times, this is  what she said:  I know where the President stands, and I  know where I stand, and those are the people  who speak for American policy.  That is the level of the rebuke you  are talking about here. It is almost unprecedented,  frankly. And here  the  Senator is, trying to carry water for  this rebuked Assistant Secretary who  was inappropriately asserting himself  at that time. But regardless of whether  you think he should have been there or  should not have been there, it was not  Ambassador Hill’s decision to make. He  took daily instructions from the President and from the Secretary of State,  from the State Department. That  is  what a good diplomat and negotiator  at important talks like that does and  that is exactly what he did.  I ask unanimous consent the full text  of the article in the New York Times  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  Record, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 2008]  RICEREBUKESBUSHENVOYWHOCRITICIZED  POLICYONNORTHKOREA  (By Helene Cooper)  WASHINGTON.—Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza Rice, in a rare public rebuke,  has upbraided a White House envoy who  criticized United States diplomacy toward  North Korea that is aimed at coaxing the  North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons.  Ms. Rice said the official, Jay Lefkowitz,  President Bush’s special envoy on North Korean human rights, was not speaking for the  administration when he told an audience at  the American Enterprise Institute last week  that the United States ‘‘should consider a  new approach to North Korea’’ because the  current approach was unlikely to resolve the  issue before the end of Mr. Bush’s term in a  year.  Speaking to reporters aboard her flight to  Berlin on Monday, Ms. Rice sharply disagreed, and said Mr. Lefkowitz should stick  to human rights and leave the talks over the  North’s nuclear policy to her, Mr. Bush and  the other nations involved: Russia, China,  Japan and South Korea.  ‘‘He’s the human rights envoy,’’ Ms. Rice  said. ‘‘That’s what he knows. That’s what he  does. He doesn’t work on the six-party talks.  He doesn’t know what’s going on in the six-  party talks and he certainly has no say in  what American policy will be in the six-  party talks.’’  Mr. Lefkowitz, reached at his office in New  York, said he and Ms. Rice spoke on Friday  about the disagreement, and he described  their conversation as ‘‘very amicable, substantive and useful.’’  ‘‘I’m going to have a great deal more to  say about elevating  the  issue of human  rights in North Korea, which is clearly a priority for the president and Congress,’’ he  said.  The dispute comes at a time when nuclear  talks have stalled, with North Korea missing  a year-end deadline to disclose all of its nuclear programs. A debate within the administration has fractured along familiar lines,  with hard-line national security hawks in  Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at  the White  House  arguing  for  a more  confrontational approach with the North.  On the other side, Mr. Bush’s lead North  Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R.  Hill, backed by Ms. Rice, has argued that the  United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that was widely credited with bringing about an agreement last  year  intended  to eventually  lead  to  the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Ms. Rice said that Mr. Bush had ‘‘spoken  as to what our policy is in the six-party  talks.’’  ‘‘I know where the president stands,’’ she  added, ‘‘and I know where I stand, and those  are the people who speak for American policy.’’  ",2009
485,82,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," The second thing alleged here is somehow Ambassador Hill  failed to implement the North Korean  Human Rights Act. That is not accurate. Facts are facts. Facts, as has been  said many times, are stubborn things.  Consistent with the Human Rights Act,  Ambassador Hill secured the admission  of the first North Korean refugees into  the United States in 2006. He worked to  ensure the safe passage to South Korea  of asylum seekers from the North who  had been detained in other east Asian  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:19 May 02, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S21AP9.REC S21AP9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009

501,89,2009-04-21,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President,  I  have come to the floor to talk for a  moment  about  the  unprecedented  flooding that has occurred in the State  of North Dakota in recent weeks. My  colleague, Senator CONRAD, discussed it  some yesterday, and I want to discuss  it as well.  We have had flood disaster assistance  now approved for 38 of North Dakota’s  53 counties, and it has been the most  unprecedented,  unbelievable  flooding  we have ever seen in the State of North  Dakota. This chart I have in the Chamber shows, in red, the counties that  have been declared disaster areas as a  result of flooding. You can see it covers  nearly three-fourths of the State of  North Dakota. And we have had more  snow, more moisture, more difficulty,  more blizzards, and so on, and the rivers across our State have exceeded  their banks and threatened very dramatic flooding, which I am going to  talk about some today. But before I  talk about the water, I want to talk  about the people of North Dakota.  The unprecedented flooding that has  driven people  from their homes and  caused so much damage and so much  difficulty for so long has caused people  in North Dakota to come together to  do the most unusual things I have ever  seen.  At midnight one night, I peered down  the  stairs  of what  is  called  the  FARGODOME  to  see  this  large expanse. Inside this large dome building,  at near midnight, I peered down on  that floor, and there were thousands  and thousands of people on the floor of  that dome filling sandbags. They filled  31⁄2million sandbags in about 51⁄2days—  31⁄2million sandbags in 51⁄2days. And  they did not hire anybody to do that;  they just put out a notice on the radio  to say: We need people, and people  showed  up. The most  unbelievable  thing in Fargo, ND, was to watch what  they did with just the people power  that  showed up. No one  thought a  group of people could do that, but they  did—31⁄2million sandbags.

502,110,2009-04-21,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing the Pedestrian Safety  Enhancement Act of 2009 with Senator  SPECTER. This bill is designed to ensure  that those with limited or no vision are  able to identify electric and hybrid vehicles as they travel down the road. I  am a strong supporter of increasing the  number of electric and hybrid electric  vehicles on our roads because they will  limit our dependence on foreign oil and  help limit pollution. However, the silent operation of hybrid vehicles has  created a potentially hazardous situation for some pedestrians with limited  or no vision. Too often, vision impaired  individuals are unable to hear hybrid  cars as they pass by them. This makes  it more  difficult  for  them  to  get  around.  While I am thankful that there will  be less noise on the street, we should  be  fair to those among us who use  senses other than sight to navigate the  streets. The bill directs the Secretary  of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard  that provides for a means of alerting  vision impaired pedestrians of motor  vehicle operation. This bill  requires  that solutions to this problem are studied and the best of these solutions is  implemented in a timely manner.  I ask all my colleagues to support  this legislation.  By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself,  Mr.  REED,  Mr.  WHITEHOUSE, Mr. SCHUMER, Mr.  KERRY,  KENNEDY,  FEINSTEIN, Mr.  CARDIN,  Mr.  LEVIN, Mrs.  Mr.  Mrs.  and Mr. MENENDURBIN,  GILLIBRAND,  Mr.  DEZ):  S. 843. A bill to establish background  check procedures for gun shows; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.  ",2009
503,110,2009-04-21,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  rise because yesterday marks 10 years  since the shootings at Columbine High  School in Littleton, CO, and on this  10th anniversary, we need  to  speak  about the problems with our Nation’s  gun laws.  Whether  it  is Columbine, Virginia  Tech, Mexican gun trafficking or the  recent killings  in Pittsburgh, Binghamton, and Oakland we are reminded  over and over again that our gun laws  are not strong enough, and it is time  we said—not another day.  Not another day should we allow the  gun show loophole to stand.  Not another day should we allow gun  dealers to sell firearms without conducting a background check.  Not another day should we allow terrorists, criminals, gun traffickers and  the mentally ill to buy firearms.  It is as easy as ever for criminals to  buy guns—easier, in fact, than it is to  get a library card.  What happened at Columbine High  School 10 years ago was a tragedy none  of us can forget.  Two shooters went on a rampage and  killed 12 students and 1 teacher.  But here is what a lot of people do  not realize: all of the firearms used by  the shooters were bought at gun shows.  That means, because of the gun show  loophole, they were bought without a  background  check,  and  they were  bought ‘‘cash and carry,’’ no questions  asked.  Those 13 people never should have  died  because  those  teenagers never  should have had those guns.  Just think: the young woman who  bought the guns for the shooters said  she wouldn’t have done it had a background check been required.  In 1999, I introduced legislation to  close the gun show loophole and keep  guns from falling into the wrong hands.  In the aftermath of Columbine, the  Senate  passed my  legislation, with  Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-  breaking vote.  It was a great victory, but it was  short lived. The gun lobby stripped my  legislation in conference.  Ten years later, this gap in our law  still remains.  We were reminded of that last Thursday when we marked the second anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings.  In that tragedy, a mentally deranged  man killed 32 students and faculty in  the worst mass shooting in American  history.  The Virginia Tech shooter was able  to obtain his guns from licensed gun  dealers because the records of his mental illness were not in the background  check database as they were supposed  to  be. But  if  a  background  check  stopped him from buying his guns from  a gun dealer, he could have walked to  a gun show and purchased the guns  with no background check.  Yesterday we marked the 14th anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing—the Nation’s worst domestic terrorist attack.  The men responsible  for that despicable act frequently bought and sold  firearms at gun shows.  Gun trafficking to Mexico is another  reminder of the dangers of the gun  show loophole.  We know that as many as 30 percent  of the  firearms traveling across our  border into Mexico originate from gun  shows.  We have  an  opportunity  to  save  lives—and that is why I am reintroducing legislation today to close the  gun show loophole once and for all.  Closing the gun show loophole will  not adversely affect licensed gun sellers and it will not place a burden on  law-abiding gun owners.  It simply ends a dangerous, unnecessary exemption so that the Brady Law  is applied equally.  But  that difference—the difference  between buying a gun with a background check and not—is everything.  It is the difference between saving  lives and putting more at risk, between  keeping guns out of the wrong hands  and letting terrorists and others have  easy access to guns, and the difference  between upholding the rule of law or  allowing loopholes to undermine it.  Specifically, my  legislation would  take several steps to make gun show  transactions safer for all Americans:  gun shows are defined to include any  event at which 50 or more firearms are  offered or exhibited for sale. This definition includes not only those events  where  firearms are  the main  commodity  sold, but also other  events  where a significant number of guns are  sold, such as  flea markets or swap  meets.  Gun show promoters would be required to register with the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF,  maintain a list of vendors at all gun  shows, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge  receipt  of  information  about their legal obligations.  The bill requires that all  firearms  sales at gun shows go through a Federal Firearms Licensee, FFL. If a nonlicensed person  is selling a weapon,  they would use an FFL at the gun show  to complete the transaction. The FFL  would be responsible for conducting a  Brady  check on  the purchaser and  maintaining records of the transaction.  FFLs would be required to submit information including the manufacturer/  importer, model, and serial number of  firearms transferred at gun shows to  the ATF’s National Tracing Center,  NTC. However, no personal information  about either the seller or the purchaser  would be given to the ATF. Instead, as  under current law, FFLs would maintain this information in their files. The  NTC would request this personal information from an FFL only in the event  that a firearm subsequently becomes  the subject of a law enforcement trace  request.  I am proud to be  joined  in  introducing  this  legislation  by Senators  REED, WHITEHOUSE, SCHUMER, KERRY,  KENNEDY,  DURBIN,  LEVIN,  CARDIN,  GILLIBRAND, FEINSTEIN, and MENENDEZ.  Ten years ago we lost 12 students and  a teacher to gun violence in Littleton,  CO.

Alicia has earned the promotion to this distinguished post with more  than 22 years of  dedicated service  to her community and a  faithful commitment  to  the mission of Pilot  International.  Admired by peers in the Pilot Club of Valley  Forge for her willingness to provide countless  hours of volunteer service, Alicia has taught  4H students the craft of sewing, started and  supervised an after-school program  for  local  elementary school students and served several years on the board of a local Boy Scout  Troop.  She also has selflessly served her church  by teaching Sunday school, preparing children  for sacraments, caring for the linens and as a  member of the Finance Committee.  Alicia will become Governor of  the Northeast Potomac District during a ceremony on  May 3, 2009.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me today in congratulating Alicia Fox on  this tremendous achievement and recognizing  her outstanding volunteer spirit and drive  to  improve the quality of life in her community.  f  FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION  AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. DAVID WU  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 1, 2009  ",2009
505,117,2009-04-21,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention  and Tobacco Control Act.  Statistics are handed out on this floor like  candy. Because numbers are often passed off  as nothing more than empty words, we fail to  recognize how staggering  they are. For  instance, smoking-related diseases cause an  estimated  440,000 American  deaths  each  year. Smoking costs  the United States over  $150 billion annually in health care costs. And  a 2004 study by the CDC’s National Center for  Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion  found  that cigarette smoke contains  over 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known  to cause cancer.  Ninety percent of adult smokers are addicted to tobacco before they reach the age of  18; 50 percent before the age of 14. Currently  the average age of initiation to tobacco is 11.  48 million adults smoke in the U.S., which is  22.9 percent of the population overall, and 33  percent of youth currently smoke.  To be quiet honest Madam Speaker, these  statistics are more than staggering—they are  atrocious.  It was Irving Selikoff, a medical researcher  who co-discovered a cure for tuberculosis who  said, ‘‘Statistics are real people with the tears  wiped away.’’  Those real people are our parents and children, our  family and  friends, who suffer  the  consequences of addiction to tobacco. I want  my children to grow up healthy and to make  healthy decisions. To help that happen, H.R.  256 will put in place the proper authority for  the Food and Drug Administration to establish  regulations over  tobacco products. We need  the FDA  to protect our population  from  the  harmful effects of cigarettes and tobacco products by being able to provide sound, scientific  regulations governing these products.  Even with all the warnings, and the money  spent on education campaigns, kids are still  picking up smoking at  the alarming  rate of  3,000 a day in the United States.  The health concerns  that will  face  these  children are costly, painful, and deadly. But  they are also ultimately preventable.  I ask my colleagues  to please pass H.R.  1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.  f  TRIBUTE TO CAROL LAFLEUR  HON.

506,117,2009-04-21,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to share the inspirational story of Carol  LaFleur, a resident of Brooklyn Park, MN who  changed her life and is now working to change  others’ lives for the better as well. Mrs. LaFleur has experienced a great deal of hardship throughout her life, but after discovering  the gift of education, she completely  turned  her life around.  Mrs. LaFleur uses her  life experiences  to  guide others and advocate  for education.  In  her time outside of the classroom, she speaks  and mentors on issues of mental health, sexual abuse, and disability. In addition, she volunteers for these and multiple other causes.  She sets a great example for all Americans,  giving her  time without asking  for anything  back.  In addition  to all of her accomplishments  and hours of volunteerism, she has found an  outlet  in writing about her experiences. She  has been honored by  the Arts  in Recovery  Program, who chose her essay to be in its exhibit booth online and at  the St. Paul Art  Crawl.  Madam Speaker, Carol LaFleur is an inspiration, a positive influence for so many who  need hope, and a true public servant. She is  a great example of  the enduring American  spirit.  HONORING MAITLAND KEILER OF  SUMTER COUNTY  HON. GINNY BROWN-WAITE  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 21, 2009  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Maitland Keiler, one of my accomplished constituents who dedicated his  life  to  improving  health services in his community and beyond.  Mr. Keiler was born in 1933 in Royal, Florida  to Will and Melbira Keiler.  In  the early  1970’s, he moved  to Apopka, Florida where  he earned a living picking oranges. He then  met four Catholic sisters who had worked to  found a health clinic for farmers and migrant  workers in the area, the West Orange Farmer’s Clinic. Working with the sisters and at the  clinic began a new chapter in Mr. Keiler’s life.  He eventually became one of the first African-  Americans appointed to serve on the board of  the West Orange Farmer’s Clinic.  Wishing to bring similar services to his community which was also in dire need, Mr. Keilier  approached Mr. Ellery Gray, director of  the  West Orange Clinic, about opening a clinic in  Sumter County. In collaboration with the county, Mr. Grey and Mr. Keiler succeeded  in  opening ‘‘Project Health’’ in 1974. Once a simple, modest clinic, Project Health is today the  Thomas E. Langley Medical Center. The Center has expanded to more than 41,000 square  feet of combined medical, dental, behavioral  health, radiology, pharmacy and administrative  services  Madam Speaker, men  and women  like  Meitland Keiler are  the ones  truly making a  difference  in  their communities because of  their passion and their drive. Mr. Keiler’s story  should serve as an inspiration to others, and  I am proud to know that one of my constituents worked so hard to make his dream a reality and the lives of his fellow citizens better  and healthier.  f  HONORING DR.

508,124,2009-04-21,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to congratulate Chris Gatlin, RN, OCN,  MHA, a nursing director at the Baton Rouge  General, for being named 2009 Nurse of the  Year by the Louisiana State Nurses Association.  Chris  is a  long-time nurse at  the Baton  Rouge General,  and  her  colleagues  and  friends state  that she  is representative of a  true  leader. From her work as an oncology  nurse, to her service to those well beyond the  hospital walls, Chris demonstrates the art and  caring as a nurse by her promotion of this profession through example and participation.  In addition to being one of the most compassionate caregivers, Chris is involved with  many programs, projects, and  initiatives  related to oncology nursing. From promoting her  profession  through college classroom visits  and national speaking engagements, to teaching classes to help nurses at the Baton Rouge  General  receive  the highest certifications  in  oncology nursing, Chris is a constant advocate  for the profession and a mentor to many.  But one of Chris’ most important and meaningful achievements was spearheading an initiative to increase awareness about the management of pain for cancer patients. As an oncology nurse, Chris saw how pain affected the  daily lives of those suffering with this terminal  disease. With a simple commitment  to help  her patients, she shepherded resources and  stakeholders—creating the Louisiana Pain Initiative. Through this group, she secured grant  money from the Pain Foundation to conduct  the first Survey on Pain in Louisiana. She was  also able to gain support around the state and  participated  in countless  interviews  for  the  ‘‘Power Over Pain Louisiana Campaign.’’ Chris  continues to work closely with the group, making a difference  in  the  lives of many  in our  state.  Chris is also highly involved with the American Cancer Society (ACS). She participates  annually, usually as a  team  leader,  in  the  Relay for Life event and serves as a member  of ACS’s board of directors. She is also active  in the community by promoting skin and prostate  cancer  screenings, breast  self-exams,  lung cancer awareness, and smoking cessation education.  Anyone who knows Chris quickly learns of  her excitement and enthusiasm  for nursing  and zest  for  life. Colleagues at  the Baton  Rouge General look to Chris as an example of  how the power of one dedicated person can  change the world for many. And though Chris  would never seek out this type of recognition  for her amazing work, everyone at Baton  Rouge General believes she earns  the right  and privilege to be named Louisiana’s Nurse  of the Year.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Chris Gatlin for being named Louisiana’s  Nurse of  the Year. This  truly amazing and  selfless individual has proven that one person  can change the world for many.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE MILITARY  OFFICERS  ASSOCIATION  FEDERAL CHARTER ACT  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 21, 2009  ",2009
509,124,2009-04-21,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, today  I rise  to  introduce, along with my colleague  WALTERJONES, a bill to grant a federal charter  to the Military Officers Association of America.  The MOAA  is an  independent, non-profit,  non-partisan organization that plays an active  role in military personnel matters while working with Congress  to propose  legislation affecting our active duty, National Guard and  Reserve  forces,  the  retired community, veterans and survivors of the uniformed services.  The MOAA is the largest professional association for military officers and the fourth largest veterans group in the nation with nearly  370,000 members. Nonetheless, MOAA  remains the only major veterans organization in  the country without a Congressional Charter.  Although a Federal Charter does not confer  any specific rights or benefits, it provides public  recognition  to membership organizations  that serve the public interest. A Charter also  will enable some state-level MOAA affiliates to  represent veterans on Governor-level veterans  advisory councils  from which  they are presently excluded.  MOAA has established a distinguished 80  year history of service to the military community, veterans, survivors and their families by  offering career  transition assistance, military  benefits counseling, and educational assistance to children of military families.  I am proud  to stand  in support of MOAA  with my colleague Representative JONESand  with our Senate colleagues BILLNELSONand  SUSANCOLLINS, who introduced the bi-partisan  companion bill.  After eight decades of service to our men  and women in uniform, the MOAA richly deserves congressional support  for a  federal  charter—not only for their benefit but for the  benefit of  those whom  they serve and represent.

510,124,2009-04-21,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Dean Robert Rosen, outgoing Dean of  the  internationally acclaimed  UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television.  A world renowned archivist, recognized for his  contribution to the restoration and preservation  of films, Bob is to be commended for his work  in the preservation of this American art form.  Bob has dedicated  thirty years  to guiding  the growth of the UCLA Film & Television Archive. Evolving from a small study collection to  the world’s largest university-based holding of  original  film and  television materials second  only to the Library of Congress, Bob’s dedication has certainly paid off. He has cemented  his stature as an  international  leader  in  film  preservation, first as director of the UCLA Film  and Television Archive (1975–99) and since  then as Dean of the UCLA School of Theater,  Film and Television. Under Bob’s leadership,  the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at  the American Film  Institute was  founded.  His involvement in the field of film is extensive as he dedicates his time and efforts to  serving on numerous boards such as the executive committee of the International Federation of Film Archives and  the National Film  Preservation Board of the Library of Congress.  Along with Martin Scorsese, Bob created the  Film Foundation, and today he is the Chair of  the  Film  Foundation’s  Archivists  Advisory  Council. His interests extend beyond film with  his service as a Board Member of the Geffen  Playhouse and the Latino Theater Company.  His many contributions and commitment to  film preservation and  restoration have not  gone unnoticed. In 2008, he received the Film  Foundation’s John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America. His work has also  been honored  internationally,  including  recognition by the French government as an Officer of Arts and Letters and his receipt of the  International Documentary Association’s Career Achievement Award for Scholarship and  Preservation.  Madam  Speaker  and  distinguished  colleagues, I ask you to join me in saluting Dean  Robert Rosen  for his  impressive  tenure at  UCLA and for the indelible mark he has left on  the film industry.  f  RECOGNIZING JOHN M.

512,138,2009-04-21,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker, over  the past several years, Southeast Texas has  been the target during Hurricane Season. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit in 2006  and  the very  recent Hurricane  Ike  in September 2008. Not to mention Hurricane Gustav, which did not cause a disaster in Texas,  many believe it was just a trial run before Hurricane  Ike. Hurricane  Ike came along  two  weeks later on September 13, 2008.  These hurricanes have  taught emergency  management officials to be prepared in time of  a disaster. Through  their preparedness  they  are able to assist and help other individuals  evacuate  the city  in a  timely manner. The  most recent development is the Portable Inflatable Hospital presented by  the East Texas  Gulf Coast Regional Trauma Advisory. With  the help of the emergency management officials, numerous area hospitals and others, this  incredible development was established. State  and federal Grants help fund the hospital that  cost around 1.5 million. This portable hospital  is a great way for medical personnel to assist  patients during a disaster and for the patients  to get the quick response medical help they  need. The medical assistance can range from  distributing medications to on site emergency  care. The facility can operate as one or three  separate facilities. It is equipped with beds, living areas, and other units. This project has  had a great response from individuals willing  to donate, but still needs any help it can get  from our local Southeast Texans. The medical  personnel and emergency officials are very  grateful for this newly facility. It will be located  in Southeast Texas, but can be set up across  the state. The hospital will cost five thousand  dollars  to operate daily plus an additional  twelve thousand dollars to generate the portable hospital.

ENGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 21, 2009  ",2009
513,138,2009-04-21,Mr. ENGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor Mr. Jacob Tanenbaum, an outstanding  constituent and educator from the 17th Congressional District of New York, for his exemplary efforts in bringing real scientific research  to the classroom.  Jacob Tanenbaum, an elementary school  teacher at the South Orangetown schools in  Rockland County, New York, was chosen by  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Teacher at Sea Program to  participate  in a  two-week research cruise  in  the North Atlantic this past fall to study Atlantic  fisheries while aboard NOAA Ship HENRYB.  BIGELOW.  Embarking from Newport, Rhode Island, Mr.  Tanenbaum’s research cruise followed a track  off the United States’ northeastern coast. Mr.  Tanenbaum not only researched fisheries, but  also wrote a daily blog,  took photographs,  interviewed scientists, and engaged  in dialogue with his students, fellow teachers, and  the general public. Mr. Tanenbaum became  an  integral part of  the  research  team and  ship’s crew and established relationships that  will give him and his colleagues access to scientific resources for many years to come. With  his at-sea experience, Mr. Tanenbaum has  been able to enrich his curriculum and excite  his students about science.  In one of his blogs, Mr. Tanenbaum wrote,  ‘‘Through NOAA’s Teacher at Sea Program,  students are not  just  learning about exciting  research projects at sea, they are witnesses to  them, and on some level, participants in them.  The Teacher at Sea program is about something far more important than test scores and  text books. It is about inspiration and excitement.  Inspiring  learning and creating excitement about learning are not just simple hoped-  for extras in an educational setting—they are  the most essential parts of a culture of learning.’’  I congratulate Mr. Tanenbaum on his spirit  of adventure  in  the name of education, his  willingness to try new things, and his ability to  bring this experience back into the classroom.  NOAA’s Teacher at Sea program has afforded  Mr. Tanenbaum an unparalleled opportunity to  provide his students with hands-on scientific  education, grounded in his unique experience.  The lessons he learned on the BIGELOWwill  stay with Mr. Tanenbaum for the rest of his  teaching  career, acting as a  source  from  which he will always be able to draw inspiration and creativity.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  CONFLICTED  INVESTMENT  ADVICE  PROHIBITION ACT OF 2009  HON. ROBERT E. ANDREWS  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 21, 2009  ",2009
514,138,2009-04-21,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to introduce the ‘‘Conflicted Investment  Advice Prohibition Act of 2009, CIAPA, which  would  restore  the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act’s, ERISA, prohibition on  self-interested  investment advisers providing  advice  to employer-sponsored retirement accounts;  thereby, safeguarding  the  retirement  savings of millions of hardworking Americans.  On the eve of the inauguration of President  Barack Obama,  the Bush administration attempted to finalize a regulation concerning the  Employee Retirement  Income Security Act,  ERISA,  that  raised substantial questions of  law  and  policy. Essentially,  the  final  rule  issued would have allowed conflicted financial  advice to workers with regard to their 401(k)  and other types of defined contribution plans.  Fortunately,  thanks  to  letters of opposition  from Chairman MILLER and me, as well as  several other Members of Congress, as well  as consumer advocacy groups and several financial industry insiders who serve in the interest of investors, the Obama administration  has delayed the effective date of the regulation for further examination of its intent.  I believe in the value of providing American  workers with access to investment advice, so  long as  the advice  is  independent and  free  from conflict—serving  in  the  interest of  the  worker, rather than the interest of the financial  advisor. During a time where American workers have already lost $2 trillion in assets due  to last year’s market downturn, exposing their  hard-earned retirement savings to greater risk  by allowing advisers to offer them conflicted  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:14 Apr 22, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A21AP8.050 E21APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
515,2,2009-04-30,Mr.  PAULSEN.," Madam  Speaker,  more markets for our products mean  more jobs for Minnesotans and for all  Americans. That’s why I was pleased  that President Obama  recently  directed the U.S. Trade Representative  to  work  through  any  outstanding  issues so that we can move forward  with a Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The President  is  right: more  open trade is a win-win for both countries, and we need bipartisan action to  pass this trade agreement, but Congress’ lack of action has harmed U.S.  interests, and it has given a competitive advantage to other countries.  How can American businesses compete when the European Union, Canada, China, and Latin America countries have better access to the Colombian market?  Over 80 percent of U.S. exports of  consumer  and  industrial  products  would become duty free immediately,  but  instead, Congress’  inaction has  cost U.S. exporters more than $1.5 billion in tariffs to Colombia.  Madam Speaker,  let’s do what  is  right and quickly pass the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE  OF EVA A. VALENTINE  (Mr. HARE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2009
516,2,2009-04-30,Mr. HARE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to honor the life and service of  Ms. Eva A. Valentine of Rock Island,  Illinois. On March 27, 2009, Eva passed  away at the age of 87, surrounded by  loving family, friends and neighbors.  Eva was a devoted mother, wife, and  was an active member of the Rock Island community. She participated in  the American Legion Post 246 Auxiliary and the Moline Croatian Crest  Club. She also devoted many hours to  St. Mary’s Catholic Church and to the  Altar Society.  I had the pleasure of knowing Eva as  the mother of my friend, Wayne Valentine. I have many fond memories of  Eva as Wayne and I grew up together.  She was a reliable source of support,  and she helped me become the person  that I am today. I owe Eva my thanks  and my gratitude.  Eva will be dearly missed by her husband, John, by her son, Wayne, by numerous nieces, nephews, friends, and by  the Rock Island community. As we celebrate and remember her long life, we  are reminded of the important influence Eva was and will continue to be in  our lives.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring the  life of Ms. Eva A. Valentine.  f  BORDER MONEY GOING TO WRONG  PLACES  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
517,2,2009-04-30,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  Homeland Security is going to spend  $740 million to beef up legal ports of  entry into the United States. We absolutely need more border security. The  problem is the bureaucrats who have  probably never been to either of our  borders  are  sending most  of  that  money to little-used crossings, including one that just handles two cars and  sees only four people a day. Many of  these  37  crossings  that are getting  money average merely 50 cars and 85  people a day.  Contrast that with the Laredo-Nuevo  Laredo legal crossing. It is receiving no  additional money, and it is the largest  legal port of entry in North America. It  is vital to U.S.-Mexico trade. Over 7,000  18-wheelers a day cross that border in  each direction. Trucks wait 2 hours to  come into the United States. The vast  majority  of  these  trucks  are  not  screened due to manpower and money  issues.  Why not close the little used ports of  entry that are now receiving most of  the money and send the border agents  where they could do some real good, to  the port of entry where people and vehicles actually cross? But that would  be too logical for the D.C. bureaucrats.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  CREDIT CARDHOLDERS’ BILL OF  RIGHTS ACT  (Mrs. DAHLKEMPER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
518,2,2009-04-30,Mrs. DAHLKEMPER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support for H.R. 627, the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights.  As I’ve traveled across my district in  western Pennsylvania, I’ve seen firsthand how abusive credit card practices  can devastate families throughout this  country, especially during this recession. The time has come to end the unfair,  deceptive,  and  anticompetitive  practices by  credit  card  companies.  These include soaring fees, arbitrary  interest rate hikes, due-date gimmicks,  and the incomprehensible credit card  contracts that all Americans are familiar with.  The  Credit  Cardholders’  Bill  of  Rights offers an important opportunity  to protect consumers from these practices, and this legislation can’t come  soon  enough. With  consumer  credit  card debt approaching $1 trillion, we  cannot wait any longer to hold credit  card  companies accountable and  to  give American cardholders more control over their credit  limits. That’s  why I urge my colleagues to act today  and join me in passing the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights.  f  THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  FALL OF SAIGON  (Mr. CAO asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
519,2,2009-04-30,Mr. CAO.," Madam Speaker, on April  28, 1975, an 8-year-old boy was rushed  into an American C–130 to seek freedom in a foreign land. Two days later,  on April 30, the Communist forces rumbled into Saigon and marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in  the long and illustrious history of Vietnam.  Immediately following April 30, the  Communist government initiated one  of the most horrific cultural and political cleansings of our time. Hundreds of  thousands of religious, political, and  military leaders were thrown into re-  education  camps.  Approximately  300,000 people died at sea while fleeing  the horrors of this regime; and of those  who  remained,  thousands more died  from famine.  Madam Speaker,  today marks  the  34th anniversary of that dark day in  April when Saigon fell. The 8-year-old  boy of whom I spoke now stands before  you. I, on behalf of the 1.5 million Vietnamese  living  in the United States,  take this opportunity to remember all  who perished in the Vietnam conflict.  I urge my colleagues to work with  the Vietnamese communities around  the world to promote a free and democratic Vietnam.  f  MACKENZIE BROWN  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

532,23,2009-04-30,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of my amendment to ensure  that young Americans can continue to  access credit and begin to establish a  credit history and learn financial literacy.  I would  like  to  thank Congresswoman MALONEY and her  staff and  Chairman FRANK and his  staff  for  bringing this important consumer protection bill to the floor and for consideration of my amendment.  In my district of Colorado,  financially responsible  families who have  paid their bills and been careful with  credit have had the added insult of skyrocketing interest rates imposed by the  very banks who caused the injury of  this  recession  through  their mismanagement.  We need available credit and fair borrowing terms in order to restore our  Nation’s economic health. This bill is  good for consumers and, by reducing  defaults and increasing consumer confidence, it is also good for the financial  services industry. Equitable terms will  result  in on-time payments, making  bank balance sheets healthier.  Management of credit is a matter of  personal responsibility; however, to be  truly accountable, the rules must be  clear. The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of  Rights gives Americans the tools to be  responsible with credit, and I urge its  swift passage.  Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, it is important to recognize the professionals  in the lending industry who have been  the champions of their customers. In  Colorado, we have the Young Americans Center for Financial Education.  This bank for young people is teaching  the next generation how to use credit  wisely and teaches about business development and investment. Many other  banks and credit unions, realizing that  the informed customer is the best customer, have offered financial literacy  and counseling courses, and these efforts are to be applauded.  b1230  Across the country, brokerage firms  and even employers have taken action  to inform people about financial services. I want to commend these efforts  and encourage the entire industry to  follow the example of these leaders.  While regulatory reform  is  important, the blame for our economic woes  does not rest solely on the shoulders of  the  finance  industry or government  regulation. We must also aggressively  address our culture of financial illiteracy. According to the consumer financial literacy survey report released  this week,  41  percent  of American  adults would give themselves a C or  below for financial literacy. More troubling is the lack of knowledge about  credit among younger Americans. We  all know that the credit mistakes of  youth can carry serious long-term consequences. If we expect the next generation of Americans to use credit responsibly, we must ensure that they  are exposed to the tools of financial literacy at an early age.  It’s for this reason that I have offered  this amendment that will continue to  allow minors to have a credit card in  their name under the supervision of  their parent or guardian. Not only is  the practical  firsthand experience of  credit critical to financial literacy and  establishing  credit and personal  responsibility, but for many families it’s  also an important safeguard in emergency  situations. The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights is the beginning  of what needs to be a thorough discussion of making financial literacy universal. This economic crisis has created a new awareness of the  importance of financial literacy, and I urge  this Congress to support reforms not  only in regulation but in education to  ensure that familiarity of financial instruments give Americans of all ages  access to increased credit, homeownership, higher education, and are able to  build wealth.  Today as we recognize the  importance of financial literacy here on Capitol Hill, let’s put words to action for  young people back in our districts by  protecting their ability to be  introduced to credit.  I ask my colleagues to support my  amendment to ensure age-appropriate  access to credit continues to be the law  of the land, and I further ask my fellow  Members of Congress to pass this bill  to give our constituents the needed relief and reforms of the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights.  I once again thank Congresswoman  MALONEYand Chairman FRANK.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2009

The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from North Carolina.  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Minimum payment practices, which  often are deceptive at best and abusive  at worst, clearly contribute  to  the  problem of unmanageable debt. And  they need to be reined in. That’s exactly what the Price-Miller of North  Carolina-Moran  of  Virginia-Quigley-  Stupak-Sutton-Lowey amendment will  do. Our amendment would ensure that  consumers receive a warning of the  risks of making only the minimum  monthly payment and information on  the total cost of paying only monthly  minimum payments on their balance.  It would also require issuers to provide  quarterly  assessments  of  the  monthly payments that must be made  to pay off the current balance of the  consumer in 1, 2 or 3 years. And it  would establish consumer credit counseling and debt management services  through a toll-free telephone number.  Let me  assure  colleagues, we’ve  sought to ensure that these requirements are not too onerous for credit  card companies. For example, disclosure  requirements  target  only  consumers who regularly have not paid  their balances in full. Our amendment  will help consumers regain control of  cascading credit card debt.  So I urge colleagues to support this  amendment to provide American families with the tools they need to help  them manage their money effectively.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
540,30,2009-04-30,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Chairman, we  have no one to claim time in opposition.  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from North Carolina, who has  served with distinction on the Banking  Committee, BRADMILLER.  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, about 35 million Americans  just pay their monthly payment, the  minimum monthly payment on their  credit card every year. And some of the  opponents of this bill may have very  little sympathy for families that are  deep in debt. But as our economy has  produced billionaires who have done  nothing of any conspicuous value to society, there are millions of American  families that are working very hard  and struggling to get by, and it is very  tempting when  they’re doing  triage  with their bills and they know they  can’t pay everything, for their eye to  skip down to the minimum monthly  payment and just pay that. This bill  makes sure they know what the consequences of that are. This amendment  makes sure. It informs them of what  kind of debt they’re going to be in, how  much it’s going to cost them in interest, how long they’re going to be in  debt, how deep the hole will be, and  what it is going to take to get out.  I applaud Mr. PRICE for his efforts.  And I urge all Members to vote for this  amendment.  Mr. PRICE  of North Carolina.  I  thank my colleague. I would like at  this point to yield 1 minute to a new  colleague,  Representative  who is already distinguishing himself  as a protector of the consumer.  ",2009
541,30,2009-04-30,Mr. QUIGLEY.," I rise in strong support of this amendment because today  QUIGLEY,  the average American can apply for a  credit card anywhere, at a grocery  store, at an airport, a ballpark, even  college campuses. It all seems so easy.  Unfortunately,  the  terms  of  the  agreements aren’t so easy.  In some  cases,  terms have  become  so  complicated  that  the average consumer  cannot always know what they’ve gotten themselves into.  Now more than ever, Americans are  turning to their credit cards to get  them through the end of the month,  and in turn, the U.S. credit card debt  has reached an all-time high.  Meanwhile, almost half of Americans  carry a balance and have no idea how  long it’ll take to pay that down. The  Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights will  protect  consumers  from  predatory  practices, and this specific amendment  will give them the ability to pay down  their debts.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’  on this amendment and the underlying  bill.  ",2009
542,30,2009-04-30,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.  The amendment would  require additional  disclosure  information on credit card statements. While most cardholders know it takes  a great deal of time to pay off a balance by  making only the minimum payment, most do  not understand the total additional costs they  will pay. This amendment would change that.  Based on industry norms of an 18 percent  APR and 4 percent minimum payment requirement, a cardholder will spend 87 months and  $1,515 paying off a balance of $1,000 if making only the minimum payments. The finance  charges are more than 50 percent of the actual balance.  Our amendment would  require  that each  statement have a warning on minimum payments and that every quarter, cardholders receive a statement  that  lists  the number of  months it would take to pay the entire balance  if only  the minimum payments are made,  along with the total cost of doing so. Those  statements would also have  to  list  the necessary payment to pay off the balance in 12,  24, and 36 months, as well as a toll-free number  to  receive  information about accessing  credit counseling and debt management services.  Credit cardholders have a right to know the  real cost of making only minimum payments.  For that reason, I urge your support for the  amendment.  I would also like to voice my strong support  for the underlying bill. In recent months, Congress has been dominated by rescue and economic recovery legislation. But there are few  better ways  to  instantly help hard-working  Americans than to end costly, abusive credit  card practices.  For  too  long, banks have saddled cardholders with deceptive marketing and  fine  print. The New York Consumer Protection  Board reports that credit card complaints comprise more than a quarter of those it receives,  and cards with debt have an average balance  of $5,700.  Because of unfair practices, one hidden fee  snowballs  into ballooning  interest  rates and  thousand dollar balances  that many  families  struggling  to get by with  today’s economic  challenges cannot afford.

As the current legislation stands, it  leaves inactivated credit cards off of  credit reporting altogether. The legislation would allow a potential identity  thief to apply for and obtain numerous  credit cards in someone else’s name,  accruing massive  lines of credit, all  with  the  intention of opening each  credit card at once and simultaneously  spending massive amounts of that victim’s money and then disappearing, as  often is the case, which ruins the victim’s  credit history and oftentimes  costs the victim thousands of dollars.  My amendment ensures consumers  are aware of credit activity made in  their name by removing the requirement that open lines of credit are not  reported to the credit bureaus until the  issued credit card is activated.  Now, identity theft is a real problem.  As an individual who has had my identity stolen, I can tell you that it is also  a very costly problem. Eight million  Americans were victims of  identity  theft  in 2005, and over 2 million of  those 8 million victims were victims  because new accounts were opened in  their names that they were not made  aware of.  The Federal Trade Commission also  states that a quarter of those victims’  problems were  exacerbated  because  they were not made aware of the problems for over 6 months. The underlying  legislation will only exacerbate that  without this amendment.  The Federal Trade Commission goes  on in the report that they encourage  consumers  to  stay vigilant  in protecting  their  identity  through  two  ways; one is monitoring accounts that  you didn’t open and debts on your accounts that you can’t explain. Well,  Mr. Chairman, my amendment does exactly that by ensuring consumers continue to have the information about  these accounts that would otherwise  have been applied in their name but up  until this point would not be noted on  their credit account. Under the 2003  Fair Credit Reporting Act passed by  Congress, consumers are allowed this  information free of charge. And with  the amendment I offer here today, they  will be given that information in advance of any adverse credit effects that  a potential identity thief could be trying.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  I  I  ",2009

547,37,2009-04-30,Mr. GUTIERREZ.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 2 minutes.  The bill prohibits a creditor  from  providing  information  about  a new  credit card to consumer reporting until  the consumer uses or activates  the  card. I think the intention is excellent.  I don’t know that you are going to  reach it through this amendment.  I am going to look forward to speaking to the gentleman. And as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial  Institutions, I look forward to working  with him to make sure that we actually reach your goal. I think credit  card companies should be able to allow  that information to be removed. Moreover, the reporting agencies should remove that information, and it should  be done quickly and swiftly, and we  should look at measures to do that.  I am not going to oppose or ask people to oppose this particular amendment here this afternoon. I just want  to share with the gentleman that I am  going to vote ‘‘yes’’ on it—and hopefully we won’t have a recorded vote and  it will become part of the bill. We can  then work on it. And if we can’t, I  would suggest to the gentleman that  we sit down and figure out a way to get  there, just in case I’m wrong, you’re  right; you’re wrong,  I’m  right. We  should continue this conversation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

550,37,2009-04-30,Mrs. MALONEY.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I am generally in support of what my colleague from Illinois  is attempting to do, but I do have concerns that too  few consumers would  take advantage of this provision or  even know that  it was available to  them. I am going to be supporting your  amendment, but I would like to work  with you in further refining it.  I know the main concern that has  been raised about this provision has focused on preventing fraud. And I fully  support efforts to prevent fraud, and I  am willing to work with you going forward to ensure that consumers know of  their right to reject the card and have  this  information  removed  from  the  credit report.  I would also like to take this time to  explain why this provision was added  to the bill and why I believe it is necessary in one form or another.  Right now, consumers generally do  not know the full terms and conditions  of their credit card until they have  been issued the card. And once a card  has been issued, the card is reported on  the consumer’s credit report, regardless of whether the consumer uses the  card or not. The bill would allow an  issuer to report a consumer’s application for a credit card, but would not  allow an issuer to report the approval  of the credit card to the credit bureaus  until the card has been activated or  used.  Consumers  should  not  have  open  lines of credit listed on their credit report if they have no intention of ever  using the card. And while I appreciate  the gentleman’s amendment and will  maintain  this going  forward,  I  just  want to ensure consumers receive adequate disclosures relating to this. And  so I will be supporting your amendment, and we can help work on further  disclosures.  ",2009

558,44,2009-04-30,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, I am  here this afternoon to strongly oppose  the  Bush-negotiated  Panama  Free  Trade Agreement. We should not even  be considering  this agreement until  Panama fixes its outrageous banking  secrecy, its offshore tax haven, and financial service deregulation policies.  Just when we thought we heard almost everything that there is to know  about AIG’s bailout and bonuses, many  of you may not know AIG  is suing  United States taxpayers, claiming  it  overpaid U.S. taxes on activities  in  Panama.  Panama is a country which applies  low to no regulations and taxes on  firms registered there. AIG wants to  get back those taxes it dodged with its  Panamanian front.  Panama hides its tax liabilities and  transactions behind banking  secrecy  rules. The United States and other  firms can create unregulated subsidiaries with ease in Panama. According  to the State Department, Panama has  over 350,000 foreign-registered companies. AIG is very keen on tax havens  like Panama.  The New York Times just ran an article about how AIG is currently suing  the United States Government for over  $306 million in back taxes it claims it  does not owe because of the Panamanian  company  entitled Starr  International Company, otherwise known as  SICO.  SICO is AIG’s largest shareholder. It  is also the manager of a compensation  fund for AIG employees who are paid in  AIG shares. SICO’s chairman is former  AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg. The  same company that got the government bailout money and used taxpayer  dollars for outrageous bonuses is now  demanding twice the amount of bonuses in paid back taxes.  If you aren’t already angry about the  greed of AIG executives, the fact that  they are using Panama’s tax haven status as a way to sue the American taxpayers  for back taxes  is completely  outrageous. The Bush-negotiated Panama Free Trade Agreement would  make matters worse. It promotes the  offshoring of investment by providing  special treatment for firms who are in  Panama.  At a time of severe economic downturn and when the government is asking the United States taxpayers to foot  the bill for Wall Street’s mess, the last  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—HOUSE April 30, 2009  thing we need to do is pass a trade deal  negotiated by the Bush administration  that promotes offshoring, tax dodging,  and privileges for foreign investors.  This is simply outrageous. As elected  officials of  the people here  in  the  United States, we ought to have transparency in what is going on; and that  transparency  has  not  been  there,  whether it is the bailout legislation or  whether it is looking at the Panama  trade negotiated under the Bush administration which will be a tax haven  for companies who are registered  in  Panama.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  any Panama trade deal that has been  negotiated by the previous administration. It’s wrong. It’s outrageous, and it  is not the right thing to do.  f  b1600  ",2009

Under a previous order of  the House,  the gentleman  from  North  Carolina  (Mr.  JONES) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2009
560,44,2009-04-30,Mr. JONES.," Madam Speaker, I rise  with sadness at the news that this administration intends to follow the broken trade agenda of the previous administration by pushing Congress to  approve the United States-Panamanian  Free Trade Agreement.  How many American jobs must be  lost, how many businesses must be  closed, how many towns across this Nation must be hollowed out before the  government realizes that our trade policy is broken? We have had 15 years of  the NAFTA-based  trade model  on  which the Panamanian agreement  is  based, and the results are in: we now  have a $127 billion annual trade deficit  with Mexico and the other 15 nations  with which we have free trade agreements. Since the passage of NAFTA,  the United States has lost 4.5 million  manufacturing jobs, over 364,000 in my  home State of North Carolina alone.  We are in the worst recession since  the Great Depression. Unemployment  is rising and it may soon be over 10 percent. The last thing this country needs  is another free trade agreement that  will cause more good-paying American  jobs to be outsourced.  Most of us would agree that America  will not recover until we reduce our reliance on imports and produce more of  what we consume right here at home.  The insanity of this agreement is that  it will do just the opposite. In fact, this  agreement actually obligates U.S. taxpayers to fund a New Committee on  Trade Capacity building, one of the primary goals of which, according to CRS,  is to help Panamanian businesses in  ‘‘increasing  exports  to  the United  States.’’  Well, isn’t that nice? At a time when  this government is running a $2 trillion  annual deficit, this agreement will use  U.S. taxpayers’ money not to help U.S.  companies but  to help Panamanian  companies take market share and jobs  from domestic employers.  One  last  point, Madam  Speaker.  President Obama campaigned on and,  in my opinion, carried several States  because of his pledge to stop the incentives for companies to outsource jobs  and dodge U.S. taxation by moving operations offshore to tax-haven jurisdictions like Panama. Unfortunately, this  trade agreement would tear that pledge  to pieces.  The reality is that Panama is known  internationally as one of the leading  tax havens in the world. Corporations  from the United States and around the  globe set up shop in Panama in order  to dodge taxes in their home countries.  Sadly, this agreement does nothing to  stop that activity.  Madam Speaker, this agreement  is  bad for America, especially at this perilous economic time  for our Nation,  and I would encourage the administration to rethink its position before it  asks Congress to approve it.  And with that, Madam Speaker, before I close, with our men and women  fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, I ask  God to please bless our men and women  in uniform, and I ask God three times,  God please, God please, God please continue to bless America.  f  ",2009

What  they go  through  every day you probably don’t realize,  and we can’t tell you at all, but it is  tough duty. Anyone serving down there  is doing the country a great service.  Having said that, I understand the  need to change the image of the country. I have been one of the Republicans—a military lawyer for 25 years—  who understands the way we conduct  this war determines whether we will  win it. The high ground in military operations is usually a physical location.  When you are in a battle or a war, you  try to get the high ground, because  that  is the best place to  fight the  enemy from. In this war, it is an ideological struggle, so the high ground is  the moral high ground. It does matter  what we do.  My goal for America is to be the best  we can be. Our enemies—al-Qaida and  other groups—are some of the most  barbaric people in the history of the  world. But here is what it comes down  to. When we capture one of them, it becomes about us. They will cut people’s  heads off in the most brutal fashion,  abuse and humiliate people. They don’t  give  trials. They are not  reasoned.  They are barbarians. The fact that we  choose a different way is not a weakness, it is a strength. Trust me, if we  are going to lead the world to a better  way, we need to show the world a better way. And there is a better way.  In World War II, we had thousands—  350,000, I think—of German and Japanese prisoners housed  in the United  States, Nazis and Japanese prisoners  committed to our destruction. We held  them here under our value  system,  under the Geneva Conventions, in communities all over America. The Nazis  and the Japanese were a tough crowd.  When those prisoners were released,  those who were released, they went  back to their country with a view of  America that helped us form the modern Japan and Germany.  Some of the people we are talking  about at Guantanamo Bay are subject  to war crimes trials. So I am urging  the President to leave on the table the  military commission option. We can  reform it, but let’s not criminalize this  war. They are not accused of robbing a  liquor store. These are not common  criminals.  Under domestic criminal  law, you  cannot hold someone forever without a  trial, nor should you. But under the  law of armed conflict, if you catch a  member of the enemy force, you can  keep them off the battlefield as long as  they present a danger. That has been  military law forever.  I believe we would be better off if we  look at the people who are members of  al-Qaida at Guantanamo Bay as enemy  combatants, part of an unorganized militia, military organization bent on our  destruction, and they are a part of the  enemy force, not some common criminal. We can keep them off the battlefield as long as necessary, but we have  to do it within our value system.  I am urging the President that  if  someone at Guantanamo Bay is subject  to a war crimes trial, let’s don’t go to  Federal court, as we did with the blind  sheik trial in the nineties, which was a  disaster. Let’s put them in a military  tribunal and give them justice through  the military legal system of which I  have been a part for 25 years.  I can tell America one thing: The  judges, the lawyers, and the jurors who  wear the uniform of the United States  are the best among us. These are the  same people who administer justice to  our own troops. It is a great place to  conduct a  trial because we can do  things for national security in a military setting that we cannot do in Federal court. But I can assure you, justice will be rendered and people will be  treated fairly. The courts-martial we  have had, the commission trials we  have had at Guantanamo Bay, we have  seen sentences that make sense.

581,100,2009-04-30,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, no one  knows the man about whom I am going  to speak better than the Presiding Officer, but  I wish to talk about Tom  Strickland. I can say without reservation or hesitation that Tom Strickland  is a good friend and a tremendous public servant. He will be a great Assistant  Secretary  for Fish and Wildlife and  Parks. That is a fancy name. Basically,  what he will be is Ken Salazar’s chief  of staff. Ken Salazar depends on him  and will depend on him even more after  his confirmation.  Tom Strickland went to college at  Louisiana State University where he  The  was a  football player—quite a good  athlete—before returning to his native  Texas to study law. He graduated from  the University of Texas Law School  with honors and went to work for the  Governor of Colorado.  As Governor Lamm’s chief policy adviser in a State where protecting natural resources is a top priority, Tom  Strickland worked often with the Interior Department he will now help lead.  Even after Tom joined the private  sector, he continued to advance many  environmental and natural resources  issues on a voluntary basis. He is especially proud of helping to create the  Great  Outdoors  Colorado  Program  which has protected hundreds of thousands of acres of Colorado’s beautiful  wilderness and wildlife.  Tom is a well-known and successful  lawyer in Colorado. President Clinton  appointed Tom to be a U.S. attorney  for Colorado in 1999. In a turn of events  no one could have anticipated, he was  sworn  in the day after the terrible  tragedy at Columbine High School just  outside Denver. The 10th anniversary  was observed with sadness  just  last  week.  Tom Strickland has been a managing  partner of an internationally respected  law firm and the executive vice president of a major health care company.  He has been very successful personally.  He accumulated some wealth, but because of his belief in public service, he  accepted his friend Ken Salazar’s call  for assistance to become part of the  Obama administration.  I admire his  willingness to  leave behind the  lifestyle he has acquired to serve his country once again.  Tom’s hometown newspapers called  him tough and effective. He will certainly be both of those as Secretary  Salazar’s right-hand man  in the Department of the Interior.  Tom Strickland is a strong environmentalist who understands the importance of investing in renewable energy  and making America more energy efficient. He also appreciates our environment for its many splendors. Tom and  his wife, Beth, are well on their way to  achieving a goal they set to visit every  national park in America.  It is fitting that someone with such a  great  appreciation  for  our Nation’s  natural wonders will be responsible for  protecting and  improving America’s  National Park Service.  Once Tom Strickland is confirmed,  our country will be in a better place.  I note the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

584,100,2009-04-30,Mr. UDALL  of Colorado.," Madam  President, today, I rise to support the  The  confirmation of fellow Coloradan, Tom  Strickland, to be the next Assistant  Secretary  for Fish and Wildlife and  Parks for the Department of the Interior.  As chairman of the National Parks  subcommittee,  I  am  particularly  pleased to support the nomination of  Tom Strickland  for Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks,  because he has had a long history of activism on behalf of protecting national  an State parks.  You will excuse me for indulging in a  bit of home State pride when I say how  great it has been to see so many Coloradans going to work for the Department in the Federal Government that  has so much influence on the economic  life of the West.  I think it speaks highly of the motivational leadership of both Secretary  Salazar and this nominee to be the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife  and Parks, Tom Strickland, that so  many of their fellow Coloradans have  voluntarily left the best State in the  Union to work in Washington.  I know that Tom Strickland will be  an excellent Assistant Secretary at the  Interior.  He has an exceptional track record of  leadership both as an attorney, as a  businessman, as a civic leader and as  someone dedicated to public service.  He also has an  extraordinary wife,  Beth, who is inspirational in her own  right.  Before  coming  to  Interior,  Tom  worked in both the public and private  sectors.  He served as U.S. attorney for the  District of Colorado from 1999 through  2001, and has been a partner at several  law firms, including Hogan & Hartson  in Colorado.  From 1982 to 1984 he served as the  chief policy adviser for Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm, advising the  Governor on all policy and intergovernmental issues, and from 1985 to 1989, he  served on, and chaired, the Colorado  Transportation Commission.  Tom graduated, with honors,  from  Louisiana State University, where he  was an All-SEC Academic Football Selection, and he received his J.D., with  honors, from the University of Texas  School of Law.  I think it is clear that I have known  Tom Strickland over many years.  Our work together has largely been  in the public arena, where Tom—working with Secretary Ken Salazar—led efforts in Colorado to pass the historic  ‘‘Great Outdoors Colorado’’ program,  which dedicates State lottery money to  the  acquisition  of  public  lands  for  parks, open space and conservation.  Tom  is also an accomplished outdoorsman,  and  while  we  haven’t  climbed mountains together—at least  not the 14,000 foot kind—we both have  a love for the out-of-doors and the history, people, and  landscapes of  the  West.  I think this love for the land is what  motivated Tom to public service in the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:08 Jun 07, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S30AP9.REC S30AP9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009

586,107,2009-04-30,Mr. DEMINT.," Madam President, in a  moment I would like to bring up an  amendment, but in deference to Senator DODD, I wish to wait for him to be  back on the floor. In the meantime, I  would like to explain amendment No.  1026 and talk about it briefly until the  Senator returns.  We are all well aware of the bailout  bill that was passed last October. It  had one purpose, at least as that purpose was described to us, and that was  to purchase what they called toxic assets that were clogging up the credit  system. That $700 billion was then used  in other ways, and I believe unconstitutionally, to loan money to banks, insurers, auto companies, and to actually  turn those loans into preferred stock,  in some cases.  It now appears the administration is  going to take this a little bit further.  We have seen the hiring and firing of  executives. We have seen the Government, in effect, break contracts that  were established in the private sector.  We see the Government continuing to  use this TARP money to gain more and  more control over private sector industries, particularly the financial industries.  The administration appears now to  have a plan that would swap this loan  money in the form of preferred stock  for common stock, which means we not  only own but we have voting rights  and, in some cases, controlling interests in General Motors. My amendment  addresses specifically financial institutions, but we are talking about financial, auto companies, and other aspects  of  our  economy  using  this TARP  money in ways that were totally different than we ever imagined.  My amendment addresses specifically  banks. It would prohibit the Federal  Government from converting preferred  stock to common stock and basically  taking ownership and control of banks  across the Nation.  Many banks that participated in the  TARP funds suggest they were pressured to take it when they did not need  it. Many banks now say they would  like to give it back, and they are not  allowed to give it back. We need to  back the Federal Government out of  our private sector financial system and  set up a good system of laws and regulations so it can work in a way that is  transparent, honest, and good for the  American people. But we don’t need  the Federal Government to own our  banks and to try to run the day-to-day  business in our banks, just like we do  not need the Federal Government to  own General Motors and to run General  Motors.  My amendment would address, specifically, the financial institutions in  our country and prohibit the use of  TARP funds to be translated into common  stock  ownership  and  voting  rights.  Madam President, I yield the floor  and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

596,107,2009-04-30,Mr. DODD.," Madam President, as I  said a moment ago, we already have a  lot of amendments filed on this bill. I  can tell my colleagues and those who  are following this debate, this bill is  critically  important to our  financial  institutions. They have been waiting  weeks for this bill that Senator SHELBY  and I put together. I am not, in any  way, suggesting the amendments being  offered are not motivated by the best  of intentions, but the net effect of it is  to virtually bring down this bill. I say  to my colleagues,  I know  they are  hearing from others across the country  who have been waiting for this bill to  come up, to be considered, and moved  along. There is no way we can spend  the amount of days now that may be  confronting us with the list of amendments to go forward.  The  leadership—and  I  agree with  them on this—needs some clarity. If I  am going to be faced with a stack of  amendments being offered, then I am  going to have to, as the leadership said,  take this bill down and maybe in the  fall at some future date get back to it,  if at all.  That is a tragedy and unfortunate because it is an important matter. It is  widely supported across the country. It  is essential in many ways we get it  done. I wish for my colleagues to know  it  is not  aimed  at  any  particular  amendment. It is not suggested their  amendments are not well motivated.  But when you load up a bill such as  this with that many amendments, it  makes  it  impossible to get the  job  done.  I objected to laying aside the pending  amendment because we have several  amendments now pending. We will try,  over the coming day or so, to see if we  can resolve some of those amendments,  maybe accept some. I have to speak  with, of course, my colleague from Alabama, Senator SHELBY, to see if there  is agreement on some of the matters or  some modification to make them acceptable.  I suggest to my colleagues, any additional people coming over to temporarily  lay aside the pending amendments, that I will object to doing that  until we get clarity and try to clear  out  the  underbrush  to  determine  whether we bring down the bill, which  I will do, or to get a reasonable number  of these amendments which we can  handle to go forward. One or the other.  For those who are following this debate, the possibility of this bill being  taken down is very real. I hope those  who are interested in this bill will notify their respective Members who wish  to offer amendments and suggest there  may be a better time for those amendments to be offered.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

598,114,2009-04-30,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  happy  to have  this opportunity  to  honor the many accomplishments and  contributions  of my  good  friend,  Marilyn Bergman. Marcelle and I have  had  the  pleasure  of knowing  both  Marilyn  and her husband Alan  for  years. They are as accomplished songwriters as I have ever met. For the past  15 years, Marilyn has served as the distinguished president and chairman of  the board of the American Society of  Composers, Authors and Publishers, a  position never before held by a woman.  Marilyn’s list of achievements is vast  and impressive. Her work as a champion of the arts has brought about  many important changes. She was instrumental  in developing  ‘‘A Bill of  Rights  for  Songwriters  and  Composers’’—an initiative designed to raise  public awareness of  the  tremendous  contribution and rights of those who  make music. In addition, she has gone  to great lengths to support and promote the work of female songwriters.  This month, Marilyn will step down  from her position as chairman of the  board of ASCAP and will move on to  the next phase of her career. I know  that she will bring the same commitment to excellence and vitality to all  of her future endeavors and Marcelle  and I wish her only the best.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of an April 8, 2009 ASCAP press release  describing Marilyn’s work  be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From an American Society of Composers,  Authors, and Publishers Press Release on  Apr. 8, 2009]  MARILYNBERGMANTOSTEPDOWNASPRESIDENTANDCHAIRMANOFASCAP AFTER 15  YEARS  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK: April  8,  2009:  Three-time Academy Award-winning songwriter Marilyn Bergman today announced  her decision to step down as President and  Chairman of the Board of ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers). Her successor will be elected by the  ASCAP Board of Directors during their next  meeting later this month.  Bergman was the first woman to be elected  to the ASCAP Board of Directors and was  named President and Chairman of the Board  in 1994. She will continue to serve as an active Board Member.  Commenting  on her  decision, Bergman  said: ‘‘I am grateful to have had the honor of  serving as the President and Chairman of  ASCAP  for 15 years, and am exceedingly  proud of all that was accomplished during  my tenure. I will continue to be a passionate  advocate for all music creators through my  work on the ASCAP Board of Directors. But  in terms of the Presidency itself, I see that  now is the right time to step down.’’  Bergman noted that she and her writing  partner and husband, Academy Award-winning songwriter Alan Bergman, have a number of new projects in the works which require her focus. ‘‘Alan has always been supportive of the time that my ASCAP Presidency required. But with so much exciting  work before us, I feel it’s time that I fully  devote myself to my first calling: writing. So  I look forward to shifting my energy back to  our work, while having the privilege to continue to serve ASCAP and my fellow music  creators.’’  The Bergmans have just completed work  on Steven Soderbergh’s film, The Informant,  with composer Marvin Hamlisch, and are  currently working on two musical theatre  projects, one with Marvin and one with  Michel Legrand. They are also at work on  Visions of America: A Photo Symphony Celebrating the Sites and Songs of Democracy  with renowned photographer Joseph Sohm  and composer Roger Kellaway. This was  premiered at  the Kimmel Center-Verizon  Hall on January 25, 2009 in Philadelphia with  Peter Nero and the Philly Pops.  A Strong Legacy of Advocacy, Education  and Growth  Bergman’s 15-year tenure as President and  Chairman  of  the Board  of ASCAP was  marked by a series of noteworthy achievements, all of which have had a positive and  lasting impact on music creators.  As a passionate voice  for the rights of  music creators, Bergman has a strong presence on Capitol Hill. She helped lead ASCAP  to several major legislative victories, including most notably the Supreme Court’s decision in 2003 to uphold the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which extended  copyright protection an  extra  20  years—to the life of the author plus 70 years.  Other legislative highlights include:  Helming ASCAP through the modernization of the Federal consent decree that governs ASCAP’s operations.  Leading ASCAP’s  lobbying  effort  that  helped secure the passage and signing of the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998—  bringing the U.S. into line with World Intellectual Property Organization treaties and  strengthening music copyrights on the Internet.

Chris began his career in 1970 as a controller at the Miami Air Traffic Control Center.  He has since served in various management  positions in the FAA’s Southern, Central and  Great Lakes Regions. In April 2005, he was  asked  to handle  two  regions—Central and  Great Lakes. This resulted  in a  twelve-state  span, and was a  first  for  the FAA. He was  also  responsible  for such high volume and  high visibility facilities as Chicago O’Hare.

WILLIAM D. DELAHUNT  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 2009  ",2009
601,156,2009-04-30,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today so that my colleagues in the House of  Representatives can join me in congratulating  the Town of Truro, Massachusetts on  the  300th anniversary of  its  incorporation. Since  its founding, Truro has enjoyed a reputation as  a diverse and culturally rich town, whose welcoming  residents  and  awe-inspiring  landscapes are famous throughout New England.  Truro’s history harks back  to November  1620, when the Pilgrims visited the area while  their ship,  the Mayflower, was anchored  in  what is now Provincetown Harbor. It was here  that the Pilgrims found their first fresh water,  and on Corn Hill, overlooking Cape Cod Bay,  the voyagers found a cache of seed corn belonging to the natives which they stole to provide seed  for  their own spring crop. Determining that the land here was unsuitable for  their purposes, the Pilgrims continued up the  coast of  the Cape  to present-day Eastham  and then ventured across the Bay to Plimoth.  On July 16, 1709, the Town of Truro gained  its independence. Formerly a part of Eastham,  the nascent Town encompassed  the district  previously known as Pamet.  During the Revolutionary War, Truro’s militia  demonstrated remarkable skill and bravery in  keeping the British at bay. Once, the members  marched in a circular formation behind a barrier dune to convey the impression that there  was a large force assembled ready to defend  the  town. At  the  time, Provincetown Harbor  was controlled by the British, and there was  no protection for Truro save its own meager  militia.  Truro has a  long and distinguished seafaring history, and at one time had a shipyard  which produced  large vessels  in  the Pamet  River basin. Truro whalers sailing from other  ports ventured as  far as  the Arctic and  the  Falkland  Islands. Ultimately,  the Town  of  Truro’s  intrepid and expert whalers helped  spur an  industry  that became profitable and  culturally significant  throughout coastal New  England.  In fact, much of Truro’s economy was once  dependent on  the  sea. Truro’s men were  whalers, and the shipyard built large commercial vessels  to sustain  their activities. There  were several try works in town to render the  whale blubber  into  lamp oil, and salt works  dotted  the  shores  and  hillsides,  providing  much-needed  salt  to  preserve  the  catch.  These industries—along with subsistence and  commercial  farming—have  been  replaced  largely by  the seasonal  tourist  industry  that  currently fuels the local economy.  Today, slightly more  than 2,100  residents  call Truro home year-round. During the summer months, the tiny Town’s population swells  by an estimated 17,000 to 18,000 people anxious  to experience  the breathtaking scenery  for which Truro is known. More than half of its  landmass  is within  the Cape Cod National  Seashore. Truro’s beaches stretch unbroken  between its borders, offering water access for  swimming, fishing, and boating.  The first lighthouse—what many consider an  icon of Cape Cod—was built in Truro at Highland  in 1797. At  the  time,  the numerous  shoals off the ‘‘great backside’’ claimed many  ships as the prevailing winds and waves drove  vessels to the shore. This original lighthouse  was declared unsafe  in 1857 and a new  tower, still standing and still in-use, was built  to replace it.  Truro, with  its  glorious  sunsets;  noisy,  storm-surf-beaten  beaches;  tranquil,  sunny  berry-laden hills; deliciously refreshing  fresh-  water  springs;  adventuresome  paths;  and  acres of protected National Seashore  land,  has been home or temporary haven to politicians, musicians, puppeteers, pirates, poets,  and ordinary folks. Its people are hardy and  resilient. Tradesmen and professionals, artists  and writers, bards and photographers, fishermen and farmers, retirees and schoolchildren  all  contribute  to  the unique  fabric of  the  Town’s community. Some grew up here; many  others have chosen this special place as their  home.  It  is with pleasure and pride  that  I  join  Truro’s residents on this auspicious day to celebrate all the achievements the Town has accomplished, and all  those  to come. Happy  birthday, Truro. May the years ahead be ever  prosperous and bright.  f  CONGRATULATING  PAUL  GIBLIN,  PATTI  EPLER,  AND  RYAN  GABRIELSON  RECIPIENTS  OF  THE  2009 PULITZER PRIZE FOR  LOCAL REPORTING  HON. HARRY E. MITCHELL  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 2009  ",2009
602,156,2009-04-30,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to congratulate three Arizona journalists,  Paul Giblin, Patti Epler, and Ryan Gabrielson,  for earning the most prestigious honor in their  profession, the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Local  Reporting. Their hard work and dedicated effort on behalf of The East Valley Tribune are  deserving of  recognition and  should be a  source of pride for the people of Arizona.  The Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting was  first awarded in 1948 to honor journalists who  display  innovation and  knowledge of  their  communities while reporting on important local  issues. The Pulitzer Prize Committee offers  each winner a $10,000 award and a commemorative certificate, but more important is  these journalists have earned the respect and  admiration of their peers and the public.  Paul, Patti, and Ryan have set a new standard for all Arizona journalists with their commitment to excellence through their exhaustive  in-depth reporting on the impact of immigration  enforcement in Arizona. Despite facing tough  conditions with  the downsizing of  the newspaper  industry—both Paul Giblin and Patti  Epler have since been laid off by The Tribune—these  individuals have reminded us all  that  investigative  journalism  is still vital  to  shedding  light on and  informing  the public  about significant  issues  that  face  the nation  today.  It is only the fourth time in Arizona’s history  that a local media organization has won a Pulitzer Prize. More significantly,  it  represents  only the second occasion that a Pulitzer Prize  has been awarded in Arizona for reporting.  Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Paul, Patti, and Ryan’s achievement  and their continued service to journalism in the  public interest.  f  ADRIAN MURPHY  HON.

ROBERT WEXLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 2009  ",2009
605,163,2009-04-30,Mr. WEXLER.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to  take a moment  to  recognize  the Florida  Legislature for passing the Dori Slosberg and  Katie Marchetti Safety Belt Law yesterday, a  law giving police the power to stop motorists  for not wearing seat belts. I believe this law is  a great step forward in the effort to reduce the  numbers of tragic deaths and injuries throughout Florida and should serve as an example  for other state governments to follow in ensuring all Americans are safer on our roads.  This measure was long championed by Irv  Slosberg, a  former state representative  from  Boca Raton whose 14-year-old daughter, Dori,  was killed  in a 1996 car crash on Palmetto  Park Road. This accident claimed the lives of  five teens and left four others, including Dori’s  twin sister, with serious injuries. It is unfortunate that such a tragedy needed to occur for  people in our community to take notice of the  need to amend the law to ensure people are  wearing their seat belts, but Irv Slosberg deserves a tremendous amount of praise for his  dedication  to ensuring other  families do not  suffer from such a tragedy.  Along with his efforts  in  the Florida State  House to introduce this bill, Irv Slosberg also  introduced the Dori Slosberg Driver Education  Safety Act, which became  law  in Florida  in  2002 and allows Florida counties to fund driver education programs by adding a surcharge  to traffic tickets. In addition, recognizing that  teen traffic crashes are the number one cause  of death in Florida, Irv Slosberg also founded  the Dori Slosberg Foundation, with a mission  statement to educate the public about the importance of traffic safety; promote the usage  of safe driving habits, especially seat belt  compliance and proper child restraint devices;  support and advance driver’s education programs nationwide; assist  the Florida Department of Transportation to ensure a safe driving environment on our  roadways; and distribute tools to both teens and seniors to help  them drive safely. These initiatives, along with  his personal dedication  to  the  issue of road  safety, have no doubt saved and will continue  to save countless lives in our community.  As a co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety, I understand the  impact road crashes have on the global community, and while we must continue to work to  establish protocols with nations around  the  world  to reduce  the number of road deaths  and injuries globally, we must also set an example here in the United States by passing  laws to ensure safety belts, which have been  credited with saving countless lives since they  were made standard  in U.S. automobiles  in  1968, are being used by all who get behind  the wheel, especially our children.  I want to once again congratulate the Florida Legislature for passing this bill, and I look  forward to Governor Charlie Crist’s signing this  into law in the near future. I also want to once  again  extend  my  appreciation  for  Irv  Slosberg’s efforts, both while he served in the  Florida Legislature and as a member of the  South Florida community, to ensure our loved  ones remain safe on the roads.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE  CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 2009  ",2009
606,163,2009-04-30,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of the Local Law Enforcement  Hate Crimes Prevention Act (H.R. 1913). This  bill makes a profound  statement  that  this  country will not tolerate violence motivated by  bigotry and  ignorance against  its citizens.  I  commend Chairman CONYERS for bringing this  legislation to the floor.  The message of this bill is clear: the United  States will not  tolerate hate crimes. These  crimes are unlike other violent acts of randomness. Targeting people because of their race,  religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender or  disability is a form of domestic terrorism. Such  violent crimes send a chilling message to entire communities  that  they are not welcome  and  that  intolerance and  ignorance  is alive  and well.  Since 1991, the FBI has received more than  118,000 reports of hate crimes and we know  that crimes of this nature are frequently underreported. Current  federal  law covers crimes  committed based on a person’s race, color, religion, or national origin. H.R. 1913 extends  federal protection to include hate crimes committed because of a person’s gender, sexual  orientation, gender identity, or disability. This  bill allows the federal government to provide  needed  federal resources  to state and  local  law enforcement officials  to prosecute hate  crimes and also authorizes grants to law enforcement agencies  that have  incurred expenses  investigating  and  prosecuting  hate  crime cases.  Some opponents of H.R. 1913 have suggested that this bill legislates against thoughts  and ideas. This is absolutely false. H.R. 1913  provides  local  authorities  more  effective  means to prosecute violent acts of hate, not  thoughts or speech. In fact, this bill explicitly  includes First Amendment free speech protections for persons accused of acts of hate.  My first vote as a member of the Minnesota  House of Representatives was for equal rights  on housing and employment for the gay, lesbian,  bisexual  and  transgendered  (GLBT)  community. As a Member of Congress, I have  now voted for similar federal four times. The  Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act must become law so that all Americans can  fully participate  in and enjoy  the  rights of a democratic society.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  f  RESTORING THE PARTNERSHIP  FOR COUNTY HEALTH CARE COSTS  HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 30, 2009  ",2009
607,163,2009-04-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to introduce a bill to address two  matters that are critically important to the future of this country: health care and the health  of our local economies.  In almost all states, an inmate in a county  jail or  juvenile detention  facility  loses  their  Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP or SSI benefits  during  their  incarceration—even  if  they have  not been convicted of a crime. The United  States leads the world in the number of people who are incarcerated and federal law requires government entities to provide medical  services  to all  inmates. High  incarceration  rates,  chronic  conditions,  substance abuse  treatment, mental  illness, and aging prison  populations have contributed  to  the  rise  in  health care costs for inmates.  Madam Speaker, providing health care for  inmates constitutes a major portion of local jail  operating costs. Nearly two thirds of all jail inmates are awaiting court action or have not  been convicted of the crime they have been  charged with. Over half of jail inmates who receive financial support from government agencies prior to their arrest have physical and/or  mental health problems. Requiring county governments  to cover health care costs  for  inmates who have not been convicted. This  places an unnecessary burden on local governments, which have been negatively  impacted by recession, widespread budget deficits, and cuts to safety-net programs and other  essential services.  Stripping  inmates of Medicare, Medicaid,  SCHIP and SSI benefits also violates the presumption of innocence which is at the heart of  our criminal justice system. The failure to distinguish between persons who are awaiting  disposition of charges and persons who have  been  duly  convicted  goes  against  the  foundational tenets of our justice system.  Disadvantaged  populations  are  further  harmed by this situation. Low-income and minority populations are often unable  to post  bond, which would allow them to continue to  receive benefits from the federal government.  The facts are clear and all too familiar. Black  men are  three  times more  likely  than Hispanics and five times more likely than whites  to be in jail. Black women are more than twice  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:33 May 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K30AP8.011 E30APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
608,170,2009-04-30,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  today  in strong support of H.R. 1913,  rise  the  Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation  because we must do all that we can to protect  those who are injured because of their gender,  sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.  Hate crimes can occur in any community—  even one as wonderful and diverse as mine.  On July 4, 1999—when we should have been  celebrating the welcoming and embracing traditions of our great country, my district was  rocked by  the killing spree of  the white supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. This  madman left us grieving for Ricky Byrdsong, a  former Northwestern University coach, a well-  known community  leader, a deeply religious  man, a man who was committed to his family.  His only crime was the color of his skin—he  was African-American. Smith also murdered  Won Joon Yoon, an Asian American student  from Indiana.  The bill we are considering today takes an  important step toward making America a more  just society, by closing a glaring loophole in  our justice system that prevents the Federal  Government  from prosecuting cases where  women, gay, transgender or disabled persons  are victims of bias-motivated crimes for who  they are. These crimes not only devastate victims and their family and friends, but they devastate the community to which the victim belongs by creating fear and intimidation. Hate  crimes chip away at the very foundations of  what  it means  to be an American—that all  people are created equal and are afforded the  same freedoms and protections.  America must no longer ignore hate crimes  of any kind. Everyone, regardless of race, sexual, orientation and gender identity, must be  equal in the eyes of the law. The passage of  H.R. 1913 will send the powerful message that  America stands  for  tolerance and  inclusion,  and is opposed to prejudice in all its forms. I  want  to  thank my good  friend, Congresswoman TAMMYBALDWIN, and the entire LGBT  Equality Caucus for their tireless work to get  this bill passed and urge my colleagues  to  vote ‘‘yes’’ to H.R. 1913.  f  CREDIT CARDHOLDERS’ BILL OF  RIGHTS ACT OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON. THOMAS E. PETRI  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 2009  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration of the bill (H.R. 627) to amend  the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair  and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, and for other purposes:  ",2009
609,170,2009-04-30,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Chair,  I am disappointed  that Congressman MURPHYand I will not have  the opportunity to offer our amendment to the  Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights Act which  would require credit card companies to report  on marketing agreements with  institutions of  higher education and alumni associations. The  amendment also would direct the Government  Accountability Office to analyze and report to  Congress  the  impact of  these arrangements  on student credit card debt. To that end, today  we will be introducing this amendment as a  stand-alone  bill,  the Student Credit Card  Transparency Act of 2009.  According  to a recent study, students are  now graduating with an average credit card  debt of more than $4,100, up from $2,900 just  four years ago. The average number of cards  per student has grown to 4.6, with over half of  college students reporting  they have  four or  more cards. The combined  impact of credit  card debt and growing student loan debt can  greatly limit a student’s future career choice.  Furthermore, compounding debt from late payments and high penalties can  further  jeopardize a young person’s  financial  future by  making it difficult to take out their first mortgage, buy a car or even rent an apartment.  As I’m sure we all know through our own  experiences or through our children’s, college  students have become prime targets for credit  card marketing  campaigns. Most  students  enter college without a credit card and are  quickly saturated with e-mails, direct mailings  and on-campus solicitations to sign up for their  first credit card. A recent report by the U.S.  Public Interest Research Group revealed that,  of the students they surveyed, 80 percent said  they had received mail from credit card companies. Students reported receiving an average of nearly  five mailed  solicitations per  month. In addition, 22 percent of students reported  receiving an average of nearly  four  phone calls per month from credit card companies.  While the practice of targeting college students may not be much of a surprise, students  and parents may be alarmed  to  learn  that  many colleges, universities and alumni associations have entered  into  lucrative agreements with these companies to allow exclusive  marketing of  their cards.  In  these arrangements, schools receive large cash payments  in exchange for handing over their students’  contact information—such as address, e-mail  address, and telephone numbers. These confidential agreements may also go further and  give companies exclusive face-to-face access  to students on campus, such as during sporting events or at the student union. Some provide  the university or alumni with additional  money based on a percentage of purchases  using the card.  Despite  the  fact  that hundreds of schools  throughout  the country have such arrangements, very little is known about them. Last  year’s ‘‘pay to play’’ scandal in the guaranteed  student loan program exposed the practice of  lenders and financial aid administrators putting  their own  interests ahead of  their students’  when  it came  to compiling  their  ‘‘preferred  lender  list.’’ While  arrangements  between  credit card companies and schools don’t necessarily mean the student’s financial interests  are being harmed, I believe it is imperative to  have at a minimum a better understanding of  these arrangements. For instance, are schools  and associated  foundations making arrangements with companies that offer the best rates  for their students?  This bill simply seeks greater transparency  by requiring credit card companies  to report  these arrangements. Then Congress, students  and parents will be able  to  judge whether  these agreements reflect the best interests of  students or that of the school or related institution.  I am happy  to have  the support of  the  United States Students Association, USPIRG,  Consumer Federation of America, National Association of College Admissions Counselors,  and  the American Association of Collegiate  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:33 May 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30AP8.037 E30APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
610,177,2009-04-30,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the  Telephone Excise Tax Repeal Act of 2009,  which  I  introduced  today  along with Mr.  THOMPSONof Pennsylvania. The telephone tax  is deceptive, archaic, unfair and regressive.  This tax was first imposed in 1898 to fund  U.S.  involvement  in  the Spanish American  War. That conflict is long over, and now elimination of this tax is long overdue. But it is not  for want of trying.  Similar pieces of legislation have won bipartisan support  in previous sessions of Congress—127 cosponsors in the 110th Congress  and 220 in the 109th Congress—but have routinely been stalled. Let’s not let that happen  again.  I suspect many Americans would be surprised to learn that they are paying a three  percent tax on their local telephone, toll, and  teletype exchange services. As an excise tax,  there is no direct payment made to the government;  the  tax  is collected by  the phone  companies and remitted to the federal government.  Although  the amount  is  itemized on each  phone bill, it is one of many taxes, fees and  surcharges  listed and can be easily overlooked on the multiple pages of an average  telephone bill.  With advances in technology, this tax has  become punitive for those without the ability,  financial means or desire to upgrade their telecommunications services. Cellular phone and  long distance landline telephone services were  exempted from the tax in 2006. Bundled services that do not differentiate between local and  long distance services, such as Voice over  Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, also are exempt. The only service still being subjected to  this antiquated tax is local telephone service,  which is the predominant means of communication used by  the disabled,  lower-income  families and senior citizens.  Eliminating  this  regressive  tax would be  consistent with  the actions we already have  taken so far in this Congress to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax relief to hard  working Americans.  I ask my colleagues  to  join us in hanging up on the telephone tax.  f  HONORING DANIEL C. GILLIAM  HON. C.A.

612,4,2009-05-13,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, Americans  are an optimistic people. That was confirmed yesterday when results came  out showing that Americans believe, by  a 2–1 margin, that we will grow clean  energy jobs by the millions when we  adopt a clean energy bill in this House,  and they are right.  We should be optimistic that we are  going to build electric cars and sell  them to the rest of the world, not just  China. We ought to be optimistic that  we are going  to build concentrated  solar energy technology and sell it to  the rest of the world.  We ought to be optimistic that we  are going to build the electric batteries  that will fuel our cars and help make  our grid more responsive.  This is the optimism that those of us  have who are going to pass a clean energy bill this year to make this happen.  Here is another reason for optimism.  Yesterday we reached a consensus in  the House Energy and Commerce Committee. With broad  swathes of  the  country,  the  south-north  industrial  egg, we have reached a consensus that  we are going to grow jobs everywhere  in this country because we are the optimists, and the optimists are going to  win this clean energy debate.  f  REFORM OUR HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

And when we do, I hope there is one  prerequisite, one standard that we can  all agree on, and that is the essential  fact that we need to make sure that  every American has health insurance.  Yesterday, on  television,  I  saw a  commentator arguing against health  WE CAN’T CONTINUE TO DEPEND  ON MIDDLE EAST OIL  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
614,4,2009-05-13,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I have  been here for about 20 years now and I  have been through various crises, in  the 1970s with energy and gas prices  and, of course, one that we just faced  within the last year or so.  The bottom line is that we need energy independence. We can’t continue  to depend on Middle East oil. At the  same time we have a global climate  crisis. Anyone who denies it is just kidding themselves.  So basically what we are doing here  in the House is coming up with a bill  that will probably come to the floor  within the next 2 weeks that tries to  achieve energy independence and also  addresses the problem of global warming, but at the same time creates a lot  of jobs. Because as we move towards renewables, whether it be solar or wind  or geothermal, there are a lot of jobs in  research and development. There are  jobs in actually building those facilities. There are jobs in trying to create  more energy efficiency.  And these jobs that would be created,  these are the kinds of high-technology  jobs, if you will, as well as construction jobs, that we really need, because  a lot of people are out of work and are  not working  in  similar  industries.  Their activities can be basically transferred to these new kinds of job opportunities.  So I want to stress that this energy  bill is a job creation bill.  f  b1030  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF  H.R.  2187,  21ST  CENTURY  GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT  ",2009

634,18,2009-05-13,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, and Members of the  House, the 21st Century Green High-  Performing Public School Facilities  Act is exactly what the Federal Government should be doing.  We have seen now over the last year,  and in some cases a little longer, and  for the foreseeable future, that the tax  resources of local school districts, cities, and counties have plummeted because of the foreclosure crisis that confronts this Nation and because of the  financial  scandals and  the  financial  collapse of our institutions across this  Nation. We have seen that credit is not  available. The  school districts  that  have voted  for bonds have had difficulty in getting those bonds to market so that they can engage in the construction. And we  see,  in  fact,  the  backlog of repairs to schools, renovations, modernizations of schools and  school facilities is starting to lag.  We also know and we understand that  for the foreseeable future, unemployment will continue to go up in this  country, at a diminished rate, but we  still know half a million people a  month are losing their jobs. Auto sales  are down because American  families  are trying to save more because of the  recession, the depression we are  in.  They are trying to take care of their  needs, so school districts are denied  those resources as are States.  So what the Federal Government is  doing in this time of emergency is trying to say that we will join with you in  a partnership based upon the priorities  of locally elected school boards, of superintendents of schools, for the repair  and restoration of schools that are so  necessary  in so many areas of this  country. If a school board or if a school  district doesn’t need the money, they  need not take it. We hope that they  wouldn’t because maybe it can go to  another school district that might need  it more. But the fact of the matter is,  these repairs and restorations, and if  we use green technology and use the  guidelines of the green standards, not  only  can  repair  and  restore  these  schools, they can make them much  more efficient in the use of energy and  the use of water and the use of natural  daylight so students will have a better  learning environment and better opportunities at learning.  Yes, the data  is pretty darn clear  that in those kinds of facilities students do have a better opportunity in  learning the material that is presented  to them in that environment than they  do in an old and run-down facility that  is crumbling and bathrooms that are  not safe and can’t be used and windows  that are not replaced.  Yes, that may not sound  like the  local school district that some of you  represent, but it sounds like a lot of  the local school districts that a lot of  us represent, and those school districts  are doing all that they can. People are  voting for bond issues and paying higher taxes, but the fact of the matter is  they don’t have sufficient resources to  do that. That does not mean that we  should just sentence those kids to a  second-class education, to deny them  educational  opportunities,  because  when we do that, we then spill over  into the national interest of this country, and that  is to make sure that  every child receives a first-class education, that every child at the end of 12  years has the opportunity to choose a  career or schools or schools and a career in whatever combination, but they  are prepared to do that.  And we know from all of the surveys  that it is far more difficult for young  children to learn in dilapidated, ill-repaired, badly  restored  schools when  they are trying to get down the basics  of their education.  So this is a Federal partnership. In  some  cases,  local government  joins  with private sector money to repair  and restore schools and provide new  technologies. We want to join in part of  that. You can say this is the Federal  taking over the role. It is not taking  over any  role. This  is  insignificant  compared to the efforts being made by  local governments. We are simply saying we think this can be catalytic in  terms of getting some of these projects  done at this particular time and for the  foreseeable future so that we can ensure our students have an opportunity  to do that.  b1300  I want to thank the foresight of Mr.  KILDEE, not only  the  subcommittee  Chair, but the author of this legislation, Mr. CHANDLER, Mr. LOEBSACK,  who worked with local districts, who  worked with local schools, who looked  at examples of what had been done to  make a more efficient use of those  local dollars, of Federal dollars, of education dollars, to bring that together  and  try  to  build  high-performing  schools.  We want to make the same decisions  for these schools that so many in the  private sector are making about their  renovation, the renewal, the repair of  commercial  facilities,  of  facilities  throughout our communities where the  real estate industry is saving billions  of dollars by greening those buildings,  where we’re saving energy, where we’re  saving water—in States like California,  those two things are very important—  and providing a safe environment for  children. That’s why we should pass  this legislation.  H.R. 2187 requires local educational agencies to ensure a full and open competition for  qualified bidders. We expect that process to  maximize the number of qualified bidders to  include  local, small, minority-owned, women-  owned, and veteran-owned contractors, and to  do so without diminishing or precluding  the  local educational agencies’ ability to seek out  responsible contractors by,  for example,  requiring contractors to participate in bona fide  apprenticeship training programs and to demonstrate  other  legitimate  responsibility  and  qualification standards. Such requirements can  be used to ensure high-quality work and successful project delivery as well as foster good  training and employment opportunities in local  communities.  I would like to yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from  Nevada, a member of the committee  and a strong supporter of this legislation (Ms. TITUS).  ",2009
635,18,2009-05-13,Ms. TITUS.," Thank you very much,  Chairman MILLER, for your hard work  on this legislation. I certainly am supportive of it. I want to add some provisions to it that will be brought forward  in an amendment later.  As an educator myself, I believe that  it is important that we have safe and  healthy schools because only in those  environments can children learn better, and certainly that is all our goal.  I am pleased to be supportive of this.  ",2009
636,18,2009-05-13,Mr. MATHESON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of H.R. 2187, the 21st Century Green  High-Performing Public School Facilities Act,  which will help modernize many of our nation’s  schools.  I would  like  to  thank my colleague  from  Kentucky—BEN CHANDLER—for his sponsorship of this legislation. I believe it will help to  ensure that our children can learn in healthier,  more cost effective, and more energy-efficient  schools.  An investment in education and educational  facilities is critical. As the father of two young  boys, I want to know that they will receive a  quality education  in a safe school building.  Too many of our nation’s schools are outdated, and some are even unsafe.  I would also like to thank Chairman MILLER  for including my amendment to this bill in the  manager’s amendment. My amendment will  allow schools to prioritize projects that eliminate  asbestos,  polychlorinated  biphenyls,  mold, mildew,  lead-based hazards, or other  known carcinogens.  Extensive research has shown that children  and  teachers  perform  better  in  ‘‘green’’  schools. Our children already encounter many  challenges, and we should do everything we  can to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for them.  ",2009
637,18,2009-05-13,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.," Mr. Chair, I spoke  on the floor earlier today in support of H.R.  2187: The  21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act and  the  amendment  that  I  cosponsored with Mr.  (AL), Ms. KOSMAS (FL)  and Mr.  CUELLAR(TX).  Because my time on the floor was limited, I  was unable  to explain my reasons  for supporting this legislation in detail. Since this legislation will have a profound and positive impact on school districts and school children in  my district, I would like to take this opportunity  to cover the details regarding its merits.  Our schools should be safe and healthy  learning environments  for our children. H.R.  2187 gives us a chance to upgrade our school  buildings and boost student achievement while  creating good local jobs in new, clean energy  industries.  In particular, this bill provides $6.4 billion in  Federal  funds  for  school  modernization  projects that will make schools safer, more energy-efficient, and up-to-date  technologically.

638,25,2009-05-13,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," I yield myself  as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment  is  simple, straightforward and hopefully  noncontroversial. It adds a bit of accountability to this legislation by requiring  the  Institute  of Education  Sciences within  the Department  of  Education to study the impact the Federal school construction dollars have  on the institutions that are receiving  the funds.  I know proponents of this legislation  will say that school construction does  impact performance, and they may be  correct. I am skeptical of the claim. So  I am asking  for the opportunity to  study the effects of school construction  on student performance.  This amendment would require the  institute to issue a report a year after  the schools have  issued construction  funding and  report  the  impact  the  funding has. I am hopeful that such a  report could provide valuable insights  into the best use of taxpayer dollars.  I know Mr. CUELLARwanted to be  here today to speak in favor. It’s nice  to have bipartisan support for accountability.  I urge adoption of the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

Student achievement is one of the  benefits of this bill. It will also bring  health, economic, energy and environmental benefits. I believe it is clear  that students learn better when they  are in better facilities, but I certainly  have no objection to a regular study of  the issue.  I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009

In section 309, insert after subsection (b)  the following:  (c) RULE CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing  in  this section shall be construed to prohibit a  local educational agency from using sustainable,  domestic  hardwood  lumber  as  ascertained through the forest inventory and  analysis program of the Forest Service of the  Department of Agriculture under the Forest  and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641 et seq.) for  public school modernization, renovation, repairs, or construction.

644,25,2009-05-13,Mr. ELLSWORTH.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself as much time as I may  consume.  I would like to thank the bill’s sponsors, Congressman CHANDLER, Chairman MILLERand the members of the  Education and Labor Committee  for  their hard work to help provide students with modern facilities that will  help them succeed.  My amendment seeks to clarify that  nothing in the underlying bill shall be  construed  to  prohibit  a  local  educational agency  from using  sustainable, domestic hardwood  lumber  for  public school modernization, renovation, repairs or construction.  Our Nation’s hardwood lumber producers are careful stewards of a valuable resource, and their efforts make  domestic hardwood  lumber abundant  and sustainable.  These producers are  small  family  landowners  and  business,  and  their  small size has made it difficult to be  certified by green building programs.  Because of this, domestic hardwood  lumber is not currently listed as a preferred material by programs such as  LEED or Green Globes, although hardwood producers are working to correct  the situation.  H.R. 2187 wisely offers educational  agencies with some flexibility in choosing a green building certification program. And as these programs adopt  new provisions and account for new advances  in  environmentally  friendly  building, my amendment clarifies for  local education officials that domestic  hardwood lumber is not prohibited for  use in this construction.  It is my hope that green building certification programs will soon recognize  the environmental value of sustainable  use of domestic hardwood lumber.  In  the meantime,  I urge my colleagues to make sure this resource remains available to our school facilities.  Again, I’d like to thank Congressman  CHANDLER, Chairman MILLERand of all  my colleagues for their hard work on  this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

646,25,2009-05-13,Mr. MCKEON.," I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  would allow school districts to use sustainable  domestic  hardwood  for  projects approved under this program  and would require districts to report  when  they have used  renewable  resources.  Schools should be able to use the  products  that work  best  for  their  projects,  and  domestic  hardwood  should be no exception.  While I am supporting the amendment, I do not believe an additional reporting requirement is necessary. The  underlying bill already has several reporting requirements, and we’re debating an amendment for an additional  GAO report later today as well.  Each report adds costs to the district  and the government, which means that  is less money for the actual project.  I support knowing what our Federal  dollars are being used for, but I do not  think we need a mandate to report for  every step in the process.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009

The purpose of our amendment,  of course, is to actually enhance this  bill by creating more opportunities for  energy savings. Every time we save  dollars for a school, we save dollars for  our school district, we save dollars for  our taxpayers.  This bill is smart. It is to make energy efficiency investments that will  save taxpayers dollars. In addition, it  will help to educate our young people  in the positive aspects of greening. It is  extremely important to understand the  purpose of planting a tree is not only  because it looks good, but it in fact can  save on energy costs. Planting vegetables is done not only because it is a fun  thing to do, but it actually can put  food on the table that is healthy and  nutritious.  All of this is part of what we are trying to do in this bill, create energy savings for our children, for our school  districts and for our taxpayers. I encourage support of this amendment and  the underlying bill.  I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).  ",2009
651,32,2009-05-13,Mr. ANDREWS., The committee supports this bill. The bill requires the  money be spent for academic purposes.

It  is not  just about growing  food,  fruits and vegetables. This  is about  teaching them how to be responsible  and how to make sure we can get these  into  the  schools  to keep our kids  healthy and nourished, as well as business opportunities, Mr. Chairman. This  is a learning opportunity that we could  take advantage of across the country. I  strongly urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment.  ",2009

660,32,2009-05-13,Mr. SCHRADER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank  Chairman  Subcommittee  Chairman KILDEE and Representative  CHANDLER for their hard work on this  important  legislation. The 21st Century Green High-Performing Public  School Facilities Act  provides  the  country a wonderful opportunity to not  only modernize our schools by creating  a  healthier, more  environmentally  friendly learning environment for our  children, but it also creates good jobs  at a time when they are needed the  most by this country.  While there is no disputing the merits the underlying bill and the proven  benefits of green schools on students  and teachers, I believe it is crucial that  Congress has a clear picture on how  and where these funds are going to be  spent, the long-term economic savings  and the types of projects funded to be  sure we are keeping with the intent of  the legislation. That is why I am offering a straightforward good government  amendment that requires the GAO to  report to Congress on how these funds  are being utilized.  Under my amendment, the GAO will  be required to report to Congress no  later than 1 year after the enactment  on the extent and types of projects  being undertaken in the schools around  the country, the geographic distribution around the country and the urban,  suburban and rural mix. As we continue to  improve and modernize our  schools, this information is going to be  critical for the future decisionmaking  of this Congress.  I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment and the underlying legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

663,32,2009-05-13,Mr. MCKEON.," This amendment will  require  the GAO  to keep a  list of  projects that were funded through the  bill and look at who has access to these  projects. The underlying bill already  contains  lengthy  reporting  requirements that include much of this information, making this amendment largely unnecessary.  I do agree it will create jobs. There  will be people hired that will have to  fill out these reports and there will be  people hired that will have to read  these  reports. However,  if  the gentleman is interested in getting additional  information  on  the  sort  of  projects funded under this act, we have  no objection to having the GAO provide  it, other than the fact it is going to  cause government to grow even more.  I urge support of the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009

With all due respect, the amendment  does not require simply a keeping of  lists of where the money is spent. It requires an analysis of the effectiveness  of the expenditure of the money, it requires an analysis of whether all children are getting proportionately equal  access to the funds that are expended,  and it gives the Congress the basis, the  factual basis, to make further decisions  about whether to expand, eliminate or  modify such programs in the future.

666,39,2009-05-13,Mr. CONAWAY.,"  I  thank  the gentleman  from New York  for yielding  time on this issue. I rise today to lend  another bipartisan voice to support for  the Weapons Acquisition System Reform Through Enhancing Technical  Knowledge and Oversight Act, giving  rise to the best acronym yet in this  Congress—the WASTE TKO Act.  As a member of the HASC Defense  Acquisition Reform Panel, I feel a deep  sense of obligation to both our men and  women in uniform and my constituents  back home to get this right and to give  the Defense Department the tools and  the manpower it needs to get the acquisition process right.  As with almost all work on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  I  am  pleased that we are able to work in a  bipartisan manner, and I thank Chairman  Ranking  Member  MCHUGH, and Chairman ANDREWS for  their leadership throughout this process.  Last month, the GAO reported that  the ‘‘major weapons programs continue  to cost more, take longer, and deliver  fewer quantities and capabilities than  originally planned.’’ The GAO goes on  to find fault in the ‘‘planning, execution, and oversight,’’ of major weapon  programs. Congress’ inability to realistically plan for the future is slowly  strangling our ability to govern, and in  no place is that more apparent than in  how we procure military hardware.  The legislation introduced by Chairand Ranking Member  MCHUGH represents an important first  step towards our final goal of creating  an end-to-end acquisition process that  is most responsive to the needs of the  warfighter and responsible to the financial burdens of the taxpayer.  The WASTE TKO Act will ensure  that  new major weapons  programs  begin on a solid foundation; with accurate cost estimation and realistic performance goals developed before the  program progresses into the system development and demonstration phase  marked milestone B.  This legislation will institute clear  lines of accountability and authority  within the Pentagon, and establish the  policies and procedures that are necessary to create a truly knowledge-  based assessment of weapons programs.  By doing our homework upfront, our  armed services will be better able to  man SKELTON SKELTON,  and ROBANDREWS prepare for the future, our warfighters  will be better equipped, and we will be  better  stewards  of  the  limited  resources entrusted us by the taxpayers.  It is our responsibility to ensure the  warfighter  receives  the best weapon  systems  to  perform  their mission,  while at the same time ensuring that  the taxpayers get the most bang for  their buck.  The WASTE TKO Act addresses how  we procure major weapon systems and  provides much promise in resolving the  enormous cost overruns that embarrass  the government and infuriate the public.  Our bill is a step in the right direction, but we all know there is much  more to be done to refocus the acquisitions  process  on  supporting  the  warfighter first.  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to continuing to work with you and Chairman MCHUGH and  the members of the committee and Acquisition Reform Panel as we complete  this important task.  I want to thank our staff—both those  of the committee and personal offices—  who have done such great work on this  bill. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.  ",2009

669,39,2009-05-13,Mr. SKELTON.," Before I yield to the  next speaker, I wish to add to what my  colleagues on the other side have said.  What outstanding work our staff has  done on this legislation—complicated.  And they glued it together and the jigsaw puzzle has an absolute clear picture as to acquisition reform. We hope  to go from here to conference with the  Senate with a successful outline.  I yield 2 minutes to my friend and  colleague, a member of  the Armed  Services Committee,  the  gentlelady  from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEA-PORTER).  Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you, Mr.  Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of  the Weapons Acquisition  System Reform Through Enhancing  Technical Knowledge  and Oversight  Act of 2009. This legislation is an important first step in reforming the defense acquisitions process.  We know  that due  to  insufficient  oversight, acquisition programs have  continued to skyrocket in costs. The  cost growth of weapons systems acquisition has been a huge drain on taxpayer dollars—with minimal growth estimates of at least $166 billion. A 20  percent improvement in these numbers  could save the taxpayers up to $30 billion.  This legislation ensures accuracy in  performance  assessments  by  designating an official to conduct performance assessments. In addition, it establishes additional annual reviews from  oversight officials  for problem  contracts. These reviews, coupled with additional congressional oversight of the  ailing programs, will help keep programs on track.  Finally,  this  legislation  creates a  better system to track cost growth  during early contract development. By  the time system development begins, 75  percent of the costs are already  in  place. By regulating cost growth in the  early development, we will have true  cost estimates and we can seek alternative solutions if it’s necessary.  This legislation puts in place essential internal controls to the defense acquisition process. I will continue to advocate  for  fiscally  responsible  programs that provide optimal equipment  for our Nation’s military.  I thank the chairman and all those  who worked on this bill.  ",2009
670,39,2009-05-13,Mr. MCHUGH.," At this time I’d be  happy to yield such time as he may  consume to our ranking member on the  Air and Land Subcommittee, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT).  ",2009
671,39,2009-05-13,Mr. BARTLETT.," I strongly encourage my colleagues to pass H.R. 2101, a  much needed acquisition reform bill.  This bill will help facilitate a strong  national defense, while reining in out-  of-control cost growth in the development of major weapons systems.  This bill is a result of an intensive,  cooperative, and collaborative bipartisan and bicameral effort to improve  and modernize the procurement and acquisition process for our Armed Forces.  I want to recognize in particular the  efforts  of  Chairman  Ranking Member JOHNMCHUGH, and  the members of the Defense Acquisition Reform Panel  led by Chairman  ROBERTANDREWSand Ranking Member  SKELTON,  IKE MIKECONAWAY.  Additionally, I would like to thank  the unusually talented staff for their  tireless work and contributions to this  legislation.  H.R. 2101 is a much needed response  to help minimize cost overruns and increase oversight and transparency in  the way the Defense Department buys  big-ticket weapons programs. I’m confident this legislation will provide a  positive step forward for our military  that will save taxpayers billions of dollars.  Moreover, this piece of  legislation  strategically addresses many of  the  issues I have long raised as concerns,  including requirements creep, delivery  delays,  overly  optimistic  cost  estimates, and the need for an independent  broker to advise the military and Congress.  Two weeks ago during our HASC full  committee hearing on Reform of Major  Weapons Systems Acquisition, I posed  a question before our distinguished  panel of experienced acquisition experts regarding how they would weigh  the causes of program cost overruns.  I asked them to record percentages  based on what I called requirements  creep,  intentional underbidding, and,  three, optimistic or incompetent cost  estimating.  In short, what I took away from our  expert panelists’ answers was that fixing a broken defense acquisition system heavily lies with the requirements  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:40 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13MY7.099 H13MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 7 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2009

673,46,2009-05-13,Mr. CARNEY.," I thank the gentleman.  I rise, obviously, in support of this  bill. I do want to thank my good friend  and shipmate, MARKKIRK, for working  so hard across the aisle to get this  done. It is always very heartening in  this body when we can do the right  thing, and this truly is the right thing  to do. It’s a commonsense approach  that actually recognizes the members  of the Armed Forces who have earned a  Medal of Honor and provides a chance  for the Medal of Honor Foundation to  fill its coffers and continue to do the  good work that it always intended to  do.  The Medal of Honor was first authorized by Congress in 1861 as the United  States Navy’s highest personal decoration. At that time, the Army and Air  Force also created Medals of Honor to  award their members.  There have been a total of 3,447 recipients of the Medal of Honor. And as  my good friend, Mr. KIRK, said, only 97  are living today.  I am proud to represent a district in  Pennsylvania. And  I will have you  know that Pennsylvania is second only  to New York State in Medal of Honor  recipients.  It is my hope that these coins issued  under this act will serve as a reminder  of the importance of this medal and of  the acts these brave men and women  performed.  The  surplus of  funds  raised  from  these coins will benefit the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, a  not-for-profit  organization  chartered  by the 85th Congress under legislation  signed into law by Dwight Eisenhower  on August 14, 1958.  The Congressional Medal of Honor  Foundation  is  dedicated  to  perpetuating the Medal of Honor’s  legacy  through outreach and collaborative efforts. It also raises funds for initiatives  that promote the values that the Medal  of Honor represents, which is courage,  sacrifice, and patriotism.  Some of the examples of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation activities include working with the staff  of the Smithsonian National Museum  of American History  to establish a  dedicated Medal of Honor exhibit as  part of the larger permanent exhibit  called ‘‘The Price of Freedom.’’ They  also  established  a Medal  of Honor  scholarship program  for outstanding  students enrolled in the Reserve Officer  Training Corps programs for the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marines. Collaborating in the production  of two Medal of Honor documentaries  released in 2006; one,  ‘‘The Medal of  Honor,’’ produced by PBS, and two,  ‘‘The Medal,’’ syndicated for television  across the United States. Established  an Above & Beyond Citizen Honors program to recognize ordinary Americans  who have exhibited in their daily lives  the  same  ideals  that  the Medal of  Honor recipients displayed in combat.  The President of  the United States  joined the Medal of Honor recipients in  the laying of a wreath at the Tomb of  the Unknowns this year to initiate the  Above & Beyond Citizen Honor ceremonies.  Finally, the  foundation distributed  more than 53,000 copies of the book  ‘‘Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor  Beyond the Call of Duty’’ to public and  private school students in every State.  These efforts deserve our  support,  and so do the men and women who  have been awarded the Medal of Honor.  I urge my fellow Members to support  this bill to help ensure that the legacy  of the men and women whose brave  acts earned them the Medal of Honor  will be remembered.  ",2009

I want to thank them for introducing this bill to provide funding  to the foundation that is doing, obviously, a great deal of wonderful work  in our Nation to honor men and women  who have served in the military and  those out in the public who have not  served in the military.

680,46,2009-05-13,Mr. WATT.," Madam Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 347) to grant the Congressional  Gold Medal, collectively, to the 100th  Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, United States  Army, in recognition of their dedicated  service during World War II.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 347  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. FINDINGS.  Congress makes the following findings:  (1) On January 19, 1942, 6 weeks after the  December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor by  the Japanese Navy, the United States Army  discharged all Japanese-Americans  in the  Reserve Officers Training Corps and changed  their draft status to  ‘‘4C’’—the status of  ‘‘enemy alien’’ which is ineligible for the  draft.  (2) On January 23, 1942, Japanese-Americans in the military on the mainland were  segregated out of their units.  (3) Further, on May 3, 1942, General John  L. DeWitt issued Civilian Exclusion Order  No. 346, ordering all people of Japanese ancestry, whether citizens or noncitizens, to  report  to  assembly  centers, where  they  would live until being moved to permanent  relocation centers.  (4) On June 5, 1942, 1,432 predominantly  Nisei (second generation Americans of Japanese ancestry) members of the Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion were shipped from  the Hawaiian Islands to Oakland, CA, where  the 100th Infantry Battalion was activated  on June 12, 1942, and then shipped to train at  Camp McCoy, Wisconsin.  (5) The excellent training record of the  100th Infantry Battalion and petitions from  prominent civilian and military personnel  helped convince President Roosevelt and the  War Department to re-open military service  to Nisei volunteers who were incorporated  into the 442nd Regimental Combat Team  after it was activated in February of 1943.  (6) In that same month, the 100th Infantry  Battalion was transferred to Camp Shelby,  Mississippi, where it continued to train and  even though the battalion was ready to deploy shortly thereafter, the battalion was refused by General Eisenhower, due to concerns over the loyalty and patriotism of the  Nisei.  (7) The 442nd Regimental Combat Team  later trained with the 100th Infantry Battalion at Camp Shelby in May of 1943.  (8) Eventually,  the  100th  Infantry Battalion was deployed to the Mediterranean  and entered combat in Italy on September  26, 1943.  (9) Due to their bravery and valor, members of the Battalion were honored with 6  awards of the Distinguished Service Cross in  the first 8 weeks of combat.

685,67,2009-05-13,Mr. AKIN.," Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to join you this evening here in the  Chamber and talk for a while about  what I think a very interesting subject  to many, many Americans. If they’re  not interested in it now, they will be  rapidly as this issue develops here in  Washington, D.C.  What we’re talking about is, most  specifically, the background on a thing  that’s called cap-and-trade or cap-and-  tax. And ‘‘cap-and-tax’’ is probably a  better name for it because what we’re  talking about is a very, very large tax  increase that is to be justified because  of the great danger, the imminent peril  that is created by global warming—although that has now been called sometimes  ‘‘climate  change,’’  or  global  warming, or other various names. And  soon the Legislature is going to actually be doing the debating and the voting on this very, very large tax increase.  Now, the President promised people  that there would be no one making  $250,000 or less who is going to get any  tax increases. But, unfortunately, this  tax increase hits all Americans; even  the average household will be paying  thousands of dollars more.  The President promised that nobody  making $250,000 or less was going to get  any tax increases. Well, we have seen  that is not true, and particularly with  this cap-and-tax situation, the tax on  all kinds of people in the country. In  fact,  every  time you  turn  a  light  switch on, you would be paying a tax.  So I don’t think we can take the President seriously on that promise.  Now, the justification for this very  large tax increase is the popular subject of global warming, or  climate  change, or whatever. And that is the  general idea that mankind is making  CO2—that’s  the  product  of  burning  something. When you burn something,  the oxygen in the atmosphere combines  with the fuel and it makes CO2. It’s the  bubbles in soda pop. So we drink CO2,  as a matter of fact. And in a sense, the  soda pop manufacturer is sequestering  the CO2 in bottles of soda pop and you  are letting it loose when you open the  can. Anyway, the theory is that CO2 is  the culprit, and therefore we have to  reduce the amount of CO2. And so this  tax is being justified to reduce CO2so  the planet won’t burn up. That’s the  fast version of it.  So what I thought I would do this  evening is to give just a little bit of a  historic perspective because sometimes  when you go into one of these debates,  it’s interesting to take a look and see,  you know, are we the first people that  have ever been talking about this, or is  there a historic perspective of some  kind on it? And I found that the historic  perspective here  is  somewhat  amusing and kind of  interesting. So  I’m going to take you back to the year  1920. At that time, in 1920, the newspapers were filled with scientific warnings of a fast-approaching glacial age.  So in 1920, the scientists were saying  that the planet was going to get really  cold, there was going to be glaciers  running around all over, so we need to  be prepared for very wintry weather because there are glaciers that are going  to blow around. So that is 1920.  1930s; the predominant scientists at  the time reversed themselves to the  fact that in the near future there is  going to be what they called ‘‘serious  global warming.’’ So from the twenties  to the thirties, the scientists changed.  In 1972, Time magazine cited numerous  scientific reports of  imminent  ‘‘run-  away glacial activities.’’ So now we’ve  gone from global warming to glacial  activities again in 1972.  In  1975, Newsweek  says, Scientific  evidence of a great ice age, and we were  being called to stockpile  food, that  maybe what we should be considering  doing was melting the ice packs, the  icecaps at the North and South Poles  to try to stop this tremendous ice age  that was coming in 1972 and 1975. But  in 1976, the U.S. Government says the  Earth is headed into some sort of mini-  ice age.  b1830  So this was continued through the  seventies, and now we’ve gone back to  global warming.  So over a period of the last hundred  years or so, the major scientists—at  least the ones that were talking out on  this subject—have reversed themselves  three times. I think it gives us some  cause to be a little cautious before we  jump into a massive tax increase to  deal with a problem that has been coming around for the last 100 years, either  getting too hot or too cold.  Now  there were  statements made  today that say that there is complete  agreement that we have global warming and all of the major scientists all  agree and the time for debate is over.  Particularly,  I’m  quoting,  in  1992,  going back to ’92, Al Gore made this  statement, quote, Only an insignificant  fraction of scientists deny the global  warming crisis. The time for debate is  over.  Let’s do this quote again. 1992, Al  Gore says, ‘‘Only an insignificant fraction  of  scientists  deny  the  global  warming crisis. The time for debate is  over.’’ Yet in that same year a Gallup  poll said that 53 percent of scientists  involved—these are the scientists that  are involved in the climate change debates and questions—only 53 percent of  them didn’t agree that there was going  to  be  global warming,  30  percent  weren’t sure, and only 17 percent believed that global warming had begun  in the year 1992.  Moving closer to our own time period, just last year you have in The  Wall Street Journal a report by an MIT  professor, Richard Lindzen, says—this  is his quote, There is no consensus on  global warming.  Now when he made that statement,  boy, did he get beat up. All the media  and all kinds of people were all over  him saying, that was a reckless thing  to say that there’s no consensus on the  subject, which  led  him,  after  he’d  taken a tremendous amount of political flak, to say that it seems that  global warming is more of a political  issue than it is a scientific or technical  one. And that was the professor from  MIT’s opinion in that regard.  So that’s just to try to give us a little bit of an introduction to obviously  what is a controversial question. Even  if global warming were widely believed  to be true by scientists, then there are  a whole series of other questions that  have to be asked. Can we do anything  about it? Should we pass a huge and  massive  tax  increase?  Is  that necessary? So that’s what we’re going to  talk about.  We’re joined, as usual, by some really  capable people that have taken some  time to look into this issue, and I am  absolutely delighted to introduce one  of those to you now, and that is Congressman LATTAfrom Ohio.  ",2009
686,67,2009-05-13,Mr. LATTA.," Congressman, thank you  very much for hosting this extremely  important Special Order  tonight on  cap-and-tax. It’s an issue that I think  every American had better learn about  quickly.  I did a teletown hall last night, and  we discussed it quite a bit because in  my area we’re hurting.

687,74,2009-05-13,Mr. LATTA.," I thank the gentleman. I  will be brief. Time is short for this  country. We have folks out there that  need jobs—and they need them today.  We have been in a tough recession.  Back in 1982, when we were coming  out of that recession folks were confident that those factories were going  to open back up;  that  those doors  would be open and those jobs would be  there. Today, a lot of those jobs are  gone. We’re in a tough economic environment. We’re in a tough global environment—the competition is tough.  If we want to make sure that we can  compete in this country and we can  make sure that we have those jobs in  this country to compete against the  rest of the world, we have to make sure  that we have the costs down. If we go  through this cap-and-tax, it’s going to  be a bad day for America.  I just want to thank the gentleman  for hosting this tonight. We’re going to  be talking about this not only here in  Congress, but across our districts in  the coming days.  ",2009
688,74,2009-05-13,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time, I am  just so delighted with our guests here  on the floor. You know, the common  sense in me can’t resist showing this  little chart. How much does a human  activity affect greenhouse gases? Well,  if  this  block  represents  greenhouse  gases right here, then CO2 is those yellow boxes. That’s the amount of greenhouse gas that’s heating the world by  CO2. The rest of this is other things  that are heating the world. Then, this  is the amount that’s caused by people.  So this seems to be an awful big tax for  such a little tiny box.  I want to once again thank my good  friends,  Congresswoman  from  Minnesota  and  Congressman  from Ohio and Congressman  BISHOPfrom Utah for joining us. I hope  that this has been as informative and  interesting for everybody else as much  as it was for me.  BACHMANN  LATTA f  FORECLOSURE CRISIS  ",2009
689,74,2009-05-13,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2009, the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. MILLER) is recognized for  60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Tonight, I would like to devote this hour  to the foreclosure crisis that the Nation faces—and will continue to face  for some time; the financial crisis; the  recession that we now have that is the  worst recession since the Great Depression, precipitated by the  foreclosure  crisis and by the  financial crisis.  I  want to talk about how we got where  we are and what we need to do now to  make sure it never happens again.  According to the financial industry,  what happened was this freakish combination of macroeconomic forces that  no one could have predicted. It was a  perfect storm. But with a little help  from the government,  from the taxpayers, and a little bit of patience, we  will muddle through this and we will be  back to where we were just a couple of  years ago; not to worry.  Columnist Paul Krugman earlier this  week quoted a prominent Wall Street  lawyer who was under consideration to  be  the Deputy Treasury Secretary,  Rodgin Cohen, as saying that the Wall  Street that will emerge from this will  not be terribly different from the Wall  Street of the recent past, and said, ‘‘I  am far from convinced that there was  something inherently wrong with the  system.’’  Mr. Speaker, a Wall Street or a financial system that  is not different  from the one in the recent past that  just gets us back to where we were a  couple of years ago is not much of a  deal for the American middle class. I  don’t claim that I knew that the financial crisis would happen the way it did.  But I knew that the mortgages that  have proven so toxic for the financial  system and for the financial industry  were toxic for borrowers, were toxic for  homeowners. And I thought that was  reason enough to do something about  it.  I began working on the issue almost  as soon as I was elected or entered Congress in 2003. In 2004, I introduced legislation, along with Congressman WATT,  to prohibit many of the practices that  led us to where we are now. And we  saw—I know well what kinds of mortgages have led us to the foreclosure crisis.  Subprime mortgages went from 8 percent of all mortgages in 2003 to 28 percent in the heyday of subprime lending—the 2004 to 2006 period. More than  half of the people who got subprime  loans qualified for prime loans. Many  others should never have gotten any  loan of any kind.  There  were  extravagant  upfront  charges, costs, and fees. Ninety percent  of loans had an adjustable rate, with a  quick adjustment after  just  2 or  3  years. The  typical  adjustment—the  teaser rate, the initial rate was frequently above prime. It was no deal in  the first place.  Then, when the adjustment set in, regardless of what interest rates were,  the monthly payments would go up by  30 to 50 percent. Seventy percent of the  loans had a prepayment penalty that  made  it almost  impossible  for borrowers to get out without losing a big  chunk of the equity in their home.  The  loans  were  designed  to  be  unsustainable. They had the effect of  trapping borrowers in a cycle of repeated refinancing. Every time they refinanced, having to pay points and fees  and closing costs to get into the new  loan and a prepayment penalty to get  out of the last loan.  All that time, the industry defended  all those terms, all those practices as  necessary to provide credit to homeowners who would  not  qualify  for  prime  loans. The  terms,  they  said,  might appear predatory to the uninformed, Members of Congress like me,  the consumer groups, but they were  really  innovations that would make  credit available to people who otherwise could not have gotten it.  Repeatedly they said this legislation,  while well-intended, will just hurt the  very people it’s trying to help. I admit  that I resented being patronized at the  time. But now, looking at what really  happened, I am furious at the dishonesty of it all.  b1930  Mr. Speaker, this is what really happened. This is a chart of the percentage  of corporate profits in America that  the financial services industry got. And  it peaked during the period, the heyday  of subprime lending, at more than 40  percent of all corporate profits. The  terms of mortgages that appeared predatory really were predatory. The lenders did not have to include those terms  in their loans.  Now,  obviously,  something  went  wrong. And I want to talk about that  in a bit. But I first want to recognize  my colleague. This is the majority party’s hour. But in the spirit of bipartisanship,  or  post-partisanship,  I  am  happy to recognize MIKETURNER, my  colleague from Ohio. Mr. TURNERhas  many fine qualities. His political party  is not one of them. But he represents a  district, Dayton, Ohio, that has been  particularly hard-hit by the foreclosure  crisis.  And I want to recognize Mr. TURNER  to talk about what he has seen happen  in Dayton.  ",2009
690,74,2009-05-13,Mr. TURNER.," Well, I want to thank  BRADMILLER for his leadership on this  issue. This is a very important issue  that affects our whole country. And we  all took a pause as we saw our financial  institutions  shaken  nationally.  And as the bailouts were proposed that  came here to this floor to be voted  upon, across the country, Americans  wondered, How did we get here? How  did this happen?  Now I voted against every bailout  that came here to this floor. And I  voted against it because not only did I  believe that they were not structured  appropriately, that there was money  that was going to be wasted, but more  importantly, not one of them included  a change in the laws that would prohibit the type of practices that got us  here to begin with. The toxic assets  that people talk about are these mortgage-backed securities that were traded and sold upstream. They were the  securities that were based upon practices of mortgage lending that had a  negative impact on our families and a  negative impact on our communities.  And today I wanted to offer my support for the recently passed bill, H.R.  1728, Mr. MILLER’s bill, the Mortgage  Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending  Act of 2009. This bill directly addresses  the root causes of the current financial  and  economic  crisis  in  the United  States as well as how it has led to some  home  abandonment  and  high  foreclosure rates throughout the country.

691,88,2009-05-13,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman  from New Hampshire  (Mr.  HODES) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2009
692,88,2009-05-13,Mr. HODES.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague, Mr. TONKO, and I join him in  voicing my  support  for  President  Obama’s plan to limit dangerous carbon emissions, put us on a path to energy security, and create millions of  American clean energy jobs. Right now  Americans realize that our American  energy policy is not working. The last  administration gave billions of dollars  in tax subsidies to oil companies despite the fact that they were earning  record profits, and despite their willingness to gouge the American people.  We clearly need a new energy policy  that invests in renewable energy that  will be cheaper for American families  and will be homegrown, American energy that will create jobs and lead the  world in a 21st century energy economy.  Right now we are facing the most severe economic crisis in a generation,  the most severe economic crisis since  the Great Depression; and at the same  time, our scientists are clearly telling  us that our inaction is threatening the  planet.  Fortunately, by Congress taking one  single action and passing what will  come to the floor as climate legislation, we will take a giant leap towards  mending both of our problems. The  President has  laid out an ambitious  agenda, recognizing that as Americans  we can do great things when we come  together and work together  for the  common good. The President has presented us with a clean energy jobs plan  that will:  create new,  21st  century  American jobs throughout the product-  supply chain; protect existing jobs; reduce our dependence on  foreign oil;  save money on energy costs for American taxpayers in the long run; reduce  carbon pollution, and, with it, combat  the  dangerous  effects  of  climate  change.  By forcing those who have long polluted our air and water for free to finally pay for their carbon pollution, we  will begin to shift away from our dependence on dirty, outdated, obsolete  energy technology.  Instead, we will provide  incentives  for American business. We are going to  unleash the American entrepreneurial  spirit and create clean energy jobs. We  will lead the world in technology and  manufacturing that will drive a new,  much more prosperous energy economy.  Think of the cost savings. This plan  to shift American energy production to  domestic alternative sources like solar  and wind and biomass, which means  wood in New Hampshire where I come  from, will be cheaper and cleaner and  will save Americans billions of dollars  in the long run.  By forcing our Nation to tackle climate change and develop new energy,  the plan will create millions of new  jobs and whole new industries here in  the United States, employing everyone  from construction workers to secretaries to salespeople to engineers. It  will open new markets  for us. Just  imagine what it is like if we can become the world leaders in renewable  and alternative energy. Think of the  products  and  services we  can  sell  around the globe and the goodwill we  will get.  Inaction  is no  longer  an  option.  Doing nothing about climate change  will cost exponentially more than the  President’s plan. One respected study  on this says that inaction could end up  costing between 5 and 20 percent of the  total world GDP. We must act.  Now, my friends on the other side of  the aisle are either scared of change,  pessimistic about the American entrepreneurial spirit, or are denying the  scientific consensus because they rely  on campaign funds from oil and coal interests. The truth remains, we must  act.  President Obama’s plan provides the  support and incentives needed to help  the American can-do spirit of innovation and creativity to build the new  clean technologies of the future.  Just as we led the world in developing  the automobile and  the computer, we will once again  lead  the  world  in  developing  new,  cheaper,  cleaner technologies to lead the world  for the 21st century. In addition, we  will provide  lower-income Americans  with a clean energy tax credit to assist  them in this transition to a prosperous  new clean energy economy.  I have proposed we have a commission to make sure that Congress knows  the  impact on small businesses and  low- and moderate-income folks of the  climate change legislation that we are  going to pass.  We are already  feeling the effects  around this country of a changing climate. We ignored the warnings of the  experts of the risks for far too long. We  have learned the dangers, and the costs  are mounting to clean up the mess  after the crisis has hit. We need to act  as good stewards of the Earth. The  American people are trusting us to act  to protect our children and our grandchildren and to be stewards of the public trust. We need to remember that  there will be tremendous unsustainable  economic costs of dealing with the impacts of climate change once they have  occurred  because  Mother  Nature  doesn’t do bailouts.  So let me conclude by rejecting the  charge of those who would defend the  polluters and put our kids at risk.  They  are  simply wrong. President  Obama’s clean energy plan is the opposite of a tax increase. It is regulating  polluters to protect our country, protect our environment, create jobs, invest  in American business, and save  American families money via a direct  tax credit and increased energy efficiency.

693,102,2009-05-13,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," As I indicated in  my initial comments, I am not trying  to be an obstructionist. In response to  DOI’s complaints, I have offered to sit  down with them, in good faith, and go  through the questions one by one. The  standard I would use would be if any  Member of this body were to be Secretary of Interior, which of the questions would they have  insisted that  their staff extensively analyze prior to  taking the actions the Department has  taken? I do believe my questions will  be answered, but it is clear that in the  short term, these questions are being  answered because of this cloture motion. That troubles me because I believe the Senate, in its role to advise  and consent on Presidential nominees,  is entitled to answers from the administration about what its policy is as we  move forward.  It should not matter whether these  questions come  from Republicans or  Democrats. It is reasonable to expect  that any one of us in this body can get  honest answers about how this administration is going to pursue and implement an energy policy.  I hoped we would have an opportunity to sit down and go over the  questions, but, instead, this morning  we are going to see a vote on the floor.  My hold on David Hayes didn’t come  attached with demands to change a  rule, make a rule, or approve a plan or  policy. I just want some answers as to  what the administration’s policies are  going to be. My commitment is to get  those answers.  Regardless of what happens with this  vote today, I am certainly going to  pursue actively the development of all  forms of energy in this country because  we are going to need all of them in  high volumes.  I do  look  forward to  working in good faith with the Interior  Department, whatever its makeup, because we have a lot of work to do. We  know that. We need to commit to that  level of activity.  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

We know for a  fact that he is superbly qualified because the Senate has already confirmed  him for that exact office once before.  That was 9 years ago. He served in that  office with great distinction during the  Clinton administration.  Mr. Hayes also served as counselor to  Secretary Babbitt for several years before being appointed Deputy Secretary.

698,109,2009-05-13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Oregon is recognized.  ,2009
699,109,2009-05-13,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, I commend my chairman, the distinguished  Senator from Connecticut, for his work  on the legislation before us today. This  has been a complex issue. The chairman has worked very hard to bring  people together on all sides. I commend  also the senior Senator from Alabama  for his vital engagement on these reforms that touch the wallet or the  pocketbook of virtually every American. America needs credit card reform.  Take the case of Maggie Bagon, a 59-  year-old social worker from Salem, OR.  As reported in the Oregonian, Maggie  used her card conservatively. She paid  her bills on time. So she was incensed  when her credit card company charged  her a late fee.  So she called up the bank. They told  her  the  terms of her contract permitted them to sit on her payment for  10 days before they posted it to her account, and that made  it  feasible—in  fact, lawful—for them to charge her a  late fee when she paid her bill early.  That  type of practice  is a  scam.  Maggie and thousands of Oregonians,  perhaps millions of Americans, have  been charged late fees for paying their  credit cards early. That kind of deception and trickery has to end.  Late fees for early payments is not  the only type of scam we have had in  this  industry. How  about  interest  charges on balances that have been  paid off? Well, you have paid it off, and  you are very happy about that. You are  now free of interest? No, you are not—  not under the rules of the fine print in  many credit card agreements.  How about fees for going over the  limit when you do not know you are  over the limit? Well, it used to be you  were simply turned down and that was  fine because that was the deal you had  and you understood the deal. But now  suddenly you  get your  credit  card  statement, and you find out you were  charged a $30 fee when you bought a  newspaper with a credit card or you  were charged a $30 fee when you bought  a $5 meal with your credit card because  the bank was not going to tell you  about the fee because they wanted to  collect those fees for going over the  limit.  Well, this act will fix that problem,  that type of scam on the American  worker. In fact, credit card companies  have even charged fees for making your  payments at all. Some charge fees for  paying with a check. Some charge fees  for paying over  the  Internet. Some  charge fees for paying by telephone.  That is simply crazy, and this act will  address these types of tricks and traps  that have become key and central to  the industry.  As a member of the Oregon House of  Representatives  and  as  speaker,  I  worked with my colleagues to reform  lending practices in our home State.  We tried to address credit card practices to establish fair rules of the road,  and our  legal counsel said: No, you  can’t do that here at the State level.  You have to do that at the Federal  level. It is federally preempted. So we  were not able to help people such as  Maggie, the citizens of our State, have  fair practices. Only the Federal Government, under Federal law, can make  these changes.  But if we all have reserved to ourselves the power to set fair practices,  then we have a moral obligation to set  those fair practices. We have an obligation on behalf of the millions of American citizens such as Maggie. That is  why this legislation is so important.  It is strong, commonsense legislation  which targets the most abusive practices. In particular, I am proud it prohibits ‘‘universal default’’ on existing  balances—that bait-and-switch  tactic  when, under the deal you have signed  up for, you are charged 7 percent, but  after you make those charges, your interest rate is suddenly switched to 29  percent.  I am proud this bill requires that  payments beyond the minimum monthly payment be applied to the balances  with the highest rate of interest.  I am proud this bill limits the aggressive solicitation of young persons; that  it prohibits fees based on the method of  payment, be it telephone, mail, Internet or otherwise; that it prohibits over-  the-limit fees unless a person opts in to  that  feature—it  is a  fair deal, you  choose it—and that it prohibits late  fees if the card issuer delayed posting  the payment.  These long-overdue, commonsense reforms are  important  steps  to bring  transparency and  fairness  to  credit  card contracts. These reforms will help  Maggie and millions such as her from  Connecticut to Oregon and everywhere  in between.  Friends, this legislation is also good  for our banking system. There is one  clear lesson we have learned this year;  that is, fair lending results in families  who are on a solid foundation, strong  consumers, and it avoids the sort of  securitization that results  in poison  pills being based on fraudulent, deceptive practices, poison pills that infect  our banks and  financial  institutions  around the world.  Even the banks are aware this system is flawed, and some have tried to  offer  better,  safer  cards. But  they  found  it hard to differentiate themselves. Why is that? Well, here is why.  It is pretty straightforward. Consumers  do not have the time or patience to  read the dozens of pages of fine print  that come in a credit card contract and  then to compare its terms—and be able  to evaluate its terms—to the dozens of  pages that come with another credit  card.  But even if a person dedicated a week  of their life to comparing two credit  card contracts, it would not matter because, at the end of the contract, it  says: These terms can be changed at  the discretion of the credit card company  at  any  time. And  they  are  changed frequently. Therefore, the contract does not give you the ability to  compare and contrast. Therefore, we  have a dysfunctional market because  consumers are not able to choose better cards with better practices.  We need to create a functional market where there is competition—competition not based on how many tricks  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:14 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13MY6.014 S13MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009
700,116,2009-05-13,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President, briefly,  have  high  regard  for  Senator  and  the  intent  of  the  amendment.  I  also  understand  the  practical application of what  could  happen. I know in my home State of  Georgia,  in  one  school  system  in  Gwinnett County, there are 178 different languages spoken. The application of this amendment would cause,  for example, in Gwinnett County, 178  different credit reports in 178 different  languages to meet the intent of the  law.  I  respect and understand  the difficulty that fluency can make in someone’s ability to read and do their financial affairs. However, before we were to  require of all the credit reporting agencies that they publish all credit reports  and make them available in every language  that could be  spoken  in  the  United States, we should conduct a  study through GAO to ensure that we  understand  the  relationship between  fluency and  financial affairs on the  part of an  individual and we understand exactly what the consequences of  this amendment would be. This gives  us 1 year to study and make a final decision based on facts rather than forcing an automatic imposition of credit  reports being published in a variety of  different  languages, which  could be  well in excess of 100.  I, respectfully, appreciate the consideration of the Senate.  I yield back the remainder of my  time and  suggest  the absence of a  quorum.  ",2009

708,116,2009-05-13,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, as you  may have observed  in our time together in the Senate, I do not come to  the floor of the Senate to speak very  often. I try to reserve my comments  for matters of particular importance  and urgency, matters where I think we  can make a real difference and where  The  the debate will matter. We are debating one  such  issue  today, when  it  comes to the important need, the critical need to rein in the abusive practices of credit card companies that are  harming  thousands  of middle-class  families across my State and millions  of middle-class families across America.  Just  this  last weekend  I  received  more than 500 letters and e-mails from  my constituents, middle-class people  across Indiana who are outraged because they rightly believe they have  been abused by the predatory practices  of credit card companies. These are decent  hard-working  people who  ask  nothing more than for a fair shake in  life and, too often, they are not getting  it because of the these abusive practices.  I wish to take the opportunity to  share with you a couple of these stories. Many of them are heartfelt. I will  give an example. This one is from a single mother. She writes me:  Dear Senator BAYH, I am a single mother  of a teenage boy, and I work 50 hours per  week—  She is not some deadbeat, she is a  hard-working, middle American—  at a job I’ve had for 14 years. My ex-husband  quit his job out of the blue a couple of years  ago and did not pay any child support for  over a year.  Unfortunately, I had to turn to using my  credit cards for things like groceries, gas and  other bills just to keep up. If you are even 1  or 2 days late in paying your bill, these credit card companies increase your percentage  rate to astronomically high amounts. Because I was struggling and a few days—not  months, just a few days—late on some of my  credit card payments, the percentage rates  on my credit cards are now between 28 and 32  percent. I will never pay off these bills with  interest rates like this!  So many people out there, including myself, are at the mercy of these unscrupulous  credit card companies that can do whatever  they please. There needs to be laws regulating  how much  these  companies  can  charge. Americans are mired in credit cards  debt that will never be paid off, no matter  how hard they work and no matter how hard  they try  if the current practices do not  change.  My economic situation will be so much  better if it were not for my credit card bills.  I owe probably $15,000 now on all of my credit  card bills combined, but it will take me a  lifetime to pay those off because of the practices to which I have been subjected. Please  fight  for hard working people everywhere  who  just want a chance to get out  from  under their debt and better their financial  circumstances.  I also heard from a woman in Carmel,  IN, just north of Indianapolis, a few  weeks ago. She had an $8,000 balance on  a closed—a closed credit card account.  She was not buying anything. She had  always paid her bill on time. And out  of the blue one day—she had done nothing wrong—her credit card company  doubled her minimum payment. She is  a woman of modest means and she  could not make the higher payment.  She called the bank and they would not  work with her, even though she had  never missed a payment or been late,  not once.  Soon the credit company started adding late fees and compounding her interest. Over the course of 2 years, her  balance tripled from $8,000 to $24,000,  without making a single purchase. She  had bought nothing. She had done  nothing wrong. And  she  is getting  gouged like this. This is the kind of  thing that has to stop.  I heard  from  another  constituent  from Middlebury,  IN, another basic  middle-class middle American, who received an offer from her credit card  company to consolidate her balance on  all of her credit cards at 4 percent.  Well, that sounded like a pretty good  rate, so she accepted the offer. She  never missed a payment. She had paid  off half her debt, when suddenly they  raised the monthly minimum payment  by 60 percent. So she is paying on time,  she is paying down her debt, and her  monthly minimum rate goes up by 60  percent without cause or any notice.  She called customer service to complain. They said they would lower her  monthly minimum  payment  if  she  would agree to have her interest rate  doubled. This woman from Middlebury  is a mother. She is trying to keep her  head above water, and her credit card  company is making life more difficult  with practices like that.  Those are the kinds of things we have  to stop. And those are the kinds of  things I hope we will stop yet this  week here in the Senate.  Here is what she wrote:  I don’t know that our government can do a  thing about this, but I just wanted to be  heard.  Well, here  is the place where her  voice can be heard. Here is the place  where thousands of middle-class families like hers can come for some relief.  Here is the place where over 500 people  who wrote about the abuses to which  they have been subjected can come for  some relief.  This recession has caused millions of  middle-class families to resort to using  their credit cards a little bit more, not  because they wanted to but because  they had to try to make ends meet.  They are working hard, trying to get  out from under this situation, and it  does not make  life any easier when  they are  running uphill because of  these abusive practices.  You know, bills are sent out so late.  They arrive in our mailbox and you  have got 24 or 48 hours to pay the thing  off or you are subjected to a late fee.  That  is not  right. Then  they  start  charging interest on the late fee. Interest rates can literally, because of the  fine print  in these bills—you know,  back in the day, you applied for a credit card, it was about a one-page thing.  Now it is 20 or 30 pages of fine print.  And buried in there in the fine print  are the provisions where companies can  raise your interest rates any amount,  anytime, for any reason, or for no reason whatsoever. Those are the kinds of  things that need to be stopped.  Then, finally, when you are making  your payments, they take the payment  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:14 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A13MY6.004 S13MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009

710,123,2009-05-13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, there are  very  few Members  for whom I have  more affection or respect than JUDD  GREGGof New Hampshire. But I think  this amendment, first of all, has no  place on this bill. It is unnecessary and  raises some very serious,  legitimate  issues. Let me point them out.  First of all, it is going to be costly to  do this: every agency to report what  the national debt is. The number is absolutely worthless by  the  time you  publish  it because the national debt  rises, of course, every nanosecond. So  to have that idea what it is also gives  you a false illusion of actually where  we are.  The level of public cynicism about  this  issue  is  getting  almost  insurmountable. It seems to me we need to  be far more realistic. There are other  costs, as well, in addition to the debt  that people care about. Why not have a  tuition cost clock? Why not have a  health care cost clock? These matters  go up all the time as well. It seems to  me that by adding something such as  this, we are just adding to that illusion, adding to that cynicism at a time  when there are plenty of places where  you  can  get  this  information—certainly the Congressional Budget Office  as well.  So while this amendment has been  adopted in the past because it seems  relatively harmless, the fact is, I think  it is an idea that can actually raise  costs and create false illusions. Certainly consumers ought to have some  idea about some of these other costs,  which I would object to. If you had a  health care cost clock, a tuition cost  clock, an energy cost clock, it could  contribute to those problems. So I urge  that the amendment be defeated.  ",2009
711,123,2009-05-13,Mr.  SANDERS.," Mr.  President,  I  make a point of order that the pending  amendment violates section 302(f) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  ",2009

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.  ",2009
717,123,2009-05-13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  let me  make a couple of comments, if I can,  regarding previous debates.  Our colleague from Vermont offered  an amendment to deal with caps on interest rates and that failed on a point  of order. I know there are others who  have various ideas about this issue. It  is a legitimate issue, and I want my  colleagues to know this. It is a complicated  issue, because dealing with  credit cards, dealing with payday lenders, dealing with all sorts of different  entities, the matter of what is an excessive interest rate is one that many  Americans care deeply about and one  where they wish to see some restraint.  It  is  legitimate to point out that  there are interest rates being imposed  today that you would have gone to jail  for imposing not many years ago. In  fact, it would make a loan shark blush,  some of these interest rates that are  being charged. So what I intend to do  at some point, because I realize when  you look at the votes, there were only  about 30 votes dealing with the point of  order dealing with the motion of the  Senator from Vermont. But I think a  lot of my colleagues do not feel his desire was illegitimate; they were concerned about whether the rate was too  low or how it would apply.  So I am going to propose—I hope  along with my  friend and colleague  from Alabama—to ask either the Federal Reserve, or whatever else is the  appropriate place, to come back and  give us a comprehensive review of what  national rates there ought to be.  This idea that you can end up charging in effect 200, 300, or 400 percent interest rates, which is what has happened in some cases, is offensive, to put  it mildly. It ought to be wrong and illegal, and people ought not to be able to  get away with it.  I think  it  is difficult  for my colleagues to determine what is that level  and what institutions, and under what  financial circumstances, do you apply  it to. I realize a payday lender lends  money for a week or two, not annually.  So the interest rate will be different  than on a credit card, on a home mortgage, or what it is apt to be with a  credit union. With various institutions,  under various circumstances, rates can  differ.  It is confusing, except that most constituents and millions of Americans  would  like to see some restraint.  I  don’t know how you can possibly explain why some institutions can get  away with rates that are literally triple digits in some cases. I don’t think  we are going to resolve that matter on  this bill. But we ought to have some  clear  idea of how  to put  some  restraints on national usury laws. I am  not a Bible scholar, but for those who  are, I am sure they can recite chapter  and verse in the Old and New Testaments when it comes to the usurious  rates  that were  being  charged  by  money changers and the like.  At the appropriate time, I will propose an amendment that will allow us  to get back to people in a short period  with some analysis of how to impose  some meaningful restraints on what is  charged to consumers for the privilege  of borrowing money when they need it,  as so many do, to pay tuition, pay  mortgages, keep the business operating  and deal with the health care crisis, or  just to survive week to week. People  have been taken advantage of under  circumstances that are deplorable, in  my view, when the rates are particularly beyond excessive.  I think one should not read the outcome of the Sanders vote as a rejection  of the idea that applying some standards of fairness is unacceptable to this  body. I believe a lot of Members voted  against waiving the budget point of  order not because they disagreed with  what he is trying to do. I would not  want that vote to reflect that. I support Senator SANDERS, as I did on the  budget  debate,  not  because  I  necessarily agreed with the number he had  in mind, but because it is an important  debate and he should have had the  right to be able to proceed with his  amendment. I wanted to make that  point overall. I think it would be a  false impression to walk away and say  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:14 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13MY6.045 S13MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009
718,130,2009-05-13,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, in mid-  June, I asked Idahoans to share with  me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded by  the hundreds. The stories, numbering  well over 1,200, are heartbreaking and  touching. While  energy prices have  dropped  following  the  submissions,  those prices are now on the way back  up and the concerns expressed remain  very relevant. To respect the efforts of  those who  took  the opportunity  to  share their thoughts, I am submitting  every e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this purpose  to  Today marks the last of the submissions, a process that has taken approximately ten months to complete. But  this concern—our national energy policy—is not an issue that will be easily  resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. These stories not only detail their struggles to  meet everyday expenses, but also have  suggestions and recommendations as to  what Congress can do now to tackle  this problem and find solutions that  last beyond today. I ask unanimous  consent to have today’s letters printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  RECORD.  Not too long ago, I was considering purchase of a residential solar array. I have read  examples about people in other states (California, Massachusetts, etc.) who had implemented a solar array at home (including an  inverter), which enabled them to generate  some of their own power/electricity. Most  importantly, they are able to sell their excess power via the inverter to the grid when  they are not using it. This is an equal rate,  meaning that the utility company would buy  it at whatever their current rate was at that  time  of  day. Basically, your  electricity  meter  spins backwards according  to  the  amount you contribute to the utility. In this  way, people are able to  ‘‘bank’’ kilowatts  into the grid so that the power they used at  night was somewhat paid for (depending on  the size of their array, rate of usage and  amount of sunshine available, obviously).  After talking to some people  locally,  I  have heard that Idaho Power does not have  anything remotely like this policy in place.  In fact, it sounded like they are only required to pay 50% the value of the power  your array might generate and feed to the  grid via your inverter, and only for a set volume. After reaching a particular level, the  utility would be capturing a lot of that resident provider’s power for free. This appears  to be an unfair practice to me, and really  tramples on any incentive for buying and implementing a residential solar array. There  is a federal tax credit available, but that just  addresses start-up costs, not long-term usage  and maintenance.  I am no energy expert and do not claim to  have validated all of the data I put forth  above, but I am very interested in pursuing  a solar-energy based solution to cut my long-  term energy costs. Given the days of sun per  year in southwest Idaho, this seems like a  no-brainer.  Please tell me about your position on residential solar energy implementation practices here in Idaho, and specifically how you  would vote on a bill that would require our  local energy provider (read: Idaho Power) to  fairly compensate  residential energy providers, using the scenario I mentioned above.  This will directly impact how I vote in the  future.  JOHN, Boise.  Senator Crapo, this information seems to  be right on. I hope you will take the time to  read it.  MARY, Sandpoint.  Dear Mary,  On  several  occasions  in  the  past  few  months, I have written about the impact of  skyrocketing  fuel  prices  on  airline  customers—in their daily lives and when they  travel (Final Approach May 1 and Final Approach May 28). In the long run, to lower oil  prices for all Americans, we need to increase  domestic supply, increase exploration, alternative  energy  sources  and  conservation.  However, one near-term solution to the problem  is  for government to  investigate and  rein in oil speculators.  What is the Commodities Market?—Commodities are raw materials purchased by  manufacturers of finished products such as  food manufacturers, oil refiners or builders.  Businesses  that are highly dependent on  oil—refineries, heating oil dealers, airlines  and trucking companies among others—lessen their risk of significant price fluctuations  by purchasing future delivery contracts at  predetermined prices in what is known as  the commodities or  futures markets. The  two largest U.S. commodities markets or futures exchanges are the Chicago Mercantile  Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange, where people trade standardized futures contracts; that is, a contract to buy  specific quantities of a commodity at a specified price with delivery set at a specified  time in the future.  What is the Problem with Oil?—There is a  significant disconnect between  the paper  market for oil (speculators) and the physical  market for oil (consumers). In recent years,  speculators have taken advantage of actual  consumers of oil by bidding up the price for  futures contracts. If a speculator purchases a  contract for delivery of oil at a high price six  or 12 months in the future but has no intention of actually taking delivery of the oil in  that contract, then a physical customer who  needs that oil—to deliver home heating oil,  to operate trucks or airplanes, or even to  process in a refinery—will be forced to pay  the higher price in order to obtain the oil  that is needed.  How Do They Get Away with That?—Increasingly, sophisticated institutional investors have managed to manipulate the rules  and  regulations  governing  commodities  transactions through a series of exemptions  and waivers, including the so-called ‘‘Enron  loophole,’’ low margin requirements and the  dodging of U.S. public disclosure requirements. These complex arrangements have a  similar impact: They put people engaged in  oil-related businesses at a disadvantage with  those who gamble relatively small sums that  the price of oil will increase out of proportion to marketplace demands. If that happens, as it has regularly over the past few  years, those who need oil for their businesses  pay a premium, which is passed on to you—  the consumer.  What Can Government Do Now?—In the  near term, Congress needs to address the impact of unchecked speculation in the commodities market.  Commodities  trading  is  overseen  by  a  small, but very powerful government agency  known as the Commodities Futures Trading  Commission  (CFTC). Congress can require  the CFTC to implement a host of controls  such as imposing limits on the quantity of  commodities contracts speculators may purchase, closing the loopholes that allow speculators to trade exempt from any government oversight or regulation, and requiring  reporting by those who are engaging in speculation.  Experts say that closing regulatory loopholes in the trading of commodity futures  will result in a significant reduction in fuel  prices.  What’s Next?—Congress is expected to debate some of these issues in the next few  weeks and it is urgent that they hear your  voice. To facilitate public participation in  the  debate  over  speculators,  we  have  launched  a  broad-based  coalition, S.O.S.  NOW, that provides a wide array of information on speculation and its impact on the  price we all pay for oil. S.O.S. NOW stands  for Stop Oil Speculation Now,  and we  urge  you  to  go  to  the  Web  site  www.stopoilspeculationnow.com and send a  message to Congress about oil speculation.

721,158,2009-05-13,Mr. MARCHANT.," Madam Speaker, Mr. Ma  Ying-jeou was inaugurated as President of Republic of China (Taiwan) on May 20, 2008.  During the last twelve months there has been  a considerable reduction of tension across the  Taiwan Strait and there have been productive  talks between the two sides on issues such as  direct airline flights, an economic accord protecting  investments, more  tourist  visits by  mainlanders to Taiwan.  President Ma has also been working closely  with the U.S. government. The mutual relationship between our two countries is strong. We  hope that the relations will grow even stronger  in all areas, including trade, science and technology, educational exchange, military sales  and  Taiwan’s  participation  in  international  agencies.  It  is heartening  to  learn  that Taiwan has  been invited to attend this year’s World Health  Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, Switzerland from  May 19 to May 27 as an observer. This is a  breakthrough for the Taiwanese government; it  is Taiwan’s first participation in a formal U.N  activity  since 1971, when  the world body  switched its recognition to mainland China.  In celebrating President Ma’s first anniversary  in office,  I  join my Congressional colleagues in hoping that Taiwan’s participation  in the WHA this May will lead to Taiwan’s future successes  in  returning  to other  international organizations.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE VETERANS  GROUP  LIFE  INSURANCE  IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2009  HON. STEVE BUYER  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
722,158,2009-05-13,Mr. BUYER.," Madam Speaker,  today  I am  introducing the Veterans’ Group Life Insurance  Improvement Act of 2009 which increases the  amount of life insurance available to veterans.  Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI) is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The purpose of this program is to give  veterans  the  option  to  convert  their  Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI)  coverage  that  they carry when  they are  in  service to a competitive life insurance product  for them and their family in post-military life.  Under current law, veterans have up to one  year to convert the amount of SGLI coverage  they  carry  to  VGLI.  Many  separating  servicemembers are young and don’t see the  need to carry a large amount of life insurance  coverage. However, as  they get older and  have a family, many of these servicemembers  have expressed a desire  to purchase additional coverage but are barred from doing so  under current law.  The Veterans’ Group Life  Insurance  Improvement Act of 2009 allows veterans to purchase up  to $400,000 of VGLI coverage  in  $50,000 increments, every five years, until the  age of 60. The costs of such increases in coverage will be offset by premiums veterans pay,  so there is no direct cost to the government.  This bill gives our veterans greater flexibility in  their  life  insurance choices and  I urge all  members to co-sponsor and support this legislation.  f  A TRIBUTE TO CONSTANCE V HAY-  ALLEYNE  HON.

Not  only do these officers ride to remember their  fallen brothers and sisters, but they also raise  money for the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, which commemorates the service  and sacrifice of law enforcement officers.  We must never forget that we are kept safe  because of those who take up the charge as  law enforcement officers. This week, I join with  the 9th District of North Carolina and my colleagues  in honoring and remembering  these  brave men and women who are the truest example of American heroes.  IN HONOR OF GEORGE AND  ROSEMARY ESSEFF  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. B.S.  TURNER  HON. ELTON GALLEGLY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
725,165,2009-05-13,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  honor George and Rosemary Esseff: entrepreneurs,  philanthropists, American  patriots  and world citizens.  George and Rosemary are being honored  this week by Many Mansions, a nonprofit organization  in my district  that has been providing hope, homes, and  life-enriching services to homeless and low-income citizens for  30 years. George and Rosemary are among  those who have had a strong and generous  hand in Many Mansions’ success.  I have the privilege of calling George and  Rosemary my friends.  George and Rosemary are the epitome of  the American success story. George began  his career  in 1951 as a chemist/metallurgist  for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before  striking out on his own and going on to become one of the world’s most successful titanium entrepreneurs.  Along the way, George and Rosemary have  used their wealth to help those in need also  have  the opportunity  to become successful.  One example  is $1 million  they donated  to  Many Mansions for a housing project several  years ago—only part of their legacy with Many  Mansions.  George and Rosemary are devout Catholics  and George’s brother, John, is a monsignor.  The  family  traces  their  roots  to Lebanon.  Three years ago, George, Rosemary, John  and their grandson, Andrew, traveled to Lebanon to further their humanitarian work, including donating equipment  to a hospital. Monsignor Esseff planned  to  lead a  retreat  for  nuns belonging to the Missionaries of Charity,  the order founded by Mother Teresa,  Then war broke out. It was not the first time  the Esseffs found themselves in wartime Lebanon and  it only cemented  their belief  that  their help is needed and beneficial.  One avenue  for  their philanthropy  is The  Esseff Foundation, which  they  founded  in  1979  in memory of his grandfather, George  Abdanour Esseff. The Esseff Foundation is a  non-political, non-profit organization dedicated  to relieving the sufferings of the poor both in  America and around the world.  In pursuit of that goal, the foundation funnels  its  resources  to  those  organizations  whose track records demonstrate their abilities  to assist and house the homeless, feed and  clothe the poor and provide medical care to  those in need.  George takes his politics as seriously as he  takes business and philanthropy. He spelled  out his beliefs and what it means to be a Republican and a patriotic American in an ad titled, ‘‘What I Am,’’ that ran in the Washington  Post on October 20, 2004.  Mr. Speaker, George and Rosemary Esseff  mirror the American Dream and have been instrumental  in helping others pull  themselves  up and realize  the Dream  for  themselves.  I  know my colleagues will join me in thanking  them  for being role models  for Americans—  striving for success honorably and morally and  bringing others along with you with generosity  and compassion—and in congratulating them  for their well deserved honors.

RICHARD E. NEAL  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
728,165,2009-05-13,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation that will  end practices that obstruct women from attaining affordable insurance policies on the individual market. The Women’s Health Insurance  Act of 2009 would end discrimination against  those women looking for health coverage who  either do not have access  to an employee-  sponsored plan or those who earn too much  money to qualify for Medicaid. Recent findings  from  the Kaiser  Family  Foundation  have  shown  that 5.7 million American women  in  2007 received health  insurance on  the  individual market. During  this difficult economic  climate and with unemployment rising, it is becoming much more  likely  that more women  will be looking for health coverage through individual insurance markets.  Unfortunately it is common practice in the  individual market today to charge women higher premiums than men for the identical coverage. Individual market insurers also can limit  coverage due to pregnancy or delivery methods. This is because individual market insurers have the ability to deny coverage based  on a ‘‘pre-existing condition.’’ For instance, a  woman who has had a Cesarean section in  the past can currently be charged a higher  premium, imposed a waiting period, or denied  coverage until she has been sterilized or can  no longer bear children. The vast majority of  these policies also do not provide coverage for  maternity care. These conditions exist  today  because there is no federal protection to stop  these practices on policies sold  in  the  individual market.  Due  to  the aforementioned problems,  the  Women’s Health  Insurance Fairness Act of  2009 is that much more important. This legislation will prevent  insurers  in  the  individual  market from charging women higher premiums  than men. The current practice is gender discrimination and should not be accepted in today’s  system.  This  gender  rating  harms  women by not only inflating premiums, but by  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:24 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A13MY8.019 E13MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
729,172,2009-05-13,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," Madam Speaker,  I would like to request the House’s attention  today  to pay recognition  to a constituent of  mine, Mrs. Cynthia C. Snider.  Cindy has been named Teacher of the Year  at Ohatchee High School  in Ohatchee, Alabama for the 2008–09 school year.  Cindy was born  in Mississippi  to Eugene  and Bobbie Champion and was the oldest of  five children. Her paternal grandmother, Carol  Champion, was a teacher in Highland Home,  Alabama and always encouraged Cindy  to  love learning. Cindy grew up in Montgomery,  Alabama and graduated from Auburn University with a degree in Accounting.  After spending her career working as an  English as a Second Language Instructor for  Anniston City Schools,  she went back  to  school at Jacksonville State University and  earned her teaching certificate.  She has been  the Spanish Teacher at  Ohatchee High School since 2005.  f  VERONICA BELL  HON. ED PERLMUTTER  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009

Veronica Bell is an 8th grader at Drake Middle  School and received this award because her  determination and hard work have allowed her  to overcome adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by Veronica  Bell is exemplary of the type of achievement  that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential that students at all levels strive to make the most of their education  and develop a work ethic that will guide them  for the rest of their lives.

735,6,2009-06-02,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I’m pleased to bring to the House for  its consideration this legislation sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. STUPAK). This bill makes a minor  technical correction to a land patent  issued by the Secretary of the Interior  to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society.  In 1997, Congress directed the Secretary to grant a land patent transferring a portion of the Whitefish Point  Coast Guard Light Station to the society for the purposes of developing a  public museum dedicated to shipping  on the Great Lakes, including the well-  known  tragedy of  the S.S. Edmund  Fitzgerald, an iron ore carrier lost on  Lake Superior in 1975.  A condition of the patent was that  the use of the  land conform to the  Whitefish Point Comprehensive Plan of  1992. That plan has been replaced by a  new  document,  the December  2002  Human Use/Natural Resource Plan for  Whitefish Point. This bill strikes the  reference to the old plan and replaces  it with the title of the current document.  Congressman  has worked  diligently on behalf of this legislation.  The museum is one of the most popular  attractions in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and Mr. STUPAKhas been a great  advocate on its behalf.  I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1280  and urge  its adoption by the House  today.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
736,6,2009-06-02,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to speak on H.R. 1280, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 1280 has been well explained by  the majority, and we support the legislation.  STUPAK CHRISTENSEN At this point, I would reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

738,6,2009-06-02,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today as the author of H.R. 1280. I  would like to thank the chairman and  ranking member of the Interior Committee, Mrs.  and Mr.  LAMBORN, and the committee staff for  their  assistance  in moving  forward  with this legislation.  H.R. 1280  is a straightforward bill  that would allow the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society to implement  the new Human Use/Natural Resource  Management Plan for the Great Lakes  Shipwreck Museum in Chippewa County, Michigan.  We have passed identical legislation  on suspension out of the House of Representatives in the 109th and 110th sessions of Congress before, but it was not  considered by the Senate. I am hopeful,  with the House acting early this year  in this legislative session, that the legislation we pass today will allow the  Senate ample time to consider and approve this legislation.  The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society is a nonprofit organization  dedicated to preserving the history of  shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. Since  1992, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has operated the Great  Lakes Shipwreck Museum to educate  the public about shipwrecks in the region. The museum provides exhibits on  several shipwrecks in the area, including an in-depth exhibit on the Edmund  Fitzgerald, which was lost with her entire crew of 29 men near Whitefish  Point, Michigan, on November 10, 1975.  Among the items on display is the 200-  pound bronze bell recovered from the  wreckage in 1995, as a memorial to her  lost crew.  In 2002, the Great Lakes Shipwreck  Historical Society, working with the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  the  Michigan Audubon Society, and  the  local community finalized a new management plan to improve the experience at the museum. The new management  plan, which was  signed  and  agreed upon by the interested parties,  will allow the historical society to expand the museum’s exhibits while addressing concerns about parking and  access to surrounding wildlife areas.  However, because the original land patent references the previous management plan,  legislation to amend the  patent  is necessary before  the new  management plan can be implemented.  H.R. 1280 amends the land grant patent to allow the new management plan  to be implemented. Congressman CAMP  of Michigan has joined me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I thank him  for his support.  The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has continuously improved  the experience at the museum since it  was established in 1992. With the approval of H.R. 1280, Congress will allow  the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum to  further develop this cultural and historical resource.  I encourage my colleagues to support  this simple legislation which would improve the opportunities available to  visitors of Chippewa County, Michigan,  and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum.  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  me time.  ",2009

I have full confidence in your courage,  devotion to duty, and skill in battle.’’;  Whereas the naval assault phase on Normandy was code-named ‘‘Neptune’’, and the  June 6th assault date is referred to a D-Day  to denote the day on which the combat attack was initiated;  Whereas significant aerial bombardments  and operations  (including Operation Fortitude) by Allied forces during the weeks and  months leading up to, and in support of Operation Overlord, played a significant role in  the success of the Normandy landings;  Whereas  more  than  13,000  soldiers  parachuted, and several hundred soldiers of  the glider units participating in Mission Detroit and Mission Chicago  landed, behind  enemy lines to secure landing fields in the 24  hours preceding the amphibious landing;  Whereas soldiers of six divisions  (three  American, two British and one Canadian)  stormed ashore in five main landing areas on  beaches  in Normandy, which were  code-  named  ‘‘Utah’’,  ‘‘Omaha’’,  ‘‘Gold’’,  ‘‘Juno’’  and ‘‘Sword’’;  Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest  single amphibious assault in history, consisting of approximately 31,000 members of  the United States Armed Forces and more  than 3,000 vehicles, which embarked on 208  vessels from Weymouth and Portland, England;  Whereas, of the estimated 9,400 casualties  incurred by Allied troops on the first day of  the  landing, an estimated 5,400 casualties  were members of the United States Armed  Forces;  Whereas only five days after the initial  landing, Allied troops secured a beachhead  that was 50 miles long and 12 miles deep and  was occupied by more than 325,000 soldiers;  Whereas on July 25, 1944, Allied Forces  launched Operation COBRA to break out of  the beachhead and began the liberation of  France, which contributed to the destruction  of the Nazi regime on May 7, 1945; and  Whereas members of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ assumed the task of freeing the world  from Nazi and Fascist regimes and restoring  liberty to Europe: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) recognizes the 65th anniversary of the  Allied amphibious landing on D-Day, June 6,  1944, at Normandy, France, during World  War II;  (2) expresses its gratitude and appreciation  to the members of the United States Armed  Forces who participated in Operation Overlord; and  (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United  States to observe the anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor  the sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to  liberate Europe.

I rise not only to recognize a day  whose historical significance cannot be  overstated, but  to express gratitude  and appreciation to the members of the  United  States  Armed  Forces  who  served in defense of freedom that day,  and throughout the campaign.

768,41,2009-06-02,Mr.  TONKO.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  evening we have an opportunity as  members of the freshman class, Democratic members, to speak during an  hour designated for our class members.  Tonight is the second time our class  has spoken as a group, and as you recognize, we are a diverse group of members who come from all sections and regions of the country and do share some  common fabric but also would identify  differences. But one thing very certainly in common that we share is the  need to move forward with a positive  direction on energy policy that will  spark  an  innovation  economy, Mr.  Speaker.  And so this evening during this opportunity we will hear from my colleagues in our freshman class that will  speak to their concerns and the optimism we share about growing an innovation economy based on energy policy  that can transform just how we deal  with those resources, how we create  our generated power that we require,  how we transmit that power, and certainly how we can effectuate conservation and efficiency programs that will  strengthen our outcome.  As you know, I have spent much of  my life with energy policy. My professional  life  found me working  in the  State Assembly in New York chairing  the Energy Committee  for  some  15  years, and then I moved on to become  president and CEO of NYSERTA, the  New York State Energy, Research and  Development Authority.  It was there that I recognized that  through the program implementation  we had encouraged through public policy formation that we were able to effectuate tremendously strong impacts,  positive impacts on the business community and on the residential community, making certain that as we embraced efficiency efforts we could address that demand side of the equation,  which has been, from a Federal perspective, not  really addressed effectively at all.  And so now we find ourselves with  leadership in the White House and certainly here in the House that wants to  move forward and make certain that  we advance sound energy policy. It is  important for us to do that in a way  that maintains an open mind to developing the sort of policy that needs to  be crafted, policy that will speak to  those  innovative  ideas, and projects  that will find us investing in research,  in development, in deployment, in engineering, in developing a green-collar  workforce, all of which will create an  array of jobs that are not yet on that  radar  screen,  that will allow us  to  produce outcomes that are favorable to  this country’s economy.  And certainly as we do that, we will  need to update and upgrade our transmission  grid,  our  delivery  system,  which was designed for regulatory response rather than free-wheeling electrons from different regions and sections of the country, or to even imports from our neighbor to the north in  Canada with hydropower that has been  done in some situations. We need to  make certain that we address both supply-side and demand-side solutions. For  far too long, we’re increasing supply  but not looking at that opportunity to  create here  in America those needs  that are addressed by American-produced  power  that  obviously would  strengthen our economy and our job  situation.  It allows us to also move forward to  create a more clean and more sustainable environment which needs to be a  goal that is embraced by the policy  that we’ll formulate.  You know, Mr. Speaker, it has been  said often that a crisis is a terrible  thing to waste. Well, there are multiple  crises that this President inherited, he  and his administration. Certainly the  House, as a leadership, is addressing  those crises that have been passed on  here to not only legislators and policymakers  and  executives  but  to  the  American public where we  struggle  with situations that for far too long  have gone unaddressed.  You know, I liken this to the space  race that we had decades ago, where  this country came behind its leadership, where President Kennedy  indicated that we could place a person on  the Moon, where he boldly expressed  that vision, and we were able to go forward and invest in science and technology. Sputnik was mentioned  in  every  classroom. There was a  race  going on, and it was important for us  to win that race.  The same can be said today with the  global race that exists out there for  some Nation to emerge as that go-to  Nation that will export the energy intellect and the energy innovation and  ideas that will transform not only our  economy but the worldwide use and the  worldwide  response  to energy needs  and energy solutions. We can win that  race but we need to invest. We need to  open up with new policy, and we need  to commit to resources that are essential.  We are doing that today as we talk  about the transformation to an innovation economy, and as we look at some  of the situations that we have with the  power that is addressed by foreign oil  imports, noting that nearly 67 percent  of our oil is imported from foreign supplies, from foreign countries, that is  finding we’re spending some $475 billion  that is shipped overseas. People will  talk about different economic impacts  or concerns or fears that they try to  forecast and project, when in fact we  need only to look at history to see  what’s been happening with the hundreds of billions that are invested in  foreign  economies  and  an  overwhelming, near two-thirds, of our supply for oil being imported from foreign  countries.  This  should  tell us  something.  It  should tell us that there are opportunities to create jobs to go forward and  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:20 Jun 03, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A02JN7.051 H02JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
769,48,2009-06-02,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, I thank the gentleman from Missouri. Your overview of this, your reference to real science is refreshing. In  the debate and most of the debate of  the majority party here,  it’s not so  much based on real science as political  science  or  even,  to  some  degree,  science fiction. And so, to look at why  this—and I looked at every piece of legislation in terms of cost benefits. And  when we look at the benefits of this, I  think human activity,  it’s acknowledged, does contribute towards carbon  dioxide emissions. But it’s less than 4  percent. To put that into perspective,  forest fires, wildfires contribute 10 percent of CO2emissions. And so not even  with the debate of, you know, are we  warming the Earth or not warming the  Earth, there’s a lot of smart folks out  there that are publishing research or  earning their dissertations based on debating that science. But what the experts agree upon, the researchers agree  is, human activity is less than 4 percent  contributes  towards CO2 emissions.  You know, in terms of the cap-and-  trade,  cap-and-tax  that  we’re  discussing——  ",2009
770,48,2009-06-02,Mr. AKIN.," Could I interrupt you just  a minute because I thought you were  on a rather important topic, because  the whole crux of the idea for this huge  tax proposal and all kinds of sweeping  changes and government power and influence and regulation is based on the  fact that CO2 is such a bad thing, and  it’s based on the assumption that the  CO2 that we’re releasing by burning  fossil fuels is creating some kind of a  problem.  I mean,  that’s  the whole  linchpin  that  this  debate  is  going  around.  And yet you have, here’s kind of an  interesting quote here. And I think I’d  like to get into this just a little bit.  Here’s a former U.S. Senator and he  says, we’ve got  to  ride  the global  warming issue. Even if the theory of  global warming is wrong, we’ll be doing  the right thing in terms of economic  policy and environmental policy.  So, in other words, there’s a solution  that they have in mind, whether global  warming is going on or not. And the  thing that’s been embarrassing, you’ve  noticed we don’t hear as much global  warming. We hear climate change, and  the reason is because the planet has  not really been warming the last number of years as all of these economic  models were saying that it was going  to. And that doesn’t necessarily mean  the CO2 that we’ve generated hasn’t  created some warming. It just seems  that the world climate is more connected to sunspot activity than these  other things.  But here you’re just talking about  the effect of CO2, and I thought this  was interesting. This is how much does  the human activity affect greenhouse  gases? The block in light blue here represents all the greenhouse gases, which  comprise only 2 percent of the total atmosphere. So this is all the greenhouse  gases.  And that yellow block over there on  the end is the CO2. And the little tiny  red block inside the yellow block is the  part that our human activity is creating. And so the question is, in terms  of leverage, does this little red dot over  here have that much impact on the climate?  And this is, I don’t think anybody  disputes the percentages of these gases  and the mixture. So the question then  is, is this stuff that we’re doing really  that important?  And you just said the forest fires,  which were created by poor environmental policy by the way, a  lot of  them, because we’re not allowed to  clean that brush out, the underbrush,  and then it burns everything and burns  Bambi and snowy owls and everything  else because we didn’t want to clear  the brush out, and that’s generating,  what is that, 21⁄2times more than all of  the coal and oil and things we burn.  I didn’t mean to interrupt you, but I  think it’s important for us to stick on  what science, what really does science  say. And this is not an easy thing for  any scientist to figure out, is it, because what’s happening is there’s all  sorts of things that play together, and  so, the CO2we generate could be warming the planet some, but it could be  also that we’re in a time where the  planet is growing colder. So all of that,  we don’t really understand that totally, do we?  ",2009
771,48,2009-06-02,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania., I  think the gentleman points out an important point. These are all based on  models and strictly speculation.  ,2009
772,48,2009-06-02,Mr. AKIN., Some of the models said  that we’re going to have surf at the  front steps of the Capitol pretty soon.  I was really looking forward to that.  Go ahead. I yield.  ,2009
773,48,2009-06-02,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, and the purpose overall of this is  to really eliminate all energy other  than green energy. And today, I mean,  the energy sources that are only seen  as viable by the majority party under  cap-and-tax  are,  frankly,  solar  and  wind. And today, that represents less  than 1 percent of meeting our energy  needs in this country.  So say we work real hard and we give  it that Manhattan Project, and we absolutely double that, the energy capacity of solar and wind, well, that’s 2 percent. We still have a huge gap that this  country has that we need to be able to  fuel our vehicles, heat our homes.  And I’m from a very rural district.  The folks in my area, we have some  pretty harsh,  frigid winters, and we  need to heat our homes. We commute  in my home for work, for groceries.  You know, frankly, a lot of folks in my  area commute  just to pick up their  mail. And the cost of cap-and-tax, I believe, is projected, well, with, just on  gasoline alone to increase by over 70  percent.  ",2009

Ms. McCarthy  has worked tirelessly to make Connecticut’s air, land and water cleaner,  which in turn has made Connecticut  the wonderful place it is today to live,  work and raise a family.  Among her achievements,  I would  like to highlight Ms. McCarthy’s pioneering  work  to  address  climate  change in New England. She is widely  recognized as a chief engineer of the  very  successful Regional Greenhouse  Gas Initiative. Since her appointment  in 2004, Ms. McCarthy has worked to  dramatically  improve  Connecticut’s  environment. She has restored and defended the integrity of many of Connecticut’s  most  cherished  natural  treasures. She devoted herself to protecting Long Island Sound, a source of  nourishment and recreation to the millions who  live and work along  its  coastline.  As  commissioner,  Ms.  McCarthy devised strategies for dealing with our State’s solid waste, and  she worked to improve Connecticut’s  air quality. She also made great strides  to  reinvigorate our parks and open  spaces.  Gina arrived in Connecticut with a  wealth of experience after holding a  number of health and environmental  positions in Massachusetts at the local,  State and Federal levels. She worked  for the Stoughton Board of Health and  Conservation,  Massachusetts’  Hazardous Waste Facility  Site  Safety  Council, the Massachusetts Toxics Use  Reduction Program and the New England Governor’s Environment  Committee. Ms. McCarthy also served as  the under secretary of policy at the  Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs and as the deputy  secretary of operations to the Office for  Commonwealth  Development  where  she oversaw the development and implementation of Massachusetts’  first  Climate Protection Action Plan.  We have been lucky to have Gina in  Connecticut and I am excited that the  entire country will now benefit from  her talents at the EPA. In her new position, Ms. McCarthy will be responsible for developing national programs,  technical policies and regulations to  control air pollution and prevent exposure to radiation. She will continue her  work to address climate change and  improve  energy  efficiency—a  double  charge that is both timely and imperative to the continued health of our  planet. She will also develop strategies  to reduce industrial and vehicle-generated air pollution as she works to improve indoor and outdoor air quality. I  am excited to have someone of Ms.  McCarthy’s character and credentials  leading these essential efforts and I am  filled with confidence in her ability to  address them productively.  I strongly support the nomination of  Gina McCarthy to head the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation and urge my  colleagues to do the same.  ",2009
780,69,2009-06-02,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today in support of the nomination of  Regina McCarthy to be Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at  the Environmental Protection Agency.  I would also like to thank Chairman  BOXERand the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee  for their support of this excellent and  deserving nominee. While I think it is  regrettable that her confirmation was  delayed for so long, I am glad that she  will soon be able to get to work on  finding solutions to the many important environmental issues facing our  nation.  I congratulate President Obama on  nominating such a remarkably qualified, energetic, and passionate  individual to serve as Assistant Administrator. Commissioner McCarthy has 25  years of experience working at all levels of local and State government and  has a depth and breadth of knowledge  on environmental issues that few can  rival. She has also served under both  Democratic and Republican Governors,  in Massachusetts as well as my home  State of Connecticut. In both States  and in all capacities, Gina has been  universally recognized as a uniquely  talented environmental advocate.

782,76,2009-06-02,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, I come to  the floor because the Senate this week  is considering a new regulatory bill for  the tobacco industry and there will be  Members who will come to the floor to  say: We have tried to do this for 10  years. This is well past due.  Well, in part they are right. This bill  was produced 10 years ago. It has not  changed. It is exactly what was produced. But let me try to fill in some  history for the Members of the Senate.  In 1998, we passed the FDA Modernization Act. I was the lead sponsor  of that bill in the House of Representatives. We spent 21⁄2years developing a  bill to modernize the Food and Drug  Administration.  Most Americans do not even realize  what the Food and Drug Administration is. It is an agency in the Federal  Government that regulates 25 cents of  every dollar in our economy. It is what  assures every American that when you  go to the pharmacy and you get a drug,  there is a Federal agency that has determined that drug is, one, safe, and,  two, effective; or that when you go to  a hospital or a doctor’s office, and they  take a medical device—maybe  it  is  something that permits them to go inside your body without cutting you  open—that device has gone through an  extensive review by the FDA.  In some cases, pharmaceutical products take up to 12 to 14 years for approval—the amount of clinical trials to  prove safety and efficacy that we go  through, not just on animals but on humans—but it assures every American  that the gold standard in the world exists right here in the United States of  America. We put manufacturers and  their products through a test at the  FDA like no other country does. As a  matter of  fact, when  the European  Union was created and there were efforts to try to harmonize our approval  process in the United States with that  of Europe, what we found was that Europe’s adoption, then, of 15 countries  was that they take any of the 15 countries’ approval process. What we found  in the United States was it was hard  for us to find one country that had as  rigid  a  requirement  as  the United  States of America; therefore, we didn’t  harmonize. For that reason, there are  drugs that are approved in the European Union that are not approved in  the United States because they either  haven’t met the test of the FDA or  they have chosen not to go through the  test.  The reason I share all of that with  my colleagues  is that  for 21⁄2 years,  there were two focuses of those of us  who worked on FDA modernization:  one was to make sure we had an agency  that could perform  its task of efficiency, and two, that we did nothing to  change the gold standard—the assurance  the American people had  that  every time they got a prescription,  every time there was a device, that the  gold standard was intact, that it was  safe and effective.

784,90,2009-06-02,Mr. WYDEN.," Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me tell the  distinguished Senator from Oklahoma  that I very much appreciate working  with him on health care legislation. We  did it in the House, and we are going to  do it again. I think this time the Senate is going to make history and have  comprehensive health  reform, and  I  look forward to working with my colleague on it.  I come here today to express my  strong support for the Family Smoking  Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.  The lead sponsor of this legislation is,  of course, Senator KENNEDY. I say ‘‘of  course’’ because the fact is, for four  decades  Senator  often  against great odds, has consistently  come back again and again to lead the  fight to improve health care for the  people of our country. Sometimes it  was for children. Sometimes it was for  seniors. Sometimes it was for the disabled. Sometimes it was for those who  have suffered mental illness. I could go  on and on, and we would be here until  breakfast  time  if  I were  to  try  to  itemize all of  the major pieces of  health reform legislation Senator KENNEDYhas authored over the last four  decades. It is very appropriate that he  is the lead sponsor of this legislation.  The fact is, after Congress passes this  important bill and takes steps to improve public health, we will be very  fortunate  that Senator KENNEDY is  going to lead the Senate once more on  comprehensive health reform. I wish to  make clear as a member of the Senate  Finance Committee  that  I am very  much looking forward to Senator KENNEDY’s involvement in this issue and  his championing of the cause of fixing  American health care. He has been the  leader on this issue for four decades.  I come to this topic with I think a  personal perspective that also affects  my role as a policymaker. In 1994, when  I was a Member of the House, I served  on the Health and Environment Subcommittee. It was chaired by HENRY  WAXMAN, a great champion of trying to  protect children against the dangers of  tobacco. Chairman WAXMAN had the  CEOs of major tobacco companies before his subcommittee. He put all of  the CEOs under oath, and as expected,  Chairman WAXMAN did a tremendous  job in terms of laying out the case for  public health. In fact, he was so effective, that by the time it came to my  turn, I was hard-pressed to find a question he hadn’t already asked the tobacco CEOs. Just as I was thinking  about packing up, I turned to some of  Chairman WAXMAN’s  staff, who  are  wonderful public servants, and I asked  whether any of the members of our  committee had asked the tobacco executives if they thought nicotine was  addictive. The staff all told me nobody  had. They said: You ought to ask them.  I wish to take a minute to lay out that  historical record of what happened.  I asked each one of the tobacco executives that day back in April of 1994  whether they thought nicotine was addictive. The president of Philip Morris  spoke first and said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive, Yes.  Then the chairman and CEO of Reynolds Tobacco Company  spoke  and  said:  Mr. Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine  clearly do not meet the classic definition of  addiction. There is no intoxication.  Then the president of U.S. Tobacco  spoke. He said:  I don’t believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.  The chairman and CEO of Lorillard  said:  I believe that nicotine is not addictive.  The chairman and CEO of the Liggett  Group said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.  The chairman and CEO of Brown &  Williamson said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.  Finally, the president and CEO of  American Tobacco said:  I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive.  I made a vow after I had asked that  question that during the time I would  have the honor of serving in the House  and later the Senate, to make an effort  to do everything I could to hold tobacco companies and other companies  that mislead the American people accountable. Today, we are able to do  that because of the outstanding leadership of Chairman KENNEDY. He is giving us the opportunity to hold accountable the tobacco companies that mislead the public with respect to their  marketing practices and with respect  to advertising. The Kennedy legislation  is, in my view, very much needed to  protect the public health—particularly  the health of our young people—because it will give us the authority to  hold the tobacco companies accountable for their actions.  This  is also  relevant  to  the next  major health bill that we will be dealing with in the Senate which will take  the form of comprehensive health reform—health reform that ensures all  Americans have good, quality, affordable coverage and, particularly, does so  in a way that holds costs down.  I, gratefully, had a chance to meet  with the President today at the White  House. The President, who has clearly  signaled this will be a top priority for  him, has now sent the message that  history, to a great extent, is going to  judge us on our ability to hold down  runaway health costs and cut costs for  American families.  In my home State alone, $1.1 billion  in health care costs are directly attributed to smoking per year, and it costs  the Oregon Medicaid Program nearly  $287 million per year. Nationwide, $96  billion in health care costs are directly  attributed to smoking. This includes  $24.7 billion in smoking-caused Medicare expenditures.  There are enormous financial costs  specifically associated with people at  an early age getting addicted to tobacco use. Then, of course, there is the  extraordinary loss of life that comes  about as a result of tobacco. According  to the Centers for Disease Control, in  the United States, over 400,000 deaths  each year are directly attributable to  tobacco use. The FDA has given the authority to regulate food and prescription drugs, and  it  certainly makes  sense that the FDA regulates tobacco,  which is responsible for the death of  over 400,000 Americans per year.  The Senate, because of the leadership  of Senator KENNEDY, has the unique opportunity to reduce the financial and  human toll of tobacco. I wished to recount, briefly, that hearing in 1994, because ever since that time, when the  tobacco  executives  said under  oath  that nicotine wasn’t addictive, I have  wished to be part of an effort to hold  the  tobacco  companies  accountable  when they mislead the American people. As a result of the outstanding leadership of Chairman KENNEDY, it is possible  for the Senate to  finally hold  these companies accountable by passing this legislation. I hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will join  me and Chairman KENNEDY in  supporting this long overdue bill.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

788,90,2009-06-02,Mr. DURBIN.," Madam President, this  week the Senate takes up a bill that is  long overdue. It is a historic opportunity  for us to  finally protect our  children in this country from tobacco  addiction. I didn’t realize, when I was  elected to the House of Representatives, in 1982, that the issue of tobacco  would be a major part of my congressional activity. My family, similar to  virtually every family in America, has  been touched with tobacco death. My  father died when he was 53 years old of  lung cancer. I was 14 years old. He  smoked two packs of Camels a day  back in the 1950s, when even doctors  were saying in magazines how safe it  was to smoke. His cough was a sound I  will carry to the grave in my memory.  When I hear that smoker’s cough, I can  pick it out of a crowd. As a kid, I heard  it over and over, night after night, day  after day, until he passed away on November 13, 1959. That is my story on tobacco. Every family in America has a  story to tell.

789,97,2009-06-02,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today with my colleague Senator LINCOLN to introduce the Nurse Faculty  and Physical Therapist Education Act  of 2009. This legislation will help to address the critical shortage of nurse faculty and physical therapists that  is  facing  our Nation. The  nationwide  nursing shortage  is growing rapidly,  because the average age of the nursing  workforce is near retirement and because  the aging population has  increased health care needs. The shortage is one that affects the entire Nation. A 2006 Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, report estimated  that  the  national  nursing  shortage would more than triple, to  more than one million nurses, by the  year 2020. The report also predicts that  all 50 States will experience nursing  shortages by 2015. Quite simply, we  need to educate more nurses, or we, as  a Nation, will not have enough trained  nurses to meet the needs of our aging  society.  One of the biggest constraints to educating more nurses  is a shortage of  nursing faculty. Almost three-quarters  of nursing programs surveyed by the  American Association of Colleges of  Nursing cited faculty shortages as a  reason for turning away qualified applicants.  Although  applications  to  nursing programs have surged 59 percent over the past decade, the National  League  for Nursing  estimates  that  147,000  qualified  applications  were  turned away in 2004. This represents a  27 percent decrease in admissions over  the previous year, indicating the need  to scale up capacity in nursing programs is more critical than ever.  I know that in my home State of New  Mexico, nursing programs turned down  almost half  of  qualified  applicants,  even though HRSA predicts that New  Mexico will only be able to meet 64 percent of its demand for nurses by 2020.  With a national nurse faculty workforce that averages 53.5 years of age,  and an average nurse faculty retirement age of 62.5 years, we cannot and  must not wait any longer to address  nurse faculty shortages.  Nursing faculty are not the only segment of the population that is aging.  As  the baby boom generation ages,  there will be an  increased need  for  nurses to care for the elderly. However,  less  than one percent of practicing  nurses have a certification  in geriatrics.  The Nurse Faculty  and Physical  Therapist Education Act will amend  the Public Health Service Act, to help  alleviate the faculty shortage by providing funds to help nursing schools increase enrollment and graduation from  nursing doctoral programs. The act  will increase partnering opportunities  between  academic  institutions  and  medical practices, enhance cooperative  education,  support marketing  outreach, and strengthen mentoring programs. The bill will increase the number of nurses who complete nursing  doctoral programs and seek employment as faculty members and nursing  leaders in academic institutions. In addition, the bill authorizes awards to  train nursing faculty in clinical geriatrics, so that more nursing students  will be equipped for our aging population.  By addressing the faculty shortage,  we are addressing the nursing shortage.  The aging population will also require  additional  health workers  in  other fields. Physical therapy was listed as one of the fastest growing occupations by  the U.S. Department of  Labor, with a projected job growth of  greater than 36 percent between 2004  and 2014. The need for physical therapists is particularly acute in rural and  urban underserved areas, which have  three  to  four  times  fewer physical  therapists per capita  than  suburban  areas. To address this need, the bill  also authorizes a distance education  pilot program  to  improve access  to  educational opportunity for both nursing and physical therapy students. Finally, the bill calls for a study by the  Institute of Medicine at the National  Academy of Sciences which will recommend how  to balance  education,  labor,  and  immigration  policies  to  meet the demand for qualified nurses  and physical therapists.  The provisions of the Nurse Faculty  and Physical Therapist Education Act  are  vital  to  overcoming workforce  challenges. By addressing nurse faculty  and physical therapist shortages, we  will enhance both access to care and  the quality of care.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1161  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.  folthe  (a) SHORTTITLE.—This Act may be cited as  the ‘‘Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist  Education Act of 2009’’.  (b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes  lowing findings:  (1) The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public  Law 107–205) has helped to support students  preparing to be nurse educators. Yet, nursing  schools nationwide are forced to deny admission to individuals seeking to become nurses  and nurse educators due to the lack of qualified nurse faculty.  (2) The American Association of Colleges  of Nursing reported that 42,866 qualified applicants were denied admission to nursing  baccalaureate and graduate programs in 2006,  with faculty shortages identified as a major  reason for turning away students.  (3) Seventy-one percent of schools have reported insufficient faculty as the primary  reason for not accepting qualified applicants.  The primary reasons for lack of faculty are  lack of funds to hire new faculty, inability to  identify, recruit and hire faculty in the competitive job market as of May 2007, and lack  of nursing faculty available in different geographic areas.  (4) Despite the fact that in 2006, 52.4 percent of graduates of doctoral nursing programs enter education roles, the 103 doctoral  programs nationwide produced only 437 graduates, which is only an additional 6 graduates from 2005. This annual graduation rate  is insufficient to meet the needs for nurse  faculty. In keeping with other professional  academic disciplines, nurse faculty at colleges  and  universities  are  typically  doctorally prepared.  (5) The nursing faculty workforce is aging  and will be retiring.  (6) With the average retirement age of  nurse faculty at 62.5 years of age, and the average age of doctorally prepared faculty, as  of May 2007, that hold the rank of professor,  associate professor, and assistant professor  is 58.6, 55.8, and 51.6 years, respectively, the  health  care  system  faces  unprecedented  workforce and health access challenges with  current and future shortages of deans, nurse  educators, and nurses.  (7) Research by the National League of  Nursing indicates that by 2019 approximately  75 percent of the nursing faculty population  (as of May 2007) is expected to retire.

Like many of  the  children of immigrants—Richard’s mother was  born in Italy and immigrated with her parents  in 1916 at six years old, and both his grandparents were immigrants from Italy as well—  his parents encouraged education, broadly defined, and a commitment to public service as  a way of ensuring more fairness in the Nation  they now called home. Richard was educated  at Fairfield University, where he received his  bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1962 and  at Boston College, where he  received his  master’s degree in mathematics in 1964. He  then joined the NSA.  His contribution to the Nation—he served at  NSA  for  thirty-five years;  its Director of Research from 1994 to 1999—was described by  the current Director of Research, Jim Schatz,  in these terms during the ceremony: Richard  was  ‘‘Universally  regarded as one of  the  Agency’s most visionary  thinkers. He  influenced NSA unmatched by anyone else in recent history  . . . Nearly  twenty years ago,  when large scale networking was still in its infancy, Richard anticipated  the emergence of  cyberspace as a battleground for national defense, and committed himself to ensuring NSA  was prepared. . . . [His] life was a celebration  of intellectual power dedicated to the service  of his country. He was an exemplary American  . . . NSA and the Nation owe him a debt of  gratitude.’’ Senator BARBARAMIKULSKI (Maryland), in her capacity as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, in a letter following Richard’s death, wrote that ‘‘By  any definition of the words, Mr. Proto was a  warfighter and a patriot. He set high standards  of performance at NSA and inspired others to  conform to his expectations. He dedicated his  life to the security of this Nation and has left  a contribution  that will endure  for decades.’’  During his career, Richard received the Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Service  and  the National  Intelligence Distinguished  Service Medal. Since his retirement in 1999,  he remained as an adviser to the intelligence  community, the national laboratories, and the  Institute  for Defense Analysis at Princeton,  until his death.  Richard’s  family was present and participated in the ceremony, including his brother,  Neil Proto, also a New Haven public school  graduate and now a  lawyer  in Washington,  D.C. and a professor of public policy at  Georgetown University, and his sister, Diana  Proto Avino, an educator and mathematics  consultant in the public school system in Clinton, Connecticut, and formerly a nationally-recognized teacher of the year. Richard had been  raised in New Haven among twenty-six cousins, four of whom made the journey from Connecticut. Richard was  truly a product of his  community and his Italian-American heritage.  He was a member of the famed 1958 Wilbur  Cross team that won the New England High  School basketball championship in the Boston  Garden that captured the soul of our community when  I was a  teenager. Mr. Proto also  was the founder of the Antonio Gatto Lodge of  the Sons of Italy in Laurel, Maryland.

The awards recognize extraordinary youth in  our community for their determination to overcome adversity and lead a full, productive life.  Beat the Odds Awards focus on young people who have come into contact with the juvenile justice system and, despite such an obstacle, have overcome abuse, neglect or juvenile delinquency with an earnest effort to realize a successful future.  It is my honor to commend the following individuals who have  risen above substantial  negative influences and are now being recognized as community success stories.  Recipients of the 2009 Beat the Odds Phoenix Award: Jessi Danner, Angela Garcia, Cynthia Hubler, Sha-Kina Jackson, and Maria Ann  Sisson.

801,146,2009-06-02,Mrs. MALONEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  honor Mr. Alexandros P. Mallias, the Ambassador of Greece to the United States. During  his tenure, Ambassador Mallias has fostered  greater  understanding  and  forged  closer  bonds between  the  leaders of Greece and  America, including with many members of the  House and Senate and officials in the Executive Branch. Ambassador Mallias has been a  truly outstanding representative of the Hellenic  Republic.  After nearly  four years  leading  the Greek  diplomatic delegation  to  the United States,  Ambassador Alexandros Mallias is returning to  serve as a senior advisor to the Greek Foreign  Minister, Dora Bakoyianni, on critical issues in  the sensitive Balkan region. Having first presented his credentials in Washington in 2005,  Ambassador Mallias has served with distinction during a critical period in Greek American  relations.  A proponent of public diplomacy, Ambassador Mallias has made hands-on interaction  with the American people an integral part of  his mission here, reaching beyond the bounds  of Beltway politics. He  traveled extensively  throughout  the U.S., visiting more  than 30  states and delivering more  than 140 public  lectures at universities, think tanks and other  organizations, not  just on  issues  relating  to  Greece, but also on matters affecting  the  broader Southeastern European region.  Born  on October  1,  1949, Ambassador  Mallias traces his family’s roots to Stemnitsa  in the mountainous region of Arcadia. He received his undergraduate degree in Economics from University of Athens, studied Political  Science at the University of Geneva, and obtained a Post-Graduate Certificate  from  the  ‘‘Institut des Hautes E´tudes Europe´ennes’’. He  joined the Foreign Service of the Hellenic Republic in 1976.  Ambassador Mallias developed a close and  warm relationship with the Hellenic American  Community.  He and his wife Franc¸oise, whom he affectionately calls his ‘‘pillar of support,’’ devoted  themselves  tirelessly and selflessly  to promoting  the  relationship between  the United  States and Greece. They opened the Greek  Embassy in Washington to events and cultural  occasions,  frequently  hosting  the Hellenic-  American community and the diplomatic community at large. I was honored to be included  at many of  these events and even, on one  special occasion, to be honored by the Greek  Embassy. It was a true highlight of my career,  the memory of which I will always treasure.  During  his  four  years  as Ambassador,  Alexandros P. Mallias worked to ensure that  the  critical  strategic  relationship  between  Greece and the United States remained on a  positive note. There is a fresh interest on the  part of the United States to work with Greece  on a wide array of issues of regional as well  as global importance, such as the security of  vital sea lanes.

803,153,2009-06-02,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  mark a significant victory  in my district  for  open space preservation in Pennsylvania and  the United States. Yesterday, an agreement  was finalized to permanently protect 426 acres  of  the  450-acre  Erdenheim  Farm  in  Whitemarsh and Springfield Townships.  The conservation of  this property will become the centerpiece of 2,000 acres of open  space between Fairmount Park in Philadelphia  and  Fort  Washington  State  Park  in  Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania. It will also ensure  the completion of a regional trail network between Fort Washington Park and  the Morris  Arboretum  that has been envisioned since  1899.  Erdenheim Farm has been working agricultural land since the days of William Penn. It  was purchased in 1912 by George D. Widener  Jr, son of  the streetcar magnate.  In 1971,  Widener bequeathed the property to his nephew, Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. Mr. Dixon maintained the property as a working farm raising  cattle, sheep, and  thoroughbred horses until  his death in 2006.  The preservation of Erdenheim Farm  is a  remarkable example of the excellent work that  can be accomplished  through public-private  partnerships leveraging local and state funds.  There are many organizations that deserve  recognition: the descendents of the Dixon Estate  for  their willingness  to work with conservationists  to protect  the  farm; Peter and  Bonnie McCausland, for purchasing 259 acres  of the estate and placing all but 23 of those  acres  under  conservation  easements;  the  Whitemarsh Foundation led by Hugh Moulton  for its efforts to acquire 189 acres using $26  million in state and local grants, tax revenue,  and private donations; the Natural Lands Trust  led by Molly Morrison, for its expertise in putting this deal together and enforcing the easements on  the  land; and state, county, and  local officials who also deserve immense credit for their willingness to secure the necessary  funding to make this happen.  I ask that the full House of Representatives  join me in congratulating everyone that made  this historic accomplishment possible. On behalf of the residents of Philadelphia and Montgomery Counties, I acknowledge and appreciate this important work and the opportunity it  provides  for  future generations  to enjoy  this  national treasure.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF RALPH  BLANTON  HON.

804,153,2009-06-02,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  the  life of  firefighter Ralph  Blanton of Tempe and to recognize the significant contributions he made to our community.  On May 11, 2009 Ralph passed away of  natural causes at the age of 79.  Ralph will be remembered for his active involvement in the development and growth of  Tempe’s first professional fire department. He  gained valuable experience in the 1950s as a  volunteer Tempe fireman, long before the formation of a paid fire department. In 1961, he,  along with 10 others, established the Tempe  Fire Department. Ralph earned the first ever  Fireman of  the Year award  in 1963  for his  dedication and work ethic. Finally, after 20  years of service, he was the last member of  the original force to retire.  In  addition  to Ralph’s  extensive  career  achievements, he was also known for his role  as a mentor. Many young firefighters looked  up to him and learned priceless lessons, chief  among them to take pride in one’s work. Together, he and his wife Shirley helped establish an annual picnic  for retired Tempe  firefighters, which the union plans to rename the  Ralph Blanton Retirees Picnic for Tempe firefighters in his honor.  Madam Speaker, please  join me  in commemorating the life of Ralph Blanton and remembering the strong and positive impact he  left on his community and  the many people  who knew and loved him.  f  HONORING MARY CRISALLI  SANSONE AND ZACHARY SANSONE  HON.

805,153,2009-06-02,Mr. MCMAHON.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to acknowledge, congratulate and celebrate the 93rd Birthday of a prominent Brooklyn community activist and civil  rights  trailblazer, Mary Crisalli Sansone and  the 93rd  Birthday of her beloved and devoted husband  of 60 years, Zachary Sansone.  Since her early days of union organizing  with her  father,  to her  involvement with  the  late Bayard Rustin of  the civil rights movement, Mary has fought for social justice and  human rights throughout her life.  Mary is the founder of three very influential  New York City organizations. Mary organized  the first coalition of African Americans, Latinos  and Italians in New York City in the 1960s to  promote racial harmony, which resulted in the  formation of an organization  comprised of  community leaders known as CURE, Community Understanding  for Racial  and Ethnic  Equality. CURE builds bridges between all racial, ethnic and religious groups  to promote  tolerance through education and cooperation.  In the 1970s, Mary founded CIAO, the Congress of Italian Americans Organization, which  has developed and continues to run many social service programs  to help  the poor and  needy. Mary is and has been a political godmother and angel to those in need.  Mary also is the founder of New Era Democrats (NED), an independent political association. NED  is a good government group  that  promotes and assists government leaders and  candidates for elected office who espouse the  utmost integrity and independence, regardless  of party affiliation.  Zachary Sansone was born  in Brooklyn,  New York and grew up in Naples, Italy. After  law school, he was  inducted  into  the  Italian  Army as a First Lieutenant.

807,3,2009-06-09,Mr. MCCLINTOCK.," Madam Speaker,  if the gentleman from Kentucky wants  to know why Republicans oppose the  government  takeover of our health  care system, I would invite him to consult the many, many refugees  from  Canada and Britain who have come  here to America to get their health  care, because they simply can’t survive  with bureaucrats  telling  them what  treatments they’ll get and when they’ll  get them.  The Republicans are proposing  to  bring within the reach of every American family a basic health plan that  they will own, that they can change if  it fails to suit them and that they will  hold wherever they work and under  whatever circumstances they work; but  Madam Speaker, I’m here on different  business this morning.  I’m here to talk about the right of  workers. Their right to gather and to  bargain collectively with an employer  is a fundamental right of labor. It often  strengthens the position of individual  workers as they negotiate with a powerful employer. Yet survey after survey  tells us that union members are less  satisfied with their jobs than nonunion  workers, and many Americans today  simply refuse to work in union shops at  all.  So why is it that a bargaining process designed to improve workers’ satisfaction  should  produce  such  dissatisfaction?  Perhaps the answer rests with the  simple human desire in each of us to  excel in what we do and to be recognized and rewarded for that excellence.  Collective  bargaining  increases  the  ability of workers to take a stronger  position  to negotiate with  an  employer, and this is good, but they’re  then left to give up any individual rewards for outstanding work.  Union workers end up trapped with a  one-size-fits-all  contract  that denies  them the dignity that comes from individual excellence and achievement. No  matter how hard that worker toils or  no matter how much he produces, he  gets paid exactly the same as the coal  worker who puts in minimal effort.  Well, why  shouldn’t workers  get  extra pay and performance bonuses beyond the union-negotiated wage base?  Why does the wage floor set through  union contracts also have to be a wage  ceiling for those union members who  go the extra mile to get ahead?  Union leaders may see value in wiping out individual initiative to build  solidarity among rank-and-file members, but those workers would be far  better off if they could enjoy both the  advantages  of  collective  bargaining  and  the additional  rewards of  individual performance raises and bonuses.  Many unionized businesses would gladly pay individual workers more if they  could. Some have tried, but over the  years, the National Labor Relations  Board  has  repeatedly  struck  them  down.  For that reason, I have introduced  the  Rewarding  Achievement  and  Incentivizing Successful Employees, or  RAISE Act, H.R. 2732. It will allow  working union members to escape the  false choice between collective bargaining and individual reward that our  outdated labor laws have forced upon  them. Senator VITTERhas introduced a  similar bill in the Senate.  Under the RAISE Act, union members would retain all of the collective  bargaining rights under current  law,  and employers would be bound to the  wage and benefit schedules negotiated  under those laws. In addition to the  floor established by the union contract,  employers could add bonuses for those  workers who go the extra mile, combining the benefits of collective bargaining with the rewards of individual  achievement.  Years ago, Admiral Grace Hopper observed that, in all of her years in the  United States Navy,  she had determined that the greatest impediment to  human progress  is  the phrase  ‘‘but  we’ve always done it this way.’’ That’s  the only answer we’ve heard so far in  opposition to this simple reform, and  in days like these, that’s no answer at  all.  f  CONGRATULATING MRS.

811,3,2009-06-09,Mr. BURTON  of  Indiana.," Madam  Speaker, Members of Congress in the  House and the Senate get  literature  sent to them every single day. In fact,  we probably get four or five books a  week. I don’t know how many little  leaflets and pamphlets we’re asked to  read, but we don’t have time to read  them all. We ask our staff to read some  of them, but we don’t have a chance to  really get into the minutiae of some of  these brochures.  Our colleagues in both the House and  the Senate  got  this  little  booklet  called ‘‘The State of the Union’s Finances, a Citizen’s Guide.’’ These are  going to be given, I guess, to people all  across this country. I hope every one of  my colleagues and everybody in America gets a chance to read this little  booklet. Now, this was sent to us by  our colleagues FRANKWOLF, Republican of Virginia, and JIM Democrat of Tennessee. I just want to  read to you a little bit about the situation that America faces, because Americans right now, I don’t think, are really aware of the fiscal problems we’re  facing.  As of the fall of 2008, we had $12.2 trillion in explicit liabilities. That’s publicly held debt, military and civilian  pensions, retiree health benefits, and  others things related to that. We had  $1.3 trillion in debt for Federal insurance, loan guaranties, leases, and so  forth, and we had a $42.9 trillion debt  from Medicare  hospital  insurance,  Medicare outpatient services, Medicare  prescription drugs, and Social Security. That’s a total of $56.4 trillion in  debt that we have right now, today.  That amounts to $184,000 of debt for  every man, woman, and child in this  country; it amounts to $435,000 of debt  for a full-time worker; for each household, it amounts to $483,000 in debt.  That’s the national debt today.  George Washington said we should  avoid ungenerously throwing upon posterity, our kids, the burden we, ourselves, ought to bear. In 1796, they had  a deficit, and George Washington said  that we can’t allow this to happen because we don’t want to leave a burden  to our kids and to our grandkids by  spending too much money.  I’m telling you right now, colleagues  and anybody else who is paying attention, what we’re going to  leave our  kids and our grandkids is something  that they will curse us  for because  they’re going to have to pay extremely  high taxes, and the inflationary problems that they’re going to  face are  going to be insurmountable.

812,10,2009-06-09,Mr. TEAGUE.," Mr. Speaker, over the  Memorial Day recess, our Nation lost  two individuals that I consider to be  national treasures. Two marines that  were known as ‘‘Navajo Code Talkers’’  passed away: John Brown, Jr., of Crystal, New Mexico, and his compatriot,  Thomas Claw. Both were 87.  During World War II, the Marines recruited members of the Navajo Nation  for the specific purpose of devising a  code that was based on the Navajo language. The Japanese were never able to  break the code, and the Code Talkers  were credited with helping save lives  and contributing to the military success in the Pacific theater.  The Code Talkers’ contributions were  invaluable, and we should always be  grateful for their service. They did so  much, and their contribution can be  summarized best by what John Brown  said when he was presented with the  Congressional Gold Medal:  ‘‘We have  seen much in our lives. We have seen  war and peace, and we know the value  of the freedom and democracy that this  great Nation embodies. But our experience also reminds us how fragile these  things can be and how vigilant we must  be in protecting them.’’  f  FISCAL RESTRAINT  (Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
813,10,2009-06-09,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, I hold  in my hand the voting card of the  United States Congress. Now, this is  the ultimate credit card. There’s no  limit and there’s no penalties. And it’s  wrong.  Every time I hear a solution from the  Democrats, it’s about spending more.  We have got to stop running this country on a credit card. The problems that  we face in this Nation, the challenges  that we face are not solved by charging  things on the credit card.  The American Dream is not about  overspending and being  in debt. It’s  about hard work and perseverance and  liberty. Every time we add dollars to  this card, we take away that liberty.  I urge my colleagues, come up with  solutions  that don’t  include an  increase  in  spending. Cap-and-trade  is  one of the largest tax increases in the  history of the United States of America.  Please, let’s stop running this government on a credit card. Institute fiscal restraint, and remember that it’s  the people’s money. It’s not the Congress’ money.  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",2009
814,10,2009-06-09,Ms. EDWARDS  of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, our current health care system is unsustainable. Working people  go every day without care or struggle  to pay increasingly higher premiums  and deductibles. In my home State of  Maryland, 76.7 percent of the uninsured  are from working families.  Now,  if a single-payer plan  is not  adopted by this Congress, which I support strongly, then we must have a robust public plan option like Medicare  to be enacted to reduce costs for small  businesses  and  individuals,  provide  true competition, and give patients the  choice they deserve. A public plan option has to be available to all without  exclusions.  It must  retain  patient  choice and  implement  reforms  that  promote quality care, prevention, primary care, and chronic health care  management. And importantly, a public plan option must address health  care  disparities  in underrepresented  communities.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress and President will be judged by our ability to  construct a health care system that  covers all Americans, lowers costs for  everyone, and provides real and competitive choice  for health care. The  time for reform is now, and we can’t  delay.  f  THE CRISIS IN HEALTH CARE  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
815,10,2009-06-09,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  it’s time we address the crisis in health  care. We can ensure every American  can get the care they need, protect individuals from costs that can bankrupt  them, and make health insurance portable so they can move or change jobs  without losing health insurance coverage. We can also stop insurance companies from avoiding sick patients by  reforming the system to pay when people become healthier.  Enacting a public plan will not bring  about this type of change. If you think  you won’t be affected by a public plan,  consider this: a recent analysis by the  respected independent firm The Lewin  Group estimated that 70 percent of individuals who have health care coverage through their employer would  lose those benefits in favor of a public  option. This plan could very easily be a  Medicaid-like plan.  In  fact, Senator  KENNEDY is proposing expanding Medicaid to families making up to $110,000  a year in legislation he dropped yesterday.  When supporters of a public plan say  they want a public plan to compete  with private plans, the facts show that  what they’re really saying is they want  a Washington bureaucrat to take over  health care decisionmaking.

816,10,2009-06-09,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr.  Speaker,  later  today the House will consider H. Res.  505, a bill that condemns the tragic  murder of Dr. George Tiller, and offers  our condolences to his wife, four children and 10 grandchildren.  He was known as a doctor of last resort and a friend to women when they  were in desperate need of support and  care. His murder in his church in Wichita, where he served as an usher and  where his wife sang in the choir, was a  violent, lawless and senseless act.  At his memorial service this past  Saturday, Dr. Tiller was remembered  for his generosity of spirit and his  sense of humor. Let us also remember  him for his courage.  Mahalo nui  loa  much).

817,10,2009-06-09,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, news came  yesterday that Laura Ling and Euna  Lee, two American journalists held in  North Korea,  and held  there  since  March, have been found guilty of illegally entering North Korea. They’ve  been  sentenced  to  12 years of hard  labor. These court proceedings were a  cruel joke, nothing more than a kangaroo court. I know of no justice system in North Korea. The two should be  immediately released.  As  if  there were any doubts,  the  North Korean regime has shown  its  true colors, a hostile regime bent on  destroying the lives of its own citizens  and others.  Let’s be clear. These two wouldn’t  have been near North Korea were it not  for the barbaric cruelty of its regime.  Ling and Lee were convicted of so-  called ‘‘grave crimes.’’ It is the North  Korean regime that commits real grave  crimes against millions of North Koreans every day.  President  Obama,  himself, must  make it clear that this action cannot  stand. Now is the time for urgent action.  f  OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009

819,17,2009-06-09,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H. Res. 505, which condemns the  tragic murder of Dr. George Tiller. The murder  of Dr. Tiller  is a  form of domestic  terrorism  that we cannot tolerate in our country.  I firmly agree with President Obama that we  can maintain our beliefs while agreeing to disagree. Dr. Tiller’s medical practice in Kansas  was operating legally, and we must abide by  the rule of law.  Mr. Speaker, I have personal knowledge of  the work of Dr. Tiller.  In 2000, my Subcommittee Staff Director, Jason Steinbaum,  and his wife, Miriam, were expecting a child.  This was their first baby, and they were very  excited about becoming new parents.  Through visit after visit to their doctor, they  learned  the pregnancy was proceeding well  and all seemed normal. The sonograms were  all as  they should have been, until calamity  struck. At 28 weeks the doctors discovered a  horrible brain deformity. They said  the baby  would die in utero or shortly after birth.  I recall  that Jason and Miriam went  from  doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital to try  to find a way to save their baby boy, but all  told them that there was no chance that he  would live. At that point, after consulting with  their clergy, their doctors, and their families,  they decided to terminate the pregnancy to put  an end to this tragedy in their lives.  At 28 weeks, however, extremely few physicians in the country would provide the medical  care  they  needed.  Dr.  Tiller  was  recommended to them as the best physician to  help them.  I recall that I could not believe they had to  fly to Wichita, Kansas to get the medical care  they required. As a member of Congress from  New York, I have become accustomed to receiving the best health care in New York City  and could not imagine that they would have to  travel half way across the country because no  such clinic existed nearby. Nevertheless, when  they determined that there was no other place  to which they could turn, Jason, Miriam, and  their mothers  flew  to Kansas  to Women’s  Health Care Services of Wichita and Dr. Tiller.  Jason has  told me  that  the care  they received at Dr. Tiller’s clinic was extraordinary  and that the people at the clinic treated them  as well as they could imagine. The procedure  was safe and humane, and at the end, they  held  their baby boy  for a moment and said  goodbye. Today,  the baby  is buried not  far  from their home in north Virginia.  So, as the House votes on this solemn resolution, I ask that my colleagues reflect for a  moment on  the  fact  that Dr. Tiller helped  someone right here in our congressional community and  that his murderer  took someone  who was there for one of us in a time of need.  This is a terribly sad day, and I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 505.  Mr. NADLER  of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.  ",2009

The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 515  Whereas, on June 1, 2009, Private William  Long, 23, was murdered outside the Army  Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas;  Whereas, on June 1, 2009, Private Quinton  Ezeagwula, 18, was wounded by gunfire outside the Army Navy Career Center in Little  Rock, Arkansas;  Whereas there are more than 1,400,000 active component and more than 1,200,000 reserve component members of  the Armed  Forces protecting America;  Whereas there are more than 8,000 Army  and Army Reserve recruiters and more than  7,000 Navy recruiters serving at more than  1,500 military recruiting stations and centers  in United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and  Europe;  Whereas the men and women of the Armed  Forces risk their lives every day to preserve  America’s freedom and to defend the liberty,  security,  and  prosperity  enjoyed  by  the  American people;  Whereas service in the Armed Forces entails special hazards and demands extraordinary sacrifices from service members;  Whereas members of the Armed Forces are  the targets of violence not only abroad but  in the United States as well; and  Whereas such violence is despicable and  must not be tolerated: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) offers its condolences to the family of  Private William Long;  (2) hopes for a full recovery for Private  Quinton Ezeagwula;  (3) urges swift prosecution to the fullest  extent of the law of the perpetrator of this  senseless shooting; and  (4) urges the American people to join Congress in condemning acts of violence.

Mr.  Speaker, I now yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 515  rightly condemns the murder of Army  Private William Long and the wounding  of  Army  Private  Quinton  Ezeagwula, who were shot outside the  Army Navy Career Center  in Little  Rock, Arkansas, on June 1, 2009.  This dastardly attack on two young  Americans who were simply standing  outside the Armed Forces Recruiting  Center where  they worked  should  shock the conscience of all Americans.  Private Long, who was 23, was murdered. Private Ezeagwula, who is 18,  was wounded. They had answered their  call to service and were willing to lay  down their lives for their country, but  the deadly attack came here at home,  not on a field of battle halfway across  the world.  There are more than 1.4 million Active members of the Armed Forces protecting America, and more than 1.2  million Reserve members. There are  more than 8,000 Army and Army Reserve recruiters, and more than 7,000  Navy recruiters, serving at more than  1,500 military recruiting stations and  centers in the United States, Puerto  Rico, Guam, and Europe. Each one of  these men and women are courageous  patriots who deserve our support, and  this deadly attack is nothing short of  dastardly.  This  resolution  offers  the  condolences of this House to the family of  Private Long, expresses our hopes for a  full recovery  for Private Ezeagwula,  and urges that the perpetrator or perpetrators of this senseless shooting be  brought to justice.  b1415  I want to commend our colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr.  FRANKS), for introducing this resolution. It is an appropriate statement of  what I note to be the views of every  Member of this House. At a time like  this, it is important for all of us to  stand together to support our men and  women in uniform and to speak with  one  voice  against  violence  directed  against them.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
830,24,2009-06-09,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, on June 1 of 2009, only  about a week ago, Private William  Long, only 23 years old, was shot and  killed as he worked at the Army Navy  Career Center, which is a military recruitment center, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Private Quinton I. Ezeagwula,  age 18, was also shot in the attack that  day. Thankfully, Private Ezeagwula  survived; although our latest information is that he remains still in critical  condition.  Mr. Speaker, most persons who are  listening today are hearing about Private Long’s death for the first time.  It’s  likely  that  most  Americans  haven’t heard of his killing because  Private Long’s murder forces the issue  that the mainstream media does not  want to confront or report on, and that  is Islamic terrorism within and coming  from within the United States.  The man accused of shooting Private  Long and Private Ezeagwula was formally  known  as  Carlos  Bledsoe.  Bledsoe  converted  to  Islam  and  changed  his  name  to Abdulhakim  Mujahid Muhammad. He later traveled  to Yemen where he was there studying  under an  Islamic  scholar. Yes, Mr.  Speaker, we have millions of law-abiding Muslims in this country. Acts of  terror committed by some members of  a religion should never be used to condemn all members of that religion. At  the same time, however, we cannot be  blind to the jihadist ideology of some  Muslims of this country who believe  that they have a religious duty to murder the innocent.  The mindset of radical Islamic terrorism which today seems to find fertile ground in the soil of jihad claims  that the cause of justice is advanced by  killing  the  innocent and by killing  those who seek to protect the innocent.  This is the fundamental reality. And  when the American media and we, as a  people, refuse to call evil by its name,  it imperils us all and it dishonors all of  those, like these two soldiers who have  sacrificed and bled to protect the innocent from that evil.

833,31,2009-06-09,Mr. TONKO.," I yield myself such time  as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the  substantial  contributions  that  AmeriCorps has made towards national  and community service.  AmeriCorps began in 1994 as an effort  to engage Americans in the ethic of  service and volunteerism. The organization  launched  following the establishment of the Corporation  for National and Community Service under  the National and Community Service  Trust Act. The initial class of 20,000  volunteers established an  immediate  tradition  of  assisting  communities  across the country. This tradition involves improving the lives of the Nation’s most vulnerable citizens, protecting the environment, contributing  to public safety, responding to disasters,  and  strengthening  our  educational system.  We recognize the real  impact that  AmeriCorps has and continues to have  on our Nation’s communities. Since  1994, more than 570,000 individuals have  served with the organization. These individuals have tackled some of the Nation’s toughest issues, including illiteracy,  gang  violence,  homelessness,  and drug abuse. They have worked with  thousands  of  organizations  ranging  from Habitat for Humanity to the Red  Cross. After  their  terms of  service,  these members remain engaged in their  communities as volunteers, as teachers, and as nonprofit professionals at  disproportionately high levels.  In my district, in the capital region  of New York State, we have a large  AmeriCorps program with the Self Advocacy Association of New York. The  AmeriCorps members, all with developmental disabilities, travel around the  State, giving presentations—promoting  the  importance of  self-advocacy  for  people with disabilities,  the general  awareness of disability-related  issues  and the importance of full community  inclusion of people with disabilities.  This is important work, and I am so  pleased we have these volunteers back  home in my congressional district. We  realize that, as this current economic  downturn puts millions of Americans  at risk, the need for volunteers and national service will be more important  than ever.  The recently signed Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act expands the  AmeriCorps  program  to  incorporate  some 250,000 volunteers each year. It is  important to recognize the commitment of these volunteers so that future  generations will continue to support  the  ideal  of  national  service. The  strength of our Nation depends upon  SUI individuals who take action towards  building better communities.  We observed AmeriCorps Week May 9  through May 16. AmeriCorps Week provides current volunteers, alums, grantees, program partners, and friends with  the opportunity to highlight the important work done by this great organization. It is a chance for us to thank  those individuals whose service to society cannot be fully measured.  It is also a wonderful opportunity for  us to motivate future individuals to  pursue the ethic of service, whether in  organizations such as AmeriCorps or in  the various other service opportunities  that exist in our Nation. The ethic of  service is a manifestation of the greater ideal of democracy. The AmeriCorps  pledge begins: ‘‘I will get things done  for America to make our people safer,  smarter, and healthier.’’ It is important that we recognize that service is a  civic duty. Not only do we express  gratitude for service, but we express  gratitude through service. When we acknowledge the significant accomplishments of AmeriCorps as an organization, we affirm the importance of service as a necessary component of any  democracy.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to  take a moment to appreciate the contributions made by AmeriCorps. These  volunteers are the muscle of America,  and they deserve this recognition.  I want to thank Representative MATfor bringing this resolution to the  floor, and I urge my colleagues to pass  this resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
834,31,2009-06-09,Mr. PLATTS.,"  I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 453, a resolution  recognizing AmeriCorps Week observed  last month on May 9 through May 16.  AmeriCorps recognizes the  individuals who have chosen to participate in  the AmeriCorps  program,  and  they  have dedicated a significant amount of  time helping others in local communities.  In  1990, President George Herbert  Walker Bush signed the National Service Act, a network of national service  programs that engage Americans in intensive service to meet the Nation’s  vital needs in education, public safety,  health, and the environment.  In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed  the National Community Service Trust  Act, which established the Corporation  for National and Community Service,  which brought the full range of domestic community service programs under  the umbrella of one central organization.  Finally, just a few months ago, President Obama signed the latest reauthorization of the Corporation for National  and Community Service, a bill that  was developed and passed in a strong  bipartisan fashion in both Chambers.  This legislation builds on the reforms  to the corporation, started by the previous administration, to ensure additional accountability in national service programs. This most recent legislation will also help smaller organizations participate in national service,  and  it will ensure  that  the unique  skills of America’s veterans are well-  utilized.  AmeriCorps offers 75,000 opportunities for adults of all ages and backgrounds to address a myriad of needs in  communities all across America, such  as tutoring and mentoring disadvantaged youth, fighting illiteracy, building affordable housing, and assisting  communities in times of natural disaster. For example, in the last 3 years,  more than 4 million service hours have  been spent helping gulf coast communities recover and rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That’s 4 million hours of service made possible by  the organizations and by the individuals who chose to participate in the  AmeriCorps programs.  This resolution recognizes one week  where we salute current and  former  AmeriCorps members for their important work. It also allows us to thank  all community partners who make it  possible  for AmeriCorps members to  serve.  I want to take this opportunity to  thank my fellow cochairs on the National Service Caucus, Representatives  MATSUI, EHLERSand PRICE, for introducing this resolution. I ask my colleagues to support it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

837,31,2009-06-09,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," I thank my  colleague of Pennsylvania for yielding  me some time.  Mr. Speaker,  this bill  encourages  Americans  to  support  AmeriCorps.  There are some around the country  who would agree with that. There are  others who would not because there are  problems with AmeriCorps,  such as  moneys that have been expended on  ACORN. Other  funds and efforts by  AmeriCorps volunteers have been utilized in campaigns, which I don’t think  is quite appropriate, particularly when  we’re trying to promote volunteerism.  Whether  people  would  support  AmeriCorps or not, I think that there  is another issue that, if the American  people were to fully comprehend and  understand, the vast majority of this  country would not support. It’s what  the liberals in this Congress are calling  cap-and-trade legislation. I call it tax-  and-cap legislation because that’s what  it’s all about. It’s about taxes. In fact,  the President recently said, if this bill  were not passed, he would not have the  money to fund his socialized medicine  program for which he is actually pushing very hard and for which he wants  passed by the end of this year.

The  bill has  the  support  of  the  Obama administration, the UAW, domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and dealers.  b1615  It also will result in meaningful reductions in vehicle fleet carbon emissions and fuel consumption while providing much-needed stimulus to our  ailing automakers and economy.  I express my deep gratitude to Chairman WAXMAN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. STUPAK, as well as Representatives SUTTON, ISRAELand INSLEE, for their collaborate, collegial approach during the  negotiations on the legislation. And I  want  to  commend my  friend, Mr.  UPTON, and others of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle as well as the  entire Michigan delegation, for their  work on behalf of this.  This  legislation  cannot wait. The  longer it is put off, the more auto sales  will be depressed. And consumers who  are excited about this proposal will  continue to wait for Congress to pass  this bill before buying that new car  that we want them to have.  In view of the unprecedented turmoil  faced by the domestic automakers and  growing imperatives to address global  warming, Ms.  fleet modernization bill stands out as a really  practical mechanism  by  which  to  achieve consumer savings, reduce fuel  consumption, lower carbon dioxide and  criteria pollutant emissions, as well as  increase sales for a critical sector of  the national economy. Indeed, in countries  such  as Germany,  fleet modernization programs have been wildly  successful in all of these areas.  This is a good bill. It will help us  with the environment, and it will help  us with employment. It will see to it  that the United States moves forward  rapidly towards a full and adequate recovery from this terrible recession in  which we find ourselves.  I urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I commend its author again.  ",2009

842,45,2009-06-09,Mr. ROGERS  of Alabama.,"  I  rise  today to offer my reluctant support of  the Consumer Assistance to Recycle  and Save Act, also known as the Cash  for Clunkers program.  All of us have witnessed the devastation felt by our automotive sector. In  my home State of Alabama, as in many  other States, workers have lost their  jobs or had their hours cut. Many hardworking  dealers  have  simply  been  forced to close their doors.  To help protect our jobs and stimulate the automotive sector, we must  work  to  stimulate  consumer  credit  markets and  restore  consumer  confidence. That is why I recently introduced my bill, the Consumer Auto Relief Act. Unlike the bill we are considering today, my proposal would help all  sectors of the automotive industry.  In addition to offering tax credits to  working families to help purchase new  vehicles,  the  bill would  also  help  incentivize lenders to finance new vehicles. The bill would also place no limitations on eligibility to participate in  the program. Unfortunately, my bill is  not what is on the floor today. Nonetheless, despite my reservations about  H.R. 2751, I believe that passing it is  better than doing nothing, but not by  much. I offer my support for the bill  and urge its passage.  ",2009

844,45,2009-06-09,Ms. PELOSI.," I thank the gentlelady  for yielding. I commend her for her tremendous leadership in putting together  this legislation that we have before us.  She, Representative ISRAEL and Representative  all worked  very  hard to come to a position that we can  all support today. Mr. MARKEY is here  of the Select Committee, and of course  Mr. DINGELL, the Chair Emeritus of the  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee.  Others, Mr. BRALEY, Mr. STUPAK—well,  all of our colleagues have had an important role—Mr. KILDEEand our colleagues on the Republican side of the  aisle. Hopefully we will have a good,  strong bipartisan vote today on this  legislation.  Because you all have given us an opportunity to pass legislation that is a  benefit to our economy and a benefit to  our environment, we can create and  save jobs while addressing the air pollution issue, so important to our children’s health. We will do this by allowing Americans to trade in their own  gas-guzzling  vehicles  and  receive  vouchers worth up to $4,500 to help pay  for the new, more fuel-efficient cars  and trucks.  I will go into some specifics—I know  we’ve heard it over and over again, but  this CARS bill is quite a remarkable  piece of legislation, and the timing is  perfect. And when they trade in these  cars, they will strengthen America’s  auto industry, creating jobs and reducing layoffs, and save more than 250 million gallons of gas. This has been tried  and true around the world in recent  months with great  success.  In Germany,  for example,  it boosted auto  sales by 20 percent.  Because this legislation will deliver  consumer savings, increase vehicle demand, help save American jobs while  cutting greenhouse gas emissions and  reducing our dependence on foreign oil,  it is supported by a broad coalition.  That coalition includes the Big Three  automakers, the United Auto Workers,  car dealers, business groups such as the  National Association of Manufacturers,  the Chamber of Commerce, and, in the  lead, the Obama administration.  Today, with this legislation, we will  ensure a  strong American manufacturing base. As much as anything that  we can do in terms of addressing the  issue of the auto industry in our country, this is a national security issue.  The auto industry’s success is essential  to ensuring that we have a strong manufacturing base. This legislation today  will ensure that we have a strong manufacturing base and get more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road, which is essential to our economy, to our national  security, and a clean, green future.  I commend my colleagues once again.  I commend Congresswoman SUTTON for  her determination  to accelerate  the  pace of when we would bring this legislation to the floor and urge strong bipartisan support for the bill, which it  certainly deserves.

Madam Speaker, this bill is a bad  idea spawned by a bad idea that was  spawned by still yet another bad idea—  and it will likely spawn a lot of other  bad ideas in the future.  The first bad idea was to bail out the  auto industry in the first place. The  second bad idea was for the government to essentially take over the auto  industries. We all know that government  is not very good at manufacturing anything, so it has to manufacture demand. And that’s what this bill  is about. It is defying the laws of economics and saying we can manufacture  enough demand to keep the auto industries afloat without other measures  that they need to take to stay afloat.  We can’t simply manufacture demand  any more than we can defy any of the  other laws of economics.  A list was given of those who support  this legislation. It says it has broad  support from Ford, GM, Chrysler, the  Automobile Dealers Association,  the  labor unions,  the Chamber of Commerce.

852,52,2009-06-09,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Madam Speaker, it is hard to  believe that it was 25 years ago that  this Congress worked to facilitate the  establishment of the National Center  for Missing and Exploited Children.  I recall being on the subcommittee of  the Judiciary Committee when John  Walsh and his wife testified before us.  It was at a time when they did not  know who had murdered their child.  It was at a time  in this country  where we specifically prohibited the  use of the FBI in attempting to participate in any activities to try and find  missing children. We had a statutory  delay for any participation by the FBI.  There was a lack of coordination that  was not only in existence, but was promoted by law at that time.  And I recall, after John Walsh and  his wife testified before us, the shrugging of shoulders by some who basically had to tell the Walshes that there  was nothing that we could do here on  the Federal level.  John Walsh and his wife did not take  that as an answer. They spoke to many  of us here in the Chamber, but actually  those of us on the subcommittee and  committee at  that  time, and  challenged us to try and find a way to  make it possible that we could have a  seamless web between the Federal Government,  the State government and  local government when the question  was a missing child. And the strength  and persistence of that couple, combined with others who  joined  them  around the country was extraordinary  at that time.  It seems so commonplace now for us  to talk about the 25th anniversary of  the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children. It seems so commonplace for us to talk about hundreds  of thousands of children being reported  missing yearly, and the fact that there  was almost a collective shrug of the  shoulder at that time saying, it is a  terrible tragedy, but there’s nothing  we can do about it.  It seems so commonplace now that  when a child is missing, with all of the  various laws that have followed after  the creation of the National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children, that  almost instantaneously you have law  enforcement across the board communicating with one another and creating  a mechanism by which there can be the  exchange of information and the encouragement of the exchange of information so that we can find these children.  One thing we knew 25 years ago, and  it remains the same today, the sooner  you know that a child is missing, the  better the chances are of being able to  find that child. The sooner you have  law enforcement involved, along with  the  communities,  the  better  the  chances are that you will have a successful recovery of that child and a  successful reuniting of that family.  So I hope people understand why we  celebrate the 25th anniversary of the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and that it has been  the result of thousands upon thousands  of people working for this effort.  Had it not been for a single couple,  the Walshes, who, out of tragedy, decided to make something positive, had  it not been for them coming here to the  Congress and insisting that we look at  this issue and insisting that there was  something that can be done and insisting that just because we used to do it  the old way was no reason or no excuse  for not trying to do something different, had it not been for them, we  would not be celebrating the 25th anniversary, nor would we be celebrating  the thousands upon thousands of successful  reunitings  that  have  taken  place around this country.  So this is a wonderful recognition of  the center, but I hope it will also be a  tremendous  recognition of  the  contributions made  by  two wonderful  Americans, the Walshes.  ",2009

854,52,2009-06-09,Mr. PLATTS.," Madam Speaker,  I,  again, urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote in support of  this  important  resolution and  commend Mr. POE for his sponsorship, as  well as Mr. LUNGREN for his important  work in the foundation of the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  House Resolution 454, recognizing  the 25th  anniversary of the National Center for Missing  and Exploited Children.  In 1979, while on his way to school, 6-year-  old Etan Patz disappeared from the streets of  New York City.  In 1981, 6-year-old Adam  Walsh disappeared  from a Florida shopping  mall. The media attention and search efforts  that resulted  from  these  two cases  focused  the nation’s attention on the problem of child  abduction and the need for a coordinated effort to address this problem.  The National Center  for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, as it is called in acronym, was created by Congress  in 1984,  through the Missing Children’s Assistance Act.  NCMEC works  in partnership with  the U.S.  Department of Justice and is the nation’s resource center and clearinghouse for information on missing and exploited children. Since  1984, NCMEC has assisted law enforcement  with more than 154,000 missing child cases,  resulting in the recovery of more than 138,000  children.  NCMEC’s mission includes helping to prevent child abduction and sexual exploitation;  helping to find missing children; and assisting  victims of child abduction and sexual exploitation,  their  families, and  the professionals  who serve them. NCMEC provides assistance  to families and law enforcement agencies in  locating and recovering missing and exploited  children, both nationally and internationally.  NCMEC offers many services,  including a  24-hour call center. NCMEC’s toll-free national  hotline, 1-800-THE-LOST, has handled more  than 2.3 million calls.  NCMEC also manages a distribution system  for missing-child photos; a system of case  management and technical assistance for law  enforcement and  families;  training programs  for Federal, State and local law enforcement;  and programs designed to help stop the sexual exploitation of children.  NCMEC is the only private, non-profit organization that combines these resources to provide support to law enforcement, state clearinghouses, and parents working to find missing children.  I stand in support of this resolution recognizing  the 25th Anniversary of  the National  Center  for Missing and Exploited Children.  I  ask for my colleagues’ support.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009
855,52,2009-06-09,Mr. TONKO.," Madam Speaker,  the  resolution before the House, H. Res.  454, recognizing the 25th Anniversary  of the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children, is one that obviously  brings with  it many  happy  endings for at least 138,000 families.  And while not all of the stories are  those happy endings, the center has  provided itself as a resource, as a network that has devoted itself to the reconnection of our youth to their families. And  so, with  that outstanding  record and with the concerns for missing children still alive and haunting us  as a society, I strongly encourage a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on the resolution.

862,59,2009-06-09,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. LARSEN) for yielding me time, and  I also want to commend him for his  leadership on this important issue.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 410, a resolution I introduced  with my friend from South Carolina,  the Honorable HENRY BROWN, along  with the distinguished co-Chairs of the  Congressional  Boating  Caucus,  the  Honorable GENE from Mississippi and  the Honorable CANDICE  MILLERfrom Michigan.  Our resolution highlights the important contributions of the recreational  boating community and the boating industry as to the quality of our lives  and as to our continued economic prosperity. I urge President Obama to issue  a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe July 1 as National Boating Day.  Boating is a famous symbol for south  Florida, where I come from, and for  other parts around the country. Millions of residents  in our community  and  tourists  take  to  the waters of  south Florida to boat, to fish, to dive,  to snorkel, and to view scenic tours  along our pristine coastline and along  our  unique  intercoastal  waterway.  Palm Beach County alone has over  40,000 registered boaters. Fort Lauderdale’s majestic canals have earned it  the nickname  ‘‘the Venice of America.’’  The significance of the boating community is not only symbolic. The industry is a major economic engine in  Florida, responsible for over $2.8 billion  in direct sales and for 30,000 jobs State-  wide. In my district alone, there are  over 34,000 registered boats. The industry produces $193 million, and it employs over 2,000 of my constituents.  As everyone here knows, the contributions of the boating community  extend far beyond the Sunshine State.  The boating community  includes  59  million people and 13.6 million registered boats throughout the United  States.  In addition, the recreational  boating industry provides more than  $37 billion in sales and in services to  the U.S. economy, and it provides over  300,000 jobs throughout our country.  One need only look at the geographic  diversity among members of the Congressional Boating Caucus, of which I  am a proud member, to measure the  broad  influence and contributions of  the boating  community and of  the  boating industry. Members come from  33 States, including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and West Virginia.  Clearly, boating is not just a coastal  pastime. It  is an American pastime.  Boating also brings us closer to our  natural  resources  and  treasures.  I  strongly believe that an appreciation  for environmental stewardship comes  through an  interaction with nature.  For example, it’s hard to comprehend  the beauty of our coral reefs until you  see it under water with your own eyes  through a boat. Once you do, you begin  to understand their importance and the  need to protect them for the continued  health of our oceans.  Boating gives us these cherished opportunities to commune with nature,  and it should be no surprise that boaters can be impassioned stewards of the  environment, teaching future generations of boaters to have a healthy respect and appreciation for our natural  resources.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker,  I  urge my colleagues to support H. Res.  410, and I thank the gentleman from  Washington again for bringing H. Res.  410 to the floor.  I urge its passage.  ",2009
863,59,2009-06-09,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield such  time as he may consume to our colleague  from  Indiana, Representative  SOUDER.  ",2009
864,59,2009-06-09,Mr. SOUDER.," I thank my friend and  colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership on Transportation and for the  time to speak on this bill.  As a member of the Boating Caucus,  since we first formed this, I am really  pleased to be supportive of this resolution. In northeast Indiana, basically, I  represent a lot of water with plants  and farms in between.  In Kosciusko County, we have 100  lakes. In Steuben County, we have 100  lakes. Along this ridge, one water system heads  towards Lake Erie; one  water  system  heads  towards Lake  Michigan, and the other goes down into  the Mississippi Valley. Because of geological potholes basically connected together, sometimes through small dams  and sometimes in natural larger lakes,  we have the bulk of the lakes in Indiana.  It  is when  the glaciers pulled  back. So in this zone, I would guess we  may have 40 to 60 percent of the natural  lakes  in the State of  Indiana.  Some have been, historically in United  States’ history, big attractions, not  necessarily as big a tourist attraction  as in Florida or as in Wisconsin or, for  that matter, as in Washington State,  but Winona Lake was a big Chautauqua  area.  In Kosciusko County, we have a number of State parks on these lakes, and  so we’re proud to bring in lots of regional tourism and people who enjoy  them. They’re sometimes lined up to  get to the open space on our lakes in  Indiana.  Yet, as the number one manufacturing district in the United States—I  can’t remember the  latest  figures—I  believe we’re  fifth  in  the manufacturing of boats. Many of those boats go  JOE down to Florida and to the coasts. The  inboard-outboard engine and the jet engine were both invented in my district,  working with Volvo in Sweden. Many  of the larger boat companies are based  there—everything from float boats to  fishing boats to high-powered speedboats. It is a critical part of our district. It has been a pleasure to work  with the boating industry as we work  on how to get retail floor plan financing for boats.  We hear a lot right now about GM  and Chrysler—the auto companies.  I  represent Elkhart County, along with  Congressman  DONNELLY. We’ve  been working to make sure of the RV  industry, 58 percent of which is there;  but if you’ll notice and look carefully  at the retail floor plan financing and at  SBA and at what they’ve done through  TALF and other things, you’ll see it  says cars, trucks, RVs, motorcycles,  and boats, because the same challenge  that we’re facing in the auto industry  is true for the boating industry, which  is how do we make sure there are adequate boats being purchased from manufacturers; how do we make sure there  is the financing to keep them afloat,  and then how do we make sure of the  dealers. If they can only get one-fourth  of their normal inventory there, here  in this peak season for selling boats, it  isn’t going to work.  So this is a very unusual time and an  important time for the boating industry. Not only are we entering the summer season in the Great Lakes region  and in other areas of the country where  boating and recreation are at a peak,  but it’s also a time of survival. It is  probably the biggest challenge to the  boat manufacturers since the  luxury  tax nearly sunk them years ago.  So I stand, honored to speak on behalf of this resolution because it’s very  important that we call to the attention  of the American people not only the  great pleasures of recreational boating  but also the importance of having our  boating industry survive.

As the chairwoman of the Committee  on Homeland Security Subcommittee  for Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism,  I have been  fortunate  enough  to  visit  the  border  several  times to see firsthand the good work of  the Border Patrol. I have seen it, not  just on the southern border with Mexico, but also that with Canada.  These dedicated men and women patrol America’s borders, often in harsh  climates, in isolated conditions, under  dangerous conditions, in order to keep  our Nation secure.  Representatives of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol, and  its agents have also testified many,  many  times  before  our  committee  about the challenges they  face, particularly  the Border Patrol’s  rapid  growth and its evolving mission in recent years.  I don’t know if a lot of you remember, but just a few years back, our Border Patrol was only 450 people. Today  it numbers almost 19,000, and it’s on  track to grow to 20,000 agents by the  end of next year.  When it was founded, the Border Patrol’s sole mission was to prevent persons and contraband from entering our  country illegally. But, in particular, in  the wake of the attacks of September  11 of 2001, the Border Patrol is also  charged, it is our front line, with stopping terrorists and their weapons from  entering our country.  In the early days of the Border Patrol, agents patrolled our borders without the benefit of modern technology.  But today they have sensors, cameras,  in addition to their traditional ‘‘sign-  cutting’’ or their tracking skills, which  they still use in some of the mountainous areas, especially out there in  the Arizona and California desert. And  through all these changes, the Border  Patrol and its agents have maintained  a steadfast commitment to serving our  Nation.  I commend the Border Patrol and all  the agents who have served honorably  under the Patrol’s proud 85-year history. It is certainly fitting that the  House of Representatives is marking  this anniversary today with this resolution.  And finally, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. TEAGUE, the gentleman from  New Mexico, for offering this fine resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues  to give it their support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

Resolution 498,  celebrating the anniversary of the Border Patrol and honoring their service.  The Border Patrol was established in  the Immigration Act of 1924, and celebrated  its  85th anniversary  just  recently on May 28, 2009.  The Border Patrol is one of the most  public  faces  of  the Department  of  Homeland Security. For  those who  aren’t  familiar with the differences,  the Border Patrol covers the areas between the ports of entry as opposed to  the ports of entry. The 18,000 men and  women in green work every day along  the  borders  and  coastlines  of  the  United States, often  in some of the  most rugged and challenging terrain.  I have this outsized map here that  the Marfa sector of the Border Patrol  had given me from Texas. And this is  just one small section of the border,  but I wanted to use it to illustrate a  few points. Marfa, Texas, is one of the  more,  let’s  just  say,  rural parts of  America, which is why it was featured  in ‘‘No Country for Old Men,’’ ‘‘There  Will Be Blood,’’ because it was such a  kind of an undeveloped area.

873,80,2009-06-09,Mr. ALTMIRE., Ms. BALDWINhas joined us as well.  I’m glad to yield the floor to Mr.  thank  the  genALTMIRE.  ,2009
874,80,2009-06-09,Mr. ALTMIRE.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  I cannot think of a bigger issue to be  dealing with right now. We have so  many issues that this Congress is dealing with. Certainly energy, education,  this enormous mountain of debt which  we have accumulated over the years,  all of these issues are critically important, and all of them are issues that  this Congress is going to deal with. The  issue of health care is an issue that impacts our national debt. We cannot dig  our way out of this hole. We cannot  achieve structural surplus like we had  in the 1990s. We can’t ever even approach that until we deal with the skyrocketing cost of health care.  This is an issue that affects every  American in this country very directly.  It affects every family and it affects  every small business in the country in  ways that other issues that we deal  with don’t on a daily basis.  So what we are talking about here  tonight  and what  this Congress  is  doing over the course of this summer  as we put together this health care reform bill is the three legs of the stool,  as the gentleman pointed out, making  sure  that we  find a way  for every  American in this country to gain access to our system and get affordable  health care, making sure that we bring  down the costs for everyone. Because  we talk about the 47 million Americans  who don’t have any health insurance  right now. They get treated. They show  up at the emergency room, and they  get their health care. It’s certainly not  the most cost-effective way. It’s probably not the most efficient way, and  it’s probably not the best way for them  to get health care, but they’ll end up in  the system somewhere. And as the gentleman knows, those of us who have insurance pay for them. They get covered. They get their treatment. But the  cost shift that takes place is the reason  why an aspirin costs $10 when you go to  the hospital.  It’s very easy  to demagogue  this  issue if you’re in it for political reasons, to say, well, here’s what they  want to do: They want to take your  money and give it to those people who  don’t have health insurance because 87  percent of Americans in this country  have health care. We spend a lot of  time talking about those who don’t,  but  87  percent  of Americans  have  health care. Now, they are in many  cases one illness or injury away from  losing everything, certainly one  job  loss away, and  tens of millions of  Americans that have coverage live in  fear of losing it for those very reasons.  Tens  of millions more  are  underinsured. They have  some  coverage;  they don’t have what they need. And in  many cases, the insurance companies  have people, millions, approximately 2  million people, that are employed in  this country specifically to find a way,  if you are insured, to make sure that  they can deny your claim, to redline  you, to find a preexisting condition exclusion,  to  find a  reason why  they  shouldn’t have to pay your claim. Now,  that’s another of the issues. Lastly is  quality. So you have cost, you have access, and you have quality.  We have  in many ways  the best  health care system anywhere  in the  world, and the challenge that we have  in putting this bill together is we want  to preserve what works. We want to  say to the 87 percent of Americans who  have health care, if you like your plan,  if you enjoy the health care plan that  you have and you want to keep  it,  we’re not going to touch it and you can  keep it. But if you want another alternative, we’re going to find you another  alternative. And if you have too much  out-of-pocket costs, you’re not satisfied with the situation that you have,  we’re going to give you another alternative. But we want to preserve what  works in the current system. We want  those who have health care to be able  to keep it. And we want to make sure  that our medical innovation, our technology, our research, which far exceeds  anything available anywhere else  in  the world, is preserved. We want to fix  what doesn’t work and we want to preserve what does work.  So we are going to increase quality.  And we’re going to talk about, tonight,  ways we are going to do that, the approaches we are going to take. We are  going to increase access, bringing everybody into the system, which helps  us all. And we’re going to do access,  we’re going to do cost, and we’re going  to do quality improvements in this bill,  all the while preserving what works in  the current system.  And the gentleman used an example  of how we’re already paying for health  care, something I mentioned earlier.  Those who are afraid to bring new people into the system because they fear  that this is going to increase their own  costs, well, what I talk about when I  have town meetings about health care  is, again, they’re already paying  for  people who don’t have health insurance  in a variety of ways. When that individual  shows up  at  the  emergency  room, the cost shift takes place because  the person without  insurance  gets their treatment and somebody else  pays  for  it. Those of us who have  health insurance pay for it. That’s why  an aspirin costs $10.  I had knee surgery many years ago,  and to make sure that they operated  on the right knee, they put a black  magic marker that said ‘‘L’’ on my left  knee. When we got the bill, I saw that  that black magic marker to put that  ‘‘L’’ on cost $20. That’s because of the  cost shift that takes place. Now, that’s  one example. Every American who’s  had to deal with the health care system has a similar example. If everybody is covered and everybody is in the  same risk pool, we’re not going to have  that type of cost shift that takes place.  But that’s only one example of how we  are paying for it.  The gentleman talks about $1,500 of  the price of every car made  in this  country is due to health care costs because American manufacturers have to  pay for health care for their employees  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:08 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09JN7.146 H09JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
875,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN.," I thank the gentleman from Missouri for calling this  together so that we could call attention to the job losses that are happening all across the United States.  It’s in your district. It’s in my district.  It’s every one of our districts here that  are represented this evening.  And I was absolutely shocked, as I’ve  been watching this play out, of the  Federal Government  jumping  in and  taking over private businesses, beginning with Chrysler and then now with  General Motors. We’re  seeing  something that we haven’t seen.  I don’t  know if we ever have seen anything  like this in the history of our country,  and I am still livid over the conversation I had today.  ",2009
876,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time just a  minute, what you just said is so important  for people  to understand, and  that’s because we don’t have quite the  sense of history. We’ve just heard from  one of our other guests just a minute  ago that this is a 25-year high in unemployment.  But what you’ve just talked about is,  when the President goes in and fires  the president of General Motors and  appoints the people a board and decides  to rewrite the bankruptcy laws, this is  unprecedented. And I think, my good  friend, you have a specific example  from your district about what  this  could mean to Main Street America. I  wish you’d saw share that with us tonight.  ",2009
877,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN.," I do. I had met  with dealers in my district before from  Chrysler, and they looked me in the  eye and they said they were just flabbergasted. They couldn’t believe that  they got a pink slip that they were  going to be out of business by the end  of the month. All the cars that they  had on their lot they’d have to sell.  They were going have to wrap up and  go out of business by the end of the  month. And they told me that they  were one of the most successful Chrysler dealerships, not just in Minnesota,  but in the Nation. They performed 160  percent better than the top performers  in the country. They met all the criteria for staying open for Chrysler, and  still they were pink-slipped. No one  could understand.  ",2009
878,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time, I’m  just trying put myself in the shoes of  the family who owned that dealership  that you’re talking about.  ",2009
879,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN.," This  particular  family, Congressman, had put $5 million into this dealership just prior to  receiving this notice. They were slated  to adding another Jeep dealership to  the Chrysler business that they already  had. Significant amount of money, and  they  produced  tax  revenue  to  the  amount of $3 million every year on  that 5-acre parcel that they utilized.  ",2009
880,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Just reclaiming my time,  so you have a dealer who’s been  in  business  in your  town  for what,  90  years or something I think you were  saying?  ",2009
881,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN., This  particular  dealer had been in the business since  the early 1920s. The one that I spoke  with today had been in business for 90  years. They were a General Motors  dealership.  ,2009
882,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Ninety years, and their  dealership was assessed at, what was  the value of it?  ",2009
883,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN.," There’s a recent  appraisal done on this dealership, very  successful dealership. They have all the  debts paid. They own everything outright and clear, and the appraiser said  this dealership is worth $15 million.  ",2009
884,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time, so  $15 million, and then you wake up one  morning and you get this thing in the  mail and it says your $15 million just  basically vaporized, didn’t it?  ",2009
885,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Was worthless.  Now the only thing that their dealership is worth today is the underlying  property  that  the building  sits on.  They put all sorts of money into building their building, which is now free  and clear. They worked hard to make  sure they could pay for it, and now it’s  a dealership building. And as most  Americans know who are listening to  us speak this evening, if you have a  dealership building, you can’t use it for  much else other than a dealership. And  trust me, there’s no one out there right  now who’s too interested in buying an  old used dealership building because  there’s not new car dealers going up  out there.  ",2009
886,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," So once again we have another projection of  this example of  Washington thinking they know how  LUMMIS to do everything, deciding who’s going  to be the president of General Motors.  All of this money that belongs to our  constituents, we’re going to dump this  money  into various  companies, and  then we’re going to try and manage.  We can’t manage D.C. What makes us  think we can manage car companies?  What an example of—and  I  think  there  are  some  other  examples  of  what’s going on with  some of  this  spending.  And I see that we’re also joined by  Congresswoman  from Wyoming, I believe. So we’ve got the West  pretty much covered. We’ve got Iowa  covered. We’re going to have Georgia in  just a minute.  Please join us.  ",2009
887,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. LUMMIS.,"  I  thank  the  gentleman from Missouri for pulling us together this evening for this discussion.  In Wyoming, our economy  is very  much based in the energy industry because we have coal, oil, gas, uranium,  wind, solar, biomass, and that is the  mainstay of our economy by far.  b2115  So as we watch the 350 to 375 very  small businesses that are drilling for  oil and gas and see the legislation that  is coming before this Congress at the  behest of the Democratic Party, it will  devastate our businesses.  ",2009
888,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time, so  you’re  talking  about  the  tax  that  they’re proposing to pay for some of  the spending that is that cap-and-tax  situation which is going to devastate  small business, and small business, of  course, is where these jobs are created;  is that correct?  ",2009
889,87,2009-06-09,Mrs. LUMMIS.," Absolutely. I think  the Americans have  the  perception  that Big Oil is who is recovering these  natural resources; but even those firms  hire very small, literally mom-and-pop  operations, five and six employees to  go out and drill the drilling, to do some  environmental compliance, to do the  surveying, and to complete those wells,  and do the fracturing of the deep seams  that are required to cause the gas to  flow into a natural gas well. These are  very small operators. As I said, in Wyoming alone, over 350 businesses.  Yet what we  see on  the horizon  taxwise through the national energy  tax that’s being called cap-and-trade  would be utterly devastating to those  businesses.  ",2009
890,87,2009-06-09,Mr. AKIN.," Reclaiming my time, what  you’re doing is making a tremendously  important connection. And I think a  lot of people do get that impression  that all of the jobs in America are General Motors or General Electric or Mobile Oil or whatever it happens to be.  But in reality, as one of the most ranking members in small business, what  you find is you define small business as  about  500 employees or  less. Small  businesses create almost 80 percent of  the new jobs in America.  So what you’re saying is exactly spot  on to what all of our data shows, and if  you’re looking at 80 percent of the new  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:00 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09JN7.155 H09JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
891,94,2009-06-09,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.  Before yielding to our colleague from  Tennessee, Dr. ROE, a fellow OB–GYN  physician, I just want to say to my colleagues on both  sides of  the aisle,  Madam Speaker,  that what we are  about is trying to work in a cooperative way on both sides of the aisle and  offer our expertise, to say to our colleagues, and there are some health care  practitioners on the majority side as  well, and we have reached out to them  and made ourselves available, we want  to be at the table.  Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, we  are not at the table. We haven’t been  enjoined, if you will. But we still hope,  we still have hope that that can occur,  because we do have some ideas, I think  some very good  ideas,  in regard to  bringing down the cost of health care,  making it more accessible, making it  more portable, making it available to  everybody, and that would include people who are currently considered high  risk, maybe even considered uninsurable, or if they can get insurance it is  because they can afford to pay three or  four times the normal standard rate,  which many, many cannot.  So we want to talk about some of  those things tonight, and we will get  back to that.  At this point I yield to my colleague  from Tennessee, Representative ROE.  ",2009
892,94,2009-06-09,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Thank you,  Dr. GINGREYand also Madam Speaker.  It is good to be here tonight to discuss  a very important, and I believe, Dr.  GINGREYand Madam Speaker, probably  from a social standpoint, the most important issue that we will discuss, and  probably this health care debate is the  most important one since the mid-sixties when Medicare was voted on.  Just to give you a little background,  I am a native Tennessean, practiced  medicine in Johnson City, Tennessee,  in that region for 31 years, and really  saw a tremendous change in the health  care delivery system from 1970 when I  graduated  from medical school until  the current. I really marvel myself at  the miracles that occurred.  I recall when I was in medical school  when St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital  had just opened, it hadn’t been there  long, and the death rate among childhood  cancers  was  80-plus  percent.  Today, over 80 percent of those children survive and live and thrive.  We are having a debate on what kind  of system best fits America and its personality, and  I will share with you  some things we have learned in Tennessee about a public and a private system.  What I hear when I am out talking to  people is that, number one, they are  worried about the cost of care. They  are worried about the availability of it.  And there is another whole discussion  that we haven’t had, which is accessibility.  As we age, as the medical population  and caregivers age, there is going to be  a huge problem of accessibility in this  country. We are already seeing it in  our own communities, where  in the  next 7 years we will need 1 million  more registered nurses in America. In  the next 8 to 10 years there will be  more physicians  retiring and dying  than we are producing in this country.  Well, you know, that is not sustainable. You cannot maintain the quality  of care that we have grown to expect  and  the medical advances we have  grown to expect without practitioners.  That is an entirely different issue, not  part of this debate, but indeed very  much a part of this debate.  In Tennessee, about 14 or 15 years ago  we had Medicaid. We got a waiver to  try a managed care system. Back in  the eighties and nineties, managed care  was going to be how we were going to  control the ever-escalating health care  costs. So it was a wonderful idea to try  to  provide  care  to  as many Tennesseans as we could at as low a cost as  we could.  What we did was we hastily put a  plan together, as we are doing right  here in this Congress right now. The  most astounding  thing  I have  ever  heard in my life is in 60 days, or less  than that, we are going to vote on a  health care plan  that affects every  American citizen, 300 million of us.  And your health care choices, as you  know, are very personal choices. They  are between you and your physician  and your family.  So the plan was a managed care plan,  and it was a very rich plan. It provided  a lot of care for not much money, and  for some people no money. What happened was that people made very logical choices. About 45 percent of the  people who ended up on TennCare actually had private health insurance, but  dropped it. Why did they drop their  care? Well,  you  had  a  plan,  this  TennCare plan, which was cheaper, but  provided more coverage, so therefore  people made again a very conscious decision.  The problem with the plan is, as with  every public plan so far, is it does not  pay the cost of the care. That cost has  been shifted over to the private sector.  So when you look at your health insurance costs going up each year, you are  paying or supplementing, a tax really,  on your private health insurance premiums caused by the increased usage  of the public plan.  In  Tennessee,  for  instance,  the  TennCare plan covered about 60 percent of the cost of actually providing  the care. If everyone in Tennessee had  the TennCare  plan, most  providers  would lock the door, throw the key  away and walk away because  they  couldn’t pay their bills. Medicare, another plan that we have, pays about 90  percent of the cost, and our uninsured  pay somewhere in between.  Now, what I think will happen with  this public plan is that once again, because politicians are involved in designing the plan, what will happen is  more and more and more things will be  promised about what will be covered in  the plan, but when it comes to paying  for it, and if we have time we can get  in and discuss the Massachusetts plan  a little bit, what will happen is you  will have a Medicaid plan that doesn’t  pay the cost, you will have a Medicare  plan that doesn’t pay the cost, and you  will have a public  funded  ‘‘competitive’’ plan that is subsidized by government but doesn’t pay the full cost of  the care, meaning more and more costs  will be shifted on to the private payers.  b2220  Well, what will happen over time, I  think, is that, again, individuals first,  small businesses, 20, 30, 40, 50 in the  business will say, We just can’t afford  this private continually escalating cost  of private health insurance. And what  will happen then is more will be shifted  to the public plan, and over time you’ll  end up with a single-payer system. And  a lot would say, and I’ve heard it argued here on the House floor, Well, so  what? What’s wrong with  that? We  have  a  government-run,  one-payer  health care system. What’s the problem with  that? Everybody has coverage. Well, everybody has a health insurance card, but  that doesn’t necessarily mean you can get health care.  Don’t confuse a plastic card that says  you have coverage with actually getting care.  Well, what do I mean by that? Well,  let me give you an example.  When President Clinton had his heart  attack, he went to the hospital, had a  heart attack. He was operated on several days later, I think 3 or 4 days, and  probably the reason, in my opinion, he  probably got a blood thinner that took  a few days to get out of his system.  And he was operated on and went  home.  Had he had that heart attack in Canada, they would have said, Mr. Clinton,  you can go home and in 117 days, that’s  the average amount of time it takes to  get a bypass operation in Canada, you  can come back and get your bypass operation.  Two weeks ago, I was in Morristown,  Tennessee, talking to a physician there  who is Canadian. His father began to  have chest pain. I won’t go through all  the details about how long it took him  to get a treadmill, how long it took  him to see a cardiologist. Anyway, 11  months later, the man got—his left anterior descending coronary artery was  90 percent blocked, and he finally survived and got a bypass operation. I do  not believe the American people are  going  to put up with  that  type of  health care system. We are not.

We have had kind of a running debate  on the question of closing Guantanamo  prison. This is a subject the Senate has  spoken on by an overwhelming vote. I  think 90-some Senators voted not to  close Gitmo. The American people are 3  to 1 opposed to bringing Gitmo prisoners into their State. They are 2 to 1,  at least, in opposition to closing Guantanamo prison. This is not something  on which there is a little bit of doubt.  The American people are very much  opposed to closing Guantanamo prison  and bringing those people to their own  States.  Nevertheless, the assistant majority  leader and five other Democrats voted  for the appropriation of money—or the  authorization of money—actually, the  appropriation of money to close Gitmo  and acknowledge that would require  bringing many of those people to the  United States.

934,122,2009-06-09,Mr. BROWN.," Madam President,  in  1945, President Truman  delivered  a  speech to a joint session of Congress, in  which he declared:  Millions of our citizens do not now have a  full measure of opportunity to achieve and  enjoy good health. Millions do not now have  protection or security against the economic  effects of sickness. The time has arrived for  action to help them attain that opportunity  and that protection.  That was said by President Truman,  10 or 11 Presidents ago, perhaps six decades ago, and 64 years later we are still  fighting to provide that opportunity  and that protection.  A severely weakened economy, growing unemployment, rising health care  and health insurance costs, and declining employment-based  insurance are  all factors contributing to the current  health care crisis. Today, 47 million  Americans  are uninsured. An  additional 25, 30, 35, as many as 40 million  Americans are underinsured and millions of Americans are either underinsured or uninsured and are saddled  with catastrophic medical debt.  Closing the health care gap will dramatically improve the public’s health.  It will also lead predictability to national health spending, which is essential if we are going to get health care  costs under control.  Closing the health care gap would  dramatically  reduce  personal  bankruptcies, more than half of which result from catastrophic illness and the  huge bills that go with it.  Think about that for a moment. Most  bankruptcies in this country are because people have had health care bills  they simply cannot pay. Most of those  people have  those health care bills  which  they cannot pay which  then  force them into bankruptcy. Most of  those people have health insurance, but  it is inadequate and has too many gaps  in it.  Closing  the health care gap  is a  short-term and a long-term investment  in the health of Americans, the health  of U.S. businesses—businesses whose  premiums are inflated by the costs of  uncompensated care. It is an investment in the health of our economy,  which benefits from the health care industry but not from already too high  health care costs, further inflated by  needless red tape, needless duplication,  needless  indifference  to health care  needs that become more serious and  more costly when they are not caught  early.  Per capita health care spending in  the United States is 53 percent higher  here than that of any other nation in  the world, and we are the only nation  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:22 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09JN6.017 S09JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009

941,136,2009-06-09,Mr. KERRY.," I would also ask my colleague whether there is any rationale  here whatsoever, that we have seen, for  why this Justice’s entire record, which  is public, and has been poured over already, requires having the longest period in history, in terms of Justices of  the Supreme Court, particularly given  the issues that are at stake and the  convening of a new Court in October?  ",2009
942,136,2009-06-09,Mr. SCHUMER.," Well, I thank my colleague, and I think his points are well  taken. As I mentioned before, the bottom line is, any lawyer worth his salt—  and there are many very qualified lawyers in the minority on the Judiciary  Committee—could research this record  within a month, easily—easily. Right  now, in the buildings here in Washington and  in the buildings  in New  York and  in  the buildings  in Birmingham, AL, are lawyers who have  far more extensive research to do in  less time and they do it well.

945,136,2009-06-09,Mrs. BOXER.," I know we have to vote,  but I wish to speak for a minute. As a  woman, and being from California, we  have such excitement about this nomination. I know we all agree this is a  historic first, this nomination, and I  think, given that and the fact that the  women of this country comprise a majority and there is only one woman on  the Court—and we certainly have never  had a Latino on the bench—I am asking my friend, does he not believe this  nominee  should  be  accorded  equal  treatment—equal treatment as it relates to the others who have been nominated to the same post?  That is all I am asking for. I am not  on the committee, but I am supporting  our Chairman LEAHY and the rest of  the committee—at least those who are  moving toward this in a schedule similar to Justice Roberts. I would ask,  once again: Shouldn’t we, who are very  excited  about  this  nomination  and  want to see it move forward, expect to  have Judge Sotomayor treated in an  equal fashion?  ",2009
946,136,2009-06-09,Mr. SCHUMER.," I think my colleague  from California makes an  excellent  point, and I would answer in the affirmative. We are not asking for more  time. We are actually asking for less  time, if you include vacation time.  It is not a situation like with Justice  Roberts and even Judge Alito, where  there were weeks and weeks before we  were able to get private records that  were available. No one has requested—  Judge Sotomayor has not worked with  the executive, so you don’t have all  those issues that have to be discussed  and negotiated about executive privilege. She has a 17-year career on the  bench. She has 3,000 opinions. If that is  not an adequate record?  My office just in 2 days looked at  every one, for instance, of the immigration  asylum  cases  that  were  brought before her. There were 83—a  pretty good sample, 83 percent. I don’t  recall the number, but there were a  large number of cases, and 83 percent of  the time we found she denied asylum to  the  immigrant applicant, which we  concluded made it pretty clear that her  fidelity to rule of law trumped her natural sympathy for the immigrant experience.  We just did that in a day or two. I  don’t have the kind of staff that my  good  friend,  the Senator  from Alabama, has. He should have it. He is the  ranking minority Member. So it is very  easy, given the number of staff, given  the public record, given that there is  no litigation or discussion about executive privilege—as there was with both  nominee Alito and nominee Roberts—  that a month seems to me to be ample  time. The chairman, in his wisdom, to  which I will defer, gave more than a  month to the day of the nomination.  ",2009

949,136,2009-06-09,Mr. SESSIONS.," I know the Senator  from California raised the question of  doing for this nominee as the others. If  this goes forward as planned, it would  be 48 days from nomination announcement to the first hearing. I wonder if  the Senator from New York would acknowledge that for Justice Breyer it  was 60 days; for John Roberts it was 55,  the shortest; and Sam Alito was 70.  This would be much shorter a period of  time  than  the period we are being  given for this nominee, who has 3,500  cases.  I would ask if the Senator remembers  saying with regard to the Alito nomination, when  our Democratic  colleagues asked that it be held over past  Christmas, and at their request it was  done so, he said:  It is more important to do it right than to  do it quickly. And now we have a bipartisan  agreement to do that.  I  colLEAHY thank my  So we just ask for a bipartisan agreement to do it right and not too fast. I  don’t know how we can work it out,  but I think this is an arbitrary date,  designed to move this process forward  by a certain end game, faster than we  need to. The vacancy, as the Senator  knows, does not occur until October  when Justice Souter steps down. So we  do need to complete it by then. I have  told the President I will work to make  sure that occurs.  ",2009

952,136,2009-06-09,Mr. SCHUMER.," If I might respond,  with nominee Alito, now Justice Alito,  there was a Christmas break. As I understand  it, according  to Chairman  it was  the majority, Republicans, who asked we go to that Christmas break, not the Democrats. In Justice Roberts’ case, I believe Katrina intervened and everybody had to drop everything and work on the emergency of  Katrina.  If you look at days where the record  is available, and it has been available  right from the get-go here, and no vacation, no  intervening  long  recesses  and  things  like  that,  the minority  here, any Senator here, will have had  more time to scrutinize this record  than we have had  for most  other  Judges. Again, underscored by the fact  that the record is public, is open and  ample.  No one has to go look for needles in  a haystack to try to figure out the  record of Judge Sotomayor. It is very  extensive and ample. With Justice Roberts, we only had a few years where he  was on the bench and all the rest of his  record was in the executive and it took  us weeks, I think—the chairman probably remembers this better than me—  or months to get the record.  With that, I yield the floor. I know  we want to get on with the vote.  ",2009

956,171,2009-06-09,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals, FRAC, Act along with my colleague, Senator SCHUMER, that protects  drinking water and public health from  the risks associated with an oil and gas  extraction  process  called  hydraulic  fracturing. Specifically, our bill does  two things. First, it repeals an exemption to the Safe Drinking Water Act  that was granted to oil and gas companies four years ago. Second, it requires  oil and gas companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic  fracturing.  The  regulation  of hydraulic  fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water  Act is supported by 77 groups, including 14 groups from Pennsylvania.  The oil and gas industry uses hydraulic fracturing in 90 percent of wells.  The  process, which  is  also  called  ‘‘fracking,’’ involves injecting tens of  thousands of gallons of water mixed  with sand and chemical additives deep  into the rock under extremely high  pressure. The pressure breaks open the  rock  releasing  trapped natural gas,  which is then captured. Fracking often  occurs near underground  sources of  drinking water. Unfortunately, a provision included in the 2005 Energy Policy  Act  exempted  hydraulic  fracturing  from compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The oil and gas industry  is the only industry to have this exemption.  The Casey-Schumer legislation is extremely important to people living in  Pennsylvania, especially those  living  in communities along a geological formation called the Marcellus Shale. The  Marcellus  is a geological  formation  covering  34 million acres  extending  from southern New York, through central and western Pennsylvania,  into  the eastern half of Ohio and across  most of West Virginia. The deepest  layer of the Marcellus formation—the  Marcellus Shale—contains  a  significant amount of natural gas trapped in  deep rock formations up to 9,000 feet  below ground. Last year, a professor at  Penn State estimated that there was  168 million cubic feet of natural gas in  the Marcellus Shale. In the industry it  is what is known as a ‘‘Super Giant gas  field.’’ It is enough natural gas to provide for the entire country for 7 years.  This vast amount of natural gas combined with a more complete knowledge  of  the  natural  fractures  in  the  Marcellus Shale through which the gas  can be easily extracted, has led to what  Pennsylvanians are calling a gas rush.  As I have mentioned,  fracking  involves  injecting water mixed with  chemicals. My major concern is that  the chemicals added to the water to  create fracking fluids are highly toxic.  We’re  talking about  chemicals  like  formaldehyde, benzene, and  toluene.  These  chemicals  are  injected  right  below  underground  drinking water.  This is especially important to Pennsylvania because our state has the second highest number of private wells for  drinking water in the nation, second  only to Michigan. Three million Pennsylvanians are dependent on private  wells to provide safe drinking water to  their homes. So massive drilling to get  to the natural gas  in the Marcellus  Shale is not required to comply with  the Safe Drinking Water Act, but drilling is happening right next to drinking  water supplies. You can see why Pennsylvanians are concerned about their  future access to safe drinking water.  Now, the oil and gas industry would  have you believe  that  there  is no  threat to drinking water from hydraulic fracturing. But the fact is we are already  seeing cases  in Pennsylvania,  Colorado, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Wyoming, Ohio, Arkansas, Utah,  Texas, and New Mexico where residents  have become ill or groundwater has become  contaminated  after  hydraulic  fracturing  operations  began  in  the  area. This is not simply anecdotal evidence;  scientists have  found enough  evidence to raise concerns as well. In a  recent  letter supporting our bill, 23  health  professionals  and  scientists  wrote the following:  . . . Oil and gas operations are known to  release substances into the environment that  are known to be very hazardous to human  health, including benzene, arsenic, mercury,  hydrogen sulfide, and radioactive materials.  The demonstrated health effects caused by  these  substances  include cancers, central  nervous system damage, skin and eye irritation, and lung diseases. For example, fluids  used in the hydraulic fracturing process may  contain  toxic  chemicals  such  as  2–  butoxyethanol,  formaldehyde,  sodium hydroxide, glycol ethers, and naphthalene. For  these reasons, we support regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking  Water Act and the disclosure of all chemical  constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids to  public agencies, including the disclosure of  constituent  formulas  in cases of medical  need. Moreover, we support full regulation of  stormwater runoff, which can pollute drinking water supplies, under the Clean Water  Act.  There are growing reports of individuals  living near oil and gas operations who suffer  illnesses that are linked to these activities,  yet there has been no systemic attempt to  gather the necessary data, establish appropriate monitoring, analyze health exposure  or assess risk related to any of these activities. This should be done, in addition to full  Health Impact Assessments to inform future  planning and policy efforts.  In Dimock, Pennsylvania, we have a  recent example of the risks involved  with  hydraulic  fracturing. On New  Year’s Day, Norma Fiorentino’s drinking water well exploded. It  literally  blew up. Stray methane leaked and migrated upward through the rock and  into the aquifer as natural gas deposits  were drilled nearby. An investigation  by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  shows that a spark created when the  pump in the well house turned on may  have led to the explosion. The blast  cracked in half the several-thousand-  pound concrete slab at the drilling pad  on Ms.  Fiorentino’s  property  and  tossed  it aside. Fortunately, no one  was hurt in the explosion. But throughout the town, several drinking water  wells have exploded and nine wells  have been found to contain so much  natural gas that one homeowner was  advised to open a window if he plans to  take a bath. Tests of the well water  show high amounts of aluminum and  iron, which leads researchers to believe  that drilling fluids are contaminating  the water along with the gas. So this is  a real concern. We are talking about  serious implications if we don’t develop  the Marcellus Shale carefully and responsibly.  I would point out that Pennsylvania  has a long history of developing our  natural resources to power the region  and the nation. In fact, Pennsylvania is  home  to  the  Drake  Well  near  Titusville, Pennsylvania, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year.  The Drake Well was the first commercial oil well in the United States and it  launched the modern petroleum industry. In addition to oil, Western Pennsylvania has long produced natural gas.  Pennsylvania also mines coal which we  use to provide electricity to many of  our neighboring states. Pennsylvanians  are proud of the contributions we have  made to the growth of our nation. Contributions that were made because we  developed our abundant natural  resources. But we also bear the burden of  some environmental legacies, most created in previous generations when we  were not as concerned with responsible  development. We have old natural gas  wells that were not capped and leak  methane into homes in Versailles, PA.  We have acid mine drainage that we  spend millions of dollars every year to  try and remediate. These examples are  the  lessons  from which we need to  learn.  Pennsylvania will develop the natural gas in the Marcellus Shale. We are  doing  it right now, and we will see  more drilling over the next few years.  But we must develop the Marcellus  Shale using  the best environmental  practices to protect our communities  and our state. That is why I am introducing the Fracturing Responsibility  and Awareness of Chemicals Act. This  legislation will ensure that hydraulic  fracturing does not unnecessarily jeopardize our groundwater. There are affordable alternatives that oil and gas  companies can use so that they are not  risking contaminating drinking water  wells  with  potentially  hazardous  chemicals.  I  think  Norma  Fiorentino  from  Dimock, Pennsylvania, summed it up  best when she told a reporter,  ‘‘You  can’t buy a good well.’’  So I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure that  our groundwater is protected as we responsibly  develop  our  natural  resources.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:57 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A09JN6.037 S09JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009

961,185,2009-06-09,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker, today  I am proud to introduce the Medicare Transition Care Act of 2009.  When people leave the hospital after an operation or illness, they are often overwhelmed  by a complicated and risky road to recovery.  Patients  frequently  report difficulty  remembering  clinical  instructions,  confusion  over  medications, and, in cases where multiple providers are  involved, often get conflicting  instructions from different providers. Providing a  transitional care benefit within Medicare will  help coordinate care, develop a care plan for  patients and their caregivers, identify potential  health  risks, and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.  This bipartisan legislation gets to the heart  of  improving quality while reducing costs. A  study published in April 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine  found  that almost  one-third of Medicare beneficiaries  studied  who were discharged from a hospital were re-  hospitalized within 90 days. Additionally, one-  half of the individuals re-hospitalized had not  visited a physician since their discharge, indicating a lack of follow-up care. The study estimated  that Medicare spent $17.4 billion  in  2004 on unplanned re-hospitalizations.  The Medicare Transition Care Act will directly address continuity of care problems by  increasing support  to patients as  they move  from the hospital to their new care setting and  ensuring that appropriate follow-up care is provided during this vulnerable period. The benefit would be phased-in, initially targeting just  the most at-risk individuals by providing evidence-based transitional care services tailored  to their specific needs.  I am proud  to partner with Congressman  BOUSTANY, a cardiothoracic surgeon, on  this  commonsense legislation that will improve the  quality and efficiency of our health care system.  f  HONORING  THE  INDIANA  NATIONAL GUARD’S  1313TH  ENGINEER COMPANY WHO WILL SOON  BE DEPLOYING TO IRAQ  HON. BARON P. HILL  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 9, 2009  ",2009
962,185,2009-06-09,Mr. HILL.," Madam Speaker, today, I would  like  to pay honor  to  the  Indiana National  Guard’s 1313th Engineer Company, who will  be deploying to Iraq in July and spending the  next year there. These brave citizen soldiers,  based out of Camp Atterbury in Edinburgh, IN,  will be conducting a wide range of engineering  missions  in support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom; including searching for improvised explosive devices, building roads and bridges, and,  in general, improving lives to both our service  personnel in Iraq and Iraqi civilians.  I am confident  that  their skilled work and  dedication to duty will save lives, improve conditions in Iraq, and ultimately work toward the  completion of our country’s mission in Iraq.  I would also  like  to honor  the  families of  these Guardsmen, who without their love and  support, would make this already difficult task  that much more challenging. They too share in  the hardships of military service, and they too  deserve our utmost thanks and respect.  These brave Hoosier Guardsmen and their  families will be in my thoughts and prayers.  f  CONGRATULATING  RAMSEY  POLICE DEPARTMENT D.A.R.E. PROGRAM STUDENTS  HON. SCOTT GARRETT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 9, 2009  Mr. GARRETT  of New  Jersey. Madam  Speaker,  today,  the Ramsey Police Department will hold  its D.A.R.E. graduation ceremony with the students from the John Y. Dater  and St. Paul  Interparochial Schools.  The  young people participating  in  this  important  program have made a commitment to say no  to drugs, underage drinking, and gang violence. They have done this with the support of  Chief of Police Bryan Gurney and the brave  men and women of  the Ramsey Police Department.  Drug  Abuse  Resistance  Education,  or  D.A.R.E., began as a small program  in Los  Angeles in 1983. Today, it is implemented in  more than 75 percent of our nation’s school  districts and  in more  than 43 other nations.  This program allows children  to defeat  the  negative cultural influences that they are challenged with daily by opening the lines of communication  between  law  enforcement  and  youth and empowering them with confidence  and courage to say no to drugs.  I am proud of the young boys and girls who  participated in this program in Ramsey, and I  would like to recognize them all for taking this  step toward positive citizenship:  Mark Andersen, Michael Babikian, Samuel  Berman, Brianna Bussiere, Olivia Carriero, Michael Cassella, Francesca De Palo, Matthew  De Pinto, Sonny Del Valle, Ross Farcas,  Fiona Flood, Melanie Greenberg, Dwight Han,  Sarah  Hattar,  Lindsay  Hoffman, Morgan  Kleinberg,  Julie McNamara,  Justin Millet,  Brandon  O’Callahan,  Courtney  Schreiber,  Ryan Scialla, Nikita Serafin, Ashley Sicard,  Jacob Simpson, Zachary Becher, Jessica Bell,  Jacob  Berkofsky,  Kaley  Bogden, Michael  Brunton, Elizabeth Burch, Michael Careccia,  Connor  Chamberlin,  Kara  Checke,  Emily  Derleth, Marc Doran, Shannon Fine, Joseph  Frohlich, Christina Goudelias, Joseph Guthrie,  Patrick Journick, Brian Lander, Elaine Les,  Enmanuel Lugo Abreu, Brandon Mazzola, Rebecca Moya, Allison Murphy, Stephen Pirro,  Kelly Richter, Alaina Sebes, Lucas Alvarez,  Rosemary Arpino, Christopher Di Palma, Katherine Donnelly, Daniel Donovan, Ryan Faulkner, Thomas Feehan, Daniel Giallombardo,  Meredith Halik, Haruna Ishii, Kevin Johns, Melissa  Lara, Devan  Larson, Maria Martino,  Jesse  Mitchell,  Megan  Murphy,  Mariana  Perez, Eric Pflugfelder, Stephen Porter, Christine Song, Austin Triglia, Kayla Vanderbilt,  Siera Vari, Alexandra Aloi, Robert Beers,  Joshua  Bialkin,  Emma  Bogaenko, Megan  Bosso, Gregory Botz, Carlie Capela, Joseph  Carroll, Nicole De Franco, Matthew Donnelly,  Bridget Gregory, JohnEric Hornyak, Ashley  Houser, Kenneth Kasprzak, Kevin Latz, Kellen  McDonald, Peter McNally, Kazuki Miyamoto,  Amanda Nedelkoff, Bridget Quinn, Victoria  Stitz, Samantha Stollman, Caitlin Sweeney,  Evan Szucs, John Alicandri, Jenna Bahnsen,  Olivia Cseh, Matthew Desimone, Conor Dobson, Olivia Gilligan, Mackenzie Juhlin, Elise  Kelly, Sean Kopczynski, Kelsey Larkin, Erin  Latz, Katherine Lenahan, Garrett Mast, Kathryn Miller, Jennifer Monteith, Patrick O’Keefe,  Jeffrey Padovano, Jacqueline Pesco, Sean  Riordan,  Jared  Schwarz,  Alexander  Sebastiano, Haydn Van Dyk, Lauren Venturini,  Kaitlyn Zwerling, Sarah Ahearn, Kayla Azouri,  Danny  Balbuena,  Tye  Baruffaldi,  Nicole  Borbone, Samuel Brickman, Gabrielle Daniels,  Kristen Foelsch, Anne Glerum, Jake Gursaly,  Josue Herrera, Siranush Hovhannisyan, Kathryn Iannuzzi, Kazel Kapadia, Brendan Mahon,  Peter  Mariani,  Robert  McOwen,  Victoria  Medlicott, David Mende, Harrison Mobbs, Jessica Pevny, Elena Polin, Henry Ruitenberg,  Ryan Shevlin, Christopher Spittler, Kimberly  Tuntigian, Brita Andersen,  Taylor Corbett,  Julia D’Antonio, Matthew Davidson, Sean  Donnelly, Sean Donohue, Timothy Finnegan,  Lillian Hong, Samantha Hotz, Harrison  Illes,  Brendan Jahnke, Khadija Khan, Lily Kramer,  Brian  Kurnentz,  Lacey  Laggan,  Thomas  Lanning,  James Messina,  John Milligan,  James O’Keefe,  James Pupalaikis, Alyssa  Rose, Breanna Russell, Elisa Silecchia, Kara  Sutcliffe, Anna Wanner, Jack August, Brooke  Bernier,  Carlo  Alberto  Bolognini,  Kelly  Carolan,  Jake  Cataldo,  Christina  Cowie,  Deanna De Luca, Brooke Dommenge, Matthew  Eng,  Jacob  Englishman,  Zachary  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:17 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09JN8.006 E09JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 S D O O W W         ",2009
963,192,2009-06-09,Mr. SHUSTER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  the accomplishments of  the  Bishop Guilfoyle High School girls basketball  team of Altoona, PA. As  the 2009 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class  A girls basketball champions,  the Lady Marauders have shown the discipline and teamwork required to achieve greatness.  The Lady Marauders have a rich history of  achievement. Having won two PIAA Class A  championships  in  three  seasons, and  five  overall, the Lady Marauders are no strangers  to success. Their season’s record of 30–1 is  tied for the second most in a single season in  Lady Marauder program history.  This year’s season came  to a close on  March 21st at University Park, PA, and resulted in a 49–27 defeat of Nativity BMV by  Bishop Guilfoyle’s Lady Marauders. The hard  work and  talent of  the nineteen players, as  well as their five coaches, most certainly led to  this rewarding experience.  These young women are exemplary athletes  and their pride in their performance is an inspiration to all of Blair County. I believe that  this championship will be one of many successes in the lives of these talented players  and coaches, and I congratulate them for all  their efforts.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR. ISAIAH R.

964,192,2009-06-09,Mr. CLYBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to an outstanding constituent and an award-winning educator, Dr.  Isaiah R. McGee. Dr. McGee is a 2009 recipient of  the South Carolina  Independent Colleges  and Universities  Inc. Excellence  in  Teaching Award. He is the director of choral  studies and assistant professor of music at  Claflin University. He also directs the Claflin  University Concert Choir.  Dr. McGee  is a native South Carolinian,  having been born and raised in Anderson. He  is a graduate of my alma mater, South Carolina State University, and earned his masters  from  the University of South Carolina. Dr.  McGee earned his doctorate  from Florida  State University  in Music Education—Choral  Conducting, and served as a graduate assistant and director of the Gospel Choir at Florida  State.  During his career, Dr. McGee has earned a  reputation as an accomplished vocalist, conductor, adjudicator, and clinician. He has international experience, debuting as the Conte in  Cimarosa’s  II Convito at Teatro Signorelli  in  Cortona, Italy. He stays very active in professional organizations  including  the American  Choral Directors Association and MENC.  Dr. McGee joined the Claflin University faculty in 1997, and has made an enviable mark  on the Orangeburg campus. Dr. McGee is always  looking  for ways  to enrich  the experiences of his students  to promote  their performance and their commitment to their craft.  Last year, he took Claflin’s Concert Choir to  China to participate in the pre-Olympic ceremonies. They performed in both Beijing and  Shanghai.  Dr. McGee has developed a great deal of  respect  from his  colleagues and  students.  Claflin University’s president Dr. Henry Tisdale  calls him ‘‘an exemplary member of our faculty  and  committed  to  teaching  and  service.’’  Claflin’s vice president for academic affairs Dr.  George Miller says, ‘‘Dr. McGee’s approach to  teaching and scholarship with his student partners demonstrates the strength of the amalgam that results when theory and practice are  combined.’’  Dr. McGee was selected for the Excellence  in Teaching Award by his peers at Claflin University. The purpose of the award is to honor  faculty members who demonstrate the highest  standards of teaching that encourage students  to strive for excellence in their studies and intellectual pursuits. In addition to the recognition, Dr. McGee receives a $3,000 grant to be  used for professional development opportunities.

McKiernan, U.S. Army, outgoing  Commander of NATO’s International Security  Assistance Force  (ISAF)  and Commander  U.S. Forces Afghanistan, who served our Nation with distinction during 37 years of faithful  service.

970,1,2009-06-18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Without  objection, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN) is recognized  for 1 minute.  There was no objection.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  rise to commend my good friend, Rabbi  Solomon Schiff, for the uplifting prayer that he delivered for all of us today,  as well as  for his tireless effort to  strengthen our religious communities  in my home district of south Florida.  Rabbi Schiff serves as the Director of  Chaplaincy Emeritus for the Greater  Miami Jewish Federation. In this role,  Rabbi Schiff offers educational support  and comfort to those  in the Jewish  communities in the United States, in  Israel,  and  indeed  throughout  the  world.  I have  long been aware of Rabbi  Schiff’s commitment and contributions  to academia, to the Jewish community,  and to the social welfare of all residents of south Florida.  The spirit of optimism and determination that Rabbi Schiff possesses  can be seen in this week’s Torah portion. After returning from the Land of  Israel, Caleb reports to the Jewish people that ‘‘we should surely go up, and  inherit the land; for we are certainly  able.’’  Rabbi Schiff’s hard work on behalf of  the Jewish community has been tireless and always with contagious optimism. No task  is too  large and no  cause is without merit.  But his greatest achievement is his  family, including his lovely wife, Shirley, and his three adult sons: Elliott,  his wife, Alisa, and their children, Michael and Brooke; Jeffrey, his wife,  Risa, and  their children, Chananya,  Moshe and Noah; and Steven, his wife,  Jacqueline, and  their children, Jennifer and Jeremy.  The opening prayer Rabbi Schiff presented today reflects his intellectual  fiber, as well as his determination to  improve our community and our country.  I thank Rabbi Schiff for his invocation and look forward to working with  him in the years ahead.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2009

Mr. Chairman, it’s been 9 long years  since the coveted Roll Call trophy was  able to sit on this desk. And I want to,  first of all, offer my congratulations to  our  Republican  teammates.  SHIMKUSpitched a fantastic game. He’s  a real gamer. They fought long and  hard, but this year was our year.  I’m happy  to  announce  that  the  Democrats won the game 15–10. JOE  BACA, at the age of 62, pitched a complete game, gave up just eight hits, and  BARTSTUPAKwas tremendous in the  field, and TIMBISHOPwas tremendous  at the bat.

I  was going to object to this breach of  the rules of the House allowing Mr.  DOYLEto speak out of order, but I was  too slow.  It is a very disappointing sight, Mr.  Chairman, to see that trophy in an unaccustomed place. But  last night at  National Stadium,  the Democrats—  very uncharacteristically—played like  Republicans: They played very well;  they played as a  team;  they  even  played by the rules, Mr. Chairman. And  as a result, they won the game fair and  square 15–10.  I want to commend Mr. DOYLEfor his  excellent managerial skills, Mr. BACA,  Mr. STUPAK, and Mr. BISHOPwho were  the tri-MVPs. I want to commend on  our side our MVP, GRESHAMBARRETT;  SHIMKUS, who pitched and did  well, and SAMGRAVESwho made several highlight catches in the outfield.  It was a good game. The Democrats  did deserve to win—but don’t get accustomed to it because we will be back,  in the spirit of good competition. And  as Mr. DOYLEsaid, it was for the Washington Literacy Council and the Washington area Boys & Girls Club.  I do want to thank the Nationals for  letting us use their field, and my guess  is they will be calling up some of the  Democrats to play on their team since  you have a better winning record now  than they do.

1020,64,2009-06-18,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam President, first,  at this point, I wish to thank Senators  HARKINand BROWNBACK for the initiative they have taken, for their leadership in bringing before the Senate this  healing resolution, this formal apology  for slavery and racial segregation.  The resolution before us presents us  with the opportunity to address face-  to-face the unconscionable and the abhorrent acts of slavery and its aftermath perpetrated against fellow human  beings. The  apology  resolution  describes some of the gravest injustices  of slavery: families enslaved, then torn  further apart after  family members  were sold separately, stripped of their  names and heritage; a system of forced  labor that persisted for 250 years; brutal and unspeakable acts of violence  against slaves. The injustices continued well after the 13th amendment to  the Constitution ended slavery in our  Nation because Jim Crow laws disenfranchised  former  slaves  and  subjugated them as second-class citizens.  After presenting detailed findings regarding slavery and the system of de  jure segregation known as Jim Crow,  the resolution reads, in part, that the  Senate:  Acknowledges the fundamental injustice,  cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws; Apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people of the  United States  for  the wrongs committed  against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws; and,  Expresses its recommitment to the principle  that all people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty  and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on all  people of the United States to work toward  eliminating racial prejudices, injustices and  discrimination from our society.  In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution formally apologizing for another  tragic legacy of historic racial inequalities  in our Nation:  lynching. From  1880 to as recently as the 1960s, an estimated 5,000 Americans, predominantly  African Americans, were killed by public hangings, burnings, and mutilation.  Members of the Armed Forces were  lynched in the country they had defended.

1022,71,2009-06-18,Mr.  CARPER.," Madam  thank you very much.  President,  f  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS  ADMINISTRATION  ",2009
1023,71,2009-06-18,Mr. CARPER.," Madam President,  I  take the floor for a few minutes to  draw the attention of my colleagues to  the fact that there is a birthday this  year, a 75th birthday—not the birthday  of a Member of the Senate, not a birthday of a Member of the House, but actually it is the 75th birthday of the National Archives and Records Administration. It is 75 years old this year.  My colleague who is presiding today  may recall the reception that was held  at the National Archives during our  orientation for new Senators and their  spouses back in November. As it turns  out, it was a small group of people who  were able to witness and to visually see  and read some of the most  famous  short documents in our Nation’s history.  But as it turns out, millions of Americans come every year and visitors  from all over the world come each year  to visit the National Archives. The National Archives serves as the custodian  of some of our county’s most precious  and historic records and documents,  and  they have been doing  this  for  something like three-quarters of a century.  I wish to take a moment on behalf of  all of my colleagues, Democratic and  Republican, and an Independent or two,  to thank the men and women who work  at the National Archives now—and who  have done that for the last three-quarters of a century—who work diligently  to preserve our Nation’s history, not  just for us but for future generations of  Americans and others who will come to  our shores to visit here.  Established by Congress to be our  Nation’s record keeper, the National  Archives has the critical mission of  storing and protecting our most valuable and our most  important documents. In fact, the main Archives facility, which  is  located not  far  from  where we are gathered here today, is  the permanent home of—get this—the  Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.  Thomas Jefferson once said that an  educated citizenry will ensure a free  society. He was right then. That  is  right now. Unhindered access to information  about  our  government  and  leaders is truly critical to the continued health and vibrancy of our democracy.  That is why I am pleased to hear that  more than 1 million visitors travel to  the National Archives each year to see  thousands of documents—the ones  I  mentioned and others as well—records,  and special exhibits. It is no stretch to  say the National Archives is one of the  most popular agencies in the U.S. Government. That probably comes as a  surprise to a lot of us.  But the Archives is not just a tourist  attraction. Over  the years,  the Archives has become an  international  leader  in  developing  an  electrical  records archiving system that will preserve digital information in any format—not just for a few years but forever.  Information technology has forever  altered our ability to create, access,  and search information from any location  in  the world. Every year, billions—not millions, billions—of documents that shape and inform government decisions are never written down  with pen and paper.  Instead,  these  records are ‘‘born digital.’’ That means  they are  created  electronically and  stored not in a filing cabinet but on  computers and on the Internet.  Each year,  the Archives preserves  more and more information that is essential to understanding our democracy, our history, and our culture. To  put it into some kind of perspective, it  took eight C–5 military cargo planes to  transport all of the paper materials  created by the Clinton administration.  Imagine that: eight C–5 military cargo  aircraft. Following  the most  recent  Presidential transition, it took 20 tractor trailers, 2 Boeing 747s, and a DC–8  aircraft to transport all of President  George W. Bush’s records. At the same  time, the National Archives continues  to maintain records from 1775, including the military record of every single  veteran in the 20th and 21st centuries.  That is no small task.  So I stand here today to give my  thanks—really, to give our thanks—to  the hard-working folks who work and  volunteer their time at our National  Archives.  Winston Churchill once said:  A nation that forgets its past is doomed to  repeat it.  I think that quote truly sums up the  important role of the Archives, not  just for our history but for our future.  Madam President, tomorrow I will  submit, with a number of my colleagues, a resolution to commend the  National Archives and  its employees  for excellent service over the past 75  years and to wish them many years of  additional service.  f  HEALTH CARE  ",2009
1024,71,2009-06-18,Mr. CARPER.," Madam President,  I  know my colleague from Wisconsin is  standing to speak, so I will be very  brief. I just want to take a moment.  While Senator SHAHEENand Senator  BOXERwere speaking, I went over and  chatted a little bit with one of our colleagues  from Texas who was on the  floor. We talked a little bit about the  debate on health care. As we approach,  ENZI in a week or two, marking up a health  care reform bill in the Finance Committee, he mentioned to me something  I very much agree with, the 80–20 rule.  MIKEENZI, the Senator from Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80–20 rule  and why he has been so productive over  the years with Senator TEDKENNEDY.  Senator KENNEDY, obviously, is a liberal Member of the Senate. Senator  is a very conservative Member of  the Senate. They get a lot done in the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is because they follow what Senator ENZIcalls the 80–20  rule. They focus on the 80 percent of  the stuff they agree on. They set aside  the 20 percent they do not agree on,  and they really  focus on where the  most agreement is.  We need to do a similar kind of approach as we prepare to mark up in the  Finance Committee the health reform  bill, to go along with the areas of work  going on in the HELP Committee.  I strongly agree with Senator BAUCUS  and Senator GRASSLEY. We need a bipartisan bill. I know many Democrats  and Republicans feel we need a bipartisan bill. My fear is, if we do not have  a bipartisan bill, we will not be successful ultimately.  While most of the media coverage of  the health care debate focuses on the  conflict—should we have a public plan  or not; tax exclusions; what portion of  our benefits should be excluded from  taxation; should there be an employer  mandate  or  individual mandate  or  should  there not be—setting all of  those things aside, not that they are  unimportant, there is huge agreement  on a bunch of things that are important that are going to save money,  save lives, reduce costs, and provide  better health care for people. Part of it  is in information technology; make it  possible for businesses—large and small  but especially small businesses—to get  into a purchasing pool to be able to  take advantage of much  lower rates  and have better choices of benefits for  their  folks; moving  toward  chronic  care to make sure for people who have  diabetes that we do not just wait until  they get really sick and they have to  have arms and legs and feet amputated,  but make sure we take care of them  early on as we go along.  As to these purchasing pools we are  going to create under health care reform, if people have a preexisting condition, they do not get excluded. They  can participate as well. We are going to  be covering more people for pharmaceuticals. We are going to do a much  better job of making sure people who  will benefit from a particular pharmaceutical—whether  it  is a  large molecule or a small molecule—will have  access to something that is going to  help them. We will be smart enough to  figure  out  the  pharmaceuticals  out  there that will not help somebody, so  then they will not be taking those.  We are going to be focusing more on  primary care, less on fee for service,  which drives up the cost of health care.

1029,85,2009-06-18,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President,  I am  going to yield to the Senator  from  Oklahoma, but before I do, I wish to  take just 30 seconds to respond quickly  to the Senator from Michigan.  The idea that we haven’t done anything for the automobile industry is  really hard to accept, $83 billion having  been spent on the automobile industry.  The idea that $1 billion is just a small  amount of money is also very hard to  accept; $1 billion of new debt is $1 billion that our children are going to have  to pay, and it is not a small amount of  money, and it compounds. We fly in the  face of the procedures which the Democratic  leader set up around here to  have pay-go and to have the Open and  Honest Leadership Act, we fly in the  face of that by putting in this bill this  special interest piece of legislation, unpaid for, and it is totally inexcusable.  This has nothing to do with funding  the troops—nothing. The fact that $1  billion is being spent and not paid for  is totally irresponsible. It is debt our  children do not need to receive.  At this point, I yield 10 minutes to  the Senator from Oklahoma.  ",2009
1030,85,2009-06-18,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, I ask to  be made aware when I have 1 minute  remaining.  ",2009
1031,85,2009-06-18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator will be so notified.  ,2009
1032,85,2009-06-18,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, on June  16, the House passed the bill we have  been talking about here. I have concerns that have not been discussed in  the last few minutes.  Although the Senate voted 90 to 6 on  a bipartisan amendment  to prohibit  funding for the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States, the supplemental  appropriations  conference  report deleted that language. That language came from an amendment that  was authored by myself and my good  friend  from Hawaii, Senator INOUYE,  but they stripped that language. The  Senate’s bipartisan amendment would  have effectively prevented the closing  of the terrorist detention facility at  Gitmo. Since President Obama  announced  that he  intended  to  close  Gitmo, it has become widely circulated  that these detainees could be transferred to American prisons for prosecution in U.S. criminal courts and potentially released in the United States.  In February of this year, I led a delegation—I  have  been  there  several  times—a  delegation  that had never  been down to Gitmo, and they saw the  fine treatment the detainees get down  there and saw the rooms where torturing supposedly is going on. Not one  incident of torture has ever been documented.

1038,92,2009-06-18,Mr. BURRIS.," Madam President, next  month, the Fourth of July, this Nation  will pause to remember the moment  when we asserted our independence and  declared ourselves free from tyranny.  It is a day all Americans hold dear, and  rightly so.  But on the 19th of this month, which  will be tomorrow, many in this country  observe another independence day. It  echoes the ideals laid down in that first  declaration.  It  celebrates  liberation  from a more oppressive tyranny.  It  marks a ‘‘new birth of freedom’’ for the  slaves who had been excluded from the  promise of the American dream.  That is why I have submitted this  Senate resolution observing the historical  significance  of  that  day—  Juneteenth Independence Day.  Slavery officially ended in the Confederate States of America when President Lincoln signed the Emancipation  Proclamation on January 1, 1863. But  many slaves did not learn of their freedom until much later.  Finally, on June 19, 1865, more than 2  years after the Emancipation Proclamation, Union soldiers led by Major  General Gordon Granger  arrived  in  Galveston, TX. They brought news that  must have been almost unbelievable to  all who heard it—especially those who  had known no  existence outside of  bondage. The Civil War was over, they  announced, and all slaves were free.  From that day on, former slaves in  the Southwest celebrated June 19 as  the anniversary of their emancipation.  Over the past 144 years, Juneteenth  Independence Day  celebrations have  been held to honor African-American  freedom. But this date has come to  hold  even  greater  significance.

1039,99,2009-06-18,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, today I  pay special tribute to the outstanding  accomplishments  of  Jane Margaret  O’Brien, Ph.D. president of St. Mary’s  College since 1996. I was a member of  the St. Mary’s Board of Trustees and  have known Maggie for many years. I  have the utmost respect for her and  what she has been able to accomplish  at St. Mary’s during her tenure.  During her 13 years as president, the  College has distinguished  itself as a  premier honors college that excels at  scholarship, research, creative thinking, community engagement, and an  appreciation and commitment to world  issues, cultures, and communities.  Dr. O’Brien provided critical guidance to the development of the college’s  external  relations  and  fundraising efforts during its transition to  the Honors College Curriculum. Fundraising during Dr. O’Brien’s tenure has  profoundly  reshaped  the  college’s  scholarships,  professorships,  lecture  and learning series, arts, athletic, and  community programs.  I will provide two examples of Dr.  O’Brien’s wonderful legacy. The Center  for the Study of Democracy, an advisory board on which I have had the  pleasure of serving since 2002, was established with a $2 million National  Endowment  for  the  Humanities—  NEH—grant  and  challenge matches.  The center is a leading programmatic  initiative  between  the  college  and  neighboring Historic St. Mary’s City.  This relationship continues to flourish  with the opportunity for students to  serve as Maryland Heritage Scholars  and for faculty from the college and  the city to serve as Maryland Heritage  Fellows.  The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, where Dr. O’Brien will  continue her work for St. Mary’s, was  founded in 1975 for two purposes: to establish in Oxford a permanent institute  for the interdisciplinary study of the  Middle Ages and Renaissance, and to  provide academic training for overseas  students who wish to study at Oxford.  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Maggie O’Brien for her stellar  leadership at St. Mary’s College and in  wishing her success in her continuing  work on behalf of this unique institution.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF PARK  RIVER, NORTH DAKOTA  ∑",2009
1040,99,2009-06-18,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I wish  today to recognize a community  in  North Dakota that will be celebrating  its 125th anniversary. On July 2–5, 2009,  the residents of Park River will gather  to celebrate their community’s history  and founding.  The town of Park River was founded  in 1884. It was named for its location on  the Park River. The river itself was  named by pioneer fur trader Alexander  Henry, to note the corrals or parks  that the Assiniboine Indians had built  by the river to herd wild animals.  Park River’s  town motto,  ‘‘Park  River, The Town with a Heart,’’ truly  captures the essence of the community  where people are always willing to lend  a helping hand. The town’s all volunteer  ambulance  service,  the Walsh  County EMS, operates 24 hours a day  and demonstrates the town’s willingness to help each other out.  Today, the town’s economy is mostly  agricultural based, but also does focus  on  incorporating  businesses  in  the  technology  and  health  care  sector.  Park River’s health care industry is  epitomized by its state-of-the-art hospital, First Care Health Center. This  center has been providing quality medical care for the past 55 years to the  residents of Park River and those in  surrounding communities.  To celebrate their 125th anniversary,  the people of Park River have planned  a number of events including a polka  fest, talent show, fireworks, road rally,  an all class reunion, an American Legion baseball reunion game, and a parade that will be held on July 4th.  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to  join me in congratulating Park River,  ND, and its residents on their first 125  years  and  in  wishing  them  well  through the next century. By honoring  Park River and all the other historic  small towns of North Dakota, we keep  the  great  pioneering  frontier  spirit  alive for future generations. It is places  such as Park River that have helped to  shape  this country  into what  it  is  today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.  Park River has a proud past and a  bright future.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CANDO,  NORTH DAKOTA  ∑",2009

On July  2–5, the residents of Cando will gather  to celebrate their community’s history  and founding.  Founded  in  1884, Cando was  designated the county seat  for Towner  County and named for the ‘‘Can Do’’  spirit of the pioneers. That spirit is  still visible in this active community,  where hunting, fishing, camping, and  bird-watching are all popular activities. In fact, ducks are so common to  the area that Cando is known as the  duck capital of North Dakota.  This active community,  located  in  north-central North Dakota, is home  to two museums, a golf course, bowling  alley, and many thriving businesses.  In honor of Cando’s 125th anniversary, town officials have organized activities including a golf tournament,  street dance, folk dance, parade, potluck, tractor pull, and variety show.  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to  join me in congratulating Cando, ND,  and its residents on their first 125 years  and in wishing them well in the future.  By honoring Cando and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we  keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is  places such as Cando that have helped  shape  this country  into what  it  is  today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.

He  began his law enforcement career in  1973 as Star City, AR, chief of police  before he was commissioned on January 17, 1977, as a state trooper assigned  to the highway patrol division, troop E  headquartered in Dumas, AR. Robertson distinguished himself in the line of  duty and worked his way up the promotion ladder quickly from the rank of  sergeant, to lieutenant, and finally, in  1999, to the rank of captain, highway  patrol commander, troop F, the largest  geographical troop in the State covering nine counties in southeast Arkansas.  Under Captain Robertson’s leadership  as troop F commander, his troopers  consistently led the State in DWI arrests and other activities despite having fewer personnel than most other  troops. His dedication to keeping his  fellow Arkansans safe extended beyond  the highway patrol division. During his  30 years of service, he led the Arkansas  motor  vehicle  inspection  team  and  served as a sniper and later commander  of troop E special response team.  Captain Robertson retires from the  Arkansas State Police on June 30, 2009.  His commitment to excellence sets an  example for not only his fellow law enforcement officers, for whom he is a  mentor and friend, but also for those in  the civilian community he worked diligently to protect. Although he will be  missed in the line of duty, I wish him  continued  success  in his  retirement  and thank him for his service to our  great State of Arkansas.∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF  MCLAUGHLIN, SOUTH DAKOTA  ∑",2009

1047,134,2009-06-18,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, it is  with deep sadness that I rise today to recognize the extraordinary life and contributions of  Judge Sandra Otaka, a constituent of mine  and a dear friend, who died on June 6. Judge  Otaka is remembered not just for her brilliant  legal career but for a life committed to fighting  for equality and justice for all. She died too  soon and she will be greatly missed.  Judge Otaka was appointed to the bench of  the Illinois Supreme Court in 2000. In 2002,  she was elected as the first Asian-American to  be Cook County Judge, serving in the children  protection court. While  that accomplishment  was extraordinary, it was just one of many exemplary moments in her career.  Born  the daughter and granddaughter of  Japanese Americans who were imprisoned in  U.S. internment camps during World War II,  Sandra Otaka dedicated her life to fighting for  justice. As a child, she campaigned against  the Vietnam War. During college, she worked  at a law firm that successfully overturned the  conviction of Fred Korematsu, a Japanese-  American imprisoned in 1944 for failing to report to an internment camp. Throughout her  adult  life, she worked  tirelessly  to represent  those who too often had no voice.  Judge Otaka was an inspiration not only to  Asian-Americans in Chicago, but to legions of  others,  including me.  I  loved and respected  her deeply not only for her brilliant mind, but  for her tremendous heart. The outpouring of  sorrow and the sense of loss are a testament  to Sandra’s gift  for befriending people and  touching  their  lives  in ways big and small.  While all of us who were Sandra’s friends will  miss her terribly, we can find some comfort in  our memories of  that beautiful, vibrant and  vital woman whom we were so  fortunate  to  have in our lives, albeit for too brief a time.  My heart goes out today to her beloved son  Jeffrey. Jeffrey was the center of Sandra’s life  and she was absolutely devoted to him. She  talked about him and his accomplishments  often, and Sandra always had a photo ready  to share. I also extend my condolences to her  sister Susan, and all of Sandra’s family and  friends whom she loved dearly and who loved  her in return. Judge Otaka made our community and our nation a better place. I and so  many people in Chicago are indeed fortunate  to have had her in our lives.  f  IN HONOR OF THE 2009 LITERACY  COUNCIL  OF  NORTHERN  VIRGINIA AWARD RECIPIENTS  HON. GERALD E.

1048,134,2009-06-18,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the recipients of  the 2009 Literary Council of Northern Virginia  Awards.  Founded  in 1962, The Literary Council of  Northern Virginia  is a non-profit educational  organization that recruits and trains volunteers  to teach adults who need help reading, writing,  speaking and understanding the English language.  The Literacy Council provides a wide range  of programs  including programs  for English  speaking adults who need help with reading  and writing, ESOL programs for those in our  community for whom English is not their native  language and Family Learning Programs  to  teach English proficiency to parents and their  children who are between the ages of two and  12.  Each year, The Literacy Council of Northern  Virginia  recognizes a  few of  its outstanding  adult  learners, volunteers and/or community  partners. This year, a special award will be  given  to student essay contest winners,  the  theme of which was ‘‘Hope for the Future’’. It  is my great honor to recognize the following  recipients of  the 2009 Literacy Council of  Northern Virginia Awards:  Recipients  of  the  Community  Partners  Awards are: Alexandria Community Trust, The  Wish You Well Foundation, and the Richard  Byrd Library (Fairfax County).  Recipients of  the Volunteer of  the Year  Awards are: Kay Habeger, Michael Wolff and  Monica Simone.  Recipients of  the Student Essay Contest  Awards are: Jieun Jang, Albert Costanzo, Wei  Yang Tsai, Gloria Cruz, Hala Elnoby, and  Deepa Kulkarni.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me in recognizing the contributions of The  Literacy Council of Northern Virginia and congratulating each of the 2009 Award recipients.  Their dedication, hard work and commitment  improves the quality of life for the students as  well as the community by providing the program participants with the life skills that are  necessary to become an active and productive  member of society.  f  RECOGNIZING THE MAYOR J.

1049,134,2009-06-18,Mr. PATRICK J.," MURPHY of Pennsylvania.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor J. Robert Hunsicker. He has served  the  town of  Perkasie, Pennsylvania as Mayor for the past  decade.  A  lifelong  resident  of  Perkasie, Mayor  Hunsicker has been active in his community  for years. He grew up working for his father’s  butter and egg business  in  town, and graduated from Sell-Perk High school in 1945. He  served as a Justice of the Peace from 1955 to  1969, and then as a district justice from 1970  until his retirement to a senior judge position  in 1993. In this role, the Mayor had the opportunity to serve on most courts in Bucks County.  Described by colleagues as Perkasie’s biggest fan and loudest cheerleader, the Mayor  has been a champion for the many programs  that represent his hometown. This includes the  Perkasie Park System, where  free arts and  cultural events are held weekly during  the  summer months. One of Mayor Hunsicker’s  dreams has been the construction of a new  band shell in which to house these community  events. During his  time  in office,  the Mayor  has also partnered with the neighboring town  of Sellersville to oversee the successful merging of the towns’ two police departments.  Mayor Hunsicker will retire later this month  in order to enjoy some well-deserved time with  his six children and six grandchildren, and will  of course  remain  involved  in  the Perkasie  community. Madam Speaker,  I ask  that you  join me  in  recognizing Mayor  J. Robert  Hunsicker for his admirable lifelong service. I  am honored  to serve as his Congressman.  Congratulations on  the dedication of  their  headquarters today.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. ZACH WAMP  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 18, 2009  ",2009

1051,141,2009-06-18,Mr. MEEK  of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  today I rise to congratulate Bishop Eustace S.  Clarke and the members of Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy on their new sanctuary. Bishop Clarke  led his congregation  in  celebrating  the achievement of  this beloved  church, which has become a citadel of faith in  the Miami-Dade County community.  In 1922, Miami Ridgeway Church of God of  Prophecy began in a small community called  Nazarene in the Northeast area of Miami, Florida. Their first pastor was the late Evangelist  Andrew Bullard. He was then succeeded by  the late Bishop J.R. Smith who served as pastor until 1930. During the mid-1930s, Brother  Ed Rolle served as pastor until the late Bishop  J.R. Smith  returned and served again until  1939. Other pastors throughout the history of  Miami Ridgeway Church of God of Prophecy  include: the late Brother Hermis Ferguson, late  Bishop Henry Curtis,  late Bishop Theophilus  Hunter, late Bishop J.D. Williams, Bishop R.B.  Davis, and Bishop George H. Knowles.  In 1983, Bishop Eustace S. Clarke,  the  present pastor, joined the Church’s family. A  Jamaican native, Bishop Clarke came to the  United States as a migrant worker  for  the  Belle Glade, Florida Sugar Cane Corporation.  Bishop Clarke married his wife, Mrs. Emily  Clarke on March 25, 1962. After nearly 47  years of marital bliss, Bishop Clarke and his  wife are blessed with 14 children. Bishop  Clarke has remained the pastor for the past  26 years.  While serving at Miami Ridgeway Church of  God of Prophecy,  in 1999 Bishop Clarke  began to follow through with his vision for a  larger sanctuary. Groundbreaking for this endeavor began  in 2000. Though  there were  many obstacles and unforeseen delays,  the  Church will  now  dedicate  their  completed  ‘‘House for God’’ on June 28, 2009.  Madam Speaker, please join me in applauding and  congratulating Bishop Eustace S.  Clarke and the members of Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy on their new sanctuary. Miami Ridgeway Church of God of  Prophecy has been dedicated  to providing  spirituality,  service  and  guidance  to  the  Church and greater community of South Florida.  It  is my hope  that Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy continues to stand  as a beacon of resolve, inspiration and worship for many years to come.  f  COMMERCE,  JUSTICE,  SCIENCE,  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009  SPEECHOF  HON. ADAM SMITH  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 16, 2009  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2847) making appropriations  for the Department of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related  Agencies  for  the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes:  ",2009
1052,141,2009-06-18,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Chair, I rise  today in support of H.R. 2847, and in appreciation of the work done by the Chairman and  Ranking Member on this appropriations bill. I  want to take a moment to speak to a provision  included in the bill’s accompanying report regarding methamphetamines.  I have heard from members of the law enforcement community in my district about the  range of difficulties  that  they have encountered with the efficiency and effectiveness of  the logbook requirement of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA). As you  know Mr. Chairman, pharmacies are required  to keep a record of the sale of various over-  the-counter pharmaceuticals, due to their use  in the production of illicit drugs such as meth.  This record is meant to ensure that individuals  do not purchase excessive amounts of specific  pharmaceuticals in a set period of time.  Unfortunately, there is a wide assortment of  methods used to meet this requirement. Some  pharmacies utilize an electronic record system  while others have a paper logbook to record  purchase information. Further, there is no way  for pharmacies in a geographic area to share  information from their logbooks, which allows  individuals  purchasing  meth  ingredients,  known as ‘‘smurfers,’’ to easily go from one  pharmacy  to another, purchasing  the maximum amount of product from each store.  The inconsistencies of the logbook requirement make it very difficult for law enforcement  agents to investigate drug-related activities in  a timely and effective manner.  This legislation contains a reporting requirement for the Department of Justice to explain  its strategy for dealing with illicit methamphetamine production and to make recommendations on how the CMEA can be strengthened  or expanded to improve the Department’s ability to identify and apprehend those engaged in  the illegal production and distribution of meth,  and other  illicit drugs,  in our communities.  I  am grateful that Committee has agreed to include this report provision and look forward to  working with the Chairman to ensure this report specifically  takes  into consideration  the  logbook requirement and ways on which that  requirement can be improved to assist the law  enforcement community with their difficult task.  Again,  I  thank  the Chairman and Ranking  Member for their work on this bill and look forward to supporting its passage.  f  HONORING  THE  MEMORY  OF  FRANK  EIKENBURG,  FORMER  LEGISLATOR  HON. RALPH M. HALL  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 18, 2009  ",2009
1053,141,2009-06-18,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Madam Speaker, I am  honored to pay tribute to Frank Eikenburg of  Dallas, TX, devoted member of  the Republican Party and my good friend, who passed  away June 4th at the age of 64.  Mr. Eikenburg was a respected member of  the Texas House of Representatives  from  1980 until he chose not to seek re-election in  1984. He was a respected leader in the Republican Party, and his contributions  to  the  State were generous. He was known as a kind  and honest man, unafraid to stand up for his  beliefs. He was always able to find the humor  in life.  Along with his service to the State of Texas  in  the Texas House of Representatives, Mr.  Eikenburg was appointed by Governor Bill  Clements to serve on the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles  from 1989 until 1991. He  spent the later years of his life as a political  consultant, striving to uphold the conservative  values he believed would make the country a  better place.  Born July 7, 1944 in Wellington, TX, the son  of  Frank  and  Margaret  Eikenburg,  Mr.  Eikenburg was a true Texan born and bred.  He grew up in Dallas where he graduated in  1962 from Woodrow Wilson High School and  obtained his Bachelor’s degree from what is  now Texas Tech University in 1966. His passion to serve his country, along with his leadership ability, was shown  in his early years  through his service in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War. He was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant in 1967.  He is survived by his daughter Constance  Emily  Eikenburg  of  Dallas,  two  sisters  Madelyn Brooks of Dallas and Livonia Gay  Glaves of Houston,  sisters-in-law Elizabeth  Eikenburg and Beth Eikenburg, and many  nieces and nephews.  He leaves behind a legacy of service and  commitment to conservative principles, and I  ask  those here  today  to  join me  in remembering  this outstanding American, Mr. Frank  Eikenburg.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

1055,10,2009-07-06,Mr. DEMINT.," I also want to make a  point about the unfortunate expense  associated with these design corrections.  I regret these  funds must be  spent. That the historical whitewash of  the original design contained these inaccuracies was unfortunate, certainly.  But the $150,000 this project will cost is  less than 1/10th of 1 percent of the cost  of the Capitol Visitor Center. Anyone  interested in finding offsets can count  on my support in identifying waste in  the underlying bill that is funding Congress  for  next  year. When  these  engravings are completed and when we  can welcome God back into the Capitol  Visitor Center, visitors to the Capitol  will see a fairer and more historically  accurate depiction of the all-important  relationship between faith and freedom  in America.

1058,10,2009-07-06,Mr. DEMINT.," Madam President,  I  have another amendment I have been  informed the majority plans to block  consideration of, which is No. 1367 regarding transparency at the Federal  Reserve. I wish nonetheless to take a  few moments to discuss it.  ",2009
1059,10,2009-07-06,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  ",2009
1060,10,2009-07-06,Mr. DEMINT.," The unelected central  bank of the United States, the Federal  Reserve, enjoys a monopoly over the  flow of our money and credit but has  never been completely transparent and  accountable to Congress since its crePAUL ation in 1913. Since 1913, our dollar has  lost more than 95 percent of its purchasing  power. My  amendment  is  called  the Federal Reserve  sunshine  amendment. It is modeled after legislation sponsored by Representative RON  of Texas in the House and our  colleague Senator SANDERSof Vermont  in the Senate. This amendment amends  section 714 of title 31 of the United  States Code to remove existing restrictions on how the Government Accountability Office can audit the Federal Reserve. With these limitations gone, the  Fed’s discount window operation, funding facilities, open market operations,  and agreements with  foreign central  banks and governments would all be finally open to congressional oversight.  The Government Accountability Office  would be required to audit the Fed by  the end of 2010 and to report its findings to Congress.  Every dollar created by the Fed has  an effect on the value of the dollars in  our pockets and bank accounts. We  need to pay more attention to the effect of Washington decisions, whether  fiscal policy made by Congress or monetary policy made by the Fed. They all  are ultimately borne by the American  people. The Federal Reserve will create  and disburse trillions of dollars in response to our current financial crisis.  Americans across the Nation, regardless of their opinion on the bailout,  want to know where the money has  gone,  exactly  how much  has  been  spent, and what collateral has been  taken in return. That is why we see so  much bipartisan support in the House,  and JIMDEMINT  being on the same side in the Senate.  Inflation is a hidden tax. We, unfortunately, forget about it too often when  we are debating spending bills in Congress.  Our fiscal actions, higher deficits, increased  long-term debt, and entitlement obligations will necessarily need  to be paid for by printing new money  or borrowing more money from an increasingly skeptical world. Either option results in higher interest rates for  consumers and a devaluing of the dollars  they have  already  earned  and  saved. Allowing the Fed to operate our  Nation’s monetary system  in almost  complete secrecy leads to abuse, inflation, and a lower quality of life for  every American. Unfortunately,  the  majority has decided to use a procedural tactic to block a vote on this  amendment  by  invoking  something  called rule XVI. This is a rule that prevents policy being added to spending  bills. The majority claims we do not  legislate on appropriations bills. Of  course, that is false. In fact, there are  already rule XVI violations in the bill  we are trying to amend. We saw this  majority airdrop the cash for clunkers  program into the recent supplemental  appropriations bill.  The majority may claim this amendment is not relevant to the underlying  bill, but in fact there are already provisions in this bill related to Government  in BERNIE SANDERS Accountability Office audits, so this  language is quite appropriate on this  bill. The  legislation has already received the support of more than one-  half of the House of Representatives  within a few short months of its introduction. It is time for the Senate to  show its support.  I ask the majority leader again to  allow a vote on amendment 1367 regarding a GAO audit of the Federal Reserve.  I call up amendment 1367.  ",2009
1061,10,2009-07-06,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, the clerk will report.  The legislative clerk read as follows:  The Senator  from South Carolina  [Mr.  DEMINT] proposes an amendment numbered  1367 to amendment No. 1365.

1067,3,2009-07-14,Mr. CHILDERS.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to honor the life of an American hero, a Mississippi hero, Master  Sergeant Steve Hood of the Mississippi  Highway Patrol. On May 29 of this  year,  Master  Sergeant  Hood  of  Guntown, Mississippi, died in the line  of duty, the first in a decade. A 28-year  veteran State trooper, he passed before  his time.  Master Sergeant Hood started his career as a State trooper in 1982 after  graduating from the Mississippi Highway Patrol Academy. It was clear when  I attended his funeral last month, he  was a man who brought comfort and  friendship to all he met.  Along with his dedicated service to  the people of Mississippi, family and  friends will remember him as a Christian who was actively involved in Harrisburg Baptist Church and one who enjoyed singing. Just last year, Master  Sergeant Hood returned to duty after  recovering  from a near-fatal tractor  accident that reaffirmed and strengthened his faith.  Master Sergeant Hood was a devoted  husband to his wife, Lisa, and a loving  father to his children, Matthew, Stacie  and Stephanie, and a loyal colleague of  his fellow troopers.  Please join me today in remembering  the life of Master Sergeant Steve Hood  and mourning his death. I thank my  colleagues for honoring this Mississippi  and American hero, Master Sergeant  Steve Hood, and his  family at this  time.  f  ENSURE BROADCAST FREEDOM  ",2009

1069,3,2009-07-14,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker,  the  American people love a fair fight; and  so do I, especially where the issues of  the day are being debated. In a free  market, though, fairness should always  be determined based upon the equality  of opportunity, not equality of results.  Everyone  should,  in  effect, have  a  chance to make their case.  That’s why  it  is so disturbing to  many of us that some of the leading  voices in Congress over the last 2 years  have been calling for Congress to enforce an idea of fairness on the airwaves of America in the form of restoring the so-called fairness doctrine. But  our Nation should always proceed with  caution whenever some would achieve  fairness by limiting the fairness of others.  The American people cherish their  freedom. It is, in effect, a blood-bought  right. There is totality of agreement  on this floor about that. In fact, I believe  that  is why President Ronald  Reagan repealed the so-called fairness  doctrine after it had been in place for  almost four decades back in 1987. The  fairness doctrine regulated the content  of radio for much of the last century,  and limited the ability of radio stations to deal with controversial issues  without meeting a standard of equal  time or balance or record keeping. As a  result of  that, as many of us old  enough to remember will attest, talk  radio as we know it today virtually did  not exist before 1987.  Well, with some of the talk of restoring the fairness doctrine to the law of  the land, Congressman GREGWALDEN  of Oregon and I have been working over  the last 2 years to ensure broadcast  freedom. We have authored the Broadcaster Freedom Act which is cosponsored by every Republican in the House  of Representatives. This week we will  bring to the floor a broadcaster freedom amendment as part of the Financial Services Appropriations bill. Many  who are watching may not know that  the Federal Communications Commission receives its entire budget through  the Financial Services Appropriations  bill, and we believe this is an opportune time, as we were able to do 2  years ago, to use the power of this Congress and the people in this Congress  on both sides of the aisle to advocate  for  the  freedom of  the airwaves of  America by limiting the ability of the  Federal Communications Commission  to bring back the so-called  fairness  doctrine.  But  first,  for the uninformed, the  fairness doctrine is something of an Orwellian  and Depression-era  Federal  Communications Commission rule that  was devised back in 1949. As I mentioned, it required radio broadcasters  to present both sides of an opinion  when discussing controversial topics. It  put unelected bureaucrats at the FCC  in  charge of  enforcement  in determining what speech was legal. Because  of lack of clarity in the commission’s  ruling, broadcasters more often than  not opted  to offer noncontroversial  programs in lieu of hours of paperwork,  countless  legal  fees, and a potential  threat to their broadcast license.  Recognizing the chilling effect the  regulation was having on broadcast  freedom, the FCC began to overturn its  own ruling on the fairness doctrine in  1985. Following that change in policy  and President Reagan’s veto of attempts to reinstate it, the results have  been dramatic.  Think about it. Before the fairness  doctrine was repealed, there were some  125 talk radio stations in America. Now  there are more than 2,000. While names  like  Limbaugh,  Hanity,  Laura  Ingraham, and other conservative giants are better known to many, the  truth is when you look at the totality  of the talk radio marketplace, from the  local level to the regional level to the  national  level,  there  is an extraordinary diversity of opinion. Many progressive, moderate, and  liberal programs succeed extraordinarily well at  the local level in many markets around  the country.  Unfortunately, in spite of this recent  history and the breakout of broadcast  freedom since 1987, there has been talk  in the last several years about the need  to  level  the playing  field of  radio  broadcasting by restoring the fairness  doctrine. Let me say from my heart, I  believe it is dangerous to suggest that  a government bureaucracy would be a  competent arbiter of free speech. As a  former radio talk show host myself, I  know personally what the fairness doctrine meant to radio back in the day,  and I know it would ultimately muzzle  what is the dynamic public discussion  that we call talk radio  in America  today.  Let me be clear on this. I believe the  broadcaster freedom amendment that  we will bring this week gives Members  of this body an opportunity to say  ‘‘no’’ to the fairness doctrine and to  say ‘‘no’’ to a new iteration of it that  takes  the  formation  of  regulations  under the rubric of localism, I believe  will be met by broad and bipartisan  support. If memory serves, 2 years ago  when I brought the Pence amendment  banning  the  fairness  doctrine  from  being implemented by the FCC, more  than 305 Members of Congress voted for  it, including 100 Members of the Democrat majority.  So I urge support for the broadcaster  freedom amendment. Join us  in embracing  freedom on the airwaves of  America.  f  65TH ANNIVERSARY OF  LIBERATION OF GUAM  ",2009

1075,10,2009-07-14,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to thank the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee  on Economic Opportunity of  the Veterans’ Committee,  STEPHANIEHERSETHSANDLINof South  Dakota, for introducing this bill, the  Pilot College Work Study Programs for  Veterans Act of 2009. It would direct  the VA  to  conduct  a  5-year  pilot  project  to expand on existing work  study activities for student veterans to  participate in work study positions in  academic departments and in student  services.  As this committee’s chairman and a  former university professor, I understand the financial hurdles of paying  for college and strongly support all  methods to make education more affordable for our brave veterans.  This  legislation provides an additional avenue for student veterans to  help pay for college and places them on  a par with other students in the same  financial situation. Furthermore, these  new work study positions would provide student veterans with much needed job skills that they can use in their  professional career.  Our  chairwoman, Ms.  HERSETHSANDLIN, will be speaking on  this bill, and I urge all our colleagues  to join me in reaffirming our country’s  commitment to our veterans by supporting this H.R. 1037.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1077,10,2009-07-14,Ms. HERSETH  SANDLIN.," The Pilot College Work Study  Program for Veterans Act of 2009 would  expand the number and types of work  study positions at colleges and universities.  The types of work study jobs that  can be funded through the Montgomery  GI Bill are too restrictive. Expanding  the types of jobs veterans may hold at  schools benefits student veterans  financially, but more importantly, in my  view, it places them in positions where  nonveteran students and faculty will  see the advantages and results of military service to the Nation. Too often  STEPHANIE  our young people see only the entitlement side of life that requires no commitment  to  something  other  than  themselves.  Just as the original GI Bill opened  higher education to the masses of citizen soldiers after World War II, improved the experiences of all students,  including nonveterans,  this bill will  broaden  the  impact  on  veterans  throughout the Nation’s higher educational system.  I am reminded of the statement by  James B. Conant, president of Harvard  University,  shortly after  the World  War II generation filled the campuses.  In recanting his earlier concerns, he  stated, and I quote: The mature student body that filled our colleges in  1946 and 1947 was a delight to all who  were teaching undergraduates. For seriousness,  perceptiveness,  and  studiousness and all other undergraduate  virtues, the former soldiers and sailors  were the best in Harvard’s history.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1037, as amended,  will provide our veterans on campus a  unique opportunity to earn while they  learn, to build their resumes and to influence  campus  life. Too often our  young citizens see a distorted image of  veterans, and this bill will help replace  that image with one of men and woman  who are dedicated to education and to  making meaningful contributions  to  society.  By enlarging the types of work study  jobs veterans can hold on campus, we  are putting them in the forefront of  student life. As teaching assistants, administrative staff, student counselors,  and  other high-visibility  jobs, nonveteran students and faculty will see  them just as Harvard President Conant  did over 60 years ago.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

I rise in support of H.R. 469 honoring the  life  of  basketball  star  and  jazz musician  Wayman Tisdale and expressing condolences  to his family on his death.  Today, we honor Wayman Tisdale, for his  life accomplishments and  for his demonstration of positive thinking, particularly in the last  couple of years of his life as he battled cancer.  Mr. Tisdale’s  inspirational and enthusiastic  way in which he lived his life serves as an example  for us all. He was a star basketball  player, showing a profound gift for the sport  during his time at Oklahoma University in the  mid-1980s. He is considered an OU basketball  legend, having been a three-time All-American  during his time at the university and was OU’s  all-time leader in scoring and field goal percentage. Mr. Tisdale was a member of  the  men’s basketball team in the 1984 Olympics  and assisted in their gold medal win.  He went on to be the second overall pick in  the 1985 NBA Draft by  the  Indiana Pacers,  and played for a total of 12 NBA seasons for  the Pacers,  the Sacramento Kings, and  the  Phoenix Suns until his  retirement  from  the  NBA in 1997.  Though his professional basketball career  came to an end at that point, Mr. Tisdale did  not, in any sense, slow down. He continued to  participate in basketball camps for youngsters.  He also became known as a talented jazz musician, releasing his  first CD  in 1995, which  achieved the Number four spot on Billboard’s  Contemporary Jazz chart and also gained a  spot on the R&B charts. His subsequent albums were also successful, with many earning  spots on Billboard’s Top 10.  Mr. Tisdale’s accomplishments in his life are  a reflection of his motivational frame of mind.  He was noted and admired  for his positive  thinking, even after he was diagnosed with  bone cancer in 2007. The diagnosis led to surgeries and eventually  the amputation of his  right leg, but Mr. Tisdale never lost his positive  outlook.  Sadly, Mr. Tisdale passed away suddenly  on May 15, 2009. Though he has  left  this  world, he will forever be remembered for the  optimistic and confident manner in which he  led his life and, by example, encouraged us to  do the same.  In a press interview in June of 2008, he said  ‘‘You go through things. You don’t change because things come in your life. You get better  because things come in your life.’’  Many people can attest that they are better  for having had Mr. Tisdale as a role model  and a part of their lives. I rise today and ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Tisdale and expressing our condolences  to his  family  in his passing by supporting H. Res.  469.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2009

Handy, Bessie Smith,  Lena Horne, Charlie Parker, Lionel Hampton, Max Roach, Billie Holiday, Count Basie,  Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis,  Etta James, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus,  Thelonious Monk, Wynton Marsalis, Louis  Armstrong,  Professor  Longhair,  James  Booker, the Neville Brothers, Muddy Waters,  Albert King and B.B.

And  I congratulate them on the introduction of this legislation, and I certainly  support it. And I think it’s very laudable that we are bringing this forward,  and I very much support it.

And I  congratulate you and my friends on the  other side for bringing this forward.  I am also concerned about the submersion though of the American taxpayer in just a sea of debt. We have  created more debt  in this Congress,  this administration has proposed more  debt over the next 5 years than has  been created by every  single Presidency since George Washington all the  way through George W. Bush. And the  American people are drowning in a sea  of debt, and we are creating more and  more debt for those people. We are robbing  our  children  and  our  grandchildren of their future. The American  people are going to  live at a  lower  standard than we live today because of  the debt that we are creating, and I am  very concerned about that.  We have got to stop the spending. It’s  egregious.  It’s absolutely outrageous  the amount of money  that’s being  spent by this Congress. And we see bill  after bill, a nonstimulus bill, an omnibus bill, a Wall Street bailout that our  previous administration brought to us  and that this Congress and this administration continued and spent the other  half.  We have a health care bill that’s  being  introduced  just  today  that  is  going to create more debt, and  it’s  going to destroy the health care system and put a Washington bureaucrat  between patients and their doctor. And  Washington bureaucrats are going to  be making health care decisions  for  their patients. And the American people need to stand up and say ‘‘no.’’ It’s  going to overwhelm them, a tremendous sea of debt that’s being created by  this Congress, and it has to stop.  And, Mr. Speaker, I just hope that  the American people will understand  what’s going on here and will rise up,  call their Congressman, call their two  U.S. Senators and say  ‘‘no’’ to this  health care bill that’s being introduced  today.  ‘‘No’’ to the tax and cap, so-  called cap-and-trade bill that’s nothing  but a revenue bill that’s not about the  environment. Say ‘‘no’’ to that. ‘‘No’’  to this continued tsunami of spending  that’s going on here.  We’ve got a spending addiction here  in Congress. I’m an addictionologist.  I’ve practiced addiction medicine  in  my family practice. In addiction medicine, we say where there is not denial  there is not an addiction. Congress has  an addiction, a spending addiction, and  they are denying it. We are denying it,  and the spending has to stop.  ",2009

1096,24,2009-07-14,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  in strong support of H.R. 934, recognizing  the Commonwealth of  the Northern  Mariana Islands’ (CNMIs’) ownership of submerged  lands  lying  three geographical miles  outside of mainland coastlines.  First and foremost, I want to commend my  good  friend, Congressman SABLAN of  the  Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana  Islands, for taking the initiative to introduce this  important legislation. This bill is an example of  the continued efforts by the Congress to support the Territories.  H.R. 934 seeks to officially award the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana  Islands  submerged lands that are located three geographical miles outside of mainland coastlines.  Submerged  lands qualify as  lands permanently or periodically covered by tidal waters  up  to, but not above,  the  line of high  tide.  American Samoa, Guam, and  the Virgin  Islands were granted ownership over our own  respective submerged lands by the 93rd session of  the Congress, before  the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana  Islands became a  territory of  the United States. The  CNMI wishes to be afforded the same opportunities granted to the other territories by having  these submerged  lands officially  recognized as a part of their Territory.  Mr. Speaker, by allowing these submerged  lands to be recognized, they will fall under the  jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as opposed to that of the  U.S. Seeing as the submerged lands are located so closely to the mainland, having them  fall within  the  jurisdiction of  the CNMI will  allow for sufficient justice to be served. Commonwealth citizens and officials, instead of officials residing thousands of miles away, will  be implementing and enforcing laws that apply  to their population.  The U.S. government will still have claim  over gas, oil, and other mineral deposits that  may be possibly  found on  these  lands.  It  should be noted that H.R. 934 applies solely  to those lands that are submerged; the U.S.  government will still have full control and possession of lands above sea level that do not  belong to the Commonwealth. Additionally, it  does not circumvent any actions that may be  taken or regulations that have been put forth  by U.S. naval authorities regarding these submerged lands.  It is apparent that H.R. 934 serves to benefit  the Commonwealth of the Northern Marina Islands and will not be detrimental to the United  States. For  these  reasons,  I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 934. Again, I thank my  colleagues for their support of this legislation.  ",2009

1104,31,2009-07-14,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  129 was  introduced by our colleague  from California, Representative ELTON  GALLEGLY. The bill would authorize  the Forest Service to sell 5 acres of  land within the Los Padres National  Forest  to  resolve  an  encroachment  issue. A portion of a small business  owned by the White Lotus Foundation  sits on 5 acres of the national forest.  The 5 acres in question are separated  from the majority of the forest by a  road. The foundation was unaware of  the encroachment when it purchased  the land. Under the terms of the legislation,  the White Lotus Foundation  will be responsible for all the costs associated with the conveyance, including any necessary reviews under the  National Environmental Policy Act.  Mr. Speaker, we support passage of  this measure.  I reserve the balance of my time.  b1515  Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  H.R. 129 corrects a problem resulting  from the way a small section of the Los  Padres  National  Forest  boundary  crosses an old road. This road provides  the only access to property owned by  the White Lotus Foundation. This bill  authorizes the Secretary to sell five  acres to the foundation and requires  that the sale be accomplished at no  cost to the taxpayers.  I support the bill and reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1107,31,2009-07-14,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, first  of all, I want to thank the gentlelady  from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO), my good  friend, for her work on this; and I rise  today in strong support of H.R. 129.  This bill would authorize the Forest  Service to convey a small parcel of  land on the perimeter of the Los Padres National Forest to a nonprofit organization, the White Lotus Foundation. In 1983, the White Lotus Foundation  inherited property  in  the hills  above Santa Barbara, California, on  the border of Los Padres National Forest. After operating in the location for  over 25 years, the Forest Service sent a  letter to the White Lotus Foundation  notifying them of a parcel that was 0.05  acres, just a few actual square feet, of  encroachment on the Forest Service  land. It required them to remove all  encroachments by December 31, 2008, or  they would begin enforcement action.  The encroachment in question is located on a loop of the only road that  RAHALL,  allows White Lotus and the rest of the  public access to and from the White  Lotus property. Due to the steep topography, the foundation has no other reasonable alternatives.  The loop lies on flat ground which  was held for the purpose of providing  space  for equipment storage  for  fire  and flood emergencies and provided access to a water pump and other necessary equipment. There is no other  flat ground on which to move these  items, and without  this  space,  the  foundation would be forced to cease operations.  My legislation will not cost the taxpayers a single penny. The White Lotus  Foundation will pay for the land, the  survey, and all administrative costs.  There are no exemptions from NEPA or  other environmental laws. The land in  question is not protected by wilderness  or any other  specifically designated  area.  Finally, my legislation does not even  mandate  this  land be  conveyed.  It  merely allows the Forest Service to  convey the land and to determine the  amount to be conveyed; meaning, if the  Forest Service does not feel this land  conveyance is in its best interest, it  does not have to sell any Federal land  to the White Lotus Foundation.  In closing, I want to thank the chairman,  Chairman  Ranking  Member Mr. HASTINGS,  for allowing  this legislation to be considered today;  and I urge support of this legislation,  H.R. 129.  ",2009

1110,31,2009-07-14,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank my friend, Mr. BROWN from  South Carolina, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation and want  to  remind  the  American public, Mr. Speaker,  if  I  could speak to them, that we have a  tremendous Federal debt and deficit  that’s growing every moment that this  Congress is in session.  We have a tremendous amount of resources all across this country in forests, in Federal property; and I believe  we must be good stewards of our environment.  It’s absolutely critical.  In  fact, we are charged from a biblical  perspective to be good stewards of our  environment, and  I am a conservationist of the  first order. In  fact, I  began my political activism being involved in the conservation movement.  I’m a life member of many conservation movements such as the Wild Sheep  Foundation,  the Safari Club  International, where I was a political action  vice president, political affairs vice  president for Safari Club International.  I’m  a member  of Quail Unlimited,  I  Ducks Unlimited, and I can go on and  on. So my conservation credentials are  very numerous.  But we have Federal property all  over this country where the Federal  Government is not managing it properly. The Park Service can’t take care,  by their own admission, of the Federal  National Park System today. The Forest Service does a much better job than  the Park Service does in managing its  properties. But we have national forests all over this country that have  timber growing. It’s a renewable resource.  Mr. Speaker, we can handle some of  this Federal deficit and debt by starting to manage these Federal properties  in a more responsible, scientific manner that will not harm the environment, will not harm the properties,  will not harm—actually will help the  wildlife.  So, Mr. Speaker, as I rise to support  this legislation, I ask this House, I ask  this Congress, I ask the American people to start demanding good management  practices  of  our  natural  resources, and that’s going to  include  good, responsible wildlife management;  that’s  going  to  include  considering  hunting on all Federal properties as a  management tool which is absolutely  critical in proper wildlife management.  So, Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support  of this legislation. I assume that it will  pass, and I hope that it does. But we  need to  look beyond that and start  being good stewards of our environment, and we have not been.  ",2009

Improving the relationship between  the United States and Cuba is something I strongly support, but I do not  support this partnership at any cost.  I must ask, what has Cuba done?  Cuba is still imprisoning political dissidents; Cuba still denies gay and lesbian citizens basic rights like freedom  of assembly; Cuba still forbids travel  outside the country without official  permission.

1123,45,2009-07-14,Mr. HIMES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House this afternoon because,  like so many Members of this body, I  am engaged in a terribly important exercise of working to think through the  next generation of regulation that will  oversee the stability and health of our  financial services sector. This is a terribly important and challenging thing  that we do. We need to make sure that  we do what is necessary to have a vibrant,  innovative,  thriving  financial  services sector that employs the people  of Connecticut and the people of this  Nation, that pays taxes in Connecticut  and to this Nation, but that we toe the  line in such a way that we never find  ourselves in the position that we are in  today of tens and hundreds of billions  of taxpayer dollars being brought to  the table to bail out a private industry  that took too many risks.  And I rise this evening because I am  concerned  by  the  conclusion  being  drawn by some of the Members of this  House, because our regulatory apparatus which, let’s face it, was crafted in  the 1930s, failed in many respects. And,  boy, did it fail in some spectacular aspects. The  conclusion  seems  to  be  drawn that government cannot regulate, that we should get out of the business, that we should leave the financial  services sector entirely to its own devices, that somehow individual responsibility alone will create a stable and  vibrant financial services sector.  And so I want to hearken back to the  history of this body and this government crafting smart regulation. Think  back 110, 120 years ago. American families ate rotten food. They bought snake  oil  in the guise of pharmaceuticals.  They worked in factories that burned  down and killed hundreds. They lived  in cities that were unsanitary.  And over 120 years, 110 years, maybe  starting with  the  fine Republican,  Teddy Roosevelt, this Nation said we  can do better. We can put  in place  smart regulation that protects our citizens and that adds to the quality of life  of every American family. And, in fact,  that is what happened, and we haven’t  gotten it quite right. There have been  spectacular failures. But over that 120  years, the efforts of this government to  craft smart, efficient regulation hasn’t  destroyed the economy.  The economic growth in this country  over that period of time has been nothing short of spectacular. But it has protected American  families. Very  few  families anymore buy snake oil, buy  securities that would put Madoff’s securities  to  shame,  find  themselves  working in factories that burn down  and nobody gets out because the doors  are locked. 110 years, 120 years of success, not unadulterated success. There  have been failures. But over time, the  efforts of this country to put in place  smart and efficient  regulation have  helped this economy and have helped  the quality of life of American families.  And that is what we must do. We  must not shrink from the task just because the SEC blew it on the Madoff  case  or  because  other  regulators  weren’t watching new and dangerous  markets closely enough. We must not  shrink  from  the  task  of  thinking  through what new round of financial  regulation  allows  that  industry  to  thrive, allows that industry to provide  credit to American families, to small  businesses, to allow our economy to  grow, but which never, ever puts us in  the kind of risky position that we’re  working so hard to dig ourselves out of  right now.  We can do this. There’s a century-  long tradition of our working constructively in that direction. So I know we  can do this. The answer is smart, efficient, modern regulation for the benefit of everyone and the benefit of this  economy.  f  THE MAJORITY MAKERS AND  HEALTH CARE  ",2009

1125,45,2009-07-14,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, it’s a  great honor for me to be here tonight  to lead a discussion about the most  pressing and the most significant problem to most Americans, and that is the  question of health care. I’m here with  Members of the class of 2006. We call  ourselves  the Majority Makers, and  from time to time we are here to address matters of great national import  with you. But this is a very special  topic for the class of 2006.  I remember very well when I began  my campaign for Congress back then,  in 2006, when many of the headlines of  our Nation’s newspapers and our television news operations were all about  the Iraq war, and people would say to  me, Well, I guess everyone’s talking  about the Iraq war to you. And I said,  No, nobody’s talking about the Iraq  war.  It’s health  care, health  care,  health care. Everywhere I went, neighborhood picnics, Catholic picnics on  Friday  night,  festivals,  businesses,  schools, wherever I went, I heard story  after story about how Americans were  fed up with the health care system that  was not serving them. In fact, it was,  in many cases, killing them.  Well, here we are, 3 years later, and  while health care may not have been  on the front pages of the newspapers up  till now because we have a severe economic decline and many  challenges  we’re dealing with, this Congress  is  ready to put health care back on the  front pages. And President Obama has  already indicated that this is his top  priority in his first time in office, and  the reasons that that is so are not hard  to determine.  It’s pretty easy to look around us,  look at the numbers and see why we  have to take significant, decisive action to improve, to change our health  care system. Just a few weeks ago, Dr.  Christine  Rohmer,  who  heads  the  White House’s economic team, testified  before the House Budget Committee  that if we don’t make significant steps  to reform health care, to get a handle  on cost, to bring prices down, that  health care, which now comprises 17  percent of our economy, by 2040, would  make up 35 percent of our economy.  Well, you don’t have to be an economist or a health care expert to know  that if health care takes up 35 percent  of our economy, it’s going to squeeze  out most of everything else. In short, it  is an unsustainable number. And we  can go on and talk about the dramatic  impact of Medicare and those types of  expenses on the Federal budget as well  as on the general economy.

I chair the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee of Judiciary, and next week  we’re going to have a hearing on bankruptcies and health care. Health care is  the major cause of bankruptcies in this  country, and Elizabeth Edwards will be  one of our witnesses.  But when people go bankrupt because  of high medical bills, then other folks  lose out because they don’t get paid either. Merchants don’t get paid because  of that bankruptcy. So that’s another  cost of not having this health care system, and I want to thank each of you.  ",2009

1128,52,2009-07-14,Mr. KAGEN.," I’d like to dovetail on  both of these conversations and say  that Mr. RYAN from Ohio pointed out  the difference between health  insurance and health care, and what we are  talking about  in this bill  is health  care, getting the care that you need.  You have the choice, you’ve got the  coverage, and you’ve got  the  costs  coming down. That’s exactly what this  bill aims to do.  ",2009
1129,52,2009-07-14,Mr. YARMUTH.," I appreciate all the  comments from my colleagues, and I’d  like to close by reading a letter that I  received  from a constituent of mine  who’s 10 years old.  It  says:  ‘‘Dear  Congressman  Yarmuth,’’ My name is Matthew Gregory, and I am a 10-year-old that lives in  Louisville, Kentucky.  ‘‘I am writing this letter because I  have a younger brother with autism,  and I want you to cosponsor the Autism Treatment Acceleration Act.’’  Not the piece of legislation we’re talking about now, but relevant.  ‘‘I would really appreciate the efforts  you would provide to cosponsor the bill  that would help end autism insurance  discrimination.  My  parents  spend  $50,000 per year for my brother’s autism, and I think it’s a national crisis.  ‘‘It seems like families that have not  had  their State’s  autism  insurance  bills passed have to pay unnecessary  expenses just because a child is different.’’  And here’s the kicker. ‘‘It’s just not  fair, and this is a fair country and everybody, no matter who they are, including my brother Eric,  should be  treated equally.’’  So there you have it. A 10-year-old  understands the essential unfairness of  the system we have now, the fact that  so many people are uninsured, the fact  that so many people pay too much for  the insurance they have, have to make  life decisions based on whether they  can get insurance or not, and that’s  what this Congress is determined to  correct.  We have an historic opportunity here  to create a just, fair health care system, one that is affordable and sustainable for this country and which will  make sure that every American citizen  has the health care he and she needs  for their families well into the future.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  ",2009

1131,52,2009-07-14,Mr. AKIN.," Well, good evening, Mr.  Speaker and my friends. We have just  heard  from  the Democrats  talking  about their new foray into solving all  the problems with health care, and  boy, did it sound good to me. I have to  say it really sounded good.  The promises, essentially what I was  hearing talk about,  first of all, the  costs  are  coming  down  and you’re  going to get free medical care and the  quality of the care is going to go up.  And gosh, if you were given a proposal  like that,  I don’t see why anybody  wouldn’t say, Yeah, let’s just march  right ahead with socialized medicine.  Let’s let the government run it because  they’re going to bring the costs down,  they’re going to give you free medical  care, and you’re going to get even better coverage than you get now.  I also was hearing the fact that they  talked about the muck of our health  care system and how bad the health  care system is, and how, if we don’t immediately pass this  legislation, that  things are going to get even worse. But  what we have in front of us is this absolutely  euphoric  view  of  a  great  health care system.  Well, first thing off that strikes me is  a little bit of a problem with common  sense, the first is, if our health care  system were so bad, then it would seem  like, to me, that Americans would be  going to some foreign country to get  their health care. But what I’m observing is that if I got sick—and I have  been sick—the place that I’d like to be  treated is in good old U.S.A. I don’t  want to go to Canada. I don’t want to  go to Great Britain. I don’t want to go  to France or Sweden. I don’t want to go  to Russia. No, I’d like to be sick right  here in this country.  So it strikes me that a health care  system that most people even around  the world recognize as probably the  most sophisticated and the best quality  health care system in the world, we’re  saying that it is full of muck and that  the  system  has  to  be  completely  changed around.  And so it’s okay if you want to believe these promises, that what’s going  to happen when the government takes  over the health care system is that it’s  going to cost less money. The trouble  is  the Congressional Budget Office  doesn’t say that and the estimates of  the  costs don’t  say  that. And  the  States that have tried using the same  approach that’s being proposed here  nationally, they don’t say that either,  because those States are almost bankrupt for trying to do this kind of a system, and yet, we’re going to try to  copy those bad examples.  We are just actually a few weeks, a  couple, 3 weeks away from dealing with  the other big problem that the administration has identified, which is the  fact that the climate and the Earth is  going to get worse and worse, hotter  and hotter, and we are going to melt  down. So we’ve got to deal with the  problem of global warming by, what  would you expect, a very, very large  tax increase, the largest tax increase in  the history of our country. I guess it  was about $787 billion. That was the  largest tax increase that we’ve done.  We did that.  It was an 1,100-page bill that was  brought to the  floor, and then at 3  o’clock in the morning, in a special  committee hearing, another 300 pages  of extra text were added to the 1,100  pages, and the 300 pages being in the  form of amendments to had to be collated and put into the 1,100 pages. So,  as we were debating this wonderful bill  on the floor, they were busy trying to  collate this amendment that had been  passed,  300-page  amendment,  at  3  o’clock in the morning. They’re busy  trying to collate that. So, as we’re debating it here on the floor about to  take a vote on it, there isn’t even a  copy of the bill that we’re going to  vote on.  So here we go again. Perhaps we did  learn from our last experience that it’s  easier to pass something that people  don’t know what it is. And so here we  go now with about 1,000 pages of bill in  terms of what we’re going to do to have  the government take over 20 percent of  the U.S. economy. The health care  business  is about 20 percent of the  money that’s spent  in America. It’s  about 20 percent, or close to it, of our  economy, and now we’re going to have  the government take—well, if you take  a look at it, about half of it the government’s already running with Medicare  and Medicaid. So we’ve had some experience with the government running  these programs.  The Medicaid program, of course, is  noted for the tremendous amount of  fraud and abuse that it has, but if you  add the Medicaid and Medicare money,  if you take a look at the total money  we spent in health care, government’s  doing about half of it right now, but  we’re talking about having the government do the rest of it. And so that’s  where we’re going, and I think we need  to take a look at that.  When the government does take over  various things, what tends to happen?

1132,59,2009-07-14,Mr. AKIN.," I think that, perhaps, may  be the Democrats’ biggest nightmare—  the fact, if we have time to read the  bill, that the people will see that what  is promised and what the bill says are  two different things. That is certainly  what we’re dealing with here. You have  the Blue Dogs. These are Democrats.  They’re asking their leadership to have  this flexibility, and the bill goes the  exact opposite of what they’re saying.  I would yield to the gentleman from  Michigan, Congressman HOEKSTRA.  ",2009
1133,59,2009-07-14,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," What we’re really  seeing here is a continued erosion of  the rights of individuals and the rights  of States. Michigan is a donor State in  terms of  transportation. What does  that mean? It means, since the inception of the national highway or the national gas tax, for every dollar that  Michigan  has  sent  to Washington,  we’ve  received  83  cents back. That  hardly  seems  fair  to me, especially  when we’re now number one in unemployment. Think of it. When we get  that money back, the Federal Government tells us how to spend  it. The  same thing happened with education.  We sent money here.  Think about what’s going to happen  with health care. It’s going to come  here to Washington, and we’re going to  apportion it back to the States. Some  States are going to do better than others, and it’s not going to be based on  population or those types of things. It’s  going to be based on the power of the  people  in  this Chamber and  in  the  Chamber down the hall as to who has  got the most influence. There are going  to  be  donor States  and—what  are  they?—donees or beneficiaries, the ones  who get more than the rest of us.  ",2009

1140,59,2009-07-14,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the Speaker for recognizing me to address this.  While we have so many stellar experts here on health care, health insurance and on the destiny of America  with regard to this large percentage of  our gross domestic product, I’d ask for  any of you who are willing to stay here  and to continue imparting the knowledge base that you have to continue in  this seamless transition over into the  second hour of the Special Orders here.  It turns out that the Democrats don’t  have enough confidence to show up  here on the floor to defend their position nor to rebut ours, and so I would  point out something that I would add  into this equation.  That is that, first, we have the most  successful health care system in the  world, and it has produced the best results  in the world. Even though we  have a Secretary of Agriculture who,  as the lead person on health care, said  that Cuba had the model for the world.  No, it’s the United States of America.  She got the right hemisphere, and she  was close to the right continent, but  it’s the United States of America.  I’d point out also that, by the time  you reduce down the numbers of the  uninsured, that 44–47 million, which is  a number that is arguable, and by the  time you take out of that those who  are illegal and by the time you take  out of that those who are in transition  between health insurance policies and  by the time you just boil it down to the  chronically uninsured—and this is according to a study done by two professors at Penn State University that was  reproduced by the Heritage Foundation—it comes back to about 4 percent  of this population that is chronically  uninsured. Yet we would upset the entire system of health care in America  to try to reduce that 4 percent number  down to—what?—3 percent or 2 percent  or not even 1 percent in their wildest  aspirations.  So, rather than my venting myself  completely on the things that I have in  my head and heart on this health insurance and health care program, I am  looking at a series of established experts.  I would  like to yield to the gentleman from Missouri to pick up where  he left off before the clock ticked out  on that first hour.  ",2009
1141,59,2009-07-14,Mr. AKIN.," Thank you, Congressman  KING. I appreciate your love for free enterprise and  for your willingness to  stand up for freedom.  We’ve been joined here over the last  hour by a number of distinguished doctors, by doctors who have given a large  portion of their lives to providing good  quality health care—by Dr. ROE from  Tennessee, by Dr. GINGREY from Georgia, who just left, and by Dr. BROUN  from Georgia. They all, of course, know  health care far better than a lot of us  because they’ve lived it for 30 or 40  years of their lives; but there’s something that I’ve lived for about 9 years  of my life, and that’s what is called  cancer.  People in America, when you hear  the word ‘‘cancer’’—they call it ‘‘the  big C’’—you pay attention to it. When  I got here as a freshman Congressman,  I waltzed down to the doctor’s clinic  that’s provided by the Navy  in this  Capitol building. I felt bulletproof and  fit as a fiddle at barely over 50. They  said, Yeah, you’re in pretty good shape  except for one little detail: you’ve got  prostate cancer. So, when you hear the  words ‘‘the big C’’—cancer—pay attention to it. So, although I’m not a doctor, I’ve had some experience.  There was one set of numbers that  jumped out at me that we really didn’t  talk about, although it was mentioned  by the gentleman from Arizona, Congressman SHADEGG. He talked about  prostate cancer and breast cancer, but  let’s generalize those numbers a little  bit more. Let’s  talk about  survival  rates. What we’re talking about here is  that, for the sake of 4 percent of the  people who are chronically uninsured,  the Democrats want to remake the  best health care system in the world  even though they were throwing rocks  at it an hour and a half ago. Nobody  goes from America to get health care  somewhere else. They all come here to  get their health care. Now what they  want to do is turn us into something  like Canada or England or Tennessee,  which had a bad experience, or  like  Massachusetts.

1146,66,2009-07-14,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Reclaiming, I pose  this issue here, but it isn’t true for all  Canadians. And I say this because even  though there’s a law in Canada that  prohibits one from jumping ahead in  the line or having a policy or a plan  that  gives  them  preferential  treatment, they want everybody down at  the bottom.  There are provinces that don’t enforce it equally. So there are places  where people carve out their own special privileges so that those who are  better off have an avenue to better  health care, even though the law says  not. But that’s within the Canadians.  And let them do it.  ",2009

1152,66,2009-07-14,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," I heard just  recently about a patient  in Canada  that had such severe knee pain that he  was having to take narcotics. It took  him over 1 year just to go see an orthopedic surgeon.  If a patient comes to see me and has  knee pain, I pick up the telephone and  call an orthopedic surgeon and I’ll get  them within a week or two. But it took  this patient over 1 year to ever go see  the orthopedic surgeon and to get the x  rays that he needed to evaluate his  knee pain. When he finally saw the orthopedic surgeon, the doctor said, Well,  you need this surgery. And the Canadian said, Well, that’s fine. Let’s schedule it. He said, No, we have to put you  on a wasting list.  So he came—I don’t know if he came  to one of your local hospitals there in  Michigan—but he came to the U.S. to  get his surgery done on his knee. And  that’s exactly what this government  program is going to do to Americans.  But where are we going to go if they  indeed put this into place?  ",2009
1153,66,2009-07-14,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Reclaiming your  time but given to me, what this Wall  Street Journal says: ‘‘Access to a waiting list is not access to health care’’.  Waiting lists are what I hear about  all the time when I’m talking to our  friends across the border. But what I  hear  from  the medical professionals  and the hospitals in Michigan is we  treat the well-to-do Canadians who will  come across the border and access our  health care because they’re unwilling  to be on a waiting list. And they recognize that being on a waiting list isn’t  having your problem taken care of.  If you’ve got to wait for 117 days or  171 days—117 days for a bypass—excuse  me—I think that’s about 112 or 113 days  too long.  ",2009

1156,66,2009-07-14,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Reclaiming my  time, in the brief moment that we have  left I want to make the point that if  the Canadians were protected by constitutional  rights  that we have  as  Americans, they would be protected,  because it’s cruel and inhuman to ask  the Canadians to give up on their access to good health care here in the  United States of America.  You can go on the Web site and you  can  find companies  in Canada  that  have been  formed by  entrepreneurs  that turnkey the package. If you need  a hip replacement in Canada, you can  find a tour company that will set you  up and say, Here’s your flight to Seattle or Detroit or wherever it might  be, or maybe Houston for heart surgery. Here’s the surgeon, here’s the  hotel, here’s the transportation.  ",2009

1159,66,2009-07-14,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, as  I stand here on the floor of the House  tonight and after hearing  this  fine  presentation and  thinking about all  the things that are going on in Washington right now, I am reminded of the  television series ‘‘The Twilight Zone’’.  These days, I half expect Rod Serling  to appear from behind a curtain and  announce that  ‘‘This is the Twilight  Zone.’’  Well, yes, there’s almost a bizarre  sense of unreality here in the Nation’s  Capitol—the transformation of private  liability into public debt on a massive  scale; the unprecedented level of deficit  spending, debt piled upon debt; borrowing from China in order to give foreign aid to other countries; enacting  Draconian restrictions and controls on  a national economy and on the lives of  our people in order to stop the planet  from going through a climate cycle.  What? The Earth has had so many  climate cycles in the past, and now it’s  being used—the one we’re in, which is  very little different than any of the  other cycles we have been in—it’s being  used  to  justify economy-killing and  freedom-killing  controls,  taxes,  and  mandates, and putting power  in the  hands  of  international  bodies  that  should be the power of the people of the  United States to run their own life.  Our Nation’s borders leak like a spaghetti strainer. Millions of people illegally continuing to pour into our country to consume  limited health care,  education, and other social service dollars. And, yes, to take jobs away from  our people and, in some cases, to commit crimes against our people. Our government just lets it happen. We can’t  even build a darn fence.  And we have had a one-way free trade  policy with China  that has all but  killed medium- and large-scale manufacturing in our country and which has  relegated our own people to low-paying  jobs and sent trillions of dollars to  Communist China.  No one has even suggested a change  in that obviously rotten policy if, for  nothing else, just to give our economy  a little boost. Instead, we begged the  gangster regime that runs China to  loan us even more money—money that  they accumulated because of a trade  policy that has been monstrously counterproductive to the long-term interests of our own people—a one-way free  trade policy.  And  that’s not  the only counterproductive policy which has brought  our economy to its knees. Our people  are suffering high energy prices needlessly.

1160,101,2009-07-14,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," The Washington  Post article is unique in some ways. I  guess it may be SOP for articles that  are somewhat vicious and where they  contain as many errors as  the Air  Force has pointed out with the facts  supporting the errors that were made;  that is, the July 10 Washington Post  article  was  based  upon  unnamed  sources. It was based upon a couple of  folks who said they were fired either by  the contractor or by the Air Force. We  take that for what it is worth.  One of the complaints cited in that  article was the  fact that there are  problems with the skin on the F–22.  Let me back up a minute and talk  about the sophistication of this airplane. There  is a problem with the  skin. That has been a problem. What  we have to remember is that we have  never had an airplane that could fly  with the capability that this airplane  has, that could fly completely undetected, completely through any radar  system of the most sophisticated nature of any potential adversary in the  world. The reason this airplane can do  that is because it is made of substance  and material that is unique and different to this airplane, including the  skin on the airplane. Are we going to  have problems with something that is  that unique and has never been used  before on any tactical air fighter? You  bet we are.  The position of the folks who are in  support of this amendment is that we  ought to stop production of the F–22  and buy the F–35 at a faster rate. Even  if we do that, if we have F–35s flying  tomorrow, they are going to have exactly the same maintenance issues as  the F–22. The F–22 is the model upon  which  the Joint Strike Fighter  is  based. So let’s don’t kid ourselves. We  are not taking an airplane that costs X  and substituting it with an airplane  that costs half or three-quarters of X.  That is not going to be the case. Mistakes have been made—surely—but it  is the first time we have ever had a  weapons system like the F–22 manufactured by anybody in the world. From  the mistakes we have learned. We are  going to have a better F–35. But that  F–35 is going to have the same skin  problem. It is going to have the same  weight problem the F–22 had, the F–15  had, the F–16 had, and probably every  airplane we have ever developed. It is  going to have the same maintenance  issues we are having with the F–22  today.  Although the article was wrong in  one major area with respect to maintenance,  the article  says  the maintenance of the airplane was having a success rate of 55 percent. That is wrong.  As the Air Force points out, between  2004 and today, the successful maintenance rate on those airplanes has gone  from 64 to 69 percent.  The future of TACAIR for the United  States likely does reside in the F–35  and not with the F–22. Even if we keep  buying F–22s, it will never match the  number of F–35s we will eventually  buy. Everyone hopes, as I do, that the  F–35 succeeds. But as the chair and the  ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee  themselves  have  stated,  there is a good deal of risk in the F–35  program, and there is additional risk in  what we need to put in place today  when it comes to the lives of our men  and women who are fighting our conflicts and who are  flying these airplanes.  The history of Defense programs, and  aviation programs  in particular, has  been remarkably consistent, particularly when it comes to building programs that represent a leap in technology. They cost more. They take  longer. They have more problems than  we expect. GAO has criticized the F–35  approach, and they, as well as the leadership of our committee, have stated  that not performing sufficient development testing before we proceed to procurement is one of the primary drivers  for cost increases and schedule delays  in major programs. That  is exactly  what is being proposed with respect to  the F–35.  I am a supporter of the F–35. We are  going to build far more of them than  we are F–22s. But I am not the only observer to state that we should think  twice about staking the future of our  TACAIR fleet on a program that has  only five test aircraft flying today.  I wish to talk briefly about the offsets included in our amendment which  are in the mark used to fund the purchase of these additional seven F–22s.  Senator LEVIN talked about the offset  at length. I would like to respond to  some of his comments. Most  importantly, there is absolutely nothing in  the offset we used and nothing that has  not been used by the Senate Armed  Services Committee or the chairman  himself in previous bills.  Just  last year, Senator LEVIN reduced military personnel  funding by  $1.1 billion, which is significantly more  than what my amendment reduced it  by. For the MILPERS and O&M reductions in my amendment and the markup, in each case the amendment takes  either less or approximately the same  amount as the House Armed Services  Committee bill did for this year. In  every case, the amendment takes less  than the GAO reported average under-  execution/unobligated  balances  in  those accounts. This includes the cuts  the Senate Armed Services Committee  already took in their mark.  The SASC bill itself notes that GAO  estimates that DOD has $1.2 billion in  unobligated O&M balances and  $588  million  under-execution  in  the Air  Force civ pay accounts. This is from  actual language in the Senate report.  In the civilian personnel area, the  GAO reports conclude that more funding is available than what my amendment takes. The GAO report takes into  account the expansion of acquisition  personnel who will be hired this year.  Regarding MILPERS, GAO analysis  suggests that there is on average $1 billion available. My amendment leaves a  balance of $200 million in that account.  The chairman also commented on the  provision in my amendment that assumes savings based on acquisition reform legislation authored by Senators  LEVINand MCCAIN. Let me say that my  inspiration  for this particular offset  was Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN.  I  thought they did a great job with that  bill. I hope we can continue to improve  it because it is an area where we have  to work  harder  to  avoid wasteful  spending.  The chairman included a nearly identical provision as mine  in S.  1416,  which was the Senate version of the  fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization  bill. That bill assumed a savings of $1.6  billion  based  on  acquisition  reform  bills and the SASC bill for that year.  However, unlike my provision, which  assumes savings already in law because  of passage of the Levin-McCain bill,  savings assumed by the chairman were  based on provisions that were not yet  enacted and, based on the conference  process, may never have been enacted.  Based on inflation and large increases  in the DOD budget since then, that is  probably the equivalent of $2 to $2.5  billion today. In any case, this is a tremendous amount of savings, and my  amendment would assume far less. The  offset is based upon predicted savings  in the fiscal year 2010 budget based on  recently passed acquisition reform legislation such as the Weapons System  Acquisition Reform Act, Public Law  111–23, also the business process reengineering  provision  in  the SASC  mark  and  other management  efficiencies and business process reforms.  Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN and  President Obama are correct. Savings  from this acquisition reform measure  could greatly exceed that number, because in their press conference after  the successful passage of that bill, they  all three talked about the tremendous  savings. I agree with them. That  is  going to happen. That is what we used  as part of our offset.  I want to end where I started, by  agreeing  with  John  Hamre.  John  Hamre says:  Congress can and should legitimately question spending priorities.  Not only is it appropriate but necessary for  the Congress to pass final judgment on this  question.  Secretary Gates has  rendered his  judgment. . . .But it is the duty and obligation of  members of Congress to question his recommendations [and his analysis].  There is absolutely nothing unique or  in the least bit wrong about what we  are doing. Not to do so would be to abdicate the role with which the Constitution and the American people have  entrusted us. If President Obama believes the additional funding for these  F–22s warrants a veto  threat,  even  though  that  funding  addresses  an  unmet military requirement, then that  is his decision. Our job in Congress, as  John Hamre has indicated, is to look at  the facts, weigh the risks, and render  the  judgment. That  is our role—our  independent role—in the process, and  we should accept it and use our best  judgment to decide what is right for  the Nation.

1162,108,2009-07-14,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, first, I  thank the Senator from Minnesota for  yielding me this time and, second, I  wish to talk today about waste. We are  all concerned about waste. I have an  amendment which I understand I cannot call up because the parliamentary  situation is such that the floor leaders  did not wish to have another amendment brought up.  This sign here, which is a type of sign  that is proliferating across our Nation  everywhere, reflects waste. It is totally  inexcusable. It is a political advertisement for money that is being spent as  a result of the stimulus package. That  is all  it  is. The sign says:  ‘‘Project  Funded by the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act, Completion August  2009.’’  That  is a political statement, the  purpose of which is to promote spending on the stimulus package. I did not  vote  for  the  stimulus  package.  I  thought a program which is going to  spend almost 50 percent of the money  after the year 2011 made little sense  and was not stimulus at all. But I certainly would not have expected that as  a result of this program we would be  funding these signs all over America to  promote this program.  These signs are not cheap, by the  way. In New Hampshire we get them  for less than most places. They cost  about $300 a sign. But in Georgia they  cost $1,700 a sign; in Pennsylvania they  cost $2,000 a sign; in New Jersey they  are costing $3,000 per sign. Literally,  there are  20,000 projects going on—  most of them paving projects across  this country, paving projects most of  which may have occurred anyway, but  in any event they are paving projects.  If you start multiplying the number of  signs going up, and each one of these  projects require having two or three  signs put up, you are talking very significant dollars, you are talking tens of  millions of dollars for self-promotion of  these programs.  Ironically, these signs are actually  required before people  can get  the  funds. We had a gentleman in one of  our towns in New Hampshire, I think it  was Derry, who said, before he would  be released the dollars to do the project  in his town that the town had applied  for and it had approved, they had to  agree to put up this sign. He didn’t  want to put up the sign. He thought it  was a waste of money, but he was required to put up this sign.  Why are we doing this? The American people are sort of tired of us wasting dollars. They are especially tired of  us wasting dollars trying to blow our  own horn around here. If the administration believed these signs promoting  the stimulus package were so valuable,  let  them  spend campaign  funds—because that is what they are, they are  campaign signs—to put them up. But  instead we are putting these signs up.  What these signs should say if we are  going to put them up is: Project funded  by the future generations of American  taxpayers—and they add to the debt of  our children. That  should be added  under here,  ‘‘add to the debt of our  children.’’  The signs have no value at all, none,  other  than  self-promotion  of  these  projects.  Maybe some of the projects are legitimate.  I  think probably most of  them are  legitimate. To  the extent  they are done within this period of recession, I support them. The problem I  had with the stimulus package was so  much of the money was being spent  outside the period when we know the  recession will be over. But even if the  projects are legitimate, which most of  them I am sure are—although some  have  been  questioned,  such  as  the  crossing path for turtles. That received  a fair amount of press. I have to say I  didn’t understand why we had to build  an underpass for turtles, but I don’t  live in whatever State that was in. But  as a very practical matter, the underpass for turtles had a sign which said  the project is being built at the expense of the American taxpayers, promoting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  This is foolish. This is the type of  thing that drives taxpayers crazy, and  it should. It is so inexcusable. People  get outraged by us doing things such as  this and by  the Government doing  things such as this. You drive by this  sign and, if you have a chainsaw in the  back of your truck, you want to cut  them down. Of course, they put them  up in steel so you have to have a blowtorch, but in any event they should not  be out there, and they certainly should  not be out there costing $300 to $3,000  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:41 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S14JY9.REC S14JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
1163,115,2009-07-14,Mr.  BINGAMAN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am pleased to introduce the  Bureau of Reclamation Fish Recovery  Programs Reauthorization Act of 2009  with my colleagues Senator UDALLof  New Mexico, Senator UDALL of Colorado, Senator BENNET, Senator BENNETT, and Senator HATCH. This bill will  extend the Bureau of Reclamation’s authorization to provide cost sharing for  capital construction and annual operations from 2011 through 2023 for the  Upper Colorado and San Juan River  Basin endangered  fish  recovery programs.  The programs have the dual goals of  recovering federally listed endangered  fish  species  in  the Upper Colorado  River basin while allowing water development and management activities to  proceed in compliance with state laws,  interstate compacts and  the  federal  Endangered Species Act. The programs  have  substantial  support  from  the  Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, the Navajo  Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Nation,  the Southern Ute Tribe, and the Ute  Mountain Tribe. Other water users,  power  customers and  environmental  organizations are also active participants in the programs. The Fish and  Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service  and Western Area Power Administration also participate in the programs.  All of the partners contribute significantly to the success of the programs.  Since 2000, the Bureau of Reclamation has been authorized to utilize revenues generated from Colorado River  Storage Project Act projects as base  funding for operation and maintenance  of capital projects, monitoring and research to evaluate the need for, and effectiveness of, any recovery action, and  for general program management. This  bill extends the Bureau of Reclamation’s authority to provide annual base  funding for the programs through 2023  which coincides with the term of the  existing Cooperative Agreements  for  the  recovery programs and  the  expected date of recovery for certain species covered by the programs. The annual base funding contributes significantly to the successful implementation of the recovery actions in both  programs.  Currently the Bureau of Reclamation’s ability to use such funding will  expire in 2011. If the expiration date is  not extended, the annual base funding  will  be  significantly  reduced which  would likely delay or impede the success of  the  recovery programs. The  original  authorizing  legislation  has  been extended most recently through  Section  9107 of  the Omnibus Public  Land Management Act of 2009, P.L. 111–  11, and the amendments proposed by  this bill would ensure that the Bureau  of Reclamation’s authorization for base  funding coincides with the other authorizing provisions in P.L. 106–392.  I hope my colleagues will work with  me and the bi-partisan group of cosponsors to help ensure that the recovery  goals of the San Juan and Upper Colorado River Basin Recovery Programs  can continue to be met. I therefore  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

This project  is  in  conjunction with several private and public entities in the State of Wisconsin. The EERE account provides federal funds to strengthen the  United States’ energy security, environmental  quality, and economic vitality in public-private  partnerships. This project is expected to both  reduce organic waste sent to the landfill and  produce alternative fuels to replace fossil-fuel  generated energy for campus operations. The  University believes it will save approximately  $150,000 annually in energy savings. Schools,  nursing homes, and other community institutions and households will gain a means to dispose of biomass waste in an environmentally  responsible manner and the entire community  will benefit  from reduced demand on  landfill  capacity. Funding will be used to acquire the  anaerobic digesting plant equipment, plan and  engineer the installation of the digester plant,  and educate  the Oshkosh area community  about this new technology. This project supports  the University’s plan  to develop alternative sustainable energy sources and follow  the Governor of Wisconsin’s directive to eliminate dependence on fossil fuels.

Lake Poygan once provided abundant high quality habitat  for water  fowl and  other birds, furbearers, and warm water fishery. Much of this habitat has deteriorated in  recent years. The existing water  level management strategy is being reviewed to determine its role in the degradation. Water levels  at Lake Poygan have been managed under  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Fox River  project since 1872. The project would involve  the construction of a break wall on Lake  Poygan for the purpose of protecting, improving, and restoring fish and other aquatic life  habitat. FY 2010  funding would be used  to  continue the feasibility phase.

1167,150,2009-07-14,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, today I rise  to recognize and thank Patrol Borough Commander, Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz of the  New York City Police Department who for the  last 15 years and a  total of 24 years has  served my Congressional District with much  CPR—Courtesy,  Professionalism,  and  Respect.  The history of American law enforcement is  a  tale of  triumphs and  tragedies. Since  the  first night watch established in Boston in 1631,  police officers,  the men and women  in blue  who serve and protect our citizenry, have laid  their lives down while serving the public interest. Never having worked in law enforcement,  I can see that police work is often dangerous,  with long hours, impossible weather, and for  not a whole lot of pay, frequently dealing with  the worst elements of our society. It has always been my considered opinion  that all  Americans owe a debt of generosity  to our  honest and hardworking police officers and the  chiefs they serve under for all that they do.  As a  thirty-nine year veteran of  the New  York Police Department, Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz embodies the true spirit of ‘‘New  York’s Finest.’’ He has served and protected  my District with great distinction and his tireless dedication  to Upper Manhattan and his  fellow officers under his command is quite admirable. Assistant Chief Diaz’s life long dedication of service  in  the  line of duty should  serve as an example to all.  Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz was appointed to the New York City Police Department in January 1970 and began his career  on patrol in Manhattan’s 1st Precinct. In January 1972, he was reassigned to East Harlem’s  25th Precinct where he served for nine years.  After a number of assignments  in Brooklyn  and Staten Island and promotions to the rank  of Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Captain, in May  1994 he was assigned back  to my beloved  East Harlem as  the Commanding Officer of  the School Safety Division.  Upon Chief Nicholas Estavillo’s historic ascension as the City of New York’s first Latino  Chief of Patrol in June of 2001, Diaz was selected to replace him as the Commanding Officer of Patrol Borough Manhattan North which  encompasses my entire Congressional District. As the Commanding Officer of Manhattan  North, Assistant Chief Diaz supervised over  2,400 police officers and over 200 civilians in  the 12 Manhattan precincts north of 59th  Street.  Assistant Chief Diaz is ‘‘True Blue;’’ one of  the finest products of my district who came up  through the struggles of life. He was born in  East Harlem’s Metropolitan Hospital to immigrant parents. His father Amador immigrated  from Chile and his mother Helena  from  the  Ukraine. Due  to a  family  illness, Assistant  Chief Diaz and his younger brother Jay were  separated from their parents and raised in foster homes through the Catholic Home Bureau.  Upon graduation from his school, Assistant  Chief Diaz  joined  the United States Marine  Corps where he so valiantly served as Corporal in the Vietnam War. As a result, he was  the recipient of two Purple Hearts. After joining  the Police Department, he attended college  night classes and obtained a Bachelor of Arts  Degree in Sociology. Assistant Chief Diaz is  also a devout family man. He has been married to his wife Lynn for thirty-seven years and  is a proud parent of a son, Carlos.  As he is re-assigned to the coveted Manhattan Borough South Command, I congratulate  Assistant Chief Diaz on his advancement, and  I’m certain that he will continue to serve the  communities of  the new command with  the  same leadership, professionalism, and admiration of those he so valiantly served in my district.  So Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my  distinguished colleagues  join me  in  recognizing my good  friend Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz for all his contributions to my district and the city of New York. He is truly one  of New York’s finest and I wish him well.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. ROSCOE G. BARTLETT  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 14, 2009  ",2009

1170,150,2009-07-14,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Madam Speaker, I  am pleased to reintroduce today the Wildlife  Without Borders Authorization Act  The Wildlife Without Borders Program was  administratively created by the U. S. Fish and  Wildlife Service  in 1983. For  the past 25  years, the International Affairs Office has done  a superb  job of developing wildlife management and  conservation efforts  to maintain  global species diversity.  While  the Congress has already created  Multinational Species Conservation Funds  to  assist highly imperiled African and Asian elephants, Rhinoceros and Tigers, Great Apes  and Marine Turtles, the Wildlife Without Borders program has provided a funding lifeline to  a number of endangered  species  that  for  whatever reason have not merited their own  Multinational Species Conservation Fund.  The first conservation grants issued under  this program were awarded  to  the Wildlife  Without Borders Program  for Latin America  and the Caribbean Initiative. Since that time,  additional  grants  have  been  allocated  for  projects in Africa, Mexico, India, China and the  Russian Federation.  In  fact,  in  the past  two  decades, the International Affairs Office within  the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has approved 955 conservation projects at a cost of  $20.5 million in taxpayer money. These funds  have been matched by more than $60 million  in private non-federal money, which is a remarkable 3 to 1 matching ratio.

Raystown Lake, located  in  the Alleghenies of central Pennsylvania,  is  the Commonwealth’s  largest manmade  lake and a major driver of  the  local  economy.  Funding for this project is a valuable use of  taxpayer dollars because funding is necessary  to offer adequate services, keep  recreation  areas open, maintain seasonal staffing levels,  and provide  for general maintenance and  cleanliness of  facilities. Raystown Lake has  substantial economic impact in central Pennsylvania and yields a sustainable and justified  investment.

Associated  with this research effort is the development of  the energy management and control  technologies required to maximize the energy efficiency of hybrid  locomotives. Converting  the  existing  fleet  to new  technologies would reduce both emissions and our dependence on  foreign oil.  This project is a valuable use to taxpayer  funds because it fits the Department of Energy’s mission with a focus on developing more  energy efficient and environmentally  friendly  transportation  technology  that will  enable  America to use less petroleum and reduce impacts on the environment. Protecting the environment and ensuring our national security  through  reduced dependence on  foreign oil  are critical  issues  facing  the  federal government.

The Port  is the 7th largest container port in the United  States and serves 50 million consumers within  a 500-mile radius. In 2007, the Port of Houston provided $285 billion in economic value,  $72 billion in personal income, and $16.2 billion in Federal Taxes. It is also home to the  second largest petrochemical complex in the  world and  the  largest refinery  in  the United  States.

In order to keep the Port of Houston operating at  full capacity,  the Houston  Ship Channel must be maintained. The  increased natural shoaling has placed greater  pressure on the Port’s capacity to store and  manage dredge material and without increasing capacity they will not be able to dredge the  channel. Without  this  necessary  funding,  dredged material capacity will be unavailable  and material will be pumped longer distances  increasing the cost of dredging for the same  volume of material dredged the previous year.  This request is for additional construction.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. ADAM H. PUTNAM  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 14, 2009  ",2009

Description of Request: Army Corps of Engineers,  annual Operation  and Maintenance  (O&M) funds are needed for periodic dredging  in  the 70 miles of  federal channels  in  the  Tampa Harbor. For FY 2010, the Army Corps’  estimated capability is $5,620,000, to include  various sections of the Tampa Harbor project,  with an emphasis on the upper harbor. The  Tampa Harbor  is a major shipping channel  both for domestic and international trade, and  of importance to national commerce. As Florida’s  largest cargo port,  the Port of Tampa  handles approximately 50 million tons of cargo  per year. The Port of Tampa is also the largest economic engine in West Central Florida  and the nation’s 14th largest port in terms of  short tons.  TAMPAHARBORCONSTRUCTION  PUTNAM  Requesting Member: Rep.

Description of Request:  In January, 2008,  the Army Corps of Engineers completed the  draft General Reevaluation Report  (GRR),  which  focuses on  traffic congestion  in  the  main Tampa Harbor channel, where extensive  delays occur due to lack of adequate channel  width. The Corps’ GRR  found  that  the ship  channel  is  too narrow  to allow  for safe  two  way vessel  traffic due  to  the  introduction of  new longer and broader cruise ships. The impacts associated with having a restriction of  this nature include vessels waiting at berth or  at the sea buoy while large cruise ships transit  the  channel. The GRR  concurs with  the  Tampa Port Authority and the port community  that  the  resulting congestion causes safety  hazards and economic inefficiencies, and recommended widening select portions of  the  main  channel. Therefore,  $500,000  is  requested  to complete Planning, Engineering  and Design (PED).  h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:54 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\E14JY9.REC E14JY9         ",2009

1178,1,2009-07-24,Mr. KUCINICH.," The health care debate ends up being a debate about the  legitimacy of our political system. If  this is truly a government of the people, by the people and for the people,  then why do we not already have a  health care system which meets the  needs of all the people? Is it because we  have a market-based, for-profit health  care system? Why do we have 50 million Americans uninsured and another  50 million Americans  underinsured?  Why are most bankruptcies connected  to people being so heavily in debt for  hospital bills?  America faces not only a health crisis but a spiritual crisis when health  insurance and other  interest groups  stand between  the people and  their  government extracting the wealth of  our Nation and appropriating it to a  few at the expense of the many and  pressing upon the many the burden of  illness and the brevity of life.  It is time to break the hold these interest groups have on our government.

It’s not on our  side. It’s just a fact of the matter. We  don’t know where the jobs are. We were  promised these jobs.  Secondly, it’s good for me to learn  that now I know who runs the Rules  Committee, the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee,  because  I  thought that the chairman of the Rules  Committee did, but I found out now it’s  run by the Appropriations chair. At  least I know that answer today.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 3  minutes  to  the  distinguished  gentleman from Indianapolis, Indiana, ",2009
1181,8,2009-07-24,Mr.  BURTON.,  ,2009
1182,8,2009-07-24,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, in 1965, this Congress passed the  Federal Family Education Loan Program Act, and it was designed to provide private funds for college students’  loans. And since 1965, this program has  provided over 194 million loans to college students, with private funds, and  they’ve delivered about $695 billion in  loans.  The problem that we have is unemployment right now. It’s 9.5 percent nationwide. And in Indiana, my State,  it’s 10.7 percent. And we have 35,000  jobs nationwide that work for this education  program  funded  by  private  funds, and 2,400 people in Indiana. Now,  Mr.  and  I,  Congressman  CARTERand I had an amendment that  would guarantee the survivability of  this program because it has helped so  many college students get loans.  And what the Democrats are trying  to do is they’re trying to have a direct  loan program take the place of the privately  funded program that we now  CARTER have, and that the government and the  taxpayers will be paying for that loan.  It’s one more attempt for them to put  everything that we do, day and night,  under the control of the Federal Government.  Now, why in the world, when we have  a program that’s providing millions of  loans to college students, without taxpayer dollars funding it, why would we  want to change to a direct loan program and have the taxpayers underwrite it, especially at a time when the  economy is going down the tubes and  we’re spending trillions of dollars on  many programs we don’t even need; the  automobile  industry, the banking  financial industry, the health care industry, energy, all of those things?  And now  they’re going after education by trying to come up with a direct loan program that the taxpayers  will have to pay for, and the private  funding that’s now being used will not  be utilized. It will cost somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 jobs across the  country. Now, they want us to have  more jobs. Here’s a chance to preserve  30,000 to 35,000 jobs by not having the  government step in and take over the  financing of college loans for students.  And yet you want to have the government take over, the Department of  Education, take over the direct funding  program, take it away from the private  sector and independent funding so we  would have more government control  and cost another 35,000 jobs we’re going  to put into the unemployment lines. It  makes no sense to me.  My colleagues, I’m very disappointed  you did not allow this under the rule.  We should have fully debated this on  the floor. I think you just didn’t want  to debate it because you don’t want the  American people to see, once again,  we’re putting  everything under  the  control of government, every aspect of  their  lives and now  including  education.  I rise in strong opposition to this rule.  Congressman CARTER and  I submitted an  amendment to Rules Committee that was rejected.  It was a  legitimate and appropriate  amendment for this bill. Unfortunately, under  the House Leadership’s modus operandi of  ‘‘it’s our way or the highway,’’ I shouldn’t be  too surprised that it was not accepted.  Here’s what  the amendment would have  done. The amendment stated  that no  funds  may be used to promulgate, amend, or repeal  any regulation pursuant to the Federal Family  Education Loan program.  Although the Carter-Burton Amendment will  not be debated today, I wanted to make sure  that my colleagues know what  the damage  may be.  First,  I want  to  thank my colleague  from  Texas, Representative JOHNCARTER, for working with me on this amendment. I very much  appreciate his efforts on  the Appropriations  Committee to preserve the FEDERAL FAMILY  EDUCATION LENDING PROGRAM.  The Rules Committee should have supported  the Carter-Burton amendment, and  I  will tell you why.  THEFEDERALFAMILYEDUCATIONLOANPROGRAM  (FFELP) WORKS  The Federal Family Education Loan Program—FFELP for short—was first established  as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965  and has provided higher education funding for  53, tens of millions of Americans.  Since  its creation, FFELP has disbursed  more  than 194 million  loans  to college students totaling nearly 695 billion.  A key component of FFELP is that it utilizes  private capital, not  taxpayer dollars,  to  fund  loans with the Federal Government providing  guarantees against loss.  Competition and choice in student loan delivery and support are hallmarks of the Federal  Family Education Loan Program.  EFFORTSTODISMANTLEFFELP  Right now  there are efforts underway  to  weaken and dismantle  the Federal Family  Education Loan Program (FFELP).  The President’s FY2010 budget plan contained a proposal  that would effectively end  FFLEP and force all student loans through the  government’s Direct Lending.  The President’s plan calls  for all Federal  student loans—beginning with the 2010–2011  academic year—to be made under the Direct  Lending Program. Moving to 100 percent Direct Lending in 2010–2011 coincides with—the  expiration of the temporary loan purchase programs that were authorized by Congress in response  to  the credit crunch  that swept  this  country last year.  The Department of Education  is currently  using appropriated dollars  to  implement  the  President’s proposal, which has been considered by neither house of Congress, nor is authorized under current law.  They are writing letters to schools, enhancing systems, and otherwise using appropriated  funds for a proposal not authorized by Congress.  Evidence of this comes in the form of a July  8, 2009, letter from the Chief Operating Officer  for Federal Student Aid at the Department of  Education  to college presidents detailing  the  steps  the Department  is  taking  to ensure a  smooth  transition  into  the Direct Loan Program.  Quotes from the July 8th letter from the Department of Education to college presidents:  Since the President’s announcement last  February, we have taken numerous steps to  ensure a smooth process for the transition of  schools into the Direct Lending Program. We  have expanded the capacity of the automated  system that is used for the origination of Direct Loans.  Of course, what is most important to you  and your colleagues at other colleges and  universities  is whether campuses will be  ready to move to Direct Lending. To assist  you, we will establish the electronic accounts that will enable your institutions to  electronically send and receive Direct Loan  records and reports. The establishment of  these accounts does not obligate your institution to move to the Direct Lending Program at this time; it simply takes care of  one of the first steps, so that when you are  ready you can select the Direct Loan processing and funding options that work best  for you.  However, to ensure a smooth transition,  please encourage your staff to learn more  about the Direct Loan Program and the business processes that are used to deliver these  important  financial resources to students  and families. If they run into any problems  that have not been satisfactorily addressed  by our staff please let me know immediately.

1187,43,2009-07-24,Mr. TIAHRT.," I thank the chairman.  It’s a pleasure to be here with you this  morning as we continue to consider the  fiscal year 2010 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill.  First, I’m frustrated by my role here  today. Instead of being able to perform  my duties as a ranking member as I’ve  done in the past, my role requires that  I protest the way debate is suppressed  on this bill. It is necessary, but not  something that I relish.  Usually the role of the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee,  as well as the authorizing committees,  is to present the views of the minority  and  to work with  the majority  in  crafting a bill that combines the best  ideas of both sides of the aisle. We do  this through the amendment process.  As the ranking member, I have not always agreed with what my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have proposed, but I always defended their right  to offer their amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank  Chairman OBEY for reaching out to me  during the drafting of this bill. He is a  passionate advocate for many of the  programs funded in this bill, and he has  clearly put a great deal of thought into  this bill before us. I also want to credit  him for trying to put together a bill  that Members could support by including many national priorities; yet, due  to the wholly unsustainable allocation  on top of an already unsustainable allocation in the stimulus bill for these  agencies, we could not agree on the  final product.  I also want to thank the staff for  their dedication to this important bill,  on the majority side, Cheryl Smith,  Susan Quantius, Nicole Kunko, Stephen  Steigleder, Albert Lee, Mike  Gentilly, Amy Battaglia and Devon  Klein; on my side, Stephanie Myers,  Steve  Crane,  of  course AmyClaire  Brusch from my personal office staff.  One of the most important duties of  this House, as directed by article I, section 9 of the Constitution, is to determine the financial obligations of the  Federal Government, the power of the  purse, as we say. This is, indeed, what  we are here to do today, with the  Labor-HHS-Education  Appropriations  bill. Yet instead of being able to have a  healthy discussion, as the Founders intended with this representative body,  Members, both Republican and Democrat, I note, are shut out of the process  and only permitted to speak for a short  time without the ability to offer alternatives.  Several of my colleagues and I submitted amendments to the Rules Committee for consideration on the floor  today.  I think they are substantive  amendments that deal with the public  policy issues our constituents sent us  here to debate. Even though they met  the requirements for consideration on  an appropriations act, the Democrat  leadership decided to report a gag rule  that severely limits our ability to offer  them.  When we first started down this road  to ruin with respect to the autocratic  rules that govern debates on appropriations bills, we were told that these  rules were  required because Republicans were  ‘‘filibustering by amendment’’ and because we would not commit to time limits. We knew at the  time that those arguments were mere  fig leaves, and over the past few weeks,  the evidence has become crystal clear.  We were told that we had to finish  our work quickly, so time agreements  were essential. Next, we were told that  we had done nothing  to  limit our  amendments. Strangely, when we were  in the majority, we didn’t limit amendments to appropriations bills. Why? Because we believed then, as we do now,  that Members have not only the right,  but the constitutional responsibility,  to represent their constituents.  Even so, while we were stating our  continued concern about the restrictive rules by which we have been forced  to abide for this bill, we reached out in  good faith. Instead of offering upwards  towards 50 amendments, House Republicans,  in  good  faith,  limited  the  amendments request. This year, there  were fewer Republican amendments offered on this very substantial bill than  were offered under an open rule just a  few years ago.  Republicans  offered  12—only  12—  amendments. Did some of those amendments pose potentially difficult votes  for Democrats? I guess so.  We  had  an  amendment  by Mr.  CARTERand Mr. BURTON, which would  have been in order under an open rule,  to prohibit the Democrats from killing  the largest student loan program in operation today. Is it permitted to be offered today? No.  We had an amendment by Mr. LEWIS,  the ranking Republican of the Appropriations Committee, again  in order  under the standing rules of the House if  we were operating under the procedures that allowed the American people  full  representation. The amendment would have prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services  from starting a government-run health  insurance plan. The amendment was  ruled by the Parliamentarians to be  permissible under the standing House  rules. Is Mr. LEWISgoing to offer his  amendment today? No. Why not? The  Democrats don’t want to vote on socialized medicine,  probably  because  their leadership and their constituents  don’t agree how they should vote.  As ranking Republican on this subcommittee, I had an amendment that  would have done nothing other than  codify  the nonbinding  language  the  majority  included  in  the  so-called  stimulus bill with  respect  to using  comparative effectiveness research as  an excuse to ration health care. Was I  permitted to offer it? No.  As I travel through the State of Kansas and talk to the people who sent me  here, it is clear that most Kansans, and  I think most Americans, are wondering  if this Congress and this administration understand the  long-term ramifications of the massive spending spree  we’ve been on since January. The stimulus bill we passed spent nearly $800  billion, money we don’t have. When  you add the interest that we’ll have to  pay to the Chinese who buy our debt,  the cost is going to exceed $1 trillion.  And what do we have to show for that  exercise? Unemployment has hit  9.5  percent nationwide and is expected to  rise above 10 percent. Some States are  already well over 10 percent unemployment. If this is recovery, then it is a  ‘‘jobless recovery.’’ Well, who does that  help?  We have massive amounts of money  spent on programs, many funded by the  agencies in this bill that are maybe  good in the long term but have absolutely nothing to do with bringing this  country out of  the economic crisis  we’re facing today. What it did do is  create a mountain of spending that will  hit next year and create the cliff effect.  At the time, the President and the  Democrats  in  the majority  claimed  this was one-time spending that would  drop off after 2011. I’d like to believe  that’s true, because if it isn’t, this bill  will cost about $220 billion, or $60 billion above where we are today, which is  about a 40 percent increase.  I suppose that would be okay if we  had an extra $60 billion laying around  in the Treasury, although I’d prefer to  give it back to those who worked so  hard to earn it. But the fact is, we do  not have this money. It is borrowed. It  is borrowed from the American people.  It is borrowed from their future earnings, and it is borrowed from foreign  governments like China.  Next week we will  consider  the  health reform bill that looks like it’s  going to cost well over $1 trillion, and  it is full of provisions that instruct the  Congressional Budget Office to overlook the spending.  We had a budget submitted to us by  the White House this year that, for the  first time, exceeded $3.5 billion in total  spending. The White House is apparently  so worried about  letting  the  American people know how much of  their money is being spent that they  have delayed the traditional midyear  budget review, which  is expected to  show a historic deficit.  It’s delayed  until next month when Congress has  left Washington and while many Americans are on vacation—well, those that  can afford it this year, anyway.  I want to make clear to the American people what exactly we are voting  on here today. It’s $163 billion in discretionary allocation and an $11 billion  increase from fiscal year 2009, but that  is about a 7 percent increase. But the  true cost to the American taxpayer has  to include the $126 billion that was allocated for those agencies in the stimulus act. So, in reality, these agencies  have grown by $135.3 billion, or a 93  percent increase over 2 years, 93 percent.  My colleagues and I were prepared, as  is historically done in this body, to  offer amendments to hold the spending  to levels we can afford, even move from  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:58 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H24JY9.REC H24JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
1188,50,2009-07-24,Mr. EHLERS.," I rise in support of funding for  the U.S. Department of Education’s Math and  Science Partnerships program. The legislation  we are considering  today appropriates $179  million  for Math and Science Partnerships—  equal to the current funding level.  The Math and Science Partnerships program  is an  innovative, proven program designed to improve teacher content knowledge  and teaching skills in math and science subjects. Through formula grants to every state,  the program provides crucial teacher professional  development  and  teacher  in-service  training by linking school districts with university mathematics, science and engineering departments. As  a  result  of  the Math  and  Science Partnerships program, our students’  math and science skills are strengthened.  This week, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11’s mission and astronauts  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the  Moon. This event, and  the earlier  launch of  Sputnik,  sparked  remarkable  interest  in  science education, and led to the creation of  many  valuable  federal education programs  over the next several decades. One such program,  the Eisenhower Professional Development Act, was originally enacted  in 1985  to  provide funding for professional development  opportunities for math and science educators.  In fact, before the No Child Left Behind Act  (NCLB), Congress provided substantially more  funding for math and science teacher professional development  through  the Eisenhower  program. In short, in spite of our great national  need for more well-trained scientists and engineers, we are providing  less  than half as  much funding for training science teachers as  we did before NCLB was passed  into  law.  Currently, many science teachers report little,  if any, funds available for professional development activities.  Earlier this year, Representative HOLTand I  led the charge to provide at least $450 million  in funding for the Math and Science Partnerships program. Twenty-three Members of Congress  joined us  in sending a  letter  to  the  Labor, Health & Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee requesting this important  funding.  I am disappointed  that  the bill before us  today provides  level  funding  for  the Math &  Science Partnerships program. However, I am  deeply grateful to Chairman OBEY for his willingness  to  include $5 million  in additional  funding for the Math & Science Partnerships  program in his manager’s amendment. I sincerely thank him for recognizing the need for  increased  funding  for  the Math and Science  Partnerships program. I also thank Representative HOLT for his continued dedication to supporting this program and for his work in securing this additional funding.  ",2009
1189,50,2009-07-24,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Chair, I rise in support  of H.R. 3293, the Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education Appropriation bill for  fiscal year 2010. In tough economic times, it is  this important spending measure that makes  critical investments in job training, strengthens  health and social safety nets, and provides the  educational opportunities that are critical to the  nation’s long-term prosperity. I want to thank  Chairman OBEY for his tireless work on this always challenging legislation.  I also want to thank Chairman OBEY for including $70.7 million  in  the bill—the President’s  request—for  the World Trade Center  (WTC) Health programs, which provide medical monitoring and  treatment  to WTC  responders, community members, and others  who have become ill because of the aftermath  of the attacks on September 11, 2001. While  the New York Delegation works toward a long-  term  legislative solution  in passage of  the  James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (H.R. 847), this funding to continue  the current WTC Health programs  is absolutely critical in ensuring that the heroes and  heroines of 9/11 receive the health care they  need and deserve.  Again, I am pleased to support this bill and  thank Chairman OBEY for his leadership.  ",2009
1190,50,2009-07-24,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of  the 2010 Labor, Health & Education  Appropriations (H.R. 3293). It will ease the recession by  increasing  job  training, strengthening the social safety net, and investing in  families.  I am particularly supportive of  the  bill’s education and health care provisions.  The bill makes critical  investments  toward  the goal of providing every student with a  world-class  education. Additional  resources  will go to Title I schools serving low-income  students, as well as programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Act  (IDEA), which  serve 6.7 million students with disabilities. The  bill also provides $545 million for assistance to  thousands of schools with chronically poor  performance. When coupled with funding from  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,  states will  receive $4 billion  to  turn around  these schools and create opportunities for children.  This  legislation will also make college affordable for many more students by continuing  to increase the Pell Grant. Since Democrats  took charge of Congress in January 2007, the  maximum Pell Grant has increased 37 percent  from $4,050 to $5,550.  The  legislation also  invests  in our health  care system to make our nation healthier and  more productive. The bill will help Community  Health Centers provide care  for 17 million  Americans with a $2.2 billion investment. It will  also help us to meet nursing and other workforce shortfalls by increasing support for training of medical professionals. Finally, the legislation provides a $992 million increase for the  life saving research carried out by the NIH.  This bill continues the commitment to reconstruct our public schools and address  the  health care crisis by building on the historic  education and health investments made by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I  urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.  ",2009
1191,50,2009-07-24,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Chair, I rise to support the FY10 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill.  As we continue to debate sweeping health  care reform, today’s legislation makes investments  in our most urgent needs,  including  $2.2 billion  for community health centers  to  serve vulnerable populations, $530 million to  train new health professionals, and $204 million to continue an aggressive campaign to reduce  life-threatening  infections  that patients  acquire while receiving treatment for medical  or surgical conditions.  I am pleased that the bill includes $31.3 billion  for  the National  Institutes of Health, although  I am concerned  that  the  funding  increases will not keep up with escalating biomedical costs. As we consider the costs of our  health care system, we must make the investments necessary to find cures for chronic diseases that require expensive long-term care.  I also strongly support  the $10 million  in  funding included for the Caroline Pryce Walker  Conquer Childhood Cancer Act,  legislation  I  co-authored  with  former  Congresswoman  Deborah Pryce. This will fund pediatric cancer  research activities  to eradicate  the number  one cause of death for our nation’s children.  Today’s bill also makes vital investments in  education and workforce development.  It  includes $17.5 billion for Title I grants to serve  20 million disadvantaged children and $11.5  billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Act,  which, when combined with funding from the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will  support a 25 percent Federal contribution for  special education. Additional new investments  are made  in  literacy and dropout prevention  initiatives.  In a time when students across the country  are struggling to pay for college, this bill continues the new Congress’s commitment to affordable education by  raising  the maximum  Pell grant award to $5,550.  The bill also includes a $50 million investment in green job training, to prepare workers  for a new, 21st century economy. Additional  funding  is  included  to  train  veterans  transitioning  to a civilian workforce and dislocated workers who have lost their jobs during the recession.  Mr. Chair,  the FY10 Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill funds some of our nation’s most important domestic priorities.  I urge my colleagues to support these critical investments  in our nation’s children, families, and workers.  ",2009

I’m very  pleased that the chairman of this committee has tried to allow areas of this  country around schools, around places  to be vacant of these systems.

1196,71,2009-07-24,Ms. LEE of California.,"  I  rise  in  strong opposition to this amendment.  The simple fact of the matter is the  needle exchange programs do work.  Since 1999, there have been at least 18  major reviews and assessments of needle exchange programs under the Republican and Democratic administrations, which concluded that needle exchange  programs  help  reduce  the  spread of AIDS and other  infectious  diseases without encouraging or  increasing drug use.  Studies also show that needle exchange programs serve as an effective  entry for drug users to access the public health system and receive substance  abuse treatment to help them overcome their addiction. And that is what  it is about.  We all want to make sure that those  who are using drugs overcome their addiction. This is a proven strategy. And  so I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. We have to remember, funding  HIV/AIDS  strategies  involve prevention. This is a prevention measure.  ",2009

1198,71,2009-07-24,Mr. SOUDER.,"  I have tracked this  issue for a long time. You can make allegations of studies, but studies are in  fact very mixed on both sides, as I read  from the office of National Drug Control Policy person who studied all the  studies, worked with  the people at  night in the studies and, quite frankly  and honestly, they’re mixed.  There’s a new recent study in Vancouver by somebody who advocated the  program, who also advocates the legalization of marijuana, and he concluded  that the study, at least in the downtown area of Vancouver, showed some  progress on AIDS but no progress on  heroin.  Now  I mentioned Vancouver. Vancouver and Switzerland have been addressing this question long before the  United States got into this. When you  go over to Switzerland and study their  program, they evolved first from a needle exchange to then having a place  where they could inject, separate, then  to the government of Switzerland providing the heroin and managing.  To some degree, they have reduced  certain elements of problems. They did  not reduce heroin abuse. In fact, you  could  argue  they  increased  heroin  abuse. They basically turned a bunch  of people into zombies instead of addressing the social problem of heroin  addiction.  Now in Vancouver, where I’ve been  three times—and I encourage people to  go to the Cop Squad site, policemen  who have been dedicated to trying to  counter what some of the government  has been  spreading about  the drug  problem in Vancouver.  Vancouver is a very interesting case  because they were first. They were the  first city in North America that in effect had a drug-free zone and dealt with  the needles question. And it has been  debated.  There are certain studies now that  claim this is a brand new experiment.  It’s been going on for at least 10 years.  The first time I was there, they had a  needle exchange. They just had people  in the street, with a stand, trying to do  needles.  By the next time I went up there,  they had an injection site, and they  were out trying to reach and they had  spread into the suburbs, because they  didn’t want people have to go just to  downtown, they wanted it in the suburbs. And most of the studies were only  studying the downtown area.  The third time I was there, they’ve  got these guys out in the street peddling, trying to keep the police away.  Now  let me  read  from an article  about downtown Vancouver, where the  Winter Olympics are going to be held,  where we have a zero standard of narcotics on our athletes, yet  they’re  going to be going to a city where, ‘‘the  junkies come here almost around the  clock, seven days a week. Some just  grab a fistful of clean syringes from  one of the buckets by the door and  head out again. But about 600 times a  day, others walk in with pocketfuls of  heroin, cocaine or speed that they’ve  scored out on the street; sign in; go to  a clean, well-lit room lined with stainless-steel booths; and, under the protective watch of  two nurses,  shoot  their drugs into their veins.’’  b1300  Welcome to North America’s only officially sanctioned supervised injection  site. The facility sits in the heart of  Vancouver, 10 blocks that compose one  of the poorest neighborhoods in all of  Canada. The area is home to an estimated 4,700 intravenous drug users and  thousands of crack addicts. For years  it’s been a world-class health disaster,  not  to mention  a  public  relations  nightmare for a town that is famous  for its beautiful mountains and beaches  and is gearing up to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. Nearly a third of the  downtown East Side inhabitants are estimated to be HIV-positive, according  to the U.N. Population Fund, a rate on  par with Botswana. Twice that number  have hepatitis C. Dozens die of drug  overdoses every year. This has been a  problem that has been building and  building, now spreading to the suburbs  of British Columbia. They have the  first gun violence there, drug pushers  moving there. It is an example of the  failure of this program.  We are in the process of eliminating  moral hazard in America. If you fail in  your bank, we bail you out; if you fail  in your business and go bankrupt, we  bail you out. Now the question is, are  we going to eliminate moral hazard in  narcotics? At what point do we send a  message not just this year but 5 years  from now and 10 years from now that  there’s no accountability for your behavior, that everything is okay, we’re  just going to put you over the zone?  One of the problems with these zones  is they’re often where the homeless  shelters are; they are often where the  people that we have deinstitutionalized  are. And they have seen a soaring of  their addiction rates because we put  these needles in places—although away  from a school—they are just by the  poorest people. But the people who are  most vulnerable to seeing drug addiction for the first time, having free needles right there. And every society that  has done this has also started to provide the free heroin. They are even now  into providing  free cocaine and  free  narcotics because they say, Well, the  people won’t go in. The lines are too  long. That’s the answer in Vancouver:  ‘‘The lines are too long, so we’re doing  it out on the street anyway.’’ As you  get more and more packed in in the different areas, you have to put in additional sites or, in fact, unless you provide the narcotics in the safe area and  then the government—in fact, the taxpayers—are funding a habit.  We need to use this on drug treatment. We don’t have enough dollars in  drug treatment. We are, in fact, cutting back what prevention programs  we do have. There is no longer a Safe  and Drug-Free Schools Program. It is  proposed to be zeroed out and changed  to Safe Schools. The drug czar has been  taken down from a cabinet post to just  another consultant. I don’t even know  if he’s really a czar anymore. We’ve  been cutting drug funds in this Congress. The question is, Is there going to  be a moral hazard in America? Or are  we just going to create a bunch of people who we just write off and don’t pay  attention? Walker Percy wrote a great  book called The Thanatos Syndrome  where he talks about a drug-addicted  society that no longer has free will.  Are we going to have accountability in  America or not? And are we going to  fund this type of project?  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",2009

1201,85,2009-07-24,Mr. CANTOR.," I thank the gentleman.  I  think  the  gentleman,  though,  speaks to the point I’m trying to make.  We are trying to get things right here,  and  spending billions of dollars  for  spending’s sake is not the goal here,  and I know he agrees with me on that,  that we are trying to effect the most  prudent expenditure of taxpayer dollars in these very difficult economic  times.  As the gentleman knows, we voted on  a PAYGO bill this week, and frankly,  the spirit behind that PAYGO bill was  to attempt  to  restrain  the  type of  spending that we’ve seen this Congress  conduct. In fact, this week, in one of  the reports, one of the authors of an  opinion column said, frankly, we are  spending—the  spending PAYGO  bill  that was passed this week was full of  loopholes.  And again, we know that the PAYGO  bill that was passed was that. It wasn’t  a holistic PAYGO bill. It wasn’t something that, frankly, will do much to address the runaway spending. So we still  sit here, Mr. Speaker, and want to have  an open process so we can contribute to  holding back the runaway spending in  this town.  So I would say to the gentleman, just  as he has said to me, we ought to be  looking to try and open up this process  again. We were not allowed to do so in  the PAYGO debate and address  the  number one concern of this government right now, which is the runaway  spending. We have not been allowed to  do so in any of the appropriations bills,  and if we are going to be here through  the weekend, as the gentleman may  suggest, why isn’t it we couldn’t take  that time to debate the DOD bill in an  open and full, transparent manner?  I yield.  ",2009
1202,85,2009-07-24,Mr. HOYER.," As I said, I think we’ll  have a rule similar to the ones that we  have considered the previous 11 bills  under.  ",2009
1203,85,2009-07-24,Mr. CANTOR.," I didn’t hear the gentleman, Mr. Speaker.  ",2009
1204,85,2009-07-24,Mr. HOYER.," I said, as I said, I believe  we will be considering the defense bill  under rules similar to those which have  led to the passage of the other 11 bills.  I yield back.  ",2009
1205,85,2009-07-24,Mr. CANTOR.," I will say to the gentleman,  obviously, with much  disappointment, and  I think really reflecting the disappointment on the part  of the American people, that we should  be having a much more robust debate  on these issues. Certainly, if we are  going to be addressing the  issue of  health care, and the gentleman says  that his side is insistent on rushing  back to the floor, insisting on some political deadline, then  I don’t understand why it is we couldn’t have an  open debate on some of the other issues  if we are going to be waiting around  here until next Monday or Tuesday.  So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman, and I yield back.  f  ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY, JULY  27, 2009  ",2009
1206,85,2009-07-24,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 12:30 p.m. on Monday  next for morning-hour debate, and further, when the House adjourns on that  day, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. on  Tuesday, July 28, 2009,  for morning-  hour debate.  ",2009
1207,85,2009-07-24,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  f  INCREASE PRESSURE ON  HONDURAN COUP GOVERNMENT  (Mr. MCGOVERN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ,2009
1208,85,2009-07-24,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, the de  facto  government  in Honduras  and  President Zelaya should accept the San  Jose Accord proposed by Costa Rican  President Oscar Arias. The Arias proposal includes the return of President  Zelaya, formation of a unity government, a general amnesty for political  crimes by all parties, and moves forward the date of the upcoming elections.  The U.S. should impose tough sanctions on the de facto government that  carried out the coup. The U.S. should  suspend all MCC funds, cancel visas for  members of the de facto government  and their families, and freeze all their  assets in the United States. President  Zelaya must also accept the terms of  the Arias proposal in order to restore  democracy  in Honduras  and  avoid  greater conflict and bloodshed.  Not a single, solitary government in  the world recognizes the coup government. It’s time to end this stalemate  and move forward. The Arias proposal  puts the Honduran people first, treats  all parties with respect, and offers a  peaceful resolution. It’s not too late for  President  Zelaya  and  Roberto  Micheletti to accept it.  f  F–22 PRODUCTION  (Mr. GINGREY of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2009
1209,85,2009-07-24,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, 2 days after the Senate voted to  strip funding for an additional seven F–  22 Raptors from the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, it seems that  critical  information may have been  withheld that could have  influenced  the outcome of this vote; an internal  Pentagon oversight board report has  revealed that full rate production of  the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter may be  delayed.  Given that the need to transition to  the F–35 was cited by several Senators  who voted to terminate the F–22 program, it is indeed troubling that this  information was held internally until  after the F–22 vote earlier this week. If  the Pentagon had been forthright with  the facts, there is a very strong chance  that the hearts and the minds of several Senators might have been changed  and the funding for the additional F–  22s may not have been stripped.  The news that the F–35 will again be  delayed only further strengthens the  argument for continued production of  the world’s only fifth-generation fighter  in  full-rate production,  the F–22  Raptor.  I hope that as we move forward with  negotiations between the House and  the Senate on the future of the F–22  program,  the  Pentagon will make  every effort possible to ensure that  Congress is fully briefed on the facts  and what they mean for the future of  American air dominance.  f  JULY 24, 2009, THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KITCHEN DEBATE  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2009
1210,85,2009-07-24,Mr. LANCE.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  July 24, marks the 50th anniversary of  an important incident in the history of  the cold war, the famous Kitchen Debate  in Moscow between  then Vice  President Richard Nixon and Soviet  Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  At the informal debate in 1959, Mr.  Khruschchev predicted wrongly  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  overtake  America  in economic prosperity. As  Time Magazine reported, Vice President Nixon managed in a unique way to  personify a national character proud of  peaceful accomplishment, such as its  way of  life, confident of  its power  under threat.  Today,  I pay tribute to President  Nixon for his diplomacy and his years  of service to the Nation, including at  the Kitchen Debate 50 years ago today.  f  FOREIGN WORKERS AND U.S.  AIRCRAFT  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
1211,85,2009-07-24,Mr. POE  of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  American taxpayers spend millions of  dollars a year screening people who  board an airplane. We check IDs and  roll-on luggage. We check purses, pockets and computers, and we take off our  shoes. We check everything that goes  through the door. But the next attack  on our country is probably not going to  be because somebody is flying in an  airplane. It will probably be because  somebody has access to our airports  and our airplanes who shouldn’t.

1251,106,2009-07-24,Mr. CASEY.," I will submit  for the  RECORDonly two pages of this; it is a  long report. It includes the cover page  and then a page on Pennsylvania which  I will briefly refer to, and then I wish  to talk about how the report implicates and examines the information on  the chart I have on my left.  Here is what the report says on page  86 for Pennsylvania. It is true of a lot  of States, but unfortunately for Pennsylvania, it is a higher number. I am  quoting from part of page 86:  By 2016——  Just 7 years away——  Pennsylvania residents will have to spend  nearly $27,000, or close to 52 percent of median household income to buy health insurance for themselves and their families. This  represents a 93 percent increase over 2008 levels and the sixth highest premium cost in  the country.  So in Pennsylvania, if we do nothing,  if we stay on that road to the status  quo, which I believe is the road to ruin  when it comes to the budgets of our  families and our businesses—if we stay  on  that  road,  for Pennsylvania,  it  means that by 2016, the people of Pennsylvania will be paying 52 percent of  their median household income to buy  health  insurance  for themselves and  their families. That is what it means.  That is what the status quo is. That is  where we are headed if we say, Well, we  couldn’t get the job done here in Washington.  The chart on my left is also a chart  that  reflects  the work of  the New  America Foundation,  ‘‘The Cost  of  Doing Nothing.’’ These are U.S. numbers between 2008 and 2016. The cost of  premiums now, as of 2008, is $13,244,  going up to $24,291; in just 8 years, an  83.4 percent increase. That is the status  quo. That is where we are headed. That  is where we are going if we listen to  the voices in Washington that say it is  too tough to do this. People are not  ready for this yet. There are too many  powerful  special  interests  telling us  not to do it. It might be insurance interests, it might be business interests,  or it might be very partisan politicians  telling us we shouldn’t do this. That is  the cost of doing nothing. That is the  status quo.  I will go to the next chart which  again is from this report, ‘‘The Cost of  Doing Nothing,’’ and this  is a U.S.  number as well: Share of household income spent on premiums climbing. As I  said, in Pennsylvania, where the share  of median household income would go  up to 52 percent, in those few short  years, 7 or 8 years—the U.S. number  fortunately for the rest of the country  is a little less, but it is still very high.  So if we do nothing, if we stay where  we are and do the same old thing—runaway costs, lower quality, no prevention, all of the things we are not doing  now—we will go from a median family  income,  them paying  26 percent of  their income for health care, which is  high in and of itself, to paying over 45  percent of their income for health care.  Again, this chart depicts the status  quo, the cost of doing nothing.  When we talk about costs here, we  have to talk about the cost of doing  nothing. What people are paying now is  in my judgment too high. We ought to  try to bring that number down, but we  should certainly avoid at all costs that  number going up for the American people.  I don’t know too many families out  there—maybe there are a few—but I  don’t know too many families in America and I don’t know any in Pennsylvania who have come up to me and  said, You know what. Don’t worry  about getting health care done because  in 7 or 8 years I will be able to afford  52 percent of my income to go to health  care. I haven’t heard that from anybody in my State. I doubt there is anybody  in America who will say, You  know what. Let’s not do anything.  Let’s stay on the road we are on. I can  afford and my family can afford to pay  45 percent of our income to health care  in a couple of years. Don’t worry about  it. We are going to be fine. So that is  what the status quo  is, and that  is  where we are headed.  Finally, I would conclude with this.  When we listen to the voices of the  American people, people such as Trisha  Urban, as I mentioned before, who in  her letter to me of February, right in  the middle of the letter said this: She  talked about her husband having to  make a change, that he had to leave  his job for 1 year to complete an internship requirement to complete his  doctorate in psychology. So as he is  trying to advance his education, he  pays a health care price. That is another whole part of this story, before  he died. She said the internship was  unpaid  and  they  could  not  afford  COBRA.  Why should a change in someone’s  life to improve their education to complete a doctorate affect their health  care? That is the system we have. That  is the status quo.  But then she says:  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:30 Jul 25, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JY6.006 S24JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1253,113,2009-07-24,Mr. DODD.," I thank the Presiding Officer. I am going to take a few minutes,  if  I can, to talk about health care  again. I did on Wednesday evening, and  I  intended  to  speak yesterday, but  there was an objection raised to having  any morning business yesterday while  we were considering the Defense authorization bill. So as a result of that,  I was unable to come to the floor and  talk about the health care issues in our  country and the pending legislation in  this body and in the other body.  As some may know—I know my colleagues are aware of this—I have been  in the position of being the acting  chairman of the Senate HELP Committee. The committee is chaired by  our dear friend and colleague Senator  TEDKENNEDY, who is wrestling with  his own health care crisis at this very  hour and so has been unable to be with  us these last several months as we have  begun the process of marking up, that  is, considering the legislation dealing  with health care. So as the person sitting next to him on that committee, I  was asked to assume the responsibility  of chairing the committee as we considered the health care legislation.  We have finished our work. We finished it a week ago on Wednesday after  numerous hours. I point this out to our  colleagues—I know many of them may  be aware of this already—we on the  HELP Committee  spent close  to  60  hours in consideration of our bill. I am  told it was the longest time that—at  least in memory of all here—the committee has spent on the consideration  of any single bill.  We had some 23 sessions over 13 days.  There were around  800 amendments  filed before our committee. We considered just shy of 300 of them. Of that 300,  we accepted 161 amendments from our  Republican friends on the committee.  Many  of  these  amendments were  technical amendments. But they were  not all technical amendments. They  were worthwhile and positive amendments, and there were a number of  very important amendments that were  offered by our Republican colleagues  that I think strengthened and made  the bill a better bill, substantially a bipartisan bill.  At the end of the day, after all of  these hours and work, we did not have  the votes of our Republican friends on  the committee. But their contribution  to the product was significant. As I  mentioned earlier, Senator GREGGand  a number of our Republican colleagues  on  the  committee were  concerned  about the long-term fiscal impact of  the new voluntary insurance program  for  long-term care. We agreed with  that amendment. It was a tremendous  help.  Senator  of Georgia raised  the issue of end-of-life care, drawing on  his own family experiences. We were  able to accommodate his ideas in that  area.  Senators ENZI, GREGG, and ALEXANDER suggested that we increase employers’ flexibility to offer workplace  wellness programs with incentives for  employees. That was a very sound proposal, one that has been recommended  to us by others. It was added to the  bill. Senator HARKIN did a very good  job, along with others, in reaching that  accommodation.  Senator HATCH’s  amendment was  dealing with follow-on biologics. The  full Hatch proposal was adopted by the  committee.  Our friend TOMCOBURN from Oklahoma proposed an amendment to empower individuals to make healthy decisions by having the CDC establish a  ISAKSON VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:30 Jul 25, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JY6.011 S24JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1260,148,2009-07-24,Mr. HUNTER.," Madam Speaker, pursuant to  the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of  H.R. 3288,  the Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for FY 2010:  I originally requested $2 million in this legislation for the Improvements to State Route 52  East/West project  through  the Federal Highway Administration’s Transportation & Community & System Preservation account.  It  is  my understanding  that $400,000 was ultimately appropriated  for  this project by  the  Subcommittee and the entity to receive funding for this project is the San Diego Association of Governments  (SANDAG),  located at  401 B Street, Suite 800, San Diego, California  92101.  This project seeks to add Managed Lanes  and extends  the  freeway  to greatly  improve  traffic flow in East San Diego County on SR52  from 1–15, east to SR67, including a freeway  exchange at SR52 and SR67, allowing for traffic flow to be reversed during peak periods.  This project has been identified as ‘‘high-priority’’ by local and state transportation agencies as it will provide residents living in East  County better access  to employment  in  the  western part of the region while also relieving  congestion on existing freeways and local arterials. For example, the completed project is  expected to reduce traffic on Interstate 8 by as  much as 20%.  I also originally requested $2 million in this  legislation  for  the Bradley Ave/State Route  (SR)–67 Interchange project through the Federal Highway Administration’s Transportation &  Community & System Preservation account. It  is my understanding  that $400,000 was ultimately appropriated  for  this project by  the  Subcommittee and the entity to receive funding for this project is the County of San Diego,  located at 5555 Overland Avenue, San Diego,  California 92123.  The Bradley Ave/SR–67 Interchange experiences heavy congestion during  the morning  and afternoon commute and currently operates at a failing level of service during peak  traffic hours. This project will provide congestion  relief  for  the  residential neighborhoods  east of SR–67, the businesses west of SR–67  and  regional  commuters by widening 0.75  miles of Bradley Avenue  from  two  lanes  to  four, add lanes to the SR–67 on-ramps and  off-ramps and replace the narrow existing 2-  lane Bradley Avenue bridge over SR–67 with  a 6-lane bridge. New bike lanes and sidewalks  will also be incorporated into this project on  Bradley Avenue.  Bradley Avenue is a key part of San Diego’s  Regional Arterial System and is classified as a  Major Road. Improvements to this interchange  will address  local accessibility and  regional  mobility, all  joint goals of County of San  Diego, Caltrans, SANDAG, City of El Cajon  and City of Santee, substantially alleviating  congestion and improving traffic flow through  the area. This is particularly necessary during  commuter hours, but essential during disasters  and evacuations which have occurred twice in  the past five years.  Finally, I requested, and the Subcommittee  appropriated, $250,000  in  this  legislation  for  the East County Boys & Girls Club Teen Center project through the Housing and Urban Development’s Economic Development Initiatives  account. The entity to receive funding for this  project is the Boys & Girls Club of East County Foundation, Inc., located at 8820 Tamberly  Way, Santee, California 92071.  The East County Boys & Girls Club Teen  Center project focuses on the rehabilitation of  the 48-year-old Boys & Girls Club building and  conversion of the Wells Park Fieldhouse into  a facility that can service young adults. With  the rehabilitation of both facilities, the number  of El Cajon youth that can be served will increase from 230 to 400 per day. The Boys &  Girls Clubs of East County have provided a  number of recreational, cultural and leadership  programs that promote good behavior, active  lifestyles and a positive alternative  to  the  streets. By converting the existing Clubhouse  to a center for 6–10 year olds, and relocating  the 11–18 year old population  to  the new  Teen Center, the Boys & Girls Club will enhance  learning environments  for both populations  resulting  in  improved  academic  achievement,  citizenship,  decreasing  police  contact and vastly  improving health  through  childhood obesity and athletic programs.

1261,155,2009-07-24,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker,  this year  marks the 35th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), the single largest provider of civil legal aid for the poor in the nation. Established by Congress in 1974, LSC is  a private, nonprofit organization that promotes  equal access to justice and provides grants for  high-quality civil  legal assistance  to  low-income Americans. The people who come  to  LSC-funded programs  for help are  the most  vulnerable among us: women seeking protection from abuse, mothers trying to obtain child  support,  families  facing unlawful evictions or  foreclosures that could leave them homeless,  disaster victims trying to obtain federal emergency assistance or insurance payments to rebuild their lives. In fact, three out of four clients are women—many of whom are struggling to keep their children safe and their families together.  LSC’s work is more important than ever before, partly because of the impact of the current recession. Economic downturns affect the  poor disproportionately and add to the pressures on the nation’s public health and safety,  child welfare, housing and jobs programs. Ensuring  that  the  poor  are  adequately  represented in the civil judicial system greatly improves their chances of keeping or securing  basic necessities—the keys  to stability and  self-sufficiency.  It also helps keep communities healthy. For low-income individuals and  families,  legal services often  represent  their  only means of access to the justice system.  Nearly 51 million people—including 17.6 million children—are eligible for LSC-funded services. LSC-funded programs close nearly one  million cases per year nationwide and provide  other assistance to more than five million people. The clients served are at or below 125  percent of the federal poverty threshold, an income of about $27,000 a year for a family of  four. An overwhelming demand for civil legal  services exists. Based on a 2005 study, 50  percent of eligible potential clients requesting  assistance  from LSC-funded programs are  turned away for lack of adequate program resources. At a time when poor Americans are  struggling to keep their jobs, homes, and basic  necessities  for  their  families,  it  is crucial  for  the federal government to continue to address  the civil legal needs of these vulnerable people as a national priority. Fortunately, LSC has  broad bipartisan support for a strong federal  role in access to equal justice efforts.  On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of  the Legal Services Corporation, I welcome my  fellow Members of Congress to join me in recognizing the critical role that the Legal Services Corporation plays in helping America live  up to its commitment to ensure equal access  to justice for all.

1262,155,2009-07-24,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H. Res. 285, congratulating  the  people of  the Republic of Lithuania on  the  one-thousandth anniversary of Lithuania and  celebrating the rich history of Lithuania. I congratulate Lithuania on this important anniversary and extend many happy returns  to  the  Lithuanian people. I thank my esteemed colleague, Congressman SHIMKUS, for introducing  this important legislation.  As co-chair of  the House Baltic Caucus  I  have worked to advance the strong ties that  exist between the United States and Lithuania.  I look forward to strengthening diplomatic ties  through  the promotion of democratic values  that support both social and economic justice.  The Baltic people have a proud history  that  shows their dedication to these values as well  as the values of liberty and democracy. I am  proud  that our  two nations share such a  strong commitment  to democracy and diplomacy.  Lithuania’s history is long and laudable. In  recent years Lithuania has advanced its status  as an international citizen. Lithuania declared  independence  from  the  former Soviet Union  on March 11, 1990. Along with the other Baltic  States, Latvia and Estonia, Lithuania became  a member of NATO in March of 2004. Just  two months later in May 2004 Lithuania joined  the European Union with her Baltic counterparts.  On July 12, 2009, Lithuania made history  once again by swearing  in  their  first  female  president,  Dalia  Grybauskaite.  President  Grybauskaite has reaffirmed Lithuania’s commitment to our many shared values. Under her  leadership, Lithuania  continues  to  show a  clear commitment to uphold equality, freedom  of speech and human rights.  She has stated her  intention  to amend a  controversial  censorship  law  scheduled  to  enter force on March 1, 2010. The law has  been criticized by gay rights activists and others for discriminating against homosexuals by  prohibiting  references  to  homosexuality  in  media available to children.  I commend President Grybauskaite for her  commitment  to uphold equality and human  rights for all people. I congratulate Lithuania  on  its one-thousandth anniversary and will  continue to celebrate Lithuania’s rich history. I  strongly support this legislation and urge my  colleagues to do so as well.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. JOE BARTON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 23, 2009  ",2009

CANDICE S. MILLER  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 23, 2009  ",2009
1267,162,2009-07-24,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to officially recognize the new Rolland-Warner Middle School in Lapeer, Michigan, which is named in honor of Doris F. Rolland and the late Ronald C. Warner. The community is preparing to mark this special occasion with a dedication ceremony on August  27th at the site of the new facility.  The process to name the school took nearly  two months, and it was anything but simple  and easy considering  there was an exceptional  list of 19 possible candidates  to pick  from. Any one of these individuals would have  been an excellent choice to receive this honor.  But  in  the end,  the members of  the Lapeer  Community Schools, LCS, Board of Education  voted unanimously  to name  the  facility  the  Rolland-Warner Middle School.  Mrs. Doris Rolland truly is an extraordinary  person, and I commend her for her dedication  and  tireless work  to educate  the youth of  Lapeer County. Mrs. Rolland still resides  in  beautiful Mayfield Township with her husband.  Her resume speaks volumes about her commitment and devotion to help children succeed  in academics and  life, and especially  those  with special needs. Mrs. Rolland was both a  teacher and principal at Woodside School at  Oakdale, which coincidentally is the site of the  new facility. In addition, she supervised a staff  of 300 people who worked in the residential  unit,  the  research  unit  and  the  unit  that  housed students with emotional  impairment.  Mrs. Rolland also served for 10 years as director of special education  that served 750  students and 200 staff. She demonstrated unwavering passion  for her work, and never  questioned her mission. I thank her for her devoted spirit and willingness to assist the future  of Lapeer, and I also want to offer my sincere  congratulations on this very appropriate honor.  Mr. Ronald Warner held many positions during his 41 plus years career in the education  field that concluded in 1984 when he retired  as the Assistant Superintendent for the Lapeer  Community Schools. However, Mr. Warner  sadly passed away in June of 2008 at a tremendous loss to the community. My heartfelt  condolences go out to his family and friends.  And his  family should rest assured  that his  spirit and legacy continue to live on. Mr. Warner began his career in Almont and held various  teaching  and  administrative  positions  within  the district. Mr. Rolland consistently  demonstrated to his students and colleagues  an outstanding capacity for leadership and the  ability  to make  a  positive  difference. He  helped countless young people learn and grow  by challenging  them  to expand  their minds.  His contributions are greatly appreciated, and  I could not think of a better way to show this  gratitude other than by placing his name on  the new school. His  family should be extremely proud of this achievement, and I applaud Mr. Rolland posthumously on this wonderful acknowledgement.  August 27th will be a great day  for  the  Lapeer Community Schools District and for the  City of Lapeer as  they pay  tribute  to Mrs.  Doris Rolland and Mr. Ronald Warner, and I  am pleased to have had the opportunity to do  the same. I want to thank all parties involved  for their hard work during the nomination process. The community can stand proud of these  two individuals as they have their names remembered  forever on  the new  facility. They  are rightfully deserving of this prestigious distinction because they have laid a strong foundation on which to build and expand upon.  In closing,  I offer my encouragement and  best wishes to all the teachers, students and  parents who are a part of the Rolland-Warner  Middle School family. The future is bright and  your potential is limitless. Go Wolves!

ZOE LOFGREN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 23, 2009  ",2009
1269,169,2009-07-24,Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California.," Madam  Speaker, as the Chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation, I rise today to  honor the extraordinary work of Will Kempton,  the current Director of the California Department of Transportation. Mr. Kempton was appointed Director in November of 2004, and in  that capacity, he manages a $13.3 billion  budget for the Department, oversees $10 billion for the improvement of California’s transportation network, and a staff of over 23,000  employees, as well as manages  the day  to  day operations of over 50,000 miles of highway in the State.  As Director, Mr. Kempton has provided  leadership  to  the Department on a broad  range of issues that impact transportation in  the State of California. Some of his many accomplishments over the years include: helping  California to rapidly obligate its share of funds  from  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; overseeing  the passage  and implementation of Proposition 1B in 2006,  which  invested $19 billion  into  the State’s  aging infrastructure; and leading the Caltrans  campaign to deliver 1,088 transportation construction projects valued at $11.5 billion over  the  last half-decade, and delivered 1,087 of  them, or 99.9 percent.  After more  than  three decades of public  service, Mr. Kempton announced that he will  be leaving as Director of the California Department of Transportation at  the end of July,  2009. He has honorably and effectively served  the State of California  in various capacities  throughout his career, including serving as the  Assistant Director of the California Department  of Transportation in charge of Legislative and  Congressional Affairs. Since  joining Caltrans  in 1973, Mr. Kempton has served in various  management  positions  in  the Department  helping him to develop a broad understanding  of transportation programs and policies at all  levels of government.  Mr. Kempton is a San Francisco native, and  received his bachelor’s degree from the University of San Francisco. Mr. Kempton translated his  knowledge of  transportation programs  into  the production arena when, as  Chair of the Santa Clara County Traffic Authority, I helped to hire him as the first Executive Director. During his assignment as Director of  the Santa Clara County effort, Mr.  Kempton mobilized California’s sales tax programs into an effective coalition of ‘‘self help’’  counties. The sales tax program he managed  is widely viewed as one of the most successful ever undertaken in California, resulting in  the delivery of nearly $1 billion dollars in highway improvements in less than 10 years. He  brought in our Santa Clara County ‘‘Measure  A’’  program  under  budget  and  ahead  of  schedule.  Mr. Kempton, who now lives with his wife  Beverly in Folsom, California, served on the  City of Folsom’s Parks and Recreation Commission from 1995 until 2003. He also served  as the City of Folsom Assistant City Manager  for Community Services beginning in January  2003, where he was  responsible  for overseeing the operations of the City’s Community  Development, Neighborhood Services, Parks  and Recreation, Utilities, and Public Works departments.  Will Kempton and I have worked in different  capacities  on  California  Transportation  projects since 1985.  I have met no abler a  public administrator in my career. He is, simply, the best.  On behalf of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation,  I would  like  to  thank  Will Kempton for more than three decades of  public service in the State of California.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

1271,176,2009-07-24,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize a true hometown hero. On  Tuesday, July 14, 2009, while on patrol, Officer W. Thomas Lee of the Smithfield Police  Department  in  Smithfield, North Carolina,  saved a couple and their three children from  an early morning house fire.  Officer Lee was on patrol  just after 2:00  a.m. when he saw a car burning at 1411 W.  Market Street in Smithfield, where Javier Ramirez, Maria Mejia and their children, ages 12  to 18, were sleeping. Lee banged loudly on  the front door and on several windows before  managing to wake the family. The family was  able to exit the structure through a bedroom  window  to avoid moving about  the burning  home. Fortunately, no one was  injured. The  fire had spread  to  the attic and roof of  the  house by the time firefighters arrived just before 2:20 a.m., Smithfield Fire Marshal Paul  Whitehurst said. The blaze began when  the  engine of  the  family’s 2003 Ford Mustang  caught fire. In a statement the family said, ‘‘if  it hadn’t been for the police officer that saw  [the fire], it would have been a very different  situation.’’ Madame Speaker, this is an understatement.  It is first-class citizens like Officer Lee who  highlight  the sense of community and duty  shared by all our  first  responders. These  emergency personnel work tirelessly on behalf  of our communities and I would like to take  this time to recognize their achievements. Officer Lee is truly a hometown hero and I ask my  colleagues to join in congratulating his bravery  and integrity.  HON. J.

Federal funding will allow the construction of  the Vince Carter Sanctuary, a 100-bed substance abuse  treatment, education, and  research center to be located in Bunnell, Florida  (Flagler County) on land donated for this purpose by the Flagler County Commission. This  request seeks to assist in the total financing of  this $8 million project as 80% of  the  total  funds have been generated from local philanthropic contributions. The Vince Carter Sanctuary will  impact  the economy of  the region  and create 75 new jobs to operate the facility.  These new positions will have an average salary of $32,500, thus reflecting over $2.5 million in direct salary expenditures.

Funds will enable TANK to purchase  new buses needed  for safety and capacity  issues. Newer buses will also help to achieve  better fuel economy and have cleaner emissions than the buses currently in use and in  need of replacement. The current buses that  will be replaced have been  in operation  for  one  to  two  years  beyond  their FTA-recommended useful life (13 to 14 years of operation). This project is a good use of taxpayer  funds because it will improve safety, capacity  and energy efficiency.

The project is listed in  Kentucky’s six year highway plan. This project  is a good use of taxpayer funds because it will  improve safety, allow for continued economic  growth  in Northern Kentucky, and employ  workers to complete the project. Importantly,  I–471 will serve as an alternate route when  work begins on repair or replacement of the  Brent Spence Bridge on  I–71/75. Rehabilitation of I–471 is critical to ensuring this redirected  traffic moves  in a  fast and efficient  manner without jeopardizing the safety of travelers. Finally, completing this maintenance will  prolong the life of the road, avoiding necessity  of more costly repairs.  Requesting Member: Congressman GEOFF  DAVIS  Bill Number: H.R. 3298  Account: HUD—Economic Development Initiative  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of  Covington  Address of Requesting Entity: 2300 Madison  Avenue, Covington, KY 41014  Description  of  Request:  Appropriate  $250,000 for the renovation of the old Stewart  Iron Works Building. The City of Covington is  working with  three non-profit social service  agencies (Fairhaven Rescue Mission, Parish  Kitchen, and Welcome House of Northern  Kentucky) to create a multiagency one-stop for  serving the needs of homeless individuals and  families in the Northern Kentucky community.  The project  involves  the rehabilitation of  the  Stewart Iron Works Building, relocation of several existing social service agencies into a single building. This will  increase  the ability  to  provide a full range of services, increase capacity, and provide on-site  transitional housing. This project  is a good use of  taxpayer  funds because  it will  improve  the efficiency  and quality of services for homeless individuals and  families  through an economy of  scale. Demand for these types of services will  only  increase as  the economy continues  to  struggle.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 24, 2009  Mr.  MARIO  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker, I submit the following.  Requesting Member: Representative MARIO  DIAZ-BALART(FL–25)  Bill Number: H.R. 3293  Account: HRSA  Name of Requesting Entity: University of  Miami  Address of Requesting Entity: 1252 Memorial Drive, Ashe Administration Building, Coral  Gables, FL 33146  Description of Request:  I have  secured  $952,000  for  the Pediatric  Integrative Medicine. This funding will be used for the development of a pioneer center of excellence for a  Pediatric Integrative Medicine Model, the following benefits will be realized: The University  of Miami will become a resource for other institutions in the community as well as nationally who are interested in this model of care.  By becoming a center of excellence, our patient population would have the advantage of  receiving the most comprehensive care that is  available nationwide. The  collaboration between CAM practitioners and clinicians can increase  the  respect between  the  two health  care delivery systems; may also establish trust  by eliminating the competition usually occurring between the two fields. The holistic approach of most CAM interventions and therapies can  increase awareness of health and  wellness in children at an early age. With the  impact  that  lifestyle and behavior have on  health, children can reap the benefits of this  early awareness well into adulthood. Through  our Pediatric Integrative Medicine Model, the  University of Miami would be poised to revolutionize pediatric care and advance the use of  CAM as part of standard care. Specific  targeted substudies may include: Water, one of  the most important elements in our bodies yet  one whose intake in children is universally limited. Exploring increased hydration therapy in  children would be an inexpensive home-based  intervention for improving health. Enzyme Deficiency, Implicated as a cause of illness and  as an effecter of health, enzyme deficiencies  can be improved through supplementation with  natural products  such as wheatgrass,  raw  juices and living foods. Ambient Lighting and  Light Therapy, extended hospitalizations  reduce exposure to sunlight, potentially causing  Vitamin D deficiency. Would supplementation  through Vitamin D-rich  foods be effective  in  preventing  this deficiency? Additionally, are  there other adverse health effects of certain  lighting techniques (e.g. fluorescent or flos-fluorescent light)? Probiotics, could probiotics be  useful in maintaining optimal colon health in  children?  If so, are  there dosage considerations  to be explored based on  the significantly smaller size of the colon? Furthermore,  can the use of probiotics reduce recovery time  in hospitalized children? Massage Therapy,  the negative  impacts of stress are present  throughout all age groups in the U.S., but the  data exploring CAM methods for stress reduction  in children  is sparse. Recognizing  the  benefits of massage  in adults and even  in  neonates, could massage be beneficial to children with elevated stress levels (whether that  stress  is psychological or biological such as  that  from chronic diseases)?  Is massage a  significant effecter of biological markers of  stress  (inflammation,  cytokines,  C-reactive  proteins etc.)? Others, exercise, polyunsaturated fatty acids, specific vitamin and other  nutritional  therapies, pediatric health behavior—adherence  to  CAM  therapies  and  changes in mood outcome expectations—the  possibilities are extensive.

1280,211,2009-07-24,Mr. SIMPSON.," Madam Speaker, in accordance with the policies and standards put forth  by the House Appropriations Committee and  the GOP Leadership, I would like to place in  the record a listing of the congressionally-directed projects I have requested in my home  state of Idaho that are contained in the report  of HR 3293,  the FY2010 Labor, Health and  Human Services and Education and Related  Agencies Appropriations:  Project Name: Bear Lake Memorial Hospital  Addition and Remodel  Amount Received: $300,000  Account: Health Resources and Services  Administration Health Facilities and Services  Recipient: Bear Lake Memorial Hospital  Recipient’s Address: 164 South 5th Street,  Montpelier, Idaho 83254  Description: The Bear Lake Memorial Hospital is a key service provider to all individuals  and plays a vital role  in  the community, as  well as provides services to the popular Bear  Lake recreation area. The current Emergency  Department lacks sufficient space for a waiting  room for emergency room patrons. It also fails  to meet HIPPA compliance because of a lack  of privacy for patients due to a high-use public  hallway dissecting  the  two emergency room  locations.  In addition,  the current diagnostic  imaging facilities are scattered throughout the  hospital, which makes it more difficult to provide timely and efficient care. By consolidating  the services into one wing, the hospital will be  able to provide improved patient care and increase overall staff efficiency. Funding provided would be used for the design and construction of a new addition as well as a renovation of the existing facilities in the Emergency Department and Diagnostic  Imaging  Department.  Project Name: College of Southern Idaho’s  Pro-Tech Training Program  Amount Received: $200,000  Account: Department of Education Higher  Education  Recipient: College of Southern Idaho  Recipient’s Address:  315  Falls Avenue,  Twin Falls, ID 83303–1238  Description: This program will enable  the  College to partner with other agencies to identify training needs and to identify potential candidates for employment. Data provided by Region IV of the State of Idaho Economic Development Agency  indicate  that manufacturing  will be a  leading employment area  in  the  Magic Valley and the state of Idaho with over  250 new  jobs expected over  the next  two  years. Current trends in manufacturing development  necessitate  the  need  for  in-depth  training in the technological aspects of the design, fabrication, and manufacturing phases of  production. CSI is participating in a joint educational venture with Twin Falls High School  and local industry that creates a pre-engineering academy at the high school and a Computerized Numeric Controls  (CNC)/Industrial  Networking Program at  the college campus.  The Pro-Tech program volves students  from  grade levels 10–14, and allows the students to  move  from high school  into a  two-year program at CSI or into an engineering program at  one of  Idaho’s  four-year  institutions. At  the  secondary school level, students learn the basics of computer-assisted design, design physics, and fabrication, with each course offering  aligned to the program at CSI through either  tech prep or dual credit affiliation. At the post-  secondary level students will receive industry-  standard  training  in CNC, automated  logic,  and  industrial networking. This program will  train students to meet the educational requirements needed  to enable  them  to enter  the  high demand  fields of  the hi-tech manufacturing and engineering sectors.  Project Name: Custer County Purchase of  Medical Equipment  Amount Received: $400,000  Account: Health Resources and Services  Administration Health Facilities and Services  Recipient: Custer County  Recipient’s Address: 801 East Main Avenue,  Challis, ID 83226  Description: At almost 5,000 square miles,  Custer County is larger than three states yet  has just over 4,000 people. Unfortunately, it is  burdened with a high proportion of public  lands with over 95% of the county’s 3.4 million  acres administered by federal agencies. The  county’s tax base, or more specifically the lack  thereof, is inadequate to support the services  required for such an expansive county. This  grossly  disproportionate  public  ownership  causes a severe strain on their resources, including their ability to provide access to health  services. The influx of tourism and visitors due  to the nearby US Forest Service, BLM, recreation and wilderness areas  leads  to an  increased rate of trauma and accidents, placing  a large burden on the county. The EMT services and health clinics  in  the county are  in  need  of  renovation  and modernization  of  equipment. This funding would be used to purchase the much needed equipment and technology  for  the clinics and EMT services  in  Custer County.  Project Name: Idaho Caring Foundation for  Children  for dental services  for  low-income  children  Amount Received: $300,000  Account: Health Resources and Services  Administration Health Facilities and Services  Recipient: Idaho Caring Foundation for Children  Recipient’s Address: 1211 W. Myrtle, Suite  110, Boise, ID 83702  Description: According to the 2000 U.S. Surgeon General’s report, ‘‘Oral Health in America’’, tooth decay is the single most common  chronic childhood disease. As a dentist, I understand the importance of proper dental hygiene at a very young age. Poor oral health  can affect a child’s self-esteem, ability to eat,  appearance  and  ability  to  communicate.  School attendance can also be negatively impacted. Over 35% of Idaho children lack dental insurance, which serves as a major deterrent in accessing and receiving needed dental  care. According to Idaho Department of Health  and Welfare 2005 Smile Survey, 27% of Idaho  children in grades K–6 had untreated decay.  Low-income,  uninsured  children  suffer  the  greatest  incidence of dental decay because  their families lack the financial resources to receive regular dental care. The  Idaho Caring  Foundation will provide access to needed dental services  for 600  low-income, uninsured  Idaho children. These services will be provided by our network of 140  Idaho dentists  from across the state. Eligible children will be  identified by working in partnership with Idaho  schools, Head Start programs, and other children’s programs, such as the YMCA and the  Boys & Girls Clubs.  Project Name: Idaho Early Literacy Project  Amount Received: $350,000  Account: Department of Education Elementary and Secondary Education  Recipient: Lee Pesky Learning Center  Recipient’s Address:  3324 Elder Street,  Boise, ID 83705.  Description: The aim of the Idaho Early Literacy Project is to ensure that all children in  Idaho are  ready  to  read when  they enter  school. Stage III includes utilization of the research-based booklets, ‘‘Every Child Ready to  Read and Every Child Ready for Math’’, an integrated  approach  to  reading  and mathematical literacy, the training of child care providers statewide, both live and on-line, and a  direct  intervention with parents and children.  The training of child care providers includes a  face-to-face approach in larger population centers and an on-line approach for remote rural  locations. Stage  III builds on early  literacy  training models implemented in 2008–2010 by  unifying reading and mathematical literacy and  by strengthening the intervention with parents  and children. As such, the project assures that  pre-school children will receive direct literacy  education  from child care providers and  in  special workshops with their parents, creating  the  ‘‘language rich’’ upbringing necessary  to  succeed in school.  Project Name: Idaho SySTEMic Solution  Amount Received: $400,000  Account: Department of Education Elementary and Secondary Education  Recipient: Boise State University  Recipient’s Address: 1910 University Drive,  Boise, ID 83725–1135  Description: Idaho SySTEMic Solution is a  nationally  relevant, hands-on, project-based  STEM  learning system (science,  technology,  engineering,  & math)  designed  to  spur  achievement and confidence among elementary-age  learners and  their  teachers. Proven  methods show that long-term student achievement and interest in STEM can be dramatically improved by introducing systemic, contiguous, and engaging hands-on activities at an  elementary level before children develop misconceptions, gender bias, math anxiety, or become distracted by cultural influences prevalent at puberty. In 2010 the project will extend  into middle school grades where the need for  hands-on  activities  is  even  greater.

Requesting Member: Congressman TODD  RUSSELLPLATTS(PA–19)  Bill Number: H.R. 3293—Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act  (1) York College of Pennsylvania—Facilities  and Equipment—$300,000  Account: Higher Education, FIPSE  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: York College of Pennsylvania  Address of Requesting Entity: 441 Country  Club Road, York, PA 17403  Description of Request/Justification of Federal Funding: York College of Pennsylvania is  a private, four-year institution of higher education serving over 5,600 students. This is a  good use of taxpayer funds because York College would use  this  funding  to expand  their  existing  Nursing  Department.  Specifically,  funds would be used to refurbish laboratories  and purchase equipment related to the project.  This is also a good use of taxpayer funds because York College operates one of the largest bachelorette nursing programs in the region. York College’s ability  to continue providing a pool of highly educated and trained  nursing graduates helps fill the critical demand  for nurses, both locally and nationally.  (2) Hanover Hospital—Electronic Medical  Records Initiative—$450,000  Account: HRSA, Health Facilities and Services  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Hanover  Hospital  Address of Requesting Entity: 300 Highland  Avenue, Hanover, PA 17331  Description of Request/Justification of Federal Funding: Hanover Hospital would use this  funding  to convert all paper  records at  the  hospital to an electronic medical record system. This is a good use of taxpayer dollars because the use of such records is proven to improve clinical outcomes and enables health  systems  to better define, measure, monitor,  and  reward quality care. Electronic medical  records create efficiencies for patients, physicians, and the hospital.

This  bakery with a social conscience has helped  the homeless and HIV-positive of Chicago by  creating jobs, teaching skills, and giving back  to the community.  Sweet Miss Giving’s  arose  to  give  the  homeless and disabled of Chicago an opportunity  to obtain practical skills  through  real  world working experience. The bakery gives  participants a place to work after completing  job training so they may gain the confidence  and talent enabling them to find work in the future. Their decadent baked goods are currently being sold at dozens of local businesses  and restaurants around Chicago and over fifty  percent of proceeds are donated to Chicago  House, the first provider of AIDS housing in  the Midwest.

Columbus was recognized for its low jobless  rate with its industry and manufacturing infrastructure providing employment for more than  5,700. Columbus is home to major agricultural  equipment companies and the Nebraska Public Power District. Glur’s Tavern, the oldest bar  west of the Missouri River reminds residents  of the days when Buffalo Bill Cody frequented  the area.  Money Magazine took note of Norfolk’s public school system. The 13 schools in the K12  district are relatively diverse,  teacher-student  ratios are often under 1:20, and  the  ‘‘Challenge’’ program offers differentiated instruction  for academically talented children. It was also  pointed out that Norfolk is a major retail trade  center for northeast Nebraska, and the manufacturing  industry  in  the city employs more  than 4,000 people.  These designation weren’t accidents. Columbus and Norfolk are strong communities of  people who care for each other, who help out  during hard  times, and who  live up  to  the  benchmarks set by our forefathers.  So, congratulations to Columbus and Norfolk for representing Nebraska and making us  proud.  f  OLAJU ‘‘O.J.’’ GREEN  HON.

O.J. was a not only an excellent student in  the classroom, but was also a  leader and  standout athlete  for Canal Winchester High  School’s Football Team. He was both dedicated and hardworking,  leading his  football  team to qualify for the state playoffs.  In addition  to his successes  in  the classroom and on the football field, he was also a  great artist. I met O.J. through his participation  in the 7th Congressional District Art Show. His  pencil drawing submitted for the art show was  thought provoking and clearly showed his talent. It was an honor for me to meet this bright,  well-rounded and articulate young man.  My thoughts and prayers are with the family  and friends during this time of terrible loss.

Art Therapy Connection teaches students to  deal with negative emotions and hardship  through the use of creative outlets, which have  consistently  rendered  them better behaved,  more focused and more successful in school.  Art therapy helps raise children’s self-esteem  by encouraging self-expression and providing  them the opportunity to work through their behavioral and social problems  in a  fun, motivating way. In addition, Art Therapy Connection brings art to schools that have cut it from  the curriculum through the Visiting Artist Program that connects students to artists in the  community.  Art Therapy Connection has grown each  year,  reaching out weekly  to over 150 students at five different grade schools and high  schools in the 2008–2009 school year and is  still expanding. I would like to honor Art Therapy Connection for working tirelessly to make  art therapy available to as many students as  possible.

1291,232,2009-07-24,Mr. GARY G.," MILLER of California. Madam  Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting  the following information regarding earmarks I  received as part of  the FY 2010 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development  Appropriations Bill.  Requesting Member: Congressman GARY  G. MILLER  Bill Number: H.R. 3288  Account: FTA, Buses and Bus Facilities  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of  Anaheim  Address of Requesting Entity: 200 South  Anaheim  Boulevard,  Anaheim,  California  92805  Funding Secured: $725,000  Description of Request: The Anaheim Regional  Transportation  Intermodal  Center  (ARTIC)  will  be  the  premier  regional  multimodal  transportation  hub  in  Orange  County, located on a 16-acre site in the City  of Anaheim, strategically situated along  the  Los Angeles to San Diego (LOSSAN) rail line,  bounded by State Route 57, and  in close  proximity  to  the  Interstate 5  freeway. The  ARTIC will establish both physical and functional linkage to provide seamless access between all transit modes. The ARTIC is needed  to accommodate the travel needs of 45 million  visitors and will strategically facilitate bus rapid  transit  service,  proposed  California  High  Speed Rail alignment, as well as the Anaheim  to Ontario International Airport segment of the  California-Nevada  Interstate super speed rail  project. The project will also expand existing  transportation  infrastructure  for Amtrak  intercity rail, Metrolink commuter rail,  fixed-route  and express bus services, taxi and Anaheim  Resort shuttles, as well as private  transportation providers such as Greyhound. The City  of Anaheim is completing this project in conjunction with  the Orange County Transportation Authority and once complete, will act as  an integral hub serving millions of travelers in  and out of the Southern California region.  Requesting Member: Congressman GARY  G. MILLER  Bill Number: H.R. 3288  Account: FTA, Capital Investment Grants  Legal  Name  of  Requesting  Entity:  Omnitrans  Address of Requesting Entity: 1700 West  5th Street, San Bernardino, California 92411  Funding Secured: $32,370,000  Description of Request: The introduction of  premium  transit modes and services  in  the  San Bernardino Valley corridors in the future  will allow Omnitrans to achieve better market  penetration, while being able to positively influence the livability of communities in its service  area. The faster, more direct transit service of  Bus Rapid System (BRT) has proven beneficial to many communities around the country.  Therefore the study has selected the following  seven major  transit  corridors  within  the  Omnitrans service area: (1) E Street; (1a) E  Street Extension; (2) Foothill Boulevard East;  (3) Foothill Boulevard West; (4) Mountain/Euclid Avenues; (5) San Bernardino Avenue; (6)  Holt Avenue/4th Street; and (7) Grand/Edison  Avenues. These seven corridors,  two north/  south and five east/west, cover much of the  developed  land within  the service area and  form a grid which will allow direct transfers between lines if an entire system of fast premium  services  is  implemented  by  Omnitrans.  Omnitrans is currently moving forward with the  E Street Corridor, and a plan is needed for the  remaining corridors.  Requesting Member: Congressman GARY  G.

It manages  the development and preservation of high quality affordable housing throughout the country, including  development of new affordable housing, preservation of existing affordable housing at risk  of going to market rate, and full service construction management with expertise in multifamily and mixed use development. This community opportunity program has been absolutely invaluable in helping to provide affordable housing for more American families and  in promoting increased homeownership in the  United States. For every dollar of public funding,  National  Community  Renaissance  leverages nine dollars of private funds to support its goals of affordable housing. Over the  past several years, Congress has continually  supported National Community Renaissance’s  program  of  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  and  preservation of at-risk affordable housing by  appropriating funds from the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program  account. Federal  funding would be used  for  the acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation  of at-risk affordable housing.  Requesting Member: Congressman GARY  G. MILLER  Bill Number: H.R. 3288  Account: Economic Development Initiative  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Hillview  Acres Children’s Home  Address of Requesting Entity: 3683 Chino  Avenue, Chino, California 91710  Funding Secured: $250,000  Description of Request: Established in 1929,  Hillview Acres Children’s Home cares for severely abused and neglected children throughout the greater Los Angeles area. Using four  cottages that house no more than nine children each, Hillview provides 24-hour residential and mental health treatment services for  abused boys and girls ages six through eighteen. The Home’s main activities include complete  assessment  services  and  psychiatric  care,  a  state-certified  nonpublic  school,  a  Family Reunification Program, and a home for  pregnant teens and teenage mothers. One of  the biggest challenges Hillview  faces  today,  however, is its aging physical plant. Built with  volunteer labor over forty years ago, the physical appearance of the campus no longer mirrors the services provided. The renewal of the  campus is vital to showing the children they  are worthy of a safe and caring home. Hillview  Acres has benefited from congressional support  in previous  fiscal years and continued  federal  funding of  this public-private partnership is necessary, however, to allow Hillview  to uphold its mission in receiving, treating, and  caring for thousands of severely abused and  neglected children.

1292,2,2009-07-31,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  this morning to recognize the 150th anniversary of my childhood parish, St.  Columban Roman Catholic Church of  Loveland, Ohio.  In  1859,  Father  John  Baptist  O’Donoghue, of St. Andrew’s Parish in  Milford, and  10  families worked  together to raise enough money to purchase an old, one-room  schoolhouse  from the Village of Loveland on Broadway Avenue.  Like many  budding  parishes,  the  original rectory did not meet the needs  of the local Catholic community for  very long. In 1893, St. Columban built  their second house of worship on that  site. A few years later, the first school  was built. This church will always hold  a special place in my heart because my  home was built from its bricks.  As  the parish was celebrating  its  100th anniversary, St. Columban was,  once again, forced to expand to a new  church at a different site. I was in attendance that day 50 years ago when  Archbishop Karl J. Alter dedicated the  new school building which housed the  church in the cafeteria. Rapid growth  twice required separate additions to be  built to house the church. In 2002, the  church finally moved out of the school  and into its own building.  Each year, I have the privilege to  host  the St. Columban eighth-grade  students to the Capitol. I am honored  to be their Congresswoman and tour  guide.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in  celebrating St. Columban’s 150th anniversary and in wishing them continued  success.  God bless them. God bless the United  States of America.  f  COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION TO  PROMOTE WELLNESS  (Mrs. DAHLKEMPER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2009
1293,2,2009-07-31,Mrs. DAHLKEMPER.," Mr. Speaker,  during the upcoming August work period, my colleagues and I will travel  back to our districts to talk about  meaningful health care  reform  that  fixes what is broken and that protects  what works.  One of the things that does not work  is the skyrocketing costs of medical  treatment in the United States. If Congress  is  serious about  tackling  the  issue, we must address the growing  concern of  chronic disease—preventable conditions that account for 85 percent of total health spending. Obesity  alone cost $147 billion last year.  Today, I am introducing legislation  that will offer up to 20 percent discounted premiums to those who make  the effort to live healthier lifestyles,  such as not smoking, such as achieving  and maintaining normal body mass  index and working at lowering blood  pressure and cholesterol levels. As a result, there will be an economic incentive to encourage personal responsibility for one’s health, which will dramatically reduce overall costs.  As we look at health insurance reform, we need to make sure that we  look at encouraging wellness. I urge  my colleagues to join me in support of  this commonsense legislation to promote wellness.  f  IN APPRECIATION OF ALLEN  AIMAR  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to wish a fond  farewell to a member of the Second  Congressional  District  staff,  Allen  Aimar.  Allen first served as a field representative in our Beaufort Lowcountry office before coming to Washington as  military legislative assistant. Allen is  leaving Washington behind for his law  school career at Capital University in  Columbus, Ohio. He will be joined by  his wife, Amber, who previously served  on the staff of the Second District and  as staff to Dr. Phil Roe.  Allen has been vital in helping constituents,  particularly  on military  issues. He has brought his own experience and knowledge as a veteran of the  Army National Guard in Iraq. He appreciates  our  servicemembers,  their  families and veterans.  Allen is the son of Allen and Deborah  Aimar of Johnson City, Tennessee, and  of Greg and Marian Erickson of Beaufort, South Carolina, and is brother to  Adam Aimar.  We are all tremendously proud of  Allen and Amber, and we wish them  and their young son, Alexander Jacob  Aimar, all the best  in the years to  come. Godspeed to the Aimar family.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  (Mr. MCGOVERN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2009
1294,2,2009-07-31,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, as we  debate health care reform legislation,  my Republican friends say things are  fine just the way they are. ‘‘Take two  tax breaks and call me in the morning,’’ is their prescription. This in spite  of the fact that premiums have doubled  in 9 years, growing three times faster  than wages; this in spite of the fact  that the average American family already pays an extra $1,100 a year in premiums to support a broken system;  this in spite of the fact that 46 million  Americans are uninsured.  When my Republican friends say that  the American  people  don’t  deserve  health reform, my response is: Are you  kidding?  f  KATRINA ANNIVERSARY  (Mr. CAO asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
1295,2,2009-07-31,Mr. CAO.," Mr. Speaker, August 29,  2009 will mark the fourth anniversary  of Hurricane Katrina. As I prepare to  return to the Second District, I am reflective not so much of the unprecedented damage that wreaked havoc on  the innocent but of the power of the  human spirit that was so evident in  every citizen as they’ve returned to  New Orleans to rebuild their homes and  to jump-start their communities.  I, too, lost everything in this storm.  My wife and I, like so many others,  were forced to start over after losing  our home and business.  As Katrina became the byword for  our Nation’s social  ills and  failures,  many even questioned the logic of rebuilding, but one only has  to  look  around New Orleans and Jefferson Parish today to completely dispute that  line of reasoning. New Orleans and Jefferson Parish are reemerging as the  productive areas they once were. Tourism  is back on the rise, and entrepreneurs are returning to reintroduce  commerce and to boost the job market.  But there is still much work to do.  The Stafford Act must be redesigned  to bring a systemic means of Federal  natural disaster assistance  for State  and local governments to aid citizens,  and  there must  be  a  fundamental  change in FEMA’s approach to catastrophic disasters.  f  A UNIQUELY AMERICAN HEALTH  CARE PLAN  (Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",2009
1296,2,2009-07-31,Ms. EDWARDS  of Maryland.," Mr.  Speaker, today, it is time for health  care reform.  Now, there are some out there who  like to claim that we don’t need reform  now because the private marketplace  will take care of everything. Well, the  private marketplace hasn’t taken care  of  anything  except  to  increase  deductibles, to increase premiums, and  to increase copays that cost the American people. Let me tell you what that  means in my home State of Maryland.  In 2001, if you were paying on the average of $600 a month for your health  care, today, you’re paying an average  of $1,000 a month for your health care.  Well, I don’t know about anybody else,  but in my household, an extra $400 a  month is real money. It’s groceries. It’s  an electric bill. It’s daycare. I mean,  this is an important cost to the American people.

1297,9,2009-07-31,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  time of the gentleman has again expired.  ,2009
1298,9,2009-07-31,Mr. BACHUS.," I yield myself 1 additional minute.  These are the same government agencies that regulated AIG, Countrywide,  and collectively failed to prevent the  worst  financial  calamity  since  the  Great Depression. If it took them 30  years to catch Bernie Madoff, do you  really think the SEC can do a better  job of  identifying  inappropriate risk  than the vast majority of financial institution executives whose businesses  have  remained  solvent during  these  challenging  times? Really,  now,  is  there any question who is better qualified or, for that matter, who ought to  be responsible  for setting compensation within an American corporation?  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this bill continues the Democrat majority’s tendency to go to the default solution for  every problem: create a government  bureaucracy to make decisions better  left to private citizens and private corporations. That’s what we did in cap-  and-trade. That’s what we did in the  health care proposals. And it’s this bill  on  executive  compensation. Government bureaucrats do not know what’s  best for America.  For those reasons, Mr. Speaker,  urge opposition to this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
1299,9,2009-07-31,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes to  deal with some of these comments.  First of all, I am struck by the fact  that the gentleman, as he indicated in  our markup,  is  sufficiently nervous  about the political implications of opposing this bill and having the House  take no action whatsoever to deal with  the problem of risk-incentivizing bonuses but he wants to debate cap-and-  trade and health care. They’re not before us. What’s before us is this bill.  And when Members debate the bills  that aren’t there,  it’s an  indication  that they’re a little shaky on the bills  that are there.  Secondly, yes, it does say that they  can deal with all wages but not in general. The gentleman reads very selectively. The language about taking action is in this context: to determine  whether the compensation structure is  aligned with sound risk management,  is structured to account for the time  horizon of risks, and will reduce unreasonable incentives by such institutions  for employees to take undue risks.  It is limited in its grant of authority  only to structures that incentivize excessive risk. There is no mandate here  to set wages for anybody. There is no  mandate to say this percentage is bonuses and that percentage is pay. It is  a mandate only to act where the structure incentivizes risk, as has been recognized as part of the problem, very  broadly.  I will plead guilty to one issue, yes.  We are not in this case taking orders  from the Obama administration. And  maybe having represented a party that  took orders from the Bush administration, they now wish they didn’t, but  that’s not an example I want to follow.  I am not here as a Member of Congress  or as chairman of a committee to do  whatever the administration says. I am  here  for us to put our  independent  judgment on it.  The gentleman closed with the key  difference between us: the Republican  position, as he articulates  it—and  I  don’t think it will be the unanimous  position—is have the Federal Government take no action whatsoever to restrain the granting of bonuses that  incentivize excessive risk. If they pay  back that TARP money having benefited from it—and, by the way, on the  bailout, every single bailout now underway happened under the Bush administration. But their position is, do  nothing to deal with this. We take the  opposite position.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
1300,9,2009-07-31,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. BARRETT).  Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  of H.R. 3269, the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness  Act of 2009.  Restoring confidence in our financial  markets  is  crucial, Mr. Speaker, a  component in bringing about economic  recovery. And I support efforts to responsibly address the issues that led to  the financial crisis that we’re facing  today.  However, H.R. 3269 does not do either.  Instead  of  addressing  the need  for  smarter regulation, this bill represents  further government intrusion into the  private sector that could ultimately  hinder economic recovery. If this legislation is passed, it will put in place far-  reaching and permanent government  regulations on the compensation practices of financial institutions, crippling  their ability to recruit top talent and  remain competitive abroad and here at  home.  Mr. Speaker, this bill goes too far by  giving the Federal Government the authority to make compensation decisions for a wide range of employees in  thousands of financial firms across the  United States, which we can all agree  is a far cry from just capping executive  pay.  In tough economic times like these,  we need to focus on ways to restore  confidence in America’s financial markets and increase the ability of American  businesses  through  responsible  policies that restore market discipline  and discourage excessive risk. I firmly  believe that we cannot have a successful economic recovery with the permanent overreaching regulations that this  puts in place by this legislation.  I therefore urge my colleagues to join  me in voting ‘‘no’’ on this legislation.  ",2009

1302,9,2009-07-31,Mr. SCOTT of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  let me just start out by saying this.  We’re hearing  complaints  from  the  other side that we are taking over the  private enterprise system; we are taking over the free enterprise system.  Let me remind them that it wasn’t  us that went to the private enterprise  system. It wasn’t the government that  went to Wall Street. Wall Street came  to the government to bail them out  from their behaviors.  Now, Mr. Speaker,  the American  landscape  is absolutely  littered with  company after company that has been  driven into the ground by executives  who were greedy, who were  selfish,  cared  only  about  themselves, with  these huge salaries, and these companies are left to wither on the vine after  they have gotten their golden parachutes and have landed elsewhere.  Somebody needs to say something  about the American people. This is a  free enterprise system, but it’s not just  free  for top executives. It’s  free  for  shareholders. It’s free for those men  and women who have given their lives,  their blood,  their  sweat, and  their  tears. And to see their companies in  shambles because of excessive pay by  executives who have abandoned those  companies, what about their pensions?  What  about  their  retirements  that  have gone?  No, Mr. Speaker, this is not about  taking over the private enterprise system. Mr. Speaker, this is about saving  and protecting the free enterprise system so that we all can be free to participate in this system.  Mr. Speaker, what we have before us  here is something because of the fact  that financial firms put together compensation packages and bonuses that  were based on  incentives, that were  laden with excessive risk, that caused  our financial crisis and brought this  economy to the edge of collapse and  caused us here in Congress to go and  get over $2 trillion of the American  taxpayers’ money to bail them out.  Now, the first order of business—and  this  is why this bill that Chairman  has pushed, and I’m proud to  say that we worked on this together  over 3 years ago. Had we had that bill  in place 3 years ago, we might not have  had this  financial crisis, because we  would have been able to rein in the  risky corporate behavior that brought  about the collapse. So that’s what we  are doing. We’re putting forward some  reasonable means here.  What is more reasonable than giving  the shareholders a simple say, a vote?  It’s nonbinding. We are not setting the  salaries. Even the shareholders are not.  But don’t they have a right? Isn’t it  their company? They are the ones that  are pumping the money into it.  The other feature about the bill, Mr.  Speaker, that is very simple, very reasonable, is that we require these compensation  committees  that  are  on  these boards to be independent. Right  now it’s a cozy relationship. The CEO  refers to them as his board. They’re  FRANK VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:05 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H31JY9.REC H31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
1303,16,2009-07-31,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3269.  This misguided legislation will do nothing to  restore confidence  in our  financial markets  and could, in fact, undermine our nation’s economic recovery.  The bill directs federal financial regulators to  literally prohibit compensation arrangements it  deems  ‘‘inappropriate.’’ But when did  it become appropriate for the federal government  to take on this role?  How can we not expect  this  to stifle  the  global competitiveness so vital  to American  companies? When American companies are  subjected  to  rigid pay structures as set by  government bureaucrats and  companies  in  other nations are  free  to  follow  the market,  common sense tells us that America’s top talent will go elsewhere.  Furthermore,  the bill  requires an annual  shareholder vote—a non-binding vote—on executive compensation, which seems  terribly  impractical and complex and may only exacerbate problems, not  fix  them. We’re heading  down the same road the trial lawyers have led  us in the courts, and experience tells us that  that road leads to a distorted market.  We’ve heard from groups across the nation  on  this—from  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than three million American businesses and organizations,  to  the United Brotherhood  of Carpenters  union. They all say that requiring them to hold  an annual shareholder vote on compensation  is overly burdensome and could actually diminish proper due diligence by investors.  On average, most companies already approve these packages once every three years.  The Republican alternative, which  I support,  would honor this real-world practice. Our substitute would also allow shareholders  to opt  out of the shareholder triennial advisory vote if  two-thirds vote to do so. This gives the shareholders more flexibility to decide whether they  actually want this ‘‘say on pay.’’ This is real  empowerment of the shareholders—not just lip  service.  Finally, our substitute strikes the section of  the bill which directs government bureaucrats  to determine the compensation arrangements  of private companies rather than its board and  shareholders.  No one on our side of the aisle is for freewheeling pay practices or  lack of oversight.  But, we are calling for balance. We support an  alternative that would preserve American competitiveness while ensuring real transparency  and disclosure over compensation packages.  The majority’s legislation is sound-bite governance at best, extending onerous  regulatory  burdens that have little more than the appearance of actual empowerment of American  shareholders.  ",2009
1304,16,2009-07-31,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, many Americans  are justly outraged that Wall Street firms that  came hat in hand to receive bailouts from the  federal government rewarded their executives  with lavish bonuses. But while holding those financial firms accountable to the taxpayers is a  laudable aim, the legislation before us, H.R.  3269, goes far beyond this.  This is not the first time that Congress has  meddled  in matters of executive compensation, and unfortunately it will not be the last.  Just  like Congress’ meddling with  the economy, each intervention creates unseen problems which, when they crop up, are again addressed by legislation that creates further unseen problems, thus continuing the cycle ad  infinitum. Problems with executive compensation cannot be addressed by further burdensome legislation.  The Wall Street bailouts have already given  the  federal government  too much power  in  corporate boardrooms, and H.R. 3269 is yet  another step  in  the wrong direction. While  shareholder votes on compensation may be  non-binding now, once the precedent of government intervention on behalf of shareholders  is set, there is no reason to believe that these  votes will not become binding in the future.  Perhaps even more  frustrating  is  that enforcement of the provisions of this bill will be  undertaken by overpaid bureaucrats who lack  the skills to earn comparable salaries in the  marketplace by providing useful products or  services desired by consumers. People who  shuttle between federal regulator and federally  regulated firms, trading on their political connections and epitomizing  the corruption endemic  to  the government-managed  financial  system, will be making decisions  that affect  every single public company in this country.  In order to understand the reasons behind  excessive executive compensation, we need  to take a look at the root causes. The salaries  and bonuses raising  the most  ire are  those  from the financial sector, the sector which directly benefits  from  the Federal Reserve’s  loose monetary policy. Loose monetary policy  leads  to speculative bubbles which drive up  stock prices and enrich executives who cash  in their stock options. It makes debt cheaper,  which encourages  reckless business expansion. And  it shuttles money  from  industries  that produce valuable products and services to  industries that are favored by the federal government. H.R. 3269 is a well-intended but misguided piece of legislation. Until we strike at  the root of the problem, we will never get our  financial system back on a firm footing.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3269, the  ‘‘Corporate  and  Financial  Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009’’. I would like  to thank my colleague Representative BARNEY  FRANK for introducing this resolution, as well  as the cosponsors.  I stand in support of this important resolution, because  it  is designed  to address  the  perverse  incentives  in  compensation plans  that encourage executives  in  large  financial  firms to take excessive risk at the expense of  their  companies,  shareholders,  employees,  and ultimately  the American  taxpayer—risks  that contributed  to  the  recent  financial collapse.  One of the solutions it offers is practically  the manifestation of common sense itself—let  the stockholders of the company, the people  the corporate executives are supposed to be  working for, have a say in how those executives should be compensated. For example,  the bill requires shareholder non-binding votes  on so-called ‘‘golden parachutes.’’ It requires  publicly-traded corporations  to allow shareholders to take non-binding votes during annual meetings on the top five executive compensation packages. And it allows SEC to exempt small companies  from  the nonbinding  vote requirement if it finds such an exemption  necessary.  The bill also seeks to change the incentives  for the sort of financial firms that brought our  economy  to  the brink of collapse, so  that  those who manage the money of our countrymen are not even tempted to take us back to  that precipice. The bill authorizes  the SEC,  along with  the  federal  financial  regulatory  agencies, to develop regulations for financial  firms with at least $1 billion in assets that proscribe  the use of employee  compensation  structures that pose a risk to financial institutions and the broader economy. It also specifically, authorizes the regulations to restrict or  prohibit  ‘‘inappropriate or  imprudently  risky  compensation practices’’ at these large financial firms, and further requires financial firms  with at least $1 billion in assets to disclose to  the federal regulators any compensation structures that include incentive-based elements.  The bill does not require disclosure of any  individuals’  compensation  information;  nor  does it allow government pre-approval of anyone’s compensation. Rather, the bill is the first  step towards enacting comprehensive financial  regulatory reform to make sure we never face  another historic  financial crisis  that depletes  the retirement savings of millions, locks businesses out of much-needed credit, and threatens the entire economy.  Finally,  the bill requires  the compensation  committees of the Boards of Directors of public companies to be made up of independent  directors.  It  further requires  that  these compensation  consultants  satisfy  independence  criteria established by the SEC. I would also  point out  that  this bill will,  in practice, only  apply to companies already sufficiently large  enough—it specifically allows the SEC to exempt small companies from the non binding  vote requirement if it finds such an exemption  necessary.  Not only is this bill common sense personified, it is also long overdue. Corporate culture  has, in the past three decades, undergone a  transformation for the worse, where the most  economically powerful have come to see, not  just stockholder profit, but short term profit, as  the greatest good. Today,  the people with  most economic influence see little or no incentive in seeking anything but the next bonus.  It was not always so—from the end of World  War II until the mid 1990s, prominent public  and private company CEOs almost universally  viewed their responsibilities as being equally  split among shareholders, employees, customers, and the Nation. This broad sense of  corporate responsibility was actually so widely  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:05 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H31JY9.REC H31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
1305,23,2009-07-31,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, today I’ve heard a number of interesting accusations about what this legislation would do  if passed.  I have  heard that the government will sit in  board rooms and set caps on pay. But  of course my constituents are accustomed to hearing these kinds of false  arguments  from  those who wish  to  maintain the status quo.  My constituents sent me to Congress  to move beyond the status quo of a broken  financial  regulatory  structure.  They sent me to enact commonsense  reforms like those included in the legislation we’re discussing  today, Mr.  Speaker. They know that average families have cut back, work longer hours,  and have saved their money during this  crisis. Meanwhile, Wall Street execs  have acted irresponsibly and enjoy the  lavish  compensation  packages  that  have allowed their companies to fail.  So I am proud to be an original cosponsor of  this bill  that will bring  about a new era of responsibility on  Wall Street. I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining and who will be closing?  ",2009

1311,23,2009-07-31,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Did  the gentleman not notice  that Mr.  PRICEhad the right to close because he  was defending the committee on the  amendment that I offered?  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I yield  myself the remaining 3 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, the  final question,  I  guess, is who do we trust. Who do we  trust to deal with the situation of pay?  The gentleman  just  spoke on  the  floor with regard to protecting the interests of his constituents. You know,  it doesn’t really matter who your constituents are, whether they are the  CEO at the top of the ladder, someone  in between, the receptionist, anywhere  along the line as far as pay scale, this  bill will affect them and will affect  their ability as far as what their compensation is. It will affect the ability of  the Federal Government  to  dictate  what their compensation will be. Government bureaucrats will be making  those decisions in the future as opposed  to the people involved with the company. Large income or small, bureaucrats will be the ones at hand to make  those final decisions.  The odd thing about this legislation,  as we read through it and as you look  at our amendment to try to address  this problem, is that the underlying  bill gives with one hand and takes with  the other. As has been previously indicated, it gives with one hand in a tacit  approach to say that the shareholders  should be able to make these decisions,  but then it takes that right back again  when it says, then, When the government decides that those shareholders  made an incorrect decision, some bureaucrat at the SEC or the Federal Reserve or someplace else will overrule  that decision and  take  that power  away from them.  It says in the committee, on the one  hand, that States should have some say  in some aspects of  financial service  regulation matters, such as with the  VFPA, where they do not want to preempt State rights, but here they want  to step in and preempt those States,  States that may have had a long history of dealing with such situations as  executive pay compensation, or States  that may want to address it in the future, but the underlying bill says that  they will preempt that.  That is why we have come up with an  alternative. We have come up with a  solution. We are not the ‘‘party of no,’’  we are the party of reform, a party  that says we should address this on a  longer period of time, a party that says  that we should allow the shareholders  to be able to decide these  issues, a  party that says that when it comes to  compensation, the Federal Government  should not be intermeddling.  Now, there was an article in The New  York Times recently. It quoted from  Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist  and former Vice Chairman of the Fed  who wrote recently for the Wall Street  Journal with regard to this. He said,  The executives, lawyers, and accountants who design compensation systems  are imaginative, skilled, and definitely  not disinterested. Congress and government bureaucrats won’t beat them at  their own game. Congress has tried to  do this in the past when they set the  issue with regard to deductibility for  executive compensation at $1 million.  It had the unintended consequence of  setting $1 million as the floor, and Wall  Street then went from compensation  packages greatly exceeding this. We  may well see the same thing with this  underlying legislation as well.  In the headlines that I started the  hour out with, Bank Bonuses $33 Billion, money that is actually coming  from  the  very  taxpayers who  are  watching us here right now, this underlying legislation will not change that.  Despite the fact that the gentleman  from Texas tried to limit this legislation to try to address this legislation  to situations as TARP companies, this  legislation will not solve this. Our substitute will.  Our substitute will return the power  to the individual. It will return the  power to the corporation and, most importantly,  return  the power  to  the  shareholder and take it from the government bureaucrat.  ",2009
1312,23,2009-07-31,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I yield  our remaining time to a leading member of the committee, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER).  ",2009
1313,23,2009-07-31,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the comments of my friend  from New Jersey, but I would say the  word that comes to mind is ‘‘amnesia.’’  My friends on the Republican side of  the aisle have amnesia. They have amnesia over how the Bush administration  tried  to deregulate everything,  tried to make government smaller and  more ineffective so that we could have  Ponzi schemes as existed under Madoff.  That occurred under the George Bush  administration. We had  the  failure  with Katrina, and we had the biggest  collapse in the banking sector ever because of deregulation and a belief that  the free market could do anything it  wanted to do.  Now, this bill is very mild. What it  allows, Mr. Speaker, is it allows shareholders to have a say on what the officers of the company make in terms of  salary, the owners having a say on pay.  What could be more American and  more free enterprise than that?  What it does allow is the board of directors to overrule the shareholders if  they think that’s appropriate. But we  need to have the ownership of the company have a say on what their executives make so that it doesn’t get out of  line and that there is no back-scratching going on.

I have dealers in my district in northeast Georgia who probably are going to go bankrupt because  of these problems. I hope, as we go forward, that we’ll fix these administrative snafus that are in this problem.  We’re throwing money into another  government program that has very serious problems where dealers can’t get  their money. I have one dealer who has  paid out of his pocket for 50 cars but  has only gotten money back for one.  Now, that dealer, if he doesn’t get paid  back, is going to have very severe financial problems, and his employees  are going to be put out of work if we  don’t fix this.  Certainly, we’ve sold a lot of cars because of this program, but just throwing money into a program that has tremendous administrative, red tape problems and other problems is not going  to be the long-term answer. I hope that  the administration will straighten out  these administration snafus and will  get the money to our dealers, money  that they desperately need.  ",2009

The Cash  for  Clunkers program has breathed  life  into a very difficult economy in communities all around my district. Here  is why this is important:  I’ve talked to car dealers in my district. They can’t keep cars on the lots.  They will be ordering new cars from  manufacturers in my State and from  around the country. Suppliers who supply parts for those cars will be manufacturing more of them. This is very,  very critical, and it has been very effective in turning around our economy  in just a matter of days.

For one car company, 78 percent of  the cars that they’re buying are over 30  miles a gallon and 39 percent above 30  miles per gallon. The American people  have seen spectacular improvements in  efficiency and  in environmental performance.

Between now and  then, it’s pretty obvious that this bill  could not have been on the floor today  if it had not been for an emergency designation that would allow us to exercise ourselves in this fashion.  I would remind ourselves one more  time of the quote received from a car  dealer in New York.

1330,30,2009-07-31,Mr. OBEY.," I yield myself the remainder of the time.  Mr. Speaker, today, the Commerce  Department just issued figures which  have indicated that the depth of the recession in the last quarter of last year  was much more severe than anyone had  estimated. This is the good news part  of the day: They also tell us that, in  the  first quarter of  this year,  the  shrinkage of  the economy has now  slowed considerably, which is a very  hopeful sign, because the economy, evidently, performed significantly better  than most of the economic experts had  thought it would perform. We all welcome that news, but as you know, that  is not good enough. We need to see  more progress. Our dilemma is this:  Ordinarily in a recession, when the  country is losing jobs, the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, and that  helps the housing  industry to move  ahead. It helps the auto industry to  sell cars. Our economy is normally led  out of the recession by the housing industry and by the auto industry. This  time around, the situation is very different, because those two sectors have  been basket cases for the past year and  a half.  The first glimmer of hope we’ve seen  in the auto industry is the news that  we received yesterday from the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. LAHOOD,  who informed us that, in just 3 days’  time, when the program was started, as  far as they can tell, it’s already oversubscribed. That means the consumers  like this program; it means they are  reacting to it, and it means that it  would be irresponsible of us not to try  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:05 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H31JY9.REC H31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

Aronovitz United  States Courthouse’’.  Judge Sidney M. Aronovitz served as a U.S.  District Court Judge for the Southern District  of Florida for 21 years. Aronovitz was born in  Key West, Florida, on June 20, 1920. After  graduating  from Key West High School  in  1937, he went on to attend the University of  Florida where he was awarded a bachelor of  arts degree in 1942, and a law degree, with  honors, in 1943. Aronovitz went on to serve as  a U.S. Army captain from 1943 to 1946, earning multiple distinctions,  including a Bronze  Star.  Between 1943 and 1976, Aronovitz served  as a lawyer in private practice in Miami, Florida. He also served as a City Commissioner  from 1962  to 1966, holding  the position of  Vice-Mayor in 1965. In 1976, President Gerald  Ford nominated Sidney M. Aronovitz to serve  as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Aronovitz was  commissioned on September 21, 1976, and  served as a U.S. District Court Judge until his  death in 1997. In addition, he periodically sat  on the U.S. Court of Appeals, 11th Circuit, and  served on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court from 1988 to 1992.  Judge Aronovitz served with distinction and  it is fitting that we honor him today with this  designation.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2913.

RES. 662  Whereas people in the United States are  living longer and the cost of retirement continues to rise, in part because the number of  employers providing retiree health coverage  continues to decline, and retiree health care  costs continue to increase at a rapid pace;  Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement income for the great majority of the people of the United States, but  was never intended by Congress to be the  sole source of retirement income for families;  Whereas recent data from the Employee  Benefit Research Institute indicates that, in  the United States, less than 2⁄3of workers or  their spouses are currently saving for retirement and that the actual amount of retirement savings of workers lags far behind the  amount that will be needed to adequately  fund their retirement years;  Whereas saving for one’s retirement is a  key component to overall financial health  and security during retirement years;  Whereas many workers may not be aware  of their options for saving for retirement or  may not have focused on the importance of,  and need for, saving for their own retirement;  Whereas many employees have available to  them through their employers access to defined benefit and defined contribution plans  to assist them in preparing for retirement,  yet many of them may not be taking advantage of employer-sponsored defined contribution plans at all or to the full extent allowed  by the plans as prescribed by Federal law;  Whereas many workers who are saving for  retirement in tax-preferred vehicles have experienced declines in their account values as  a result of the recent economic downturn  and market decline, making continued contributions all the more important;  Whereas all workers, including public- and  private-sector employees, employees of tax-  exempt organizations, and self-employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of the need to develop personal budgets  and financial plans including retirement savings strategies, and to take advantage of the  availability of tax-preferred savings vehicles  to assist them in saving for retirement; and  Whereas October 18 through October 24,  2009, has been designated as ‘‘National Save  for Retirement Week’’: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National Save for Retirement Week’’, including  raising public awareness of the various tax-  preferred retirement vehicles as important  tools for personal savings and retirement financial security;  (2) supports the need to raise public awareness of efficiently utilizing substantial tax  revenues that currently subsidize retirement  savings, revenues estimated to be in excess  for  the  2008  fiscal year  of  $120,400,000,000  budget;  (3) supports the need to raise public awareness of the importance of saving adequately  for retirement, and the availability of tax-  preferred  employer-sponsored  retirement  savings vehicles; and  (4) calls on the States, localities, schools,  universities, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the people of the  United States to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities with the  goal of increasing retirement savings for all  the people of the United States.

1336,44,2009-07-31,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. PRICE) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2009
1337,44,2009-07-31,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  before I came to Congress I spent 20-  plus years as a physician taking care of  folks in the north Atlanta area, so this  whole debate about the health care  bill, there are many aspects of it that  give me great concern. And the fact of  the matter is, Mr. Speaker, there are  many aspects of it that give the Nation  great concern.  So whether it’s the government-run  program or the takeover of health care  or whether it’s the potential for huge  mandates  from  the Federal Government, many aspects point to areas of  different concern for the American people. And one of them is the issue of rationing, the issue of whether or not the  Federal Government should be deciding  to what extent which Americans receive medical care.  So earlier this year when there was a  proposal that was passed in this House  and in the Senate signed by the President  for something called the Comparative Effectiveness Research Council, fancy name for a potential rationing board, many people voiced concerns  about that, as did I.  And what we heard from the other  side of the aisle, the majority party,  the Democrats, they said, Don’t worry  about that. There will be congressional  oversight. Congress will be able to hold  their feet to the fire. Well, Mr. Speaker, what’s now come out is that may  not be the case.  The  IMAC program, or  the  Independent Medicare Advisory Council, is  a proposal that is being added to the  current health care bill that would create  a new Presidentially  appointed  board  empowered  to  make  recommendations on  cost  savings proposals. These are very, very personal  medical decisions that we’re talking  about here, and cost savings proposals  oftentimes means rationing.  This proposal in the health care bill  right now would eliminate all congressional oversight of the Medicare program and put it in the hands of, you  guessed it, the White House and the  President. It creates a new executive  branch agency with unelected board  members appointed by the President to  make recommendations on the reductions in Medicare payment levels, reimbursement for providers, potentially  refusing to pay for services or care prescribed by doctors as they are deemed  not to be ‘‘cost efficient.’’ That’s the  language, Mr. Speaker.  The bill says that the reforms must  ‘‘either improve the quality of medical  care received by the beneficiaries of  the Medicare program or,’’ not and,  ‘‘improve the efficiency of the Medicare program’s operation.’’  Mr. Speaker, this is extremely concerning. This Congress has created the  Comparative Effectiveness Resources  Board that will have the power to ration care based on cost or quality. It  would make the board’s recommendations binding in the absence of action  by Congress within 30 days if the President approved the recommendation.  Now, many Members of Congress are  concerned  about  payment  rates  in  rural parts of the country, yet this  board eliminates State and community  input  into the Medicare program by  rendering  irrelevant the  influence of  local Medicare Carrier Advisory Communities, or MCACs, to develop and  implement policies expressly applicable to their patient population.  Further, it would reduce the availability of patient advocacy groups to  implement new policies that would improve the health care of our Nation’s  seniors.  The real concern as a physician is  that nonmedical people will be making  medical decisions. It’s a terrible idea.  It’s not what  the American people  want, and they are actually waking up  to the proposal that’s before Congress  right now. And that’s why you see the  numbers of support across this land decreasing.  Let’s move in a positive direction.  There is a positive direction, and that  is to allow quality decisions, medical  decisions to be made between patients  and their families and caring and compassionate physicians.  It’s a  simple  way to do it, not put it in the hands of  a bureaucrat, not put it in the hands of  the White House, not put  it  in the  hands of the President. Let patients  and doctors decide.  Mr. Speaker, that’s the right way.  Mr. Speaker, that’s the American way.

1338,51,2009-07-31,Mr. NUNES.," If the gentleman will  yield for another point of clarification,  you  referred  several  times  to  this  unelected task  force, auto dealer or  auto company task force. And we have  seen these czars that have been appointed by the President. We have 30-  some or 40-some czars, I don’t know.  Every day we add a new czar.  Is  there a difference between  the  czars and the automotive task force?  Was there a czar of the auto task force?  ",2009
1339,51,2009-07-31,Mr. LATOURETTE.," There was a czar.  The President of the United States appointed the auto czar, the head of the  task force. He has recently gone back  into private business. It is now headed  by a fellow by the name of Ron Bloom,  whom we will get to in just a second.  But, you know, a funny thing happened on the way to the task force too,  because when they began making these  decisions, people began to say, Well,  who are these folks and what is their  background? Were they in the manufacturing  business? Did  they make  cars? Did they sell cars? Did they manufacture parts for cars? And The Wall  Street Journal actually did a study of  the members of the task  force and  found that most of them don’t even  own cars, and those that do own cars  own foreign cars, the majority of them.  ",2009
1340,51,2009-07-31,Mr. NUNES., How many people were  on the task force?  ,2009
1341,51,2009-07-31,Mr. LATOURETTE.," I think it was 12  or 16. And then we also had one of our  colleagues from Ohio, Mr. JORDAN, who  serves on  the Judiciary Committee,  and the Judiciary Committee had a  hearing with a panel that asked that  question, How many people on the task  force have any experience at all in the  car industry? And the answer was none.  Nobody. But despite that  fact, they  have made decisions.  Now, the second decision I want to  talk about is the decision that they  made that somehow we needed to close  car dealerships all across America, and  in Chrysler’s case it was 789 and General Motors it is about 2,600.  According to the National Association of Automobile Dealers, about 60  people work at each dealership. So if  you multiply that by the number of  dealerships  that were  instructed  to  close, you are north of 200,000 people;  200,000  people. And  let’s  get  this  straight about car dealers. Most of  them own their own buildings, they do  their own finance plan, floor plan, they  do their own advertising.  The cost to the automobile company  is pretty minimal. But, again, this nonelected task force that doesn’t know  anything about the car industry said,  You know what? Toyota sells an awful  lot of cars in this country and they  don’t have as many car dealers as  Chrysler or General Motors, so therefore the car dealers must be the problem. They are the ones that are creating this problem.  So they basically gave—we had a car  dealer from Michigan, I think it was,  just at Chrysler’s direction, was told to  put  $7 million  into his building  to  make it attractive and all this other  stuff. He didn’t get paid for that. He  got a letter saying, You are no longer  a Chrysler dealer.  The car dealers basically came to  town, and there were pretty amazing  stories about some of these car dealers  and the way they were treated.  b1545  But, you know, it’s not just the 3,000  men and women that own these auto  dealerships, it’s the 200,000 people, the  mechanics, the salespeople, the clerks,  they’re out of a job. So I don’t know  how you recover the economy by having less stores.  ",2009
1342,51,2009-07-31,Mr. NUNES.," If the gentleman would  yield, one of the important points here  that you’ve made  is that this task  force, this unelected task force that  has no experience in running anything  to do with cars—in fact, some of them  don’t even own cars—have now made  this unilateral decision to close these  dealerships, and  the way  that  they  were able to do that is because the government has now taken over ownership  of the car companies.  ",2009
1343,51,2009-07-31,Mr. LATOURETTE.," The gentleman is  absolutely right.  I will tell you that initially the auto  task force ran from this dealer issue  like a scalded cat, and they were really  quick to put out a press release saying,  We’re not micromanaging the car companies. We don’t know enough to run  Chrysler and General Motors. This was  the car companies. This was General  Motors, and this was Chrysler. They  made the decision. They are the bad  ones who decided they were going to  throw all of these people out of work.  A couple of things run counter to  that. The first was, just like I think  it’s an interesting business model that  you are going to sell more cars with  less dealers, the auto task force in the  Chrysler bankruptcy, according to an  article in the Automotive News, didn’t  want Chrysler to advertise their cars  during the pendency of the bankruptcy.  When somebody, apparently, told them  how stupid that was, they said, Okay,  you can spend half of it. It was $134  million. So, again, this unelected task  force apparently thinks that you can  sell more cars if you don’t advertise  and if you have 3,000 less stores across  the country.  The other thing that sort of gets in  their way is Fritz Henderson, who is  the president and the CEO of General  Motors, old and new, gave an affidavit  to the bankruptcy court in New York.  I would like to insert that into the  RECORDas well.  UNITEDSTATESBANKRUPTCYCOURTSOUTHERNDISTRICTOFNEWYORK, INREGENERAL  MOTORSCORP., ETAL., DEBTORS  AFFIDAVITOFFREDERICKA. HENDERSON,  PURSUANTTOLOCALBANKRUPTCYRULE1007–2  State of New York, County of New York  Frederick A. Henderson, being duly sworn,  hereby deposes and says:  1. I am the President, Chief Executive Officer, and a Director of General Motors Corporation, a Delaware corporation  (‘‘GM’’),  which together with its wholly-owned direct  subsidiaries, Chevrolet-Saturn  of Harlem,  Inc.  (‘‘Chevrolet-Saturn’’) and Saturn, LLC  (‘‘Saturn’’), and GM’s wholly-owned indirect  subsidiary Saturn Distribution Corporation  (‘‘Saturn Distribution’’), are the debtors in the  above-captioned  chapter  11  cases  (collectively, the ‘‘Debtors’’). I submit this affidavit  (the ‘‘Affidavit’’) pursuant to Rule 1007–2 of  the Local Bankruptcy Rules for the Southern District of New York (the ‘‘Local Rules’’)  to assist the Court and other parties in interest in understanding the circumstances that  compelled the commencement of these chapter 11 cases and in support of (i) the Debtors’  petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title  11, United States Code  (the  ‘‘Bankruptcy  Code’’); filed on the date hereof (the ‘‘Commencement Date’’), (ii) the relief requested in  the motions and applications that the Debtors have filed with the Court, including, but  not limited to, the ‘‘first day motions,’’ and  *  *  *  *  *  93. The Company, however, is not assuming  and assigning to New GM all of its existing  dealer franchise agreements. The Company’s  vast dealer network, consisting of approximately 6,000 dealerships, developed over an  extended time period  in which the Company’s market share was growing and was far  greater than it is now, and when there was  far less, or even no meaningful foreign competition. Consequently, and precisely because there are now  far more dealerships  than the Company’s market share can support, including, in some cases, multiple dealers in a single contracting community and  dealerships that have become poorly situated  as a result of changing demographics, the  Purchaser is not willing to continue all dealerships. Among  the dealerships  the Purchaser is not willing to continue, for example, are those approximately 400 dealers who  sell fewer than fifty cars per year, and those  approximately  250 dealers who  sell  fewer  than 100 cars per year. Approximately 630  other dealerships are not being continued because they are dealers who, in whole or substantial part, sell brands that are being discontinued.  94. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 363  Transaction does not contemplate an abrupt  cutoff of nonretained dealerships. In pursuit  of the maximization of New GM’s ability to,  among other things, maintain consumer confidence and goodwill, provide ongoing warranty and other services, and preserve resale  and trade-in values, the Company not only is  giving approximately 17 months notice, but  also will offer to enter into, and New GM will  assume ‘‘deferred termination agreements’’  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:05 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H31JY9.REC H31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

1345,58,2009-07-31,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege to be recognized  here on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives. And having  had an opportunity to listen to some of  the dialogue that went on previously,  I’m glad that I have a chance to raise  these issues.  On the front of everybody’s mind in  this country  is the situation of our  health care and our health insurance  for 306 million people  in the United  States. And I would point out that if  we look at the size of this economy and  the size of this population, it is a huge  endeavor to think that we would take  17.5 percent of the American economy,  17.5 percent of our gross domestic product and switch it over to a government-run plan, and do so in almost the  blink of a legislative eye, and do so  without the  full deliberation of the  floor of the House of Representatives  or without the American people having  an opportunity to weigh in.  I am glad that this process has been  slowed down—however great the price  has been—so that there is an opportunity now for some of the legislation  that has been more closely refined,  shall we say, in its 1,100 or so-page  form to be available to the public, a  public that has more access to this information that is going on in the House  than ever before because of being able  to access this information now by the  Internet. And all of us in this Congress  have Web sites, and I would think there  is at least one link on every Member of  Congress’ Web site that will help you  access this information on where we  are with bills that are being deliberated here in this Congress.  And as I look at where we are today  and what’s out there, I’m very interested in the entire month of August  and I’m very  interested  in the  first  week  of September. Those  are  the  times when the American people will  have had a chance to read the bill, talk  to the people within their profession or  whatever their interest group is that  have read the bill, weigh their ideas, do  this across the backyard fence and do  this at the coffee table at work, and be  able to give us the benefit of the wisdom of the American people to weigh  in on all the components that have  been created here that are promised to  come at us and perhaps have a vote on  a  final passage; not here, not any  longer this week or next week or in the  month of August, but perhaps in the  first or second week in September, and  something that—this will decide the  fate, if it’s passed, of the health care  system of the United States, I believe,  at least as far as we can look into the  future. And it is a national health care  plan.  It  is a government-run health  care plan. It is a model that transforms  the entire health care system in the  United States.  Today we have more than 1,300 private health insurance companies competing for premium dollars, And they  do so by providing the best value for  the dollar and marketing  that best  value for the dollar and trying to adjust those policies to meet the demands  of the American people. Over 1,300 private health insurance companies, and  among them they offer, in the aggregate, perhaps as many as 100,000 different health insurance options. And  the President of the United States has  said he just wants to offer one more option, 100,001 policies now for everybody  in America to choose from if this bill  should pass.  And this extra government option  that he would offer, as if there wasn’t  enough competition out there among  the 1,300 health insurance companies  and the roughly 100,000 policies that  are there, how can anyone presume  that one more policy that would just  compete with the other policies out  there would result in anything other  than one one-hundredth more options  for the people of the United States?  I would submit that there is a lot  more afoot here, Mr. Speaker, there is  a lot more afoot here. The people that  are advocating for this public option,  the people that are advocating that the  Federal Government should run their  own health insurance policy in order to  compete against the private sector are  the people who sometimes they will  leak it into the media, sometimes they  will shout it out in a private meeting,  but in their soul they want a single-  payer, government-run, socialized medicine, one-option government plan for  everybody. And they want to run every  private health insurance company out  of business and take the 100,000 options  that the American people have with  them. That is their agenda.  And I can put together a string of  quotes from the very liberal Members  of this Congress that find themselves  in powerful positions in this Congress,  gavels in hand, that are determined to  take away the private health insurance  options and turn it into one government plan.  Even  the President of  the United  States believes in that, however much  lip service he has paid to the idea of  telling the American people, well, if  you  like your health  insurance that  you have today, then you get to keep  it. That’s one thing that I cannot accept that the President believes when  he says it. He is a very smart man. He’s  got to understand that if it says in the  bill—and  it does, section 102 of the  bill—that every private health insurance policy has to be rewritten in the  first 5 years of the passage of the legislation that’s proposed, that means the  American people’s  individual policies  will all change within 5 years and they  will have to accommodate themselves  to the new qualifications that will be  written by a health insurance czar to  be appointed by the President later,  and regulations that are not in the bill,  but regulations that would grant that  health insurance czar the power and  the authority to set the standard.  So he might rule that every health  insurance policy in America has to pay  for abortion. He might rule that everyone has to pay for mental health. He  might rule that everyone has to pay for  all pharmaceuticals, or maybe only generic pharmaceuticals.  b1700  Whatever he may decide, he’ll be  looking at the costs of the premium,  the percentages of copayments, and the  regulations will be written so that the  public option, which is so carefully defined and that language that’s determined to be defended by the Democrats  in this Congress—so that the public option can compete with all of these 1,300  private  health  insurance  companies  that have competed in the marketplace  for years and found their niche in the  market and done it the American way.  Now, if somebody thinks that there’s  too much money in the health insurance business, why don’t they get in  that business and provide that health  insurance and lower the premiums and  cut down on the administrative overhead and take some money and take  some profit out of it?  That’s how this works  in the  free  market system. If there’s something  out there in the marketplace that has  too much profit in it, you don’t need  government to come in and do it for  you. You need to take a look and determine is it a monopoly? If it’s a monopoly, then Teddy Roosevelt rides again.  Let’s bring him in and let’s bust the  trust.

1356,79,2009-07-31,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President,  while we are waiting on Members to  come and present their amendments, I  want to talk about something associated with agriculture in my State. It is  an issue that will probably come up  after the August break, and that is energy legislation. Energy, in our State,  is inextricably linked to agriculture,  where it is a big energy-using industry  but also one that derives a lot of income for agriculture.  The  industry  itself moved  from a  food and fiber industry to a food, fiber,  and fuels industry, with ethanol and  biodiesel and increasingly—this is a bit  of a sidebar but a connection—wind energy. Wind energy,  in many of the  rural areas of our State, is providing  income to those regions.  I want to talk about the energy policy of this country, particularly as it is  associated with agriculture. We need to  look at the agricultural industry and  what it can produce for a domestic fuel  need. I am hopeful we can, over time,  up the ethanol standard from 10 percent to a higher mixed blend. I would  like to see us get to 15, 20 percent in  the current vehicle fleet. I think this is  doable and the technology is there and  it is not harmful to anybody or any of  the automobiles in the automobile industry.  A number of us signed a letter asking  that fuel blend be upped and also that  the refineries be held harmless in any  up mixture of blending that might be  considered. A number of refineries are  sensitive about  the MTBE problem,  when they were pushed by Congress to  put in MTBE, and later were held responsible  for  difficulties  associated  with that. I think we ought to hold the  refinery industry harmless but allow  the mixture to go up from 10 percent.  In my State, a number of ethanol  plants have been built. They are cost  effective and they continue to operate  well. It is a dual-commodity business,  where we are  looking at  the commodity price of oil and the commodity  price of corn. We can do very well financially, but if they move against us,  we can do poorly. We have the capacity  to move the blend up to the 15 or 20  percent level.  It is my hope that down the road that  will be  something of  consideration.  That has been a big piece of the agricultural policy in this country—something that has been supported in the  Agriculture appropriations bill, to increase research on ethanol and make  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:32 Aug 05, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S31JY9.REC S31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009

1360,86,2009-07-31,The PRESIDING OFFICER., That is  correct.  f  SMALL BUSINESS/SBIR  ,2009
1361,86,2009-07-31,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I applaud the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee for their efforts in  putting  together  a  thoughtful,  balanced  reauthorization of  the Small  Business  Innovations  Research—  SBIR—and Small Business Technology  Transfer—STTR—programs.  I know the committee is in negotiations with the House trying to reach a  good reconciliation with the right parameters. I hope they do, so that we  have these programs in place for years  to come instead of another short-term  extension.  SBIR was set up in 1982 and requires  11 Federal departments and agencies  like the Department of Defense, the  National Institutes of Health and the  National Science Foundation  to  set  aside 2.5 percent of their research and  development budgets  for small businesses, which  is over $2 billion per  year. STTR sets aside another 0.3 percent of R&D for small businesses to  work  in partnership with university  and  institutional  researchers.  Both  programs have been highly successful,  helping propel small business growth,  and develop and commercialize the innovations that are the backbone of our  economy.  I wanted to share a few facts about  small business for the record.  According to the Small Business Administration,  small businesses annually create between 60 and 80 percent of  the net new jobs in America.  Small businesses produce on average  13 to 14 times more patents per employee than large patenting firms.  Small business employs about 38 percent of the scientists and engineers in  America, up  from only 6 percent  in  1978.  Despite all this growth and stellar  track record, small business receives  only about 4 percent of Federal extramural research dollars. That needs to  change. Small business has proven they  can do Federal R&D as well as or better than large business, and they deserve more space at the table.  Small business is going to be the engine that pulls the country out of this  recession, like it has so many times in  the past. Looking beyond the recession, small business will again develop  the innovative technologies in which  America consistently leads the world.  The Senate bill wisely supports and extends our support for small business’s  role  in growing a vibrant national  economy.  In my own State of North Dakota,  SBIR has helped fund a number of innovations, and I wanted to mention a  few of them.  The Technology Applications Group  of Grand Forks,  located  in the Red  River Valley Research Corridor,  invented  the Tagnite  coating  system  through Army and Navy SBIR funds.  The technology allows the military to  coat magnesium alloys for parts, ships,  helicopters and airplanes in a way that  is much less toxic than old processes,  cuts down on corrosion, and saves on  maintenance.  Agsco of Grand Forks received an  SBIR grant that led to development of  the SCOIL and SUN-IT II products that  enhance crop herbicide effectiveness.  Agsco turned their SBIR grants into  two products with a great deal of commercial impact.  Dakota Technologies of Fargo has received multiple SBIR grants, including  two that led to development of BEAM,  or ballast exchange assurance meter,  which measures ballast water in ships  to make sure they don’t contain harmful species or contaminants. BEAM is  currently in a pilot program with the  Coast Guard.  Back in 2002, I secured funding to develop telepharmacy technology to connect  pharmacists  directly with  patients and pharmacy technicians regardless of their location. Technologies  like this have been a boon to rural  communities because they allow them  to compete on a  level playing  field  with urban areas.  The USDA  just awarded Telepharmacy Concepts of Dickinson, ND, with  an $80,000 Phase I SBIR award that will  allow them to research whether telepharmacy technology could be used for  medication  therapy  management,  which is a way to provide patient education, increase medication compliance  and improve health care outcomes.  Praxis  Strategy Group  of Grand  Forks has received SBIR awards nine  times, including grants from the USDA  to develop strategic processes like the  High Performance Community Initiative and the Enterprise Homesteading  Program that help communities, especially small communities, attract entrepreneurs, develop dynamic economies, and market themselves.  While I am happy with the Senate reauthorization, I am concerned about  some of the provisions in the House  version we are trying to reconcile it  with.  First, the House bill opens participation in SBIR to companies that are majority-owned by venture capital firms.  I have nothing against venture capital  companies, but the small businesses  that they own have already shown they  can successfully attract capital in the  private market.  SBIR was  intended  to help  small  businesses without  the  connections  available to do that. I think the House  bill  is trying to  fix something that  isn’t broken.  Second, given the long-term success  of SBIR and STTR, I think  it only  makes sense to increase the share of  agency funds set aside for small business as  the Senate’s bill gradually  does.  American business has changed dramatically  since SBIR was  created.  Since 1978, the share of scientists and  engineers working for small businesses  has, as I said, increased from 6 to 38  percent. Funding for SBIR and STTR  needs to increase to reflect that reality. I am concerned that the House  bill keeps their allocations where they  have been for 27 years, despite the successful track record of the programs.  Given the figures I have quoted previously, increasing the set-aside from  2.5 to 3.5 percent is the very least we  should do.  Small business  is the core of our  country’s economy, and we have here a  program that has a strong track record  of encouraging growth and innovation  in that area. I urge the program’s reauthorization with the principles of Senate bill S. 1233.  f  JOHNSON ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VETERANS  HOMELESSNESS ACT  ",2009
1362,86,2009-07-31,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I wish to  speak on the introduction of S. 1547—  the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act. I am very proud to be an  original cosponsor of this legislation  and to join my good friend, Senator  JACKREED, along with Senators TIM  and PATTYMURRAY, on addressing the tragedy of homelessness  among our Nation’s veterans. My three  colleagues have been steadfast in their  resolve to address the needs of veterans, including the tragedy of homelessness, and I commend them.  Senator REEDhas been a strong and  committed leader on affordable housing and homeless issues and his leadership played a strong role in the recent  enactment of  the historic Homeless  Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act or HEARTH Act.  I am honored to join him again.  Like the HEARTH Act, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act  builds on our work over the past several years by focusing on the importance of permanent supportive housing.  Further, it takes important steps to  break down the barriers between the  Departments of Veterans Affairs, VA,  and Housing and Urban Development,  HUD, to ensure that veterans receive  the quality services and housing they  deserve and need.  The most notable element of the legislation is the authorization of HUD–  VA Supportive Housing or HUD–VASH  rental-assistance  vouchers. Working  with  Senator PATTY new  HUD–VASH vouchers have been funded  over the past 2 years. While other HUD  homeless-assistance  programs  serve  veterans, HUD–VASH is the only permanent housing program that is specifically targeted to veterans and tied  to veteran-specific supportive services  from the VA.  We have been fortunate to fund 10,000  new vouchers each year but with over  MURRAY,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:32 Aug 05, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S31JY9.REC S31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 6 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2009
1363,100,2009-07-31,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, the use  of massive amounts of human antibiotics for  non-therapeutic purposes  in  industrial  food  animal production is seriously jeopardizing the  health of Americans. This practice is contributing  to  the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, often rendering  ineffective human life-savings drugs.  I am submitting for the record a letter to the  White House, signed by twenty reputable organizations such as  the  Infectious Diseases  Society of America, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and  Pew Charitable Trusts, which supports  the  Food and Drug Administration’s early steps to  phase out the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and  feed efficiency  in  food animals,  and calls on the Administration to go further.  JULY24, 2009.  Ms. MELODYBARNES,  Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy,  The White House, Washington, DC.  DEARMS. BARNES: As organizations committed to protecting patients, public health,  animal health, and food safety, the undersigned groups are writing to express our  grave concern about  the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture and our strong support  for the Administration’s new ‘‘public health  approach to antimicrobial use in animals,’’  which was articulated by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) in its July 13th statement before the Rules Committee of the U.S.  House of Representatives. The Obama Administration’s  leadership  in  providing  a  clear path forward on this highly politically  charged issue is very much welcomed after  decades of inertia.  Our combined memberships  include  the  country’s foremost scientific and medical experts and represent more than eleven million  concerned Americans  and  health  professionals. Our position is based on objective  health interests and concerns that dangerous  drug resistant infections are rapidly increasing in hospitals and community settings adding  to  the economic burden of  the U.S.  healthcare costs.  Specifically, we support the FDA’s calls for  phasing out the use of antimicrobial drugs  for growth promotion and  feed efficiency,  and for requiring that all other uses of these  drugs be carried out under the supervision of  a veterinarian and within the boundaries of  a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship—which we expect will end over-the-  counter sales of tons of antimicrobial drugs  annually. We also support the agency’s expressed intent to clearly define the limited  instances where antimicrobials may be used  judiciously in food animals for purposes of  disease prevention and control and are eager  to work with FDA to ensure that the policy  developed is the most protective of public  health. We also urge the agency to make the  new antimicrobial policy mandatory, retroactive to already-approved drugs, and enforceable, in order to best guarantee a significant reduction in antimicrobial use. The  Administration’s  statement  clearly  demonstrates  a  commitment  to  sound  and  science-based policies that are backed up by  scores of scientific and medical publications  and will protect the health of every American.  The development of antimicrobial agents  to treat life-threatening infections has been  one of the most notable medical achievements  of  the  past  century. Physicians,  healthcare professionals, and public health  and food safety advocates are greatly concerned about the growing body of scientific  evidence demonstrating that antimicrobial  drug use in livestock and poultry contributes  to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria to  people. Drug-resistant organisms are plaguing Americans, including otherwise healthy  individuals, in healthcare settings and communities across the country. We are pleased  that these concerns finally are being recognized and addressed by the federal government to forestall epidemics of untreatable  infections.  Fundamental to FDA’s new approach—and  our support for it—are the principles that:  ‘‘protecting public health requires the judicious use  in animal agriculture of those  antimicrobials of importance in human medicine’’ and that ‘‘purposes other than for the  advancement of animal and human health  should not be considered judicious use.’’—Dr.  Joshua Sharfstein, FDA’s Principal Deputy  Commissioner, July 13, 2009.  The Administration’s vision to eliminate  non-judicious uses of antimicrobial drugs,  including for purposes of growth promotion  and feed efficiency and non-judicious disease  prevention which have been practiced in animal agriculture  for several decades, demonstrates a critical public policy shift that  will better protect the public against resistant infections and preserve the power of existing antibiotics. In addition, we urge FDA  to formalize its position on veterinary supervision of all antimicrobial uses and ending  the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics for  animal agricultural uses, which are  long-  overdue. The sale of antimicrobials for use in  human medicine  requires  a  prescription;  there is no reason to permit a lower standard  for agricultural purposes where considerably  more antimicrobial drugs are used annually.  The Administration’s new policy direction  appears intended to reflect the concerns of a  broad consensus of the scientific, medical,  public health and international health communities. Such consensus is buttressed by  the actions of expert bodies and governments. For example:  Since 2002, the World Health Organization  (WHO) has called upon all nations to shift  from use of antimicrobials  in non-human  medicine.  In 2003, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of  the National Academies of Science called on  the FDA to ban the use of antimicrobials for  growth promotion in animals, if those drugs  were also used in human medicine.  In 2006, the European Union banned non-  therapeutic use of antimicrobials, because  such use was found to raise food safety concerns, and the ban was instituted to protect  against  further  development  of  antimicrobial resistance.  We  recognize  that  phasing  out  of  antimicrobials for non-judicious uses in animals will require changes in the agricultural  industry. But  protection  of  the  public’s  health must come first, and the phase out  can be conducted in a way that that minimizes  costs  to  the agriculture  industry.  Farmers in Europe have adapted to such a  policy without undue disruption of production or increased consumer costs; the United  States can learn from that experience while  also protecting American lives. In addition,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture has recognized  that various production methods  used in the United States today are viable  alternatives to non judicious antimicrobial  uses and  such alternatives are employed  with little negative—or even with somewhat  positive—economic impact to producers.  We urge you to maintain the scientifically  sound positions the Administration already  has taken in support of phasing out growth  promotion and feed efficiency uses, and to finalize a policy that will strictly manage a  narrow set of prophylactic uses while mandating veterinary-patient relationships and  eliminating  the  over-the-counter  sale  of  antibiotics for use in animals.  We remain committed to working with the  Administration to implement these new approaches in ways that will best protect the  lives and health of both humans and animals.

1367,114,2009-07-31,Mr. WOLF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the Women Airforce Service Pilots  (WASP) of World War II. They were the first  women  to  fly military aircraft  for  the United  States and deserve to be commended for their  bravery.  From 1942 to 1944, these women flew in  various non-combat missions, allowing male  pilots to be deployed into combat. Their success in flying fighter, bomber, transport, and  training aircraft eventually led to the integration of  female pilots  into  the United States  Armed Services.  There were 1,102  female WASP  trained  during World War II, and 300 survive today,  two of whom currently reside in Virginia’s 10th  Congressional  District.  Joan  Lemley  of  Purcellville and Barbara Ross of Warrenton  are two of these brave pilots who served their  country during World War II.  On July 1, President Obama signed S. 164  into  law, which awards our nation’s highest  honor—the  Congressional Gold Medal—to  each of these women pioneers of World War  II. They will finally receive the recognition they  deserve  for  their wartime military service  to  our country. I was pleased to be an original  cosponsor of the House version of this measure, which was introduced by Congresswoman  ILEANAROS-LEHTINEN.  I ask that my colleagues join me today in  commending Barbara Ross, Joan Lemley and  the other women pilots for serving their country in World War II.  f  TRIBUTE TO RYAN NOVAK  HON.

1369,114,2009-07-31,Mr. SIMPSON.," Madam Speaker, in accordance with the policies and standards put forth  by the House Appropriations Committee and  the GOP Leadership, I would like to list the  congressionally-directed projects  I have  requested in my home State of Idaho that are  contained  in  the  report of H.R. 3326,  the  FY2010 House Defense Appropriations Bill.  Project Name:  3–D Technology  for Advanced Sensor Systems  Amount Received: $2,000,000  Account: Electronics Technology Account in  the Department of Defense RDT&E  Recipient: Boise State University  Recipient’s Street Address: 1910 University  Drive, Boise, Idaho 83725  Description: The 3–D packaging approach  offers the promise of a dramatic decrease in  the system weight and volume, together with  increased system performance. This project  will provide funding to continue to develop 3–  D processing techniques on silicon and LTCC  platforms. These include technologies for die-  and wafer-scale bonding and 3–D  interconnects. These techniques will be applied to create 3–D  integration and packaging solutions  applicable to a general category of high performance sensor systems. The military has a  need  for new  three-dimensional (3–D) packaging of electronic systems, particularly sensor  systems for portable (i.e., on-soldier) applications. 3–D integration and packaging of sensors will result in smaller electronics with expanded capability, allowing the soldier in the  field to be more effective.  Project Name: Accelerator-Driven Non-Destructive Testing  Amount Received: $2,000,000  Account: Support Systems Development Account in the Air Force RDT&E  Recipient: Idaho State University  Recipient’s Street Address: 921 South 8th  Avenue, Stop 8007, Pocatello, Idaho 83209  Description: The  Idaho Accelerator Center  (IAC) will develop a research, education and  commercialization program that takes non-destructive testing techniques developed at the  IAC and advances  their development. The  penetrating  and  non-destructive  techniques  that are under development include new techniques  in positron annihilation spectroscopy  with accelerator-based gammabeams, the use  of mono-chromatic x-ray beams and the use  of photon activation  (via photonuclear  reactions) for trace element analysis of materials  and manufacturing processes. The development of practical non-destructive testing (NDT)  techniques will help the U.S. Air Force reduce  aircraft downtime necessary for inspection and  enhance  turn-around  times by more quickly  identifying needed  repairs  through spectroscopy and the use of x-ray. The development  of practical NDT  techniques will be of  immense value to the armed forces in four critical areas: quicker return of aircraft to the line  by reducing the tear-downs necessary for inspection;  non-destructively  addressing  the  enormous ‘aging fleet’ problem of the U.S.A.F.  and the private sector; better economics by replacing parts on an on condition inspections  basis instead of a ‘life limited’ basis; and the  ability to successfully apply NDT techniques to  composite materials. Currently, no commercialized NDT  technique works on composite  materials.  Project Name: Domestic Manufacturing of  45nm Electronics (DOME)  Amount Received: $2,000,000  Account: Advanced Spacecraft Technology  Account in the Air Force RDT&E  Recipient: American Semiconductor, Inc.  Recipient’s Street Address:  3100 South  Vista Avenue, Suite 230, Boise, Idaho 83705  Description: Funding  for  this program will  deploy a new foundry capability to address the  most critical electronics sourcing issue faced  for secure supply of advanced DOD integrated  circuits  in 2012 and beyond. DOME  is an  AFRL-sponsored  initiative  to  implement  a  45nm state-of-the-art wafer  fabrication capability  to meet current and  future system requirements for fabrication of specialized integrated circuits in a broadly available foundry  capacity to serve DOD. Microelectronics capability  for defense applications  requires advancement of technology for each generation  of new defense system.

1370,121,2009-07-31,Ms. KILROY.," Madam Speaker, today I introduce legislation, the ‘‘Medical Debt Relief Act  of 2009,’’ which would protect  those hard-  working Americans who play by the rules, pay  or settle their medical debts, yet find their economic well-being and  their credit scores adversely affected for years due to medical debt,  large or small, that has gone to collection.  The  ‘‘Medical Debt Relief Act of 2009’’  would prohibit all consumer credit agencies  and creditors  from using paid off or settled  medical debt collection  in assessing a consumer’s creditworthiness.  Medical debt  is unique. Americans don’t  choose when accidents happen or when  illness strikes. Medical debt collection issues affect both insured and uninsured.  According to credit evaluators, medical debt  collections are more likely to be in dispute, inconsistently  reported,  and  of  questionable  value  in predicting  future payment performance because it is atypical and non-predictive.  Nevertheless, medical debt  that has been  completely paid off or settled can significantly  damage a consumer’s credit score for years.  As a result, consumers can be denied credit  or pay higher  interest  rates when buying a  home or obtaining a credit card.  The issue of medical debt affects millions. In  fact, according  to  the Commonwealth Fund,  medical bill problems or accrued medical debt  affects roughly 72 million working-age adults  in American. For 2007, 28 million working-age  American adults were contacted by a collection agency for unpaid medical bills.  f  RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF ROUND  ROCK, TX  HON. JOHN R.

1373,128,2009-07-31,Mr. BOUCHER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor a southwest Virginia resident  whose service to this Nation will long be remembered. On June 17, 2009, Darrell ‘‘Shifty’’  Powers, a distinguished World War II veteran,  passed away. I would like to take this occasion  to  recognize  his many  contributions  through his military service to our great Nation. Mr. Powers, who was portrayed  in  the  HBO documentary film ‘‘Band of Brothers,’’ is  a true American hero from southwest Virginia.  A native of the Dickenson County, Town of  Clinchco, Virginia, Mr. Powers volunteered for  the United States Army  during  the  early  stages of the Second World War in 1942. He  was quickly assigned  to  the newly  formed  506th Parachute Infantry Regiment and began  training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. Each day,  the new recruits would train by running 6 miles  up and down the Curahee Mountain. As a result of the steadfast dedication of Mr. Powers  and the other members of what came to be  known as Easy Company, the regiment was  quickly  transformed  into one of  the Army’s  toughest fighting units.  In  1943,  after  completion  of  parachute  school at Ft. Benning, Georgia, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry was attached to the 101st Airborne Division and was  transferred  to England, where  they would  spend a year preparing  to  invade  the European continent.  At about 1 a.m. on June 6, 1944, Mr. Powers and the other members of Easy Company  boarded  a  plane which  transported  them  across the English Channel in order to parachute into Normandy behind German fortified  positions. Shortly after  landing, Mr. Powers  and 2 fellow soldiers realized that they were a  day’s walk from their intended drop zone. The  Airborne troops spent almost a week fighting  German soldiers before they were sent back  to England to prepare for an invasion of Holland.  In September 1944, Mr. Powers’ unit, along  with Polish and English divisions, parachuted  into Holland to secure a road for tanks and  supply shipments to prepare for a push across  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:28 Aug 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.063 E31JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2009

1375,135,2009-07-31,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Madam Chair, I rise today  in support of H.R. 3326 the Fiscal Year 2010  Defense Appropriations Act. This bill makes  important  investments  to keep  the American  people safe, strengthen our military, and support our troops.  This bill contains $636.3 billion for the Department of Defense next year  to provide  funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,  enhance  recruitment, address critical equipment needs at home, and, perhaps most importantly, support our troops and their families  who give so much in defense of our nation. As  a Member of the House Budget Committee, I  am pleased that H.R. 3326 is fiscally responsible, for the first time including funding for ongoing needs for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan in the regular budgeting process. The decision  to hide  funding  for our engagement  abroad in ‘‘emergency’’ spending led to financial mismanagement, and  it ends  this year.  The bill also calls for additional contracting reform and other efficiencies, while ensuring sufficient support for our men and women in uniform.  As a veteran of the U.S. Army, and the representative of Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force  Base, I am proud of our troops who serve our  country so bravely. Whether in the Army, Air  Force or Navy, the Coast Guard, or the Marines; whether in the National Guard or in the  Reserves; each soldier deserves our full support and respect. This bill provides our troops  with a 3.4 percent pay raise and recognizes  the hardship of stop-loss deployment by providing an additional $500 per month for involuntary extensions of active duty.  It provides  significant  funding  for readiness  training and  medical care, often overlooked aspects of our  military support. Knowing that the mission at  home for military families is often critical to the  soldier’s mission abroad,  I am pleased  that  H.R. 3326 fully funds Family Support and Yellow Ribbon programs, as well as providing  $472 million for family advocacy initiatives.  Madam Chair,  there  is no more  important  function  for Congress  than  to protect  the  American people. This bill ensures our troops  in Iraq and Afghanistan have the funding and  equipment they need, provides support for our  troops at home, and  improves  the health of  our entire military. I urge my colleagues to join  me in support of H.R. 3326.  f  HONORING  BRITTANY  LEAP’S  FIGHT  AGAINST  NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION  HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 30, 2009  ",2009
1376,135,2009-07-31,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the bravery and  fortitude of a very special and courageous  constituent of mine, Brittany Leap; and her  mother, Sandy, and  father, Richard.  In February 2006, Brittany was diagnosed with a debilitating  and  degenerative  disorder—  Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation, NBIA.  NBIA is a very rare and devastating neurological disorder  that only gets worse over  time—resulting in constant muscle cramping,  an inability to control one’s body, difficulty with  speech, a loss of peripheral vision, and even  blindness. No cure or specific means of treatment currently exists for NBIA, and scientists  are still baffled by  the  factors  that  influence  the disease.  Imagine waking up one morning having lost  the ability to walk, or talk, or even eat. In Brittany’s case, however, this is no dream. This is  a very real challenge that Brittany faces every  day of her life. To make matters worse, one of  the few laboratories dedicated to researching  her disease  is at risk of having  to close  its  doors because of a lack of funding; doors that  upon closing will forfeit the hope of Brittany,  her family, and the thousands of other people  suffering from NBIA, that a cure may one day  be realized.  Brittany  is determined  to continue  fighting  this disease and  the potentially devastating  consequences of what will happen if the research to develop a cure is suspended. She is  unwavering in her pursuit to raise the funds  necessary to keep hope alive, not only for her,  but for everyone else with NBIA. Brittany has  taken it upon herself, with the help of her loving parents—and so many others across this  great Nation—to raise $250,000 by year’s end  to keep the search for a cure alive.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in wishing Brittany and her family and all  others with NBIA our heartfelt regards for their  efforts to bring an end to this devastating illness, and I ask they give their support in any  way possible to help Brittany in her efforts.

1377,135,2009-07-31,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Chair, I rise in  support of  the 2010 Department of Defense  Appropriations Act. This bill provides $636.3  billion to fund the defense, military family support, humanitarian assistance and oversight  priorities of the American people.  This bill provides  the  resources  to  implement President Obama’s  national  security  strategy, including the new approach he is taking with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan. The  bill also provides funding to support the general quality-of-life needs of our  troops and  their  families. Specifically,  the measure provides a 3.4 percent pay increase for military  personnel; $8.3 million in additional funds to  compensate personnel subject to ‘‘stop loss’’  requirements; and $2.6 billion to support military families—including $472 million for family  advocacy programs  that help children and  families manage the many challenges of military service.  The bill also provides $29.9 billion for the  defense health program, including $500 million  for traumatic brain injury treatments and funds  to treat Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome. And  finally,  the Defense Appropriations Act  includes a number of provisions  to  improve  oversight of defense contractors and $110 million  for  international humanitarian assistance  including foreign disaster and emergency relief  assistance.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

1379,142,2009-07-31,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to a beloved friend of mine and  many in this body, Martha Dodd Buonanno.  Martha Buonanno would best like to be remembered as a mother, grandmother, and  wife. She died after a brief illness on July 6,  2009. Her  five  children, Helena, Bernard,  Carolyn, Jody, and Margaret, and 17 grandchildren  surrounded  their  father  Bernard  Buonanno crying and laughing as they celebrated the life of this remarkable woman.  Her love of family and children led her to  volunteer  for many worthy organizations  in  Rhode  Island. She was a mentor  in Providence public schools with the VIPS program;  she served on the boards of the Providence  Preservation Society and the RI Association of  the Blind. She was proud to chair the research  center at  the University of Connecticut  that  had been named in honor of her father: Thomas J. Dodd.  Martha and I became friends more than 50  years ago at Trinity College  in Washington,  DC. We shared in common that we both came  from political families—in fact, when we first  met, both of our fathers were running for Senate.  But our  friendship grew over many years  because we had so much more in common:  Martha loved to travel, she loved to laugh, and  always, Martha  loved Democratic politics.  In  fact, Martha volunteered on every single one  of her brother, Senator CHRISTOPHERDODD’s,  campaigns. She adored all her siblings: CHRIS,  Tom, Carolyn, Jeremy, Nick.  Martha Dodd Buonanno had a strong connection to this House, where her father and  her brother served. She lived and raised her  family in Providence and was admired by our  colleagues  and  JIM  LANGEVIN, and Senators JACKREEDand SHELroots were  in Connecticut and Congresswoman ROSADELAURO  and  Congressmen  JOE  COURTNEY, and CHRISMURPHY join me in expressing condolences  to  the Buonanno and  Dodd families.  It is a fitting tribute to Martha’s life that more  than 3,000 people attended her wake, lining  the streets for more than seven hours. Her funeral mass was moved from her parish to another simply to be able to accommodate everyone. Those who came to pay their last respects  to Martha  included Vice President  BIDEN, United States Senators, and a Governor; but Martha would have been equally  proud to know that children that she tutored,  neighbors  from her block, and  friends  from  growing up joined that day. As I know well,  when Martha made  a  friend,  she  stayed  friends with them forever.  DONWHITEHOUSE. Her  KENNEDY PATRICK JOHN LARSON,  Although Martha was always a sparkling  personality, she became even more so when  she met Bernie. Their love, and their children  and grandchildren, are her lasting legacy.  I hope it is a consolation to her family that  all of her classmates at Trinity College loved  her for more than 50 years, and will miss her.  I am honored to place in the RECORD the  extraordinary eulogy of her beloved brother,  Senator CHRISDODD, which captures her spirit  and honors her life.  A TRIBUTETOMYFABULOUSSISTERMARTHA  (By Christopher J. Dodd)  Before sharing some brief comments about  my sister Martha, I want to observe that  anything I say will only pale in comparison  to the incredible comments of Martha and  Bernie’s children, and the outpouring of love  and friendship that over 3,000 people shared  for over 7 hours at last evening’s wake.  It was obviously a great tribute to Martha—but it is also a great tribute to all who  waited  for hours to say good by to this  bright, shining lady.  Now, let me begin with the obvious: My  sister Martha is one fabulous gal!  And so we gather today to celebrate the  life of a spectacular wife, a devoted mother,  an  over-the-top  grandmother,  a  trusted  fiend, a tireless community activist, a political confidant, an amazing spark plug of a  woman, and the best sister a sibling could  ever hope to have.  When most people lose loved ones, they instinctively wish they could have had just a  little more time with them. The Dodds and  the Buonannos were lucky enough to be with  Martha constantly in the last days of her  life.  And those last days were beautiful. Even  as I say these words, they sound so inherently contradictory.  Yet for a little more than a week, my sister  insisted on spending time alone with  each of her five children and their spouses,  each of her 17 grandchildren, each of her five  siblings, as many of her close friends as were  available, and, of course, Bernie.  How many of us have lost someone without  ever having a chance to say goodbye, or the  chance to tell them how much they meant to  us?  Martha left us with remarkable dignity,  grace, and courage. She had the incredible  gift of deep, deep faith. She was truly at  peace.  And even though Martha has left us, we remain brightly lit by the incandescent life she  led. Frankly, as sad as we are today, it’s  hard not to be overwhelmed with joy and  love when we think about a life filled with  such vitality and vigor, curiosity and compassion.  Martha was a few years older than me. At  least, that was the case until about twenty  years ago. I was always the younger brother  until one night at the Dunes Club in Narragansett, when  she  introduced me as her  older, white-haired brother.  But, for most of our lives, she made for one  heck of a big sister.  I learned early how special my sister Martha was.  One summer afternoon, decades ago, we  were about to head off for a family vacation.  Our bags were packed, the station wagon was  full, and all of us were itching to get out of  town—but Martha’s 8th-grade championship  softball game was running late. So we all  waited together and watched.  In the bottom of the ninth, with the bases  loaded and her team behind, my sister Martha hit a grand slam home run to win the  game and the championship.  As I sat next to her on that car trip for our  family vacation, I was filled with the kind of  awe you only feel when you’re a fourth-grader with  the requisite dreams of being a  sports hero and you’ve just watched your  twelve-year-old sister win the big game.  Every time I drive by that softball field in  West Hartford, Connecticut, I can’t help but  think back to the day I officially, and forever after was dazzled by my big sister.  Nothing Martha ever did was shy or tentative. When she was just a toddler, during  World War II, she once devoured our entire  family’s monthly ration of butter. And when  our father wrote home from Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945, he always made sure to ask  how ‘‘Miss Butter’’ was doing.  Over the years, Martha never lost her love  of a good meal, but the most important part  of any meal, any occasion for that matter,  was always the company with which she enjoyed it.  If Martha were your dinner partner, you  never had a better or more enjoyable time in  your life. She was that much fun.  Like most people with a vibrant spirit and  a contagious personality, she made a lot of  friends in her life.  If you asked her, she’d tell you that our  sister Carolyn was her best friend in the  world. Martha had a lot of great friends, because when she made friends, she kept them  forever.  I.want to acknowledge the presence of several of my Senate colleagues who were with  us last evening and today.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  is here with us  today. She and Martha became friends in college, and have been close ever since.  I have never known two people who were  better friends to their friends than my sister  Martha and her friend Nancy D’Alesandro  Pelosi.  I want to also thank my good friend, and a  Martha Dodd Buonanno fan, Vice President,  Joe Biden, for making the effort to be with  us yesterday.  Here also with us today are friends from  high school, friends from college, friends she  made during her 45 years in Rhode Island,  and friends she accumulated at every stop  along the way.  Martha was  fiercely  sively competitive.  She was a natural politico. She was involved and present in every part of every  campaign I ever ran  for Congress or the  United States Senate. She was my unflinching advocate, my unyielding supporter.  And when I ran for President—a very brief  run, you may recall—she showed up all over  South Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire—  and anywhere else there was a debate or  forum or town hall meeting.  No matter where we were, she put the hard  sell on anyone she encountered.  Even as her health was failing last week,  she promised me that she would tear into  any opponents I might have from wherever  she was.  And in light of my present political circumstances, I told her there’d be no lack of  opportunity to use her talents.  However,  along with Martha’s  loyalty  came the requirement that you stay true to  yourself. So, she had no problem calling me  anytime to tell me in no uncertain terms  when I was screwing up.  Once, she called me and practically jumped  through the phone. ‘‘Why did you vote with  Jesse Helms?’’ she asked.  I asked her,  ‘‘Well, what  talking about?’’  ‘‘I don’t care WHAT the issue is! I just  can’t believe you voted with Jesse Helms!’’  It is important to point out that Martha  could be non partisan in her outrage. She  had a similar outburst once when I voted  with my friend Bella Abzug!  When she was in her last days in the hospital in Boston, I received a very kind phone  call from President Barack Obama, who was  concerned about her failing health and wanted me to pass along his and the First Lady’s  thoughts and prayers.  After the call, I walked back into Martha’s  hospital room, and said in the presence of  her family that I had just received a very important phone call—but I didn’t want to be a  name-dropper.  loyal and compulissue are you  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:28 Aug 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.105 E31JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2009

In July  2008, I took a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan to  assess the current conditions on the ground.  In  a  meeting  with  General  David  D.  McKiernan,  former  Commander  of  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and  former Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan  (USFOR–A), he emphasized that the most important tools needed to successfully conduct  operations are more ‘‘eyes in the sky,’’ also  known as unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAV).  Most  importantly,  this request will help save  lives through better intelligence gathering and  greater strike capabilities. Furthermore, Predator C means more jobs contributing to San  Diego’s local economy. Predator C will provide  the USAF and other customers with an additional covert capability, enhanced by much  higher operational and transit speeds for quick  response and quick repositioning for improved  mission flexibility and survivability.  f  THE CITY OF SAMMAMISH  HON. DAVID G. REICHERT  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 31, 2009  ",2009
1381,149,2009-07-31,Mr. REICHERT.," Madam Speaker, as  the  Representative of  the Eighth Congressional  District of Washington,  it  is my privilege  to  serve a vibrant cross-section of citizens  in  both rural and urban settings. And  in some  cases, I represent residents who are making a  swift transition between the two. This is especially true of Sammamish, a city of 40,000 that  was recently named by Money magazine as  the 12th ‘‘best place to live’’ in the entire country.  I rise today to congratulate Sammamish on  this  great  and well-deserved  achievement.  Nestled neatly on the eastern shore of Lake  Sammamish and  surrounded by a mix of  urban,  rural  and  beautiful  open  spaces,  Sammamish is as beautiful as it sounds.  Some of the qualities noted for their newly-  awarded  distinction  include  the  excellent  schools, safe neighborhoods and beautiful natural setting of the city. Of course, since I often  have  the opportunity  to visit Sammamish,  I  can definitely attest to that truth. Historically a  place of timber and agriculture, Sammamish,  barely ten years old, has impressed the entire  Pacific Northwest region with its rapid, elegant  and responsible development. The quality of  life, the political leadership and the energy of  its residents make Sammamish a very special  place.  Perhaps most  impressively, Sammamish  has invested heavily in infrastructure and an  expanding menu of city services without undermining its financial footing. Through careful  budgeting  and  long-term  planning,  Sammamish is moving ahead without leaving  responsible  habits  behind.  As  evidence,  Sammamish recently received Standard and  Poor’s highest bond rating—AAA.  I am proud to represent such a city in Congress and  look  forward  to continue working  with Sammamish residents and elected leaders  to continue  to make  it one of  the best  places to live long into the future. Working cooperatively,  the  residents  and  leaders  of  Sammamish  have  created  an  exceptional  place to live and visit in a short period of time.  I congratulate Mayor Don Gerend,  the city  council and staff and residents of Sammamish  for creating such a wonderful place to live for  long-time residents and newcomers, alike.  f  RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF JIM  MCCANN  HON.

1382,149,2009-07-31,Mr. TIBERI.," Madam Speaker, with great  pleasure I rise to recognize the distinguished  career of my constituent, Jim McCann.  For several decades, Jim served the Central  Ohio community as the principal of Westerville  North High School, passionately dedicating  himself to the education of thousands. We all  should strive  to make a difference  in  this  world, and Jim brought a remarkable level of  energy and decency to his job, winning admiration from the community for his commitment  to ‘‘The Warrior Way.’’  After retiring, Jim continued to give back to  the youth of Central Ohio by serving as a  chairman of my academy  selection board.  From that position, Jim took an active role in  mentoring applicants, often staying  in  touch  with them years after their first interview. To  this day, Jim continues to serve his community  in a number of civic committees, while also  still educating and guiding many youths in the  Westerville and Central Ohio area through his  home school program.  Through commendable volunteer work and  civic leadership, Jim stands as a pillar of the  Westerville, Ohio community. Therefore, I am  very pleased to thank him for all he has done  for our area.  I offer my congratulations to Jim McCann for  a career spent in service to others. I hope the  spirit he daily brings forth in his life and work  continues  to  inspire us  to action and a  renewed commitment to our country.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

Ruth was an aspiring writer and a teacher at  Pisgah country school. Her  reputation as a  quality  teacher and writer has been  recognized at Winterset High School where  the  Ruth L.

Carol Brooks Casey was a beloved citizen  with a long and distinguished record of community service.  Carol, a renowned radio announcer, began  her 32-year broadcasting career  in 1977 at  WMFC station  in Monroeville. Although she  initially professed a disinterest in radio, Carol  possessed self-confidence, determination, and  graciousness that earned her the affectionate  title ‘‘The Voice of Monroe County.’’ Her radiant presence brought joy to those with whom  she worked and earned her  ‘‘star  status’’  among her frequent listeners.  A leader for a host of philanthropic causes,  Carol was honored by the local Kiwanis Club  as its ‘‘2008 Citizen of the Year.’’ She served  as chairwoman for the Chamber of Commerce  Christmas Parade, was one of the organizers  of Excel’s Pioneer Days, established a Christmas toy drive for children, and helped promote  the national Angel Tree organization. She was  also an active member in a number of civic organizations,  including:  the American Cancer  Society, Peddlin’  for a Cure,  the American  Red Cross, Kiwanis Club of Monroeville, and  the Monroeville/Monroe Chamber  of Commerce, among others. She also organized the  first Veteran’s Day Parade in Monroe County  in 2007.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me  in  remembering a dedicated community  leader, a generous friend, and an inspirational  voice for Monroe County and Southwest Alabama. Carol will be dearly missed by her family—her husband, Mike Casey; her son, Calvin  Casey; her daughter, Adrienne Casey; her  three sisters, Helen Tucker, Land Watford,  and Wanda Brooks; and her brothers, Mike  Brooks and Cliff Brooks—as well as the countless friends and devoted listeners she leaves  behind.  Our  thoughts and prayers are with  during this difficult time.  Madam Speaker,  I ask  that  the  following  poem—written by Reverend Wayne McMillian,  pastor of the Mexia Baptist Church, as a tribute  to Carol—be entered  into  the CONGRESthem  SIONALRECORD:  A VOICEINTHEWIND  The Morning Dove arose with the dew  Her voice on the wind like pigeon flew  Bringing music, joy, and laughter she knew  Would brighten a dull and somber world.

I extend to all of her friends and family my  deepest sympathy for their loss.  According to the Rowlett Lakeshore Times,  ‘‘She took a medical leave of absence from  the chamber earlier this year but did not speak  publicly about her condition. Ethridge’s daughter, Laura Morris, said her mother was a constant source of encouragement.  ‘‘‘My mother was my best friend and my inspiration  in  life and spirituality,’ Morris said.  ‘There was no challenge too big. If someone  told me no, my mother taught me to find a  way to make it yes, but always with grace and  dignity. She  taught me  that  friendships are  one of the greatest gifts a person can give another person, and that one can never have too  many friends.’  ‘‘Ethridge served as the executive director of  the Rowlett chamber for more than 20 years,  and she helped the chamber grow from a one-  room office to its current building along Main  Street. She helped develop  the Leadership  Rowlett program and the annual casino night  fund-raiser.  ‘‘Chamber board member Staci Mauldin said  she will never  forget Ethridge’s unwavering  commitment  to  the community.  ‘I’ll most remember her for her dedication to the chamber  and  the business community here,’ Mauldin  said. ‘It was something that was very near and  dear to her heart.’  ‘‘Besides working at the chamber, Ethridge  also  enjoyed  gardening  and  enjoying  her  home. She and her husband, Robert, were  married about 40 years. Ethridge was also involved with  the Alpha-Nu Sorority, Keep  Rowlett Beautiful, Crimestoppers,  and  the  Rowlett Arts and History Foundation.  ‘‘Above all, Ethridge enjoyed a good laugh.  ‘‘‘The one thing that will always be with me  will be her contagious  laugh and beautiful  smile,’ Morris said. ’We loved to make each  other roll with laughter. I miss her deeply already.’’’  While representing the wonderful community  of Rowlett, I had the honor of getting to know  Mary Alice. She touched many of us in such  a positive way that her life will never be forgotten by those of us who had the privilege to  know her. Mary Alice was an outstanding individual and she will be dearly missed. I ask all  Members, please join me in honoring the distinguished memory of Mary Alice Ethridge.

I also want to  mention the Transportation Security Administration Reauthorization Act of 2009, which included an important section setting up a general aviation working group within the Aviation  Security Advisory Committee,  to advise  the  Transportation Security Administration  (TSA)  on security issues in general aviation. This advisory group was established after  the TSA  began rulemaking on the Large Aircraft Security Program that threatened to swallow general aviation amidst burdensome and unnecessary regulations, suited for large commercial  aircraft. Longstanding unattended issues and  insufficient attention to the nation’s important  General Aviation sector are finally getting the  attention they deserve. Along with other members of  the House Committee on Homeland  Security, I intend to see that General Aviation  security  issues are  treated uniquely  for  the  sector to administer.  1⁄3 YOUNG,  However, as most members who have sat  in on any hearing with the FAA, TSA, DHS or  any other security agency may now know, the  District of Columbia’s main airport, the Ronald  Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), is  uniquely hampered by  impossibly  restrictive  regulations that have destroyed general aviation in the nation’s capitol, and arbitrary practices may be  spreading  to others.  In  the  Homeland Security Committee, we have taken  the important first steps to give detailed attention to this major section of the airline industry  to the new administration.  After 9/11 the restrictions on General Aviation  in  the nation’s capitol,  in particular, became symbolic of arbitrary action against general aviation  that could happen anywhere.  Even though New York City was the epicenter  of 9/11, the nation’s capitol is the only location  that suffers under unique restrictions that have  crippled general aviation here.  In  fact,  there  was no general aviation for four years. After  joining  in my  complaints at hearings,  the  former Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, DON threatened  to subpoena any agency  that did not  comply with a bill that aimed to compel the resumption of general aviation  flights at DCA  and to hold them in contempt if they refused  to appear before the committee to report on  progress. As a result, a plan finally was put in  place  requirements  but  the DCA Access  Standard Security Program (DASSP) was almost worse than no plan at all. Before 9/11,  general aviation activity at DCA accounted for  (approximately 30,000) of the total annual  operations at DCA.  In contrast,  in October  2005 when program DASSP began, operations averaged about one  flight per week.  Today, activity averages about  three  to  four  flights per day, about 1,000 a year. The requirements in the DASSP include:  General aviation operators must adopt a security program, background check flight crews,  identify a security coordinator, and train on security procedures.  All DASSP flights must carry an armed security officer (ASO) on board (very few such  accredited officers are available).  Flights must depart from one of 27 TSA approved DASSP gateway airports. Full departure screening of crew, passengers, baggage,  and aircraft by TSA security inspectors.  Flights must request permission to operate  in DCA no sooner than 72 hours in advance  of  the  flight (due  to DCA slot requirements)  and no later than 24 hours in advance of the  flight (for TSA security reviews) for each flight  into DCA.  These same screening procedures must be  used for flights departing DCA.  Charges of approximately $230 are assessed  to cover TSA’s screening costs plus  $15/passenger  for screening names against  the No-Fly and Selectee lists.  Requirements for an Armed Security Officer  and use of a gateway airport are predictably,  and we think, deliberately impossible for most  operators to meet. TSA has approximately 200  registered operators  in  the DASSP, making  the wait for an ASO intolerable.  However, the Department of Homeland Security has determined  ‘‘that general aviation  presents only limited and mostly hypothetical  threats  to security  . . . (and)  that  the steps  general aviation airport owners and managers  have  taken  to enhance security are positive  and effective.’’ DHS goes further in its report  on general aviation:  ‘‘The current status of [general aviation] operations does not present a serious homeland  security vulnerability requiring TSA to increase  regulatory oversight of the industry.’’  ‘‘Although [TSA’s Office of Intelligence] has  identified potential  threats,  it has concluded  that most  [general aviation] aircraft are  too  light to inflict significant damage, and has not  identified specific imminent threats from general aviation’’.  Nevertheless, the nation’s capitol has been  singled out as the only jurisdiction under particularly onerous, unnecessary and wasteful  program restrictions. As the initial approach of  TSA  to general aviation  in general showed,  however,  the entire general aviation sector  was about to be buried by the Large Aircraft  Security Program, until our committee said  ‘‘NO!’’ The  thoughtless creep mission of  the  TSA into General Aviation, and the total failure  to weigh actual security risks against the implications of draconian security measures, was  stopped by our Committee on Homeland Security. The District of Columbia general aviation community deserves  the same  respect  and attention.  General aviation at DCA is not the only industry  in  the District of Columbia  that has  been wiped out by arbitrary and restrictive airspace regulations. The South Capitol Street  Heliport  is a commercial heliport  that once  served east coast cities such as New York,  Miami and Boston. It continues to serve the  Metropolitan Police Air Support Unit and the  U.S. Park Police. The heliport is also the point  of evacuation for the Supreme Court and part  of the Department of Defense Nightingale program. In fact, on 9/11 this heliport actually became the Air Control Command Tower when  DCA was evacuated. Moreover, having shown  it was a vital asset, not a liability, for two years  after 9/11, under an agreement with the Secret Service—an agreement  that was  later  adopted by the TSA to develop its Civil Aviation Security Rules—the South Capitol Heliport  continued to receive corporate commercial clients and news gathering helicopters. Yet,  without  explanation,  beginning  in October  2003, commercial operators have been altogether restricted from using the heliport, despite  the  fact  that  the heliport owners have  been clear that they are willing to comply with  any and all security demands.  The nation’s capitol has all but  lost helicopter service, even for the vital security purposes our heliport has performed. Without corporate commercial clients  the South Capitol  Heliport cannot generate enough revenue  to  survive. The owner has submitted the highest  level security plans, but the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security have failed to  respond. At my  request,  the Committee on  Homeland Security has added heliports specifically  to  the  list of entities on  the general  aviation working group. This heliport is vital for  both security and commercial helicopter operations that the District of Columbia cannot afford to lose. While we pause to recognize the  importance of general aviation  to  the U.S.  economy,  I use  this occasion  to remind my  colleagues in the Congress and the Administration to recognize the importance of general  aviation to the nation’s capitol.

1392,184,2009-07-31,Ms. SPEIER.," Madam Speaker, I pay tribute  today to a man of God who dedicated his life  to improving the lives of those less fortunate.  Father Floyd Lotito, the heart and soul of St.  Anthony’s Dining Room, left our world on July  14, ending his long and valiant struggle with  Parkinson’s disease.  Born  in Los Angeles, as Alfonso Joseph  Lotito, he  took Floyd as his religious name  when he entered  the Franciscan Order  in  1953, prior to being ordained into the priesthood seven years later. He received his Bachelor of Sacred Theology  from Old Mission  Theological Seminary  in Santa Barbara and  his Masters  in Speech and Communication  Arts from Marquette University.  Before joining the St. Anthony Foundation in  1968, Father Floyd spent  time as a high  school teacher in Santa Barbara and as a parish priest in communities all across our country.  When I think of Father Floyd, I remember a  man who knew everyone’s name, yet called  us all  ‘‘brother’’ or  ‘‘sister’’ as a sign of respect. He went out of his way to make people  feel special and was known locally for his annual Blessing of the Taxi Fleet and the Blessing of the Animals.  Father Floyd’s wisdom and eloquence garnered him invitations to give the benediction at  the 1984 Democratic National Convention  in  San Francisco,  the opening of Pacific Bell  Park in 2000, and many others.  The St. Anthony Foundation has ministered  to  the poor and down-on-their-luck  for more  than 40 years,  in  large part due  to Father  Floyd’s ability to reach people of all types in  profoundly personal ways. He did not see rich  or poor, he only saw  those who could help  and those who needed help.  Father Floyd held many positions at St. Anthony’s, but nearest to his heart was the St.  Anthony Dining Room. Opened in 1981, it is  now the leading free-meal program in the city,  providing more than 2,500 meals a day to San  Francisco’s poor. Earlier  this  year, Father  Floyd served his 35 millionth meal.  Madam Speaker, our community is fortunate  to have been blessed with Father Floyd. He  leaves our community better than he found it  and  it brightens my heart  to know  that San  Francisco has yet another angel to help guide  us.  f  A TRIBUTE HONORING THE  FALKENTHAL-NICHOLS WEDDING  HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 31, 2009  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I  rise today to extend my best wishes to two  young Americans who are starting their new  life  together. On  Friday,  June  4,  2009,  Michelle Lynn Falkenthal and Michael David  Nichols were joined in matrimony surrounded  by their loving family and friends at the Earl  Burns Miller Japanese Garden located on the  campus of California State University, Long  Beach.  Michelle Falkenthal was born in West Covina, California on December 24, 1979. Her  mother, Evelyn Bobbitt, is an accounting technician for the County of San Bernardino, and  her step-father, David Bobbitt, is a director of  audits for Riverside Community College. Her  father is Robert Falkenthal, an attorney in private practice, and her step-mother is Jennette  Falkenthal, a homemaker. Michelle graduated  from Colton high school and is currently employed as a billing agent for Cox Communications.  Michael Nichols was born in Arcadia, California on December 12, 1980. His mother,  Linda Nichols, is a secretary at Arcadia High  School, and his father, Ken Nichols, is a general contractor. Michael attended Arcadia High  School and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. He is employed as  an independent contractor pilot.  In  this constantly developing age of electronic communications, it’s no surprise that the  young couple first met via the internet. After  several weeks of getting acquainted online,  Michelle and Michael had  their  first date on  June 5, 2007. They were engaged  fifteen  months  later on September 14, 2008. The  couple enjoys spending time with family and  friends, going to Big Bear Lake, bike riding,  and remodeling their new home, among other  activities. Their many friends say Michelle and  Michael are very well suited  for each other,  and  their  families already consider each of  them a member of the family. The newlywed  couple will make  their home  in  the city of  Chino Hills in Los Angeles County.  Michelle and Michael were  joined  in  their  wedding celebration in Long Beach by guests  from across  town and across  the country.  Family and  friends  traveled  from Maryland,  Washington,  DC,  Sacramento,  Oxnard,  Newberry Park, the Inland Empire, and from  across  southern California. Special  participants in the wedding ceremony included the  maid of honor Casandra Holiday, the bridesmaids, Sally Lara and Evie Bobbitt, the bride’s  niece  and  sister  respectively,  and  the  groomsmen Travis Amezcua, Ryan Benigno,  Caleb Gray, and Dustin Mullins. Leading the  bridal party and assembled family and guests  in the wedding celebration and officiating the  vows was the Reverend Doctor Paul Yestebo  of the New Hope Community Church in Huntington Beach.  Madam Speaker, I offer my best congratulations  to  the Bobbitt, Falkenthal, and Nichols  families, and their friends and guests on this  happy and memorable occasion. To Michelle  and Michael,  I offer  the sentiment and gifts  which George Bailey offered the Martini family  as  they moved  into  their new home  in  the  classic  film,  ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life’’:  ‘‘Bread!  That  their house may never know hunger.  Salt! That  life may always have  flavor. And  wine! That joy and prosperity may reign forever.’’ Lastly, I wish that throughout their wonderful life together, Michelle and Michael will  always have an abundance of what St. Paul  wrote of in his letter to the Corinthians, ‘‘faith,  hope, and love; and the greatest of these is  love.’’  f  FOOD SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT  OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON. MICHELE BACHMANN  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 29, 2009  ",2009
1393,184,2009-07-31,Mrs. BACHMANN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in reluctant support of H.R. 2749,  the Food  Safety Enhancement Act of 2009. While I support the legislation, it is by no means perfect  and it is my sincere hope that the concerns I  share with my colleagues in the House will be  addressed as the bill moves through the legislative process.  Ensuring the safety of America’s food supply is a critical issue, which warrants our utmost attention. In light of recent outbreaks of  food-borne  illnesses  that have caused sickness and death in our country, I believe it is  imperative the action be taken to restore confidence  to  the American people  in  the  food  they eat. This task requires careful analysis of  our current food supply dynamic, as well as  thoughtful consideration of implications of any  potential solutions. Our constituents deserve  no less.

1394,4,2009-08-07,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, the editorial  reports on what they call a political  hit job perpetrated ostensibly against  me. It didn’t bother me, but as reported, the Chief of Staff of the President enlisted four Cabinet officers to  write letters to the Governor of Arizona, which were  seen by  some as  veiled  threats  to withhold  stimulus  funding because I had dared to criticize  the stimulus program and suggest that  after the first couple years of spending,  the outyears might be saved and spent  in better ways. That generated criticism by these four Cabinet Secretaries,  who wrote almost  identical  letters,  which clearly were designed to try to  intimidate.  That is not the right way for the administration to make its point. I am  happy to debate the success or failure  of the stimulus package with anybody  from  the administration who would  like to debate it. I welcome that kind  of conversation. But there seems to be  too much effort now to either shut people up or intimidate them from speaking.  There have been a lot of reports with  respect to the stimulus and the so-  called health care legislation, and in  other areas, to be coincidence. There  seems to be a pattern developing, and  it is not good. Senator CORNYN, yesterday, spoke to that issue with respect to  a new Web site that the White House  started asking people to send in their  observations of people who are criticizing  the administration’s plans,  if  they think some of the criticism isn’t  accurate or they said:  If you think  there is something fishy, let us know  about it.  These are the kinds of tactics that  might go over well in certain cities  that have had a history of political  bosses, but it is not the kind of tactic  you would  expect  from  the White  House. I hope the folks at the White  House have learned their lesson and,  frankly, will knock it off.  f  FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC  ",2009
1395,4,2009-08-07,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, there were  two items that came to my attention  that I wished to briefly comment on  that are related. The first has to do  with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  continuing saga of costing the American taxpayers a ton of money. We all  know that despite warnings, particularly  from Republicans, they needed  oversight,  that  they were  accumulating far too much bad debt and taking on all these so-called toxic assets—  mortgages that, frankly, weren’t going  to be paid back; that they were exposing the American taxpayer to liability  because of the implicit guarantee that  lay behind  the Federal  charter  for  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Others  said: Don’t worry, keep going with this;  it is a wonderful program. Finally, the  bottom  fell out. Fannie and Freddie  were deeply in debt and the American  taxpayers came to their rescue.  The  idea was  then  to  restructure  these two entities so that never again  could this happen. We did that. The  problem was that, because Fannie and  Freddie were government-chartered entities, it didn’t take long for them to  squeeze out most of the private players  in  the mortgage market. Today,  I  think they hold something like 75 percent of these particular mortgages.  Well, of course, the day of reckoning  has come again. They have now run up  more debt—a huge amount of debt—  and they are not going to be able to  pay it. A story in yesterday—I will get  the  source  later—reported  that  the  government has  since pledged, after  their  original  reorganization, more  than $1.5 trillion, including $85 billion  in direct aid, in order to keep the mortgage market working through Freddie  Mac and Fannie Mae. The White House  is now considering a new plan that apparently is coming out of the Office of  the Secretary of Treasury and the National Economic Council Director that  would  somehow  reform Fannie  and  Freddie yet again.  The Treasury Secretary said:  The only question that remains is what  form and what structure they ultimately  will take.  The article points out that the most  likely  structure  is a good bank/bad  bank structure, in which they will basically be relieved of all their obligations, which will all be put in a new  ‘‘bad bank,’’ which is a pile of debt that  the American taxpayers will eat, and  then the  ‘‘good bank’’  is the entity  that is supposed to continue on.  The question is: Why would we want  these  quasi-government  entities  to  continue to compete with the private  market, continue to create bad debt  that taxpayers have to eat every now  and then, and after we slough off the  bad debt to the American taxpayers,  they continue to do business as if they  had gone through bankruptcy and don’t  have any more debts but they still  have  the  implicit guarantee of  the  American taxpayers.  It is time to end that. We have a vibrant mortgage market now. There is  an expectation that within the next  several months  housing will  come  back. It already is in certain areas. Interest rates are low, and it is possible  to write mortgages  now. We  have  learned the  lesson that we are not  going to write mortgages that cannot  be repaid. It is not good for the financial institutions or for the people who  take out the mortgages if they cannot  repay them, and it is not good for taxpayers who have to end up eating the  bad debt that is created.  I wished to close by referring to the  penultimate paragraph from this newspaper, which says that the bad bank  would be for Fannie Mae’s and Freddie  Mac’s toxic assets. Then the government could create new companies to  attract private investment for mortgage finance, starting the process over  again.  Why should the government create  new companies? The private market  has an adequate way to deal with this;  it is called the private sector, private  companies. They are highly regulated.  The proposal from the administration  is to impose additional regulations, but  why do we need a new government  company? We have government insurance companies, government car companies, and  the administration proposal on health care is to create a new  government health insurance company.  We have banks taken over by the government.  Now we are going to fail to learn the  lesson with Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac  and  create  new  government-  backed companies, such as Fannie and  Freddie—maybe they have the same  name, who knows—in  the mortgage  business. When are we going to get out  of the business of having the government create new companies? That is  socialism, that is not American. That  is not our free enterprise system. When  things go wrong, we adjust and we  make new regulations to correct the  problems that were created; we learn  the lessons of why government created  the issue in the first place.  We don’t need to continue to have  the government create new companies  that cost the taxpayers money and get  us deeper into the notion that the government can compete with the private  sector. That, then, leads inevitably to  the government takeover because the  government is never a good competitor  when it is also the regulator. That is a  fear a lot of people have with health  care.

1396,11,2009-08-07,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, Representative John Randolph, chairman  of the House Ways and Means Committee in the early 1800s, said, ‘‘We all  know our duty better than we discharge it.’’  U.S. Customs and Border Protection,  or CBP, and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, or ICE, have two vital  duties. They must protect our national  security by ensuring that threats to  that security do not cross our borders,  and they must protect our economic  security by ensuring that  legitimate  trade does cross our borders, smoothly  and quickly. I have no doubt that CBP  and ICE know these duties. But they  must do a better  job of discharging  their trade duties.  Senator GRASSLEYand I introduced a  bill that would require the agencies to  do just that. The Customs Facilitation  and Trade Enforcement Reauthorization Act of 2009 would direct CBP and  ICE to make customs facilitation and  trade enforcement a priority again, and  it would provide the agencies with the  tools and resources that they need to  fully discharge those duties.  These agencies know that high-level  officials must focus on their trade duties. The bill would help the agencies  discharge those duties by creating new  high-level positions at CBP devoted exclusively to trade. The bill would assign new trade facilitation and enforcement duties to the highest level official at ICE.  The agencies know that they must  facilitate and expedite legitimate trade  across our borders. The bill would help  the agencies to discharge those duties  by providing trade  facilitation benefits, such as faster customs clearance,  to importers with a history of complying with U.S. customs and trade  laws. The bill would also require the  Secretary of Homeland Security  to  identify and provide trade facilitation  benefits to importers that provide additional security  information. The bill  would provide funding for automated  programs that would help CBP process  imports more quickly.  The agencies know that they must  enforce U.S. trade, intellectual property, and health and safety laws at our  borders. The bill would help the agencies to discharge those duties by giving  CBP new tools to identify goods that  are most likely to violate these laws. It  would give CBP the means to prevent  those goods from crossing our borders.  It would require ICE to do more to prevent the  importation of goods made  with  forced,  convict,  or  indentured  labor.  The agencies know that they must  listen to Congress and the business  community when taking significant actions that affect America’s competitiveness. The bill would help the agencies to discharge that duty by requiring CBP to engage in robust consultation before taking such steps.  The agencies know that they must  serve rural border areas, such as those  in my home State of Montana. The bill  would help the agencies to discharge  that duty by creating a pilot program  to establish 24-hour ports along these  border areas, ensuring that legitimate  trade can flow quickly through these  areas.  So let’s come together to reauthorize  CBP and ICE. Let’s give these agencies  the tools and resources they need to facilitate  and  enforce  international  trade. And let’s help CBP and ICE to  discharge these duties that are so essential to our economic security.  f  EXPAND BUILDING ENERGY  EFFICIENCY ACT OF 2009  ",2009
1397,11,2009-08-07,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about legislation that I introduced,  the Expanding Building Efficiency Incentives Act of 2009, which  would expand the tax  incentives  for  building and put our country on course  to reduce energy consumption in a sector that currently consumes 40 percent  of our total energy. I am pleased to  have worked with Senator FEINSTEIN  and BINGAMAN, two longtime leaders on  energy efficiency, on this proposal and  look  forward  to discussing  this bill  with my  Finance  Committee  colleagues.  One inexcusable legacy of this housing crisis is that the vast majority of  homes constructed over  the  last  10  years during the housing boon have  been  inefficient. While an  inefficient  vehicle purchased  today may guzzle  gasoline for an average of 10 years, an  inefficient building will  require elevated levels of energy for as long as 50  years. Therefore, whenever we create  inefficient  buildings,  generations  to  come will be saddled with our wasteful  energy decisions. Last week McKinsey  and Company in a report, ‘‘Unlocking  Energy Efficiency  in  the US Economy,’’ concluded that a major investment in energy efficiency could save  $1.2 trillion and cut consumption 23  percent by 2020. This legislation serves  as a cornerstone to realizing these opportunities.  The Expanding Building Efficiency  Incentives Act builds on current tax incentives that have worked to move the  market  toward  energy  efficiency.  While  the marginal  costs  of  constructing an energy-efficient building  may  be higher  than  an  inefficient  building, the long-term energy savings  have environmental and energy dividends, as well as ultimate cost savings.  These tax incentives provide an incentive to correct this market failure and  obtain these long-term benefits.  Specifically, the bill includes an extension of the current energy-efficient  new homes tax credit for 3 years, which  requires new homes to be 50 percent  better than current code with respect  to heating and cooling. In addition,  this bill will create a new tier for a  $5,000 tax credit if a building consumes  50 percent  less total energy than a  comparable building. The current tax  credit system for new homes has been  very successful. According to the Residential Energy Services Network, 4.6  percent of all new homes met these rigorous standards in 2008, which adds up  to nearly 22,000 homes being at the cutting edge of energy efficiency. This tax  credit is working and not only should  we extend this tax credit, but we must  build on this to encompass additional  energy consumption in a new home.  In addition, the bill would provide a  $500 tax credit for individuals to become professional energy auditors, experts that can reduce our country’s demand for oil, reduce carbon emissions,  and save our struggling families money  on their energy bills. In addition, a $200  tax  credit  is  established  for homeowners to hire these professional energy auditors and analyze  the deficiencies of an existing home and propose  investments that will save the  taxpayer money. As we move forward  with dedicating significant resources  to energy efficiency in this legislation  it is critical that we ensure that this  funding is utilized effectively by a professional  energy  efficiency  industry  and this amendment will accomplish  this critical goal.  Finally,  the  amendment  increases  the tax credit for energy-efficient commercial buildings by increasing the deduction from $1.80 cents per square foot  to $3.00 per square foot. The original  version of the commercial buildings  tax deduction as passed by the Senate  set the deduction to $2.25 per square  foot, with the critical support of the  current Finance chairman and ranking  member. Adjusting for inflation, this  corresponds to $3.00 per square  foot  today with  partial  compliance  increased to $1.00 per square foot. These  changes would return the deduction to  viability as it was originally designed  and ensure that commercial building  developers are provided an adequate incentive to pursue energy efficiency.  Earlier this year, a New York Times  editorial pointed out that we are an extremely energy inefficient economy—  the 76th best country in the world. This  must change if we are to retain our  leadership in this world, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to  improve our ranking and increase our  country’s energy efficiency.  f  CLEANER, SECURE, AND AFFORDABLE THERMAL ENERGY ACT  ",2009
1398,11,2009-08-07,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about the Cleaner, Secure, and  Affordable Thermal Energy Act, which  I introduced with Senator BINGAMAN.  This bill will add diversity to the fuel  usage of Americans who are forced to  use home heating oil, a heating source  that  has  gone  through wild  price  swings and last year reached historic  prices. While I strongly believe that we  must invest in weatherization and energy efficiency, I also believe that we  must create diversity for thermal energy.

I read faithfully  what is taking place because I am not  here all the time on the Senate floor.  He is bright, hardworking, and so nice.  He is going to be leaving the Senate to  go to the London School of Economics  for an advanced degree. I have tried to  talk him out of it, but not really, because he has various goals in mind. He  is going to complete his studies in London, come back and go to law school. I  hope after that time he will consider  coming back and working in the Senate. We will all miss him. He is a wonderful young man, and I consider him a  friend.  f  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10,  2009, AND TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER  8, 2009  ",2009

1410,8,2009-09-08,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, every  time we bring up a national heritage  proposal, we hear concerns expressed  about private property protections. We  should be clear that during the 20-plus  years of this program’s existence, opponents have not been able to identify a  single instance in which someone has  been deprived of the use of their property as a result of this designation.  Tens of millions of Americans  in  States across the country have lived,  worked and recreated and made their  living within a heritage area. Despite  the best efforts of opponents of these  designations, they have never found a  case where property rights were violated.  The Government Accountability Office even investigated potential property rights violations and found none.  Nevertheless, this bill contains extensive private property provisions. These  private property protections are the  same language approved by Congress in  earlier bills and signed  into  law by  both the Obama and Bush administrations. If the problem existed, the bill  has the  language necessary to take  care of it.  The other issue, in terms of law enforcement, this designation in no way  restricts  local, county, State or national law enforcement from carrying  out its enforcement mission and its responsibility to uphold the law. There is  no restriction, no impediment, and no  redesignation of  their mission. The  mission continues. The heritage area in  no way hinders or prohibits that mission from going on.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1417,8,2009-09-08,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1858) to provide for a boundary  adjustment and land conveyances involving Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, to correct the effects of an erroneous land survey that resulted in approximately  7 acres of  the Crystal  Lakes Subdivision, Ninth Filing, encroaching on National Forest System  land, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 1858  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT AND LAND  CONVEYANCES,  ROOSEVELT  NATIONAL FOREST, COLORADO.  (a) BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.—The boundaries of Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado,  are hereby modified to exclude from the national forest a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 7 acres within the  Crystal Lakes Subdivision as depicted on the  map entitled ‘‘Crystal Lakes Encroachment,  HR 3299’’ and dated July 15, 2008.  (b) CONVEYANCE OFLANDREMOVEDFROM  NATIONALFOREST.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall use the authority provided by  Public Law 97–465 (commonly known as the  Small Tracts Act; 16 U.S.C. 521c–521i) to convey all right, title, and interest of the United  States in and to the real property excluded  from the boundaries of Roosevelt National  Forest under  subsection  (a)  to  the  landowners whose real property adjoins the excluded land and who, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, occupy the excluded  land.  (c) CONSIDERATION.—The conveyances required by subsection (b) shall be made without consideration.  (d) DESCRIPTIONOFREALPROPERTY.—The  exact acreage and legal description of the  land excluded from the boundaries of Roosevelt National Forest under subsection (a)  and conveyed under subsection (b) shall be  determined by a survey satisfactory to the  Secretary.  (e) CANCELLATION OFPORTION OFUNOBLIBALANCE GATED IN FLREA SPECIAL ACCOUNT.—The amount available for obligation  as of the date of the enactment of this Act  from the unobligated balance in the special  account established for the Forest Service  under section 807 of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (16 U.S.C. 6806) is reduced by a total of $200,000, and the amount  so reduced is hereby cancelled.

1421,8,2009-09-08,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  1858,  introduced  by  Representative  BETSYMARKEYof Colorado, would provide  for a boundary adjustment and  land conveyances  involving the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado to  correct the effects of erroneous land  survey. The bill responds to an ongoing  boundary dispute between the Forest  Service and private land owners with  property adjacent to the forest.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend our  colleague, Representative MARKEY, for  her work on this bill. As a freshman,  she has demonstrated remarkable ability to get things done on behalf of her  constituents. I ask my colleagues to  support passage of H.R. 1858.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
1422,8,2009-09-08,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  This bill provides a legislative solution for a number of homeowners in  Larimer County, Colorado, who own  real property adjacent to the Roosevelt  National Forest. These homeowners  have occupied or improved their property in good faith and in reliance on  1975 land surveys.  It was introduced in the last Congress  by  Congresswoman  Marilyn  Musgrave. It is needed to resolve the  issue  fairly because a recent Forest  Service resurvey now claims that a  small portion of Roosevelt National  Forest is occupied by these adjacent  landowners.  This bill conveys approximately  7  acres occupied by the affected  landowners to those landowners, and I support its passage.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1425,15,2009-09-08,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill  authored by ELEANORHOLMESNORTON  that is, in fact, timely or perhaps beyond its time. This was passed by our  committee on a voice vote and is supported by all members of the committee.  Mr. Speaker, home rule by the District of Columbia will not be complete  until we harmonize as many rights and  responsibilities as we can to the District. Our committee is dedicated to do  that harmonization, to look for inequities, either by too much or too little,  much of it well-intended in the past,  some of it even needed in the past. But  as the District of Columbia takes on its  immediate  responsibilities, we must  also  treat  it appropriately and not  have it governed by special rules. This  narrowly constructed change will, in  fact, cause the Hatch Act to be identical  in the way  it  is  implemented  throughout the country, being implemented toward the District of Columbia.  I  think every American appreciates that if you lived in a city in  Maryland or in a city in Virginia, you  would have the same expectation of the  rules of national governance as you  should have here in the Nation’s capital if you’re involved in similar activity.  b1515  For  that  reason, on a bipartisan  basis, we support this simple but technically necessary fix.  I reserve my time.  ",2009
1426,15,2009-09-08,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to have the distinguished Representative ELEANORHOLMESNORTON  from the great District of Columbia  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2009
1427,15,2009-09-08,Ms. NORTON.," First off, Mr. Speaker,  may I thank the gentlewoman  from  California for her work on this bill and  for managing this bill as well and explaining it to the House.  I’m very grateful  to  the  ranking  member of the full committee for his  work on this bill and his cooperation in  helping us to move this bill forward.  Mr. Speaker, this is nothing more or  nothing less than a holdover from the  old pre-Home Rule days in the District  of Columbia. The Congress passed the  Home Rule Act and intended that local  laws would be a matter for the District  of Columbia, and somehow, this got  left out of the mix. And the OPM, the  Office of Personnel Management, and  its council’s office has been vexed—  that’s the only word for it—vexed by  these complaints that these sometimes  come and sometimes don’t.  For example, advisory neighborhood  commissioners, peculiar to the District  of Columbia, are  ‘‘elected officials.’’  They’re unpaid.  If you  look at  the  council of the District of Columbia, almost all of them were advisory neighborhood commissioners. But somehow,  people bring complaints against them  when  they  run  for  office  because  they’re not regarded in Federal law as  elected officials. They’re elected officials; unpaid, but they’re elected officials. They run for office. Those are not  matters that you would expect a Federal regulatory agency to pay any attention to. And I don’t want the OPM,  in fact, spending the time of its special  council on the arcane laws of the District of Columbia.  What this law says is you, D.C., will  have to have your own Hatch Act. The  Hatch Act was one of the great reforms  in government. Perhaps there’s no reform ever in government that’s been  more important than the Hatch Act.  This bill can’t go into effect until the  District of Columbia has its own Hatch  Act for its own local law, the way California and all the States of the Union  have their own version of the Hatch  Act. As I heard the ranking member  say, When  you’re  getting  Federal  money and you’re involved in Federal  matters—and  often matters  in  the  State are Federal matters—the Hatch  Act applies as always.  When you’re dealing  in D.C. with  D.C. management, you need your own  Hatch Act, and you need OPM to deal  with the often more serious matters  that affect  the Federal Government  when millions of dollars may be involved in Hatch Act violations.  I want to thank my good friends from  California, both of them, for their work  on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the District of Columbia Hatch  Act Reform Act of 2009 eliminates anomalous  treatment of  the District of Columbia which,  alone among U.S. jurisdictions, still falls under  the Federal Hatch Act as an uncorrected leftover provision from before the Congress made  the District an  independent  jurisdiction  that  today enacts its own local laws. Fortunately,  the House recognized that the present Federal  Hatch Act jurisdiction over the District was inappropriate and obsolete and  removed  this  Federal responsibility several years ago, but  the Senate failed to act. H.R. 1345 will eliminate  the double  indignity of placing a  local  burden on the Federal Government while depriving the District of a responsibility that only  local jurisdictions familiar with local laws can  be expected  to handle appropriately. H.R.  1345 retains Federal Hatch Act authority concerning prohibited partisan and political activity  that applies to every State and locality upon  receipt of Federal funds or functions, and importantly, requires the District to enact its own  local version of the Hatch Act barring similar  local violations before H.R. 1345 can become  effective. Local Hatch Act violations in the District are rare, but  the District needs  its own  Hatch Act to fully account and be responsible  for local violations, with which only a local, objective body would be familiar.  H.R. 1345 leaves in place the Federal Hatch  Act restrictions that apply to other jurisdictions  on the use of official authority, specifically as  it relates to elections; the solicitation, acceptance, or receipt of political campaign contributions; the prohibitions on running for public office in partisan elections; and the use of on-  duty time and resources to engage in partisan  campaign activity when Federal funds or responsibilities are  involved. My bill would remove only the Federal Hatch Act jurisdiction  that applies  to  the District of Columbia and  would require the District to enact its own local  Hatch Act, similar  to  those  in other  jurisdictions, instead of requiring the Federal Office of  Personnel Management, OPM, and its Special  Counsel  to devote staff  time and other  resources to investigation, fact-finding and judgment of unfamiliar local matters.  In  fact, OPM has asked  for  the Federal  guidance my bill offers. In recent cases, OPM  was confused by protests after citing an ANC  (Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner)  for  violations of the Hatch Act when he ran for  higher office, even though ANCs are ‘‘elected  officials’’ under D.C. law and therefore should  be permitted to run for higher office. As a result of the failure to clear up the confusion, the  application of the Hatch Act to ANCs has been  selectively enforced by OPM. For example, although OPM has filed cases charging Hatch  Act violations against an ANC running for the  D.C. Council, it more often has not filed when  several members of  the current D.C. City  Council ran for the D.C. Council from positions  as ANCs. These examples show the difficulty  created because Congress has failed to conform D.C.’s  local  jurisdiction created by  the  Home Rule Act of 1974 with the OPM’s Federal jurisdiction over Federal Hatch Act matters today.  This  is  an  uncomplicated  and  straightforward bill. It is not controversial, and it has  been enacted by the House before. I ask that  the House approve H.R. 1345.  ",2009

1433,22,2009-09-08,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise to express my strong concern over  U.S. policy  in Afghanistan.  I worry  that we are getting sucked deeper and  deeper into a war with no end. Our mission continues to grow and grow, with  no clear sense of where we are ultimately going. It has been 8 long years.  We have lost too many brave men and  women, and we have spent billions and  billions of dollars.  The Government of Afghanistan, led  by President Hamid Karzai, is incompetent and corrupt. The Afghan president has  formed alliances with warlords and drug-lords who have no interest in a better Afghanistan. His military is not reliable and his police are a  mess. By all accounts, forces close to  Mr. Karzai stuffed ballot boxes in the  most recent elections.  Madam Speaker, if this fraud had occurred in virtually every other country  in the world, the condemnations from  Congress and the administration would  be loud and forceful.  After all the sacrifices our troops  have made, after all the financial and  development assistance, after all the  training and military aid, is this the  best that we can expect? Don’t we deserve better? Don’t the Afghan people  deserve better?  At a very minimum, we must insist  that any aid be contingent on a responsible  Afghan  government. Without  that,  then all our  investments and  good intentions could achieve very little that is sustainable.  The United States has an incredible  and magnificent team assembled in Afghanistan. I had the pleasure of meeting many of them during a brief visit  to the country over the recess. Both  the military and State Department  personnel are impressive. I only wish  they were in place 8 years ago.  But even a brilliant team can’t make  up for the inadequacies of the current  Afghan government. Our troops are exceptional. I had the privilege of eating  dinner with many of them from Massachusetts. I am in awe of their courage  and commitment and their patriotism.  We owe them a policy that is worthy of  their  sacrifice.  Everyone,  Madam  Speaker, from the President on down,  agrees that a political solution is the  only path for a successful, stable Afghanistan.  During consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill a  few months ago, I, along with my colleague,  Walter  Jones,  offered  an  amendment that would have simply required the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress by the end of the year  what our exit strategy for Afghanistan  was. We are not asking for a date certain, we are not advocating an immediate withdrawal, but we wanted an answer to this fundamental question: At  what point has our military contribution to the political solution  in Afghanistan come to an end so that we  can bring our troops home?  I don’t believe that the United States  should enter  into a war without a  clearly  defined mission,  and  that  means a mission with a beginning, a  middle, a transition period and an end.  Without that definition and clarity, we  will continue to drift  from year to  year, from administration to administration. Madam Speaker, we need an  exit strategy for Afghanistan.

1434,29,2009-09-08,Mr. OBEY.," I thank the gentleman for  the time.  Let me simply say that I see Bill in  two ways. First of all, I see him as a  legislator. He was a good, solid legislator, a member of the Appropriation’s  Committee, and  I watched him day  after day conduct his business with  grace and with courage. It was not popular to oppose some of the tax and  budget  proposals  that  President  Reagan was pushing, for instance, in  the 1980s. I know in my district at the  time, 70 percent of the country favored  those changes. Bill Hefner had courage  enough to point out that the numbers  just didn’t add up and that he carried  on his conviction, and eventually facts  proved him to be correct.  Bill was also a person who respected  this institution. He respected the Congress, he respected the country, he respected his party, he  respected  the  other party, and he respected virtually  every person in this institution, and it  showed in the way he dealt with others  in this body.  But my greatest and fondest memory  of Bill is rooted in his gospel singing. I  happen to like bluegrass, and I belong  to a bluegrass band called The Capitol  Offenses, and I learned to love gospel  music. And on many occasions, Bill  would sing and I and members of my  band would back him up. And I have to  say, he was one of the best singers we  ever performed with. He knew a wide  range of gospel but he also had a solid  voice, and he had fun doing it. He loved  it, and anyone who  listened to him  knew that he loved it.  He was a man of courage. He had a  terrific sense of humor, and he could  find a lot of ways to get things done by  simply charming people in this place.  If  logic wouldn’t work,  if substance  wouldn’t work, there was always the  Hefner charm to push things over the  edge.  b2045  I was greatly saddened to learn of his  death last week. I have to say that I  am proud to have served in the same  institution with a man of his courage,  with a man of his integrity, and with a  man of his good humor. I’m certain  that he will be missed by his family  and his friends. I very much am grateful for the fact that I was able to know  him and to work with him for all of  those years. I thank the gentleman for  the time.  ",2009
1435,29,2009-09-08,Mr. KISSELL.," Thank you, ",2009
1436,29,2009-09-08,Mr. OBEY.,"  I would like to add there about Mr.  Hefner and his  showbiz background.  One of the descriptions that was given  of Mr. Hefner at one time that I think  he enjoyed the most was that it would  be recognized that he had a showbiz  background, but he was a workhorse,  not a show horse. That summed his career up very appropriately, and he did  enjoy that comparison.  His humor and his ability to charm  were pointed out to me one time on the  House floor. Evidently, there was quite  a serious debate taking place between  two sides of the aisle, and Mr. Hefner  somehow got  the attention, Madam  Speaker, of the Speaker at the time,  and got the attention of the full House  and looked at his watch and supposedly  said, How much longer is this going to  go on? Because I have to get home to  watch the ‘‘Andy Griffith Show.’’ And  in North Carolina there is no higher  calling than to go watch the  ‘‘Andy  Griffith Show.’’  At this point in time, I would like to  yield to CHETEDWARDSof Texas for the  time he may consume.  ",2009
1437,29,2009-09-08,Mr. EDWARDS  of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I consider myself blessed to  have known Congressman Bill Hefner.  He was a good, decent and caring person, and I will miss him dearly. While  this man of faith has gone on to a better place now, his work here on Earth  will continue to enrich the lives of millions of American citizens. There are  untold  thousands of our  troops and  families who are living in better housing today because Bill Hefner was their  champion. He not only worked hard for  his beloved Fort Bragg, North Carolina; he fought for a better quality of  life  for servicemen and  -women and  their families wherever they might live  in the world. As chairman of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Chairman Hefner  saw to it that the service and sacrifice  of our troops would be honored in a  meaningful way.  While Members of Congress  sometimes take ourselves too seriously, Bill  Hefner was a voice of self-deprecating  humor and humility. He took his work  seriously, but never himself too seriously. In doing so, he helped us keep  our proper perspective on ourselves and  our work here. He used to joke that he  had worked hard for over 20 years to  take a perfectly safe Democratic seat  in North Carolina and turn it into a  marginal one. That was a reflection of  his humor and his humility, because  the truth was that any political challenges that Bill Hefner might have ever  faced were because he was a person of  courage.  As Mr. OBEYpointed out, in 1981 he  was one of  the very  few Southern  Democrats who voted against the popular Reagan tax cuts because he felt  they would lead to large Federal deficits and ultimately undermine programs important to everyday working  Americans. As long as I knew him, he  always did what he thought was right  for his district, for our great country  and for average working families.  In an age of special interests, Bill  Hefner’s cause was to fight for the interests of everyday, hardworking families, the kind of people who fight our  fires, protect our streets, defend our  shores, educate our children and make  our factories run. He believed to his  core in the dignity of hardworking everyday American citizens.  Even after he retired from Congress,  Bill would often call me, and he called  when he was concerned that the views  of working Americans were not being  considered in Washington, D.C. Whether in office or out of office, Bill Hefner  lived his  faith by always being his  brother’s keeper.  Bill Hefner was a special personal  friend and a mentor to me. While I cannot fill his shoes or come close to it,  I’m a better Congressman and a better  person for having known him and having  learned  from him. I cherish the  many, many personal conversations we  had right here on the  floor, Madam  Speaker. I will always be grateful to  the very sage advice he gave me on a  golf course one day when he and I happened to be partnered against then-  President Clinton and the President’s  partner, when on the 15th hole in a  very close match, the President had  about a 31⁄2-foot putt. I was not going  to give it to the President, and Chairman Hefner called me over and put me  under his arm and said, Son, let me  just tell you something. Right now we  have this line item veto in existence,  and the Military Construction bill is  sitting on the President’s desk for signature, and you represent Fort Hood. I  gave the President his putt, and the  Fort Hood soldiers got their barracks  thanks to the sage advice of Bill Hefner.  The moment of so many wonderful  moments, but the moment I shall never  forget, was on June 4 of 1998 when Bill  Hefner stood in this very same spot. We  were debating an issue of the school  prayer constitutional amendment. And  I, consistent with my belief in the constitutional principle of church-State  separation, was opposing  the  Istook  constitutional  amendment.  During  that process I was personally attacked  by one particular  faith-based group  that claimed by not wanting to amend  the First Amendment to the Constitution I was somehow un-American and  even worse yet, I was accused of being  un-Texan. Leave it to Bill Hefner, the  man of the South, the gentleman from  North Carolina who sang gospel music  his entire life, a man of deep faith,  leave it to him to come to this very  spot to stand up and defend the integrity of his colleague who had been challenged. That was Bill Hefner, a man of  deepest integrity. And that is why I  will always revere him and what he  stood for.  To Stacye and Shelly, his daughters,  and to Nancy, his widow, I would simply say that if my two sons had every  right to be half as proud of me as you  have a right to be proud of your father  and your husband, I would consider my  life a success.  May God forever keep our friend, our  colleague, and a great American, Bill  Hefner,  forever  in His  loving arms.  Thank you.  ",2009
1438,29,2009-09-08,Mr. KISSELL.," Madam Speaker, to  kind of point out the legacy of how Mr.  Hefner  influenced  people  continues  today to reflect that, I had not been  sworn in but a matter of hours before I  got a phone call from Representative  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:04 Sep 09, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08SE7.065 H08SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
1439,36,2009-09-08,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for yielding. It pains me in a way  to be on the floor tonight to join with  Representative CARTERand Representative WESTMORELAND, my  colleague  from Georgia who just spoke, and Representative VIRGINIA FOXX,  a  great  Member on our side of the aisle from  North Carolina,  and  the  gentleman  from Texas, another gentleman from  Texas,  another  judge  from  Texas,  which we will be hearing from in a few  minutes.  But as painful as it is, Madam Speaker, to discuss a subject of this manner  and this magnitude, I think it is important that we do it. I think it is important that we have the courage to do it,  because I think the American people  are watching what we do.  I think that this recent district work  period, the month of August, the traditional time when Members are back in  the district meeting with their constituents holding these town hall meetings, and this is something that didn’t  just happen this August, by the way,  Madam Speaker, it has been a tradition  probably, I don’t know, for 100 years.  People  this year  though, while we  might typically have 25 or 50 or on a  really good day 75 people, it was 500  and 1,000 and 1,500 and it was unbelievable how engaged the American people  are now, who want desperately to be  heard.  Madam Speaker,  this  business  of  ‘‘being out of control’’ and  ‘‘being a  gang’’ and ‘‘being a mob,’’ no, no. They  are patriots, is what they are, Madam  Speaker. They are mostly seniors who  are worried about losing their coverage  under Medicare.  When they hear, particularly if they  are on Medicare Advantage, that that  program is going to be cut about 17  percent per year over the next 10 years,  I think $170 billion taken out of that  one program, where 20 percent of seniors, by the way, like that so much  that that is what they choose to receive their health care is Medicare Advantage and not Medicare fee-for-service.  So the point I am making is people  are outraged. They are so frustrated  that powerful Members of Congress are  not listening to them. And it is not always their Member, but it is the leadership. It is the committee chairs that  have control over significant pieces of  legislation, such as the America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009,  H.R. 3200.  They know  that Mr. WAXMAN is  chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, where most of the bill was  written. They know that Representative CHARLESRANGEL from New York,  a  long-serving Member  since  1971,  chairs the most powerful Ways and  Means Committee. They know  that  George Miller,  the  gentleman  from  California, a long-serving senior Member, chairs the Education and Labor  Committee. So they are very frustrated  and want to be heard.  So here we are talking tonight about  grave concerns that we fellow Members  have in regard to the ethical standards  and behavior of people in this body who  are in the highest positions. My goodness, the two most powerful standing  committees of the House of Representatives are probably the Appropriations  Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee. On the one hand, the Appropriations  Committee  is  charged  with spending the $3 trillion or so a  year in the Federal budget, and the  Ways and Means Committee, led by the  chairman, is charged with raising the  money to fund all these Federal Government programs.  People are getting a little concerned  and upset with $787 billion stimulus  packages and deficit spending in the  year 2009 of $1.8 trillion, and a deficit  that is calculated, not by me, not by  my Republican colleagues, but by the  Office  of Management  and Budget,  which  is  the number cruncher,  the  Ph.D. economists hired by and who are  part of the Obama administration, that  says that over the next 10 years there  is going to be $9 trillion of deficit in  the aggregate, that much more debt,  $20 trillion worth of debt at the end of  the next 10 years. So people are very  concerned about the integrity, the honesty and the fair play of these powerful  Members.  Our colleague from North Carolina  (Ms. FOXX) is so outstanding, and she  was talking  just a  few minutes ago  about the Old Testament and Moses  and the commands, and she can turn a  phrase better than I think most every  Member in this body.  But, I was reading recently in the Old  Testament  in  the Book of Deuteronomy, and Moses was saying to the  Jewish people, look, God gave me these  laws to give to you. These are not suggestions, these are commands, and you  are not to add to them and you are not  to take away from them. You are to  follow them exactly as God has commanded and has given that command  to me to give to you. Well, you know,  that is pretty sacred stuff, the ultimate sacred stuff, I should say.  But here in the House of Representatives, the rules of behavior, the standards of official conduct,  indeed, the  House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, are pretty darn sacred  too, Madam Speaker. And they are not  suggestions. They are really there so  that every Member is treated fairly,  from the least to the greatest, from the  freshman Member to the Member that  has served 35 years and is chairing one  of the most powerful committees  in  this House of Representatives.  So when we see things like this and  what  Representative  has  brought out  in regard to these new  findings of, oops,  I  just overlooked  $600,000 worth of income, it was a stock  CARTER account that I had  forgotten about,  well, you know, you don’t forget about  things  like  that. You  don’t  forget  about it.  To make sure, Madam Speaker, that  everybody understands, when we have  to fill out these financial disclosure reports on an annual basis as required by  the standards of official conduct, my  chief of staff will come to me and say,  Congressman, we need to go through  this 401(k), this IRA that you have had  when you were working as a physician,  and, of course, it is kind of frozen now  because you are not continuing to put  any money into it, but we have to look  at every mutual fund and go through  each one and see on each individual  stock within a mutual fund, and you  may have six or eight or ten different  mutual funds in a 401(k) or an IRA, and  my chief of staff says to me, Congressman, every stock in this, you have to  list whether it gained money or lost  money, whether something was bought  or something was sold.  It is very time-consuming and rather  painful, but it is for a good purpose, because the American people want to  know, they want to be able to look in  a very transparent way. They want to  know who are the wealthiest Members  of Congress, and they also want to  know who are those who have absolutely no assets, no wealth other than  their annual salary they receive from  the taxpayer from this House of Representatives.  b2200  It’s a point for a lot of people to try  to understand that, to follow the dollar  and see where maybe influences are applied and why people vote in the way—  or if there’s any suggestion that someone might cast their vote based on contributions or anything of that sort and  that no one is in here enriching themselves at the expense of John Q. Public  who  is struggling every day  just to  maintain a job and to feed his family  and support his children and hope that  they get to go to college some day. And  unfortunately, in this deep recession  that we’re in, some 6 million have lost  their jobs over the last couple of years.  So this is a very, very serious issue  that Judge CARTER, Madam Speaker,  brings before us, and I think that the  gentleman from New York who chairs  this powerful committee should step  aside while the House Committee on  Standards of Official Conduct is doing  its investigation.  Now, to his credit, he asked the committee to look into this over a year  ago. But, Madam Speaker, I feel that  he should have stepped aside at that  point. But now here we are a year later  and all of a sudden this additional  ‘‘Oops, I forgot.’’ Well, you know, if he  won’t voluntarily do this, then I think  it’s the responsibility of the leadership,  and ultimately the leadership of this  body, Madam Speaker, as you know, is  the Speaker whose seat you’re sitting  in  right now  as her  designee  this  evening. And she will be there tomorrow night  sitting  right  beside  the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:04 Sep 09, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08SE7.074 H08SEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
1440,43,2009-09-08,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," You  know, Mr. MEEK, I can’t help in listening to you but think of this debate  through my eyes as a mom. There’s  nothing more important to moms than  making sure that your children stay  healthy, and there’s nothing that tears  out a mother’s heart worse than looking at your child, knowing they’re sick  and knowing that you can’t do anything  to make  them well, and you  would do anything to make your child  well if you could.  Imagine layering on top of that angst  for a mother the fact that she wasn’t  covered by health insurance nor were  her  children,  and  as  a  result,  she  couldn’t even take her child to the doctor when they first got sick and she has  to wait and wait and wait until her  child gets sicker and sicker and sicker  until she has to use the emergency  room as her primary access point for  health care for her child.  Now, for me, we are at the point in  this country in our Nation’s history  where you  should not be  separated  from our ability to provide  for the  health and well-being of your child due  to the difference in your wealth.  When a child turns 5 years old in this  county, Mr. MEEK, Mr. RYAN, Mr. MURPHY, no parent has to worry about  whether they’re going to be able to pay  for their children’s education because  we have education that’s universal in  America. It’s a given. It was decided  over 100 years ago. Everyone gets equal  access to education and the government pays for it.  We’re not even going that far here.  What we’re  saying  is  health  care  should be a right and should not be a  privilege.  Mr. RYAN, one of the things that just  galls me, which is why I keep going  back to it, is how disingenuous our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have been.  Let me quote one of our colleagues,  and I won’t name her. She said this  last week to a conservative organization, and this was reported in the newspaper. A colleague of ours, in talking  about their views on health care reform said, ‘‘What we have to do today  is make a covenant, to slit our wrists,  be blood brothers on this thing. This  will not pass. We will do whatever it  takes to make sure this doesn’t pass.’’  And then she continued, ‘‘Right now,  we are looking at reaching down the  throat and ripping the guts out of freedom, and we may never be able to restore it if we don’t man up and take  this one on.’’  That is a direct quote from one of our  colleagues who  I won’t name, but,  Madam Speaker, I would like to enter  this into the RECORD.  TALKINGPOINTSMEMO: 9/1  Rep. Michele Bachmann (R–MN) spoke yesterday to the right-wing Independence Institute, the Colorado Independent reports, and  she called on conservative to really come together in the fight against President Obama  on health care.  ‘‘What we have to do today is make a covenant, to slit our wrists, be blood brothers on  this thing,’’ said Bachmann. ‘‘This will not  pass. We will do whatever it takes to make  sure this doesn’t pass.’’  The sanguinary rhetoric continued. ‘‘Right  now, we are looking at reaching down the  throat and ripping the guts out of freedom,’’  she said. ‘‘And we may never be able to restore it if we don’t man up and take this one  on.’’  Bachmann also denounced a system under  which some Americans pay half their income  in taxes: ‘‘It’s nothing more than slavery.’’  We don’t even have  to deal with  transparency because  it’s clear that  the stakes are so high for them. If I  hadn’t read it myself, I wouldn’t have  believed  it. The stakes are so high  here. They know that if we’re successful at finally reforming the health care  system and covering everyone, that politically next year they won’t be able  to be too successful in the elections.  And that’s what it’s about for them,  it’s about power.  ",2009
1441,43,2009-09-08,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," I want to say two  things and then I will be done for the  night, too.  There was this interesting article in  Newsweek this week. It was about a  book about William F. Buckley and  about the battle between the extreme  right wing of the Republican Party and  the William F. Buckley National Review kind of wing, and there was this  little battle post-New Deal.  But it’s interesting to note that right  after Roosevelt got in, there was this  extreme reaction, very similar to what  we’re seeing where every critique of  what Roosevelt was doing was socialism, communism, and all of these fancy  names. But there were also these vigilante minutemen who would show up  at these events carrying their guns,  and it was amazing, because that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here.  There’s no solution. There are just  these critiques of how the train is moving down the track. The American people want to go in another direction.  But I wanted to share this story because I think this is what we’re all  talking about.  I ran into this woman at the Canfield  Fair. I stood outside the Democratic  Party tent. This is one of the biggest  fairs in Ohio over Labor Day. I stood  there for 4 hours, 4 hours, just south of  Youngstown, Ohio. I had two people  out of all the entire time come up to  me and say, What are you doing with  this socialist—and they’re also against  the energy bill, so it was totally the  right wing talk radio crowd that was  like inundating them with this stuff.  Two people came up against this.  But what this one woman said, she’s  35 years old, married, kid. Husband just  lost a job. They made about $58,000 a  year when he worked. They now make  $32,000 a year. She is working.

1450,64,2009-09-08,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, 45 minutes ago exactly, history was made in  America just across the street, not far  from the steps of the Senate. If you go  to those steps at this moment and look  directly to the east, you will see the  U.S. Supreme Court building. At  2  o’clock eastern time in that building  the 111th Justice appointed to the U.S.  Supreme Court received her official investiture. It was a moment of great  historic significance because the elevation of Sonia Sotomayor to serve on  the U.S. Supreme Court marks the first  time in our history that a person of  Hispanic descent will  serve on  the  highest Court of our land. In the course  of our history, with 111 Supreme Court  Justices, if my memory serves, only  four have not been White males—two  African Americans, two women, and  now Justice Sotomayor.  The ceremony was very short. The  President of  the United States was  there, the Vice President, a number of  Members of Congress, and of course the  other eight Supreme Court Justices  and the retiring Justice Souter. There  was a very stately, dignified, gracious  presence as the Court was convened.  After Eric Holder, the Attorney General, read the commission which authorizes  the  investiture  of  Justice  Sotomayor, the oath was administered  to her by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. The entire  ceremony took 4 minutes. One of the  Senators standing next to me, MEL  MARTINEZ, who will retire  from the  Senate this week, said it would have  taken  longer  if  they had  television  cameras here. Those of us who serve in  the Senate and served  in the House  know of what he speaks.  But the fact is, in that 4-minute period of  time a page was  turned  in  American history. We are offering an  opportunity now for a person to serve  on  the  Supreme  Court—immensely  qualified, a person with a great background in her life and her achievement  to serve on the highest Court of the  land.  Across America,  in neighborhoods  and  towns  and  communities  and  schools, perhaps a child will look up  and, when they learn of the appointment  and  ascension  of  Sonia  Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, realize that the great promise of America  continues, that this still is a land of  opportunity, and that door to opportunity was opened a little wider just  across the street at the U.S. Supreme  Court about 45 minutes ago.  f  RESPECTING THE PRESIDENTIAL  OFFICE  ",2009
1451,64,2009-09-08,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, earlier  today  the President  of  the United  States went back to school. He went to  a local high school in the DC area to  give a speech. It turned out that this  speech became controversial.  I thought about that over the weekend because my wife and I went down  to Mount Vernon, in Virginia, to the  home of George Washington. It was a  trip I promised my wife because the  first time we went down there when I  was a college student and drove down  there in my little VW bug back in the  1960s, I got there to find out I did not  have enough money for admission so  we had to turn around and leave.

1452,71,2009-09-08,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, my colleague, Senator MCCAIN, has spoken to  the issue that is on the minds of all  Americans today and which the Senate  and House  of Representatives will  again take up as we return from the  August recess; that is, how to deal with  the issues that confront us in the delivery of health care today without doing  damage to the care and the coverage  that most Americans have and believe  serves them well.  The approach I heard from my constituents over the recess was very similar to what Senator MCCAINhas spoken  about, which should not seem to be a  big coincidence since we represent the  same State. On one occasion we called  about 50,000 Arizonans, had them on  the telephone for about an hour and a  half, and asked  for their views, and  gave our thoughts in response to their  questions.  What I have been struck by is the  consistency of the views that have been  expressed in the various forums I had  around the State, consistent with the  townhall meetings Senator MCCAINhad  right in the heart of the Phoenix metropolitan area, views people expressed  to me in every location, from the doctor’s office I went to, to people meeting  with me  in my office,  to  folks at  church. The message seems to be pretty much the same. And I think Senator  articulated  it well when he  characterized  it as anxiety and concern.  One of my colleagues said he denoted  in his constituents, in these townhall  meetings, real  fear.  I think that  is  true. Because even though we know  there are some things that need to be  done to improve health care delivery in  this country, most people, according to  surveys, have  insurance and believe  what they have serves them very well  or at least well. Our goal, therefore, is  to try to solve the specific problems  that exist without doing harm to the  system that treats the others.  As I said, a lot of our constituents  were very fearful that they were going  to have to pay much more in taxes;  that their debt burden as a part of  what this entire country owes would be  increased significantly because of the  costs of the health care reforms that  have been proposed; that they wouldn’t  be able to keep the insurance they have  even if they like it; that the way they  receive care—the advice they get from  their doctor about what their family’s  needs are—would not necessarily be respected if the government has a large  role in deciding what to pay for and  what not to pay for; and generally that  the government’s continued takeover  piece by piece of the American economy would not serve individual Americans well. To be sure, they agreed that  some health care costs are growing too  fast and need to be controlled and that  there are some Americans who don’t  have health coverage and really don’t  have a way to get it without public  health. Those are the two key areas in  which they recognize there is a role for  government to play in reform.  But they also wonder why certain  problems are not being tackled—the  problem,  for  example, of what one  characterized  as  ‘‘jackpot  justice,’’  where trial lawyers bring lawsuits and  sometimes get big  rewards but  frequently simply settle the cases, and  the net result is that the medical profession  in this country—doctors primarily but hospitals and others—spend  an enormous amount of money, estimated to be at least $100 billion a year,  on what is called the practice of defensive medicine; that  is to say, doing  things—ordering  tests,  referring  patients to other physicians and so on—  all of which are really unnecessary for  the care and treatment of the patient  but which will protect the doctor in  the event there is a claim of medical  malpractice. This happens because the  lawyers involved get so-called expert  witnesses who come to court and tell  the jury that the standard of care in  the community is that if the child falls  down on the playground and gets a  bump on the head, you order a CAT  scan. It doesn’t matter whether or not  from the physician’s observations he  can see that the child really, if the parents  just watch him carefully  that  evening, should be just fine; no, to protect himself or herself against medical  liability or malpractice claims, they  order a CAT scan or some other kind of  test. The net result of that, as I said, is  an expense of over $100 billion a year in  unnecessary medical tests and procedures. The  cost of  those  items, of  course, is passed on to all the rest of  us.  Another estimate is that 10 percent  of every health care dollar is spent on  the  premiums  physicians  spend  for  their malpractice  insurance. As  lawyers, some of us know you have to pay  some money for malpractice insurance  before you can start work on January  1. That is fair. But how about $200,000  in medical malpractice premiums for a  neurosurgeon, for example. That is an  awful lot of money if you are an OB–  GYN, for example. This estimate of 10  percent of health care dollars spent on  premiums means that if we could reduce  the  incidence  of malpractice  claims, we could reduce that premium  cost, the physicians wouldn’t have to  pass it on to the insurance companies,  who wouldn’t have to pass it on to us,  and again, our health care could be  cheaper.  So because of premium costs and because of the practice of defensive medicine, this jackpot justice system has  not served us well.  One would think that if we are interested  in controlling costs,  if we are  making insurance more affordable for  small businesses—for big businesses,  for that matter—for their employees,  and for us as individuals, and if we  want to encourage more physicians to  stay in practice, then what we would  do is tackle this problem. Is there one  word about medical malpractice reform  in any of the bills, the bill that came  out of the HELP Committee  in the  Senate, the bill currently pending in  the Finance Committee, or the bill  that came out of the House of Representatives? The answer is no, not a  word about medical malpractice  reform. Why? Well, Howard Dean, the  former  Democratic  Governor  of  Vermont  and  Democratic  National  Committee chairman, was very honest  about this on August 17 at a townhall  meeting with Representative MORAN in  Virginia. He was asked that question,  and he said: When you write a big bill,  you don’t want to take on too many  special interests, and the people who  wrote this bill simply didn’t want to  take on the trial lawyers, and, he said,  that is the truth. It is the truth.  The reality is that the President is  going to ask everybody else to sacrifice. For example, seniors are going  to have to take a $400 billion to $500  billion cut  in Medicare, which will  mean less care for them. If small businesses are going to have to pay a tax  on every one of their employees  in  order to make sure they get covered  with insurance; if the pharmaceutical  companies are going to have to pony  up—I have forgotten how many hundreds of billions of dollars it was for  more drugs for seniors, for example; if  everybody else is going to have to sacrifice, why didn’t we ask the poor trial  lawyers to give up  just a  little bit  here? We are not saying malpractice  claims couldn’t be filed. That is the  way doctors and hospitals and others  are kept honest. When you make a mistake, you are going to have to pay for  it. But we can make sure the system  works to prevent the kind of jackpot  justice I spoke about.  There are at least five different kinds  of medical malpractice reforms that  have worked. One was offered by Senator ENZIin the HELP Committee; it is  called health  courts. The State  of  Texas and the State of Arizona have  both adopted certain kinds of medical  malpractice reforms. In Arizona, it has  begun to work. In Texas, something  like 7,000 doctors have moved into the  State, with premiums being reduced by  either 21 or 23 percent. In other words,  medical malpractice costs can be reduced to provide care, and by reducing  that cost, people’s premiums can be  cut, and that will make insurance more  affordable and more people will be able  to get it.  My point here is simply to say this:  What we found as we talked to our constituents was a fear that in order to  solve two or three very discrete problems, there were people here in Washington who wanted  to  remake  the  whole system, throw out what we have,  and impose on it a new regulatory regime. Whether there is a government  option or government insurance plan is  only part of the issue. The problem is  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:06 Sep 09, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G08SE6.012 S08SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

All of us who just went back  to our home States realize there are a  lot of people who are truly hurting out  there. It is not just people who have already lost their jobs, but there are a  lot of people who are afraid they are  going to lose their jobs.  There are people who are afraid to invest to create jobs. I would say the  number one emotion I heard during the  August recess was that of fear. It is  fear of what is going to happen in this  country. I think Senator DORGANeloquently put it that this bill is about  jobs. It is about creating jobs without  adding to the Federal debt.  Another thing I heard throughout the  State of Nevada is that people are very  concerned about Federal spending and  the deficits this year we are facing.  This looming Federal debt that people  believe is a threat to the future of the  United States. This  bipartisan  bill  helps create jobs without adding to the  deficit.

1456,85,2009-09-08,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, today  I rise to bid farewell to TEDKENNEDY,  a man who spent so many hours on this  floor. It was here that he engaged in  the cause that shaped his life, and now  shapes our memories his commitment  to everyday people in their pursuit of  the American dream.  It is hard for me, as it is for all my  colleagues, to imagine this place without TEDKENNEDY. To serve here with  him was a great honor. At the age of 14,  I was already wearing a TEDKENNEDY  for President button. Then when I arrived here, this man, this lion of the  Senate, was so friendly and funny and  generous. He helped to teach me the  ropes in the Senate, and I felt so fortunate to know him as a person, not just  to admire him from afar.  He and his family are one of the reasons I stand here today. His work in  the Senate, his brother John’s call for  a new generation to serve their country, and his brother Bobby’s call for social justice all these inspired me to run  for office to  in some way serve my  country as Senator KENNEDY and his  family had. One of the greatest honors  of my life was winning the Profiles in  Courage Award with Senator MCCAIN,  and being recognized by members of  the Kennedy family for our work on  campaign finance reform.  Having Senator KENNEDY there that  day was part of what made that such  an honor. There was no one else like  him; he was truly one of a kind. Who  else could be such a fierce advocate,  and at the same time such a skilled negotiator? Who else could engage  in  such heated debate, but still count so  many of us, on both sides of the aisle,  as devoted  friends? No one but TED  KENNEDYcould do that.  His qualities were legendary he was  the  hardest  worker,  he  was  the  quickest debater, and he was the guy  who lit up a room with his warmth and  wit. It was all there in one extraordinary man, who became one of the  greatest United States Senators in our  Nation’s history. Even putting aside  TED’s legendary personal qualities, his  legislative  record  speaks  volumes  about how effective he was. It  is a  record for the ages, with hundreds of  his legislative efforts becoming law.  His achievements in civil rights, education, health care, and workers’ rights  speak to the absolute commitment he  had to the people he saw who struggled  to live the American dream; the dedicated people who are the lifeblood of  this country, but who struggle—especially in times like these—when they  lose their job, or their health insurance  or their home. In TEDKENNEDY, those  Americans found their champion, and  we  thank  him  for  everything  he  achieved on their behalf.  I admired so many things TEDKENNEDYdid, but most of all I was inspired  by his work on civil rights. His commitment, through his 47 years in the  Senate, to the cause of equality for  every American, was perhaps his greatest achievement of all. In his very first  speech on  the Senate  floor,  just  4  months after his brother John’s assassination, he called for the passage of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He played  a key role in the Voting Rights Act of  1965, was the chief sponsor of the Voting Rights Amendments Act of 1982,  and just a few years ago was a key cosponsor of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa  Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting  Rights  Act  Reauthorization  and  Amendments Act of 2006. He was one of  the chief cosponsors of the Americans  with Disabilities Act of 1990, the chief  sponsor of the Civil Rights Restoration  Act of 1988, and a key proponent of  theCivil Rights Act of 1991. And the list  goes on, Mr. President. There simply is  no doubt that he was the most important legislative architect of the expansion of civil rights in the last half century. I am committed to helping to  continue that work here in the Senate  in his memory.  TEDwas also someone who suffered  many personal tragedies, but he bore  those burdens with a quiet dignity that  came  from  his  tremendous  inner  strength. You couldn’t know him without being awed by that strength, and  sensing  it whenever he entered  the  room, or when he took up an issue.  When he spoke, his words echoed not  just in this Chamber, but across the  country and around the world. This  was a man who could change the momentum on a bill or an  issue  just  through his own personal will. He was  a powerful person determined to help  the powerless in our society, and we  loved him for it.  I think ‘‘beloved’’ is the best word to  describe how we felt about him here in  the Senate, and how so many Americans felt about him around the country. We are grateful that he lived to  achieve so much, and to  inspire so  many.  And now we wish, as he did when he  laid his brother Robert Kennedy to  rest, that ‘‘what he wished for others  will someday come to pass for all the  world.’’ And now we pledge, as he did  at the Democratic Convention in 1980,  that ‘‘the work goes on, the cause endures,  the hope  still  lives and  the  dream shall never die. ‘‘ And now, as  we grieve his loss, we say goodbye to  our friend, Senator EDWARDM. KENNEDY. We thank him for his lifetime of  service to our country, and for his profound commitment to the cause of justice here  in  the United States and  throughout the world.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  REMEMBERING ALLAN TESCHE  ∑",2009

Former  Anchorage  Assemblyman  Allan Tesche passed away July 14, 2009,  after complications  from heart  surgery.  Allan Tesche was the embodiment of  a true Alaskan and an incredible public  servant. While I was mayor of Anchorage, Allan  served on  the Assembly.  During this time, I got to know Allan  and his family well. He was committed  to the residents of Anchorage, and his  dedication to making our city a better  place was second to none. He and his  wife Pam were active members of the  community and raised their two children in Anchorage.  On behalf of his family, many friends,  and colleagues, I ask today we honor  Allan Tesche’s memory. I ask his obituary, published July 26, 2009, in the Anchorage Daily News, be printed in the  RECORD.

A memorial service will  be at 2 p.m. Monday at Central Lutheran  Church. Allan was born Aug.  3,  1948,  to  Marilyn and Frederick Rutledge Tesche in  Los Alamos, N.M. He graduated with honors  from the University of California at Davis in  1970. In the Peace Corps, he spent two years  in El Salvador supporting Community Development projects. Upon his return, he enrolled in law school at the University of California at Davis, where he was an honorary  member of The Chicano Law Students Association. In his second year he was recruited  by the Greater Anchorage Area Borough to  serve a six-month internship in the Anchorage Borough Attorney’s Office; thus began  his  long association with Alaska government. Allan was invited by Mayor Jack Roderick to return after graduation as a staff attorney. Allan’s work on borough-city unification in 1975–76 led Mayor George Sullivan  to elevate him to deputy municipal attorney,  a position he held until his appointment to  lead the Mat-Su Borough Legal Department  in 1980.

These employees have a wide range  of responsibilities  that support  the  legislative  process, assure the security of the institution,  and maintain our technology and service infrastructure. They have accomplished a great  many things in a wide range of activities, and  the House of Representatives and  its Members, staff, and the general public, are better  served because of them.

MIKE PENCE  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 8, 2009  ",2009
1461,106,2009-09-08,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  with a heavy heart  to pay  tribute  to a dear  friend and  to honor  the memory of a great  man who will long be remembered in Columbus and across the State of Indiana as a business and community leader.  For years, Dick Johnson was regarded as a  role model in the business community of eastern Indiana. Dick will be remembered for his  willingness to share in his successes with others; he will undoubtedly be missed by his  wonderful  family, but also all  those whose  lives he touched.  Dick Johnson was born on November 25,  1932 in Fort Wayne, Indiana to Samuel Gideon and Jessie Loomis Johnson. Dick spent  his youth  in Fort Wayne before graduating  from the Indiana University School of Business  in 1955.  At IU, Dick showed the promise of a young  man committed to honesty and integrity that  would be  fulfilled each day of his  life. Dick  earned the nickname ‘‘honest Abe’’ and was  elected president of his fraternity, Sigma Alpha  Epsilon.  Dick also demonstrated his love for country,  completing ROTC  training and serving as a  Lieutenant in the U.S. Army from 1955–1957.  Dick began his business career  in 1957  when he purchased a Shell Oil distributorship  which would become  the Johnson Oil Company. Dick’s business acumen was evident as  the company grew and diversified under his  leadership.  In 1981, Johnson Oil Company opened its  first convenience store  in Nashville,  Indiana.  Now  the Bigfoot Food Store chain operates  more than 200 locations in Indiana, Kentucky,  and Illinois.  Dick was often recognized for his leadership  in the business community, serving as President of the Indiana Oil Marketers Association  and on  the National Distributor Council  for  Shell Oil. He was also honored as the 1988  Columbus Small Business Person of the Year,  the 1994  IU Distinguished Entrepreneur and  the 2000 Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the  Year.  Dick Johnson will always be remembered  for what he accomplished  in  the business  world, but those closest to him also know of  a kind-hearted man with a commitment to his  community.  He chaired the Columbus Front Door Committee and served as the president of many  organizations over the years including the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, the Heritage  Fund of Bartholomew County, the Columbus  Economic Development Board, and  the Columbus Regional Hospital Foundation.  Dick and his beloved wife Ruth were also  significant philanthropists, donating to causes  such as the Columbus Area Arts Council and  the Columbus Senior Citizens Center.  As a proud graduate of Indiana University,  Dick was so very proud of his founding sponsorship of  the Johnson Center  for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Kelley School  of Business.  I first came to know Dick Johnson as a respected competitor of my father in the business world. Then, as now, Dick Johnson was  admired for his devotion to his faith, his family,  his business acumen and his unblemished  reputation for integrity.  Dick Johnson was a public man who saw  business as a means to improve his community, his state, his university and his nation.  To his loving wife Ruth, his children and entire family I offer my deepest condolences and  prayer  that  they may be comforted with  faith we share.  Columbus and Indiana have lost a giant and  I have lost a cherished mentor and friend.  the  f  HONORING KENNETH TAYLOR  HON.

1462,106,2009-09-08,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  to honor  the  life of Kenneth  ‘‘Kenny’’  Taylor upon being named by the Madera District Chamber of Commerce as a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award, Memorial Honoree.  The  life of Mr. Taylor will be honored on  Wednesday, August 26, 2009 at the Fifth Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards and Installation Dinner.  Mr. Kenny Taylor was born at Dearborn  Hospital in Madera, California, to Minnie and  Marie Taylor. He graduated from Madera High  School in 1968. He attended Fresno City College, and in 1970 joined the family business,  Taylor Insurance; he later bought the company  from his father. Throughout his career he was  a trusted and respected professional. Mr. Taylor  treated his business and customers with  unquestionable integrity.  Mr. Taylor was proud of his community and  Madera High School. He was a member of  Saint Joachim’s Church, the 20/30 Club, Exchange Club, Kiwanis Club, Madera Babe  Ruth, Madera Elks  Lodge, Fresno/Madera  Basque Club, and Madera Golf and Country  Club. While active with  the Exchange Club,  Mr. Taylor created  the  ‘‘Boy of  the Month  Award’’  to recognize  the all-around achievement  of  senior  high  school  students  in  Madera. When the Exchange Club closed its  doors, Mr. Taylor joined the Kiwanis Club and  brought  the award with him; he  funded  the  program out of his own pocket. He attended  as many Madera High sporting events as possible; he coached baseball and played golf.  Once, Mr. Taylor attended a Madera High  cross country meet and realized many of the  athletes did not have proper shoes. Without a  word, or attention brought  to  the situation,  those athletes had new shoes provided  to  them at no cost. That was the kind of person  he was.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  posthumously honor the life of Kenny Taylor upon  being named the Madera Chamber of Commerce 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award Memorial Honoree. I invite my colleagues to join  me in honoring Mr. Taylor’s life and best wishes for his family.  f  TRIBUTE TO WEST MORGAN HIGH  SCHOOL  HON.

Douglas Lee.  Not only was Dr. Lee recognized for his outstanding leadership and dedication to Stetson,  he was also well known for his contributions to  community, state and nation. It was an honor  and privilege to know Doug and his wife of 44  years, Margaret, and  to call  them wonderful  friends.  In his 22 years as President, Doug worked  on countless projects  to enhance  the educational opportunities at Stetson. Most  recently, I had the privilege to work with Doug  in the renovation of Sage Hall.  In 2007, Doug came to me and shared his  vision  for renovating Stetson’s Sage Hall  to  strengthen the science curriculum at the University. Through private  fundraising,  federal  support and an enormous amount of dedication, Doug saw this project through to completion. The Sage Hall project, a 20,000 square  foot addition with new science equipment, was  completed and rededicated earlier  this year,  and will remain a testament to Doug’s commitment to quality education.  To Doug’s wife Margaret; his son Gregory  Lee and wife Lara; daughter Elizabeth Lee  Williamson and husband Heath; grandsons  Parker  Lee,  Grayson  Lee  and  Ayers  Williamson;  granddaughters  Maggie  Williamson and Piper Williamson;  father, Dr.  Howard Lee; brother David Lee and wife Ethel  and their children and grandchildren; sister-in-  law Sarah Easley Drummond and her children  and grandchildren; and brother-in-law, Charles  Easley III and wife Claudia and their children;  we extend our deepest condolences.  Doug truly made an indelible mark on education in Florida and the United States. In our  community, he always stressed integrity, compassion and public service, and through that  principled dedication he  leaves a proud and  distinguished  legacy. Madam Speaker,  I ask  all Members of the U.S. House of Representatives  join me  in recognizing Dr. H. Douglas  Lee’s contributions to higher education and a  life commitment to making Stetson University  the great institution it is today.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 60TH  ANNIVERSARY OF CHRIST CHURCH  HON.

From humble beginnings  in 1950, Pastor  L.H. Hardwick has  led, nurtured, and grown  this fine congregation into one of Nashville’s  leading churches. With over 3500 members,  Christ Church impacts the entire Middle Tennessee region through its wide array of community involvement. One small example is the  church’s activity center, which includes fitness  facilities and an  indoor playground. Rather  than restricting access to the church’s members, the activity center is open to both friends  and neighbors to utilize.  I am awed by  the personal commitment  Pastor Hardwick has demonstrated  through  his service to Christ Church. When one considers the many changes that have occurred  in our country over the past sixty years, Pastor  Hardwick’s continuous service is real inspiration.  Please  join me  in honoring 60 years of  Christ Church’s past, and celebrating the next  60 years of Christ Church’s future.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  JAMES C. VAN ANTWERP, JR.  HON.

1465,113,2009-09-08,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, the city of  Mobile recently lost a dear friend, and I rise  today  to honor him and pay  tribute  to his  memory.  James Callanan Van Antwerp Jr. was a remarkable  businessman,  active  citizen  and  committed U.S. Naval officer. He will be remembered as a man devoted to his family, his  Catholic faith, his country and his community.  After graduating from Murphy High School  in 1940, Jim attended the U.S. Naval Academy and served in the Pacific, Far East, Atlantic and Mediterranean. He became an instructor at Auburn University’s Naval ROTC Unit  and then served as commander of the Naval  Reserve base in Mobile.  Jim worked as an  independent  insurance  agent before he began  running  the  family  business, Van Antwerp Realty Corp.,  in  the  1950s. He was active in the Mobile business  community, serving as a member of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce and as the  president of both the Mobile Real Estate Association and  the Mobile Association of  Independent Insurance Agents.  Jim also played an active role in city government. He served as director of the executive committee of Downtown Mobile Unlimited  and of the Mobile City Planning Commission.  He was also the former chairman of the First  Congressional District Committee and the Mobile Republican Executive Committee.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in remembering a dedicated and generous  community leader and a dear friend to many.  Mr. James Van Antwerp will be deeply missed  by his family—his wife, Margaret; his children,  James Callahan Van Antwerp  III, Elizabeth  Van Antwerp Reasonover, and John David  Van Antwerp; his brother, Daniel Janse Van  Antwerp; and his  seven grandchildren—as  well as his many friends and colleagues.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family  at this difficult time.  f  RECOGNIZING MATTHEW TRAVIS  TERRELL  HON.

1468,120,2009-09-08,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker,  it was  with deep sorrow and shock that I learned of  the death of Mr. Ken Bacon, President of Refugees  International. Ken was a great man,  who accomplished so much  in his  lifetime,  both inside and outside the U.S. government.  His wit, focus, passion and vision will be sorely missed by me and everyone who knew him.  One of the first actions I did with Ken in his  capacity as  the new president of Refugees  International was an event  in 2001 on  the  need  to ban anti-personnel  landmines. His  background and experience at the Pentagon  made Ken an especially authoritative voice in  support of the international treaty to ban landmines and on  the horror and humanitarian  consequences of  landmines.  I  found him  inspiring and energizing.  In  the years  to come, we would work  together on issues ranging from internally displaced people in Colombia, to the tragedy of  Darfur, and the need to ban the use of cluster  munitions. I last saw Ken at a breakfast on  Capitol Hill on June 17th, where we had a  chance to join forces once again to talk about  the special needs of displaced women and  girls.  Ken Bacon helped strengthen and revitalize  Refugees  International  into one of  the most  internationally  recognized voices and advocates on behalf of refugees and the internally  displaced. And like all his friends, family and  colleagues, I pledge to carry on his work as if  he were still right by my side.  I would like to insert into the RECORD the  statement on the death of Ken Bacon by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; the August 16th obituary in the New York Times; and  the August 15th  tribute posted by Refugees  International on its web site.  DEATHOFKENBACON, PRESIDENTOF  REFUGEESINTERNATIONAL  (HILLARYRODHAMCLINTON, AUG. 15, 2009)  The United States and the world lost a  great humanitarian leader with the passing  today of Ken Bacon, President of Refugees  International. Most Americans  remember  Ken as the unflappable civilian voice of the  Department of Defense, where he served with  distinction as spokesperson for many years.  But for millions of the world’s most vulnerable people—refugees and other victims of  conflict—Ken was an  invaluable source of  hope, inspiration and support. From Central  Africa to South Asia to the Americas, Ken  shone the spotlight on the causes of humanitarian suffering, and served as an  impassioned yet reasoned advocate for the principles of humanitarian protection and assistance. We will miss Ken, but we will be inspired by the contributions he has made and  the example he has set.  [From the New York Times, Aug. 16, 2009]  K. BACON, ANADVOCATEFORREFUGEES, IS  DEADAT64  (By Douglas Martin)  Kenneth H. Bacon, a former journalist and  Pentagon spokesman who devoted his last  years to highlighting refugees’ problems and  urging policymakers to find solutions, died  Saturday morning at his summer home on  Block Island, R.I. He was 64 and a resident of  Washington.  The cause was complications of melanoma,  his daughter Sarah said.  Mr. Bacon, as an assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, was the  spokesman for the Defense Department during NATO’s campaign to end the violence in  Kosovo in 1999. He then visited his first refugee camp during a trip to the Balkans with  William S. Cohen,  then  the defense  secretary.  ‘‘I had never seen refugees before, never  fully appreciated the sheer magnitude of one  million people leaving their homes and needing food, shelter and medical care and then  one million people going back home after the  war,’’ he said in an interview with The New  York Times in 2001.  ‘‘This  fascinated me,’’ he continued.  ‘‘I  knew it was rare for the world to help refugees so completely, and I wondered if somebody could help give the same attention to  the refugees in the Congo, Afghanistan and  Sudan.’’  Mr. Bacon became president of Refugees  International, which advocates  for assistance to save the lives of the world’s 41.9 million people who flee their homes to escape  violence, either in their own countries or  across borders. The organization also aids  the  12 million  stateless people  living  in  limbo without citizenship rights.  Refugees  International helps abandoned  refugees  receive  food, medicine and education; helps displaced  families to return  home and helps  stateless  families obtain  legal status. It also urges policymakers at  the national and international levels to send  peacekeepers to protect displaced people.  In a biography he wrote for the organization’s Web site, Mr. Bacon said the most important thing Refugees International does is  push governments and the United Nations to  overcome what he called the ‘‘commitment  gap’’ that prevents the world from ending  genocide, human rights abuses and wars.  Mr. Bacon wrote and spoke extensively  about these issues. In remarks at the Brookings Institution in February 2003, just five  weeks before  the United States attacked  Iraq, he suggested ways to reduce the number of refugees in a war, including choosing  targets outside of urban areas.  In an article in Newsday in September 2003  he urged  the United States  to persuade  France to contribute peacekeepers to Iraq,  because of France’s success in peacekeeping  elsewhere. At the time, many Americans resented France because of its strong opposition to the American attack.  Kenneth Hogate Bacon was born in Bronxville, N.Y., on Nov. 21, 1944. He graduated  from the Phillips Exeter Academy and Amherst College, where his father was a political science professor. He earned master’s degrees in journalism and business from Columbia.  In 1968 and 1969, he was a legislative assistant to United States Senator Thomas J.  McIntyre, Democrat of New Hampshire. He  then joined The Wall Street Journal’s Washington bureau, where he worked for 25 years  as a reporter, columnist and editor. From  1968 to 1974, he served in the Army Reserve.  Mr. Bacon had covered the Pentagon during the Carter administration and had come  to respect William J. Perry, a senior official.  When President Bill Clinton appointed Mr.  Perry as his second secretary of defense in  1994, Mr. Perry asked Mr. Bacon to be his  spokesman.  Mr. Bacon joined the Clinton administration as assistant to the secretary of defense  for public affairs, and was promoted to assistant secretary  in 1996. He served until  2001, becoming a familiar face on broadcast  and cable television news shows donned in  his signature bow tie.

1469,4,2009-09-15,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. STEARNS) for 5 minutes.  ,2009
1470,4,2009-09-15,Mr. STEARNS.," Madam Speaker, one  year ago yesterday, a major  investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared  bankruptcy, a move which sent the  Dow Jones tumbling 500 points and  simply  led to a chain of events  in  which the Federal Government nationalized AIG with a $189 billion bailout.  The American  auto  industry  asked  Congress to authorize help, hundreds of  billions of dollars, to bail out them.  Banks did the same thing. Private institutions across this country asked for  support.  Today, just 1 year later, our Federal  Government is in control of practically  every sector of our economy, having  spent almost $800 billion or 5 percent of  our GDP on a stimulus package that  was pork-laden and is still working to  create  jobs and boost this economy.  And, most  alarmingly, nothing has  been done to cure the culture of bailouts that our government, with the  help of the Federal Reserve, has continued  to  perpetuate. Bailout  after  bailout is not a strategy for economic  recovery.  My colleagues, we are at a critical  point in our Nation’s economic history.  Financial regulatory reform proposals  are being discussed here in Congress  and across this country. We all agree  that reform is certainly needed, but,  unfortunately, the plan put forth by  the Obama administration is not the  kind of reform that will put an end to  this culture of bailouts, nor will  it  bring transparency to the opaque and  ever, ever expanding Federal Reserve.  In fact, it does just the opposite.  In June of this year, Treasury Secretary Geithner unveiled the administration’s plan for financial regulatory  reform, and the cornerstone of the proposal is centered on ceding vast new  powers to the Federal Reserve as a  means of preventing  future  financial  crises. But this overreliance on the  Federal Reserve is unwise.  History shows us that in times the  Fed saved us from one crisis, it inadvertently  instigated another one.  In  1913 when the Fed was founded, it was  intentionally set up to serve as an institution that could help cushion the  blow when banking crises occurred.  However, the problem with an institution that is designed to insulate banks  from the consequences of their own  poor  investment decisions  is that  it  also  inadvertently  encourages  these  same banks  to keep  taking unwise  risks, thereby laying the groundwork  for a vicious cycle of bailout after bailout.  In fact, every time there is a potential financial crisis, the Federal Open  Market Committee quickly cuts short-  term interest rates. These cuts have  become larger over time, as evidenced  by our current zero percent interest  rates. And, more  importantly, these  cuts essentially function as a bailout  to those banks that have run into financial problems. Banks know  they  can count on the Fed to lower interest  rates during times of financial distress,  and markets know the Fed is always  prepared to provide loose credit to financiers facing big losses.  Now, what  lessons have the banks  learned from the financial crisis? The  truth is that if they get into trouble,  the Fed will be there to lend unlimited  amounts of money at extremely low interests rates. So where is the motivation then for curbing risky investment  behavioral by these banks? The only  one on the proverbial financial hook  under a current Federal bailout system  is you, the taxpayer.  Yesterday, President Obama gave a  speech on financial reform at Federal  Hall on Wall Street. Ironically, Federal  Hall is where the founders of our great  Nation once bitterly argued over how  much the government should control  the national economy.  In his speech, the President warned  Wall Street that they shouldn’t ignore  the lessons from the past financial and  current financial crisis. They shouldn’t  become complacent and expect future  bailouts. Yet the financial regulatory  reform, the plan the President’s administration is putting forth, calls for expanding the powers of the Federal Reserve, and the Fed is essentially a bailout machine for the financial sector.  Clearly there is a discrepancy between  the President’s rhetoric and the reality  of the policies.  In 55 B.C., the great Roman statesman Cicero wisely said, ‘‘The budget  should be balanced, the treasury should  be refilled, public debt should be reduced,  the arrogance of officialdom  should be tempered and controlled, and  assistance to foreign lands should be  curtailed,  lest Rome  become  bankrupt.’’  My colleagues, looking back on the  one-year anniversary of the Lehman  Brothers bankruptcy, we would do well  to heed Cicero’s advice and seek out financial reform policies that will steer  us away from the practice of bailouts  and the policies that will bankrupt future generations. My colleagues, America is too great a country to not learn  from its past mistakes.  f  RECESS  ",2009

1475,11,2009-09-15,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman for yielding. I want to also  thank the chairman and the ranking  member as well as the House leadership  for shepherding this bill to the floor.  This substitute amendment to H.R.  22 is sorely needed to partially relieve  the U.S. Postal Service of an oversize  payment of $5.4 billion to a Retiree  Health Benefits Fund. The postal service under this legislation will pay $1.4  billion.  The postal service  is suffering the  same effects of this recession as the  rest of the Nation. Without legislative  relief, the postal service will default on  a  $5.4 billion payment due on September 30.  This bill is not a bailout, as no taxpayer  funds will be provided to the  postal  service. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required  the postal service to prefund the cost  of health care benefits for future retirees. No other government agency or  private company is required to prefund  retiree benefits on such an aggressive  or ambitious schedule.  The postal service operates on revenues  from sales of  its products and  services. The postal service has already  embarked on cost-cutting estimated to  be $6 billion in fiscal year 2009, by cutting work hours, freezing hiring, and  closing administrative offices.  The postal service has paid $10 billion  into the trust  fund over the past 2  years, although it’s suffered combined  losses of $7.9 billion during that 2-year  period.  This bill is in line with the actions of  many large businesses, including their  competitors, which have temporarily  reduced or suspended payments for retiree benefits or pensions during the recession.  I  thank  the  for  chairman  Again,  yielding.  ",2009

1477,11,2009-09-15,Mr. CHAFFETZ.,"  I want  to  thank  Chairman TOWNSand I want to thank  Ranking Member ISSA for the bipartisan support and effort to move this  bill forward. It’s an important piece of  legislation.  H.R. 22 is needed to avoid a taxpayer-  funded bailout to the United States  Postal  Service. The United  States  Postal Service is the only Federal entity required to prefund its pension and  retiree health plans. H.R. 22 would enable the United States Postal Service  to use its existing revenues that have  been funded over the years through its  own  operations  to  pay  for  retiree  health benefits as opposed to using this  year’s operating revenues.  While the United States Postal Service needs to continue to reduce costs,  one of the impressive things that has  happened  is that they have reduced  their workforce by 22 percent since  1999, a 22 percent reduction in their  workforce since 1999, compared to a 13  percent increase in the Federal workforce in other parts of the government.  The main driver of the United States  Postal Service debt has been the 2006  Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act’s requirement to prefund 80  percent of its future retiree health benefit costs, a 75-year liability, in just 10  years. No other business or government  entity in the United States does that.  Had it not been for this prefunding, the  United States Postal Service would actually have shown a profit, and that’s  why I think you see broad bipartisan  support with 339 cosponsors on this bill  in support of H.R. 22.  I encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this so  that we can avoid a taxpayer bailout  that would be needed.  Finally, let me just mention the good  men and women who work so hard, so  diligently, that care so much. My hat’s  off to them for the good work that they  do  for this country and the United  States Postal Service.  ",2009
1478,11,2009-09-15,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Washington, D.C. (Ms. NORTON).  ",2009
1479,11,2009-09-15,Ms. NORTON.,"  I  rise with  great  thanks to our chairman and our ranking member, who worked so well together on this really essential bill.  Mr. Speaker, we have rescued a lot of  private sector agencies, a whole slew of  them. But here comes the postal service not asking for a bailout. Understand that we don’t even subsidize the  postal service, even though it is the  only Federal agency mentioned in the  Constitution. So it’s a Federal agency  we must have, mandated by the Constitution.  Yet alone among government agencies, if you want to consider an agency  that funds itself out of its own revenue  a government agency just because it’s  in the Constitution, alone the Postal  Service is required to prefund its retiree health benefits. Not us, mind you.  No Federal agency has got to do that.  And  how  does  the Postal  Service  prefund? From postal funds.  I don’t think you need to read the papers every day to know what has happened to postal funds. These folks have  had to put up $10 billion in prefunding  in the past couple of years out of postal  funds; yet this is a failing business. It’s  not a failing business because of its  policies or practices. The Postal Service has been overtaken by the  fax;  overtaken by emails.  They’re not like Wall Street, which  went into a deliberate mode of greed. I  don’t care what kind of genius you are,  you’re going to have a hard time if  you’re the postal service, which must  exist under our Constitution, to figure  out how you’re going to stay in business.  Yet in the past year alone, look at  the kind of hits this institution has  taken, not mandated by us: your mail  carrier, almost 11,500; rural carriers,  753 gone; mail handlers, 2,938 gone. In  the last 10 years, the postal service has  lost 175,000 employees. Show me a business that is left standing, having taken  those kinds of hits not because  it’s  overspending but for reasons, some of  which are beyond its control.  Now the chairman, the ranking member, the whole committee is on their  case  for even  further cuts, but the  American people are on our case to  make sure that their mail keeps being  delivered and that their trusted postal  worker is always there.  b1300  We shouldn’t ask more from the post  office in prefunding retiree benefits at  a time when I believe you could find  nobody  in the United States who  is  prefunding.  ",2009
1480,11,2009-09-15,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  1 minute.  I would like to comment on the Delegate’s statement because  it  is quite  true. Just in the last approximately 18  months, we have added almost 200,000  net Federal workers on the Federal  side. The post office is continuing to  reduce its workforce, anticipating reducing its workforce by about 30,000, or  more than 5 percent per year. We have  to do better.  I look forward to working with the  majority on finding ways that we can  integrate more postal workers  into  other Federal opportunities so we can  retain these good Federal servants, but  at the same time right-size the post office.  Having said that, it is very clear, as  Ms. NORTONsaid, that only the post office is really cutting itself in the Federal Government, and that is an unusual situation. They are right-sizing  themselves, and I hope all of our Members will be sensitive that we have to  right-size them at a rate that allows  our high quality service to continue.  ",2009

Livestock  is  an  important  value-  added industry that brings in millions  of dollars of revenue nationwide. Ensuring that producers have access to  cutting-edge products and information  to improve animal health is essential  to the continuing success of the livestock industry. Our entire Nation benefits from having the most competitive  livestock industry worldwide.  I encourage my colleagues to join me  in supporting H. Res. 317 to recognize  the Corridor’s outstanding  contribution to animal health.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  (Mr. HOLDEN)  for  his comments, and for the leadership of  our Committee on Agriculture, Mr. PETERSONand Mr. LUCAS, for their support of this resolution, H. Res. 317.  We consider this resolution today,  which recognizes the region between  Manhattan, Kansas,  and  Columbia,  Missouri, a great opportunity for two  States that are often rivals, to come  together in recognition of the Kansas  City Animal Health Corridor.  This area of Kansas and Missouri has  long  been  considered  our  country’s  headquarters  for  animal  and  bioscience. The largest concentration of  animal health and nutrition interests  in the Nation is located in this corridor, including more than 120 companies that account for nearly $17 billion  in global sales. This amounts to over  one-third of the total sales in the animal health industry.  Part  of what makes  this  region  unique  is  its  location  in one of the  largest livestock-producing regions in  the country. My own congressional district is the largest livestock-producing  district in the Nation. The Kansas City  Animal Health Corridor is a benefit to  livestock producers in our region and  to the country, and to the employment  and investments these producers contribute to the local economy.  Biosciences are a tremendous opportunity for our State and its citizens. As  the national economy has struggled,  the animal health industry continues  to expand and experience growth. The  businesses, universities, and other interests located in the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor provide an opportunity for our best and brightest young  people to stay and work in Kansas and  Missouri, the Midwest.  Earlier this year, the Department of  Homeland Security named this world-  renowned area for animal health research as the home of the National Bio  and Agro-Defense Facility, NBAF. This  Federal laboratory is urgently needed  to develop the vaccines and countermeasures against the threat of foreign  animal disease, protecting our  food  supply and our economy. The Kansas  City Animal Health Corridor will provide the workforce expertise and the  collaboration opportunities  to make  NBAF a great success.  I appreciate the House of Representatives recognizing the important role of  this region to furthering animal health  and nutrition across the Nation and  the globe. By supporting this resolution, we are helping to foster support  for crucial research and business development  in  the  animal  health  and  science area.  I urge my colleagues and Members to  support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  b1345  ",2009

1488,18,2009-09-15,Mr. STUPAK.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 317 designates  the region from Manhattan, Kansas, to  Columbia, Missouri, as the Kansas City  Animal Health Corridor. Manhattan,  Kansas, is slated to become the new  home of the foot-and-mouth research  in the United States as part of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility,  NBAF as it’s called. This is where my  problem is with this resolution.  Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly  contagious animal disease,  infecting  nearly 100 percent of the animals exposed to the virus. There have been two  outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in  the United Kingdom this decade. The  first resulted in the slaughter of more  than 6 million animals, and it cost that  country more than $16 billion. The second outbreak is suspected to have come  from an accidental release from a government  lab. It  is estimated that a  foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the  United States could cost as much as $40  billion, and it would devastate the U.S.  livestock market.  For more than 50 years, research on  foot-and-mouth disease in the United  States has been done off Plum Island,  which is off the coast of New York’s  Long Island. The natural water barrier  protects our animal population from an  accidental or intentional release of the  disease from the island research facility.  House Resolution 317 states:  ‘‘More  than 45 percent of the fed cattle—40  percent of the hogs and 20 percent of  beef cows and calves produced in the  United States—are located within 350  miles of Kansas City.’’  I am baffled as to why we would want  to move the foot-and-mouth disease research into the heart of Kansas given  these staggering statistics. An accidental or an intentional release of foot-  and-mouth disease  in this enormous  beef and pork population would bring  our livestock industry to its knees.  As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee,  I held a  hearing  in the  last Congress on the  Bush  administration’s  ill-conceived  plan to move foot-and-mouth research  off of Plum Island and onto the mainland of the United States.  In response to my subcommittee’s  hearing, Congress required the Department of Homeland Security to conduct  a study to determine if foot-and-mouth  disease can be done safely on the mainland. DHS’s study was then to be evaluated  by  the Government Accountability  Office,  GAO.

1509,39,2009-09-15,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the leader.  Mr. Speaker, I am having some difficulty understanding how it is that we  are on the floor today debating this  resolution. I would like to first speak  to the claims made by my colleague on  the other side of the aisle, the majority  whip, in pointing out what are alleged  to be precedents for this resolution.  As he knows, those instances that he  referred  to, whether  it be  the gentleman from California (Mr. STARK) or  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  Thomas) when they came to the well of  this body to speak to our colleagues, it  was as a result of conduct displayed,  number one, in the case of Mr. STARK,  during debate on  the  floor of  this  House, and number two, on the part of  Mr. Thomas, conduct that took place  among members  in a committee on  which I sit, the Ways and Means, two  very distinct situations from the one  we have here at hand.  Again, I don’t understand how it is a  priority that we are here on this particular resolution. The resolution, as  has been pointed out, creates no job.  The resolution does nothing to do anything  to  increase access  to quality  health care. The resolution does nothing to address the issues of national security. Plain and simple, this resolution does not reflect the priority of the  American people.  Now, President Obama came to this  Chamber last week and he admonished  us, Mr. Speaker. He admonished us to  stop with the partisan bickering. In  fact, he echoed the sentiments that he  expressed during his inaugural address  when he said, ‘‘We may still be a young  Nation, but  it  is time to set aside  childish things.’’  Now, as the leader said, as the gentleman  from South Carolina himself  said, he admits that what he did was  inappropriate. He was on national television  indicating he  shouldn’t have  done it. He wouldn’t do it again. He  also said to the Nation, he called the  President. As the leader indicated, the  President graciously accepted the apology. I am told the Vice President has  also accepted the apology. What more  does the gentleman want? That’s why I  am at a loss as to what this is if it is  not a partisan stunt.  So I believe we ought to accept what  the President and the Speaker and others have said: Let’s get on with the  business of the people. Let’s try and  get over the divide and stick to the  course of trying to work on things we  agree on, or things that we have a potential to do away with the disagreements, not the partisanship.  Now, this  is the bill. This  is the  famed H.R.  3200, Mr. Speaker,  and  there are several  issues  in here the  American people have spoken out on.  The first is the claim that we ought to  be able to keep what we have if we are  talking about health  insurance. On  page 16 of the bill, there is a section entitled, ‘‘Protecting the Choice to Keep  Current Coverage.’’ That’s what we all  are trying to do for the 85 or some percent of this country who has health insurance.  You know what, our side says despite  that title, there are provisions in there  which begin to require individuals and  their  insurers  to do  certain  things  which make it somewhat difficult if  not  impossible to allow  for  folks to  keep what they have.  The next issue that is of import certainly to the American people and to  this body is the question of access to  Federal benefits by those who are here  illegally.  Now,  the President  stood on  this  floor in this body, Mr. Speaker, and  said that he did not believe that there  was any access for those here illegally  to Federal benefits. In fact, on page  143, there is a section which speaks to  the issue that there should be no Federal benefit for those here illegally.  The problem that we have on this  side is there is no requirement of verification of legal status. And in fact the  White House, in fact Senator BAUCUS  and others have since come out and  said, You know what, you’re  right.  These are the kinds of things we could  be doing right now to try and accomplish what it is that the American people have sent us here to do, and they  expect us to do that in a deliberate  manner that produces a positive result,  which means we all have got to do that  living within our means and to ensure  that we do not break the bank in passing this health care reform measure.  b1645  So I implore this House, Mr. Speaker,  let’s try and get back to the business of  the people.

Congressman JOE  WILSONadmitted himself that his actions were wrong and that he shouldn’t  have done it and that he won’t do it  again. Mr. Wilson apologized to the  President, and that was the right thing  to do.  Mr. Speaker, how much longer does  this go on? What are we really accomplishing here today? The President accepted Mr. WILSON’s apology. Both the  President and Mr. WILSONagreed it was  time to move on. Just late last week,  the Speaker of this House said, ‘‘It’s  time for us to talk about health care  and not ",2009
1513,39,2009-09-15,Mr. WILSON.,"’’ I couldn’t agree  more.

Just last  week, we were told, Let’s put aside the  partisan bickering.  Instead of pursuing this petty partisanship, now is the time to work together on behalf of the American people. Hardworking families back home  are  worried  about  the  economy.  They’re worried  about  losing  their  jobs. Hardworking American  families  all across this country want us to stop  a government takeover of health care.  Let’s stop wasting time.

1516,46,2009-09-15,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, over  the past  several  years we repeatedly hear politicians  during debate using increasingly harsh  words. Verbal attacks are  rewarded  with sound bites on the evening news  and a bump in polling numbers, public  profile, and  fund-raising. Then  like  Pavlov’s dog, we salivate at the next  opportunity for a verbal attack. But to  what end?  If there is anywhere that decorum in  debate has a place, it is in the Chamber  of the House of Representatives, with  respectful discourse. When we  focus  only on the anger, we lose legitimacy  as  thoughtful  legislators. We  are  tasked with maintaining a standard of  cooperation and civility rather than insult and hostility. Both sides, both parties, all of us, must focus on changing  for the better and set the example for  our country, for the public, and for our  people.  During  this  session  of  Congress  alone, over a dozen resolutions have  been brought up to attack, embarrass,  and deride Members of Congress. In the  meantime our Nation is faced with unemployment in record numbers, an ailing stock market, a health care crisis,  growing debt, and two wars. That is the  work of Congress. That  is what the  American people want us to address.  Anything less is unacceptable. Period.  Let’s all stop the name-calling and  shouting. We’ve got work to do.  f  RECOGNIZING CHILDREN’S  HOSPITAL OF MINNESOTA  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
1517,46,2009-09-15,Mr. PAULSEN.," Mr. Speaker, as part  of Children’s Cancer Awareness Month,  I rise to call attention to the innovative work of Children’s Hospitals and  Clinics of Minnesota.  Each year in the United States, there  are approximately 12,400 children who  will develop cancer before their 20th  birthday. Children’s Hospital is helping  to combat cancer by embracing a simple motto: ‘‘better journey, better outcomes.’’ They believe that the more  you can help a child by simply being a  kid during treatment, the more likely  the cancer will be defeated.  Children’s Integrative Medicine Program treats children dealing with all  types of illnesses and injuries, bringing  together the best therapies to help kids  and their families. Most importantly,  Children’s gets  results. Their  treatment results are consistently among  the best in the Nation.  Finding out a child has cancer is a  terrifying moment for any family. I am  proud to recognize that an institution  that is working so hard to bring new  approaches and a unique philosophy to  families facing this terrible disease is  successful in helping children get back  to living their lives cancer-free.  f  TIME TO GET DOWN TO THE  BUSINESS OF CONGRESS  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

1523,46,2009-09-15,Mr. POE  of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  America needs to do a better job of protecting our borders. It is the job of the  Federal Government to do so. And the  Federal Government must do a better  job of keeping criminals out in the first  place.  The Federal Government needs  to  make sure we deport foreign nationals  after they have served their time and  after they’ve been convicted in American prisons.  But there is a problem and let me explain. Right now foreign nationals who  commit serious crimes in our country  and are convicted and go to our prisons, while they are in prison, they are  lawfully deported by our immigration  judges. That’s a good thing. And after  they have served their time, of course,  it’s time for them to go back to where  they came from.  But right now there are several countries that won’t take back  lawfully  convicted  foreign  nationals.  Those  countries  are  Vietnam,  Jamaica,  China, India, Ethiopia, Laos, and Iran.  These countries won’t take back their  convicted criminals. These individuals  are really people without a country. So  what happens to them? Because they  have served their time in our Federal  and State prisons for felonies, they are  actually released back into our communities. They are people without a  country.  Right now there are over 160,000 of  these criminal aliens roaming our Nation and our streets. These people have  been  lawfully deported after they’ve  served  their prison  time, but  their  home nation  refuses  to  take  them  back.  So I am introducing legislation that  will plug up this loophole. My bill will  make it a lot more likely they will go  back where they came from. This bill  says that any country who won’t take  back lawfully convicted foreign nationals who have been deported will lose  foreign aid. But China,  for example,  doesn’t receive foreign aid; so what will  happen to China is they will not receive legal visas for their citizens to  come into the United States.  b1815  No more student visas for China if  they won’t take back their convicted  criminals  that have  been  deported.  None whatsoever.  The current law says the State Department may deny visas under these  circumstances, but the State Department seems to refuse to send individuals back to their lawfully deported  countries because, I guess, China, for  example, is a trading partner and they  don’t want  to hurt  the  feelings of  China.  My bill won’t allow the State Department to ignore that portion of the law.  Therefore, it will be mandatory. If they  refuse to take back convicted foreign  nationals, that nation will  lose the  right to come here legally. We need to  make sure that these individuals don’t  come here in the first place, especially  the criminal element. All sorts of dangerous things are coming across our  wide-open borders. The possibilities are  endless for what could be just walking  across our southern border.  We know about the human and sex  trafficking, the drugs, the guns, the  dirty money and the like. But what  about chemical and biological or nuclear materials? Do we know?

1524,53,2009-09-15,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," My friend, Mr.  YARMUTH, mentioned Medicare,  and  one thing where there has been another  myth is that there were going to be  cuts in Medicare or things like that. In  fact, it’s just the opposite.  There are additional benefits, and  one of the benefits that is very important, I know, to my district, and certainly when I was out talking to people, was getting rid of the doughnut  hole in prescription drug costs. So that  if you get to a certain level, all of a  sudden, instead of the Medicare benefit  paying for it, now you have got to pay  for it out of your pocket.  And many people run into this, and it  is  financially  just difficult and,  in  some cases, devastating to them because of this doughnut hole. And this  bill, part of  it  is to eliminate this  doughnut hole  so  that  the benefits  cover prescription medicines.  I think the bottom line for me here is  that the status quo is not an option,  that there has to be real change to the  way this system operates, for individuals who are discriminated against because of their physical health and conditions to small businesses who see the  costs going through the roof, and to  the Nation that sees its costs going  through the roof.  We can’t stand  idly by. We can’t  allow failure to reign. We must act.  And it’s a difficult subject. It’s a very  complicated system, and it touches 300  million people across this country, so  everybody has a perspective on it.  But looking at it in the whole and  trying to deal with it as a whole, we  must make changes. And that’s what I  hope will occur over  the next  few  months here  in  this House of Representatives and in the Senate and ultimately signed by the President so  that we can get on with this and start  making the changes that are so desperately needed before the system continues to get worse, premiums continue  to go higher, people who shouldn’t be  discriminated against are.  We need change, and I am ready for it  now.  ",2009
1525,53,2009-09-15,Mr. YARMUTH.," It’s important to reemphasize  the  point  that  Mr.  PERLMUTTERjust made was that this is  an  incredibly  complicated  endeavor.  And that’s one of the problems we have  in terms of a communications effort,  that there are so many things that  need to be explained. And as I have described it before, this is the biggest  Rubik’s Cube  that anyone has ever  tried to solve because there are so  many moving parts.  And one of the things that I have  heard from a number of people in my  district is they say, well, why don’t  you do it piece by piece? Why don’t you  do it incrementally? And the answer is,  of course, that because of the system  we have in this country, you can’t really approach this problem piecemeal,  because you could say, for instance, we  are going to address the problems in  Medicare. You could do that, or you  could say we are going to address the  private insurance system. The problem  is that they use the same provider networks. The same doctors service the  private system and the public system,  Medicare, Medicaid. The  same hospitals service them, the same home  health  care  companies,  the  same  skilled nursing facilities service both.  So there  is so much cost shifting  going on,  so  that because Medicare  pays less to providers, they charge private insurance companies more, which  drives rates up. And they are always  trying to balance their overall business  to provider networks with the compensation they get, a reimbursement  from both sides. So unless you deal  with it holistically, you are going to  basically push the finger in one side of  the balloon and push it out the other  end. We know that game.  And  so  incrementalism, while  it  might be desirable, it might be easier  to achieve a comfort level in the country because people might be able to digest what we are proposing to do a little bit better, the fact is that reform  that doesn’t touch all of these areas is  not going to be effective, and we will  just distort the system even more and  probably have more and more people  fall through the cracks.  So nobody said this was going to be  easy. I think it was Teddy Roosevelt  100 years ago who talked about providing universal health care, and we  are still struggling with a way to bring  health care to all our citizens. But we  can do it. It’s important work. I don’t  think there is anything we will ever do  in this body at least domestically that  will be as important as this effort.  And as I look around the world and  see what other countries have done, see  both the positive aspects of many other  systems, some of the negatives, again,  I don’t think there is anywhere else in  the world where I would say we can  take that system and plop it down in  the United States and it would be the  perfect system for us.  There are elements of everybody’s  system around the world that could be  useful in, again, creating that uniquely  American solution.

I have  trouble comprehending people not letting us finish these bills and then complaining that we have to do a continuing resolution to fund the government.  That is where we are. I hope we can  have cooperation. I hope we do not  have to  file cloture on this bill. It  would seem to be so unnecessary. Remember, I repeat, she was here Thursday, Friday, and Monday.

There will be no rollcall  votes after 3 p.m. today.  Mr. President, I had a meeting with  Senator MCCONNELL. We try to get together personally every week. It is nice  that we have a chance to visit privately. But also we talked about what  the schedule is going to be. We have a  lot to do. I went over that in some detail with the Republican  leader. We  have now scheduled a work period at  home on Columbus Day week. We have  many times in the past taken that recess because there is so much work to  do at home. But we cannot do that unless we complete our work here. I have  explained that to the Republican leader, and he knows that. We will see what  progress we can make in the next few  weeks as to whether we can do that.  I will not go into detail about all the  work we have to do, but we are on a fiscal year basis. That fiscal year ends at  the end of September. We are in September now. We have a lot of must-do  legislation we have to move forward on  as quickly as we can.

1535,74,2009-09-15,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I have  decided to come to the Chamber in my  capacity as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee to  address a number of Coburn amendments that he has either laid down or  intends to lay down, and I hope we can  work to defeat these amendments, as I  understand them, and I want to say  why.  We have a very important relationship with our States when it comes to  transportation and highway programs,  and we work with them on many aspects of transportation. We have something called  the Transportation Enhancement Program. It is a TE program. It was created  in 1991  in the  ISTEA bill, and one of the purposes  was to encourage investments in many  areas  that have been overlooked.  I  want to give you an example of those.  Since 1992, because of this TE Program, over $11.5 billion has been made  available to the States for some very  important purposes that deal with safety, that deal with making sure our  highways are kept in a condition we  want to see them kept. I will give more  examples of the funding. But over that  period of time, that $11.5 billion has  created  399,000  jobs. Let me  repeat  that. This  special program Senator  COBURNwants to strip—and he wants  to strip parts of it—is responsible for  399,000 jobs since 1992. I am here to  say—because I know my friend, Senator MURRAY, agrees with me—of all  the times not to visit more job losses  on our people, it certainly is now. Jobs  are key, and the Coburn amendment is  a jobs killer.  Let me tell you about the various  areas that fall under this program he is  taking the ax to.  Environmental mitigation. This includes projects that address water pollution due to highway runoff. We just  read a  front-page story  in the New  York Times where we  see  terrible  water pollution affecting our children.  They had a picture of a child who has  been drinking water that really has not  been tested in the right way according  to the law. This child’s teeth all have  to be capped because his teeth rotted.  So we want to make sure we do not let  that runoff get into waterways.  Also, we hear about wildlife mortality. Anyone who has seen the result  of a crash between a car and, let’s say,  a deer on a road knows this is a horrific situation for all parties, and it is  a matter of life or death for drivers and  their passengers. That is what some of  this money is used for and that is what  our friend, Senator COBURN, wants to  take the ax to, as far as I understand  it.  Then there are facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists and safety and  educational activities for pedestrians.  Residents of my State are strong supporters  of  spending  transportation  funds on bicycle paths and pedestrian  facilities. We all know walking and  biking  are  forms  of  transportation  which should not be cut but, rather, encouraged.  Other categories of TE, the transportation enhancements, that it is my understanding Senator COBURNwants to  cut: acquisition of scenic easements  and scenic history sites, including historic battlefield sites. Does he think  that little of the history of the country  that he wants to take an ax to this,  scenic or historic highway programs,  including the provision of tourist and  welcome center facilities? Again, tourism is one of the things we need to  build up. There are many millions of  jobs related to tourism, landscaping,  and other scenic beautification. We all  know and take pride in our communities. Highway beautification, to me,  is a key part of our quality of life—historic preservation, rehabilitation, and  operation  of historic  transportation  buildings.  We have seen some of those. We have  seen them in places as far flung as New  York to places in St. Louis, MO, to San  Francisco, CA—preservation of abandoned railway cars, including conservation and use of the cars for pedestrian  or bike trails; inventory control and  removal of outdoor advertising and archeological  planning  and  research.  Senator COBURNwould have us believe  that transportation enhancements are  a  low-priority project. These are  investments that put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work. These are  investments that improve safety, prevent pollution, save fuel, and improve  the quality of life for millions of Americans.  I wonder if Senator MURRAY and I  can engage for a minute here through  the Chair.  What  is the timing of when these  amendments will be voted on? Can the  chairman tell me?  ",2009
1536,74,2009-09-15,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, in response to the Senator from California,  the Senator from Oklahoma has offered  a number of amendments. We are hoping to debate them this afternoon and  vote on them tomorrow morning.  ",2009

1546,102,2009-09-15,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to introduce with my colleague  from Vermont, Senator LEAHY,  the  Satellite  Television  Modernization  Act. I also note the efforts of Senators  in crafting  SESSIONS, KOHL, and KYL this bipartisan bill.  It is hard to believe that 5 years have  transpired since we passed the Satellite  Home Viewer Extension Act, SHVERA,  of 2004. Much has occurred since that  time,  including  the  transition  from  analog to digital signals, which occurred in June. That is why the proposed legislation will not only reauthorize the statutory license used by  satellite television providers, but will  bring all of the statutory licenses into  the digital age so that consumers can  receive a good quality digital signal.  Additionally, S. 1670 expands access to  low power stations by broadening the  license for low power stations to cover  the entire local market; permits satellite providers to carry a noncommercial educational broadcast station if a  station is part of a state-wide network;  improves the ability of both DirecTV  and DISH Network to provide local signals to local markets; and addresses  the ‘‘phantom signal’’ issue, where currently cable providers may be required  to pay royalty fees under section 111  based on subscribers who do not receive  the content for which the royalty is  being paid.  I hasten to point out, however, that  much more needs to be done to move  away from government regulation and  toward a marketplace where satellite  providers and cable providers can compete based on market forces. This is  not a new issue for this body. In fact,  during  the  2004  reauthorization  of  SHVERA, Congress required that the  U.S. Copyright Office prepare a report  to make recommendations on the operations of, and revisions to, sections 111,  119, and 122 of the Copyright Act. The  Copyright Office provided this report  to Congress on June 30, 2008.  While I will not provide a line by line  summary of the Report, I will underscore some key findings that the Copyright Office, under the  leadership of  Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters, suggests that Congress consider  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:36 Sep 16, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15SE6.028 S15SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

Borlaug—the Father of  ‘‘Green Revolution.’’  Dr. Norman Borlaug applied scientific innovation,  compassion  for  the poor and expert  knowledge of agricultural practices to develop  and  introduce  groundbreaking  technologies  that will forever change the prospects of the  hungry and impoverished around the globe.  Borlaug’s development of high-yield and disease-resistant wheat varieties bore results in  Mexico, Pakistan and India that stretched the  imagination of viable agriculture in developing  countries. Recently, Borlaug worked to apply  farming practices and methods of increasing  food production  to Asia and Africa and has  continued  to  advocate  the  use  of  biotechnology to combat world famine.  World  leaders will honor and continue his  legacy by  further applying his practices and  technologies  to  future agriculture and  food  production.

1548,116,2009-09-15,Mr. ISSA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay  tribute  to an  individual who  selflessly risked his life to save the life of a  terribly injured Marine, former Staff Sergeant  Irving Saunders. Our country has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated Marines  who willingly and unselfishly risk their lives to  keep our country safe.  We recognize Vernon R. Buss for his meritorious actions on the Guiana Airstrip, Samar  Island, Republic of the Philippines on the 24  January 1945, while  serving as a ground  maintenance mechanic, aircraft wing. On this  day while performing maintenance duties  in  connection with operation against Japanese  forces  in  the Philippines, Corporal Vernon  Robert Buss, United States Marine, put the life  of another Marine over his own. While assisting in the rescue attempt of a crashed aircraft  and  its crew, Corporal Buss singlehandedly  extracted the unconscious and burning body  of Staff Sergeant  Irving Saunders  from  the  wreckage of a burning F4–U Corsair. With  total disregard  for his own safety, Corporal  Buss rushed to the side of Staff Sergeant Irving Saunders and carried him away from the  burning aircraft, the burning pools of gasoline,  and the random detonation of .50 caliber ammunition as it ‘‘cooked off’’ from the Corsair’s  burning ammunition  supply. Corporal Buss  carried Staff Sergeant Saunders to safety, rendered first aid to him, and facilitated his evacuation to a hospital where he was treated for  life threatening third degree burns over an estimated forty percent of his body. We recognize Corporal Vernon Robert Buss for his fearless personal initiative, professional dedication  and sagacious bravery on 24 January 1945.  His actions reflect the meritorious credit upon  his person and were in keeping with the highest  traditions of  the Marine Corps and  the  United States Naval Service.  On behalf of  the people of  the United  States, Congressman DARRELLE. ISSA, Major  General Michael R.  Lehnert, Commanding  General Marine Corps Installations West, and  all veterans who have served with courage  and honor, we commemorate your service.  f  CONGRATULATING DAVID CAREY,  RECIPIENT OF ROBERT WOODS  JOHNSON  COMMUNITY  LEADER  AWARD  HON.

1549,116,2009-09-15,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to congratulate David Carey on being  honored with  the Robert Woods  Johnson  Community Leader Award. David is currently  the Human Services Co-op Board Chair of Inspire, an organization that aims to empower  individuals with disabilities to direct and control  their own services  in a way  that promotes  community life.  David’s  journey  began  in  1988.  One  evening, as his roommate and a friend were  examining a gun, it went off, shooting a bullet  into his spine as he slept. In just moments, he  went  from dreaming of becoming a professional baseball player to facing the rest of his  life with  quadriplegia. While  this  sudden  change of circumstance would deter many  people, David redirected his energy  to help  other people with disabilities.  Today, David’s leadership impacts the lives  of over 500,000 people with disabilities in the  Phoenix area. Since 2006, when he  led a  group of  individuals  to create  Inspire, David  has secured long term contracts to provide attendant care services and ensure that individuals across Arizona receive the quality of care  they deserve. He has also worked with local  transit authorities to create accessible public  transportation  throughout  the Valley of  the  Sun.  When  I was an Arizona State Senator,  David would come  to my office  to  lobby on  disability issues. It did not make any difference  how hot it was outside; David put in the effort  and make his way to the State Capitol, usually  on public transportation. I was impressed with  him then, and continue to be impressed with  his accomplishments now.  The Robert Woods  Johnson Foundation  Community Health  Leaders  program  each  year honors 10 outstanding and otherwise unrecognized individuals who overcome daunting  odds to improve health and health care, especially  to underserved populations  in communities across the United States. The program  elevates the work of these unsung heroes, like  David,  through enhanced  recognition,  technical assistance and new leadership opportunities. I know he will use these new resources  to improve the lives of Arizonans with disabilities.  Madam Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating David Carey on being honored with  the Robert Woods Johnson Community Leader Award. His dedication  to creating better  communities is an example for us all.  f  RECOGNIZING 75TH ANNIVERSARY  OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. MARK E. SOUDER  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 9, 2009  ",2009
1550,116,2009-09-15,Mr. SOUDER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in support of H. Res 556 recognizing the 75th  Anniversary of  the Federal Credit Union Act  and to acknowledge the great work of credit  unions  throughout  the Third Congressional  District.  Indiana has a long history with credit unions  and in fact, was the first Midwestern state to  pass a law permitting their founding. In October of 1923, the first credit union in the Midwest opened its doors in Indiana. Today there  are 206 credit unions throughout my state that  count over 2 million Indiana residents among  its members.  The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 was  originally passed, in part, to help make credit  available to underserved communities. These  financial cooperatives were organized by people primarily tied together by some common  bond. Today, credit unions continue to provide  unique services  to both  their members and  communities.  The Chiphone Federal Credit Union of Elkhart, IN has been providing service since 1947  and  today has over 17,000 members. They  have strong  ties  to  the community and  received honorable mention  from  the  Indiana  Credit Union League in both the Dora Maxwell  Awards and Louise Herring Awards which recognize outstanding efforts in social responsibility and community service and  the credit  union that best puts the credit union philosophy in action respectively.  In Auburn Indiana, DeKalb Financial Credit  Union provides both superior financial service  and to support local charities through service  activities and donations.

1551,123,2009-09-15,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to remember Patrick Swayze, actor and  advocate. Swayze died at the age of 57—yesterday—September 14, 2009 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was born  in  Houston, Texas, on August 18, 1952 to parents,  dancer  and  choreographer  Patsy  Swayze, and  the  late engineer draftsman,  Jesse Swayze.  A great actor, singer and dancer and an  outstanding native Texan, Swayze had a long  and distinguished career  that made him an  American icon. Known for his work in many  films including ‘‘The Outsiders’’, ‘‘Dirty Dancing’’, and  ‘‘Roadhouse,’’ Swayze has been  gracing the big screen for over four decades.  He received  four Golden Globe nominations  for his performances  in  ‘‘Ghost’’ and  ‘‘To  Wong  Foo,  Thanks  for  Everything!  Julie  Newmar’’.  Patrick Swayze had been suffering  from  pancreatic cancer since January 2008. Despite his own  illness, Swayze’s unwavering  dedication to bring awareness and fight cancer  remained clear until his final days. He recently  wrote a letter to Congress asking for support  and funding towards the National Institutes of  Health for treating cancer as well as other life  threatening  illnesses. Swayze brought necessary attention to pancreatic cancer by making fellow Americans aware that ‘‘more than  1.4 million will be diagnosed with cancer  in  their lifetimes,’’ and reminding them ‘‘that they  are not alone.’’  Patrick’s rise to fame began at Waltrip High  School  in Houston. After graduation, he enrolled in San Jacinto College, located in the  second district of Texas,  to  focus on gymnastics. His training allowed him to take his  first step  toward stardom as Snow White’s  Prince Charming with the Disney’s Parade Ice  Show. Shortly after, he traveled to New York  City in order to pursue his first love, dancing.  However, an old football injury ended his ballet career, directing Swayze  towards acting.  Swayze starred in over 33 movies, 7 theatre  productions,  and  had  numerous  television  roles and appearances throughout his accomplished career.  Swayze leaves behind his wife of over thirty  years, Lisa Niemi. Together they weathered a  journey of both success and disappointment.  Swayze and Niemi’s love and commitment for  one another was unwavering until  the very  end.  On behalf of the second congressional district of Texas, I rise to remember a true native  Texan, Patrick Swayze  for his outstanding  achievements  in  the entertainment business  and in the fight against cancer. His life is truly  an example to all. He will be remembered as  a role model and a shining example of hard  work, determination, and the spirit of Texas.  f  HONORING MR. WILEY HILBURN  HON. RODNEY ALEXANDER  OFLOUISIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 15, 2009  ",2009
1552,123,2009-09-15,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Madam Speaker,  it  is  with great pride that I rise today to commend  Mr. Wiley Hilburn, an esteemed editor,  respected mentor and prolific columnist.  On September 1, the Louisiana Tech University news bureau chief, journalism teacher  and department head, will retire after 41 years  of dedication and service. Hilburn’s legacy is  not only embedded  in his written work, but  translated into the countless careers of past  students.  The Tech Talk, Louisiana Tech’s weekly  newspaper, was not always the student voice  of the university, but merely a mouthpiece for  the administration.  In 1968, Tech President  F.J.  Taylor,  hired Hilburn  to  liberate  the  school’s newspaper, a period consumed with  controversy and fueled by opinion. Successfully  safeguarding  the  student body’s First  Amendment right during the Vietnam War and  Civil Rights movement renders recognition.  Hilburn will retire  from one of Louisiana’s  most acclaimed journalism schools. During his  41-year-tenure, Hilburn served under Taylor  and  current Tech President Dan Reneau.  Throughout the past 40 years, students have  learned how to report responsibly and objectively.  Although he will no longer steer the student  voice of Tech, his opinionated outlook of reason will continue in his columns, printed weekly  in The Shreveport Times and The News-  Star, of Monroe.  The Ouachita River touches most parishes  in North Louisiana; Hilburn touches the hearts  of all of his readers in North Louisiana every  Sunday. During his four decades of teaching  and mentoring students, Hilburn gave  ‘fragments’ of his life to every journalism student  who walked through Keeney Hall.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Wiley Hilburn, a teacher, writer and  personal friend.

1559,5,2009-09-24,Ms. MATSUI.,"  I yield myself  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 3631, the Medicare Premium Fairness Act, under suspension of the rules. It allows this body  to consider time-sensitive  legislation  under an expedited process to shield  millions of Medicare beneficiaries from  harmful  premium  increases  for  the  coming year.  Due to the struggles facing our economy today, many seniors will not receive Social Security COLAs this year,  even though the Medicare part B premiums will still rise. The Medicare  Premium Fairness Act addresses this  problem by protecting Medicare beneficiaries from bearing the burden of increased premiums because of an economic  downturn  largely  outside  of  their control. And it does so without  adding to the deficit.  Without today’s bill, seniors who are  new to the Medicare program will see  their monthly premiums  jump dramatically. Other part B recipients will  shoulder an unfairly large share of cost  increases because of the way current  law requires part B to be funded. Cash-  strapped States will be forced to bear  the burden of higher Medicare costs for  dual-eligible beneficiaries.  For these reasons, I believe my colleagues will agree with me that inaction is not an option here today. As our  country begins to climb back out of  one of the largest recessions in recent  memory, now is the worst possible moment to saddle our seniors with  increased premiums.  Many respected outside groups agree  with this statement and have endorsed  the Medicare Premium Fairness Act.  AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,  the Center for Medicare Advocacy, and  the Alliance  for Retired Americans  have all endorsed H.R. 3631.  These groups understand that we’re  living through a time when rising costs  have threatened the health care people  in this country have and deserve. This  is true for Medicare beneficiaries and  non-beneficiaries alike.  For this reason, making health care  more affordable for all Americans is  our top priority. And protecting and  strengthening Medicare is an essential  part of this vision.  I urge my colleagues to support today’s rule and the  underlying bill so that beneficiaries  can continue to see their doctors; so  that they can continue to afford their  prescriptions, especially medications;  so  that  they can continue  to have  money to spend and cycle back through  our recovering economy.  By acting quickly and decisively on  today’s bill, we underscore our commitment to preserve Medicare for millions of people who have earned the security it represents and who count on  the stability and the dignity it provides. In doing so, we will keep our collective promise to stand with America’s seniors as they age and to ensure  they have the health care they need to  live long and fruitful lives.  We must never forget that Medicare  is an essential part of our country’s social contract. It guarantees that America’s seniors will not be forced to fend  for themselves when the economy momentarily turns sour or when they get  sick or as they age. This is the living  legacy of the Medicare program, and it  is a legacy we build upon today.  But we do not have much time to act,  Mr. Speaker. We must pass this legislation before October 1. This is so that  the Social Security Administration  can program updated premiums into a  system in time to ensure that Medicare  premium increases do not hit seniors in  their pocketbooks and in their doctors’  offices. Speed and bipartisan cooperation are of essence if we are to avoid  this problem.  The suspension authority this rule  provides will allow the House to move  quickly and decisively to move this fix  over to the Senate. The sooner we have  this bill on the President’s desk, the  better off millions of Medicare beneficiaries will be. I urge my colleagues  to  recognize  that  passing  this  bill  quickly is in the best interest of our  constituents, of the Medicare program,  and of our country.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. I’d like to thank my friend,  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  MATSUI) for the time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  House Resolution 766 provides that it  will be in order at any time on the legislative day of today to consider H.R.  3631, the Medicare Premium Fairness  Act. That underlying legislation would  freeze the Medicare part B premium for  2010 at the 2009 rate for beneficiaries  who, under current law, will see a premium increase, along with an expected  freeze in the Social Security cost-of-  living adjustment, COLA, for 2010 and  2011. Both of those combined would  leave seniors with  less  income next  year if Congress does not act. So I support underlying legislation.  Although I support the underlying  legislation that is being brought to the  floor under this rule, I have reservations with the process the majority is  proposing today. And I’m not the only  one who has reservations with that  process.

1564,19,2009-09-24,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  Congress recessed on July 31 for the beginning of the August recess. On that  day, H.R. 3200 passed out of the committees that had jurisdiction. That is  the health care reform bill. It passed  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I serve, late on that  Friday evening, the last day in July.  And  everybody  in  this House went  home for the August recess.  During that period of time, I held  town hall meetings, as did many of my  colleagues. There were TEA parties.  There were freedom rallies. The American public spoke out as they have not  done in a very long time and much of  their frustration centered around the  bill H.R. 3200 that at that point in time  had passed all of the committees of the  House and was ready for action on the  floor.  But the American public sent a message, a message that they don’t like  the runaway spending that Congress  has been engaged in. They don’t like  many of the programs that they think  are  jeopardizing  the  future of  their  children and grandchildren in terms of  the  repayment  responsibilities. But  more than anything else, they sent the  message that they do not want their  health care tampered with and taken  over by the United States Government.  Now, surprisingly, that message apparently has not been heard on the  floor of this House.  Yesterday in the committee of primary jurisdiction that has H.R. 3200,  the bill was, in effect, reopened for further  amendments. Now,  you would  think that if the bill is going to be revisited that we would have heard not  only from the American people but we  would have heard from the President of  the United States, who on September 9  spoke right here on the floor of the  House. At  the  time he  enunciated  issues that he was in favor of. Republicans  agreed with many  of  those  things. But the question we had at the  time was, where is the bill that embodies the things that you say you’re  in favor of? We did not see a bill then,  and, unfortunately, we have not seen  one since that time.  So yesterday in the committee of primary  jurisdiction, you would  think  that we would have seen a bill that embraced the principles that the President  said he was  in  favor of even  though they were not embraced in the  bill that was the only bill before this  House when the President was actually  speaking. You would think  it would  have embraced many of the issues that  the American public said they were  concerned about.  Republicans attempted to offer a bill  that would have embraced those issues  where there should be bipartisan support, but we were not allowed to have  a vote.  There are many issues that are encompassed in this debate. One that I  have supported for a very long time is  that if we are going to use taxpayer  money, we should verify the citizenship  of individuals who are going to receive  the benefits of that taxpayer money because unless that is verified, there is  no validity to simply saying that we  are  not  going  to  spend  taxpayers’  money  for people who have violated  our law and are coming into our country inappropriately.  So the question remains, Where are  we on health care reform? The rumors  now abound that Speaker PELOSI is  about to introduce a bill that purports  to address the issues she’s concerned  with. We haven’t seen the bill. I would  ask the question, Is that bill going to  come before the committees of jurisdiction? Is there going to be a hearing  on it? Are committees going to have  the opportunity to amend it? Or is it  going to go, as so many other things  have gone in this body during these  last few months, straight to the floor  of this House with very little, if any,  opportunity to have an input from the  Representatives, who are the elected  representatives of the people of this  great country?  Those are the questions that still remain. They are still unanswered.  I would conclude, again, if there is  something that we have gained from  what we have heard from the President  and, more particularly, what we have  heard from the American public during  the August recess, where  is the bill  that puts it in writing? We have yet to  see it.  f  THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OF  WHERE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE  GOING  ",2009

1566,19,2009-09-24,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, across  this country there are many people  today who are worried, and they’re  concerned and are even fearful about a  number of things, but two of those  things consistently work their way to  the top.  The first one is the enormous amount  of debt that this country is incurring  and  this administration  is  imposing  upon  our  children  and  our  grandchildren and,  secondly,  the  lack of  transparency of where our dollars are  going.  If you look at the millions of dollars  that have gone to ACORN, no one in  this administration can tell you where  they went and account for them. We  have got millions of dollars going to  banks that no one can account for; billions of dollars in the stimulus package  that no one can account for; billions of  dollars in welfare benefits that no one  can trace and account for. And we have  czars popping up all over the place with  no accountability.  So we look at these people across the  country who are fearful and concerned,  and sometimes we say why are they assembling themselves together and why  are they using some of the language  that they are using? But what are their  options?  And let’s look at just one agency, the  Department of Defense. Many of us  have been concerned that these huge  expenditures are for the first time putting us in a position where our budget  is driving our defense posture as opposed to our defense posture driving  our budget.

1583,68,2009-09-24,Mr. BOND.," Madam President, I rise  today to call for the testimony before  Congress of our  top military  commanders in Afghanistan, GEN Stanley  McChrystal and General Petraeus. Congress and the American people need to  hear directly and as soon as possible  from the generals to ensure that political motivations in Washington do not  override the vital needs of our commanders and our troops on the ground.  Ordinarily, I don’t like the idea of  calling generals away from their duties  in theater but, unfortunately, in the  often surreal world of Washington politics, all the hard work by our military  and  intelligence professionals on the  battlefield in Afghanistan can be undone very quickly. Unfortunately, the  latest verbal wavering by the administration and some of my colleagues in  Congress can do just that.  Last November, when I sent my report, the Roadmap to Success in South  Asia, to then President-elect Obama  and his national security team, I outlined the importance of messaging to  our overall success in Afghanistan and  Pakistan. For  too  long,  the United  States has flailed about with an uncoordinated  communication  plan.  In  other words, we have been off message.  Unfortunately, the enemy has continued to hone its own message. Radical Islamic terrorists have staged suicide attacks for maximum publicity,  propagandizing their message on the  Internet, and convinced their  fellow  terrorists-at-arms that they will defeat  the international community.  Negative and indecisive comments by  the President,  broadcast worldwide,  have now given the enemy a big win in  the public information battle.  On CNN, the President questioned:  ‘‘Are we pursuing the right strategy?’’  On NBC’s  ‘‘Meet  the Press,’’  the  President’s words were even more disturbing, signaling a lack of confidence  in his earlier strategy. The President  said:  If an expanded counterinsurgency strategy  in Afghanistan contributes to the goal of defeating al-Qaida, then we will move forward.  But, if it doesn’t, then I’m not interested in  just being in Afghanistan for the sake of  being in Afghanistan or saving face or . . .  sending a message that America is here for  the duration.  Comments such as these call  into  doubt America’s commitment to Afghanistan. They give hope to the terrorists—hope that America’s resolve is  not real, and that they only need to  wait us out to win the war.  The people of Afghanistan get the  message that we are leaving soon. The  implied message  is  that you better  work with the Taliban and al-Qaida,  because they will be here after America leaves. This is a public bonanza in  diplomacy for our terrorist enemies.  At the same time, these comments  have done a great disservice to our men  and women  serving  in harm’s way.  These heroes need our country’s unwavering support, not vacillation because of political pressures.  President Obama’s recent comments  present a stark and dangerous contrast  to his earlier resolve—resolve that I  applauded on this floor and publicly  and proudly supported. When President  Obama  commissioned  General  McChrystal’s assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, I believed that he  was genuinely interested in receiving  the  general’s  expert,  on-the-ground  perspective and his informed opinion of  what  strategic and  tactical changes  would be required for success.  Unfortunately, it now appears that  the President has developed a sudden  case of buyer’s remorse. It seems increasingly clear to me the Obama administration is inclined to reject the  counterinsurgency  strategy  recently  recommended by General McChrystal  and endorsed by the head of the U.S.  Central  Command,  GEN  David  Petraeus  and  the Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, ADM Mike  Mullen. In a bewildering twist, this is  the same counterinsurgency strategy  the President himself endorsed  this  past March.  I have been a strong and vocal supporter  of  the  administration’s  new  strategy in Afghanistan, so I was particularly disappointed by  the President’s suggestion this past Sunday that  he is reconsidering the American commitment to the war in Afghanistan.  I am also deeply disturbed by press  reports that Defense Secretary Gates  will  delay  sending  General  McChrystal’s  troop  request  to  the  White House because the White House  is not ready to receive it. Given the  President’s resolve this spring, I am  somewhat puzzled by the strange treatment of General McChrystal’s assessment and troop request. Unnecessary  delay is not our friend in this war.  The clearest reason  for this delay  seems to be that the President is considering  not  granting  General  McChrystal’s request. Instead, we are  now hearing that he may push for a  more aggressive covert war against al-  Qaida leadership in Pakistan.  We all want to eliminate the al-Qaida  leadership that plotted and planned the  attacks that claimed more than 3,000  American lives on September 11. And  depending on the details, more aggressive action in Pakistan may be a good  thing. But such action should be in addition to, not a substitute for, giving  our troops in Afghanistan all the resources and supporting personnel they  need to succeed.  While denying al-Qaida and Taliban  militants sanctuary in the border regions of Pakistan is critical, a counterterrorism-only approach,  focusing on  one part of this regional conflict, will  ultimately hand victory to the world’s  most violent and feared terrorists. This  type  of  counterterrorism-only  approach  failed us  in Iraq and  it has  failed us in Afghanistan for the last 7  years.

1584,82,2009-09-24,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," To its credit, the  EPA realized that regulations at the  250-ton level are simply not feasible. So  to try and resolve this issue, the Agency is apparently considering what they  are calling a tailoring proposal. This  would lift the Clean Air Act’s regulatory threshold to 25,000 tons. That is  a hundredfold increase.  I shared the Agency’s concern about  a 250-ton carbon dioxide limit, but this  250-ton proposal moving up to a 25,000-  ton proposal, this tailoring  issue,  is  simply not going to hold. It has no  legal basis. I think we expect it would  be swiftly rejected by the courts. The  EPA cannot constitutionally legislate  a major change in the Clean Air Act.  Ultimately, once this has all played  out, the Agency’s carbon dioxide regulations would remain in effect, but the  threshold would be triggered at a level  100 times lower than the Agency had  planned.  That brings us to the tremendous  consequences we can expect as a result.  There  is widespread agreement  that  the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act would be  absolutely  unworkable  and,  at  the  same time, economically devastating.  In the words of a long-term Democrat  over in the House, it will create a ‘‘glorious mess.’’ Another observed it could  result in ‘‘one of the largest and most  bureaucratic nightmares that the U.S.  economy  and Americans  have  ever  seen.’’  Just this week, the editors of the  Washington Post argued that the Clean  Air Act is ‘‘breathtakingly unsuited to  the great task of battling global warming.’’ The Wall Street Journal’s editors  cast  it as  ‘‘reckless endangerment.’’  They went on to assert that the regulation would be like putting ‘‘a gun to  the head of Congress’’ to ‘‘play cap and  trade roulette with the U.S. economy.’’  That may sound over the top, but  even some members of the environmental community have agreed with  the metaphor, as one clean air advocate affirmed this by saying this regulation is ‘‘the legal equivalent of a .44  magnum.’’  This regulation is a train that could  wreck our fragile economy. It is our  own creation, and it is barreling toward us at full speed. I recently saw an  ironic motivational poster that said:  ‘‘Government—if you think the problems we create are bad, wait until you  see our solutions.’’ It is fair to say that  this issue, the regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, is one of  the many examples of why that poster  was created and, sadly, it occasionally  rings true.  Today,  however,  the  Senate  can  choose another course for the debate  over energy and climate policy. The  Clean Air Act is one of our worst options to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, but it is not our only option for  that cause.  Those of us  in Congress can and  should step up and pass workable, intellectually  honest  climate  legislation—whether it is a system of cap and  trade, a carbon tax, or something else  that removes the Clean Air Act from  the equation. Nearly every participant  in this debate, from elected officials to  businesses and the environmental community, has stated their preference for  legislation over regulation.  That is where my amendment comes  in. For exactly 1 year, it would limit  the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon  dioxide emissions to just the mobile  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:48 Nov 11, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S24SE9.REC S24SE9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

1587,89,2009-09-24,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, I wish to  speak in support of an amendment that  was offered earlier today, actually it  was filed, I think it was attempted to  be called up by Senator MURKOWSKI.  The Democratic majority objected to  getting a vote on that amendment,  which, I think, suggests they do not  want to have a vote on that amendment. Frankly, I can see why.  From what I hear about the whole  debate on climate change and cap-and-  trade legislation that has passed in the  House, it will not be voted on in the  Senate this year. The reason it will not  be voted on is because there are a lot of  people in this Chamber who, I think, do  not want to have that vote because  they know it is a bad vote for them to  make.  Fear not, EPA has come to the rescue of people who want to see a lot of  this  stuff accomplished but do not  want to have to make a tough political  vote on it. So what we are now faced  with is the Environmental Protection  Agency deciding they are going to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean  Air Act and moving forward with the  regulations to do that.  The Murkowski amendment would  essentially prevent  funds  from being  used to do that. It weighs in favor of  having Congress deal with this very  complex,  very  weighty,  very  consequential, and very costly issue to the  American people.  This  legislation, as we all know,  would increase energy prices, cost us  jobs, be unfair to entire regions of the  country, mine included, enlarge an already bloated bureaucracy  in Washington, DC, and put our Nation at a  certain economic disadvantage.  I have been skeptical of that controversial legislation that has passed  the House, the cap-and-trade bill over  there, for some time, for the reasons I  have mentioned.  Additionally, I think it is fair to say  there would be very  little environmental benefit derived from that legislation, were it enacted, without binding,  enforceable  commitments  by  China, by India, and other developing  countries  that  are  now  significant  sources of carbon emissions.  I find it disappointing that in the  middle of this important debate the administration wants to use the back  door—issuing regulations to cap carbon  dioxide under the Clean Air Act because they cannot get a Waxman-Markey type climate bill through the front  door.  Instead, the relevant committees of  this body and the Senate as a whole  should be able to consider whether now  is the right time for a new massive energy tax disguised as an EPA regulation.  During the previous administration,  the EPA had published an Advanced  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that  showed just how impractical it would  be to regulate carbon dioxide and other  greenhouse gases under the Clean Air  Act.  These onerous  regulations  covered  homes,  schools,  churches, hospitals,  small businesses and potentially even  small farms with livestock.  Under the Clean Air Act, the primary  mechanism for regulating carbon emissions would be a fee placed on each ton  of covered pollutant emitted above a  certain threshold.  This fee, if applied to carbon emissions, is nothing more than a tax on  energy that would have severe consequences as our economy struggles to  recover from a long recession.  While the Bush administration regulations never made it past an initial  draft, the Obama EPA is moving quickly to finalize an endangerment finding  and regulate carbon dioxide emissions.  In April 2009, the EPA issued a draft  endangerment  finding  that  linked  emissions from motor vehicles to an  endangerment of human health.  The comment period has closed on  this draft endangerment finding, and  when the EPA issues a final ruling it  will trigger an array of regulations  under the Clean Air Act.  These command and control regulations will  have  far  reaching  consequences for our economy at a time  when we can least afford it.  According to media reports, EPA will  eventually propose regulations for not  just mobile  sources, but  stationary  sources that emit over 25,000 tons of  carbon dioxide.  The first round of regulations on stationary sources would cover approximately 13,000 facilities in the United  States.

1592,96,2009-09-24,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I appreciate  my friend from Maine allowing me to  speak for a couple minutes prior to her  being recognized.  The amendment I have called up allows, not directs, the EPA Administrator to use $500,000 of the funds provided in the bill for preliminary planning and design to work to consolidate  the many agency offices and labs in  Las Vegas into one high-performance  green building.  It doesn’t make a lot of sense to continue spending money on aging facilities spread across several buildings in  need of repair and rehabilitation, particularly with the leases that are not  far from ending. Current costs associated with these facilities’ leases and  their operation cost over $5.5 million  annually.  Consolidation would improve administrative efficiencies and reduce agency  energy, water, and other costs over  time. Developing a more precise estimate of total savings would be part of  the preliminary planning  effort my  amendment authorizes.  The people in the offices and labs I  think could be consolidated would also  greatly benefit from their being able to  work more  closely  together,  given  their mission and activities. These include the agency’s National Exposure  Research Laboratory, the Emergency  Response Team—when something bad  happens with a nuclear device, they are  able to move on that—the Radiation  and  Indoor  Environments  National  Laboratory, the Financial Management  Center, the Human Resources Office,  the National Environmental Research  Center, and the Environmental Services Division’s various laboratories and  Technical Reference Center.  As we know, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the  Recovery Act strongly direct the Federal Government to be a leader, not a  follower,  in adopting green building  technologies. EPA should be at the top  of the list, given its important role,  and I think its labs and facilities in  Las Vegas should serve as a shining example  of  environmental  leadership  that saves the Federal Government and  taxpayers money.  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed  in the RECORD following my  statement a letter to the Appropriations Committee  regarding  this  request, in compliance with paragraph 9  of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of  the Senate.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, September 22, 2009.  Hon. DANIELK. INOUYE,  Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S.  Senate, Washington, DC.  Hon. DIANNEFEINSTEIN,  Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  Hon.

LAMARALEXANDER,  Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEAR CHAIRMAN INOUYE, VICE CHAIRMAN  COCHRAN, CHAIRWOMANFEINSTEIN, ANDRANKINGMEMBERALEXANDER: I am writing to request that the Interior Appropriations bill  for fiscal year 2010 include the discretion for  the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency to use up to $500,000 from  the amounts identified for buildings and facilities for the purpose of preliminary planning and design work to consolidate the  Agency’s Las Vegas offices into one high-performance green building.  Such a consolidation would save taxpayers  money, reduce energy and water use, and improve administrative efficiency. The current  facilities used by the EPA offices and laboratories are in need of rehabilitation and repair and their leases expire in the near future, so it is essential that the Agency begin  making plans for their future use.  Consistent with paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV  of the requirements of the Standing Rules of  the Senate, I certify that neither I nor my  immediate family has a pecuniary interest  in  the  congressionally  directed  spending  items I have requested. I further certify that  I have posted a description of the items requested on my official website, along with  the accompanying justification.  Thank you for your attention to this request  Sincerely,  HARRYREID,  United States Senator.  ",2009

We have been talking about doing  something  about  them  for  decades.  They have been so terribly important  over the years with what has been  going on at the Nevada Test Site and  Yucca Mountain. The leases are about  to run out. It is not fair to the Federal  Government or the university. It would  save the government huge amounts of  money and it would be the right thing  to do.

I am deeply disappointed that a procedural tactic will be invoked to prevent an up-or-down vote on my amendment, which is designed to bring the  proliferation of czars under the normal  process.  The amendment  I proposed would  have ensured that the 18 new czar positions appointed by this administration  could be held accountable to Congress  and to the American people. The proliferation of czars under the current  administration to manage some of the  most complex and  important  issues  facing our country has created serious  problems in oversight, accountability,  and transparency.

1602,103,2009-09-24,Mr. COBURN.," Madam President,  I  switch now to amendment No. 2523,  which is a prohibition on funds being  spent in this act that would actually  limit the effectiveness of the Homeland  Security Department in terms of securing our borders and protecting us.  This amendment basically  ensures  that the wilderness areas and other  public lands are protected from crime  and pollution. I know it is not seen  that way, but what is happening is a  very big and sad story about what is  happening in our wilderness areas.  Border violence and trafficking is at  an  all-time high. Our  public  lands  along the border are being exploited by  drug and human smugglers. Wilderness  concerns hinder  law enforcement efforts. How do we balance properly our  concerns for the environment and still  secure our borders and still protect our  population from both drug smuggling  and human trafficking?  Wilderness areas also are being destroyed by these very smugglers because we do not allow the enforcement  agencies access to be able to make a  difference. We have not acted on it; we  have not acted on it in this bill. We  have to make sure there is the proper  balance between protecting our wilderness areas and protecting our country  and our citizens.  We have sought to address in the last  couple of years our border  security  concerns by appropriating a large increase in Federal funds for law enforcement and for significant legislation to  construct  infrastructure  along  the  southern border.  In the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Congress sought to ensure that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security was able to take the actions  necessary and appropriate to achieve  and maintain the operational control  over the entire international land and  maritime borders of the United States.  The goal of the act was to prevent all  unlawful  entries  into  the  United  States, including entries by terrorists,  narcotics, and other contraband, except it has not had the desired impact,  and in large part, to the unwelcome increase of illegal human and drug trafficking through public lands, along our  southern border. So we have a conflict  of desires by agencies to do their jobs.  Amendment No. 2523 would prohibit  any funds from within the Interior appropriations bill to be used to prohibit  or restrict the activities of Homeland  Security on public lands to secure our  borders. The effect of this amendment  would be to ensure that DHS is able to  further secure our borders from terrorists and other national security threats  and protect the environment of these  lands.  I know there is some concern on the  other side with the language, the way  we have written it. I am more than  willing to work with the chairman of  both the Resources Committee, Interior Committee, and  the Appropriations Committee to try to put that in  a way that properly balances it. I know  this is a tough amendment. I do not  deny that.  But when you hear the testimony—  and I am going to ask that this be  printed in the RECORD.

1603,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, as the  Chair knows, I have long been a supporter of  improving  the quality of  drinking water in rural America. There  is a lot of work to be done. While small  rural communities are home to fewer  than  20 percent of America’s population, they account for more than 85  percent of  the Nation’s  community  water systems, and are more  likely  than larger systems to report major  drinking water violations. According  to EPA data, 93 percent of the maximum contaminant  level, MCL, and  treatment technique, TT, violations reported  in  2002  affected  community  water systems serving fewer than 10,000  people. MCL and TT violations include  higher than allowable levels of organic  and inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, benzene, atrazine, lead, copper  and nitrate.  One significant reason for these high  numbers is the lack of capacity among  local elected officials to deal with the  complexities of maintaining a safe and  clean supply of drinking water. For  this reason I have supported funding  for RCAPs—six regional nonprofit organizations  that help  rural communities with facilities needs.  The technical assistance and training  activities the RCAPs provide focus on  helping communities comply with the  Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking  Water Act. Last year alone, the RCAPs  assisted more than 2,000 communities,  leveraged over $200,000,000 in funding,  conducted 78 training sessions for almost 2,000 community water officials,  and assisted nearly 3 million people to  access safe and clean water. Most of  the communities the RCAPs work with  have populations of less than 1,500.  Funding for the RCAPs has been included in this bill for more than 20  years. I understand that the committee  was  limited by rules regarding earmarks, and I note that funding for the  RCAPs  is not  included  in the  fiscal  year 2010 Senate bill. However, I understand that the House bill includes funding for the RCAPs at the current rate  and it my hope that in conference the  Senate will move toward the House position on this.  ",2009
1604,110,2009-09-24,Mrs. FEINSTEIN., I thank the Senator for his comments on this. I appreciate the difficulties  faced by rural  communities in gaining and maintaining access to adequate drinking water.  I also know well the good work of the  RCAPs in assisting those communities.  As we move into conference on this legislation I look forward to working with  my colleague to see if we can maintain  funding for this important program.  WHITENOSESYNDROME  ,2009
1605,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," I would like to  discuss with  the Senator a  serious  issue  that  deserves  our  attention.  White nose syndrome, WNS, is a fungus  that is causing an extraordinary number of bat deaths, particularly in the  Northeast. This disease has the potential to  inflict widespread ecological,  agricultural,  and  economic  damage  throughout our country. More than 1  million bats have died from New Hampshire to Virginia over the last two winters, and scientists report mortality  rates as high as 100 percent in some affected caves. Experts fear that WNS  could lead to the extinction of many  bat  species  as  the  disease  spreads  across the country.  WNS not only has ecological effects,  but it also has severe economic and environmental  implications. Bats  consume vast quantities of insects, protecting crops and reducing pesticide  use. A single bat can easily eat more  than 3,000 insects a night and an entire  colony will consume hundreds of millions of insects per year. Bats prey on  mosquitoes, which spread disease, and  moths and beetles, which damage agriculture.  With the Senator’s  leadership, the  fiscal year 2010 Interior appropriations  bill has included $500,000 for research to  prevent the spread of WNS, and I thank  the Senator for that.  ",2009
1606,110,2009-09-24,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," I thank Senator  LAUTENBERG. Our offices have worked  together on efforts to provide funding  to fight WNS, and I share his concerns  about this issue.  ",2009
1607,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," As the Senator  knows, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, FWS,  is spearheading efforts to  better understand this deadly disease  and learn how to control its spread.  FWS is working in conjunction with  the U.S. Geological Survey, National  Park Service, and U.S. Forest Service  and with State and local partners, scientists,  and  conservation  organizations. Due to the high mortality rate  and the rapid spread of the disease,  time is of the essence.  ",2009
1608,110,2009-09-24,Mrs. FEINSTEIN., I agree with the  Senator. We must  tackle  this  issue  head-on and make sure all stakeholders  are working together to combat this  challenge.  ,2009
1609,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Experts estimate  that much more funding is needed for  research on WNS. Accordingly, I filed  an important amendment to this bill,  amendment No. 2476, to shift $1.4 million in additional funding to WNS research. My amendment would not put  any other projects or programs at risk,  and it would provide critical resources  to  fight this disease.  I ask  for the  chairman’s  assurance  that  she will  work in conference to implement my  amendment.  ",2009
1610,110,2009-09-24,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," As  I mentioned  earlier, I share the Senator’s concerns  and agree that we need to focus more  attention and  resources on WNS.  I  commit to work in conference to increase funding for this disease as called  for in his amendment.  CLEANAUTOMOTIVETECHNOLOGY  ",2009
1611,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I want to  bring to the attention of the distinguished chair of  the Appropriations  Subcommittee on  Interior, Environment and Related Agencies a very important program in my State. The Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI, leads EPA’s  Clean Automotive Technology Program by facilitating collaboration with  the automotive industry through innovative research to achieve ultra low-  pollution emissions, increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases.  One of the programs that has been  developed collaboratively through the  Ann Arbor laboratory and its industry  partners is the hydraulic hybrid technology which has come out of the laboratory’s focus areas in hydraulic hybrid research, engine research, alternative fuels research and technical and  analytical support. This technology offers potential to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions by 50 percent.  The President’s fiscal year 2010 budget  increases  the Climate Protection  Program line in EPA’s budget, which  includes this facility, and I appreciate  the subcommittee’s concurrence with  the request in the bill before the Senate.  It  is my understanding  that  the  version of  the bill adopted by  the  House of Representatives provides an  additional $1.6 million over the fiscal  year 2010 budget request. Is that also  the understanding of the Senator from  California?  ",2009
1612,110,2009-09-24,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," The Senator is correct. The President’s budget proposed  $18.975 million for the Climate Protection Program, and that is the same  amount  proposed  in  this  bill. The  House  of  Representatives  approved  $20.575 million.  ",2009
1613,110,2009-09-24,Mr. LEVIN.," I hope to provide additional  funding  for  this program  in  order to fund a demonstration program  to deploy hybrid hydraulic technology  in larger fleet vehicles, such as school  buses. Demonstration of this hybrid  hydraulic technology, through its incorporation into a fleet of school buses,  would not only bring these fuel-efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  technologies closer to wide-scale viability and acceptance but also provide  EPA with important data to support  its work  in  developing  achievable  standards for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions.  As the conference committee considers  the  differences  between  the  House and Senate bills, I am hopeful  that  the additional  $1.6 million  included in the House bill will be maintained and that serious consideration  will be given to directing this funding  to demonstration of the hybrid hydraulic technology I have described.  ",2009

The Whiffenpoofs,  as  every Yalie  knows, are unsurpassed in talent and  tradition. They are now the oldest continuously functioning collegiate a cappella  singing  group  in  the United  States.  Their history  is rich and vibrant.  During World War II, the brave men of  the U.S. Army Air Force’s Black Sheep  Squadron adopted  ‘‘The Whiffenpoof  Song’’ as their theme song. And over  the course of the 20th century, that famous tune has been recorded by such  legendary artists as Bing Crosby, Ella  Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Elvis  Presley.  The Whiffenpoofs have  inspired  a  cappella singing groups at colleges and  secondary schools across America—in  fact, there are now more than 1,200  such groups entertaining audiences.  But their influence is not limited by  our  borders.  Each  year,  the  Whiffenpoofs  embark  on  an  international tour, visiting foreign capitals  and tiny villages, great palaces and  humble churches, and U.S. Embassies  around the world, spreading song and  good will on behalf of Yale University  and America’s college students.  Next month, Whiffenpoofs  alumni  from around the world will descend  upon Yale to convene with the current  group  in  celebration  of  the  Whiffenpoofs’ centennial. It is sure to  be an occasion filled with good cheer,  great music, and tremendous  fellowship—the trademarks of this beloved  Connecticut institution.  Mr. President,  I  congratulate  the  Whiffenpoofs  of Yale University  on  their  centennial,  I  thank  them  for  their many contributions to our Nation, and I  look  forward to another  century of song and friendship.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO STEVE AND SHELLEY  BRUNE  ∑",2009
1619,138,2009-09-24,Mr. JOHANNS.," Mr. President, Steve  and Shelley Brune are extraordinary  Nebraskans who made a commitment  to open their hearts and home to a foster child, which led to a remarkable  story of love and compassion.  In September  1999,  they welcomed  Jonathon into their home as a foster  child. In February 2001, Jonathon’s biological brother, James, was also removed from the home. The Brune family recognized the importance of keeping  siblings  together and agreed  to  unite the brothers by welcoming James  into  their home as a  second  foster  child.  The Brunes worked closely with the  Nebraska Department of Health and  Human Services, HHS, in efforts to reunite Jonathon and James with their  biological parents. When HHS determined that reunification was not in the  boys’ best interest, Steve and Shelley  made a permanent commitment to the  boys by adopting them; Jonathon on  July 19, 2001 and James on January 17,  2002.  In October 2007, the biological sister  of James and Jonathon, Mary Ann, was  removed  from  the home. HHS contacted the Brune family to discuss the  possibility of once again becoming foster  parents. The Brunes  recognized  that this child needed a loving home  and would benefit from being with her  brothers. For a third time, they admirably opened their hearts and home,  welcoming Mary Ann on July 15, 2008.  In April 2009, another sibling, Madeline Grace, was born and was also removed from the home. The Brune family showed tremendous compassion and  devotion to the children of this family  by  agreeing  to  welcome Madeline  Grace  into  their  family. Steve and  Shelley are currently in the process of  adopting both Mary Ann and Madeline  Grace.  It is with heartfelt admiration that I  nominate Steve and Shelley Brune as  Adoption Angels. Their  capacity  to  love and care for these four children is  an inspiration and worthy example for  others to follow. My hope is that their  story inspires others to consider opening  their hearts and homes  to  the  many children awaiting adoption,  in  need of loving families.  May God bless Shelley, Steve, Jonathan,  James, Mary Ann, Madeline  Grace, and all adoptive parents who  give children the gift of a loving family.∑  f  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  BRICKLAYERS  AND ALLIED CRAFT WORKERS  ∑",2009

1621,145,2009-09-24,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I rise today  to introduce three pieces of legislation:  the Water Efficiency and Conservation  Investment Act, S. 1711, the Water Efficiency, Conservation and Adaptation  Act, S. 1712, and the Water Efficiency  via Carbon Harvesting and Restoration  Act, S. 1713.  Water is our world’s most precious  and  important  limited  natural  resource—access  to water  is vital  for  every person and life form on this planet. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, a Hungarian  Nobel Prize winning doctor, once said  that ‘‘water is life’s mater and matrix,  mother and medium. There is no life  without water.’’  While Nevada is blessed with beautiful desert landscapes and tremendous  clean energy  resources, we are not  blessed with abundant water supplies.  That is why I am introducing legislation together with my friend Senator  ENSIGNand others that will: encourage  Americans  to use water more  efficiently; ensure that future generations  have access to adequate supplies of  clean water; and convert water stealing  invasive weeds to sequestered carbon  and clean-burning fuels.  A lengthy drought is taking its toll  on the Colorado River Basin states, especially Nevada, Arizona, and California. More than 30 million people rely  on water  from  the Colorado River,  which supplies Southern Nevada with  90 percent of its water. Water levels at  Lake Mead, where water used by 1.9  million  Nevadans  is  stored,  have  dropped by  roughly  100  feet.  If  the  drought  in the Southwest continues  the lake could dry up in the next 12  years, according to a study by the  Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Growing population, rising water demand, climate change induced disruptions to the water cycle, aging infrastructure, and water disputes all necessitate early action so the water resources we rely on today can be enjoyed by the next generation.  Even without considering the effects  of  climate  change,  the U.S. Global  Change Research Program has identified many serious water supply conflicts  in  the Colorado River Basin  states  by  2025.  Factoring  in  the  USGCRP’s projection  that precipitation runoff will decrease in the Southwest by up to 40 percent in some areas  over the next half century as a result  of a changing climate, it is clear that  immediate and constant attention is  and will be necessary to address these  water supply problems.  Legislation is urgently needed to promote greater water efficiency and create better  financing options  for  improving our infrastructure to save, recycle and reuse water. Strong tax incentives to make our homes and yards  more water efficient and to increase investments in extending the life of our  existing water supplies will help secure  water scarce regions against the economic and health catastrophes  that  would occur  if  their water  supplies  were to run dry.  We need to invest meaningfully in  planning  for, adapting  to and mitigating the effects of climate change on  water supplies and water  infrastructure with which Nevadans are becoming all too familiar. It is important  that we start planning right away for a  more secure water supply future.  Investing  in water  efficiency  and  adapting our water systems to a changing climate not only prepares us for  the future, it also can save consumers  hundreds of dollars on their water bills.  Additionally, adequate funding for the  legislation  I  am  introducing  today  could create tens of thousands of jobs.  A $1 million direct investment in water  efficiency  is estimated to create between 15 and 22 jobs—more than double  the jobs created by coal or oil investments.  Together, the Water Efficiency and  Conservation Investment Act and the  Water Efficiency, Conservation and Adaptation Act provide the right balance  of tax incentives, financing and grant  programs to begin formulating a national strategy to address these pressing needs and ensure that current and  future Nevadans will have greater and  more sustainable economic growth opportunities.  The Water Efficiency via Carbon Harvesting and Restoration Act also helps  protect our water resources, and does  much more. Invasive weeds and dangerous fuels buildup in Western landscapes have become recipes for disaster  on a seemingly annual basis. The Bureau of Land Management has estimated that a single acre of salt cedar  robs our watersheds of nearly a million  gallons of water each year. The National Park Service has found that the  infestation  at Lake Mead National  Recreation Area alone covers almost  7,000 acres. Removing the salt cedar  from  this  one  area would  restore  enough water to satisfy the needs of  72,000 Las Vegas residents.  At  the  same  time,  expansion  of  pinyon and juniper now covers up to 9  million acres of the public lands in the  Great Basin,  forming dense thickets  impenetrable to most wildlife, and creating enormous wildland fire hazards.  Using biochar production technology,  we can restore these  impacted  landscapes, while producing valuable products  that can help address climate  change through long term carbon sequestration,  benefit  agriculture  and  the environment by reducing the need  for chemical  fertilizers, and produce  cleaner-burning fuels to help meet our  Nation’s energy needs. All of this can  be achieved while saving billions of  gallons of water, reducing the risks of  hotter and more difficult to extinguish  wildfires, and creating rural economic  development opportunities.

1622,152,2009-09-24,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, technology has transformed the way we  work, the way we entertain ourselves,  and the way we understand the world  around us. But one area of our lives  that has been more resistant to technological change has been the way we  educate our children. And yet I see tremendous potential in technology to improve access to education and decrease  its often high costs. One example of  this  is  open  educational  resources.  Today, I am introducing a bill that will  provide a  short-term  federal  investment in the development of one type of  open  educational  resource—college  textbooks.  I believe this  investment  will  improve  learning  in our college  classrooms and help bring down the  cost of college for students.  The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and sharing of open  content. A teacher or professor in Illinois can create a lecture, a lesson, a  book, or an  entire  curriculum and  share it online. A teacher across the  country or even across the world can  access that educational material, adapt  it, and use it in his or her classroom.  More and more often educators are utilizing technology in this way to improve student learning.  The President recognizes the potential of this new technology. He has proposed a significant new Federal investment in the creation of online open-  source courses for community colleges.  These  courses will  be made  freely  available online and widely distributed  so that all colleges can make use of  them. I believe this initiative will help  make higher education more accessible  for students, especially non-traditional  students or students  living  in rural  areas far away from brick-and-mortar  institutions. Because the courses will  be available for free, the initiative will  also help bring down the high cost of a  college education for students struggling to pay.  I think we can go even further. The  high cost of textbooks continues to be  a barrier for many students struggling  to pay for college. The College Board  reported that for the 2007 to 2008 school  year, students spent an estimated $805  to $1,229 on books and supplies. A little  over a year ago, the Higher Education  Opportunity Act was signed into law.  That law includes provisions that I authored to increase transparency in college textbook pricing for professors and  students. I hope that new law will help  decrease the high cost of textbooks  when these provisions are enacted next  year, but there is more that the Federal Government can do  to provide  cheap alternatives to professors and  students.  The bill I am introducing today, the  Open College Textbook Act, will create  a grant program for the creation of  freely-available,  online  open  college  textbooks. Making high-quality open  textbooks freely available to the general public would significantly lower  college textbook costs. Under my bill,  the  Secretary  of  Education would  award grants to colleges, professors,  nonprofit organizations or  for-profit  companies to create introductory-level  college  textbooks.  Once  produced,  these books would be posted on an easily-accessible website and made available to students, professors, and the  public for free. The result would be a  set of high-quality college textbooks  that could be adopted in any introductory course at any college in the country. This would be a limited investment of Federal grant  funding over  just a few years, not a permanent federal funding stream. The choice would  ultimately  still  be  the  professor’s.  Each professor could choose whether to  assign the open textbook to his class,  but I hope that he would seriously consider this high-quality, free online option that would save his students $150  or $200 each at the college bookstore.  Along with the clear cost benefits,  open textbooks can also improve teaching and learning. The content of an  open textbook can be adapted, supplemented, and personalized by professors  for their course. Instead of framing a  course around a textbook, a professor  can modify an open textbook to fit the  needs of a particular course or group of  students. When professors take advantage of the flexibility and adaptability  of open textbooks, student learning improves.  The use of Federal funding for textbooks and curricula is not new. For  years, the National Science Foundation has been awarding grants to professors for research into the improvement of  learning  in  the classroom.  Sometimes these grants have resulted  in the creation of textbooks, which the  author can then license for profit to a  commercial publisher. I believe textbooks created with Federal  funding  should be made available for free so  that all students and professors can  benefit from our investment. This bill  would also require that all future Federal grants that lead to the creation of  a textbook or curriculum for use in the  classroom be licensed openly and made  freely available to all educators  for  their use.  Over the past decade, I have watched  textbook publishers use technology to  drive up the cost of textbooks through  unnecessary online  supplements and  CD–ROMs. It is time that we use the  potential of technology to improve college access, learning, and affordability  for all students. I believe the Open College Textbook Act that I am  introducing today will accomplish that goal.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1714  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Open College  Textbook Act of 2009’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  Congress finds the following:  (1) The growth of the Internet has enabled  the creation and sharing of open content, including open educational resources.  (2) The President has proposed a new, significant Federal investment in the creation  of online open-source courses for community  colleges that will make learning more accessible, adaptable, and affordable for students.  (3) The President  has  challenged  the  United States with a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by  2020.  (4) More than 80 percent of the 23,000,000  jobs that will be created in the next 10 years  will  require postsecondary education, but  only 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year olds are  currently  enrolled  in  postsecondary  education.  (5) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a barrier for many students in  achieving higher education, and according to  the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 200,000 qualified students fail  to enroll in college each year due to cost.  (6) The College Board reported that for the  2007–2008 academic year an average student  spent an estimated $805 to $1,229 on college  books and supplies.  (7) Making high quality open textbooks  freely available to the general public could  significantly  lower college textbook costs  and increase accessibility to such education  materials.  (8) Open textbooks can improve learning  and teaching by creating course materials  that are more flexible, adaptable, and accessible through the use of technology.  SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

1628,166,2009-09-24,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  mourn the loss of a dear friend to the community of Muncie, Indiana.  Lenette Freeman, known to all as a giving  and determined woman, passed away  following a five year battle with cancer. Though  the pain of her passing is deeply felt, we will  continue to be inspired by the life she led.  Lenette Freeman was born on October 29,  1958, in Evanston, Illinois to Leonard and Dolores Hartowicz. A graduate of Taft High  School in Chicago, Lenette went on to receive  her bachelor’s degree and a teaching certificate from Northern Illinois University.  In 1987, Lenette moved to Muncie, where  she would become an active leader and vital  asset in this eastern Indiana Community. She  was a member of the Lutheran Church of the  Cross,  the  Rotary  Club,  the  Muncie  Endurathon,  and  co-founder  of  the  youth  Academy  for Community Leadership. For 4  years, Lenette served as the executive director of the Muncie Children’s Museum, a children’s educational learning facility in the community.  When the City of Muncie authorized the creation of a Mayor’s Youth Council  in 2002,  Lenette  volunteered  countless hours as a  mentor to the young students on the founding  Council and remained active in the years to  follow. Her  impact on  the members of  the  Mayor’s Youth Council, as well as the effect  the Council had in the community, will be felt  far into the future.  In 2004, Lenette was named director of the  Cardinal Greenway. The Cardinal Greenway is  a series of  recreational  trails spanning 27  miles  throughout my  district.  Lenette was  keenly aware of  the benefits of  these  trails  and advocated for its continued development.  Her passion and dedication to the preservation  and extension of the trails will forever be remembered by a grateful community.  Just one month after becoming Director of  the Cardinal Greenway, Lenette was diagnosed with cancer. Rather than succumbing to  feelings of self-pity and defeat, Lenette said  her diagnosis was a ‘‘blessing in disguise’’ that  resulted  in a greater appreciation of people  and deeper relationships with  them. Despite  her illness, Lenette was a determined fighter  and continued her work with  the Greenway,  holding meetings in her home and working via  teleconference when necessary.  Lenette’s determination was evident not only  in her work, but in her personal life. She was  the proud mother of three boys, and she encouraged each of them to pursue their own individual talents and goals. Fondly referred to  as her ‘‘cowboys,’’ her boys were undoubtedly  a major source of strength and inspiration in  Lenette’s fight against cancer.  Lenette will be sorely missed by her sons,  her mother and three siblings, those fortunate  enough  to know her, as well as  the entire  Muncie Community.  We have  lost an  important  figure  in  the  Muncie community, but I know that Lenette’s  legacy will not soon be forgotten. Let us keep  Lenette’s  three boys,  family, and cherished  friends in our prayers during this difficult time.  ‘‘NATIONAL JOB CORPS DAY’’  SPEECHOF  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO  SABLAN  OFCOMMONWEALTHOFTHENORTHERNMARIANA  ISLANDS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 22, 2009  ",2009
1629,166,2009-09-24,Mr. SABLAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H. Con. Res. 163, which designates  September 23, 2009, as ‘‘National Job Corps  Day.’’ Across the nation, thousands of youth  are participating in programs that bring positive  change  to  their  communities,  to  their  peers, and  to  themselves. Job Corps volunteers earn money to support themselves and  their families, work towards high school diplomas, improve their own literacy, learn valuable  new job skills, and secure employment or military commissions.  But volunteers like the young people in Job  Corps can affect members of their community  in ways that can last a lifetime. When I was  growing up in the Northern Mariana Islands, I  strengthened my English skills by talking with  and  learning  from Peace Corps volunteers.  One of  those Corps members gave me my  first book of English Literature. These dedicated young volunteers, like the young people  in Job Corps, make an enormous difference in  the lives of so many. Even in places like the  Northern Marianas, eight thousand miles away  from Washington,  their help  is needed, and  where they have been, their presence is still  remembered and deeply appreciated.  I congratulate the Job Corps program on its  45th anniversary, and wish it many more to  come.  I urge my colleagues  to support  this  resolution.  f  TOWN OF  INDIAN SHORES, FLORIDA CELEBRATES ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. C. W. BILL YOUNG  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 24, 2009  ",2009
1630,166,2009-09-24,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Madam Speaker, the  Town of  Indian Shores, Florida, which  I not  only have the privilege to represent but also  call my home, this week celebrates the 60th  anniversary of the signing of its town charter.  Although  I was not be able  to be  there  today as the House is in session, my friends  and neighbors gathered at The Pub Restaurant to celebrate their 60 years of progress,  development and success.  Indian Shores, first known as Indian Rocks  Beach South Shore, is a small but beautiful island on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Its sandy  white beaches and crystal clear water made it  a favorite summer retreat dating back to the  late 1800s. It was on September 16, 1949 that  42 registered voters and  freeholders met at  the Beach Park Restaurant, where The Pub is  now located, to incorporate the Town of Indian  Rocks Beach South Shore.  At that meeting, the residents of the newly  established town elected their first town leaders: Edward Fitch Taylor as Mayor, Bernice  Pitt as Town Clerk, Emory Boyd as Town Marshall, and as Aldermen: Mrs. E. Boyd, Harry  Gooding, Russel West, H. Tinman, James  Roesler, Hubert Tipton, Estelle Harper, Pearl  Cook, and Arthur Goble.  The town held a special referendum in July  1973 and voted to rename itself the Town of  Indian Shores, as it is known today.  From the early leadership that established  this beautiful beach haven, new  leadership  has led Indian Shores into this new century  and into a thriving community. Mayor Jim Lawrence, Vice Mayor Joan Herndon, Councilor  Steve Sutch, Councilor Bill Smith, and Councilor Carole Irelan are the town’s elected leaders. They oversee a staff headed by Town Administrator Chief E. D. Williams, Town Clerk  Marcia Grantham, Deputy Clerk Elaine Jackson, Building Official Larry Nayman, Administrative Assistant Joyce Ciccarello, Director of  Finance Mary Karayianes, Public Service Supervisor Jim Jeeter, and Assistant to the Town  Manager Bonnie Dhonau.  They govern a  town of 1,800 permanent  residents and 2,600 homes  that swells  to a  town of 6,000 during the peak winter months.  Although only 2.6 miles  long,  this  town  remains one of Florida’s most beautiful beach  communities. From its early history when legend has  it  that an elderly  Indian Chief was  brought to its shores to be healed by its special water, to its time as an Indian campsite,  Indian Shores has grown and prospered yet  retained its small town charm.  Madam Speaker, the Town’s motto says it  all—‘‘Indian Shores—A Great Place to Live.’’ I  am proud to call Indian Shores my home and  I  join  in celebrating  its  rich history and  its  bright and sunny future along Florida’s most  beautiful beaches.  f  NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE  FOR HOMICIDE VICTIMS  HON. TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 24, 2009  ",2009
1631,166,2009-09-24,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker, September 25th is the National Day of Remembrance for Homicide Victims. On this day, it is  important for all of us to reflect on the terrible  toll  that violence  takes on our communities,  and for us to reflect on ways to reduce this violence. One type of homicide that is particularly disturbing  is when  the perpetrator  is a  partner of the victim. According to the Centers  for Disease Control, on average, three women  a day are murdered by their current or former  husbands. That is three women a day who are  killed by the very same man who took an oath  to honor and protect them.  This number should be disturbing to all of  us. We are not doing enough to keep women  safe in their own homes, the very place where  we should all  find safety and comfort. Too  many American women are finding danger, violence, and even death in their own homes.  One-third—yes, that’s right—one-third, of all  murdered  females are killed by somebody  they were  in a  relationship with. That  is a  staggering  statistic. These women are not  being killed by a stranger in a dark alley, they  are being killed by people they trust, often in  their own homes.  To bring attention to this issue, Congresswoman Edwards and  I have  introduced H.  Res. 757, to support the goals and ideals of  the National Day of Remembrance for Homicide Victims. It is my hope that this resolution  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:42 Sep 25, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K24SE8.003 E24SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
1632,173,2009-09-24,Mr. MCCOTTER.," Madam Speaker, today I  rise  to honor  the extraordinary  life of Judge  James E. Mies, a retired Wayne Circuit Court  judge, who passed away Monday at the age  of 81.  For almost 25 years, Judge Mies pursued  truth and  impartiality behind  the bench and  was well-regarded both as a  lawyer and a  judge. Judge Mies was a 1951 graduate of the  University of Detroit law school and served in  the Livonia law firm of Brashear and Brashear.  In 1969, he was elected a district  judge  in  Livonia.  In 1981, Governor William Milliken  named  Judge Mies  to  the Wayne Circuit  Court, where he served until his retirement in  1993.  Judge Mies was perhaps best known for his  handling of Wayne County’s numerous asbestos lawsuits. Colleagues remembered him as,  first and foremost, a decent man whose rulings were meticulously  thought out. Outside  the courtroom, Judge Mies was active in the  Optimists,  the Michigan Cancer Foundation  and other civic organizations and in 1993, the  Livonia City Council named a park  in his  honor.  On  September  21,  2009,  Judge Mies  passed away after a lengthy illness. A beloved  husband and father, he is survived by his wife  of 59 years, Mary Patricia, his sons Edward,  James, Gerald and Michael, his daughters  Jean and Catherine (Diamond), as well as thirteen  grandchildren  and  two  great-grandchildren. He is predeceased by his son Thomas. The citizens of Wayne County were privileged  to have been served by  this erudite  judge for a quarter of a century.  Madam Speaker, Judge Mies  is  remembered as a philanthropist, mentor, and friend.  As we bid him farewell, I ask my colleagues  to join me in mourning his passing and honoring the contributions he made to society.  f  A PROCLAMATION HONORING BUD  WEISGARBER FOR WINNING THE  GIRLS’ DIVISION IV STATE SOFTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP  HON.

These  four men—Chinese Uighurs—  had been cleared by the federal government  for release but were unable to be sent to their  home country of China, for fear for their safety  and  in compliance with  international human  rights law.  The United States has been working with  other countries to effect a safe and efficient  process  for  resettling detainees cleared of  wrongdoing and scheduled for release. This is  a complicated and difficult process but has resulted in approximately 15 resettled detainees  since President Obama  took office. Four of  those went  to Bermuda. Dozens more have  been cleared  for  release but have not yet  been transferred to a third-party nation.  In a May 2009, visit  to  the White House,  Premier Ewart Brown of Bermuda generously  offered  to assist  the United States  in  relocating released detainees from the detention  facility at Guantanamo. One month later the  four Uighurs were  transported  to Bermuda,  where they currently receive government assistance to integrate into the surrounding community, including work at a local golf course.  Madam Speaker,  I appreciate Bermuda—  our friend and ally—assisting us in the effort to  resolve the complex problem of resettling detainees cleared  for release. The  fact of  the  matter is that the Bush administration’s reckless approach to establishing an extrajudicial  system at Guantanamo has left us grappling  with how to humanely and effectively resettle  detainees who pose no threat to our national  security. To that end we owe the people of  Bermuda sincere thanks for taking on the responsibility of ensuring  the  rights and well-  being of these four released detainees, who  have been cleared of any wrongdoing. Bermuda and the United States have set a positive example  for  the safe, efficient, and humane process of releasing former detainees.

The Chair will entertain up to 15 further requests for 1-  minute speeches on each side of the  aisle.  HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2009
1637,1,2009-10-07,Mr. BACA.," Reforming health insurance must be our duty and responsibility. The vast majority of Americans  have health insurance. The question is  what does our health insurance reform  mean for them.  It means that insurance companies  no longer will decide to deny your coverage or jack up your insurance rate  because of preexisting conditions.  It means that it will be against the  law for insurance companies to drop  your coverage when you get sick or  water it down when you need it the  most.  It means that there will be a yearly  limit on how much you can be charged  for out-of-pocket expenses, because no  one should go broke because they get  sick.  It means that premiums will stop  growing three times faster than your  wages, because more competitiveness  in  insurance markets will hold premiums down.  It means that if you lose your job or  change your job, you’ll be able to get  affordable coverage.  In short, what health insurance reform means for millions of Americans  who are insured today is more security  and stability. Americans should not  have to wait longer for this reform.  Congress must act this year.  f  CONGRATULATING THE CENTER  FOR DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS  (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and  was given permission to address the  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

1638,8,2009-10-07,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my colleague  from Massachusetts for yielding me time, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I come before you today  deeply concerned by this conference  agreement. This legislation that was  originally brought to the House was offered under a closed rule. Throughout  this appropriations season, the Democrat majority took unprecedented steps  to silence both the minority and their  own Democrat colleagues by offering  all appropriations bills under closed  rule. This has consistently eliminated  the ability for Members to speak up for  how their constituents believe their  money should be spent.  This is not the way the House should  be operating, and we want to express  again our concern about this and will  be doing that throughout our time in  discussing the rule this morning.  I will urge my colleagues to vote not  only against the rule but against the  previous question.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1641,8,2009-10-07,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my  friend  from Grandfather community for yielding me the time.  I rise with a great deal of concern,  Mr. Speaker, for what is taking place  here. My  friend  from Worcester has  talked about the commitment to nutrition programs.  I  share his  concern  about nutrition, child nutrition especially. It is a very high priority. And  anyone, anyone who tries to characterize those of us who are opposed to  this conference report as being opposed  to child nutrition is totally off base.  I was just speaking to my good friend  Mr. CONAWAY, who is a member of the  Agriculture Authorization Committee,  and he points to the fact that while we  look at this conference report, every  single line item, every single line item  has had a plus-up, an increase, and it  brings to that total a 14 percent increase.  Now, Mr. CONAWAYhas reminded me  that we can have that strong commitment, as we do in a bipartisan way, to  nutrition. There are other areas where  cuts can be made. And so again, once  again,  the  tired old argument  that  somehow those of us who are Republicans want to throw children out in  the street and have them starve is a  nonstarter. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues not to continue with that  kind of argument.  Now, there are other concerns that  exist. We have the 14 percent increase  with this measure. We have something  known as air-dropping, which is a violation of House rules, and this rule  waives a measure which provides an addition of items that were never considered by this House or considered by our  colleagues  in the other body  in the  Senate. That is described as a scope  violation. It means that neither House  considered  it and yet  the conferees  came together and without a single  hearing, without any kind of deliberation, they just dropped a couple of provisions into the conference report.  Now, Mr. Speaker, this  is what  is  leading us to raise concern that is bipartisan on the fact that this House is  not taking the amount of time that it  should to look at legislation, and this  came to the forefront on June 26 of this  year.  On June 26 at 3 in the morning, my  Rules colleagues and I were sitting upstairs in the Rules Committee and my  friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, offered the motion that would allow us to move ahead  with the cap-and-trade bill. As he was  reading that motion, Mr. Speaker, as  he was  reading  that motion,  I had  dropped on my lap at 3 in the morning  a 300-page amendment to the cap-and-  trade bill. No one on that committee  had had an opportunity to look at it.  We know that most Members of the  House had not read it. What did it lead  to? It led to our very, very strong level  of degree of outrage, and it led our minority leader to use a great deal of  time, taking 1 hour to actually walk  through that 300-page amendment. The  by-product of that, Mr. Speaker, has  been outrage across this country.  I have spent most of my career here  focused on process. I believe process is  substance. But many of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle, when I talk  about process, make it very clear that  they and their constituents have their  eyes glaze over. But guess what, Mr.  Speaker? The American people understand when you don’t take the time to  deliberate and read and look at legislation.  Now, I will admit that in Republican  Congresses, we have waived the 3-day  layover requirement. In  fact,  in the  109th Congress, on  40 occasions we  waived the 3-day layover requirement.  But, Mr. Speaker, we were told that in  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:01 Oct 08, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07OC7.002 H07OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1644,15,2009-10-07,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to insert into the RECORDan  article  from the Star-News entitled,  ‘‘Hungry Eyes—More N.C. children go  without food.’’  [From the Wilmington (NC) Star News, Aug.  15, 2009]  HUNGRYEYES—MOREN.C. CHILDRENGO  WITHOUTFOOD  (By Amanda Greene)  The three children hadn’t eaten a full meal  in two days.  In desperation, their grandparents knocked  on  the door of a downtown Wilmington  church.  The children waited in the car as their  grandparents asked the minister at the door  for help.  He gave them a box of pop-top cans of Vienna sausages and pork and beans.  ‘‘They got the food, drove out of the parking lot and stopped beside the road to feed  the kids right away,’’ said Jennifer Caslin,  development manager at  the Wilmington  branch of the Food Bank of Central and  Eastern North Carolina.  Such scenes are increasingly common here  and throughout the state as joblessness and  the weak economy put ever greater strains  on an already thin safety net. You don’t have  to look hard to see hungry children in North  Carolina. Whether  it’s  families  skipping  breakfast so the food will stretch through  dinner, or eating packaged  foods, because  fruits  and  vegetables  are  too  expensive,  many of the state’s children aren’t eating  balanced, nutritious meals.  In May, Feeding America, the largest food  bank network in the country, released the  results of its first analysis of food insecurity  in early childhood, ‘‘Child Food Insecurity in  the United States: 2005–2007.’’ North Carolina  ranked second worst in the nation with 24.1  percent of its children under 5 judged to be  food insecure and lacking regular access to  nutritional food. The state was 10th worst in  the same Feeding America study of food insecurity in children 0–18 years old, using figures  from  the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nationally, the food insecurity average is 17 percent for children under 5.  Demand for food at the nation’s food banks  has increased 30 percent in the past year,  said Ross Fraser, media relations manager  for Feeding America. ‘‘So many people have  been plunged into poverty,’’ he said, ‘‘and  it’s terrible for children because it stunts  their growth in all ways.’’  Indicators of  food  insecurity  in North  Carolina include high child poverty rates,  the 11 percent unemployment rate, broken  families, the high price of fresh food and a 21  percent  increase  in households with  food  stamps since 2007, said Alexandra Sirota, director of policy and research, Action  for  Children North Carolina in Raleigh.  North Carolina ranked 37th in child well-  being  in  the  recently  released  2009 Kids  Count Data Book from the Annie E. Casey  Foundation using factors such as the percent  of low-birth-weight babies, infant mortality  rate, child death rate, teen death rate, teen  birth rate, percent of teenaged high school  dropouts, percent of  teens not attending  school and not working, percent of children  in families without a parent with full-time  and year-round employment, percent of children in poverty and percent of children in  single-parent families. The state did improve  one level from its 38th ranking in 2008.  Often the youngest children fall through  the cracks, subject to their parents’ ability—  or inability— to provide nutritious foods.  ‘‘There are a  lot of programs that are  available once (kids) get into the school system, but those aren’t always available for  young children until  school age,’’ Sirota  added. ‘‘The fact that families are both losing their jobs and earning such low wages  that they’re living in extreme poverty is an  indicator of that added stress when you’re  trying to feed the family.’’  BRIDGINGTHEGAP  When parents can’t feed their children regularly, often the schools, local social service  networks and churches try to fill the need.  And in the summers, when school’s out,  the need for meals for children increases.  The New Hanover County  school district  hosts a federally-funded Summer Food Service for Children Program at 15 schools and  community centers in the county for any  child, 18 years old or younger, to eat a lunch-  time meal. For six weeks this summer, the  program served about 700 kids each day.  That number is slightly lower than previous  years because funding for the program came  in after the end of school this year and didn’t  get advertised, said Anne Ohlson, schools  child nutrition supervisor.  ‘‘We do see a lot of hungry children who  are waiting for us when we show up with the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:51 Oct 08, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07OC7.022 H07OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1660,29,2009-10-07,Mr. CAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Since  September 11, American military, diplomatic  and  intelligence  personnel  have seen extended and recurring deployments in support of contingency  operations  in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  These brave Americans have answered  the call and, at the drop of a hat, gone  off to defend this great Nation in a  most consequential time. This House  and the American people are extremely  grateful for their courage and sacrifice.  Today, as we rotate personnel home  from Iraq and contemplate increasing  force levels in Afghanistan, Congress  can ease the transition  for those  in  uniform by ensuring existing homeownership tax incentives are flexible  for their circumstances. This bill does  that. It modifies the existing first-time  homebuyer tax credit to make it fairer  for military and diplomatic  families  deploying overseas or returning home  who, under the way the current credit  is written, may be unable to take advantage. These provisions are based  heavily on language included in bills  that many,  including my  colleague  from Louisiana, CHARLES and  from North  Carolina, WALTER  JONES, have championed for some time.  The bill also helps military families  relocating as part of the Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, process.  As DOD has transformed its base infrastructure, many service families have  had difficulty selling homes adjacent  to military installations because of declining values and an unprecedented  slowdown in the housing market. In  the stimulus bill, Congress provided relief in the form of a one-time funding  increase for DOD’s homeowners assistance program, which provides housing  payments to these military families to  help with relocation. H.R. 3590 clarifies  that military families will not be taxed  on these additional benefits.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this  is a  good bill, and I’m proud to lend my  support to it today. I’m hopeful the  Senate will quickly approve the legislation so the President can sign it into  law. We owe our men and women in  uniform, as well as the families that  support them, nothing less.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

1662,29,2009-10-07,Mr. TANNER.," Mr. Speaker, the bill  has been explained. May I just simply  say this is a bill that is completely bipartisan and, more importantly, or as  importantly, fully paid for. It protects  the Foreign Service officers, the military and the intelligence community  members who may have been ordered  or otherwise sent  from their homes  under the Homebuyers Act, and it protects their rights thereunder. Important. It should be done. They are risking not only their  lives, but often,  many times their liberties.  And so I want to thank everyone  who’s worked on this bill. Mr. CAMP,  thank you, and others, for bringing to  the floor a bipartisan, paid-for bill that  will protect the rights of the Homebuyers Act of our Foreign Service officers, our military, and the intelligence  community.  ",2009
1663,29,2009-10-07,Mr. CAMP.," At this time I yield 2  minutes to a distinguished member of  the Ways and Means Committee, the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. GINNY  BROWN-WAITE).  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 3590, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009.  The  first-time  homebuyer  credit  gives qualifying consumers a tax refund of up to $8,000 when buying a primary residence. So far, over 1.4 million  Americans have  taken advantage of  this  credit. However,  the men  and  women serving in our Nation’s Armed  Forces are largely unable to take advantage of this credit. Why? Because  the current  law  requires consumers  who utilize the first-time homebuyers’  tax credit to repay the credit if they  move from the primary residence within 36 months of the closing. This 3-year  residency  requirement  disqualifies  many military personnel from taking  advantage of the tax credit.  Following the call of the military,  armed services members regularly relocate duty stations, thus resulting in an  immediate  recapture  of  the  credit.  That’s  just not  fair  to our Armed  Forces. Our military personnel, Foreign  Service  officers,  intelligence  agents and their families should not be  penalized for required moving in service to our Nation. H.R. 3590 eliminates  the inequities in the first-time homebuyers tax credit by waiving the 36-  month  requirement  for  servicemembers, Foreign Service officers, and intelligence agents who must sell their  homes in connection with Federal orders relating to official extended duty.  With over 116,000 veterans living in  my district, I’m keenly aware of issues  that are of  interest to our military  servicemembers. While we can never do  enough to thank our men and women  in uniform for their service, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act  of 2009 is one way that we can demonstrate America’s commitment to our  troops while they are serving.  I  thank my  colleague  from New  York, Mr. RANGEL, for introducing this  bill. And I’m proud to cosponsor it, and  I urge its support. Hopefully the Senate will act in an expeditious manner  so that we can truly make sure that  this tax benefit extends to our servicemembers.  ",2009

1671,36,2009-10-07,Mr. NYE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to thank Chairman FILNERfor his leadership on this issue and also Chairman  MICHAUD. I am proud to rise in support  of this  legislation that will bring a  commonsense solution to a long-standing problem.  For far too long, the VA health care  system has been plagued with budgets  that were too little, too late. Insufficient funding for veterans’ health care  leads to waiting lists, delayed care and  veterans being turned away from VA  hospitals  and  clinics. Underfunding  threatens the very quality of care that  the VA has worked so hard to achieve.  But just as important as how much  funding the VA receives is when the  VA receives that  funding. With  just  three exceptions, the budget has been  late for 20 of the past 23 years, this  year included. When funding is late,  the budget levels are uncertain, and it  makes it harder to plan ahead for the  needs of our veterans.  H.R. 1016 will solve this problem by  authorizing VA’s medical care budget  in advance. Moreover, to help ensure  that we have sufficient funding, H.R.  1016 adds transparency to the budget  process by requiring the Government  Accountability Office to audit the VA’s  internal budget. This way, we can see if  the budget request accurately reflects  the projected needs of our veterans.  Mr. Speaker, the commitment of our  men and women in uniform does not  stop at the end of the fiscal year nor do  the needs of our veterans. Our soldiers,  sailors,  airmen  and marines  stand  ready to defend our Nation whenever  they are called upon. We can plan for  the  future  security  of  the United  States  because we know  that  our  troops will be there. We owe them that  same commitment in return.  The passage of this legislation is critical to ensure that our veterans receive  their benefits on time, and it will allow  the VA to plan ahead to meet the needs  of the new veterans returning home  each day from Iraq and Afghanistan.  No longer can we allow the care of our  Nation’s veterans to be affected by the  unstable budgetary process.  I am proud to support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the  same.  ",2009
1672,36,2009-10-07,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," I will continue to reserve  the balance of my  time, Mr.  Speaker.  ",2009
1673,36,2009-10-07,Mr. FILNER.," I yield myself 30 seconds  just to say something I  forgot  when I introduced the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. MICHAUD).  In this process, there was a time  when the executive branch seemed to  waiver in its commitment to this effort, and Mr. MICHAUD’s tenacity and  his steadfast support of this makes  sure that we continue down this path.  I want to thank him for doing that.  I yield as much time as he may consume  to Mr. HARE from  Illinois, a  former member of the committee, who  I wish was still on our committee.  ",2009
1674,36,2009-10-07,Mr. HARE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  strong support of H.R. 1016, the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and  Transparency Act of 2009. I would like  to thank Chairman FILNER for introducing this very important bill.  In the 110th Congress, we gave the  VA its largest funding increase in 77  years, and we gave it to them on time;  but sadly, punctual VA funding has not  always been the case. The VA received  its annual funding for health care programs late in 19 of the last 22 years.  This record of tardiness is deplorable.  With the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the time to fix the broken  system is now.  Late funding is more than a missed  deadline.  It  is  a  veteran  with  posttraumatic stress disorder who cannot access the treatment that he or she  needs. It’s an injured hero who must  wait for a prosthetic. It is the VA in  disarray at a time when our wounded  warriors are counting on the Department’s services. That is why, in the  last Congress, I introduced the Assured  Funding for Veterans Health Care Act.  Like the bill I introduced, advance  appropriations is a means to an end.  That end is ensuring veterans receive  the best care possible from a VA that  has access to timely, sufficient, and  predictable resources. The legislation  we are considering today will do just  that. It will allow the VA to effectively  budget and manage its health care programs and services, meaning  it can  hire the appropriate number of doctors,  nurses, clinicians, and support staff to  meet the demand for high-quality medical care  for our Nation’s veterans.  Anything less is unacceptable.  I would also like to acknowledge and  commend Chairmen OBEYand EDWARDS  for their strong proactive leadership in  putting in an advance appropriation for  VA health care in the fiscal year 2010  Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill. The bill that  we’re voting on today has been slightly  amended  from a version which  the  House passed earlier this Congress by a  margin of 409–1. I enthusiastically support H.R. 1016.  I want to once again thank Chairman  BOBFILNERfor drafting a bill that will  ensure  that  the VA has  sufficient,  timely, and predictable funding.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues  to support this legislation.  ",2009
1675,36,2009-10-07,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, this  compromise agreement will finally provide advance appropriations beginning  for the fiscal year 2011 for three VA  medical accounts. Although  I prefer  the House version of the bill, I think  this is a great advancement, and I will  congratulate the chairman and members of the VA Committee for a great  job.  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R.  1016, as amended.  I yield back the balance of my time.  GENERALLEAVE  ",2009

It is an incredibly good solution to what we saw as a real problem.  It took creativity,  it took commitment, and it took sticktuitiveness to  get this done.

Udall Foundation  and honors the life of Stewart Udall.  The Morris K. Udall Foundation is an  independent Federal agency based in  Tucson, Arizona, which operates exceptional educational programs focused on  developing  leadership  on  environmental  issues and Native American  issues. It also includes the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, the only program within the  Federal Government  focused entirely  on preventing, managing, and resolving  Federal environmental conflicts.  The  legislation today will enhance  the  foundation’s programs and operations, and at the same time honor one  of the greatest public servants and conservationists  in history, Stewart L.  Udall, by adding his name to the foundation of his late brother, Morris K.  Udall.  The Udall Foundation was  established by Congress  in 1992. Initially,  the foundation’s mission was to provide  educational  opportunities  for  studies related to the environment and  Native American  tribal  policy  and  health care.  In 1998, Congress amended the Udall  Foundation’s  enabling  legislation  to  add a new mission: resolving conflicts  related to the environment, natural resources, and public lands through services including mediation, facilitation,  and training. The work of the Udall  Foundation has become even more important  today as  the Nation  seeks  long-term responses to climate change,  sustainable energy supplies, and a sustainable economy for all Americans.  Through its education programs, the  Udall Foundation identifies and educates tomorrow’s leaders in fields that  are  critical  to  the  energy,  climate  change, and economic issues that face  our Nation. These programs include:  The premier college scholarship and  doctoral fellowship for studies related  to the environment and a scholarship  for Native Americans studying tribal  policy or health care.  The Native American Congressional  Internship Program that has provided  to many of our offices over 150 young  Native American  leaders  that have  been part of that internship program.  The Native Nations  Institute  for  Leadership, Management, and Policy  that provides both governance and economic development resources for tribal  nations as they develop their own self-  determination and  fully develop the  sovereignty that they have.  The Parks in Focus Program which  connects underserved youth to nature  through the art of photography and instilling them with a long-last understanding and appreciation for our national parks and other public lands.  b1615  I think it is very appropriate for Congress to provide solid support for the  Udall Foundation and very important  programs  through  this  legislation,  while at the same time recognizing the  unsurpassed contributions of Stewart  Udall by adding his name to the foundation’s title. Stewart Udall served in  the House of Representatives with distinction  from  1955,  representing  an  area that included what is now my district, until he was appointed Secretary  of the Interior  in 1961 by President  John F. Kennedy.  As Secretary of the Interior, Stewart  Udall had an unmatched record of environmental  leadership, overseeing the  creation of 4 national parks, 6 national  monuments, 8 national sea shore and  lake shores, 9 recreation areas, 20 historic sites, and 56 wildlife refuges. He  continued  to make  substantial contributions to environmental and Native  American policy as a lawyer and author following his tenure at the Interior.  For these reasons, I believe that the  legislation deserves the support of the  House.  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I yield  the remainder of my time to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. CASTOR) and  ask unanimous consent that she manage the remainder of the bill.  ",2009

1688,533,2009-10-07,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself as much time as I may  consume. I rise today  in support of  H.R. 1035, a bill that amends the Morris  K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in  National Environmental Policy Act.  The Morris K. Udall Foundation was  created by Congress in 1992 to honor  Mr. Udall’s 30 years of public service.  The Foundation was created to help  educate new generations to protect the  environment. The Foundation works to  increase the awareness of our Nation’s  natural resources, foster a greater recognition and understanding of the role  of the environment and the development of our Nation, and through the  U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, provide for mediation  and other services to resolve environmental  disputes  involving  Federal  agencies.  The Foundation operates several educational programs. The Morris K. Udall  scholarship program awards approximately 80 merit-based scholarships of  about $5,000 each year. It also supports  about 12 Native Americans or Alaskan  natives every summer for a 10-week bipartisan congressional internship program.  Finally, the foundation supports two  fellows every year in a doctoral program whose research focuses on environmental policy.  As we noted when this passed the  House this summer, the legislation before us honors Stewart L. Udall’s service to the Nation by adding his name to  the foundation, making it the Morris  K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation. Mr. Udall served in Congress and  the administration, and then continued  his work for the environment in the  private sector. I would like to point  out that there  is one difference between this bill and the version passed  by the House in July. The other body  removed  the  authorization  level  of  ‘‘such sums,’’ thereby leaving the authorization of these programs at $40  million, which is current law.  Finally, I would like to note this bill  is being amended by the House to include the Travel Promotion Act, which  creates a corporation to promote travel  in  the United States. My colleague  from Missouri, Mr. BLUNT, a member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee,  will speak to these provisions. But let  me just say that I’m glad that we are  acting to promote tourism in this economic downturn. Attractions like the  Great  Smoky Mountains  National  Park, the most visited park in America, Dollywood, Jonesboro, the oldest  town  in  Tennessee,  and  Sycamore  Shoals historic  site  in my district  stand to benefit greatly from increased  tourism.

And  I feel good about that.  And I, too, look forward to our continued efforts together as we approach  problems—as you know and I do—that  really face people with the jurisdiction  that we have that comes under this  portfolio.

I wanted to bring the attention of my  colleagues to an important matter of  health and safety. And when we talked  about the child nutrition program and  its  extension,  our Nation’s  schoolchildren and the people who work with  them on a daily basis are faced with a  growing public health concern.

You’ve got school food service workers who face a very difficult dilemma  in trying to do their jobs. They don’t  have any paid sick leave. These are  people without any leave. So there’s  thousands of food service workers who  pose a real risk to the health and safety of our Nation’s kids. And the comment is ‘‘show up for work or do not  get paid.’’  So  rather  than  exacerbating  the  problems,  these  workers  can  and  should be part of the solution to ensuring the health and safety of our children. I look forward to working in the  months ahead as Education and Labor  looks to reauthorize their legislation,  and I pledge to work with my colleagues to see if we can provide a minimum and a reasonable standard for  paid sick leave for school service workers.  In the meantime, I am also encouraging the administration to examine  this issue because I think it is a health  problem and the Nation’s well-being  depends on it.  ",2009
1691,554,2009-10-07,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  support of the FY 2010 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration  Appropriations Conference Report, and I commend Chairwoman DELAURO for bringing this  bipartisan legislation to the floor today.  The FY 2010 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration Appropriations bill makes key investments in protecting our public health, bolstering food nutrition programs, and conserving our natural resources.  The conference report provides $2.36 billion  for the Food and Drug Administration, which  represents a 15 percent  increase over  last  year. We need to ensure that the FDA has the  necessary tools and resources to fulfill its vital  mission in protecting the American public so  that FDA-regulated products,  like  food, are  safe. This important investment in the FDA will  help the agency in meeting its mission in protecting the public health.  The $58 billion provided  for  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will help  low income and elderly Americans struggling  with rising food costs in this current economic  downturn. In addition, $7.3 billion is provided  for  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC,  to help encourage a healthy pregnancy  for  women and promote a healthy start for their  children.  This  legislation provides $1 billion  for  the  Natural Resources Conservation Service  to  help face the demands for cleaner water, reduced soil erosion, and more wildlife habitat. I  am particularly pleased that almost $4 million  is provided  for Chesapeake Bay  restoration  activities that will provide farmers, landowners,  and communities within the Chesapeake Bay  watershed  technical  assistance  in  implementing  important  conservation  programs  the  this conthe health of  which will help  improve  Chesapeake Bay.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge adoption of  ference report.  ",2009

1694,561,2009-10-07,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DEAL) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2009
1695,561,2009-10-07,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to address this body  about a document that is sometimes  forgotten.  A  document  that  gives  meaning and purpose to what we do in  this body, that in fact is the basis upon  which this body actually exists. And  that is the Constitution of the United  States.  For over two centuries, this document has been the foundation for our  free people. It has become the model  for other governments who have copied  it around the world. And yet too often  it appears that the very document that  is the core of our liberties, the core of  our existence in this representative democracy, is overlooked in this body.  It’s as if it were treated as a document  of antiquity to be given proper respect  in the Library of Congress but to be  paid no attention to in our deliberations here. I think that is quite ironic.  I had a town hall meeting this weekend, and one of my constituents raised  the  issue of the constitutionality of  one of the bills that are pending before  this body. I promised him I would address that issue, and that is what I intend to do very briefly this evening.  When those 56 men met in Philadelphia, they understood the significance  of trying to write a document that controlled the actions of legislative and  executive bodies. And they did a very  good job of it. Over these two centuries  plus, there have only been some 27  amendments that have been adopted.  It used to be that when Congress  would  legislate on an  issue that  it  would preface  it with  the constitutional basis upon which the legislation  would be even authorized to be considered. That practice has, unfortunately,  been abandoned. For those who are familiar with our Federal courts, it is  not unlike what a party going into that  court would be required to do, and that  is to specify the basis on which the  Federal court has jurisdiction to consider the issue that is presented to the  court.  I think we should do the same thing  here in this body. We should ask ourselves the question before any piece of  legislation  is even considered, Upon  what basis of the Constitution do we  even have a right to consider to legislate on this subject?  Now, this subject is not just something that I want to talk in generalities about. I think we have a concrete  example of a piece of legislation where  the core issue is that of its constitutionality, and that is the health care  reform legislation.  Now, admittedly, Congress has, under  the commerce clause of the Constitution, reached into many realms of our  activity in this country. But here in  this bill there is one central ingredient,  and that is the mandate on an individual  that  they must  purchase  a  health insurance policy. Now, I think  that is where the unconstitutionality  of that proposition rises to the fore.  And I suggest it for this reason:  First of all, it imposes what is presumed to be a tax if you do not comply.  I think it is very clear under the interpretations of our Constitution  that  Congress cannot impose a tax unless it  first has  the authority under other  parts of the Constitution to regulate  the activity, namely  the  commerce  clause or some other designated ability  to regulate under the enumerated powers of the Constitution. Here there is  no such enumeration. And certainly  buying a health insurance policy, the  requisite of that  is not engaging  in  interstate  commerce.  Somebody  doesn’t go to the doctor to engage in  interstate commerce; they go for their  own health care concerns.  Some would argue, well, we mandate  that people have to have automobile liability insurance. I remind them that  it is a quid pro quo in which the State  issues a driver’s license as a condition  for requiring the mandate of insurance.  We do not issue a license to the citizens of this country to breathe or to  exist. Therefore, by what right do we  have the ability to impose a personal  mandate?  Now, this issue is not new. I want to  quote from a report from the Congressional Budget Office back in 1993 when  they were  considering  the  Clinton  health care proposal, and I quote:  ‘‘A mandate requiring all individuals  to purchase health insurance would be  an unprecedented form of Federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in  the United States.’’  f  ",2009

1699,568,2009-10-07,Mr. AKIN.," Well, you know, gentlemen, a number of you have raised the  point that there’s a whole lot of Americans that are not very thrilled with  this approach of government takeover  of health care. But  let’s  just think  about it for a minute: Why it is that  you had  that  reaction,  2,000 people  come out of nowhere, and they’re all  hotter than hornets about how this is  lousy stuff, we don’t want some bureaucrat rationing our health care.  Let’s  talk  about who might  be  against this bill. First of all, if you’re  an older guy like I am, you’re going to  be worried, because statistically you’re  at the point where they’re saying it’s  not worth it for the government to pay  for you to get your health care.  b2000  So  if you’re an older person, all  they’re going to give you is aspirin and  some pain pills or something. And so if  you’re  an  older  person—you’re  not  going to like this—if you’re an older  person, you’re probably also on Medicare. And you want $500 billion taken  out of Medicare? I  just don’t think  that’s going to be very popular with  some of our older voters.  But let’s say that you’re a different  person. Let’s say that you have a small  business. This bill is going to tax your  small business a whole lot. You’re saying, I’m already struggling. I’m barely  making ends meet. We’ve got a lot of  unemployment  in America.  If  I had  some money, I’d be able to add some  new machines, get my small business  going, and we could help the unemployment. But now you’re going to tax me  to death on a bunch of this socialized  medicine. So the small businessman is  not going to like it, the guy who is pro-  life is not going to like this.  I yield.  ",2009
1700,568,2009-10-07,Mr. BURGESS.,"  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding, because that’s a  very  good  point.  I  had  several  roundtables with small business in my  district over the summer. An 8 percent  payroll tax will be the largest single  tax ever levied upon small businesses  in this country. Think about that for a  minute. We just hit, what, 9.6, 9.7 national unemployment.  ",2009
1701,568,2009-10-07,Mr. AKIN., We’ve got unemployment  that’s just running away. The statistic  almost everybody knows is that I think  it’s pretty close to 79 percent of the  jobs  in America are with companies  with 500 or fewer employees. So small  business employs almost 80 percent of  Americans. And what are we going to  do? We’re going to slam them with an  8 percent tax on top of things right now  with unemployment already at 8 or 9  percent.  ,2009
1702,568,2009-10-07,Mr. BURGESS.," If the gentleman will  further yield, all last month I heard  from small business people either at  home or who came up to Washington to  see me. I heard from a lady who has a  saddle manufacturing plant  in Fort  Worth; I heard  from cardiologists; I  heard from air-conditioner compressor  remanufacturers in my district. I heard  from  literally butchers, bakers, and  candlestick makers,  all  concerned,  yeah, the economy may be doing a little bit better in north Texas. Yeah,  maybe those aren’t wild leaves; maybe  those are in fact green shoots.  I said, Well, are you looking to expand business or add any jobs? No, I am  not, because I don’t know what you’re  doing to me in health care. I’m scared  to death about what you’re going to do  with this energy bill. I haven’t a clue  what you might do with this financial  service reregulation you’re going to do,  and it is too uncertain.  When I look across the horizon, all I  see is the abyss. I cannot possibly add  a job in this environment that Congress  is doing. Forget the economy;  forget the worldwide situation. It  is  what Congress  is doing;  the uncertainty that Congress has now injected  into the small business climate, small  business environment.  They are holding back on adding jobs  in a climate where, otherwise, maybe if  I could find a banker to loan me some  money to do something, I might do it,  but not if I’m going to face an 8 percent payroll tax, not if I’m going to  have to pay more for my energy or, by  the way, pay some sort of premium in  a carbon offset  somewhere at  some  point in the future. And, oh yeah, who  knows what this financial regulation is  going to do to me if I’m a financial  planner.  All kinds of businesses in my district, the multiplier effect of perhaps  those one or two jobs in every small  business spread out across my district,  spread out across my State, spread out  across the country; and is it any wonder that our unemployment rate is 9.7  percent?  ",2009
1703,568,2009-10-07,Mr. AKIN.," The sad thing is that, to a  large degree, we’re doing  it to ourselves with this kind of overkill legislation. This almost looks like somebody has got a solution looking for a  problem to justify it.  I notice that we’re joined by my good  friend, Congressman FORTENBERRY. I’d  like to yield some time to you so you  can be part of our discussion.  I have  to  say  that Congressman  FORTENBERRYis highly respected. He is  one of these level-headed kind of decent guys. Everybody likes him.  You’ve got to have some people in  your district talking to you about this.  What are you hearing, Congressman?  ",2009
1704,568,2009-10-07,Mr. FORTENBERRY.," Well,  first of  all, thank you for your comments, and  it’s a pleasure to join you this evening.  I didn’t have the benefit of the conversation in its fullness before joining  you just a moment ago, but I would  like to try to make a contribution to  what you’re saying, if you can yield a  few minutes to me.  ",2009
1705,568,2009-10-07,Mr. AKIN.," I yield. We’re basically enjoying having a conversation here. A  little bit like going to dinner with your  you  Congressman,  except  the  food,  have to provide that for yourself.  Proceed, please  ",2009
1706,568,2009-10-07,Mr. FORTENBERRY.," Thank you. I  think, if I could reframe this for just a  moment, I think there’s a central question we should all be asking ourselves  on both sides of the aisle, and including  the administration: How do we actually strengthen health care in America? How do we answer a fundamental  question as to reducing cost, improving  health care for all Americans, and protecting vulnerable people?  If you start to frame how we move  forward on appropriate public policies  that improve health care, reduce cost,  and protect our vulnerable people, you  begin to get actually underneath the  reasons that we’re in a circumstance  now where you have a large section of  America that is pretty happy with its  health  care, but generally unhappy  with the rising cost. You have another  section of America that has real problems with gaps of insurance coverage  either because of preexisting conditions or loss of job and an inability to  afford a product individually. That’s a  real problem.  Then you have certain vulnerable  populations who, frankly, end up in the  emergency room a lot of times; whereas, if there were alternative methods of  care, primarily for primary care, that  would reduce that cost as well. So how  do you begin to answer those questions, I think.  One is—and I think there has been a  certain bipartisan focus on this—and  that’s this positive in this overall debate—but it’s the whole issue of health  and wellness.  Our total health care bill  in this  country is about $2.2 trillion. About 75  percent of that is actually due to the  onset of chronic disease. A major portion of  that could actually be prevented or better managed with significant cost reductions.  For instance, some estimates suggest  that 80 percent of cardiovascular disease could actually be prevented or  better managed. Can you imagine the  hundreds of billions of dollars that we  could be saving if we had a cultural  shift in the paradigm of health that  looked at  incentivizing both prevention and wellness? I will give you a few  examples.  In Nebraska, we have a rehabilitation  hospital called Madonna Rehab Hospital, and we actually held a committee hearing, a public hearing in the  field back home on putting the health  back  in health care.  It was a subcommittee of  the Agriculture Committee, which we held back in August.  Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital’s  principal testified they have a 1.7 percent increase in their annual health  care bill over the last 5 years. Incredibly low.  ",2009
1707,568,2009-10-07,Mr. AKIN.,"  Only  1.7,  gentleman?  That’s not very much increase. Most  people’s insurance jumps 20 percent a  year.  ",2009

And it’s been an incredible privilege to work with you. Thank you so  much.  It’s now my privilege to introduce  not only my friend but my next-door  neighbor in Washington, D.C., a woman  who has been a passionate advocate, a  fighter—really you  look  in  the dictionary and look up the word ‘‘fighter’’  and ‘‘passion’’ and SHELLEYBERKLEYis  right there.

1710,575,2009-10-07,Ms. BERKLEY.," Thank you, Congresswoman.  woman DEBBIEWASSERMAN SCHULTZ  I would like to thank both Congressand my dear friend Congressman SUE  MYRICK for leading the charge, and a  special thank you to DEBBIE. She did  mention that we’re next-door neighbors.  And I want to tell you, DEBBIE, I used  to—you know, in the morning before I  start getting ready to come to work—  and I am always at work by 8 o’clock  no matter where I have to be; it’s usually by 8. And I would be sitting at my  dining room table having my cup of  coffee and reading the newspaper, and  at ungodly hours there was DEBBIEgetting into her car, and I couldn’t for the  life of me figure out where she was  going at this hour. I said, Where can  this woman be going?  But then by 8 o’clock I would see her  at whatever meeting we were at. And I  never knew until you made that public  disclosure  of what you were  going  through  and  that  you were  going  through it by yourself, with your loved  ones, but not sharing with your colleagues because you wanted to keep  this personal and not tell people at  that time. And I cannot tell you the  admiration I had for you long before  that, but particularly afterwards.  And, SUE, same thing. I recall distinctly when you were going through  your treatments and how brave you  were during that time, and it’s an inspiration for all of us.  This is a very important piece of legislation, and that’s why I came to the  floor at 9 o’clock in the evening. It’s  particularly personal to me.  There isn’t a woman in my family  that has not died of cancer, of breast  cancer: both my grandmothers, all of  my aunts, my mother. The worst day of  my life is when my sister, Wendy, 47 at  the time, called me up and told me  that she had been diagnosed with cancer. Given the background of my family, listening to this my knees buckled  because I was so fearful of her fate. But  because times have changed and there’s  early detection and better awareness of  this dreaded, horrible disease, horrible  disease, she was able to get the treatment that she needed. They practically  killed her to cure her, but she’s alive  today and doing not only very well but  she  just became a grandmother  last  Friday. And that could not have happened in my mother’s generation or my  grandmothers’  because  they weren’t  aware of what they needed to do in  order to protect themselves.  I am hoping that when we are discussing health care  in this country  that we are able to change the paradigm of how we deliver health care  services to the people that we represent throughout the United States of  America. This is a perfect example of  legislation that is important because it  raises awareness for all women, young  and  old,  but  particularly  younger  women that need to know what to look  for, what to expect, what are the signs,  and what they can do when they suspect that they have the early signs of  cancer.

1826,596,2009-10-07,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I wish  to thank my colleague from Tennessee  for speaking so eloquently and raising  the issues that are on the minds not  just of Senators who are going to have  to vote on this legislation but our constituents all across America—people  who will be directly affected by what  we do here on health care reform.  Yesterday, I came to the floor and I  asked the question: Will we have a  transparent  debate?  This morning,  when I got up and checked my e-mail,  I was delighted to see that eight Democratic Senators have written to the  majority leader, Senator REID, and said  they wanted to have bill language posted on the Internet and a score or cost  by the Congressional Budget Office at  least 72 hours before we are required to  vote on the bill. That is exactly what  we had requested in the Finance Committee, which we  lost strictly on a  party-line vote, an amendment that  would have made that part of the bill.  So I consider that progress. I am delighted that these eight Democratic  Senators have asked the majority leader for that. I think that is a minimum  we should expect  in terms of transparency.  Today, I have a new question, and  that is whether seniors will get to keep  the Medicare benefits they currently  have. Will seniors be able to keep the  Medicare benefits they currently have?  The President has made this a consistent theme, that if you like what  you have, you are going to be able to  keep it. He said in August that if you  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:13 Jan 16, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S07OC9.REC S07OC9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009
1827,617,2009-10-07,Ms. MIKULSKI.,"  Sorry  I  cannot  stand. As  the  Senator  from Ohio  knows, of course, from the chair I am  sitting in I have become an expert on  health care from the wheelchair up. I  broke my ankle coming out of church a  couple weeks ago.  But I would like to ask the Senator  from Ohio to yield for a few questions.  I was taken by the three vignettes he  just told. They are fairly representative of what I get from Maryland. I  would like to talk about the young girl  who had graduated and was deluged  now with the debt of medical bills and  the public option.  Is the Senator familiar with the fact  that there are 47 million uninsured in  our country? Does the Senator from  Ohio know how many of those are between the ages of 18 and 30?  ",2009
1828,617,2009-10-07,Mr. BROWN., I do not know the precise number. But I know it is millions  of them are that age who lose their insurance and do not get insurance and  hope they do not get sick.  ,2009
1829,617,2009-10-07,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Well,  again,  for  background in continuing the discussion. That is 35 percent of the uninsured. So is the Senator aware that if  we followed through with the HELP  Committee bill and the public option  and also private sector competing with  the public option offer, a reasonably no  frills, reasonable cost health insurance  bill for young people, especially young  people’s benefit, that we would cover 35  percent of the uninsured?  ",2009
1830,617,2009-10-07,Mr. BROWN.," I think that is right. As  the Senator knows as a senior member  of the HELP Committee who wrote  some major part of this bill, we are not  only going help those 25-, 28-year-olds  buy insurance through the public option or through private insurance, as  the Senator suggests, we also, if they  are low or moderate income, give them  assistance to be able to afford these  plans.  We are not going to say: Go out and  buy insurance. We are going to keep  the cost down through competition but  also help them with some kind of subsidies to help them buy that insurance.  ",2009
1831,617,2009-10-07,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Can I go to the man  who sands floors for a living, the small  businessperson whom we worry about  who is a self-employed person. Under  the Senator’s concept of a public option, is it true then that whether it is  he or a florist, maybe a real estate  agent, that one of the reasons they  could afford it is they could go into the  health exchange or the public option—  would the public option not only offer  insurance but offer bargaining power  for better prices on insurance? They  could bargain  for better prices  from  hospitals,  doctors,  and  pharmaceuticals?  ",2009
1832,617,2009-10-07,Mr. BROWN., That is exactly right.  ,2009
1833,617,2009-10-07,Ms. MIKULSKI.," In other words, why  would a little guy or gal not only want  to be able to buy in, not only would the  price be exorbitant, or  is  it that  it  would be an Uncle Sam’s club that is  buying things at bulk rate that enables  them to afford the services?  ",2009
1834,617,2009-10-07,Mr. BROWN.," The Senator makes a  terrific point. The man  she  talked  about,  Jason  from  Cleveland, who  sands and refinishes hardwood floors,  he was only in a group of four. You  can’t get good prices in a group of four.  He would be joining a group of millions, whether he chooses a private  company or especially the public option. The Senator knows,  from her  work with the number of Federal employees she has in the Washington, DC,  area and the suburbs of Maryland that  the Veterans’ Administration is able to  negotiate for prescription drugs. The  VA pays probably no more than half as  much for prescription drugs as any of  us going to the drugstore would pay.  The public option will work the same  way. They will use the size. The larger  pool of employees will be able to get  much less expensive hospital, doctor,  and prescription drug costs.  ",2009
1835,617,2009-10-07,Ms. MIKULSKI., I thank the Senator.  ,2009
1836,617,2009-10-07,Mr. BROWN., I thank the Chair and  suggest the absence of a quorum.  ,2009

1839,617,2009-10-07,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, today I  rise to express my concerns about the  PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act.  This bill, which is currently before the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee,  could  have dire consequences on intelligence  collection and investigations. While I  have several concerns about the provisions in this bill and how they will adversely affect the intelligence community, particular attention  should be  given to what our intelligence professionals have said about this bill.  Stakeholders in the intelligence community and the FBI have expressed  concern that this bill will have serious  consequences on the tools those agencies rely on to carry out intelligence  investigations, identify operatives, and  prevent future attacks. These tools are  critical  for detecting and disrupting  terrorist plots in the United States before they become imminent threats to  our safety.  As we have seen  in the past  few  weeks, investigations in Texas, Illinois,  Colorado, and New York confirm what  we already know: there are people in  this country who want to and intend to  harm us. The only way to stop these  terrorist operatives is to give our counterterrorism specialists the tools they  depend on to detect these plots, thwart  attacks, and, if possible, arrest the persons planning these operations.  I am troubled by the fact that we are  rushing this bill through committee  without taking the time to consider  the concerns of those charged with detecting terrorist plots. I urge my colleagues who are ready to stand up and  say this bill will not adversely affect  current and  future  investigations to  stop for a moment and listen to the  professionals who use and need these  tools on a daily basis. Do not just hear  their concerns, really listen to them.  Many  of  these  professionals  were  around before September 11, and they  remember how difficult it was to act  quickly to collect basic  information  about terrorists.  Three provisions of  the PATRIOT  Act are set to expire on December 31,  2009. These are roving wiretaps; business records access, also referred to as  section 215 business records; and the  lone wolf provision. At this time, the  lone wolf provision has yet to be used.  It was  created  in  response  to  the  Moussaoui case. The provision amended FISA’s definition of an ‘‘agent of a  foreign power’’ to include any person,  other than a U.S. person, who ‘‘engages  in international terrorism or activities  in preparation therefore.’’  The expanded definition allows the  government to obtain a FISA, Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act,  court  order to surveil a non-U.S. person who  has no known ties to a group or entity.  Congress passed this lone wolf provision because it was concerned that previous FISA definitions did not cover  unaffiliated  individuals—or those  for  whom no  affiliation  can  be  established—who, nonetheless, engage or are  preparing to engage  in  international  terrorism.  FBI Director Mueller has asked specifically  that  this authority be extended so if the FBI comes across another  ‘‘Moussaoui,’’ there will be no  doubt that the FBI can intercept that  target’s communications. This seems  reasonable to me. We would not tell a  police officer he had to give up his gun  simply because he has not used it yet,  would we?  The other two provisions set to expire are roving wiretaps and business  records searches. These tools are extremely important in the FBI’s investigative work, and the FBI has a solid  track record of using them too. From  2004 through 2008, the FBI has obtained  236 orders  from  the FISA court  to  produce business records. The business  records authority has been exceptionally useful in many types of national  security  investigations.  It  routinely  gives the intelligence community important information that can be used  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:13 Jan 16, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S07OC9.REC S07OC9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

1845,624,2009-10-07,Mr.  COBURN.," Madam  President,  America has to ask itself a question  right now. This bill costs $2.8 billion,  and 95 percent of the people will not  feel anything if we don’t do this. But 5  percent will, and I readily admit that.  We are going to take $2.8 billion from  our kids or from future Medicare payments—one way or the other, we are  going to steal it from our kids—to fix  a problem for 5 percent of the people  who are on Medicare or will be on  Medicare.  This is exactly the kind of problem  that the Congress ducks. We are ducking it. We are kicking the can down the  road because we are afraid to do the  right best thing for America.  Let me give a breakdown. First, I  will just say I appreciate the leadership  of the Senator from Montana on the  Finance Committee.  The Social Security Act holds three-  quarters of the beneficiaries harmless  for increases in the Medicare Part B  premium during the years  in which  there is no COLA, as the chairman just  stated. But for the other one-fourth of  the beneficiaries not held harmless, little impact will be felt. According to  the Congressional Research Service,  the majority of this group is comprised  of Medicaid, as the chairman just stated, the vast majority of them, which  covers their premiums anyway. So if  there is a cost transfer, it will be cost-  transferred back to the Federal Government anyway because we pay 67 percent of all the Medicaid costs anyway.  Finally, the remainder of those not  held  harmless—high-income  individuals making over $85,000 a year as an  individual or $170,000 as a couple and  new  beneficiaries  during  their  first  year, for which they will receive Medicare, Social Security, or Medicare Part  B benefits—the vast majority of all  these people have a supplemental policy, so they won’t feel anything.  So what are we doing? We are taking  $2.8 billion—and we may be taking it  from the Medicare Improvement Fund,  which ultimately takes it out of Medicare, or we are going to take it from  our grandkids, and we are not going to  say that we can’t do this. There was no  inflation except  in health care. And  when you look at it, there is actually a  negative number, negative  inflation.  There was actually deflation. Things  roughly cost six-tenths of 1 percent  less this year than last, and those are  the basic necessities of life. And because we don’t have the courage to face  the situations in front of us, we are  just going to kick it down the road.  That is what is wrong. That is why we  find ourselves with $12 trillion worth of  debt, almost now $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. That is why we find  that a child born today has $400,000 in  unfunded liabilities, and by the time  they are 20 years of age they will be responsible for $800,000 worth of debt on  them that they incurred for us.  So I will make two final points. The  heritage of this country is for one generation to sacrifice for the next. This  generation in this body has turned that  upside down, and we are saying to the  next two generations: You sacrifice for  us because we don’t have the courage  to make the hard choices. And the hard  choices have to be made. We are on an  absolutely unsustainable course in this  country financially. Read the papers.  The dollar is under assault. We are dependent on foreign countries to finance  our debt. Our debt will double in the  next 5 years and triple in the next 10.  And now we are playing the political  game of not having a small percentage  of seniors having an increase in cost,  and mainly those who can afford it.  So the question is, take $2.8 billion  from our grandkids, one way or the  other, and protect that 5 percent of the  seniors, including Bill Gates and every  other very rich person in this country,  or do as the Honorable STENYHOYER  said, the majority leader for the Democrats in the House:  I don’t know how many of you can go to  sleep at night worried about whether Ross  Perot can pay his premium, but this will  freeze Ross Perot’s basic premium  from  going up. I think that as well meaning as  this legislation is, it’s not about poor seniors, it’s about politics.  I recognize this can come back and  we will do it, but at this time, for the  good of our country, to restore the heritage of our country, Madam President,  I have to object.  ",2009

1847,624,2009-10-07,Mr. BAUCUS.," Madam President, I regret that the Senator from Oklahoma  feels constrained to object. I will continue to work to see that Medicare  beneficiaries are not unfairly harmed. I  must also say that this is not for the  Ross Perots of the world. There are due  eligibles—there are many people who  are very poor who will be harmed unless this legislation is passed. I might  also say that this bill is paid for, despite the implications to the contrary.  It is paid for with funds already set  aside at an earlier date in the Medicare  Improvement Fund—a  fund that was  set up for just such purposes. So despite the implications about the future  children and grandchildren, the fact is,  this is already paid for in funds previously set aside.

1848,631,2009-10-07,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment, as modified, is as  follows:  (Purpose: To require the Comptroller General to review and audit Federal funds received by ACORN)  On page 203, between lines 23 and 24, insert  the following:  SEC. 533. REVIEW AND AUDIT OF ACORN FEDERAL FUNDING.  (a) REVIEW ANDAUDIT.—The Comptroller  General of the United States shall conduct a  review and audit of Federal funds received by  the Association of Community Organizations  for Reform Now (referred to in this section  as ‘‘ACORN’’) or any subsidiary or affiliate  of ACORN to determine—  (1) whether any Federal funds were misused and, if so, the total amount of Federal  funds involved and how such funds were misused;  (2) what steps, if any, have been taken to  recover any Federal funds that were misused;  (3) what steps should be taken to prevent  the misuse of any Federal funds; and  (4) whether all necessary steps have been  taken to prevent the misuse of any Federal  funds.  (b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after  the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a  report on the results of the audit required  under  subsection  (a),  along  with  recommendations for Federal agency reforms.  ",2009
1849,631,2009-10-07,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  this  amendment relates to an organization  that is controversial—an organization  known as ACORN. We have seen videos  in which the employees of ACORN were  alleged to have said despicable things,  and in fact, on those tapes, did say despicable things. The employees in question have been fired by their organization, and ACORN is being investigated  by several State and Federal agencies  because of their misconduct and potential misuse of government funds.  I am also troubled by the discoveries  of voter registration fraud, and I am  glad that ACORN reported those incidents to authorities. The employees involved have also been fired by ACORN.  The actions by those employees were  not tolerated, and should not be tolerated. They were inexcusable. Anyone  who has broken the law should be held  accountable and,  if necessary, prosecuted.  ACORN deserves much of the criticism it has received for allowing this  type of behavior to happen. However,  although ACORN was clearly wrong,  we are seeing in Congress an effort to  punish ACORN that goes beyond any  experience I can recall in the time I  have been on Capitol Hill. We have put  ourselves—with some of the pending  amendments—in the position of prosecutor, judge, and jury.  Mr. President, I went to one of these  old-fashioned law schools. We believed  that first you have the trial, then you  have the hanging. But, unfortunately,  when  it comes to this organization,  there has been a summary execution  order issued before the trial. I think  that is wrong. In America, you have a  trial before a hanging, no matter how  guilty the party may appear. And you  don’t necessarily penalize an entire organization  because  of  the  sins  or  crimes of a limited number of employees. First, we should find out the facts.  I know ACORN  is unpopular right  now, and much of that scorn they deserve, but ACORN has a number of affiliated  organizations.  Incidentally,  they are not in Illinois. They do not  operate in my State. It is my understanding they have been gone for several years. But they have a number of  affiliated organizations that would be  affected by the approach which has  been  suggested,  by  an  amendment  which is pending on this legislation.  To my knowledge, we have not yet  seen any review or analysis of whether  the misconduct was the work of a few  employees or whether the entire organization and all of its affiliates should  be held responsible. There may well be  entities affiliated with ACORN that are  not at fault and that provide essential  services to low-income communities.  Let’s get to the bottom line. Why has  this  organization  been  treated  differently than others? Why has it been  the focus of attention? This organization focuses on poor people in America.  They have registered over 1 million  voters, and I am sure most people believe those voters are going to vote in  a certain political way. Folks on the  other  side of  the political equation  don’t care for that—1 million voters  voting against them. So they have been  inspiring this effort against ACORN.  Also, over  the years, ACORN has  been involved in many different States  to improve minimum wages for poor  employees—poor people who are trying  to get enough money to keep their  families together. That doesn’t sit well  with a number of businesses, and I am  sure they have increased the anger of a  lot of people over their conduct. They  have also been involved in counseling  people who are about  to  lose  their  homes to  foreclosures, how to avoid  predatory lenders—banks that are unscrupulous.  I am  sure  those banks  don’t care for ACORN either.  So they have made their share of enemies working with and standing up  for poor people across America. They  have certainly made their share of mistakes. We saw that in videotapes, and  we have seen it in other disclosures.  But Congress should not, without careful  consideration, permanently deny  assistance to the thousands of people  and families who have been receiving  ACORN’s legitimate legal help to avoid  predatory lending and foreclosure because of the misconduct of a handful of  employees who have been terminated  by ACORN.  That is why I am proposing that we  get to the bottom of this by having a  thorough investigation; that Congress  direct the Government Accountability  Office to review and report back to us  within 180 days on whether any Federal  funds have been misused by ACORN or  its  affiliates;  and,  if  so,  in what  amounts and in what ways.  This doesn’t stop this administration  from deciding not to use the services of  this organization when it comes to taking the census. The Obama administration announced they were not going to  use this organization. That is within  their right to do. I am not questioning  that decision. But the efforts by Members on the Senate floor have gone far  beyond any agency’s single decision.  They have tried to blackball this organization and say it shouldn’t do any  work of any kind in any capacity before we have thoroughly investigated  the  charges  that have  been  raised  against it.  The report I have called for should  also  identify the steps necessary to  correct any deficiencies, along with an  assessment of whether all necessary  steps have been taken to prevent any  future misuse of Federal  funds. The  GAO will be able to conduct a government-wide review—not just one agency—looking at any funds ACORN or its  affiliates have received from any Federal agency. It will be a complete and  comprehensive  review and  investigation.  I am not excusing ACORN or its employees  for any misconduct. To the  contrary, I think they should be held  accountable, particularly for the misuse of any Federal funds, if it occurred.  But if we get into the business of passing bills and resolutions against unpopular people or organizations, this is  a road we ought to carefully travel.  There are a lot of companies and organizations out there that have received  government funding and that have had  employees commit fraud or other despicable acts.  I found it curious, the level of anger  and the level of interest when it comes  to ACORN. Yet when it turned out that  Kellogg Brown & Root—a subsidiary of  Halliburton, which was a sole-source  contractor during our war in Iraq—was  found to have been involved in conduct  that led to shoddy workmanship and  which cost the life of an American soldier by electrocution and endangered  many others; when this same organization was involved in supplying water  supplies and sources to our troops that  were dangerous; when in fact there was  evidence of sexual harassment, I didn’t  see the same  level of anger coming  from the media or from my colleagues  on the floor of the Senate. No. But  when it comes to ACORN, registering  poor people to vote, then we have to  take action.  We need an approach that can stand  the test of time and the test of justice.  My approach is based on some pretty  fundamental American principles, calling for this GAO study and investigation. First, individuals should be held  accountable for their actions. Second,  organizations—and  I might add corporations too—should be held accountable for the policies they set. Third, organizations  and  corporations  should  not be permanently cut off based on  the actions of  individual employees  who violated the organizational policy  and were fired.  There should be a process for addressing wrongs and moving forward with  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:13 Jan 16, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\S07OC9.REC S07OC9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

1854,18,2009-10-19,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, pretty  much daily over the  last couple of  months when the Senate has been in  session, I have come to the floor to  share letters I have received from people  in  Findlay,  OH—where  I was  today—Toledo, Sandusky, Mansfield,  Lebanon, all over the State. These are  letters from people who want to tell me  why we need health care reform. These  are letters mostly from people I have  not met, people who know we need to  change some things in this country.  What is interesting is that one of the  common  themes  that  run  through  these  letters—in  letter  after  letter  after  letter—is  that people  thought  they had pretty good health insurance.  They were satisfied with their health  insurance. If you asked them a year or  two ago: Do you have good health insurance, they would have probably said  yes. But then they found they had a  child who was diagnosed with a preexisting condition, so they were denied  insurance, or they got sick and they  went above the annual or lifetime cap  on costs they did not even know was in  their insurance policy, so the insurance  company then rescinded them—is the  term they use—there was a rescission  to eliminate or take away their policy,  or they were discriminated against for  other reasons, or in many cases they  lost their job and lost their insurance.  In case after case, these are people  who are mostly middle class, people  playing  by  the  rules,  paying  their  taxes, raising their kids, keeping their  communities  prosperous,  and  they  typically have lost much of what they  had.  I want to share some of these letters  with my colleagues, particularly colleagues who are not so certain, colleagues who still defend the health insurance system and think we do not  need significant change, so that they  would maybe understand some of these  problems a little better.  The first letter is from Wilkins from  Youngstown, which  is  in northeast  Ohio. He writes:  I’m an unemployed  former steel worker  from Youngstown. I’ve been struggling to afford my premiums for COBRA while on unemployment and looking for a job.  COBRA is a bit of a cruel hoax. It is  a good program for people who can afford it. But COBRA is for when you  lose your job that you can keep your  insurance if you pay what you are already paying, plus you pay the employer’s side of the insurance. That is almost impossible to do for most people  who lose their job for a very long period of time. They are only eligible for  COBRA for up to 18 months anyway. He  writes:  Due to a pre-existing condition of high  blood pressure, I had no choice but to continue my coverage under COBRA.  If he had a break in his health care,  if he canceled his health insurance and  tried to get other less expensive insurance, he would have been denied coverage because of his preexisting condition. He writes:  I’m 59 years old and have been working  temporary jobs just to get by, but none offers health insurance. I barely make enough  to afford my blood pressure medication.  I’ve depleted my savings while watching  my unemployment insurance run out.  That  is  something  else  that  this  Chamber must consider. I just saw Senator SHAHEEN from New Hampshire a  moment ago. She has helped lead the  fight on extending unemployment benefits  for people whose  insurance has  run out, something, unfortunately, day  after day we have tried to do here, and  a Republican Senator has stood up and  objected and we have not been able to  push that through yet. Unemployment  insurance makes so much sense with so  many people—from Dayton to Springfield to Chillicothe to Zanesville—who  cannot find a job and have seen their  unemployment insurance run out.  Wilkins writes:  I’m sick of high  insurance premiums. I  worked for 38 years and now I have no health  care coverage.  They threw me away like an old shoe. It’s  me today and it could be anyone tomorrow.  I may not have three years to live until I  receive Medicare if I can’t afford my medicine.  I need health reform now. It just can’t  wait.  One of the other themes that runs  through these  letters  is that people  who are in their late fifties or early  sixties and do not have insurance are  just  praying—praying—they  can  get  enough help and stay well enough, stay  healthy enough so they can make it  until they are 65 and they can get  Medicare.  What does that say? Wilkins  from  Youngstown worked for 38 years. He  lost his job because of what has happened in the steel industry. He cannot  afford COBRA. He cannot afford his  blood pressure medicine. He is working  part-time jobs just to try to get by. He  is praying he can get to 65 so he can  get health insurance under Medicare—  a program that looks a lot like the  public option would  look  if we pass  that legislation in the next couple of  months.  Robin from Cuyahoga County, in the  Cleveland area, writes:  My son just graduated from college and his  coverage under his Dad’s employer is coming  to an end.  While he has found an entry level job, he is  not currently a full-time employee and does  not have health insurance.  He is incredibly healthy, but when he was  in high school he was diagnosed with a heart  condition, which could require surgery as he  ages, but not  for decades  [his doctor believes].  As my son was searching for insurance, he  was honest about this condition. Each company he called denied him.  So now, a 22-year-old with no history of  any illness—  A young man, 4 or 5 years older than  the pages who sit in front of us—  but who at some point in the future might  need medical support, can’t get health insurance.  Instead of creating a system that provides  him incentives and proactive monitoring of  his condition—  To keep him as healthy as we can—  we have a system that drives him away,  doesn’t encourage preventive measures, and  ends up costing everyone more. I encourage  you to take every action possible to put an  end to health insurance companies denying  coverage for preexisting conditions. We need  a system that puts an emphasis on preventive care.  Robin is right about her son. Under  our health care bill, as the Presiding  Officer from Alaska understands, anyone who chooses to can stay on his  mother’s or father’s health insurance  until reaching the age of 26. So her son  would have  4 more years on  their  health care plan under our bill that we  are going to debate on this floor in the  next few weeks. Robin’s son would be  able to keep his insurance until he was  able, down the line, to get a better job  with insurance. Obviously, under our  bill, he is going to have access to insurance anyway. But one of the things to  help young people as they go into the  workforce—maybe they are  living at  home, just moved out of the house, finishing college or coming home  from  the military, but so many young people  lose insurance because they are working at often low-paying jobs that don’t  provide insurance for their employees.  Beatrice from Summit County, the  Akron area, writes:  As  a  recent  retiree  due  to  economic  downsizing, I am left to purchase an expensive insurance plan.

Something  very  interesting  about  Rabbi Luski: He was born in Havana,  Cuba,  on November  2,  1949, which  makes him, in just a couple of days, 60  years old. But he left Cuba 50 years ago  at the age of 10 and came to the United  States with his  family. Rabbi Luski  has with him this morning his mother,  his father, and his sister.  Madam Speaker, it is an honor for  me to welcome Rabbi Luski to the  House this morning, along with his  wife, Joanne, and one of his four children, Rachel.  Thank you  for your  inspiring  life  story, Rabbi, and for your devotion to  your synagogue and to the people of  our community and for your friendship  of many, many years.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2996,  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,  ENVIRONMENT,  AND  RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2010  Mr. DICKS submitted the following  conference report and statement on the  bill (H.R. 2996) making appropriations  for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2010,  and for other purposes:  CONFERENCEREPORT(H.

1863,113,2009-10-28,Mr.  KUCINICH.," Madam  Speaker,  health care is a basic right in a democracy and a moral responsibility of our  government consistent with the preamble and the Constitution itself; yet  we are being told that it’s not possible  to have the kind of single-payer health  system which every industrialized democracy in the world has.  We compromised single-payer with a  public option. We’re being asked to  compromise a public option with negotiated rates.  In conference, we’ll be  asked to compromise negotiated rates  with a trigger.  In all of this, in each and every step,  the insurance companies win. They get  $900 billion in new taxpayer subsidies.  They get to raise their premiums, increase  their  copays  and  their  deductibles, while the public is forced  to pay for private insurance, and the  insurance companies win big.  If this is the best we can do, then it’s  time to ask ourselves whether the two-  party system is truly capable of representing  the  American  people  or  whether it’s become so compromised by  special interests that it can’t even protect the health of our own people.  This is a moment of truth for the  Democratic Party in particular. Will  we stand for the people or for the insurance companies? Will we have a true  public option or will we be co-opted?  f  THE LIBERTY TREE AXED BY THE  FEDERAL  COMMUNICATIONS  COMMISSION  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009
1864,113,2009-10-28,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, talk  radio today is like the Liberty Tree in  Revolutionary War times.  The first Liberty Tree was in Boston  where the Sons of Liberty would gather  around a large elm tree in the public  square. They would  talk about  the  issues of the day and voice their political opinions. Anyone could speak. But  the British military cut down the Liberty Tree because colonists spoke out  against taxes and the King.  Now it sounds like the redcoats over  at the FCC are trying to put the ax to  the Liberty Tree of free speech again.  They  say  they need  to protect  the  American people from hearing things  that are  just  too  controversial. So  their answer is to control the speech  content of those radio rebels. The redcoats at the FCC say they must determine what the masses hear.  Mr. Speaker, the notion that anyone  in the Federal Government has the  right to censor political speech is an  affront to a free people. The Constitution protects political speech because  it’s sacred. We defeated the British because they wanted to control speech,  and now it’s time for those who still  believe in the First Amendment to defy  the redcoats at the FCC.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  INTRODUCING LOCOMOTIVE TAX  CREDIT  (Mrs. DAHLKEMPER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2009
1865,113,2009-10-28,Mrs. DAHLKEMPER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to announce that I am introducing new legislation to create and  save valuable manufacturing jobs and  support  our Nation’s  rail  transportation industry.  The Locomotive Fleet  Investment  and Tax Credit Act of 2009 creates a 30  percent tax credit to encourage the  purchase,  sale,  and manufacture  of  long-haul  freight,  passenger,  and  switch locomotives.  The  locomotive  industry  in  the  United  States  provides more  than  125,000 direct jobs and supports thousands more. This tax credit will create  jobs by helping boost the sale of freight  long haul, passenger, and switch locomotives by making  fleet  investment  more affordable for our Nation’s rail  companies.  In addition to saving and creating  jobs, my bill will help put more efficient, cleaner-burning locomotives in  service, which can lower air pollution  in the long term.  I urge my colleagues to support my  bipartisan  legislation to create  jobs,  support manufacturing, and enhance  our national rail system.  f  A HEALTHY DOLLAR WILL  PROMOTE A HEALTHY ECONOMY  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker,  the Democrat Big Government agenda in Washington is destroying jobs.  Every dollar borrowed and spent by  this Democrat majority, a total of $1.4  trillion this year alone, threatens the  value of our currency.  Among the negative consequences of  a weak dollar is the increased costs to  American families for goods and services, especially gas to run cars and  businesses. CQ Weekly reports money  going into commodities instead of the  dollar drives up oil prices. Along with  the majority’s refusal to allow for the  exploration of more American oil and  natural gas, the decline of the value of  the dollar  leads to rising oil prices.  This is painful to struggling families.  It costs jobs and undercuts our economy.  We must restore  fiscal sanity. We  cannot borrow and spend our way to  prosperity, a devastating truth with  the lack of jobs created by the Democrats nearly $1 trillion porkulus bill.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  THE HEALTH CARE BILL  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

GENERALLEAVE  f  NATIONAL METASTATIC BREAST  CANCER AWARENESS DAY  ,2009
1868,120,2009-10-28,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 787) expressing support for designation of October 13, 2009,  as National Metastatic Breast Cancer  Awareness Day.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 787  Whereas metastatic breast cancer refers to  Stage IV breast cancer when cancer cells  travel from the breast, either through the  bloodstream or the  lymphatic system, to  other parts of the body, including the bones,  liver, lungs, or brain, and continue to grow  in their new location;  Whereas an estimated 192,370 women and  1,910 men in the United States will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and 62,280  women will be diagnosed with in situ breast  cancer;  Whereas nearly 30 percent of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will develop Stage  IV  advanced  or metastatic  breast cancer;  Whereas in developing countries, the majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed with advanced stage or metastatic disease;  Whereas the statistic that 155,000 women  and men are presently living with metastatic  breast cancer in the United States underscores the immediate need for increased public awareness;  Whereas there currently  is no cure  for  metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic  breast cancer frequently involves trying one  treatment after another with the goal of extending the best quality of life as possible;  Whereas scientists and researchers are conducting  important  research  projects  to  achieve breakthroughs in metastatic breast  cancer research;  Whereas metastatic breast cancer is rarely  discussed during Breast Cancer Awareness  Month, however those living with the disease  should never feel isolated or ignored;  Whereas metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day emphasizes the urgent need  for  new, targeted breast cancer treatments that  will provide a high quality of life and long  life expectancy for patients by making Stage  IV cancer a chronic, but not fatal disease;  Whereas the House of Representatives is an  institution that can raise awareness in the  general public and the medical community  of breast cancer; and  Whereas October 13, 2009, would be an appropriate  date  to  designate  as National  Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) supports the designation of National  Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day;  (2) encourages all people  in the United  States to become more informed and aware  of metastatic breast cancer; and  (3) respectfully requests the Clerk of the  House to transmit a copy of this resolution  to the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network.

1872,120,2009-10-28,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I  rise  today  in  strong  support of  House Resolution 787. This resolution  expresses support for designating October 13, 2009, as National Metastatic  Breast Cancer Awareness Day.  Metastatic breast cancer  refers  to  stage IV breast cancer, the most advanced stage of this form of cancer. At  this point, cancer cells have spread beyond the breast and underarm lymph  nodes to other areas of the body. Sadly,  there is no cure for breast cancer once  it has reached this stage.  Breast cancer  is  the  second most  commonly diagnosed cancer in women.  The National Institutes of Health estimates that nearly 195,000 new cases  will be diagnosed in 2009, the majority  of which occur among women. Nearly  30 percent of women diagnosed with  early stage breast cancer will develop  metastatic breast cancer; and despite  this  startling  statistic,  advanced  breast cancer is rarely discussed during  National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month.  This resolution supports designation  of National Metastatic Breast Cancer  Awareness Day. It encourages all people  in the U.S. to become more  informed and aware of metastatic breast  cancer and requests that the Clerk of  the House transmit a copy of this resolution to the Metastatic Breast Cancer  Network.  Earlier  this  month,  my  subcommittee held  a hearing  on  four  pieces of legislation that focus on prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment  of breast cancer. During this hearing,  we heard from four of my colleagues  who have sponsored legislation to address  this  important  health  issue.  Those are Congressman NADLER, Congresswoman DELAURO, who is also the  sponsor of this resolution today, Congresswoman WASSERMANSCHULTZ, and  Congresswoman CASTOR. We also heard  testimony from a number of advocacy  groups and the National Cancer Institute.  Mr. Speaker, this hearing and the  resolution before us today underscore  the importance of early detection of  breast cancer and ensuring that, once  diagnosed, women  receive  the  best  quality treatment available. As House  Resolution  787 highlights,  it’s  especially  important  that women with  metastatic breast cancer feel supported  rather than feeling isolated or ignored.  As National Breast Cancer Awareness  Month draws to a close, I would like to  take this opportunity to comment on  the  important  issues raised with respect to the experience of breast cancer  patients  in today’s medical environment. These patients and many others  lack access to preventive services that  are recommended by experts. Many patients  lack coverage of the medical  care that they need. That’s precisely  why we are hard at work trying to pass  health reform legislation that will improve access to quality and affordable  health care for every American.  If  enacted,  America’s  Affordable  Health Choices Act of 2009, currently  H.R. 3200, will make dramatic improvements in our efforts to battle breast  cancer. Specifically, it will provide affordable access to insurance. H.R. 3200  would prohibit insurers from excluding  patients or charging higher premiums  because of preexisting conditions.  It  would offer protection against high  out-of-pocket  costs  by  limiting  deductibles and copayments and precluding insurance companies from establishing limits on annual or lifetime  benefits. H.R. 3200 would also prohibit  insurers  from rescinding or dropping  insurance  policies  on  the  basis  of  health status.  This bill would also provide coverage  of  preventive  services  in Medicare,  Medicaid, and within the newly established Health Insurance Exchange, free  of cost sharing. This means that services like mammograms would be available free of copays. Early detection and  treatment can help reduce the number  of patients who ever get to stage IV  while we continue our efforts to find a  cure for those who do.  I am pleased to join my colleagues  today  in  raising  awareness  about  breast cancer, and particularly stage  IV breast cancer.  Of course I want to thank, in particular,  the gentlewoman  from Connecticut,  Congresswoman  and my colleague  from New Jersey,  Congressman LOBIONDO, for their leadership.  Let me  just  say about Congresswoman DELAURO, she has been basically a champion on every aspect of  breast cancer since I’ve been here. I  think, really, without her efforts, we  would not have gone as far as we have  in terms of providing meaningful research and treatment. So it’s certainly  no surprise that she is the prime sponsor of this resolution today.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

RES. 783  Whereas from September 15, 2009, through  October 15, 2009, the United States celebrates  Hispanic Heritage Month;  Whereas the presence of Hispanics in North  America predates the founding of the United  States, and, as among the first to settle in  the New World, Hispanics and their descendants have had a profound and lasting influence on the history, values, and culture of  the United States;  Whereas since the arrival of the earliest  Spanish settlers more than 400 years ago,  millions of Hispanic men and women have  come to the United States  from Mexico,  Cuba, and other Caribbean regions, Central  America, South America,  and Spain,  in  search of freedom, peace, and opportunity;  Whereas Hispanic-Americans have contributed throughout the ages to the prosperity  and culture of the United States;  Whereas the Bureau of the Census now  lists Hispanic-Americans as the largest ethnic minority within the United States with a  population of 46,900,000, comprising 15 percent of the Nation’s total population;  Whereas according to the Bureau of the  Census, 16 States have at least a half-million  Hispanic residents, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,  Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New  Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington;  Whereas according to the Bureau of the  Census, Hispanics are the largest minority  group in 20 States, including Arizona, California,  Colorado,  Connecticut,  Florida,  Idaho,  Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode  Island,  Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming;  Whereas according to the Bureau of the  Census, there are 1,600,000 Hispanic-owned  businesses operating in areas including construction, administrative and support, waste  management and remediation services, and  retail and wholesale trade that generated  $222,000,000,000 in revenue in 2002, up 19 percent from 1997;  Whereas according to the Bureau of the  Census, the rate of growth of Hispanic-owned  businesses between 1997 and 2002 tripled to 31  percent compared with the national average  of 10 percent for all businesses;  Whereas Hispanic-Americans serve in all  branches of the United States Armed Forces  and have fought valiantly in every war in  the history of the United States;  Whereas according to the Bureau of the  Census, there are 1,100,000 Hispanic veterans  of the United States Armed Forces;  Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest  United States military distinction, awarded  since the Civil War for  ‘‘conspicuous gallantry and  intrepidity at the risk of  life  above and beyond the call of duty’’;  Whereas 43 men of Hispanic origin have  earned this distinction;  Whereas many Hispanic-Americans  are  dedicated public servants, holding posts at  the highest levels of government, including  Cabinet Secretaries, Members of the House  of Representatives, the Senate, and the Supreme Court; and  Whereas Hispanic-Americans have a deep  commitment to faith, family, and community, an enduring work ethic, and a perseverance to succeed: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) recognizes Hispanic Heritage Month;  (2) celebrates the vast contributions of Hispanic-Americans to the strength and culture  of the United States; and  (3) encourages the people of the United  States to observe Hispanic Heritage Month  with appropriate programs and activities.

1879,134,2009-10-28,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join my colleagues  today  in support of  this  resolution  supporting National Adoption Day and Month.  I join in recognizing all of the children in foster  care awaiting loving adoptive families as well  as the many caring adults who have opened  their hearts and homes  to  take  in  foster or  adopted children.  During 2007 an estimated 783,000 children  were served by the foster care system, with  494,000 children  in care at  the end of  the  year,  including 12,236  in my home State of  Georgia.  In 2006 across  the U.S., 50,941  adoptions were completed with public child  welfare agency involvement. Significantly, the  rate of adoption  from  foster  care has  increased from 5.5 percent in 1995 to 10 percent  in 2006. That  improvement has been  driven by specific policies—including the landmark Adoption  and Safe Families Act  of  1997—designed to increase the rate of adoption.  While  that  is welcome progress,  there  is  more work to be done. Congress took additional steps last year with the passage of bipartisan legislation designed to promote more  adoption, especially of children in foster care.  As that law, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, is  implemented, I look forward to reviewing the  continued progress we will hopefully be making in improving the lives of children. When it  comes to promoting more adoption instead of  more  foster care, we certainly have a solid  track record to build on, and cause for optimism.  Beyond the legislation now in place, I call  on Congress and the American people to continue working to improve educational opportunities for foster youth, as for all youth. Foster  youth  face particularly high hurdles  in graduating from high school on time, or even at all.  The reasons are many, including the multiple  home placements that often cause young people  in  foster care  to bounce not  just  from  home to home but also from school to school.  Overcoming these challenges is a key goal of  last year’s legislation, and one that will take  the concerted efforts of many in the child welfare and education communities, in addition of  course to the dedication of young people and  their foster and adoptive parents. Giving each  young person a solid chance of success in life  starts with ensuring each and every student  finishes at least high school and has the basic  skills  to  find and keep a stable, well-paying  job.  I urge all Members to support this resolution, and work with the many dedicated faith-  based and other groups in their districts who  promote adoption not only in November, but in  every month of the year. We should all work  toward the day when every child will be in a  safe and loving permanent home, either with  their own parents or, if they cannot adequately  care for them, with loving adoptive parents.  Along the way, it is right to recognize both  those who have already opened their hearts  and homes to these special young people, as  well as  those who will do so  in  the  future.  They deserve our thanks and admiration for  the tremendous commitment of love and devotion they show every day.  ",2009
1880,134,2009-10-28,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Resolution 831 to support the goals and ideals  of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. This resolution seeks to promote  awareness of adoption and  the  foster care  system and remind all of us of the importance  that adoption plays  in  the  lives of countless  Americans across the country.  Today  there are nearly half a million children in foster care in the United States with  roughly 130,000 waiting for families to adopt  them. The awareness and encouragement that  National Adoption Day and Month brings have  helped numerous children find loving families.  It is expected that 4,500 foster care children  will be adopted this year on National Adoption  Day which takes place on November 21.  Mr. Speaker, a loving family can have a lifelong impact on a child, and it is important that  we acknowledge the sacrifices and celebrate  the importance that every party in the adoption  process has.  I encourage my colleagues  to  join me today in supporting House Resolution  831 so that we can continue to recognize the  on-going efforts of America’s adoptive families  and their adopted sons and daughters.

1893,148,2009-10-28,Mr. PAULSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  before the House today to remember an  American hero, Major Tad Hervas of  Coon Rapids, who died in Iraq on October 6.  It’s so easy for us in the hustle and  bustle of life to focus on our own challenges and our own concerns, and it’s  only natural for us to seek as much  comfort and security as we can get in  our own lives. But then something happens that comes to remind us that  whatever  success,  security or hopes  that we have depends on the sacrifice  and the service of those who offer their  lives in defense of our Nation.  Everything that we have as Americans was built on such a foundation  over many generations. Every privilege  that we will enjoy in the future will be  bought with the heroic way our military performs its essential duty.  In the community of Coon Rapids,  Minnesota, we continue to mourn the  death of Major Hervas, who truly embodied the sacrifice that makes America what it is today.  Tad  graduated  from Coon Rapids  High School in 1979. He went on to attend the University of Minnesota-Duluth, where he began a successful career in the military.  Major Hervas served in the Air Force  in the very first Gulf War. After 9/11, he  enlisted  in  the Minnesota National  Guard, joining Minnesota’s great 34th  Red Bull  Infantry Division. He was  serving his second tour in Iraq when he  lost his life in Basra just a few weeks  ago.  Mr. Speaker, I have never worn our  country’s uniform myself, but one of  the greatest honors of this job is all  the opportunities I have to spend with  those who do so. Hollywood movies  tend to glamorize military folks and  portray them as super men or super  women, but what I have found to be so  truly amazing is that they are just regular people who achieve super things.  What makes them special is their drive  to answer to a higher calling and truly  put service to country above everything else.  As the Scriptures affirm, there is no  greater love that a person can show  than to lay down their lives for their  friends. Major Hervas, over a period of  decades, laid aside his own comfort, security and personal plans for his family,  friends and neighbors,  including  millions of people who never,  ever  knew him. We owe him a debt of gratitude that we can truly never repay.  We stand with his father, Ned, and  his mother, Barb, and his whole family  in grief, and we assure them that we  will do everything we can to try to  help ease their pain in his passing.  Basra, Iraq is a long way from Coon  Rapids, Minnesota, in every conceivable way. I know that the inspiration  for Major Hervas’ service was a love for  his country and a desire to see freedom  grow around the world so that others  can enjoy the same freedoms that we  all do. By creating a safer place for  freedom to grow, Major Hervas gave a  gift to future generations of Iraqis who  may be able to live better than their  predecessors were able to do.  Mr. Speaker, as we get back to debating health care and other important  issues here like the economy, I want to  make sure, and I hope that we will all  take a moment to remember Major Tad  Hervas and his sacrifice for all of us.  He and thousands like him make our  freedom possible and our future bright.  Let us do everything in our power to  make this a Nation that is worthy of  the ultimate sacrifice that he made.  f  ",2009

1898,148,2009-10-28,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I am glad to  join my colleagues on the floor this afternoon to  talk about the final stages of our push  to complete what has been a very long  journey to bring health care to the millions of Americans that don’t have it,  to lower the cost of care for the millions of small businesses and families  that can’t afford it, and to start finally  doing something about the great burden to taxpayers in this entire economy of the cost of a system that outpaces all of our competitive neighbors  across the globe by a two-fold margin.  We will hopefully be joined here on the  floor by some other Members who are  just as interested in reform this afternoon.  Let me start out by saying that this  really  should be a bipartisan  issue.  Health care reform, which touches individuals no matter whether they are a  Republican or a Democrat, whether  they are a liberal or a conservative,  should be a bipartisan issue. We should  be sitting here working together to try  to pass reform. Because when it comes  down to it, there is, I think, broad bipartisan agreement, both in this House  and out in the public, about what the  problems are out there.  We have too many people that are  playing by the rules, doing everything  we ask, getting  the  job, being employed, putting food on their table for  their family and their kids but they  can’t get health care insurance. Five  out of six of the uninsured in this country are part of a family that have at  least one full-time worker.  We agree that it doesn’t make sense  that there are so many people who are  doing everything we ask and simply  can’t afford to have health care insurance. We also agree that  it doesn’t  make too much sense that doctors have  seen a lot of the joy be taken out of the  practice of medicine as  they  spend  more and more of their time filling out  paperwork, hiring claims managers and  fighting with insurance companies.  b1500  We need to get physicians back to  the practice of medicine and get the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:09 Jan 16, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00148 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H28OC9.REC H28OC9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

If it was easy,  it would have been done under the first  President  Bush,  President  Reagan,  President Carter. If this was easy, it  would have been done already. It’s not  easy. This  is one of the most complicated, convoluted health care systems in the world, which is part of the  source of the problem that we find ourselves in today. And so the solution is  not one sound bite, the solution isn’t 10  pages; the solution is tough to come to.  I have faith that the American people  are going to get what they’ve been asking  for—as  we’ve mentioned  here  today—for over 100 years, a system of  health care which guarantees that they  get coverage not  just when  they’re  very sick, but throughout their lives,  and gives it to them at a price they can  afford.

1900,155,2009-10-28,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2009, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. AKIN) is recognized for 60  minutes as the designee of the minority leader.  ",2009
1901,155,2009-10-28,Mr. AKIN.," Welcome to this debate  that’s been going on now for a good  number of months, a debate that has  caught the attention of Americans everywhere, Members of Congress, Members of the Senate, the question about  health care. It’s something that’s big,  it’s as big as 18 percent of the entire  U.S. economy.  We have seen in the last number of  weeks the involvement of the government in new and expanded ways in this  economy, not just the 18 percent, but  we have seen czars setting the salaries  of people in the insurance and banking  industry, firing the president of General Motors. So we’ve seen quite a  trend of the government getting  involved in the private sector. But this  involvement in the area of health care  is certainly the biggest of all; this is 18  percent of the entire American economy.  I had the pleasure of being able to sit  here and listen to quite a number of  the Democrats talking about health  care. It was like coming from a different planet. I thought it was interesting  that  they  talked  about  pet  phrases and slogans and things. I guess  there have been quite a lot of different  words bantering about and different  phrases and things, and I think it’s important for us to be very precise with  our use of words. Otherwise we fall into  very serious mistakes.  One of  the  things  that has been  talked about is will there be a public  option? That’s kind of an interesting  choice of words, a public option. What  that really means, in political talk, is  not a public option, but a government  solution. A government solution.  So when you talk about a public option, really the public doesn’t have  anything to say about who’s going to  get treated or what price it’s going to  cost or how it’s going to work. The  public has no say in that; the government is the one who does that.  And in terms of options, you can talk  about how bad health insurance companies are—and certainly they do some  things that we don’t like—but there is  one thing about health insurance companies: If you don’t like one, you at  least have some option to try and find  something else. If the option  is the  U.S. Government, your only option is  to go to another country.  b1600  So there’s not much option and not  much that is public about the public  option. Another phrase  that  sounds  just wonderful is ‘‘every American has  a right to health care.’’ Hmm, that’s an  interesting phrase. Let’s think about  that a little bit.  There was  once  a  country  that  doesn’t exist right now that had the  idea that everybody had a right to certain basic things. For instance, if it  gets really cold outside, you should  have a right to housing, because if you  don’t have a warm place to live, you’ll  freeze to death. So they said that everybody should have a right to housing.  If you don’t have  food to eat,  you’ll starve to death. So everybody  should have a right to food. They said  that everybody should have a right to  education, that you should be able to  read. So in each of these cases, the government was going to provide housing  and food and education. The government said that you also needed to have  a right to have a job. So the government was going to provide the job. And  the government, of course, said that  you had to have a right to health care,  so the government was going to provide your health care.  This idea that because it’s essential  for your survival to have housing or  food or education or a job or health  care, to say, then, or to assume that,  therefore, it’s a right is to make the  same assumption that was made by the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  We used to call them commies when I  was younger. How well did their system work? It didn’t work very well.  Lots of people got lousy health care,  starved to death, froze to death and  were persecuted and killed by their  government because they had an assumption that you had a right to all  these different things.  But I think that when our Founders  started America, they talked about a  right to something else, a right to life,  a right to liberty, a right to pursue  happiness. What’s  the difference between those things? Well, the right to  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is something that is granted by  God to each and every individual citizen. Nobody else gives you that. Only  God himself.  When you talk about a right to food,  does that mean that the farmer has to  be your slave and give you food, which  is the product of the sweat of his brow?  I don’t think so. We call that stealing.  So we need to be a little careful when  we talk about rights a little bit too  quickly. Because when you assume you  have a  right,  then  it’s  the government’s job to enforce it, and pretty  soon you end up with public option or  essentially one choice, and that is the  government running everything.  So let’s take a look at when the government does too much. What happens  when the government does too much?  Well, one of the things we can see by  other departments of the Federal Government is that we have some sense of  rationing,  inefficient  allocation  of  services, degraded quality, and excessive expense. These are things that are  not uncommon in government departments.  You can think about the postal department. The postal department  is  not known for its efficiency. There are  a  lot of private operations that are  more efficient than the postal department. It was necessary when America  first got going. But the government  can do too much. That is the point of  many of us on this side.  It’s not that we want to have people  not have health care, but it’s also a reality on our side, as a Republican, that  there are things called the law of supply and demand. And as much as we  might like to repeal those basic laws,  like the law of gravity, the laws of  physics, the laws of economics and supply and demand, we can’t do that. We  cannot have the government guarantee  everybody to get absolute  first-class  health care at absolutely no cost. It  just doesn’t work mathematically. You  can’t do it.  So the promise is that you’re going  to get Cadillac-quality health care at  no cost, and don’t worry because the  government’s going to take care of it.  That’s a great proposition. And if you  believe  that,  there’s probably  some  swampland  in New Jersey that you  could buy.  What happens when the government  does too much? Well, we’ve taken a  look at the Democratic health plan and  tried to put 1,000 pages—because it’s  got to be complicated to take over 18  percent of the economy. So we came up  with this chart. Every colored box here  is a new agency or something created.  Now, if you think of yourself as a consumer and you’ve got the doctors on  the other side, you’ve got to somehow  get  through  this maze  to get your  health care.  Obviously, the first thing that you  note about this chart is—and as you  can imagine, a 1,000-page bill, if it’s as  limited as that—I’m sure it’s longer  than 1,000 pages—is not going to be  simple.

This is especially so when one person of a party  that probably has been for a lifetime  has an opportunity to serve this great  Nation under the leadership of a President from another party. I think that  that really tests, whether you are Republican or Democrat or Independent,  your willingness to understand that  there are so many different ways to  serve this great Nation.

1906,176,2009-10-28,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I hope we  can work something out with the Republicans. We are going to have that  vote as soon as we can. I am sorry that  we might have to do it in the morning.  I think we should be able to avoid that.  The vote was held later than I wanted  it because a Senator was quite ill. I  hope we can work something out. We  have bipartisan support, and that  is  just not words.  We have significant numbers of Republicans and Democrats who want to  do two things—one, to do something  about the first-time home buyers tax  credit. There has been general agreement by a significant number of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to  get this done. The legislation is before  this body now. We also have the loss  carryback, which is extremely important for businesses at this time, also  widely agreed upon. It was originally  sponsored by Senator BUNNING, and  now Senator BAUCUSand others have  agreed to this—not two or three Senators but significant numbers on both  sides. We could get those done. We have  given the Republicans a request to do  it in 2 hours, and Senators said they  don’t even need that much time to get  this done.  ",2009

1909,176,2009-10-28,Mr. MCCONNELL.," I would just say to  my  friend, we have a  lot of  fights  around here over things we disagree on,  but on this particular measure, this is  an unnecessary impasse that we have.  We have come very close to a very  modest number of amendments. My  side would be more than happy to accept time agreements on all of the  amendments. I want to second what  the majority leader says, that I hope  we can indeed work out an agreement  for a modest number of amendments  with time agreements and wrap up this  bill because I certainly share his view  that most Members support the underlying measure and  the additions  to  which the majority leader has referred.

1910,176,2009-10-28,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, first of all,  the other amendments are vexatious.  They are argumentative. They are not  germane. They are not relevant to this  legislation. But it seems that this year,  every time we get where we try to get  something done, we have had stalling.  We had a Senator out here yesterday  who had done the work to find out how  many times we have been stopped from  doing things. Almost 60 times on absolute filibusters we have had to invoke  cloture and 30-some-odd times on just  objecting to legislation going forward.  The other amendments the Republican leader has suggested are amendments that are not related to this legislation, and there  is wide disagreement from Republicans and Democrats.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

As I close, I  again thank my colleagues, the freshmen, for once again coming this week  and making our point clear on innovation and the impact it will have on  bringing accountability and a better  product  for  the  consumer,  ensuring  that we reduce costs through innovation.  I heard this morning some one-liners  from the other side that say ‘‘rationing, delay, deny’’ is what we are all  about over here. Absolutely wrong.  What we are about is ensuring that the  current rationing going on by insurance companies, the delay by insurance  companies, and the denials by insurance companies stop so our consumers  long-term health  have good-quality,  care.  As I said earlier when the Senator  from Oregon was talking, I heard again  this morning that the American people  were being taken for a ride. My comment was that I agree with the other  side; they are—right over the cliff. It is  time to take action and have health  care reform.  Is it a perfect bill when we are all  here on the floor at some point discussing it? It may not be. But is it better than where we are today? Absolutely, because today is literally taking the American people right over the  cliff. So it is in the best interests of the  American people to move forward and  create a better system that is more accountable with better quality.  I appreciate my freshman colleagues  for standing up today and laying out  new,  innovative approaches that are  working across this country.  I yield my time.  ",2009

1916,183,2009-10-28,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, one of  the first rules in health care that doctors  learn and health care providers  learn is to do no harm. So, as we move  down the road of this health reform effort, I think we ought to have that as  our watchword also. The health reform  effort which we pursue should do no  harm to a lot of the elements of our  health care system which are doing  pretty well.  For example, there are a large number of Americans who get health insurance from the private sector—about 170  or 180 million—who are quite happy  with their health care. They may have  concerns with their insurance companies, legitimately, but they think their  health care  is pretty good.  In  fact,  American health care is excellent.  As we move down this road toward  health  reform, we  should not harm  those folks. We should not push them  into a public plan by creating a system  which basically disincentivizes  their  employers to give them health care,  incentivizes employers to pay a penalty rather than pay a health care premium, and moves people over to what  are called health exchanges in a public  plan. But that is exactly what the bill  did as it left the HELP Committee, and  who knows what it is going to do when  it comes out of the secret room where  it is being written right now, but I  wouldn’t be surprised if that is exactly  what it does when it returns from this  secret room. That will be harmful—  harmful to all Americans who have  health insurance and like what they  have. They like the doctors they see,  and they don’t want to have the Federal Government basically supplying  their health care and putting them  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:39 Oct 28, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28OC6.010 S28OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1920,190,2009-10-28,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  have come to talk specifically about  the urgency of passing the unemployment benefit extension.  I want to take a moment to respond  to my friend from Oklahoma, who was  essentially bashing the Government’s  ability to provide any kind of structure  or opportunity for health care, saying  that the Federal Government cannot  be trusted to provide access to health  care for people. I suggest that the 40  million people who receive their health  care  through Medicare—seniors over  age 65 and people with disabilities—  would probably disagree with that. I  think my  83-year-old mother would  wrestle me to the ground if I tried to  take away her Medicare card. She has  access to choose her own doctor and  procedures.  This is a system that involves the  public and private sectors, and it was  in fact established in 1965 by the U.S.  Government to make sure seniors and  people with disability have health care.  Also, those who are poor in this country and have lost their jobs and are  fearful of losing their health care, families, and low-income seniors who need  to go into nursing homes would probably disagree with my  friends  from  Oklahoma about Medicaid, even though  there are many challenges  that we  need to work on in terms of rates and  so on.  Medicaid is a safety net for many  Americans. That is the difference, in  some  cases,  for  seniors  in nursing  homes between life and death.  I am proud the Federal Government  also stepped up on Medicaid. I also  think the Children’s Health Insurance  Program, which was  started  in  the  nineties for low-income working families to make sure that if someone is  working in a job and does not have  health insurance, at least their children can be taken care of with a low-  cost policy they pay for. But we established and created a way for families to  get health  insurance.  I  think  those  folks would probably disagree with the  statement as well.  In many regards, the VA—and while  there  are  certainly  challenges  and  issues and we all push through to make  sure our constituents are served—has  been in the forefront of health information  technology,  electronic medical  records, and so on. The VA is a system  that works  for  our  veterans  as  it  should. When it is not well funded, as it  has not been in the past with the previous administration, we stepped up to  increase  the  funding  repeatedly  to  make sure our veterans have what they  need through a Federal Government  health care system.  Finally, I will just say, there are our  military and military retirees as well  whom, I am proud to say, our country  has  supported  through  providing  a  health care system.  We can talk more about health care  at another time. But I do think this  ongoing effort to be critical of anything we do collectively as a country,  through a democratic process of government, that somehow that is bad, I  find that interesting, when we are saying to those around the world they  should go to our system. We, together  through our system, have made sure  there  are  opportunities  for many  Americans, most Americans,  if you  count the employer-based health care  system, the tax credits, the incentives  for employers, the government policy.  In some way, our government has been  involved in incentivizing health care.  The question now is, Do we complete  the job? I am very hopeful we will complete the job for every American and  tackle health care costs that are crippling our businesses, our government,  and our families.  I wish to speak about something else  that is of tremendous urgency for families. I was very pleased that last night,  finally, after 3 weeks of blocking our  ability to get to this bill to extend unemployment benefits, we have the opportunity to get to a vote. Eighty-  seven Members voted to proceed to the  bill. I don’t understand, when 87 Members vote to proceed to the bill, why we  could not have done this sooner.  Since we started to try to get to this  bill, to this point today, 143,000-plus  people have lost their unemployment  insurance benefits—just in the last 3  weeks, over 143,000 people, who have  done nothing but work all their lives,  play by the rules, the job goes away,  they are trying to find another job and,  in the meantime, keep a roof over the  head for their family, food on the table,  turn on that electric, turn on that  heating system, which is going to cost  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:39 Oct 28, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28OC6.018 S28OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

Right now, many middle-class families are facing the prospect of losing  the unemployment benefits they are  relying on to get them through this recession.

1924,211,2009-10-28,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Madam President, I  wish to speak about jobs and unemployment. I know we are in this period  postcloture on the effort to extend unemployment benefits. Frankly, I have  great difficulty understanding why we  should have to be going through this  kind of procedural obstacle in order to  extend unemployment benefits to the  many Americans who need those benefits. So I hope we can get through that.  I hope we can go ahead and pass the extension  of  unemployment  benefits.  Frankly, that does not begin to address  the overall employment and job needs  of the country. I think we all recognize  that. I wish to talk a little bit about  that today.  Frankly, we need additional policies  to create jobs. Even as Congress and  the President focus on other critical  challenges facing the country, including health care reform and climate  change and energy, at the same time  those  issues are being discussed, we  need to also prioritize job creation.  While there has been considerable debate about whether the Recovery Act  is working, whether it has raised the  gross domestic product, whether it is  creating jobs, most economists tell us  the Recovery Act has boosted the gross  domestic product by 2 to 4 percentage  points during the past 6 months. With  two-thirds of the funds not yet spent,  the Recovery Act certainly has the potential to create or save 4 million jobs,  as the administration has expected it  would and as all of us hope it does.  I have divided my remarks into three  parts. First,  I wish to describe the  scale of the job-creation problem the  country faces. Because of the anemic  job creation we have seen in this country over the last 9 years, the economy  is short by about 12 million jobs from  what we actually need in order to have  reasonable employment. Second, there  is considerable evidence—and this  is  the second subject I will address—there  is considerable evidence that this recession is much worse than it was expected to be. Critics of the Recovery  Act  are missing  this  fundamental  point. The Recovery Act is working,  but the recession is more severe than  the Recovery Act was designed to address. Accordingly, we need to do more.  Finally, I will propose four ideas to  create  jobs  I think Congress should  hold hearings on and  fully debate.  These are, by no means, the only good  ideas, but given the size of the problem  we face, Congress should consider all  ideas that have a potential to create  jobs.  I have two charts that illustrate the  scale of the job-creation problem. Let  me start by putting up this first chart.  The black line on this chart shows the  monthly change in the number of jobs  since January of 2001. The red number,  which is right here, this red area represents 100,000 jobs. That is an important number to understand. It is the  break-even number. Because our population is constantly growing, we need  to create about 100,000 new jobs every  month just to maintain our unemployment and our employment level. That  is 100,000 jobs per month just to keep  unemployment from going up. Every  time the black  line—this black  line  you see here—every time that black  line is in the red area, which is most of  the time in the last 9 years, we are not  creating enough jobs to break even and  the jobs deficit is getting larger and  more Americans are out of work.  As my colleagues can see, for most of  the past 9 years, the number of new  jobs has been  far short of where  it  needs to be. From 2001 to 2004, the jobs  deficit grew by 5.8 million jobs. Even  when job creation was above the break-  even  level—and  that  is  this period  where this black line is above the reddish area on the chart—even in that period, it was never high enough to dig us  out of the hole we had created in the  previous years.  The second chart I wish to show is labeled ‘‘The Jobs Deficit.’’ It shows the  total jobs deficit that has accumulated  over the past 9 years. It illustrates the  cumulative effect of 9 years of slow job  creation and job losses. The country  had 132.5 million jobs in December of  2000. If job creation had kept pace with  population growth,  today we would  have 143 million jobs, but it has not.  Today, we are 12 million jobs short of  that number. The chart shows how that  has happened. Today we have only 131  million jobs. We actually have fewer  jobs today than we had before President Bush took office.  The takeaway from these charts is  this: The job situation for Americans is  dismal. Congress needs to act quickly  so new job-creation policies will overlap with and will complement the remaining Recovery Act funds that will  be invested this next year. There is no  danger of doing too much to create  jobs, as I see it. We should learn from  Japan’s lost decade. Japan was plagued  by weak economic growth and  lackluster  job creation all  through  the  1990s. Its lost decade, as that period is  referred to, was caused by the bursting  of an asset price bubble similar to what  triggered the financial crisis we experienced  last year. The primary  lesson  from Japan’s lost decade is, intermittent stimulus policies are ineffective.  We need to take sustained and overwhelming  action  to  reenergize  our  economy.  Let me speak for a moment about the  current recession and data about the  current recession. In January of this  year, the prospects  for the economy  were truly grim. The country had lost  jobs in every month in 2008—over 3 million jobs in total. Over 1.6 million jobs  were lost in just October, November,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:55 Oct 29, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28OC6.053 S28OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

1928,218,2009-10-28,Mr. KAUFMAN.," I rise once again to  recognize the service of one of America’s great Federal employees. Right  now the Congress, the President, and  the American public are engaged  in  historic discussions about the future of  our health insurance system. This is  one of the most important issues facing  the country.  The dedicated public servant I will  speak about today works for a government-run health insurance program already  serving  44 million Americans.  Medicare was established in 1965. Its  mission is to provide coverage for all  Americans over the age of 65. At the  time of  its creation, Medicare  faced  criticism from those who were apprehensive of a government-run health insurance  program.  Today,  however,  Medicare is praised as a great success.  Indeed,  its  fiercest defenders  sit on  both sides in this Chamber.  Medicare continues to protect nearly  one  out  of  every  seven Americans  against what would be otherwise prohibitive medical costs. The reason for  its success is not only that it provides  a much needed service to America’s  seniors; one of its greatest strengths is  that the men and women who administer Medicare benefits are among the  most outstanding Federal employees.  They work for an agency called the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services or CMS. The CMS employee I  will talk about today has worked as a  Medicare benefits administrator for 11  years. Iris Morales joined the CMS Chicago Regional Office after having first  served several years in the Navy. She  has been on the front line as a benefits  administrator helping to set at ease  those who contact the CMS with inquiries about their coverage.  Iris has called her job incredibly rewarding, and she is one of so many  Medicare  administrators who  spend  their days solving problems for America’s seniors. On one day she might  work to make sure a cancer patient has  access to lifesaving chemotherapy. On  the next  Iris might  reassure beneficiaries that their copayments are low  enough  for  them  to  afford  critical  treatments.  Iris is set to retire next year, and  when she does, she will join the ranks  of Medicare  beneficiaries  herself.  I  know that Iris, as a beneficiary, will  receive from those helping her in the  years to come the same kind of attention to detail, diligence, and professionalism  she  has  demonstrated  through her years at CMS.  Iris Morales and all of the hard-working employees of CMS are proof of the  constructive and  important role our  government already plays in ensuring  Americans’ access to affordable health  care. I hope my colleagues will join me  in recognizing this unsung hero and all  of the employees at CMS. I honor their  contributions, and I thank them  for  the great job they do every day. I know  that America’s seniors are grateful for  their patience, their caring, and their  service to the Nation.  I yield the floor.  ",2009

1932,218,2009-10-28,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, it has  been a little over a year since a group  of us met  in the Foreign Relations  Committee room headed by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr.  DODD, to talk about the financial crisis  we were facing and how we would deal  with that. We came out of that meeting, held a press conference where we  sounded perhaps more optimistic than  we should have at the time about having a solution to that problem. And out  of that has come now a name that is  well known  throughout  the country  called TARP. We did not call it that at  the time.  But we talked it through in a completely bipartisan and substantive way  and voted for the rescue package that  came out of that discussion. I voted for  that package. I voted for the original  disbursement of TARP. I stand by that  vote a year later. It was the right vote,  the right situation, the right time, and  the right thing to do.  But I will share now some of the  thoughts that went into my participation  in that particular meeting and  some of the things that came out of it.  In anticipation of the meeting, I called  some people whose judgment I trust  and discussed this. I was told Treasury  cannot physically push $700 billion out  the door. You cannot sign that many  contracts. That is far too much money.  The  suggestion  I made was: Why  don’t we give them $50 billion, because  I was told that is the most they could  spend in any one month. Why don’t we  give them $50 billion for 5 months or  $250 billion and see how it works before  we buy into the $700 billion number  that Secretary Paulson was  talking  about.  No, Secretary Paulson let us know he  had to have $700 billion as the headline.  He could not calm down the markets,  the international markets, unless he  had a number that big. We talked it  over in that room and came up with  this solution, which I think was a good  one. We would give them a $700 billion  headline, because we authorized $700  billion, but we actually only gave him  $350 billion and said he would have to  come back to the Congress for the second 350.  Also in that group—and it was not by  any means my suggestion or anyone  else’s  suggestion—it was overwhelmingly the consensus: We have to put  some controls in here. We have a congressional oversight committee  that  we created. We have to create an inspector general. I remember one of the  members of the group saying: I do not  trust any Treasury Secretary, no matter how bright he is, with $700 billion  and absolutely no reporting or transparency or control situation.

1933,225,2009-10-28,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Yes, exactly correct. Unless they are involved in boycott or coercion, they can fix prices,  carve up territories, do  innumerable  anticompetitive things that any other  industry in America would have to answer for in a court of law. They get a  pass on it because of the McCarran-  Ferguson Act. But it shows, as the Senator from Illinois is pointing out, how  vitally  important competition  is because that public option, I doubt it is  going to sit down with private insurance industry and fix prices or carve up  territories. It will have a public purpose and a public function, and it will  be serving the people rather than the  shareholders of the insurance company.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam  President,  I  say  to  Senator  WHITEHOUSE, let me join in here with  him and Senator DURBIN because the  thing he pointed out—and that is the  crux of this argument, right here on  this chart—that when we talk about a  public option—and the Senator has hit  it over and over again and Senator  DURBINmentioned  it—it  is competitiveness. That is what we want to see,  competitiveness. We are not talking  about a government takeover. We are  not talking about single payer. We are  not talking about all these things our  friends on the other side of the aisle  say about this reform. We are talking  about making the system more competitive.  People may not realize that in many  of our States, when you talk about insurance company monopolies, there are  States where more than 75 percent are  covered by just two insurers. So we  have the State of Montana with two insurers, more than 75 percent of the  market. Look at Minnesota, Iowa, all  these  darker  States, Maine. These  States have very  little  competition  going on.  What the Senator talked about is,  No. 1, the Federal Government cannot  move in. I don’t know if Senator DURBINheard this. But at the beginning,  there was a big national news article  that said the insurance companies are  getting ready to raise the rates because  they know reform is coming, and there  is not a single thing the Federal Government can do about it. We have a  great antitrust unit over in the Justice  Department, but they cannot do anything about it because we have these  laws in place.  This  is, once again, what we are  going to see. This is the pattern in the  past:  Skyrocketing  insurance  premiums,  sky-high  insurance company  profits. In the last 7 years, a 428-percent increase, and all that is going on  while these 47 million Americans are  without insurance, premiums doubled  in 9 years, and these huge CEO salaries.  I think the public option is the key  to bringing  competitiveness  to  this  market. I am glad the Senator from  Rhode Island and the Senator from Illinois are working in committee to see  that our antitrust units may be able to  get involved in these kinds of situations in the future.  (Mr. BENNET assumed the chair.)  ",2009
1934,225,2009-10-28,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.,"  If  the  distinguished Senator will yield, the way  this works out in individual people’s  lives—it is important for us as policymakers to understand what the Senator  from New Mexico pointed out;  that is, a 428-percent increase in insurance company profits in just 7 years,  while they are turning people down and  pushing them off coverage, even 47 million  Americans  uninsured,  denying  their  claims, while  the  profits  are  going up like that. That is a very important story.  But then you get down to the actual  people who get tangled up in this and  what it does to their lives. Nicole from  Providence, RI, wrote to me. In 2008,  her doctor prescribed a number of tests  she needed to take because she was experiencing stomach problems. Similar  to many Americans who have gotten  into these nightmares, they come in  thinking they are all set, they have  good health insurance.  Nicole thought she had good health  insurance. She  never  imagined  she  would have any problem covering her  medical costs. But the insurance company, once it started getting the bills,  went scurrying around through its files  and started to look for a way to get out  of having to pay. Sure enough, they decided  that her  condition was  ‘‘preexisting.’’ The magic word  so  they  don’t have to pay. Sure enough, they  denied thousands of dollars of Nicole’s  claims.  So now there is Nicole. She thought  she had insurance. She thought everything was fine. She had this stomach  illness. She had to take these tests.  She sends in the bills to the insurance  company and they say: No, sorry, that  is preexisting. So she is scrambling to  pay off thousands and thousands  in  debt. That starts you off into the whole  set of other problems, those administrative  costs  I was  talking  about.  Those administrative costs are spent  fighting patients,  fighting  their clients.  Here  is Nicole  constantly on  the  phone trying to get the correct documentation from her doctor to the insurance company, trying to get it to  match up, and it never does and the  bills keep coming. It is not only that  she did not get the health care she  needed and the company would not pay  for it, it is when she tries to sort it out,  she gets into this bureaucratic nightmare with that bureaucracy that grew  109 percent just in this decade arming  up to fight people such as Nicole.  Here is what she concluded. This is a  regular person  from Providence, RI,  snarled in the health insurance system.  She says:  I have a full-time job with a good salary. I  own a home. I have health insurance. I am a  middle-class American doing everything  I  think I should. And yet I am now saddled  with thousands of dollars in medical bills  that I cannot afford to pay.  The stories go on and on of people in  this system. Coreen from Cranston, RI,  wrote me. She has health  insurance  through her employer, but the insurance company jacked up its premiums  so high this year that her husband’s  employer was  forced to switch to a  high-deductible plan. She has a deductible of $2,000. So now Coreen and her  husband take turns who is going to see  the doctor, depending on which one of  them they think is the most ill. The  healthier one doesn’t go and lets the  one they think is sicker go. Do they  know? Of course not, they are not experts, they are not doctors, but they  have to make this decision because  they have had this limitation put on  their policy.  She wrote to me:  We have no other option but to be held  hostage by our insurer. In our current system, people come second and profits come  first.  For all the big picture stuff we are  talking about, it is important to remember  that all  these big pictures  come down to homes and families and  people  and workers  all  across  this  country, all of whom  find that this  health care system is a nightmare for  them under the private health insurance regime.  ",2009
1935,225,2009-10-28,Mr. DURBIN.,"  If  the Senator will  yield, I would like to note that I received a similar letter from a man in  Illinois who had a $5,000 deductible because he had a history of illness. So in  order to buy health insurance he could  afford, he had to be willing to first put  out $5,000 in cash out before they would  cover the first dollar. He was told by  his doctor, because of an examination,  that he would need a  colonoscopy,  which is rather common and certainly  a thoughtful thing to do when there is  an indication. But he found it would  cost him  $3,000 out-of-pocket  for a  colonoscopy, and he would have to pay  that because the insurance plan didn’t  cover it. He didn’t have the $3,000.  ",2009
1936,225,2009-10-28,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," May  I  inquire  back if the insurance company, to the  Senator’s knowledge, actually checked  to  see  if  by  taking  the  $3,000  colonoscopy they might find out something about his health so that in the  long run everybody would save money  because they did the test at the right  time?  ",2009
1937,225,2009-10-28,Mr. DURBIN.," Well, I don’t know the  answer to that, but I would suspect  that they did not because the concern  for that insurance company is the bottom line for that quarter. They are not  concerned, as they should be, about the  long-term health of this man. If there  is  an  indication  that  leads  to  a  colonoscopy, it makes common sense  that you would do it because things  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:43 Oct 29, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28OC6.070 S28OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009
1938,232,2009-10-28,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, our Nation has  long recognized that small  businesses are the true innovators in  our economy. Indeed, according to the  U.S. Small Business Administration,  our Nation’s 27 million  small  firms  generate a majority of the innovation  coming from American businesses and  produce 13 times more patents per employee than their larger counterparts.  But to continue this trend, we need a  new,  younger  generation  of  entrepreneurs to rise to the forefront and  open their own small businesses. That  is why I am proud to rise today to recognize the entrepreneurial spirit and  ingenuity of a young woman from my  home State of Maine whose graphic  and Web design company is providing  clients with, in her words, ‘‘ fresh ideas  that grow results.’’  iBec Creative was founded in 2006 by  entrepreneur Becky Stockbridge. As a  senior at the University of Southern  Maine, Ms. Stockbridge wrote a business plan to start a Web and graphic  design  business  for medical  professionals. She realized that this critical  segment of our economy was in desperate need of innovative and creative  ways to promote their expertise, including through brochures, logos, and  informational Web sites. With a $4,200  grant from the Libra Future Fund, a  Maine-based  nonprofit  organization  that supports young entrepreneurs, as  well as free office space awarded by the  Maine Center for Enterprise Development, she embarked upon her fledgling  entrepreneurial career. To overcome a  slow start, Ms. Stockbridge soon began  designing Web sites and graphic designs  for  small businesses  in other  fields and by seizing upon these additional opportunities, she greatly broadened her client base.  In her continued efforts to present  clients with cutting-edge technology,  Ms. Stockbridge’s  innovative assortment of development, design, and monitoring services have turned iBec Creative into a well-respected five-person  small  company  with  an  expected  $350,000 in revenue for 2009. iBec currently specializes in providing a wide  range  of marketing  and  consulting  services to its clients, such as Web design and search engine optimization,  SEO,  consulting,  branding,  internet  marketing, traditional marketing, and  project  management.  Additionally,  iBec Creative utilizes emerging media  to promote its clients various brands.  Ms. Stockbridge’s creativity, vigor,  and entrepreneurial commitment were  recently recognized by BusinessWeek  as she was named a 2009 finalist in the  America’s Best Young Entrepreneurs  competition. She  is the only person  nominated  from my home State of  Maine and the first finalist from Maine  since the contest began 5 years ago.  Ms. Stockbridge is competing against  24  other  young  entrepreneurs  from  around the Nation in this unique online challenge, and I look forward to  hearing about her successful outcome  at the end of the competition.  iBec Creative is a remarkable small  business whose story demonstrates how  community  involvement and encouragement can help entrepreneurs of all  ages  realize  their  aspirations  and  dreams. I commend Becky Stockbridge  for her innovation and determination  and wish Ms. Stockbridge and everyone  at iBec Creative the best of luck with  their burgeoning business.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

1964,253,2009-10-28,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam Speaker,  our brave student servicemembers defending  the United States  in  Iraq, Afghanistan and  other countries abroad are often charged interest on their federal college student loans while  deployed. Because this interest is costly and  unfair, I rise today to introduce the Servicemember Student Loan  Interest Relief Act  to  end the practice.  This legislation builds upon a provision included  in  the Higher Education Opportunity  Act (H.R. 4137) in the 110th Congress, which  prevents interest from accruing on loans originated after October 2008 during activations.  The  provision  provided  important  relief  to  servicemembers who  intended  to  take out  loans in the future, but it did not address those  who currently had student loan debt.  The bill I introduce today corrects that issue  and provides interest relief to all active duty  servicemembers with eligible loans. Our students in uniform could save up to $1,479 during a 12- to 15-month activation under this bill,  according to estimates.  As our servicemembers put  themselves  in  harm’s way, the least we can do is put their  student loans on hold until they return home.  I’m pleased to work with Senator BAYHon this  important issue.  I urge passage of this legislation and yield  back the balance of my time.  f  HONORING THE WORLD WAR II  VETERANS OF ILLINOIS  HON.

1968,253,2009-10-28,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker, Today  I come  to  remember W.C.  ‘‘Dub’’ Jones of  Port Arthur, Texas. Jones passed away on  September 14, 2009 at the age of 69 after his  fight against cancer. He was born in Bradley,  Arkansas on June 20, 1940 to the late Tillman  and Hattie Jones.  Jones moved to Port Arthur at a young age  and later attended the local school. He began  working in the late 1950’s on inshore waterways of the Gulf Coast and then as a seaman  serving abroad U.S.  flagged cargo vessels.  After spending several years out at sea, he  went to work as a longshoreman in Port Arthur. Due to his continuous hard work, he rose  to positions of greater influence and eventually  became the Commissioner of the Port of Port  Arthur in 2002.

1969,3,2009-11-05,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Unlike any other industry or business  in America,  the  health  insurance  industry  is exempt  from antitrust laws. That means they  can and they do collude to drive up  your premiums, to exclude you from  coverage,  to  rescind your policy, a  whole host of abuses. We do have a little bit of State regulation, but the Republicans are going to take care of  that. They’re going to create a new  for  company  insurance  safe  haven  abuses.  Insurance companies will be able to  offer national plans—that’s their big  thing, yes—but they can choose any  State in the 50 in which to base that  plan. And no matter where you live and  no matter what the laws are of your  State,  if  you’ve  got  a  problem—if  they’ve denied you coverage, if they revoked your policy because you got  sick, all the other abuses that go on  every day within the insurance industry—if you live in Oregon, you’ll have  to be talking to the insurance commissioner in Delaware or Mississippi with  your complaint. And guess what? They  don’t have consumer protections there  for health insurance. The States will  provide and compete, some States, the  lowest common denominator, the least  regulation to attract this great new  business of abusive health insurers.  That’s the Republican plan. They’re  always delivering for their buddies in  the health  insurance  industry while  the payments roll in at campaign time.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2009
1970,3,2009-11-05,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Members are limited to 1 minute and should  heed the gavel.  f  PELOSI HEALTH CARE  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ,2009
1971,3,2009-11-05,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, when I talk  with constituents in my district, it’s  clear that more and more of the American people do not support the Pelosi  plan  for a government  takeover of  health care. Sadly, that will not stop  liberal Democrats  from pushing  forward with the Pelosi plan anyway.  Buried in the 1,990-page bill are more  than $700 billion in new taxes on small  businesses and individuals and employers who can’t afford health care. The  Pelosi health care plan also includes  more  than  100  new  bureaucracies,  boards,  commissions,  and  programs.  What it does not include is coverage for  29 million of the 30 million people that  Pelosi and President Obama say need  health insurance. They will still not be  covered by this huge tax increase and  increased bureaucracy.  We need to reject the Pelosi health  plan—it is a tax increase masquerading  as a health plan—and take up the Republican alternative, which covers everyone.  f  HEALTH CARE BILL  (Mr. WELCH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
1972,3,2009-11-05,Mr. WELCH.," Mr. Speaker, America  knows that we live with a health care  contradiction: some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world providing health care to those who have  access to the best health care in the  world, but a health care system that  also shuts the door of access to 47 million Americans with exploding costs,  putting a punishing financial burden  on our middle class and on our businesses that are hanging on to their  health care by their fingernails.  This system has worked very well for  the insurance companies—unregulated,  unsupervised,  and  unapologetic—but  they have plundered the wallets of families and the profits of businesses to  record record profits. That, Mr. Speaker, is the status quo.  On Saturday,  this House of Representatives will face a question that  has eluded it for 60 years: Will we accept the status quo or turn the page  and provide health care to all Americans?  Our health care legislation is going  to do what needs to be done to take  that first step, extend access to 36 million Americans, insurance reforms, and  a public option.  f  WHAT’S IN THE HEALTH CARE  PACKAGE?

1974,3,2009-11-05,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker,  if you want to  know what’s in a package, you ought  to open it up and take a look at it.  Let me  just talk about one thing  that’s in this package we’re going to  vote on on Saturday. It’s in the area of  tort reform, litigation reform, a subject that every single audience  I’ve  spoken  to  in my district has  said  should be in any bill, because right now  the litigation system puts tremendous  strain on our health care system, adding additional trillions of dollars.  What does this program do? It says  that  it’s going to provide an opportunity for pilot projects. But if your  State has on its books a law which says  there will be any limitation on attorneys’ fees or any limitation on damages, including noneconomic damages,  you are ineligible to participate. So my  State of California, which had medical  malpractice reform 30 years ago, will  be ineligible, will be punished.  We’re not talking about the status  quo on litigation reform; we’re talking  about going back 30 years. If that’s in  this package, what else is in this package?  f  HEALTH REFORM FOR SMALL  BUSINESSES  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)

1976,10,2009-11-05,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I appreciate my good friend’s  passion. I don’t know whether he has  any Native American tribes in his constituency, but I do. I have Seminoles  and Miccosukees in my constituency,  and they are as proud of their ability  to operate facilities and to do those  things. As a matter of  fact, quite  frankly, both of those tribes are doing  a whole whale of a lot better than a  part of the systemic institutions that  have existed in the non-Native American area.  And I remind my friend that we are  not here about the health care bill.  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman, who is the subcommittee  Chair of the Homeland Security committee that has  jurisdiction on this  particular matter, SHEILA LEE.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker,  let me explain to the colleagues that have gathered here in this  august  institution  that  this  is  the  Homeland Security Committee, and, as  the American people have asked us to  do, we are doing our duty.  I look forward to a vigorous debate  on the health care bill, for the American people deserve that vigorous debate and transparency. But today the  Homeland Security Committee is doing  its job. The idea that we have lived in  safety and security since 9/11 to a certain degree has been because of the  diligent and vigilant work of the men  and women of the Homeland Security  JACKSON-  Department; members, of course, of the  United  States  military;  and  Congresspersons who have the absolute  duty to address the question of security of this Nation.  I would also remind my good friend  that Indian tribes in sovereign areas  have a sovereign legal distinction. We  know that their structure is somewhat  different than what we have.  I rise to support this rule because it  is a fair rule. It has allowed a number  of amendments by our friends on the  other side of the aisle, but this chemical security bill  is not a bill that  started last week. It started a number  of years ago. It has had the jurisdictional oversight of several committees,  including the Energy and Commerce  Committee.  As I have listened to a number of experts as the subcommittee Chair, we  have held hearings, we have authored  letters, we have requested briefings,  and we have visited sites. I have visited  a waste and water system site. I see  the vulnerability. I see the utilization  of chemicals that could be used or tampered with to contaminate the water of  innocent people and innocent families  and innocent children.  At the end of each step of the way, in  establishing the record for this legislation, we worked in a transparent and a  bipartisan manner to ensure that the  legislation was  thoughtful and well  balanced. We dealt with the farmers.  Chairman THOMPSONworked with the  farmers over a period of time.  You have already heard that we have  in this legislation crafted a response to  our small businesses, the backbone of  America. We have several Republican  amendments  that were  adopted  at  markup, and I know that the minority  staff was  able  to make  important  changes with our staff.  Our door remained open. Regardless  of the rhetoric that we hear today, this  has been a process that is the obligation of Homeland Security to protect  the American people. It is no doubt  that terrorism has been franchised and  there are numerous creative ways that  terrorists will be looking to contaminate.  ",2009

1978,10,2009-11-05,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," I yield the  gentlelady an additional minute.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I thank  the distinguished member of the Rules  Committee and thank him  for managing this bill.  I am grateful to the Committee on  Rules for specifically ruling 10 amendments  in order,  five of which come  from our friends on the other side. But  this again, I want to emphasize, is a responsibility that is not a nonserious responsibility, because water and wastewater sites proliferate our Nation all  over, in rural hamlets and urban centers, and it is necessary to look at that  as a potential target of any terrorist,  just as our rail system, just as our  aviation system.  What is our job than to provide the  framework than to ensure that our  water is secure. Working with the administration, this legislation gives regulatory authority over chemical facilities for DHS while giving EPA a lead  role.  I look forward to the passage of this  legislation. Why? Because the American people send us here to do our job,  and our job is to provide for the security of  the American people.  I am  grateful that over a period of time we  have protected small businesses, we are  concerned about water and wastewater  facilities, chemical facilities, and we  will be securing this Nation by pairing  this rule and this bill on chemical security.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the rule for H.R. 2868 and the underlying bill.  The underlying legislation reaffirms our solemn oath to keep the American people safe.  The legislation improves and extends a critical DHS program.  I  have  been  a  champion  of  previous  iterations of this legislation and I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 2868.  By holding hearings in my Subcommittee on  chemical security, authoring  letters, and  requesting briefings, I have been intimately involved in the implementation of this program  and assessing its needs.  At each step of the way in establishing the  record  for  this  legislation, we worked  in a  transparent, bipartisan manner to ensure that  the  legislation was  thoughtful and well balanced.  Several  Republican  amendments  were  adopted at mark-up and I know that Minority  staff was able to make important changes at  the staff level.  Regardless of  the rhetoric we hear  today,  this legislation will be considered following a  process of which we can all be proud.  I am grateful to the Committee on Rules for  ruling 10 amendments  in order, 5 of which  come from our friends on the other side of the  aisle.  Today’s discussion will further demonstrate  this  process’  commitment  to  fairness  and  transparency.  Working with the support of the Administration, this legislation gives regulatory authority  over chemical  facilities  to DHS while giving  EPA a  lead  role,  in consultation with DHS,  over water and wastewater facilities.  I look forward to the passage of H.R. 2868,  which will represent the culmination of comprehensive and collaborative efforts to protect  the American people while doing so in a manner  that understands  the sector being regulated.  I support the rule for H.R. 2868 and I look  forward to passage of the critical chemical security legislation in the underlying bill.  Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida.

1980,24,2009-11-05,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  strong support of this bipartisan legislation to  extend unemployment insurance benefits, extend and expand  the homebuyer  tax credit,  and provide needed  liquidity  to businesses  struggling to stay afloat in this difficult economy.  Millions of Americans  remain unemployed  through no fault of their own and are struggling to make ends meet. If Congress and the  President had not taken action with the Recovery Act, millions more would be unemployed. We now know that the Recovery Act  has saved or created at  least 640,000  jobs  across  the country and 6,700  jobs  in Maryland.  We are seeing signs of economic recovery  and progress. The housing and stock markets  are rebounding and the gross domestic product increased for the first time last month. To  help sustain the rebound in the housing market, I am pleased that the bill will extend the  first-time homebuyer tax credit as well as expand  the credit  to  those homeowners who  have been  in  their current  residence  for at  least the last five years. Additionally, this legislation will provide needed  liquidity  to cash-  strapped businesses by giving companies a  one-time opportunity to carry back their operating losses for five years in order to further  support our economic recovery.  Mr. Speaker, much work  remains  to be  done. Protecting the middle class, rebuilding  our economy, and providing  job growth  remains our top priority. I urge my colleagues to  support this much-needed legislation.  ",2009
1981,24,2009-11-05,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 3548, which extends  unemployment benefits  to scores of Americans who are out of work due to the severe  downturn  in  the economy. The bill will also  continue to extend the First Time Home Buyer  Tax Credit though April 30, 2010.  The $8,000 First Time Home Buyer Tax  Credit  program  has  allowed  approximately  350,000 hard working Americans  to achieve  the dream of home ownership this year. Given  that  this nation  is still struggling, providing  American families with an $8,000 homebuyer  tax credit will stabilize the housing market and  stimulate the economy. The bill will also provide a $6,500 homebuyer credit  to current  homeowners who purchase another home.  Furthermore, providing an extension of the  First Time Home Buyer Tax Credit will also  help further encourage job growth at a time  when it is desperately needed. With the purchase of a home, other  jobs are created  in  various sectors. This  includes construction,  plumbing, home appliances, and numerous  other jobs that are the result of expanding affordable housing. There is also evidence that  suggests  that neighborhoods are safer and  become more stable when  there are high  rates of home ownership in the community.  This legislation also extends unemployment  benefits to millions of Americans who otherwise would lose much needed and deserved  benefits. In this sluggish economy, American  workers are  finding  it more difficult  to  find  good jobs and this benefit will fill this gap.  This bill could not be any timelier. It extends  a provision that allows states with high unemployment, like Michigan, to provide a total of  twenty weeks of extended benefits.  Mr. Speaker, I believe today’s legislation will  further help the workers of Michigan through  these difficult times. I rise in strong support of  H.R. 3548 and urge my colleagues to support  today’s legislation.  ",2009
1982,24,2009-11-05,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, Oregon  has one of the highest unemployment rates in  the country at 11.5%, which means that hundreds of thousands of Oregonians are without  work. In the Portland region, roughly 140,000  residents are out of work.  The average weekly unemployment  insurance benefit in Oregon is $310. Each week, I  receive letters indicating how much of a lifeline  these unemployment benefits are. Unfortunately, many families are nearing the end of  these benefits.  Today, I voted to provide stability to American families hit hardest by the recession by  extending unemployment benefits. The legislation will provide families with at least 14 weeks  of additional benefits, and six more weeks to  those living in the 27 states with the highest  unemployment rates—states including Oregon.  This means over 11,000 Oregonians will retain  their insurance for an additional 20 weeks.  Also,  this bill does not add  to  the deficit.  Rather, it is paid for by extending a federal unemployment  tax  that has been  in place  for  more than 30 years.  It is important to recognize that the losses  from unemployment will last long after these  workers—and  the millions  like  them around  the country—have again found work. Income  losses for workers who are let go in a recession can persist for as long as two decades,  and in some cases longer.  The economic  crisis gripping  the United  States is one of the greatest economic challenges that the country has faced. It can be  squarely  traced  to  the  ideology of economic  deregulation, leaving the government with few  tools to address the reckless actions of many  financial institutions until it was too late.  It is time to rebuild the foundations of our  economy and improve our fiscal fitness. I look  forward to working with my colleagues to create a nation where every  family  is  safe,  healthy, and economically secure.  ",2009
1983,24,2009-11-05,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in support of H.R. 3548, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of  2009. The bill contains an important provision  extending and expanding the successful First-  Time Homebuyer Tax Credit  to homes purchased through April 30, 2010. Under current  law, the tax credit would expire on December  1, 2009, and would not apply to homes closed  on or after that date. The extension allows for  homebuyers to claim the credit if they enter  into a binding contract before May 1, 2010  and close within 60 days of that date. In addition to the extension of the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit worth up to $8,000, the legislation expands the credit to homebuyers who  have been  in  their current  residence  for at  least the past five years. The expanded credit  is worth up to $6,500.  There is strong evidence that suggests this  program has greatly aided  in stabilizing our  nation’s  housing market,  and  it  has  also  helped  to  improve Guam’s housing market.  The extension of  the First-Time Homebuyer  Tax Credit will allow this program to complete  its designed purpose and provide a  longer  term stimulus to the recovering, but still lagging housing market. This  legislation  further  expands the tax credit to current homeowners  who have been in their homes for at least five  years but wish to move to a new residence.  This expansion will provide an additional  incentive for responsible homeowners to participate in this program. The tax credit will further  stimulate the housing market to a point where  more potential buyers will enter the market, in  turn helping  to stabilize and eventually  increase housing prices. The passage of  this  legislation marks an important step toward the  full recovery of our nation’s housing market  and our economy overall.  ",2009

1994,38,2009-11-05,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me just start off by  congratulating  the  gentleman  from  New York. I feel we will have a resolution honoring the Yankees.  I would  just note as a Tigers, Cubs and White  Sox  fan and coming  from Michigan,  Derek Jeter does hail from Kalamazoo,  Michigan. And to his credit, he has not  forgotten his roots. He is a great individual, and we appreciate his prowess  on the field. I congratulate him and the  Yankees as well.  Mr. Speaker, I too want to commend  my colleague, EDMARKEY, and  the  Democratic and Republican Members  on this committee for moving swiftly  on an issue that is of critical importance. Problems abroad have exposed  troublesome flaws here at home in nuclear medicine. Every year, 16 million  medical  procedures  in  the  United  States rely on the import of nuclear  isotope molybdenum-99. That is 50,000  procedures every single day, and yet we  import 100 percent of our supply of this  isotope.  The Canadian reactor that has for  decades supplied over 60 percent of molybdenum-99 is now off-line, and the  nuclear reactor may never ever return  to operation. Among their many medical uses, these isotopes are critical in  the procedures for the detection and  staging of cancer as well as heart disease. Without a proper supply of this  critical isotope, tens of thousands of  patients  seeking diagnosis or  treatment will be in jeopardy literally every  single day.  So what this bill does, it will help insure a reliable supply of the most critical isotopes that are produced here in  the U.S. Today, with the passage of  this bill, we are a step closer to ensuring the tens of thousands of Americans  who  seek  diagnosis  and  treatment  every day promptly receive the care  that they need. Literally, the clock is  ticking, and the well-being of countless  folks continues to hang in the balance.  I would note that there is a good  laundry list of organizations that support  this  legislation,  among  them:  American Association of Physicists in  Medicine; American College of Radiology; American College of Cardiology;  as well as the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.  We don’t want to deny Americans  this long-practiced medical procedure  which we know produces early diagnosis of a good number of diseases, and  we can save countless American lives.  I would urge my colleagues on both  sides to support this. Again,  I congratulate the speed with which our  committee held hearings, moved this  through both the subcommittee and  full committee. Both Mr. WAXMANand  BARTON are to be complimented, and  particularly my  friend, EDMARKEY,  who recognized this very early, and we  worked together to get it to the House  floor.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

I want to  thank Mr. MARKEY for working with  me to include language in the bill that  recognizes the 17 research reactors in  this country that have converted from  highly enriched uranium to  low enriched uranium fuel. One of these reactors  is  in my home State at Washington State University. This reactor  can be used for medical isotope production with the use of highly enriched  uranium.  I would like to clarify with Mr. MARKEYthat the purpose of section 3(a)(3)  which allows reactors that are in the  process of converting from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium fuel to qualify for funds under  this bill. It is my understanding that  this provision  should not be  interpreted as giving any preferences  to  these reactors and that all applicants  for these funds will be given full and  equal consideration.

1998,38,2009-11-05,Mr. MARKEY of Massachusetts.," The  gentleman is correct. Neither this provision nor the bill as a whole give any  preference whatsoever  to any  technology type. The purpose of this provision is to give the Department of Energy the greatest number of options for  dealing with the medical isotope crisis  while also maintaining the incentive  for reactors to convert to low enriched  uranium fuel.  The bill includes several conditions  on reactors using the exemption to ensure that their conversion to low enriched uranium  fuel  is  successful.  I  fully expect the Department of Energy  to give full consideration to every application for these funds, and to do so  in an equitable and technology-neutral  manner.  ",2009
1999,38,2009-11-05,Mr. INSLEE., I would like to thank  the Chair for that clarification and for  working with me on one of those conditions which would make sure that we  have updated status report for reactors  using this exemption.  PARLIAMENTARYINQUIRY  ,2009

DEARCONGRESSMANWAXMAN, On behalf of  GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, I would like to  offer my strong support for House passage of  the American Medical Isotopes Production  Act, introduced by Representative Edward  Markey and Representative Fred Upton.  This bill will provide the resources necessary for the United States to move expeditiously to ensure that an adequate and reliable supply of molybdenum–99 can be produced in the United States, without the use  of highly enriched uranium. Accordingly,  Americans will benefit from a more robust  supply of life-saving diagnostic medical isotopes like molybdenum–99.  GEH is pleased that this legislation has  been introduced. It is in the best interest of  the health and well being of the citizens of  our great nation  that  this  legislation  is  passed. We look forward to working with the  government in bringing a solution to the  medical isotope crisis facing America.  Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.  Sincerely,  LISAM. PRICE.  NUCLEARTHREATINITIATIVES,  Washington, DC, July 20, 2009.  Hon. EDWARDJ. MARKEY,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMANMARKEY, You have  asked for our reaction to your draft American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2009.  I believe this legislation can and will make  an important contribution to reducing commercial use  of highly  enriched uranium  (HEU).  As we know, HEU is the most attractive  raw ingredient for nuclear terrorism, and its  use to produce essential medical  isotopes  constitutes a continuing and dangerous global commerce in HEU. Means are now available to meet the world’s medical isotopic  needs with production technologies that do  not rely on HEU, and conversion of existing  facilities appears achievable  in a span of  seven-to-ten years.  We understand  this  legislation  is principally intended to provide both a legal and  a financial basis to develop domestic isotope  production capacity based on low enriched  uranium (LEU), which removes its proliferation potential. It would also provide for the  elimination of U.S. HEU exports and the  vulnerabilities associated with any transport  of  fissile material. These elements would  constitute significant progress toward reducing nuclear terrorism risks.

2008,45,2009-11-05,Mr. PASCRELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support as an original cosponsor of the Chemical Facility Anti-  Terrorism Act of 2009. We must take  extraordinary  measures  to  defend  America. This is common sense.  I want to thank the chairman of  Homeland Security for all of his work  on the bill, as well as commending  Chairman  and  Chairman  WAXMAN for coming together with one  voice on this critical piece of legislation.  It has to be clear to all of us that this  bill is long overdue and that chemical  OBERSTAR security is one of the greatest vulnerabilities to our homeland security infrastructure. Both sides admit to that  point.  This bill  reauthorizes  the Department of Homeland Security’s authority  to implement and enforce the Chemical  Facility  Anti-Terrorism  Standards  which are currently set to expire in October of 2010. In fact, the bill strengthens these standards in a number of significant ways.  Now, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of what we will be debating this  afternoon—and  getting  the  amendments whenever the heck that happens.  The State of New Jersey is home to  the most dangerous 2 miles in America—the FBI has pointed this out many  times—along the Jersey Turnpike. Because it is the most densely populated  State, with a very large chemical industry presence, I am proud to say that  the State has adopted  some of  the  strongest chemical security standards  in the Nation, and it’s time the Federal  Government caught up. That is why I  am surprised and deeply disappointed  that there are Members of this body  who actually hope to strip the State  preexemption language out of this bill.  We need to raise Federal standards, as  we do in this bill, and not force States  to lower their standards.  The Acting CHAIR  (Mr. SERRANO).  The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",2009

2010,45,2009-11-05,Mr. PASCRELL.," I am also very disappointed that the chemical industry  and Members of this body continue to  raise unnecessary fears about the inherently safer technology assessments.  We have gone over this in testimony  since 2006.  The State of New Jersey has rightfully required chemical facilities to assess for safer technology assessments,  and believe it or not, our State is not  only safer for it, but the sky hasn’t  fallen on the chemical companies in  New Jersey. The truth is that this bill  is not only the best thing for our homeland security, but also the best thing  for the chemical industry, because assuring safety and greater efficiencies is  a tremendous cost saver in the long  run.  Mr. Chairman, this should be a bipartisan issue. We say that protecting the  American people is our number one priority. Now is the moment to prove it.  I urge bipartisan passage of this bill.  ",2009
2011,45,2009-11-05,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this opportunity to address this  legislation, and I want to thank Ranking Member KING for rubbing it in on  the Phillies. I know you’re very pleased  about the Yankees, but at least the  Phillies beat the Mets. That’s all  I  have to say today about that. So with  that, congratulations to the Yankees.  Again, this is a very important piece  of legislation, as we all know. I have  very serious concerns about it for a  number of reasons, but it should be remembered that in 2006, we, Congress,  enacted a law that gave the Department of Homeland Security the authority to regulate chemical facilities.  You’re hearing a lot of talk today  about  inherently  safer  technologies,  and I would like to get into that in just  a moment and what it means. I should  also point out as well that the State of  New Jersey does require IST assessments, but not implementation of IST,  which is quite different. We are going  much further than the State of New  Jersey in this legislation.  It’s important to point out, too, that  I certainly support the Department’s  efforts to secure chemical  facilities,  but unfortunately, I think this legislation is riddled with costly provisions  that go beyond the underlying security  purpose of the bill.  Currently, there are vulnerability assessments that the Department must  do  under  the  current  regulations.  There are about 6,000 vulnerability assessments that must be done. So far,  2,000  have  been  completed,  leaving  about 4,000 vulnerability assessments  that remain. Adding these IST assessments will be enormously costly.  I should also point out that the Department of Homeland Security has no  one on staff who is an expert in these  inherently  safer  technologies,  so  I  wanted to point that out for the record.  We’ve had a lot of testimony, too,  and I want to say something about inherently safer technologies. Testimony  was referenced. There was a statement  from a Scott Berger, who is a director  for the Center  for Chemical Process  Safety. Mr. Berger is an expert in inherently safer technology and  inherently safer design. And as the organization that developed the most widely  used  reference addressing  inherently  safer design, inherently safer processes,  and  lifecycle approach, they are the  leaders. That was  in his testimony.  And he said, What is inherently safer  design,  from his  testimony back  in  June of 2006. He said, Inherently safer  design is a concept related to the design and operation of chemical plants,  and the philosophy is generally applicable  to any  technology.  Inherently  safer design  is not a  specific  technology or set of tools and activities at  this point in its development. It continues to evolve, and specific tools and  techniques  for application of  inherently  safer design are  in  the early  stages of development. And he goes on.  But essentially what he’s saying is  inherently safer technology is a conceptual  framework.  It’s not a technology; it’s an engineering process. Unfortunately, it seems that too many in  Congress are trying to act as chief engineers. We are essentially trying to  tell people how  to produce  certain  types of chemicals and what chemicals  to use.  These are very technical issues. It  will be very costly to implement. It  will affect jobs in this country, and  with unemployment rates approaching  10 percent nationally, I am very concerned about the impact on this.

2013,52,2009-11-05,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support  of  the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act.  Mr. Chairman,  I would  like  to  thank my  friend from California, Chairman WAXMAN, my  friend  from Minnesota, Chairman OBERSTAR,  and my  friend  from Mississippi, Chairman  for  their work  in  bringing  the  Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act  to  the  House  floor. They deserve great credit  for  crafting legislation to improve security at facilities around the country.  One particular concern that this legislation  can help address  is  the risk posed by bulk  quantities of chlorine—one of the most powerful disinfectants available, but a potentially  dangerous chemical when transported by rail  through our neighborhoods en route to wastewater and drinking water utilities and the conventional bleach producers  that often supply  them.  Federal estimates are that a release of chlorine from just one of the 36,000 annual rail car  shipments could result in up to 100,000 casualties. Many water utilities are shifting  to  bleach, which is as effective as a disinfectant  but  less dangerous  to ship, store, and use.  However, bleach made using  conventional  manufacturing process also relies on chlorine  shipped by rail.  I am pleased to have learned that there is  a safer alternative, the use of which I believe  should be greatly expanded. That alternative  is bleach made using only salt, water, and  electricity, eliminating the need to ship chlorine  across the country. This safer bleach is just as  effective as conventional bleach and can be  produced at costs competitive with the cost of  conventional bleach.  This technology is being implemented at locations around the country, including in Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and  in my congressional  district  in Pittsburg, California. Also, Clorox  Corporation just this week announced plans to  shift all of their bleach plants to use a method  that would eliminate the transport of chlorine  by railcar  to  its  facilities across  the country.  The elimination of chlorine transport by rail is  welcomed by security advocates and the railroads  that bear  the  liability  risk  from  transporting chlorine.  H.R. 2868 calls for identification of chemicals of concern and the use of inherently safer  technology by the highest risk water utilities.  Clearly, chlorine is one of these chemicals of  concern—perhaps more than any other chemical used by water utilities.  However, simply changing from chlorine to  bleach as a disinfectant may not solve  the  problem.  Chlorine  railcars  could  continue  to pass  through neighborhoods to the nearby convenGENE  tional bleach manufacturers, who may argue  that the cost for them is too high to shift to a  safer process.  For this reason, I believe that we must look  at the entire supply chain and the procurement  process as we work to eliminate or mitigate  the consequences of a  terrorist attack.  In  order to fully achieve Congress’ intent in passing  this  bill,  the Environmental Protection  Agency and Department of Homeland Security  should work together to evaluate this problem  and develop a policy that will lead to safer utilities and communities by  reducing  the hazardous transport of chlorine.  Once again, I appreciate the work of Chairman WAXMAN, Chairman OBERSTARand Chairman THOMPSONon this bill and I look forward  to working with them and the industry as we  go forward to help reduce the risks associated  with the transportation of chlorine across our  country.

2015,52,2009-11-05,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," I thank  my colleague.  First of all, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 2868. I represent the largest petrochemical  complex  in  the  country.  These  chemical  facilities  contribute  much to our economy and way of life  and the employ thousands of workers  in high-paying, quality jobs.  These chemical  facilities have  invested $8 billion in security improvements since 2001 and are  fully complying with DHS’ Chemical Facilities  Antiterrorism Standards, or CFATS,  that has not been fully implemented.  These dedicated chemical employees,  as well as  the communities around  them, deserve the best security standards possible to prevent another unthinkable act of terrorism on U.S. soil.  When this bill was originally introduced, I had some concerns about it.  Working with both Chairman WAXMAN  and Subcommittee Chairman EDDIE  MARKEYalong with industry and labor  officials, we made a number of changes  in here and I would like to summarize  some of them.  We worked with the Chair to include  new language to clarify that the Coast  Guard would be the main entity enforcing the requirements similar to the  maritime security facilities; provide an  explicit consultative role for the Coast  Guard if the DHS Secretary considers  IST for a maritime security facility;  ensure maritime  security  facilities  would not perform additional background  security  requirements  other  than under CFATS; and identify the  TWIC credential that is being used to  satisfy CFATS would also satisfy this  bill. That’s what’s so important.  Mr. Chair,  I rise  today  in support of H.R.  2868, the Chemical and Water Security Act, a  bill to protect chemical facilities and drinking  water and wastewater systems across  the  country.  The Houston Ship Channel  I represent  is  home to the largest petrochemical complex in  the country. These chemical  facilities contribute much to our economy and way of life  and employ thousands of workers in high-paying, quality jobs.  Chemical  facilities have already  invested  nearly $8 billion  in  security  improvements  since 2001 and are fully complying with DHS’  Chemical Facilities Antiterrorism Standards, or  CFATS, which are not yet fully implemented.  These dedicated chemical employees, as  well as the communities that surround these  facilities, deserve the best security standards  possible to prevent another unthinkable act of  terrorism on U.S. soil.  As introduced, I had several concerns with  H.R. 2868 that were mostly addressed in the  final bill by working with Chairman HENRY  WAXMAN, Subcommittee Chairman EDMARKEY, and industry and labor representatives.  First, granting the DHS Secretary authority  to mandate a facility to perform a ‘‘method to  reduce a consequence of a terrorist attack’’—  or  IST—raises questions as  to whether, or  how, to involve government agencies like DHS  that have few, if any, process safety experts,  chemical engineers and other qualified staff.  We worked to include a fair and transparent  technical appeals process  in H.R. 2868  that  requires DHS to examine such decisions with  facility representatives as well as with experts  knowledgeable in the fields of process safety,  engineering, and chemistry.  In addition,  the scope of affected  facilities  nationwide potentially subject to IST requirements was substantially reduced by focusing  exclusively on chemical facilities in populated  areas subject  to a release  threat, and DHS  may not mandate IST if it were not feasible or  if the facility would no longer be able to continue operations at its location.  Second, H.R. 2868 as  introduced created  unnecessary duplication with existing regulations for chemical facilities already regulated  under  the Maritime Transportation Security  Act, or MTSA.  We worked with  the Chairmen  to  include  new language to clarify that the Coast Guard  will be the main entity enforcing the requirements of this act for MTSA facilities; provide  an explicit  consultative  role  for  the Coast  Guard  if  the DHS Secretary considers mandating IST on a MTSA facility; ensure MTSA  facilities would not have to perform additional  background  security  requirements  under  CFATS; and identify the TWIC credential as  being able to satisfy the CFATS requirements  in the bill.  Third, workers were not afforded a robust  redress process in the case of any adverse  decisions made due to the personnel surety  requirements in the legislation.  We worked  to  include a  ‘‘Reconsideration  Process’’ by which workers could petition DHS  to make a determination as  to whether  the  worker poses an actual terrorist security risk,  as well as  included annual  reports  to Congress assessing much needed background  check and redress process data.  Fourth, the civil suit provisions could have  unnecessarily disclosed sensitive security  information for facilities.  Revised language was included to permit affected citizens the ability to compel agency action on CFATS and provide an avenue for citizens to report facilities in potential violation of  the bill’s requirements while safeguarding sensitive information. No private right of action is  permitted against private companies.  Finally, the original bill failed to streamline  the  regulation of both drinking water and  wastewater  facilities and  lacked an appeals  process  for water systems subjected  to  IST  decisions.

2016,59,2009-11-05,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Chairman, it is  all about jobs today. This bill affects  jobs and the economy. We are close to  9.8 percent unemployment in the manufacturing  sector, and here we are  going to put more, additional burdens  on those who create jobs. If you don’t  have employers, you don’t have employees.  I appreciate my agriculture members  coming down here because  it  is not  about the end users, it is about the producers of the chemicals. It is about the  producers of the anhydrous. Those are  the folks whose costs are going to go  up.  Now I like to come down here and  talk about the hypocrisy of this whole  debate, especially on the Safe Drinking  Water Act, because  if  it really was  about security, and I talked about this  in the Rules Committee, and no one  has answered  this question, on  the  health care bill, Mr. Chairman, your  bill, page 1785, we say this: ‘‘The financial and technical capability of an Indian Tribe, or Tribal Organization, or  Indian community to safely operate,  manage, and maintain a sanitation facility shall not be a prerequisite to the  provision or construction of sanitation  facilities by the Secretary.’’  Your health care bill says if the Indian Tribe cannot safely run a plant,  we are going to build you one anyway.  We are not worried about safety and security.  Page 1785, a financial and technical  capability of an Indian Tribe, shall be  exempt even if they can’t operate safely a water treatment plant. So what  you are doing in the health care bill,  exempting  Indian  tribes who  don’t  know how to manage a refinery, you  are giving them protections  in this  health care bill. But in this bill, municipal water plants pay more; private  water plants pay more; refineries pay  more. Indian tribes under your health  care bill——  ",2009

2019,59,2009-11-05,Mr. SHIMKUS.," I would just say why  would we exempt Indian tribes from  the ability to prove that they can actually operate a water purification plant?  Why would we do that? If safety and security is important, the whole premise  of this bill, why would we exempt Indian tribes? Page 1785 of your bill in  the health care reform. Three hundred  pages on Indian health, not one page  through the committee process. It is an  abomination of the process.  ",2009
2020,59,2009-11-05,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Chairman, I think  you just heard some very powerful arguments in opposition to this legislation. This issue is all about jobs. I want  to say one thing. It is a darn good  thing that the House of Representatives just a couple of hours ago passed  an extension of unemployment benefits. Because of this legislation, people  are going to need them. That said, people around this country are very scared  of Washington  right now. They are  scared of the agenda, and they are  scared of the national energy tax called  cap-and-trade. They are afraid of the  card check bill and the health care bill  that will cost more than a trillion dollars. So is it any wonder that unemployment rates are going the way they  are going.  But one thing about these IST assessments, and I feel we have to talk about  this from a jobs standpoint, but contesting these IST assessments will be  costly, too costly for most small businesses to afford.  Experts estimate that a simple, one  ingredient substitution would take two  persons 2 weeks to complete and cost  between $10,000 and $40,000, and that is  on the low end. A pharmaceutical pilot  plant with about 12 products would  take three to six persons up to 10  weeks to complete an assessment at a  cost of $100,000 to $500,000.  Larger  facilities with  particularly  hazardous chemicals, already regulated  by OSHA, would require 8 to 10 people  6 months or more to complete at a cost  of over a million dollars for the assessment. Fifty-nine percent of the facilities  regulated  under  the  current  CFATS regulations that would be required to conduct these costly assessments employ 50 or fewer people. Mandating IST will be devastating to small  businesses across America.  According to a California fertilizer  manufacturer, eliminating the use of  anhydrous ammonia and substituting  it with urea can cost a 1,000 acre farm  up  to  $15,000  per  application. This  would be a recurring cost passed on to  the consumer.  On Friday, the Department of Labor  is expected to revise the unemployment  figures. Does  anyone  in  this  Chamber expect those numbers to go  down? We hope they do, but I am afraid  we know what the answer may be.  ",2009
2021,59,2009-11-05,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chair, I rise today  to express my strong support for the Chemical  and Water Security Act of 2009. I would also  like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR, Chairman  WAXMAN, and my distinguished colleague on  the Homeland Security Committee, Chairman  THOMPSON, for their hard work in crafting this  vital legislation.  I support this legislation because it will enhance  the security of our nation’s chemical,  drinking water, and wastewater facilities and it  lessens  the vulnerability of our most critical  sectors to a terrorist attack. Specifically, this  legislation:  Protects our nation by making critical infrastructure more secure;  Helps my district by enhancing the security  of its chemical, drinking water, and wastewater  facilities; and  Helps our economy by providing greater  protection  to  the nation’s major  job creating  sectors and by providing  incentives  to spur  production and technological innovation.  I also support H.R. 2868 because it contains  a provision I offered that protects workers who  identify and report violations affecting the safety and security of chemical facilities to management or regulatory authorities from retaliation and reprisal. When it comes to the security of our chemical, drinking water, and wastewater  facilities,  the employees who work  in  them are the ‘‘First Preventers.’’ We depend  on them to be competent, vigilante, and pro-  active. We owe them the assurance that they  will not be penalized for doing their jobs properly. That is why I am pleased the bill also incorporates a provision I offered requiring facility owners to certify in writing their knowledge  of the protections provided whistleblowers and  the Secretary’s power to protect them.  Mr. Chair, eight years ago this September  11 terrorists attacked our country and inflicted  incalculable damage to our people, economy,  and national psyche. We  responded  to  the  horror and trauma of that day by resolving to  honor the victims and heroes of 9–11 by doing  all we can to protect our homeland and our  people from any future attack.  There  is a simple answer  for  those who  question the timing or need for a comprehensive legislation to safeguard these facilities.  The poison gas  leak at Union Carbide’s  Bhopal plant in 1984 that killed 10,000 people  within 72 hours, and more than 25,000 people  since, was an accident! Imagine the carnage  that could result from an intentional act of terrorism or sabotage.  Mr. Chair, the chemical industry alone employs nearly a million Americans and  it accounts  for nearly $600 billion of  the GDP.  More  than 70,000  industrial, consumer, and  defense-related  products—from  plastics  to  fiber optics—are produced by  the nation’s  chemical facilities.  The economic and strategic value of  the  chemical industry makes it an attractive target  to terrorists because many chemicals, either in  their base form or when combined with others,  can cause significant harm  to both humans  and the environment if misused.  My congressional district alone abuts one of  the nation’s largest ports and is home to several major oil refineries, as well as gas treatment and petrochemical facilities. It is, as they  say in the military, a ‘‘target rich environment.’’  So I am not willing to wait. The time has  come for us to approve legislation that puts in  place  the necessary protections and authorizes  the necessary  resources  to keep our  chemical, wastewater, and drinking water facilities secure. This bill does that.  Chemical facilities determined by the Secretary to be at risk are required to conduct a  Security Vulnerability Assessment  (‘‘SSV’’).  Based upon that assessment, the facility must  then develop and  implement a Site Security  Plan (‘‘SSP’’), which is subject to review, approval, and inspection by the DHS Office of  Chemical Facility Security.  The  legislation also authorizes  the DHS  Secretary to require, where appropriate, that  chemical facilities in the highest risk tiers implement  ‘‘methods  to  reduce  the  consequences of a terrorist attack’’ by utilizing ‘‘inherently safer technologies’’ (IST). And it authorizes the Secretary to award $225 million in  grants  to provide  technical assistance and  funding to finance the capital costs incurred in  transitioning to inherently safer technologies.  I am also pleased  to note  that  facilities  around the country have already begun taking  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:35 Jan 30, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD09\H05NO9.REC H05NO9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

2024,66,2009-11-05,Mr.  ROE  of  Tennessee.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Danny Roy Price, who passed away in  October at the age of 69. Danny was my  most dedicated volunteer, a  trusted  staff member; but, most importantly,  he was my friend. He dedicated his life  to his Lord and to the service of others.  There are literally countless stories  of Danny’s sense of duty and commitment to service. He served our country  in the U.S. Army; and because of that,  he had a strong connection to every  man and woman who served our country.  His wife, Carol, spoke of the day he  helped a veteran and his wife receive  benefits to which they were entitled  but had never received. When Danny  informed them their benefits had been  approved, they began to tear up and  weep. Carol said that when Danny returned home that evening, he told her  the story and he too began to weep. I  am incredibly proud to have had a person like him serving east Tennessee.  In  2007, Danny was  named Tennessee’s Statesman of the Year by the  Tennessee House of Representatives. It  was a fitting tribute to Danny, whose  incredible attitude and passion I saw  on display time and time again during  my campaign during 2008 and as we  traveled throughout the district this  past year. Everywhere Danny went, he  was a statesman, greeted and loved by  everyone whose  life he  touched. He  never wanted the credit. He only wanted a sense of satisfaction from knowing  the job that he had done had been done  right.  On the last day I shared with Danny,  we had a full day of meetings in Bull’s  Gap, Gatlinburg, Morristown, Knoxville, and Greeneville, Tennessee, with  a variety of doctors and local businessmen and businesswomen.  But it wasn’t out of the ordinary for  Danny and me. We  finished up, and  Danny told me, Phil, we had a great  day. And it was a good day. To Danny,  a good day wasn’t getting the personal  accolades. A good day was traveling up  and down the district, getting to know  the people, and learning about how he  could help them.  At his eulogy, Danny’s pastor of Hope  Community  Church  in  Rogersville,  Tennessee,  Rip  Noble,  talked  of  Danny’s  service  to his Lord, Jesus  Christ. Danny wanted others to experience the relationship he had with his  Lord, so he constantly invited those he  met to come worship with him. And  then he would make sure that those  people were welcomed into the service,  first by himself, and then by the pastor.  When  regular members hadn’t attended in a while, Danny would call  them and make sure that everything  was all right and invite them back. Indeed, in large part due to Danny’s efforts, the church has over 500 members,  after starting just 5 years ago.  Danny is survived by his wife, Carol;  his children, Jennifer and Brent Price;  his granddaughter, Neyla Price; his  brothers, Admiral Price  and Keith  Price; and his sister, Judy.  I extend our deepest condolences to  the family for their loss, and hope they  can find comfort in the knowledge that  Danny was  an  extraordinary  individual.  f  ",2009

2027,66,2009-11-05,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in opposition to the health care reform bill offered by Speaker PELOSI  and the Democratic leadership, which  we anticipate will be voted on possibly  before the end of this week, and in support of the commonsense, practical alternative offered by Congressman JOHN  BOEHNER, the Republican leader in the  House.  Madam Speaker, this legislation offered by Speaker PELOSI is over 2,000  pages long and contains about 400,000  words. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this government takeover of  the health care system in the United  States, this legislation uses the word  ‘‘shall’’ 3,425 times. When you see the  word ‘‘shall’’ in legislation, you should  read a mandate, a requirement, that  the government is requiring somebody  to do something to comply with what  people here in Washington know best,  not in terms of what people know is  best  for themselves. This  legislation  contains that word 3,425 times. It is  truly a remarkable, complex government takeover.  In the original bill offered earlier  this year, which was 1,000 pages long,  there was the creation of 53 new Federal Government  agencies  and  programs. In the new  improved revised  version, there are now 111 Federal Government agencies and programs contained in this legislation, which will  cost the American taxpayers and our  senior citizens more than $1.1 trillion.  That is the official government estimate. There are many health care experts who say that the implementation  of this  legislation will cost  far,  far  more.  As an example, many have pointed to  the projected cost of Medicare when it  was enacted in 1965. It was projected  that it would cost $10 billion to $12 billion 25 years later; but by the end of  the 1980s, Medicare was actually costing the American taxpayers more than  $100 billion. In fact, today it costs more  than  $400 billion per year; and  the  Speaker’s  proposal  says, well,  let’s  take out of that $400 billion per year.  Let’s take about $40 billion a year, or  10 percent of that, and divert  it to  other new government programs.  Well, Madam Speaker, the problem  with that is that the Medicare program  today  is  faced with enormous challenges. The projected unfunded liability for Medicare over the lifetime of  the average American today is more  than $17 trillion, here at a time when  starting next year senior citizens will  increase in their numbers dramatically  because the baby boomers, those born  in the years after World War II and up  until the early 1960s, will be retiring,  will be  reaching  eligibility age  for  Medicare, and year after year after  year the number of Medicare-eligible  senior citizens will increase dramatically.  At the same time that will be occurring, this Congress is suggesting that it  will be okay to take $400 billion out of  the Medicare program to spend on an  entirely new health care program that  is projected to cost $1.1 trillion over 10  years, and I suggest will cost far more  than that. So Medicare is going to be  jeopardized by this legislation, and senior citizens across  this country are  aware of that.  They certainly were aware of it in  Virginia this year, my home State,  when they turned out on Tuesday in  very large numbers to send a message  to Washington that this health care  proposal and other dramatic government takeovers of sectors of our economy is unacceptable and it resulted in  a sweep across the elections in Virginia. And in the only two States in  the country where  there were Governors races up this year, New Jersey  and Virginia, Democratic Governors  were  replaced  by Republican Governors. People are  looking to Washington.  There is a story in today’s New York  Times  entitled  ‘‘Democrats  to Use  Election to Push Agenda in Congress.’’  Well, good luck with that, because I  can tell you that the people who turned  out at the polls in Virginia were not  asking for this agenda to be pushed forward as a result of what they have been  seeing going on in Washington, D.C. Instead, they want commonsense, bipartisan reforms of health care.

Again, we know that the trials that  led  to approval by  the FDA, when  Kessler was the head of the FDA under  President Clinton, he on bended knee  asked the company that manufactures  RU–486 to bring it here. Sham trials  were conducted where women who were  seriously hurt were not reported. And  we know for a fact, women are actually  dying from RU–486. Probably because  they had the best reporting of any  other State, those women have surfaced in California from those deaths  attributable to RU–486. And it’s baby  pesticide that has serious consequences  for women, including death.  Again, no pharmaceutical company  in America would take up RU–486, the  abortion drug, simply because it was so  dangerous. So they  found the Population Council Company. Try  suing  them when you have egregious harm  done to a woman or a death, a fatality.  It’s  an  organization.  It’s  not  like  Merck or some other because all of  them took a pass because it is so dangerous.  And you held the only hearing, as  you so well pointed out, and I commend the gentleman for them.  I  would  like  to  yield  to Mr.  FORTENBERRY, a good friend and great  champion of human rights as well.  ",2009
2029,73,2009-11-05,Mr. FORTENBERRY.," I thank my colleague Mr. SMITH from New Jersey,  whom I learned a great deal from primarily  about  being  passionate  for  those who are least among us, for being  passionate in the belief that women deserve better than abortion. So I thank  you for your leadership, sir.  I would like to point out what is becoming  increasingly  clear, Madam  Speaker,  that  the health care plan  under consideration would authorize  Federal funding for elective abortion,  even though the majority of Americans  do not want their government funding  that procedure.  Several amendments, as has been discussed, introduced in the committees  of jurisdiction to make sure abortion  funding was explicitly excluded from  the bill all failed. Now it is reported  that there is a so-called abortion funding compromise that I fear is put in  place to draw the support of pro-life  House Members who otherwise, in good  conscience, would not vote for this particular bill.  b1945  This move should not mislead the  American  people.  However  clearly,  cleverly worded the proposal might be,  this plan would authorize a government-run option to fund elective abortion and subsidize private plans that  cover elected abortion. This language  creates a smokescreen by appearing to  offer a restriction on the use of Federal  funds  for abortion while  leaving  in  place the key  legal authority which  says, ‘‘Nothing in the act’’ should be  interpreted  to  ‘‘prevent  the  public  health insurance option from providing  for coverage of elective abortion.’’  The abortion language requires the  public option to hire contractors to ensure that money paid into the government option could potentially be used  to pay for elective abortions. For example, Medicare contracts with private  business to handle claims, but no one  in their right mind would say that  Medicare payments are private payments. They’re government payments.  So this new compromise language is a  hoax.  So, Madam Speaker, I don’t believe  my colleagues should be misled. I also  believe that we should have the opportunity for more dialogue, debate, and  consideration of potential amendments  that could actually strengthen the opportunity for good health care reform  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:35 Jan 30, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\H05NO9.REC H05NO9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009
2030,80,2009-11-05,Mr. ELLISON.," But when the facts  come out, they’re like, Oh, okay, I get  it now. And we just ask people to keep  their minds open.  I  just say that  if the Republicans  have a real alternative around health  care, how come they didn’t come up  with anything in the House from 1994  to 2006? Nothing did they come up with.  Oh, they did veto SCHIP. We’ve got to  give  them  credit  for  that. Vetoed  SCHIP. Vetoed State Children’s Health  Insurance Program; can you imagine  that? Oh, my goodness. I think that  that is not good service to the American people.  I do hope we get some Republican  votes on this bill because I think there  has got to be some Republicans who  say, You know what? Skip all the bickering. The Democrats have been open  to our ideas when we offered them, but  we didn’t offer them because we would  rather beat the Democrats at the polls  than give Americans real health care  reform. Think about that. They would  rather beat the Democrats at the polls  and try to use this as a political thing  rather than say, You know what? We’re  going to do something for the American people. Oh, my goodness.  Let me turn to this poster board I  have here. The Democratic bill—let’s  set the record straight. Here’s a myth:  The Democratic bill will hurt small  businesses. Not true. If you heard it  today or if you hear it later today,  don’t believe it. Small chemical facilities are already regulated by the DHS.  The bill requires DHS to assess potential  impacts of  IST on  small businesses. And $225 billion in grant funding is available for small businesses.  This will interfere with business operations. The fact is is that this bill  will not interfere with business operations, it will not be a boon to plaintiffs’ attorneys, and it will not do any  of these things that are claimed by the  Republicans over and over and over  again.  We hear the Republicans say we need  to have tort reform. Let me just say, if  you have a loved one who has a medical  error, you have a right to go to court  over that. Don’t let anybody scare you  away from your right to go to court  when a doctor or a hospital fails to  meet medical standards.  ",2009
2031,80,2009-11-05,Ms. WATSON., Would you yield?  ,2009
2032,80,2009-11-05,Mr. ELLISON.," Yes, I will.  ",2009
2033,80,2009-11-05,Ms. WATSON.," You know, it’s always  very interesting to me. I sat on the Judiciary Committee for 17 years and I  carried  the California  trial  lawyers’  funding bill every other year. And of  course opposition would say, frivolous.  Well, if your right leg was amputated  and the condition was in the left leg,  they amputated your right  leg, the  first thing you would do is run to get  the most  high-powered  lawyer  you  could and you would sue the doctor and  the hospital out of business. So you  can say frivolous cases, but when it  comes  to your own health and  the  health  of  your  loved  ones—and  I  haven’t seen a company without its set  of lawyers. So we use them when we  want to be sure that the law works on  behalf of ourselves and our loved ones.  If it’s for somebody else, it’s frivolous.  So let’s think about what we’re saying  with tort reform.  And we can lower the cost if we have  quality health care, meaning we have  quality personnel. And do you know  there are provisions in our bill that  will help to subsidize medical students  that want to go into primary care? And  so we want to build a whole cadre of  quality health providers that will practice medicine on behalf of the human  interest to keep our people healthy.  So when we talk about tort reform,  let’s think it all the way through and  don’t treat it in a frivolous way.  Thank you very much, and good  night.  ",2009
2034,80,2009-11-05,Mr. ELLISON.," Well,  let me  just  thank the gentlelady for that, because  the reality is that Republicans are saying, Oh, we have a plan on tort reform  and we want to give tax cuts and tax  breaks—they’ve  been  talking  about  fragments of their plan for a long time,  but when the reality of their plan came  out,  it was pretty dismal.  I mean,  here’s what Ezra Klein says, of the  Washington  Post:  Republicans  are  learning  an  unpleasant  lesson  this  morning. The only thing worse than  having no health care reform plan is  releasing a bad one, getting thrashed  by the CBO, and making the House  Democrats look good.  We want to thank you for that.  The Democratic bill covers 12 times  as many people and saves $36 billion  more than the Republican plan. The  New York Times, the Budget Monitor  says: GOP leaves many uninsured.  Again, the Congressional Budget Office  said Wednesday  that  the alternative health care bill put forward by  House Republicans would have  little  impact on extending health benefits to  roughly 30 million uninsured Americans. You can go right down the ranks,  but piece after piece shows that this  Republican plan that they released is  abysmal.  I want to have some conversation  about  the Republican plan, because  they’ve been beating up on the Democratic plan from the very beginning,  yet it has gone through three committees. It has had a merger process. It has  been beaten and smashed and attacked,  and yet, still, still the Democratic bill  is far and away superior to the Republican plan, maintains its public option.  The fact is I think the American people  are really going to start seeing who is  looking out for their health.  Let me turn now to a few health care  stories if I may.  A good friend, Amy. Amy says, ‘‘I’m  a graduate student working part-time  at a restaurant. I applied for individual  health insurance through Medica, hoping to pay their nice low rate, $99 a  month for a pretty good plan and a  fairly low deductible; however, Medica  denied my  individual application because I marked on my application that  I have anxiety and take medication for  it. It is a little ironic; not having insurance gives me more anxiety.  ‘‘I was recently approved for group  health insurance through a company  that owns the restaurant I work for.  However, to stay on the group plan, I  have  to maintain a workload of  24  hours a week on average over a year,  which can be hard to do as a full-time  student.  This  group  insurance  is  through Medica, and I will be paying  $95 each month, which is affordable for  me. However, I got a letter from Medica saying that my anxiety is considered a preexisting condition, so any  treatment or medication for it will not  be covered for a year. After 1 year, I  can appeal for coverage. In the meantime, I will continue to pay for my  medication out of pocket and not go to  therapy because it will be too expensive.  ‘‘Please pass Federal health care reform that includes a public health insurance option that  is affordable to  middle-income families in Minnesota.’’  This young lady would not be barred  from getting health care insurance because of her anxiety, which the insurance company called a preexisting condition, yet under the Republican plan  she still would be.

2035,87,2009-11-05,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, we have just a few minutes left.  This bill that we are talking about,  H.R. 3962, this bill that we will be voting on on Saturday, this massive increase in bureaucracy, when it came  through  the Energy  and Commerce  Committee, I counted that it had 53  czars. I think we are up to 120 now. But  the most egregious of all the czars that  have been created through this bureaucratic bill is someone called the health  choices administrator.  Now  the  health  choices  administrator is the person who is going to say  what has to be in every health plan.  That is why I was talking about driving up the prices  for the youth of  America, and why we are robbing from  their present as well as their future.  This health choices administrator  is  going to be more powerful than the Social Security administrator. They are  going to decide not only are we going  to force you to buy insurance or we are  going to charge you a 2 percent fine,  maybe put you in jail, or force your  employers  to  provide  insurance  for  your employees or fine you 8 percent,  or maybe put you in jail, too. The person that is making those decisions on  what type of plan is offered, and, Mr.  Speaker, I am sure these low-premium,  high-deductible  health  savings  accounts are the types that young people  love because it gives them protection  against ‘‘horrendoplasty,’’ as we call it  in medicine, a terrible car accident  which causes them to lose a limb, and  every bit of  their  financial wherewithal.  Here on this slide is a caricature of  the health choices administrator. The  gentleman  from Georgia  recognizes  him because he ran Hazard County,  Georgia. His name was Boss Hogg.  Some may be too young to remember  the ‘‘Dukes of Hazard,’’ but Boss Hogg,  he made all of the decisions. He was  the health choices administrator. And  Boss Hogg says, kind of like Big Boss  Hogg says, the President of the United  States, you can have whatever you like  as long as the boss approves it. As long  as the boss approves it.  Let me just conclude by saying the  people that came up here today had a  prescription for America, and they told  us, and I had one, too. I had it in my  pocket, I just didn’t have a chance to  share it.  Here  is my 10 prescriptions  healthy America:  No government-run health care plan.  No cuts to senior care.  No new deficit spending. The President promised that.  No new taxes. That is in the Republican bill.  for a  No  rationing of care. The  seniors  don’t want to get thrown under the  bus, but they will under H.R. 3962.  No employer mandate. It is unconstitutional to force them. We want to encourage them. We want to lower the  prices, as the Republican bill does, so  they can get health care insurance, but  in a voluntary way.  And we don’t want to have taxpayer-  funded coverage for illegal immigrants.  And we don’t want to pay for abortions with taxpayer dollars.  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience. We will  be  back  tomorrow  night. God bless you and good evening.  f  LEAVE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:  ",2009

2038,94,2009-11-05,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North  Carolina,  Senator HAGAN,  for  convening  this  important  session  this  morning where we will talk about the  urgent need to reform health care in  our country.  The unsustainable growth in health  care costs and lack of stable, affordable  coverage  for millions  of Americans  continue to jeopardize not only our Nation’s  fiscal well-being but also the  physical well-being of our families and  neighbors. One of the key ways we can  help put our health care system and  our economy on the right track is by  encouraging value in the delivery of  health care.  I have cited these numbers before—I  know many of us have—but I want to  emphasize them again. As a nation, we  spend over  $2  trillion per year on  health care—that is nearly one-fifth of  our economy. Yet between 30 and 50  percent of these dollars are not contributing  to  better  patient  health.  That is not a good deal for the American people.  Health reform is designed to address  this staggering amount of waste in a  number of ways. One way is to encourage providers to focus on the quality of  care they provide and not just on the  volume. And we can start with Medicare.  I think the American people would  agree that taxpayer dollars are better  spent rewarding doctors for keeping patients healthy and not for performing  more tests or more procedures. Health  reform legislation can move us in this  direction through the development of  what are known as accountable care  organizations, or ACOs. These organizations would  encourage  groups  of  health care professionals to team up  and provide more coordinated, streamlined care to Medicare patients. The  idea is to have these ACOs take responsibility  for  improving  patient  care  while lowering cost and then sharing  the savings that accrue. Research indicates that this idea of shared savings  would help eliminate waste and spur  changes  in our health care delivery  system to emphasize patient outcomes  and value.  The  idea  for ACOs no doubt came  from the great work being done by a  patchwork of physician groups. Groups  such as the Physician Health Partners,  or PHP, in my home State of Colorado,  and others across the country focused  on care coordination and quality.  For example, PHP has seen great success  in  improving care  for kids suffering from asthma—the No. 1 cause of  child hospitalization and  school absence.  They  developed  treatment  guidelines and promoted collaboration  among doctors, the Children’s Hospital  in Denver, and the Colorado Allergy  and Asthma Centers. As a result, they  have reduced emergency room visits  and improved families’ ability to manage asthma on their own.  PHP also has the Practice Health  Project.  This  comprehensive  effort  brings doctors together to share best  practices and encourage the adoption  of commonsense guidelines to improve  quality and efficiency. The goal of this  team effort is to raise the standard and  value of care and allow these physician  groups to act as a model for Denver’s  physician community as a whole.  I would also like to tout the PHP’s  Transitions of Care Program  in collaboration with Denver’s St. Anthony  Hospital and other local care providers.  The program dispatches nurse coaches  to help Medicare patients make the  transition from the hospital to their  homes. The period  immediately  following a hospital stay is a very confusing time, particularly for our seniors. Having someone help with this  transition is crucial. PHP has had tremendous early success with this program, showing the potential to reduce  costly hospital readmissions by 40 to 50  percent. At the same time, this program keeps patients healthy and  it  saves money.  The successes of groups such as Physician Health Partners  demonstrate  that we already have the will and the  know-how to change our system for the  better. But under our existing system  there is no incentive for programs like  PHP to even exist. Under the status  quo, a hospital stands to lose money if  it decreases its admission rates. Primary care doctors would be at a financial disadvantage if they spent time in  the development and implementation  of effective treatment plans for their  asthmatic patients.  This is why health reform includes  commonsense proposals  such as  encouraging groups  such as Physician  Health Partners to form accountable  care organizations and paying them to  coordinate care for Medicare patients.  Promoting ACOs and other creative  pro-consumer ideas will increase quality for patients and value for the taxpayer.  Only by reshaping the way we do  business in our health care system can  we truly change health care delivery in  our country. I look forward to working  with my colleagues here  today and  other Senators in the coming weeks to  promote the many ways we can accomplish that goal.  I thank Senator HAGAN, and I yield  the floor.  ",2009
2039,94,2009-11-05,Mrs.  HAGAN.,"  I  thank  Senator  UDALL. Accountable care organizations  are extremely important in health care  reform.  Mr. President, I would like to yield 5  minutes to my colleague from Delaware, Senator TEDKAUFMAN, to discuss  Delaware’s  health  information  network.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.  ",2009
2040,94,2009-11-05,Mr. KAUFMAN.," First, Mr. President,  I want to thank Senator HAGAN not  just for putting this on but for her  leadership all along on health care reform, and I look forward to working  with her because of her great leadership. I appreciate the opportunity to  join my colleagues on the floor to highlight health care  innovations  in our  home States that can serve as models  for national reform.  Delaware  is  a national  leader  in  health  care  IT—information  technology—and I want to take a couple of  minutes this morning to talk about a  truly  innovative approach to health  care record keeping in my State. It is  called the Delaware Health Information Network.  The Delaware Health  Information  Network, which we call DHIN, was authorized 12 years ago and went live in  2007, becoming  the  first operational  statewide  health  information  exchange. A public-private partnership of  physicians,  hospitals,  laboratories,  community  organizations,  and  patients, the DHIN provides for the fast,  secure, and reliable exchange of health  information among the State’s many  medical providers. As a result of its  early success, the DHIN was one of the  nine  initial health  information  exchanges selected to participate in the  U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services’ national health information  network trial implementations. Among  those nine, it was the first State to  successfully  establish  a  connection  with the trial.  Right now, more than 50 percent of  all  providers  in  the  State—nearly  1,300—participate  in the DHIN. More  than 85 percent of all lab tests are entered into the network, and 81 percent  of all hospitalizations are captured by  the exchange. As of June of this year,  the DHIN held over  648,000 patient  records, and  it conducts  40 million  transactions a year.  Participating providers have a choice  of three options to receive lab, pathology, and radiology reports, as well as  admission face sheets: they can have  them sent directly into a secure in-box,  similar to an e-mail account, they can  have them faxed to their office, or they  can get the results from an electronic  medical records interface on the Web.  All  three provide  information  in a  timely manner that protects the privacy of the patient.  Our State of Delaware receives four  very tangible benefits from DHIN, and  these are listed on this chart.  First, the DHIN provides a communication system between providers and  organizations—something that did not  exist previously. Individual physician  offices can now easily discover if hospitals, such as Christiana, Bayhealth,  and Beebe Medical Center, have admitted their patients. Doctors and hospitals can also get  lab results back  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:52 Nov 05, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G05NO6.002 S05NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
2041,101,2009-11-05,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I am  sorry the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia, has to listen to me  twice on the same subject.  When I am referring to a bill, I am  referring to the 2,000-page House bill.  Small business is very vital to the  health of our economy. The President  and I agree that 70 percent of new private sector jobs are created by small  business. Small business is the employment machine of the American economy. However, where the President and  I differ  is,  I believe small business  taxes should be lowered, not raised, to  get our economy back on track. You  will hear  from my discussion,  this  2,000-page bill raises taxes on small  business.  The President and my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have proposed increasing the top marginal tax  rates from 35 percent to 39.6 percent,  respectively. We can see that on the  chart under the proposed Obama budget, 39.6 percent is where they would  raise them. They have also proposed increasing the tax rates on capital gains  and dividends to 20 percent and providing for an estate tax rate as high as  45 percent and an exemption of that estate tax of $3.5 million. Also, the President and congressional Democrats have  called for fully reinstating the personal  exemption phase-out. I will refer to the  personal exemption phase-out as PEP.  They would do that for those making  more than $200,000 a year. In addition,  they have called for fully reinstating  the limitation on itemized deductions,  which is known as Pease after a former  Congressman Pease of Ohio, for those  making also more than $200,000.  Under the 2001 tax  law, PEPs and  Pease are scheduled to be completely  phased out in 2010. That means the tax  rate  for current 35-percent-rate taxpayers would go up, as we can see on  the chart, to 41 percent. For the vast  majority of people who earn less than  $200,000, raising taxes on high earners  might not sound so bad. However, this  means many small businesses will be  hit with a higher tax bill. From the  standpoint of it being where they create 70 percent of the new jobs, that is  bad not only for those taxpayers, that  is bad for the entire economy.  As if this was not bad enough for  small business, the tax increases I have  already talked about, the House Democrats, in this 2,000-page health care reform bill, have proposed a new surtax  of 5.4 percent. With this small business  surtax, a  family of  four  in the top  bracket will pay a marginal tax rate of  46.4 percent by the year 2011. So we go  from current law of 35 percent to automatically,  if Congress doesn’t  intervene, 39.6 percent; and then eliminate  the PEPs and Pease, 41 percent; and  then do what the House Democrats  want to do, 46.4 percent, a marginal tax  rate that is very high and very negative to employment by small business.  This tax change would result, cumulatively, in an increase of marginal tax  rates of 33 percent, a 33-percent  increase over what taxes people pay right  now.  Owners of the many small businesses,  whether regular—which could be so-  called C corporations—or other entities  that receive dividends or realize capital gains, would face a 25-percent rate  increase under this House bill. So we  have a 15-percent capital gains rate  today on dividends going up almost 70  percent by January 1, 2011.  Campaign promises are pretty important. Candidate Obama pledged on the  campaign trail that:  Everyone in America—everyone—will pay  lower taxes than they would under rates Bill  Clinton had in the 1990s.  That is quite a promise. That is good  for business, if it is lower than what  Bill Clinton had. The small business  surtax proposed by House Democrats,  however, violates President Obama’s  pledge he made as a candidate. Therefore, I want Members to know I stand  with President Obama in opposing the  small  business  surtax  proposed  by  House Democrats in this bill, this 2,000-  page bill.  According to the National Federation  of Independent Businesses—they made  a survey—their data shows that 50 percent of the owners of small businesses  that employ 20 to 249 workers would  fall into the top bracket. The red bar  shows 50 percent of all small employers  fall into that bracket. According to the  Small Business Administration, about  two-thirds of the Nation’s small business workers are employed by small  businesses with 20 to 500 employees.  Do we want to raise taxes on these  small businesses that create new jobs  and employ  two-thirds of all  small  business workers?  In his radio address a few months  ago, the President noted small businesses are hurting. They are hurting  because we are helping Wall Street, but  we are not helping Main Street with all  the things we are doing in Congress. Of  course, there is no argument from this  side of the aisle on that point.  President Obama recognized in that  speech the credit crunch on small businesses continues, despite hundreds of  billions in bailout money to big banks.  With these small businesses already  suffering from the credit crunch, do we  want to think it is wise to hit them  with a double whammy of a 33-percent  increase in their marginal tax rate?  Just  yesterday, we  received  data  from the nonpartisan official congressional tax scorekeepers, the Joint Committee on Taxation, that said $1 out of  every $3 raised by the massive $461 billion House surtax—and that is in this  2,000-page bill—would come from small  businesses. That is a conservative, a  very  conservative  estimate  because  other kinds of income that these business owners receive, such as capital  gains and dividends, are not included in  that figure.  If the proponents of the marginal  rate increase on small business owners  agree that a 33-percent tax increase for  half—half—the small businesses that  employ two-thirds of all small business  workers is not wise, then they should  either oppose these tax  increases or  present data that shows different results.  This House bill of 2,000 pages and the  surtax included in it piles on the heavy  taxes small businesses will face. In a  time when many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, does it make sense  to  impose an additional burden on  them by raising their taxes? Odds are,  they will cut spending. In other words,  the small businesses will cut spending.  They will cancel orders for new equipment, cut health insurance for their  employees, stop hiring, and lay off people.  Instead of seeking to raise taxes on  those who create jobs in our economy,  our policies need to focus on reducing  excessive tax and regulatory barriers  that stand in the way of small businesses and the private sector making  investments,  expanding  production,  and creating sustainable jobs—creating  sustainable jobs, which is what I refer  to as small business being the job-creating miracle of our economy.  So I want you to know, regardless of  this 2,000-page House bill, with these  big tax increases in it, I will continue  to fight to prevent a dramatic tax increase on our Nation’s job engine, the  small businesses of America.  I hope my friends on the other side of  the aisle will follow accordingly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the Joint  Committee on Taxation, backing up  some of  the  figures  I used  in my  speech, be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  JOINTCOMMITTEEONTAXATION,  Washington, DC, November 3, 2009.

For purposes of this analysis, business income consists of income from sole proprietorships (Schedule C); farm income (Schedule F); and income from rental real estate,  royalties, partnerships,  subchapter S corporations, estates and trusts, and real estate  mortgage investment conduits (Schedule E),  as would be reported on lines 12, 17, and 18 of  the 2008 Form 1040.

Under  the  ‘‘Affordable Health Care  for  America Act,’’ a 5.4-percent surtax would be  imposed on adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) in  excess of $500,000 ($1,000,000 in the case of a  married taxpayer filing a joint return).

2042,108,2009-11-05,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Maryland.  ,2009
2043,108,2009-11-05,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I object to the Senator’s amendment, and I  object to the arguments he has made.  First of all, we adopt cloture so that  we can proceed on amendments that  are germane. Second, in terms of the  inaccurate  accusation  that we  are  plowing ahead and forging forward, we  were on this bill for 4 days, with over 20  hours of debate. There was plenty of  time to talk about this amendment,  and I was here and ready to engage.  The other thing is that there have  been other times—since my bill was  pulled from the floor—called morning  business, when a Senator could talk for  any length of time on any topic he or  she wants. Yet silence, silence, silence.  So don’t use the cloture vote as a way  to say there wasn’t enough time.  Now let’s go to being asleep at the  switch. Two accusations were made—  the ballooning of the census cost. Well,  one of the reasons and the main reason  the cost is exploding is that the party  in power prior to 2008 was asleep at the  switch with  the census. They completely dropped the ball on the new  technology for being able to go door to  door to get a count. It turned into a big  techno-boondoggle. It finally took the  Secretary of Commerce to uncover that  under that rock was another rock, and  under that rock were a lot of buckets  of malfunctioning microchips. So we  had to bail out Secretary Gutierrez and  the census because of the techno-boondoggle because the other party was  asleep at the switch  in maintaining  strict quality controls.  Now let’s go to the asking of another  question. The Senator from Louisiana  says he wants to stand up for his State.  I agree, we have to stand up for the  States, but the time to stand up was in  April of 2007. Did you know that the  Census is mandated by law to submit  the questionnaires  to Congress—and  they did? So for 1 year, from April 1,  2007, to the close of the review by Congress 1 year later, April 2008, there was  plenty of time to say: We don’t like the  questionnaire; we want to add a citizenship question. That was the time  and the place. When you are going to  stand up for your State, stand up at  the right time to make a difference and  not try to amend the law in a way that  is  going  to  create  administrative  havoc.  We can debate the merits of the question, but I am here as an appropriator  on the process. The Census Bureau did  meet  its statutory responsibility.  It  submitted  the  questionnaire  to  the  Congress on April 1, 2007. It did not  come by stealth in the night, it was  not written  in  invisible  ink,  it was  written in English here for all to see—  and also in other languages we could  test and use—to say: Do you, Congress,  like this questionnaire? Do you have  any comments? For all those who want  to stand up, that was the time to do it  and the time to make a change.  Let’s talk about the consequences. It  will delay the census so we could essentially  not meet  our  constitutional  mandate of having the census done in a  timely way. No. 2, it will cost, if we did  not do it, another $1 billion and wreak,  again, administrative havoc.  Let’s go into this whole claim about  citizens and noncitizens. The census already tracks the number of citizens  and noncitzens through a separate survey. We could talk about what this will  mean in reapportionment and so on.  Those questions are for debates that lie  with the Judiciary Committee.  We are not going to vote up or down  on the Vitter amendment, we are going  to vote on cloture. Why is cloture important? So we do not have distracting  amendments that are better offered on  the appropriate substance of the bill.  We have to fund the State, Commerce,  Justice, Science  agencies. The FBI  needs us to fund this agency. The Marshals Service needs us to  fund this  agency. Federal law enforcement, our  Federal prisons—you might not  like  whom the Obama administration puts  in Federal prisons, but we need Federal  prisons. So we need to pass cloture so  we can dispose of germane amendments  and move democracy forward.  Mr. President, how much time do I  have?  ",2009

2060,129,2009-11-05,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  I  would like to speak, briefly, in support  of Senator GRAHAM’s amendment dealing with the trial of 9/11 terrorists in  Federal court. It, in effect, would prohibit the administration  from doing  that by denying funding for any such  trials.  This is a very important matter. One  of the things we learned when 9/11 occurred was that this country had made  a mistake in treating people who are at  war with the United States, who attempt to destroy the United States, as  normal criminals and that they should  be tried in court.  We learned the only effective way to  deal with persons such as that is to  treat them as prisoners of war or unlawful combatants, who are people who  violate the rules of war—and all these  individuals do, basically, with the way  they conduct themselves. So we would  try them according to military commissions. The Constitution makes reference to military commissions. They  can be tried fairly in that method without all the rules and procedures we  cherish so highly in Federal courts for  the trials of normal crimes that people  are accused of in this country.  I spoke about al-Marri just last week,  who came to the United States on September 10. He had met bin Laden. He  had been to a training camp in Afghanistan. He had a goal, pretty clearly, to  participate in an attack on the United  States. He seemed to be a part of that  entire effort. He came 1 day before 9/11.  He was tried by a Federal judge who  apparently gave a conviction but sentenced him to, in effect, 7 years. He had  training in bomb making and that kind  of thing. He had done other acts that  indicated an intent to kill American  people, innocent civilians, in a surreptitious way, contrary to the laws of  war. So as a result of that, I think he  should have been tried by a military  commission, and he was not.  As one of the professors said in commenting on this case, it raises questions about the ability of our normal  Federal court system to try these people who may be subject to having the  courthouse attacked in an attempt to  free them. Jurors may feel threatened  because they are willing to kill to promote their agenda—or their allies are.  Courthouses have to be armed with  guards all around and with people on  top of the courthouse to protect the  courthouse throughout the trial.  They can be tried effectively by military commissions. So Senator GRAHAM  is serving the national interest in raising this issue. It is not a little bitty  matter. It is correct. He has a good  idea about it. He has focused it narrowly on the 9/11 issue and on those  who  participated  in  that  attack.  I  think that is at least what we should  do today.  We need to have a sincere analysis of  the determination by this administration to try more and more cases in  Federal court when they have been  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:42 Nov 06, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G05NO6.058 S05NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

2077,157,2009-11-05,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise before you today to speak about a population that is all too often forgotten in  the  poorest  corners  of  our world;  women and children. A woman’s pregnancy should be a joyous time in her  life. Sadly, in many developing countries countless women suffer from pregnancy-related injuries, infections, diseases, and disabilities often with lifelong  consequences. Too  often  their  children die or struggle from a lack of  basic childhood medical care.  Over the years I have traveled to  some of  the poorest corners of  the  world, from Congo to Haiti. I have seen  those who struggle to find food and  water, battle AIDS, TB and malaria,  and fight every day to eke out a living  against great odds.  Yet one of  the most  fundamental  struggles I have witnessed is that of a  mother and child surviving pregnancy  and childbirth. It is heartbreaking to  hear stories of women who have been in  labor  for days before being able to  reach a hospital, of those who die giving birth because of a lack of basic  medical facilities, of the thousands of  children who could be saved with low  cost vitamin A supplements, or of the  thousands of children left as orphans.  What could be a more fundamental  need in our world than making sure  women and children survive childbirth?  Reducing child mortality and  improving maternal health make up two  of the eight United Nations Millennium  Development Goals. While progress has  been made in many countries, an effort  to reduce under-five mortality by two-  thirds and improve maternal mortality  to achieve MDG targets has made the  least progress than any of the other  MDG’s.  That is why Senators DODD, CORKER  and I introduced the Global Child Survival Act of 2009.  This  legislation  is about strengthening the U.S. Government’s role in  saving the lives of children and mothers in poor countries. The act would require the U.S. Government to develop a  strategy for supporting the improvement of newborns, children, and mothers.  Across the developing world, mothers  are dying giving birth from complications such as hemorrhaging, sepsis, hypertensive  disorders,  and  obstructed  labor. Each year, more than half a million women die from causes related to  pregnancy and childbirth.  The sad reality is that most of these  complications have easy and preventable solutions. In fact, if women had  access to basic maternal health services, an estimated 80 percent of maternal deaths could be prevented.  Key interventions, such as adequate  nutrition, antenatal care, skilled attendance at birth and access to emergency obstetric care when necessary,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:18 Nov 06, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A05NO6.033 S05NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
2078,164,2009-11-05,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay special tribute to an outstanding community leader, the Reverend John (Jack) Sharp of Baltimore,  MD. Reverend Sharp served as pastor  of the Govans Presbyterian Church for  27 years. He has distinguished himself  by reaching far beyond his parish to  the entire Baltimore community as a  visionary and activist determined to  move people and social programs from  inaction to accomplishment.  Reverend Sharp’s mission had always  been to aid the poor and the most vulnerable citizens. His boldness of purpose and tenacity, coupled with a winning and commanding personality, enabled him to unite diverse people to  work for a common good. Few community activists can match his accomplishments. During his career, he encouraged neighborhoods to accept and  embrace housing for the mentally ill  and the homeless. In 1991, he founded  the Govans Ecumenical Development  Corporation, GEDCO, and he has become one of Baltimore’s most dynamic  and expansive nonprofit developers of  senior housing and supportive services  for those with special needs.  GEDCO projects and facilities are numerous, providing housing and services  for the mentally ill and the homeless—  including men and women with HIV/  AIDS—a large community pantry, financial assistance, and  job development and mentoring. Jack Sharp  is  most proud of the development of his  grand vision, Stadium Place, a state-  of-the-art senior residential campus on  the grounds of the old Memorial Stadium. The campus is home to four independent living buildings for retirees, an  intergenerational and interfaith community ‘‘Y’’ and playground, and shovel-ready plans for an innovative Green  House long-term care residential facility.  Reverend Sharp accomplished all of  this while serving as a pastor; president of the Board of Community Housing Associates of the Baltimore Mental  Health Systems, Inc; president of the  Glen Meadows Retirement community;  and treasurer of the Baltimore Interfaith Hospitality Network. In 2008, he  was honored with the Governor’s Leadership  in Aging Award and the National Football League—Ravens—Community Quarterback Award for Community Service.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and applauding Jack Sharp  for all that he has accomplished to improve the lives of citizens in Baltimore.  He made their challenges his challenge  and he has made Baltimore City a better place in which to live.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 11:21 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the  following bill, in which it requests the  concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 3639.

2079,178,2009-11-05,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today with my  colleagues Senator  WEBB, Senator LINCOLN, and Senator  to introduce the Cold War  Medal Act of  2009. This  legislation  would provide the authority  for the  secretaries of the military departments  to award Cold War Service Medals to  the courageous American patriots who  for nearly half-a-century defended the  Nation,  and  indeed,  freedom-loving  peoples throughout the world, against  the advance of communist ideology.  From the end of World War II to dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991,  the Cold War veterans were in the vanguard of this Nation’s defenses. They  manned the missile silos, ships, and  aircraft, on ready alert status or on far  off patrols, or demonstrated their resolve in hundreds of exercises and operations worldwide. The  commitment,  motivation, and fortitude of the Cold  War Veterans was second to none.  Astonishingly, no medal exists  to  recognize the dedication of our patriots  who so nobly stood watch in the cause  of promoting world peace. Although  there have been instances where medals or  ribbons,  such as  the Armed  Forces Expeditionary Medal, Korean  Defense Service Medal, and Vietnam  Service Medal, have been issued, the  vast majority of Cold War Veterans did  not receive any medal to pay tribute to  their dedication and patriotism during  this extraordinary period in American  history. It is only fitting that these  brave servicemembers who served honorably during this era receive the recognition for their efforts in the form of  the Cold War Service Medal.  Specifically, the Cold War Service  Medal Act of 2009 would allow the Defense Department to issue a Cold War  Service Medal to any honorably discharged veteran who served on active  duty for not less than two years or was  deployed for thirty days or more during the period from September 2, 1945,  to December 26, 1991. In the case of  those veterans who are now deceased,  the medal could be issued to their family or representative, as determined by  the  Defense  Department.  The  bill  would also express the sense of Congress  that  the  secretary of Defense  should expedite the design of the medal  and expedite the establishment and implementation mechanisms to facilitate  the issuance of the Cold War Service  Medal.  The award of the Cold War Service  Medal is supported by the American  Cold War Veterans, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  and many other veterans’ services organizations.  With November 9, 2009, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  which marked the beginning of the end  of the Cold War, quickly approaching,  Senator WEBB, Senator LINCOLN, Senator LANDRIEU, and I invite our colleagues to cosponsor this significant  legislation to honor our Cold War Veterans.  f  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS  SENATE RESOLUTION  338—DESIGNATING NOVEMBER  14,  2009, AS  ‘‘NATIONAL  READING  EDUCATION ASSISTANCE DOGS DAY’’  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. MCCASKILL, Mr. COCHRAN,  and Mr. RISCH) submitted the following  resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary:  S.

The R.E.A.D. program was the first  literacy program in the country to use  therapy animals as reading companions  for children.

2081,199,2009-11-05,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Chair, I rise today in support  of H.R. 3639—the Expedited CARD Act of  2009. This  important piece of  legislation will  continue  the great work  that  this Congress  and the President completed earlier this year,  by moving up the remaining dates on the original Credit CARD Act.  Since signing the CARD Act into law, credit  card companies have engaged  in  last-ditch  predatory practices, seeking to gain as much  money as possible  from  the American consumer. Many of the same practices that the  Federal Reserve labeled ‘‘unfair or deceptive’’  and were prohibited in the original CARD Act,  have increased in past months. In fact, since  last May, credit card companies have raised  interest rates by an average of 20 percent.  When  this  law was  passed,  this  body  warned credit card companies that swift action  would be taken if these companies took advantage of  the staggered  implementation of  the bill. It is clear these companies have done  just that, and we are now prepared to follow  through on our promise.  I want to thank Mrs. MALONEYand Chairman  FRANK for their hard work on this issue and I  am proud to be a cosponsor on this important  piece of legislation.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this  bill.  f  HONORING ROBERT WAMPLE  HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 5, 2009  ",2009
2082,199,2009-11-05,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  to commend and congratulate Robert  Wample upon his retirement as the director of  the Viticulture and Enology Research Center  and the chair of the Department of Viticulture  and Enology at California State University,  Fresno. Dr. Wample was honored on September 19, 2009 at a fundraising event for the  Robert L. Wample Viticulture and Enology Endowment Fund in support of the Jordan College of Agricultural Sciences and Technology.  Dr. Wample served in the United States Marine Corps from 1962 until 1966. Upon separating from the military, he began his college  education. In 1971, he graduated cum laude  from the University of Idaho with a Bachelors  of Science degree in Botany. While attending  college he worked as a Research Technician  for  the United States Department of Agriculture at the Forest Service research center  in Idaho. Dr. Wample continued his education  at  the University of Calgary  in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where he earned his Ph.D. in  Plant Physiology. His teaching career began  while in Calgary; while completing his Ph.D.  he was a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the  University.  After earning his Ph.D., Dr. Wample served  as a Postgraduate Scholar  for  the National  Research Council of Canada.  In 1976, he  moved to southern California to take an Associate Professor of Botany position with California State University, Fullerton. After  two  years, he moved to Washington State University where he was an Associate Professor of  Horticulture  and Assistant Horticulturist  for  nine years. In 1993, he became a Professor,  Horticulturist and Viticulturist  for  the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Washington State University. In 2000,  Dr. Wample found his way to California State  University, Fresno. Over the past nine years,  he has served as the Julio Gallo Chair and Director of the Viticulture and Enology Research  Center, as well as the Chair of the Department  of Viticulture and Enology.  Prior  to Dr. Wample  joining CSU Fresno,  the viticulture and enology had been operating  independently of each other  for  fifty years.  Under his leadership, the two programs were  merged together to become the first California  State University to combine the two research  and academic programs. The merge has had  great success,  including  the  recognition of  CSU Fresno as a global agricultural education  prominence. Further, during Dr. Wample’s tenure,  the program has  raised well over  five  hundred thousand dollars in industry funding  for the research programs.  Dr. Wample has served on a number of  committees for the departments and colleges  he has worked  in. He has served on  the  Washington State Animal Damage Control Advisory Board, the Washington Agriculture and  Forestry Leadership Selection Committee, the  W–130/WRCC–17, organizing committee  for  the  International Symposium on Nitrogen  in  Grapes and Wine, the National Grapevine Importation Program and he served as the co-  chairman of the committee for the International  Symposium on Wine Grape  Irrigation. He  is  also  involved with  the American Association  for  the Advancement of Science, American  Society of Plant Physiology, American Society  of Horticulture Science, American Society of  Enology and Viticulture and  the Northwest  Chapter of the American Society of Enology  and Viticulture. Dr. Wample’s civic and community membership  includes Rotary  International, Prosser Wine and Food Fair Committee, Advisor to the Prosser Economic Development  Association  and  United  Good  Neighbors.  Dr. Wample has been involved with, and led  numerous  research  projects,  including  research on specific physiological responses of  a plant and agricultural advancements in machinery and irrigation. He has spoken at many  seminars and given many presentations. Dr.  Wample is published in well over two hundred  journals, books, magazines, reports, abstracts,  papers and publications.  For his activities, inside the university and  the community, Dr. Wample has been widely  honored. He has been honored by the American Society of Enology and Viticulture,  the  International  Symposium  of  Nitrogen  in  Grapes and Wine,  the Second  International  Symposium  on  Climate  Viticulture,  International Conference on Crop Productivity and  the National Research Council of Canada.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend  and congratulate Dr. Robert Wample upon his  retirement  from California State University,  Fresno. I invite my colleagues to join me in  wishing Dr. Wample many years of continued  success.  f  THANKING JOE ADAMS FOR HIS  SERVICE TO THE HOUSE  HON. ROBERT A.

2083,199,2009-11-05,Mr.  BRADY  of  Pennsylvania.,"  Madam  Speaker, on the occasion of his retirement on  November 2, 2009, we rise to thank Mr. Joe  Adams for his 32 years of distinguished service to Congress. Joe has served this great institution as a valued employee of the Architect  of the Capitol for 19 years and House Information Resources  (HIR),  in  the Office of  the  Chief Administrative Officer  (CAO)  for  13  years.  Joe joined HIR in 1996 as a Data Network  Engineer. During this time, he successfully upgraded the House Campus Data Network to  an Ethernet-based, high-capacity data communications backbone and increased the House  Internet connection capacity 200 fold from 3  Megabits per second  (Mbps)  to 600 Mbps.  These upgrades were the foundation of greatly  improved information technology service delivery and contributed significantly to highly available, mission critical data transport services.  In recent years, as manager for the Network  Systems Engineering Branch, Joe led a team  of engineers who helped implement upgrades  to support efficient, effective and sustainable  services to the House. His unparalleled dedication,  considerable  institutional  knowledge  and attention to detail have helped the Office  of  the CAO maintain a high degree of customer satisfaction. For his performance, he  was awarded the ‘‘CAO Distinguished Service  Award’’  in 2003 and  the  ‘‘CAO Excellence  Award for Knowledge’’ in 2008.  On behalf of the entire House community,  we extend congratulations to Joe for his years  of dedication and outstanding contributions to  the United States Congress.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

2084,206,2009-11-05,Ms. HIRONO.," Madam Speaker,I would like  to  recognize  the  late  Anthony  T.  Kahoohanohano for his extraordinary heroism  while serving during the Korean War. Private  First Class Kahoohanohano’s service was recently acknowledged with our Nation’s highest  award of merit, the Medal of Honor.  I  am  grateful  to my  colleague Senator  AKAKA for inserting a provision in this year’s  defense  authorization  bill  that  awards  the  Medal of Honor to Mr. Kahoohanohano and to  President Obama for signing the bill into law.  Awarding  the Medal of Honor  to Anthony  Kahoohanohano has  long been overdue. A  19-year-old soldier from Wailuku on the island  of Maui, Kahoohanohano bravely sacrificed his  own life to protect fellow soldiers in the area  of Chupa-ri, Korea on September 1, 1951.  After ordering members of his machine-gun  squad  to  take up more secure positions  to  provide  cover  as  U.S.  forces  withdrew,  Kahoohanohano bravely stayed behind to fight  the enemy on his own, even fighting in hand-  to-hand combat after he ran out of ammunition. He was killed  in action, but his courageous actions inspired other American troops  to launch a counterattack against the enemy.  On  behalf  of Anthony Kahoohanohano’s  family and the State of Hawaii, and in honor  of  the  service  and  sacrifice  of  our  servicemembers and veterans, I thank my colleagues for supporting this measure.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  All of those involved in with the Salute to  Old Glory program  in Woodbridge Township  should be commended for their efforts.

On January 6, 2009, the start of the 111th  Congress,  the  national  debt  was  $10,638,425,746,293.80.  The  national  debt  has  increased  $1,340,527,976,532.10 so far this year.  According to the non-partisan Congressional  Budget Office, the forecast deficit for this year  is $1.6  trillion. That means  that so  far  this  year, we borrowed and spent $4.4 billion a  day more than we have collected, passing that  debt and its interest payments to our children  and all future Americans.  by  f  COMMENDING WOODBRIDGE TOWNSHIP’S SALUTE TO OLD GLORY  PROGRAM  HON. LEONARD LANCE  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 5, 2009  ",2009
2086,206,2009-11-05,Mr. LANCE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  address the House for one minute.  On Wednesday, November 11, Veterans’  Day, there will be a special celebration entitled  a Salute to Old Glory in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. The goal of the program is  to refurbish all American flags and flag poles  throughout the Woodbridge Township School  District.  This  is  a  huge  undertaking;  Woodbridge Township  is  the  largest municipality in New Jersey’s Seventh Congressional  District.  A Salute to Old Gory began is a vision of  Woodbridge  Board  of  Education Member  George  Yuhasz,  a  lifelong  resident  of  Woodbridge Township. With the help of community  activist  Charlie  Shaughnessey  of  Colonia, New Jersey the program to replace  and preserve American  flags  throughout  the  Township has become a huge success.  Veterans as well as civic organizations have  joined  in  this effort  in making Salute  to Old  Glory a positive initiative throughout the community.  The American Flag stands for many things  in our beloved Nation.  It also serves as a  great  inspiration  for  those who want  to become part of our great democracy.  Educational  involvement  incorporated  into  the program included student essays and artistic presentations  that allowed  for  involvement of students  throughout  the school district.  The program has been successful because  it has been a total community effort. In fact,  Salute to Old Glory will become an ongoing  effort not only  for  the Woodbridge Board of  Education  but  for  all  public  buildings  in  Woodbridge Township  that may need a  replenishment of an American flag or flagpole.  f  OPPOSING ANY ENDORSEMENT OR  FURTHER  CONSIDERATION  OF  REPORT  OF  THE  UNITED  NATIONS FACT FINDING MISSION  ON THE GAZA CONFLICT  SPEECHOF  HON. GWEN MOORE  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 3, 2009  ",2009
2087,206,2009-11-05,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that we have gotten to  the point that the House even has to consider  this resolution before us this week. I am inclined to vote for this resolution but not without  reservations.  My vote  for  this resolution should not be  read either as an endorsement of Operation  Lead Cast or as an endorsement of the position that investigations of serious allegations of  war crimes should not be undertaken.  We cannot act as if the devastating war in  Gaza in January did not have consequences  for Palestinians, Israelis, and the international  community. We cannot and should not brush  aside  legitimate  allegations  about  abuses  committed by both sides during this conflict.  Yet, now more than ever, we also need to intensify efforts  to  resolve  the  very  serious  issues  that had unfortunately  led  to many  needless deaths and continuing tensions and  may continue to do so if we let the status quo  linger.  I have reservations that the resolution before the House this week would do nothing to  defuse  the  demagoguery  that  has  long  plagued the Middle East and to help steer us  to a future devoid of more rocket attacks or violence in the region.  Ten months after  the  ‘‘cessation’’ of overt  fighting  in Gaza,  tensions  remain high and  both  the Palestinian and  Israeli people continue  to  live with  tremendous  insecurity and  fear. I am dismayed that it appears to be only  a matter of time until the endless cycle of violence repeats  itself again along with  the resumption of  increased misery  for  innocent  Israeli and Palestinian men, women, and children in the region. We as a Congress, at this  point, would be better served by trying to support efforts to reinvigorate the peace process,  defuse these mounting tensions, and pressing  both parties to meet at the negotiating table.  Nonetheless, the Goldstone report includes  some very serious charges relating to possible  war crimes or other crimes against humanity  committed by Israel, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups. To give just one example,  there are allegations of deliberate and  premeditative efforts  to  target a wastewater  treatment plant—that did not have any link to  ‘‘Palestinian armed groups or any other effective contribution  to military action’’—sending  over 200,000 cubic meters of  raw sewage  onto farmland. What is lacking in this report is  a full and complete accounting of the reckless,  indiscriminate, and ongoing use of rockets by  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:31 Nov 06, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A05NO8.024 E05NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

In addition,  this legislation enjoys the support of  the entire New Jersey House delegation.  A native of the town of Harrison,  New  Jersey, Patricia McGinty-Juhl  dedicated the majority of her life to  public service as an employee of the  United States Postal Service for over  33 years.  Ms. McGinty-Juhl began her distinguished career with the postal service  in 1973 as a distribution clerk at the  New York International and Bulk Mail  Center located in Jersey City, New Jersey. During her more than three decades of service, Ms. McGinty-Juhl also  served in a variety of personnel and  benefits positions with the Postal Service Human Resources Division, as well  as  in the Government Relations Department at postal headquarters as a  congressional liaison.  Most recently, in recognition of her  tremendous talent and admirable dedication to her coworkers, Ms. McGinty-  Juhl served as western area manager of  human resources  from April of 2001  until her unexpected passing on October 16, 2006.  In  remembrance  of Ms. McGinty-  Juhl’s life and career, United States  Postmaster General Jack Potter offered the  following tribute upon the  untimely  passing  of  this  dedicated  postal employee: ‘‘Patti will be greatly  missed, both as a manager and as a  warm and giving person. She made a  difference for the postal service and for  our employees.’’  Mr. Speaker, let us take this opportunity to honor Ms. Patricia McGinty-  Juhl for her 33 years of public service  by designating the Harrison Avenue  postal facility in Harrison, New Jersey,  in her honor.

While working in the human resources  office, she was instrumental in overseeing affirmative action issues on behalf of employees as the district women’s program coordinator. As a result  of her work, she was offered a position  at the U.S. Postal Service headquarters  in Washington as the national women’s  program manager.  Once in Washington, Ms. McGinty-  Juhl continued to impress those who  worked with her.

The Postmaster General, Jack  Potter, often spoke of Ms. McGinty-  Juhl as an outstanding manager and a  warm and giving person.  Ms. McGinty-Juhl passed away at her  home in 2006.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 3539 and recognizing  Ms. McGinty-Juhl’s dedication to the  betterment of the United States Postal  Service.

2096,4,2009-11-16,Mr. SIRES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 3539 which would designate  the U.S.  Postal Service building  located at 427 Harrison Avenue in Harrison, New Jersey as the  ‘‘Patricia D. McGinty-Juhl Post Office.’’  Born and raised  in Harrison, New Jersey,  Mrs. McGinty-Juhl had a  long and distinguished career with  the Postal Service  that  spanned over 33 years. Her professional accomplishments serving New Jersey  included  clerking at  the New York  International Bulk  Mail Center in Jersey City, a variety of Personnel and Benefits positions within Human  Resources, and the District Women’s Program  Coordinator working on affirmative action activities on behalf of all employees. Later she  became the National Women’s Program Manager at USPS National Headquarters as National Women’s Program Manager.  In recognition of her enormous  talent and  ability to work with people, Mrs. McGinty-Juhl  was offered a position  in Government Relations serving as the Government Relations Liaison  to Congressional  offices. She  later  moved over to the Human Resource Department at Postal Service Headquarters as the  Program Manager, Research and Communications, where she worked with national leaders  on postal issues.  She ended her career as Western Area  Manager of Human Resources where  she  served until her death on October 16, 2006.  Speaking on behalf of postal employees everywhere, Postmaster General  Jack Potter  gave  the  following  tribute  to Mrs. McGinty-  Juhl: ‘‘Patti will be greatly missed, both as a  manager and as a warm and giving person.  She made a difference for the Postal Service  and for our employees.’’  I am pleased to celebrate this dedicated civil  servant through this legislation. I cannot think  of a better way to honor Mrs. McGinty-Juhl’s  legacy than by designating a U.S. Postal Office in her name—a place in which she devoted her life’s work.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  ",2009

2101,11,2009-11-16,Mr. GOHMERT.," Madam Speaker, to  follow up on my friend from California,  he is exactly right. There is no good  reason for bringing the most dangerous  terrorists and terrorist organizers to  the most densely populated area in our  country.  Those  of  us  who  have  logistically been involved in setting up  trials know that every bailiff, every  guard, every person involved in the justice system will be at risk, as will their  families.  So we know that every President  brings their own kinds of experience to  the office. This President does not have  justice  experience. He  doesn’t have  military experience. He doesn’t have  foreign affairs experience. He doesn’t  have domestic affairs experience. He  voted ‘‘present’’ so often. But what he  has  is community organizing experience, and that will be invaluable in organizing the communities in New York  to get them off the island after the terrorists move in during the trial.  f  COSTS SOAR IN PELOSI’S  TAKEOVER BILL  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, the nonpartisan, independent  experts at  the Centers  for  Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS,  released their analysis of the Pelosi  takeover. I would like to say it was  shocking, but I already had my suspicions that the government takeover  of health care was going to cost much  more than claimed. The  independent  report this weekend exposes the truth  and the real cost.  The  report  shows  that  the Pelosi  takeover will  increase  health  care  costs by $289 billion. This discredits all  the assertions we have heard about  how a 2,000-page bill, the $1.3 trillion  health care bill, will somehow lower  costs. This health care takeover will  violate this administration’s promise  to ‘‘bend the cost curve.’’ It will add  more than a dime to the deficit and  kill jobs.  There are better alternatives that  Congress  should  consider,  like H.R.  3400, that will lower health care costs  for families and small businesses while  creating jobs.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.

2104,11,2009-11-16,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam  Speaker,  Matthew Hoh, a  former Marine captain, recently resigned his job as U.S.  Government reconstruction official in  Afghanistan. In his letter of resignation, he criticized the American strategy in Afghanistan. He said the presence of large numbers of U.S. troops is  making  the  insurgency  stronger because it makes the Afghan people see  America as an occupying power, a  power that must be opposed.  Now, before anybody accuses Captain  Hoh  of  being  a  long-haired  hippie  peacenik, keep in mind that he fought  with distinction in Iraq before serving  in Afghanistan. He  believes  in  the  American military. He supports it with  all his heart.  b1930  In fact, he says that ‘‘no nation has  ever known a more dedicated military  as the U.S. Armed Forces. The performance of our troops,’’ he says, ‘‘is  unmatched.’’  But he also, Madam Speaker, believes that no military force has ever  been given such a complex mission as  the U.S. military has received in Afghanistan.  Captain Hoh is right. Our troops have  been given an impossible job, and now  we are seeing the tragic results. Over  1,000  American  troops  have  been  wounded in battle in just the past 3  months. That accounts for one-fourth  of all the casualties we’ve taken since  the war began in October 2001.  Think about it. The war has been  going on for 97 months in Afghanistan,  and one-fourth of all the casualties  have been suffered in just the last 3  months.  Things have gotten so bad, Madam  Speaker, in fact, that the casualty rate  in Afghanistan is now actually higher  than the casualty rate for American  troops at the height of the violence in  Iraq. And the spike in the casualty rate  occurred after the administration sent  21,000 more troops to Afghanistan in  the hope that there is a military solution to the problem.  But relying on military power alone  has not done the job, and escalating  the war now by sending in tens of thousands more  troops won’t  solve  the  problem either.  That’s why I am calling on President  Obama to change our mission in Afghanistan. I have urged him to devote  most of our efforts on humanitarian  aid, diplomacy, and economic development.  These  are  the  elements  of  ‘‘SMART Security.’’ They’ll do a much  better  job of stabilizing Afghanistan  than a heavy military footprint.  Without this change in strategy, our  troops are likely to face worse, not better, situations. The enemy is learning  how to use IEDs more efficiently. Lieutenant Thomas Metz, the director of  the Pentagon’s effort to reduce IED  casualties,  has  acknowledged  that  sending more  troops  to Afghanistan  will likely mean more IED deaths and  injuries, which  include  spinal  cord  damage, traumatic brain injuries, and  amputations.  So I urge the administration to move  in a new and a different direction for  the sake of our country and for the  sake of America’s troops and their families. And I urge every Member of the  House to listen to the words of Matthew Hoh, who wrote the following to a  State Department official:  ‘‘I  trust you understand  the  sacrifices made by so many thousands of  military families whose homes bear the  fractures, upheavals, and scars of multiple deployments. Thousands of our  men and women have returned home  with wounds,  some  that will never  heal. The dead return only in bodily  form to be received by families who  must be assured that their dead have  sacrificed for a purpose worthy of futures lost.’’  Madam Speaker, the casualty rate in  Afghanistan  is  unacceptable.  Continuing the same policies that put our  brave troops at risk  is unthinkable.  That’s why it’s time to put SMART Security to work in a place where military power alone just isn’t the answer.  f  THE TRIAL OF KHALID SHEIKH  MOHAMMED  ",2009

2108,18,2009-11-16,Mr. MCCAUL.," Madam Speaker, tonight we rise during this  leadership  hour to remember the events of November 5, 2009, one of the largest attacks that was perpetrated at our U.S.  military  installation at Fort Hood,  Texas, just north of my district, a very  solemn occasion. Thirteen people were  killed, over 30 people wounded, and an  unborn child was killed that day. I  went to the memorial service, thirteen  pairs of combat boots put  together  with a rifle and a helmet on top, and  the pictures of the victims who were  killed in cold blood that day by a deranged  gunman who, unfortunately,  served in the United States military.  In my view, simply put, it was an act  of treason. Look, in a time of war, soldiers are killed. But when I visited  Fort Hood for the memorial service,  they  said,  Congressman, we  never  dreamed that they would be killed in  our home. This is our home. This man  killed his fellow comrades at our home.  Very disturbing. And the words that he  said as he pointblank shot them one by  one, as 100 rounds went off from his  semi-automatic pistol, 100 rounds into  a crowd of defenseless soldiers and a  few civilians, were ‘‘Allahu Akbar, God  is great.’’ That’s one of the most disturbing reports that we got from that  tragic day.  Well, I submit that that is not our  God. That’s not the God of our Founding Fathers. As the President said so  eloquently at the memorial service, no  religion condones the killing of innocent people. No religion condones that  kind of violence. And he went on to say  that he will face his punishment here  on Earth and in the next world. The  President is right.  We went to Veterans Day services  the following day and went all across  our districts paying  tribute  to  the  great veterans, the men and women  who have  served  this country with  honor and distinction, to thank them  for their service; but the whole day,  one could not help but to stop and  think about what had just occurred at  Fort Hood, these tragic, tragic events.  Mr. Hasan will pay  for  this  tragic  event. He will be brought to justice.  And it is my sincere hope, as the President said, that he will be taken to the  next world.  And I want to, at the beginning, pay  tribute to the 13, the 13 who were killed  in cold blood that day, who died while  serving their country admirably and  nobly: Private Francheska Velez, 21, of  Chicago,  Illinois; Lieutenant Colonel  Juanita Warman, 55, from Maryland;  Major  Libardo  Caraveo,  52,  of  Woodbridge, Virginia; Captain  John  Gaffney of San Diego, California; Captain Russell Seager, 41, of Racine, Wisconsin; Staff Sergeant Justin DeCrow,  32,  of Plymouth,  Indiana; Sergeant  Amy Krueger, 29, of Kiel, Wisconsin;  Specialist Jason Hunt, 22, of Tillman  Oklahoma;  Specialist  Frederick  Greene,  29, of Mountain City, Tennessee;  Private  1st  Class  Aaron  Nemelka, 19, of West Jordan, Utah; Private 1st Class, Michael Pearson, 22, of  Bolingbroke, Illinois; Specialist Kham  Xiong, of Saint Paul, Minnesota, just  23 years old; and, finally, Mr. Michael  Cahill, 62, of Cameron, Texas, where he  was a civilian employee.  Fort Hood has a special connotation  for many of us in Texas. It’s the largest  military installation in the world. The  fact that it was attacked, the fact that  these soldiers were killed at home, in  my view, is the greatest act of treason  and the greatest tragedy of November  5.  But  there were heroes  that  day.  There were many heroes that day. Sergeant Kim Munley, the civilian cop  employed by the base, described by fellow officers as a tough cookie, pretty  much fearless, born and bred to be a  police officer, and a very good shot.  She was nicknamed  ‘‘Mighty Mouse’’  because of her size long before the Fort  Hood  shooting. Three minutes after  Mr. Hasan  began  shooting, Munley  tracked  him  down  outside  of  the  predeployment  facility and unloaded  on him at close range. Munley was hit  in both legs and a wrist during the gun  battle, but stayed on her feet bravely  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:37 Jan 30, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\H16NO9.REC H16NO9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009
2109,25,2009-11-16,Mr. GOHMERT.," And the gentleman  makes a great point also, that he is not  remorseful at all and, in fact, here he  has been in prison, and this is filed this  year, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  says, and this is from his pleading that  he himself prepared, so our religion is a  religion of fear and terror to the enemies of God, the Jews, the Christians  and pagans. With God willing, we are  terrorists to the bone. So many thanks  to God. He went on to say, and he  quotes the Arab poet that stated, we  will terrorize you as long as we live,  with swords, fire and airplanes.  It’s  unbelievable  that  you would  bring a guy like this into the United  States of America, put our soldiers at  risk for the future, forcing them to try  to gather forensic evidence. While people are shooting at them they’re going  to have to be worried about  fingerprints and DNA evidence and gee, did  they have witnesses, getting witnesses’  names and addresses, locations so they  can come back and perhaps bring them  to court in New York some day to testify. We just don’t do this. We can’t afford to do this when people are at war.  Our President,  this administration  may not realize we’re at war, but there  are people at war with us, and we fail  to respond at our own risk. This is  scary stuff. And we have the Military  Commission Act of 2006. We’re working  on language that will make it a requirement so that it is not an option  for the President. I mentioned article  1, section 8 that gives power to Congress to constitute tribunals inferior to  the Supreme Court. As a constitutional  law professor mentioned this weekend  to me as I was visiting with him about  this issue. He said, you know, the Supreme Court is really the only court in  the country that has a right to exist  under the Constitution. Every other  court, tribunal, commission, only has  their existence at the will of Congress.  And article 3 and section 1 makes  that clear: The judicial power of the  United States shall be vested in one  Supreme Court and  in such  inferior  courts as the Congress may from time  to time ordain and establish. Going  over, and it says, even the Supreme  Court, it talks about all cases affecting  ambassadors,  other  public ministers  and consuls and those  in which the  State  shall  be  party,  the Supreme  Court shall have original jurisdiction.  In the other cases before mentioned the  Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law, in fact, with  such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.  We have an obligation in this Congress to rein in a President that is putting New York City, our soldiers, our  military at risk, and we fail to do so at  the risk of those we are elected to  serve and protect from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I yield to my friend  from Arizona.  ",2009
2110,25,2009-11-16,Mr. SHADEGG., I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I think it’s important to note that from the outset there  have been some in this body who have  tried to stop this moment from occurring. I introduced legislation as soon as  I heard that the President intended to  bring detainees from Guantanamo Bay  to the United States and to close Guantanamo Bay. I introduced legislation  back  last February  to prohibit  the  President from bringing a single person  who had ever been detained at Guantanamo Bay here to the United States.  Mine was one of many bills introduced  by Republican Members of Congress to  try to stop this very point.  ,2009
2111,25,2009-11-16,Mr. GOHMERT.,"  If  the  gentleman  would yield, that was a good bill he  filed as well, and I appreciate the efforts in doing that.  ",2009
2112,25,2009-11-16,Mr. SHADEGG.," Our minority leader,  Mr. BOEHNER, introduced a bill identical or very similar to mine. There  have been other pieces of legislation. I  just want to make it clear that I think  that this is a grave error on so many  fronts  it’s hard to explain. And  it’s  worth maybe trying to lay out some of  those points for anybody who’d just listen. Number one,  I  think  the gentleman made a good point of this earlier.  If you bring  terrorists  to  the  United States, there is, first and foremost, the danger that by merely being  physically  present  in  the  United  States, they will acquire rights that  they do not have in Guantanamo Bay,  that they do not have in Iraq, or that  they did not have in Afghanistan.  ",2009
2113,25,2009-11-16,Mr. GOHMERT.," And I will add that  no prisoner of war, no enemy combatant has ever had in the whole history  of the world and of mankind.  ",2009
2114,25,2009-11-16,Mr. SHADEGG.," And why  are we  changing it? For some sense of political correctness, because we doubt ourselves, because we doubt that we were  attacked, because we doubt the sincerity of the insane comments you’ve  just read from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed about his  intention to kill us,  about his bragging, I believe, of beheading Daniel Pearl himself?  Those are shocking things. But that’s  just like the first of many reasons why  this is a terrible policy. The gentleman  did, I think, an excellent job earlier,  that maybe  the  average American  doesn’t think about. But think of the  risk that you are imposing upon not  just the sworn police officers who will  transport  the  combatants  brought  here, and the jailers that will jail them  and the judges that will preside and the  clerks that will be in the room or the  bailiffs, but think of every single one of  their family members, not just their  children, their wives; what about their  brothers, their sisters, their cousins,  their aunts, all of whom now become  targets of terrorism, because if I were a  terrorist outside of United States and  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was going  on trial  in New York, I’d say, why  don’t I find the judge’s cousin? Why  don’t I find the bailiff’s sister? Why  don’t I find the jailer’s brother? And  I’ll capture them and hold them for  ransom until Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is released.  We are placing literally, a countless  number of Americans, guards, bailiffs,  clerks, judges, jury members, and all  their  families at  risk  to afford  to  avowed terrorists who say the insane  hatred things that you just read? We  are putting all of them at risk to afford  to  Khalid  Sheikh Mohammed  the  rights that our Constitution reserves  to Americans accused of, Americans  simply accused of  criminal acts  in  America? These were not criminal acts  in America. This was an act of war.  b2145  As our colleague from Texas pointed  out earlier, he made no mistake. When  Osama bin Laden declared war against  the United States, it was not, ‘‘I plan  to go rob the United States.’’ It was  not, ‘‘I plan to go kidnap Americans in  the United States and hold them for  ransom.’’ It was, ‘‘I am declaring war  against the United States.’’ And here  we sit compliant in this process because we want to be politically correct;  we want to be perceived as fair.  What did we establish that was unfair about Guantanamo? Soldiers there  have been given copies of the Koran.  They’ve been given prayer mats. They  are allowed time of prayer. We have  spent $50 million or more in building  and improving that facility.  This is the first time in the course of  the history of this Nation that we have  doubted ourselves so much as to say we  can’t deal with enemy combatants who  launch a war against us as we have  dealt with them throughout history;  throughout World War I, World War II,  Korea, Vietnam. The  tradition,  the  standards, the equity, the justice of the  American military tribunal process has  been established. And now, for the sake  of political correctness, because somebody is unhappy, maybe somebody who  is not a friend of the United States,  maybe somebody who is not an ally of  the United States, maybe somebody  who wants to destroy this Nation, says,  ‘‘We don’t like your system,’’ so we are  going to put them into the American  criminal justice system? It makes no  sense.  If he had been born here, if he had  been a domestic  terrorist who had  begun his activities here, maybe that  could be debated, but that is not the  case. Not born here, not a U.S. citizen,  not here when the crimes were committed, plotted from overseas as an act  of war under the command of Osama  bin Laden—a man who had already declared war on the United States—and  both of them part of an entity, al  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:37 Jan 30, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\H16NO9.REC H16NO9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

2125,46,2009-11-16,Mr. BROWN., Sure.  ,2009
2126,46,2009-11-16,Mr. DURBIN.," I tell the Senator, I was  back home in Illinois during the break  and went to southern Illinois, which is  an area the Senator would be familiar  with in a second. It is a small town,  rural area. I love it. That is where my  roots are in our State. I stopped at a  hotel in the area of Marion, IL, and  there is a nice lady who fixes breakfast  in the morning  for the guests. Her  name is Judy. She could not be any  kinder and nicer and always has a  warm greeting.  She came up to me, as she was getting a cup of coffee, and said: Is this  health care thing going to help me?  I said: Do you have health insurance?  She  said: Oh, no.  I’ve never had  health insurance.  Judy, I am guessing, is about 60 years  old.  I said: Well, I can tell you, if you just  give me an idea about yourself, I will  give you kind of an idea of what you  might expect.  She said: Well, they keep cutting our  hours at the hotel here. I am down to  30 hours a week, and I get paid about $8  an hour.  So I said: Well, I’ll do a quick calculation.  I  think you make  about  $12,000 a year.  She said: Yeah.  Imagine,  living on  $12,000 a year,  which is what her gross income is.  I said: By most of the bills that are  going  through Congress now, unless  you are making over $14,000 or $15,000 a  year, you will be covered by Medicaid,  which means you are going to have  health insurance for the first time in  your life through Medicaid.  She said: I don’t have to pay for it?  I said: No. You’re in a low-income  situation. You wouldn’t have to pay for  it at $12,000 a year.  I say to the Senator, I thought, as  the Senator was just speaking, what if  she were making $15,000 a year and her  employer did not offer health  insurance? As I understand it, at that point,  most of the bills say: It is time for you  to find a way to find health insurance.  And the insurance exchange will give  you  some  options  from which  to  choose.  What the Senator is saying—what I  believe, and I think what the vast majority of our people believe—is, one of  those options should be a not-for-profit  plan, the lowest cost for Judy to buy  into. As the Presiding Officer pointed  out in an earlier meeting we had, if we  were to say we are going to impose an  obligation on people to buy health insurance but only give them private  health insurance options, I think most  people would say: Wait a minute. If you  are going to impose an obligation on  me to buy health insurance, give me  some affordable options.  Our support for a public option is to  come up with a not-for-profit plan that  is not trying to please shareholders,  that is not advertising on radio and  television, and that does not hire lots  of people, clerks to say no. That, to  me, is a sensible outcome for the obligation to buy health insurance because  it gives people choices.  I salute Senator HARRYREIDbecause,  as  our Democratic  leader,  he  said  maybe there are some Governors, some  States, some people who just do not  want a public option. Let them decide  to opt out of the system. They can opt  out. They are not going to be forced in.  They can opt out. I think that is a reasonable way to move.  So I say to the Senator from Ohio,  you probably have a lot of your constituents,  just  like mine—like Judy  who works down at this hotel—who are  uninsured at the moment. She has diabetes,  incidentally. She told me she  had some medical issues and could not  even go to a doctor, see a doctor, because she just does not make enough  money. That is the reality of life for a  lot of hard-working people in Illinois,  and in Ohio, I am sure.  ",2009

2129,53,2009-11-16,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President, I wish to  remember the life of an extraordinary  resident from my home State of Alaska, Juanita Lou Helms. Ms. Helms  passed away on November 7, 2009, in her  hometown of Fairbanks. She was 68.  Ms. Helms was active in local community  organizations,  politics,  and  most importantly, was devoted to her  husband,  their  four  children,  and  grandchildren.  Juanita began her public service on  the borough assembly in 1980, but she is  most well known in the community for  becoming  the Fairbanks North Star  Borough’s first female mayor in 1985.  During her two terms, Mayor Helms  sheparded  the Borough  through difficult  financial  times. As an  ‘‘open  door’’ mayor and terrific listener, she  inspired the trust needed to find common ground among her constituents.  Among her accomplishments was the  construction of the community’s convention center, improving air quality,  and helping thaw the ‘‘ice curtain’’ by  establishing a sister city relationship  with Yakutsk in Eastern Russia.  Away from the political realm, Ms.  Helms was  involved  in  innumerable  civic  endeavors,  especially  parent-  teacher groups in Fairbanks. She also  held an assortment of jobs in the community from carhop to court clerk to  rental property manager.  In her personal life Juanita was an  avid dancer who was loved by her family and all who knew her. She and her  husband Sam were devoted to their  children  Fawn,  Selene,  Ren,  and  Karisse. They were so deeply involved  in their lives and those of their many  grandchildren  that  the  number  of  events they attended and participated  in are virtually countless.  Juanita will be missed by her family,  friends,  and  all  of  the  people  she  touched in the State of Alaska.∑  f  REMEMBERING ANNIE  ASHENFELTER  ∑",2009
2130,53,2009-11-16,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President, I rise  today  in  remembrance  of  Annie  ‘‘Akkuluq’’ Ashenfelter. I am saddened  to announce with her passing on October 8, 2009, the village of White Mountain and the great State of Alaska lost  an elder of great cultural knowledge,  wisdom, and language. The magnitude  of this loss is better understood by recalling the immense contributions she  gave her family, community, and region.  Annie was born in White Mountain  on January 24, 1913. She spoke Inupiat  as  her  first  language  and  learned  English when she went to school. She  completed the third grade.  Annie lived a subsistence life, reliant  on the land and its resources to sustain  her family. Annie’s steadfast connection to her Inupiat  identity ensured  her children, grandchildren and her  many generations to follow would remain grounded in those same cultural  roots and values. Annie  loved to go  camping and  fishing,  living off  the  land, spending 90 years of her life sharing this love with her family. She enjoyed preparing Native food and sharing what she had with others. Annie  was a talented sewer, of both children’s  clothing and animal skins. She made  all 10 of her children’s clothing: pants,  shirts, parkies, mukluks, and mittens.  Annie was a pillar of her community.  She had  strength of character, embodied knowledge of the land, and symbolized the resilience of the Inupiat  people. Her kind heart has left a permanent mark on the lives of countless  individuals. Annie was easy to laugh,  had good memories, and enjoyed the  simple things in life: getting up in the  morning, having her morning cup of  coffee, sitting at the window and observing life in White Mountain. Annie  never had a bad word to say about anyone, ever. Even during the difficult  times, she lived her life with grace,  humor, love, strength, joy and understanding. Annie was a  strong Fish  River Inupiaq woman.  Mr. President and colleagues, please  join me in honor and remembrance of  Annie  ‘‘Akkuluq’’ Ashenfelter, whose  love and wisdom will forever be in the  memories of those who loved and knew  her.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO EDEN SUTLEY  ∑",2009
2131,53,2009-11-16,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  I  come to the floor today to honor a very  special Louisianian, Eden Sutley, who  has served her State and Nation with  great distinction. Eden is a Lafayette,  LA, native who is currently a junior at  the George Washington University in  Washington, DC. Just like Louisiana’s  senior Senator, Eden Sutley is a proud  member of the Delta Gamma Fraternity.  Winston Churchill, one of the great  figures of World War II, once said: ‘‘We  make a living by what we do, but we  make a life by what we give.’’  Eden Sutley may not know what she  wants to do to earn a living after college, but her volunteer spirit and desire  to give back to the ‘‘greatest generation’’ precisely highlights the sentiment to which Mr. Churchill refers.  At the urging of her father, 2 years  ago Eden became involved with Louisiana HonorAir Program. This group,  based in Eden’s hometown of Lafayette, honors surviving World War II  veterans by giving  them an opportunity to see the Washington, DC, memorials  dedicated  to  their  service.  After  flying up  from Louisiana, the  veterans visit the World War II, Korea,  Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials and  travel to Arlington National Cemetery.  Eden Sutley has played an important  role during HonorAir’s trips to Washington, DC. For each visit, Eden organizes about 40 of her sorority sisters to  come out and assist these World War II  heroes. They help by pushing wheelchairs, taking pictures, and handing  out water as these Louisiana World  War II veterans experience the Nation’s  Capital, many for the first time.  In all, Eden has recruited over 200 sorority sisters to lend a hand to our  HonorAir veterans. They have volunteered on more than a dozen Saturdays  since 2007, helping over 1,000 veterans.  There have been seven different flights  this year alone, including the last trip  of the year, which occurred October 24.  Volunteering with HonorAir to assist  the World War II veterans is so popular  among her fellow Delta Gammas that  some sisters come back to help out  even after they have graduated. Eden  has also inspired two other Louisianians, Terricia Soyombo and Brooke  Oschner, who are also Delta Gammas  at George Washington University, to  become part of this effort. Through her  role  as Delta Gamma  president  at  George Washington, Eden has been instrumental in getting other Greek organizations involved, as well.  Eden has demonstrated a passion for  public service that serves as a model  for college students across our great  country.  On  behalf  of  Louisiana  HonorAir and our entire State, I thank  Eden for her leadership, for her willingness to give back, and  for  inspiring  others to do the same.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII  VETERANS  ∑",2009

Angela D’Aurio is also a supporter of the area  Kiwanis Denver West Soccer Club.

For 75 years they have  stood firmly to their commitment to our Nation.  One of the ways we honor our country is to  make service a tradition. In south Jersey, this  effort has gained substantial support from the  VFW, a visible, active, and honorable organization. I often cite the way in which our veterans  find ways  to continue  to serve as a  strength to our community. Veterans in south  Jersey have been a constant reminder of the  pride we take in public service throughout the  past 75 years.  VFW Post 3020 has always been supportive  of service men and women at any  time of  need. The members of VFW Post 3020 all  served this country once. Now they are serving their country again. And I for one would  like to thank them for all they have done, and  will continue to do.  Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing  the best  for  the  long  future ahead  for  this  great organization. Thank you to all of the veterans of VFW Post 3020, and thanks to all of  the members of our community who support  the VFW in their mission. God bless you all,  and God bless America.  f  HONORING LARRY SHEHADEY  HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  and DEVINNUNES Monday, November 16, 2009  ",2009

Mr. Shehadey passed  away on Saturday, October 10, 2009 at the  age of one hundred and two. The life of Mr.  Shehadey will be honored on Thursday, October 15, 2009 in Fresno, California.  Larry Shehadey was born on July 2, 1907 to  Lebanese  immigrants Salem and Sadie. He  was raised  in  the  foothills of Northern California. He never missed a day of school, although he did walk or ride his horse five miles  one-way to get to school. His family moved to  San Francisco, where he graduated from Polytechnic High and excelled in athletics. Upon  graduating  from high school, he became a  salesman  in  San  Francisco  and married  Elayne.  In 1951, Mr. Shehadey bought a controlling  interest  in Producer’s Dairy and moved his  family to Fresno, California. When he became  involved with Producer’s,  the company was  one of over seventy dairies  in  the Fresno  area;  however,  through  creative marketing  Producer’s became the top dairy in just three  years. He was innovative and always looking  for a better way to do things. He developed  his own vertical  integration system  to make  production more efficient. He also started his  own herd and added acreage to grow alfalfa  to feed his herd. His two sons, John and Richard, became part of the family business.  Growing up during the depression, his goal  was always to provide well for his family and  to leave a legacy for them. He was also very  involved in our community. Mr. Shehadey was  generous  in giving and donated  to Fresno  hospitals, Fresno City College and possibly his  largest contribution was  to California State  University, Fresno. He donated to CSU Fresno  through his support of  the Craig School of  Business,  the Jordan College of Agricultural  Science and Technology and the athletics department. He was honored by CSU Fresno  when they named a clock tower after him.  After sixty-three years of marriage, Mrs.  Shehadey passed away. Mr. Shehadey is survived by his two sons, John and his wife Mary,  and Richard and his wife Sue; eight grandchildren, eighteen great grandchildren and two  nephews.  Madam Speaker, we  rise  today  to posthumously honor Larry Shehadey. I invite my  colleagues to join me in honoring his life and  wishing the best for his family.  f  HONORING BRENDA D.

2135,67,2009-11-16,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  to  honor Brenda D. Williams for her many years  of service and dedication to the U.S. Postal  Service. On October 31, 2009, after 36 years,  Brenda retired from her position as Customer  Relations/Congressional Liaison  for  the Chicago District.  Ms. Williams began her career working  in  the old Chicago Main Post Office Building as  a Tour 1 Scheme Qualified/Distribution Clerk.  Her hard work and dedication earned her a  position in the Regional Office and secretary  to the Manager.  After  five short years, Ms. Williams was  transferred to the Computer Forwarding Site to  help train all new clerks. Due to her experience and knowledge of  the postal system,  Brenda soon became a valuable asset to all  CFS Managers. Her  institutional knowledge  helped ease the transitions of six managers,  ensuring that operations never missed a beat.  In 1995, Brenda moved to the Consumer Affairs Department, where she stayed until 2001,  when she was  transferred  to  the Congressional Office.  Brenda always went above and beyond to  provide assistance to those who were unable  to access alternate means of assistance, both  in the public sector and as a congressional liaison. She calmly dealt with many difficult circumstances.  Ms. Williams has helped the Postal System  in other ways, as well. She has served on numerous  committees,  including: Multicultural  Day, Federal Employee of  the Year, Postmaster  Installations, Stamp Unveilings, Congressional Briefings, Santa Letters and Employee Recognition Day. In all areas, Brenda’s  expertise proved invaluable.

2136,74,2009-11-16,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to commend and congratulate Break the  Barriers upon celebrating its 25th anniversary.  The organization’s anniversary will be celebrated on Wednesday, October 21, 2009, in  Fresno, CA.  Ken and Carnie Mullen, Ice Capades performers, had two daughters, Deby and Kathy.  Deby was a phenomenal athlete, and at the  age of  ten began  taking gymnastics at  the  Fresno Gymnastics Club. By  the  time Deby  was sixteen, she had become a regional, state  and national gymnastics champion. Kathy also  excelled  in gymnastics. Although  she was  born with Down Syndrome, she was able to  emulate Deby and competed  in  the Special  Olympics. Deby was beginning to look toward  international competition when her gymnastics  dreams were cut short by a devastating ankle  injury. The injury did not stop her love for the  sport. Inspired by her sister Kathy, Deby recognized her calling and began to coach adults  who had different physical, neurological and  mental abilities.  Deby married Steve Hergenrader, a former  New York Yankees baseball player. The couple worked on Steve’s grandfather’s 20-acre  grape vineyard and started a club called, The  Tri-City Olympiads. Eventually,  they created  the Fresno District Special Olympics Gymnastics Program.  Deby and Steve moved away from the family vineyard and found a house that was large  enough to house a dance studio inside and  gymnastics equipment  in  the back yard,  including old bed mattresses, a trampoline, balance beam, and a vaulting horse with a spring  board. This new enterprise was Gymnastics  by Deby.  After many years of working with people  with various abilities, Deby began to recognize  that  the barriers  that separate one person’s  ability from another is the lack of opportunity  to do anything in common together. Through  Deby and Steve’s integrated sports and performing arts classes, the students found common ground. The students began  learning  from one another and all of the students were  successful. Without any advertising, the combined classes grew  to  include 200 children  from the age of 3 through adult. A survey conducted of local dance studios, gyms, self-defense classes and baton twirling studios determined that there were no successful programs  that  integrated students of various abilities.  With this knowledge, student’s parents helped  to  form a board of directors and Break  the  Barriers was created. The organization was officially incorporated as a nonprofit in October  1985, with the mission to ‘‘Break all barriers  experienced by people with different abilities.’’  In 1987  the performing group,  the Barrier  Breakers, was established. The  team  is a  combination of performers, each with amazing  abilities, and range  in age  from 6  to adult.  There are currently 58 performers on the team  and they perform around the world. There are  over 3,000 students that participate in the programs including aquatics, dance, gymnastics,  martial arts and sign language. Break the Barriers also provides a buddy program, day  camps and health and  fitness classes. The  programs are made up of students from eight  different school districts.  Today at Break  the Barriers Steve and  Deby, along with  their children Jared and  Tyler, continue to be dedicated to their original  purpose;  to break down barriers  through a  common purpose.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend  and congratulate Break  the Barriers on 25  years of breaking all barriers and allowing  people with different abilities  to perform  together.  I  invite my colleagues  to  join me  in  wishing Break the Barriers many years of continued success.  RECOGNIZING THE KOREAN  AMERICAN COMMUNITY SERVICES  HON.

DeCrow, a native son of Plymouth,  Indiana,  and a proud member of  the United States  Army. The servicemen and women of  the  United States Armed Forces serve with a selfless willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice  for the country they love and protect. A career  soldier with 13 years of honorable and dedicated service, Justin’s  life was  tragically cut  short in a senseless act of violence when a  gunman opened  fire at a Soldier Readiness  Processing facility at Fort Hood in Texas on  the 5th of November.  Justin always wanted  to be a soldier. He  graduated  from Plymouth High School  in  1996, married his high school sweetheart that  spring, and enlisted in the United States Army  immediately  thereafter. He pursued a career  as a soldier in the Army out of an unfailing  love of country and a desire to make a better  life for his family.  In the early part of his 13 year career as a  soldier, he performed  light vehicle maintenance. In 2000, Justin and his family moved to  Evans, Georgia, after he was assigned  to  nearby Fort Gordon, where he underwent  training as a communications satellite operator. He was stationed  in  that capacity  in  South Korea from September 2008 to August  of this year. In September, he was stationed  with the 16th Signal Company at Fort Hood,  Texas. He had hoped to return eventually to  Fort Gordon, when an opening became available, to be with his wife and daughter.  At Fort Hood, Justin was involved in training  new soldiers. He will be remembered by his  fellow soldiers in the United States Army as a  mentor with an undeniable charm and quick  wit, and by friends and family as a loving and  devoted father and husband. He is survived by  his wife of 14 years, Marikay, their 13-year old  daughter, Kylah, and two proud parents: Daniel DeCrow and Rhonda Thompson. He will be  missed by all.  It is my solemn duty, and humble privilege,  to honor the life, service, and memory of Staff  Sergeant Justin M. DeCrow, which stand as a  testament to the great honor possessed, and  sacrifices made, by our men and women  in  the armed forces and their families.

2140,81,2009-11-16,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, it  is a privilege for me to rise today to extend  congratulations to the Marty Majors family for  being selected the 2009 Holmes County, Florida Farm Family of the Year. The Majors family is an integral part of the Northwest Florida  community, and  I am proud  to honor  their  achievements.  Marty and Tiffany Majors married in 1992.  They have been farming full-time since 1996,  but  the  land on which  they  farm has been  owned by  the Majors  family  for over 100  years. Their son, Blake Majors, is a 7th grader  at Bethlehem High School and a member of  the Future Farmers of America. Together, the  family grows soybeans, peanuts, corn, oats,  and wheat. By using strip till farming practices,  the Majors are one of the area’s best soil conservationists. The family also manages a significant acreage of timberland and does custom grain harvesting as part of their agricultural enterprise.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Majors family’s tireless work  and dedication to family, faith and trade. They  are an outstanding example of the farm families that make up the backbone of our nation.  My wife Vicki and I wish Marty, Tiffany, and  Blake best wishes for continued success.

2143,2,2009-12-01,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  part of a nationwide effort to pass the  right kind of health care reform, a constituent from Austin, Greg Holloway,  has written an open letter to Congress.  He represents the organization Common Sense Texans:  ‘‘My name is Greg Holloway. I speak  not only for myself and my family but  also for over a hundred thousand other  Texans with whom I collaborate and  who I know share my views.  ‘‘You tell us that you are concerned  about health care  for our disadvantaged citizens. We are too. We wrote a  plan, published by the Austin American-Statesman,  that  would  immediately allow up to $100 billion annually  to be  sent directly  to private  health care and health insurance for  the needy without a raise in taxes. You  ignore any of our alternatives and instead raise taxes, increase costs, and  draft a bill that excludes millions and  provides no meaningful health  care  benefits until 2013.  ‘‘Stop this bill and give us health  care reform that will help, not hurt,  our country and its citizens.’’  f  JOBS  (Mrs.  KIRKPATRICK  of  Arizona  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

2144,2,2009-12-01,Mrs. KIRKPATRICK of Arizona.," Mr.  Speaker, the holiday season should be  a joyous time for all as we celebrate  with our  loved ones and count our  blessings.  Unfortunately, many  families have  been hit hard by the downturn and are  feeling the pinch during this special  time. Far too many people in my district are out of work and even more are  making due with less. It will be a challenge for them to make sure their children have a memorable holiday. I am  confident they will make do and remind their families what’s really important: faith, family, and health.  But this should remind us how important it is for Congress to help create  jobs. Partisan bickering cannot stand  in the way of creating jobs and helping  these families.  There is much we can do to create  new  opportunities  in  Arizona  and  across the country, and we can’t just  wish for things to get better. We must  actively work to make things better,  and that must be our top priority.  f  30TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  MICHELIN’S LEXINGTON COUNTY  PLANT  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, 30 years ago on November 28,  1979,  I was honored  to help break  ground on the Michelin Tire Corporation plant in Lexington, South Carolina, recruited by Governor Jim Edwards.  Michelin, the French tire manufacturer, has annual sales of $7.25 billion,  and they employ close to 18,000 American workers. Over 7,000 of those jobs  are in my home State.  For over 30 years, Michelin plants  have  been  successful  due  to  hardworking South Carolinians, and today  they specialize in world-class car and  Earth-mover tires. In addition to providing  jobs, Michelin  is an  involved  corporate citizen.  Another extraordinary achievement,  yesterday we broke ground on  the  Ameresco  biomass  cogeneration  project at the Savannah River site.  CEO George Sakellaris has pioneered  the development of alternative energy  projects.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  THE ESCALATION IN  AFGHANISTAN  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

2145,2,2009-12-01,Mr. KUCINICH.," Today our President  will announce an escalation in Afghanistan: as many as  35,000 additional  troops, costing an additional $35 billion  to prop up a government which most  acknowledge is indefensibly corrupt.  We need to redefine our national security. Our national security will not  be  found  in occupations which  fuel  insurgencies. Our  national  security  will not be found through paying off  contestants  in Afghanistan who are  with us one day and who shoot at our  soldiers the next.  We can secure our borders without  expanding them across the world. And  we can redefine our national security  by making sure that every able-bodied  person in America has a job, by helping  people save their homes and protect  their  savings and  their  investments  and their retirement security.  We need new thinking and a new  course of action, not further into Afghanistan but out. Not further away  from the concerns of the American people, but focusing on what’s important  here at home.  f  CONGRESS MUST REPEAL THE  DEATH TAX  (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2009
2146,2,2009-12-01,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker, the estate tax, also known as the  death tax, has been a drag on America’s family-owned small businesses for  decades.  It  threatens  our Nation’s  farms and ranches, the very businesses  which produce 86 percent of U.S. agricultural products.  Farmers and ranchers work their entire lives to build their land and equipment for their operations; yet the existence of the death tax could take it  all away.  The  death  tax  impedes  economic  growth because it lowers incentives for  small family businesses to invest capital in their own economic endeavors.  In other words, it punishes success.  This flies in the face of the very principles upon which our country was  founded.  The estate tax is inappropriate, and  it needs to be eliminated once and for  all. Doing so in the right way would  lift a tremendous weight off the shoulders of America’s family-owned small  businesses, farms, and ranches.  f  CELEBRATING THE  100TH BIRTHDAY OF THE TOWN OF WAKE  FOREST, NORTH CAROLINA  (Mr. MILLER  of North  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 100th  birthday of Wake Forest, North Carolina.  The State legislature officially chartered the town on February 20, 1909;  but the community really dates from  1832 when Dr. Calvin Jones sold 613  acres of  land to the North Carolina  Baptist Convention  to establish  the  Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute to  train future ministers. The institution  later became Wake Forest College.  Dr. Jones described Wake Forest as  ‘‘one of the best communities in the  State. The inhabitants, without, I believe, a single exception, are sober,  moral,  and  thriving  in  their  circumstances, and not a few are educated  and intelligent.’’  That is still true of Wake Forest. Although Wake Forest College moved to  Winston-Salem in 1956, the Southern  Baptist Convention  located  its new  seminary in Wake Forest, maintaining  Wake Forest’s reputation as a town of  higher learning and faith.  Wake Forest  is now a progressive  community of more than 27,000 residents. Forbes Magazine recently listed  Wake Forest as the 20th fastest-growing suburb in America. The residents of  Wake Forest now boast a vibrant town  with more than 100 businesses and a  rich  and well-maintained  historical  district.  I join the residents of Wake Forest in  their centennial celebration.  f  NAVY SEALS CAPTURE FALLUJAH  TERRORIST  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

2148,9,2009-12-01,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms.  for  the  strength and inspiration that she provides to so many women who are having to deal with this. And thank you  for sharing your story.  I rise today in support of H. Res. 727,  supporting the goals and ideals of National  Ovarian  Cancer  Awareness  Month. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest  of all gynecological cancers and is the  fifth  leading cause of death among  women in the United States of America. Ovarian cancer will occur in one  out of every 57 women. This year, approximately 20,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and more  than 15,000 will unfortunately die from  it.  Currently, there is no reliable early  detection test for ovarian cancer. In  June 2007, for the first time a national  consensus statement on ovarian cancer  symptoms was developed. It described  the symptoms, thereby making it easier for women to learn and remember  them. However, because of the lack of  reliable screening tests, 75 percent of  DELAURO)  ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in  an advanced stage, resulting in a survival rate of less than 45 percent. This  has to change.  It is critical to the victims of ovarian  cancer and their loved ones that a reliable screening test be developed to detect this dreaded cancer in its early  stages. In the meantime, the Ovarian  Cancer National Alliance holds a number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer and educates  women about the importance of knowing its common signs and symptoms.  During these events, they stress the  importance of routine doctor visits and  robust scientific research. During this  time and throughout the year, we need  to renew our commitment to fighting  this  illness that devastates all who  have been touched by this cancer and  takes  too many  lives  of  women  throughout the United States. I urge  my colleagues to support this important resolution, H. Res. 727.  My own mother passed away  from  breast cancer. Cancer kills too many  Americans, roughly 1,500 people a day  in this country. I think it is a shame  that we don’t give more national importance to fighting the war against  cancer.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
2149,9,2009-12-01,Mr. LYNCH.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Utah for his remarks, and I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. ISRAEL)  and the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DELAURO) for their leadership on  this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, ovarian cancer is one of  the deadliest forms of women’s cancer.  As noted by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, ovarian cancer  is now the eighth most common cancer  and the fifth leading cause of cancer  death among women  in  the United  States.  b1500  As has been noted earlier, in addition, and which has been commented  on by the American Cancer Society’s  annual ‘‘cancer facts and figures,’’ over  21,500 new cases of ovarian cancer will  have  been  diagnosed  and  approximately 14,600 women will have died  from  ovarian  cancer  in  2009  alone.  Moreover, the American Cancer Society additionally notes that a woman’s  risk  of  developing  invasive  ovarian  cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in  71, and estimates that a woman’s lifetime chance of dying  from  invasive  ovarian cancer is 1 in 95.  Despite  these  troubling  statistics,  with early detection and proper management, ovarian cancer can be highly  treatable. As noted by the American  Cancer Society, about 3 in 4 women  with ovarian cancer survive at least 1  year after diagnosis, and almost half of  women with ovarian cancer are still  alive at least 5 years after diagnosis.  And  if ovarian cancer  is  found and  treated before the cancer has spread  outside the ovary, the 5-year survival  rate is 93 percent.  However, while  ovarian  cancer  is  manageable if detected early, we know  that less than 20 percent of all ovarian  cancer is found at an early stage.  The Ovarian Cancer Coalition notes  that ovarian cancer can strike women  of any race and at any age, though  women who are over the age of 55 and  who have never been pregnant, have a  family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or have a personal history of cancer, are at higher risk of being diagnosed with the disease.  Accordingly, let us take this opportunity, through the passage of House  Resolution 727, to increase the awareness regarding this serious form of cancer and encourage all women to work  with their doctors in order to maximize  the possibility of early detection. And  this resolution has even greater importance in light of the health care debate  that goes on in the Senate right now.  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting House Resolution  727, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
2150,9,2009-12-01,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in strong support of House Resolution  727, which expresses  the House of Representatives’ support for the goals and ideals  of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.  As many of my colleagues hopefully know, on  August 31, 2009, President Obama issued a  Presidential Proclamation officially declaring  September National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, and calling on every American to  do their part to increase awareness of what  Americans can do to prevent and control ovarian cancer. Rising to the challenge, throughout  September, all across  the Nation, men and  women came together for events to both raise  awareness of this terrible scourge and to show  their support for the women and families struggling with this horrible disease—the deadliest  of the gynecologic cancers.  While National Ovarian Cancer Awareness  Month may be over for 2009, the fight against  ovarian cancer goes on. When it is detected  early, ovarian cancer is very treatable; unfortunately, ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to diagnose because symptoms  are sometimes subtle and may be easily confused with those of other diseases. As a result, only 29 percent of ovarian cancer cases  in the U.S. are diagnosed in the early stages.  When  the disease  is detected before  it has  spread beyond the ovaries, more than 95 percent of women will survive  longer  than  five  years. But, in cases where the disease is not  detected until it reaches the advanced stage,  the five-year survival rate plummets to a devastating 25 percent.  As there is still no reliable and easy-to-administer screening test for ovarian cancer, like  the Pap smear for cervical cancer or the mammogram for breast cancer; early recognition of  symptoms is clearly the best way to save a  woman’s life. Increased education and awareness about ovarian cancer, along with recognition of women who are at higher risk for developing ovarian cancer,  is  the only way  that  women and their doctors will be able to stop  ignoring or misinterpreting  the subtle symptoms of the disease.  In 2007, the American Cancer Society and  the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance came to  a consensus on the identifiable symptoms of  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:41 Dec 02, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K01DE7.020 H01DEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 3 S L C 5 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2009

2253,37,2009-12-01,Mr.  CRAPO.," Mr.  much time remains?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 41⁄2minutes remaining.  President,  how  The Senator from Idaho.  ",2009
2254,37,2009-12-01,Mr. CRAPO.," Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to conclude with our time  this morning by focusing on the larger  picture a little bit, as my colleague  from Tennessee has done in his concluding remarks.  When you ask Americans whether  they want health care reform, the vast  majority would say yes. When you ask  them what they mean by that, the vast  majority in the polls and in my personal experience are saying: We want  to see the spiraling costs of health care  and  our  health  insurance  brought  under  control and  reduced, and we  want to see increased access to quality  health care for those who do not have  access today and for those who have  limited access today.  This bill fails on those two central  points. What this legislation does, instead, is increase the size of government by $2.5 trillion of new Federal  spending,  establishing massive  new  Federal controls over the economy, and  even creating a Federal Government  insurance company. It increases taxes  by about $500 billion, and not just on  the so-called wealthy. The vast majority of these taxes is going to squarely  hit those who President Obama said  would not be hit: those who make less  than $200,000 a year and, frankly, all  the way down the income chain.  It cuts Medicare by $464 billion. It  puts a major new unfunded mandate on  our States, which are already struggling in their fiscal budgets. As my colleague indicated, it causes the price of  insurance premiums to go up for the  individual market, to go up  in the  small group insurance market, and to  be basically unchanged in the large insurance market, according to the CBO  study.  By the way, one of the things that is  not pointed out in that CBO study very  much is in that large market, which it  says will be the only part of the market that does not see insurance rates  go up, one of the reasons is because  their health care will go down. In other  words, there is a tax on these larger,  high-cost insurance premiums that is  going to be either passed through and  cause their insurance to go up or will  be avoided by reducing the cost of their  insurance and reducing coverage of the  benefits in these policies. So one way  or the other, all Americans are going  to see their health care premiums go  up or, in the large groups, see their  health care premiums be held the same  by reducing the quality of the insurance they have.  If you go back to those two reasons  Americans wanted health care reform,  did we see premiums go down? No. Did  we see increased quality or increased  access to care? Well, there are some  who are going to get a subsidy in this  program for this new massive Federal  program. But at what price? Mr. President, $2.5 trillion, $464 billion of cuts in  Medicare, the establishment of a major  new government program that would  essentially be funded on the backs of  massive new  tax  increases, massive  Federal tax  increases, and Medicare  cuts, and in the end we will still be in  a system in which we are seeing spiraling increases in health care costs.  To me, that is not the kind of reform  we need.  My colleague  from Tennessee  indicated there are a number of reforms on  which we can find common ground that  will reduce health care costs. There are  a number of reforms on which we can  find common ground that will help us  to increase access to quality care. That  is where our focus should be. That is  why I stand here today in support of  my colleague JOHNMCCAIN, his motion  to commit this legislation to the Finance Committee. As was indicated, it  could be done in 1 day, to simply remove the Medicare cuts that are contained within it. Let’s fix that part of  this bill, and then let’s work forward.  I see my time has expired. I encourage this Senate to focus closely on the  legislation and to let us work together  in a bipartisan  fashion  rather  than  speeding ahead and trying to pass legislation that has not had the opportunity for this kind of bipartisan effort  to develop a good work product for the  American people.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.  ",2009
2255,37,2009-12-01,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, our colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, I believe is on her way to the floor  of the Senate. She and several other  Members, in the time we have allocated to us between now and 11:30, will  address her amendment she proposed  yesterday. But pending her arrival, I  want to respond, if I could, very briefly  to some of the conversation here this  morning.  First, I know some people have short  memories,  but  I  am  somewhat  intrigued to hear our good friends and  colleagues talk about preserving Medicare. I have been around here a few  years and recall very vividly the debates of 1995 and 1997 on the issue of  Medicare, where our friends, who were  in the majority  in those days, were  talking about slowing the growth of  Medicare and one of the proposals they  had for doing so was to cut into the  benefits of Medicare recipients.  We do not do that in this bill at all.  Quite to the contrary, despite the language about ‘‘big cuts in Medicare,’’ we  strengthen the Medicare Program substantially. That  is  the  reason  the  AARP and other major organizations  involved with  the  elderly have  endorsed our proposals. They would hardly be doing so if they thought this was  some massive cut  into the Medicare  Program that has been so critical to so  many of our fellow citizens.  Just for a little bit of history here—  In 1995 our Republican colleagues proposed  cutting  benefits  to Medicare  beneficiaries.  Newt  Gingrich,  our  former Speaker and  friend  from the  other body, was quoted as saying ‘‘let’s  let Medicare wither on the vine.’’ That  is not ancient history. That is not 1965.

2256,44,2009-12-01,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Under  the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to report the  following nomination.

2257,44,2009-12-01,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Vermont is recognized.  ,2009
2258,44,2009-12-01,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President, I understand the Senator from California  desires some time. I yield her 5 minutes, beginning now.  ",2009
2259,44,2009-12-01,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Madam President,  I rise to speak in support of the nomination of California Superior Court  Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to be a Federal District Court Judge from the Central District of California. I urge her  confirmation.  Judge Nguyen is a tested judge with  a track record of success as both a  judge and a Federal prosecutor. She  will be the first Vietnamese American  on the Federal bench. Her nomination  comes about this way.  I have had, for a long time, a bipartisan judicial selection committee in  California  to  advise me  in  recommending  judicial  nominees  to  the  President. The committee gave Judge  Nguyen  its unanimous  recommendation. Then I recommended her to the  President  for his nomination to the  Federal district court. I believe she is  going to be an excellent Federal district court judge in the Central District.  Judge Nguyen was born  in South  Vietnam. She immigrated to this country with her family at the age of 10  during the final days of the Vietnam  war.  The  Nguyens  spent  several  months  living  in a refugee camp  in  Camp Pendleton, San Diego, before  moving to the La Crescenta neighborhood of Los Angeles. She was naturalized in 1984.  Judge Nguyen’s parents worked two  and three jobs at a time in Los Angeles, and Judge Nguyen and her siblings  worked side by side with them, cleaning a dental office, peeling and cutting  apples for a pie company, and finally  managing the doughnut shop that their  parents bought and owned.  In her application to my selection  committee, she explained that looking  back on these experiences she realizes  now  that  they were  difficult. She  wrote:  But I nevertheless feel incredibly fortunate  because those early years gave me invaluable life lessons that have shaped who I am  today.  She went on to graduate from Occidental College in 1987 and from UCLA  Law School in 1991. She was in the  Moot Court Honors Program.  For the first 4 years of her career,  she practiced commercial law as a litigation associate at  the private  law  firm of Musick, Peeler and Garrett,  where her caseload included complex  contract  disputes  and  intellectual  property cases. In 1995 she left the firm  to become an assistant U.S. attorney  in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles, and a very good one.  As an assistant U.S. attorney in the  criminal  division,  she  prosecuted  a  wide variety of crimes, including violent crimes, narcotics trafficking, organized crime, gun cases, and all kinds  of fraud. She spent 6 months in the organized crime strike force section, handling a title III wiretap investigation  of a Russian organized crime group responsible for smuggling sex slaves into  the United States from the Ukraine. In  2000, she received a special commendation from FBI Director Louis Freeh for  obtaining the first conviction ever in  the United States against a defendant  for providing material support to a designated terrorist organization.  The Justice Department recognized  her with three additional rewards for  superior performance as an assistant  U.S. attorney, and in 2000 she was promoted to deputy chief of the general  crimes section.  In 2002, Judge Nguyen left the U.S.  attorney’s office when Governor Gray  Davis appointed her to the Superior  Court in Los Angeles, and she has been  on that bench for more than 7 years  and has presided over more than 65  jury trials.  As she has said in her own words:  I am deeply passionate about the privileges  that we enjoy as Americans and am committed to spending my life in public service.  If I am given the honor to serve as a United  States District Judge, I believe my experiences, work ethic, maturity and judgment  will serve me well.  I could not agree more. I think Judge  Nguyen will be a truly outstanding  judge of the Federal district court and  I urge my colleagues to support her  nomination.  I yield the floor.  ",2009

2261,44,2009-12-01,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President, I absolutely concur with the comments of  the distinguished senior Senator from  California in support of the nomination  of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to serve on  the Federal Court in the Central District of California. I supported Judge  Nguyen  in the committee and I am  glad we are able to act on her nomination today.  Judge Nguyen participated in a confirmation hearing before the Judiciary  Committee on September 23. Hers was  a historic hearing at which,  for the  first time, three Asian Pacific American  judicial nominees appeared  together—Judge Nguyen, Dolly Gee and  Judge Edward  Chen.  Indeed,  three  Asian Pacific American judicial nominees have never been confirmed in the  same year. Of the 876 active  judges  serving on our Federal courts, only 8  are Asian Pacific American.  We also held a November hearing for  Judge Denny Chin, a well-respected  judge on the Southern District of New  York, whom President Obama has nominated for elevation to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Chin was  the first Asian Pacific American appointed as a Federal district court  judge outside the Ninth Circuit. If confirmed to the Second Circuit, he will be  the only active Asian Pacific American  judge to serve on a Federal appellate  court anywhere in the country. It is  unbelievable that with 179 Federal appellate court judgeships in our country, none are currently held by an  Asian Pacific American.

2266,51,2009-12-01,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, I have to  address the situation since I have been  accused  by  the majority  leader  of  changing my position. The Senate considered the Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 which called for approximately $10  billion in reduction in Medicare costs,  approximately  $10  billion.  Senator  HARRYREID, Democrat of Nevada, said:  Unfortunately, the Republican budget is an  immoral document. Let’s look at what is in  the bill before us. The budget increases burdens on America’s  seniors by  increasing  Medicare premiums, and we have not seen  what the House is going to give us. It cuts  health care, both Medicare and Medicaid, by  a total of $27 billion.  The majority leader was outraged in  2005 that there should be reductions in  Medicare and Medicaid spending of $27  billion. Now the distinguished majority  leader, with the white smoke coming  out of his office, says he is for $483 billion in cuts in Medicare. That is a remarkable flip-flop.  By the way, I might add, Senator  DODD, who is here on the floor, said,  concerning the Deficit Reduction Act  of 2005:  For example, this bill cuts  funding  for  Medicare and Medicaid which provide health  care  to poor children, working men and  women, the disabled, and the elderly.  What a plea. What a plea.  Senator BARBARABOXERsaid:  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the reconciliation bill before the Senate. The bill  would cut vital programs  for the middle  class, elderly, and poor. That is why I cannot  believe only 2 months after Katrina we have  a bill that would cut Medicare and Medicaid  by $27 billion.  The list goes on and on.  Now before us we have cuts of $483  billion,  including hospice, hospitals,  other vital programs for our seniors. If  we are going to go around and talk  about flip-flops, let’s look at the rhetoric that accompanied my colleagues  on the other side in their opposition to  $27 billion  in savings which, by the  way, actually only saved $2 to $3 billion over 5 years.  I ask my friend from Oklahoma, does  he believe it is possible to make these  cuts, including from the Medicare Advantage  Program,  and  establish  a  Medicare commission that would not,  over time, cut benefits that exist today  for Medicare and Medicaid patients?  ",2009
2267,51,2009-12-01,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I would  answer my colleague by saying this bill  is a government-centered approach, not  a patient-centered approach. It is the  very reason we are in the trouble we  are in today. We have had the government making decisions rather than the  patients and the physicians. It will, in  fact, lessen the care for seniors.  I gave a speech earlier this morning  on the floor that if you are a senior,  you should be worried. Because the  Medicare Advisory Commission and the  cost  comparative  effectiveness  commission will now decide ultimately  what you get. We have an amendment  on the floor, which in many ways I support but I would like to modify, about  reinstituting what should be the standard for mammography for women. How  did we get there? We have a commission that looks at cost and not patients. From a cost standpoint, the  task force on screening is absolutely  right. But  from the patient’s standpoint, it is absolutely wrong. How do  we decide the difference? Do we make  the difference based on what something  costs or do we make it on what my  wife, who will soon be a Medicare patient, receives? The question is, will  the cuts that are manifested by this  bill impact seniors’ care? As somebody  who has practiced medicine for 25 years  and cared for seniors for longer than  that, I will tell you undoubtedly they  will have delay, denied care, and 80 percent of them will be fine. But 20 percent of the seniors in this country will  be markedly hurt by this bill because a  bureaucracy looking at numbers, not  patients, never putting their hand on  the patient, will make a decision about  what is good for them and what is not.  Everything we know about medicine  is that is exactly the wrong way to  practice it. Every patient is different.  Every patient’s family history is different. When we talk about taking $120  billion out of the Medicare Advantage  Program, what we are talking about is  decreasing access to some of the most  important screening capabilities that  many of these people have and making  them unaffordable because they cannot  afford a supplemental Medicare policy.  They cannot accomplish it.  I want to address one other question.  The majority whip  said  the Republicans have not had a bill. During the  markup  in  the HELP Committee,  I  went through point by point the Patients’  Choice  Act.  The  Patients’  Choice Act puts patients and doctors in  charge, not the government in charge.  The Patients’ Choice Act neutralizes  the tax effect to make everybody treated the same in this country, as far as  the IRS is concerned.  Right now,  if you  get  insurance  through your insurance company, you  get $2,700 worth of tax benefits. If you  do not, you get $100. That is really fair.  That is one of the reasons why people  who do not get insurance through their  employer cannot afford health insurance. It is because we do not give them  the same tax benefit. It would give a  tax cut to 95 percent of Americans,  plus help them buy their care.  The Patients’ Choice Act solves the  liability  problem  by  incentivizing  States to have reforms in terms of the  tort problem we have, where we know  the cost is at least 6 to 7 percent more  that we have spent on health care than  we would if we had a realistic tort system.  Finally, we go after insurance companies because we do what is called  risk readjustment. If you are dumping  patients  or  cherry-picking—guess  what—you have to pay extra; you have  to pay to the very insurance companies  that are covering those sick people. So  we change the incentive to where an  insurance company is incentivized to  care for somebody rather than to dump  them.  I was an advocate, when I was in the  House, for the Patients’ Bill of Rights.

2277,65,2009-12-01,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I want  to talk principally about the Medicare  cuts in this bill and make sure that  people understand the context in which  this takes place and what it means in  terms of benefits for seniors.  There has been a lot of parsing of  language here in a way that I think  can perhaps obscure the real impact of  these proposals.  First,  let me  say  there  is broad  agreement that our health care system  needs reform. But I thought the purpose of that reform was to lower costs  and make it more affordable—not raise  premiums, raise taxes, and cut Medicare benefits.  Again, I say to our friends across the  aisle, no one wants the status quo. But  it is clear that our friends across the  aisle are not  interested  in any proposals from this side of the aisle, as  demonstrated by the party-line votes  in the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee,  and  the  product  coming from the House of Representatives.  This is simply too important to do on  a purely partisan basis. Yet that seems  to be the intention of the majority.  The American people want us to get  this right because they understand this  impacts 17 percent of our economy, and  it affects all 300 million of us. This is  important  to  them. As  they  have  watched these debates and proposals,  as they have learned more about them,  it is no mystery why public opinion for  these proposals has dropped  like a  rock. Again, it has dropped like a rock.  First of all, on cost, they realize that  the proposals as made have masked the  true cost of this bill, and there was  celebration when  the  bill  came  in  under $900 billion. Forget the fact it  doesn’t actually go into effect until 4  years into the 10-year budget window,  so it was only 6 years of implementation; and never mind that it didn’t include reversing the 23-percent cut in  physician payments that go into effect  at the first part of next year, unless  Congress acts. That was left out intentionally  to make  this  look cheaper  than it is.  The Senate Budget Committee has  pointed out that this bill, when fully  implemented, would cost the American  people $2.5 trillion. I have constituents  who asked me: Do you know what a  trillion dollars is? They say: I don’t  know. We used to talk about a million  dollars being a lot of money, and then  a billion dollars. Now we are into the  trillions—hence,  the bumper  sticker  ‘‘don’t tell Congress what comes after a  trillion,’’ for fear we will spend it.  This bill, written by the majority  leader behind closed doors,  increases  taxes by nearly $1⁄2 trillion on American families and small businesses during the worst recession we have had  since the Great Depression. Unemployment is 10.2 percent, and it is perhaps  headed higher. This bill proposes to  make it harder on businesses to retain  employees, or perhaps maybe someday  hire employees and bring down that  unemployment rate.  This is a job-killing bill. That is why  the American people, the more they  learn about it, like it less and less. I  predict that the longer this debate goes  on, the more they learn about it, the  less they will find to like about the bill  for that and many other reasons.  This bill also, according to the CBO,  increases health  insurance premiums  by $2,100  for American  families purchasing insurance on their own. If you  are fortunate and you have large group  coverage, it is a little better. But for  the millions who are not, it increases  the cost of their insurance by $2,100 a  year.  I want to focus primarily on the cuts  in Medicare. When our colleagues celebrate the fact that this comes back  budget neutral,  let me explain that  mystery. That means you have raised  taxes so much and cut Medicare benefits so much, you can claim it is budget  neutral. I daresay that is not cause for  celebration. In order to create a $2.5  trillion new entitlement program—and  that is what this is, at a time when the  unfunded liabilities of our current entitlement programs go somewhere into  the $40 trillion to $60 trillion range—  this bill actually cuts $465 billion in  payments from Medicare. These cuts  include $135 billion to hospitals; $120  billion from 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage, including a half million—or to be more precise, 523,000 Texans who depend on Medicare Advantage  will see a cut in benefits because of  this proposal if it passes.  Mr. President, $15 billion will be cut  from nursing homes, $40 billion will be  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:25 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S01DE9.REC S01DE9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009
2278,72,2009-12-01,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the Mikulski amendment and to discuss the importance of  preventive health care for women.  All women should have access to the  same affordable preventive health care  services as women who serve in Congress.  The Mikulski amendment will ensure  that is the case.  It will require plans to cover, at no  cost,  basic  preventive  services  and  screenings for women.  This may include mammograms, pap  smears,  family  planning,  and  screenings to detect heart disease, diabetes,  or  postpartum  depression—in  other words, basic services that are a  part of  every woman’s health  care  needs at some point in life.  We often like to think of the United  States as a world leader in health care,  with the best and most efficient system. The facts do not bear this out.  The United States spends more per  capita on health care than other industrialized nations but has worse results.  According  to  the  Commonwealth  Fund, the United States ranks 15th in  ‘‘avoidable mortality.’’ This measures  how many people in each country survive a potentially fatal, yet treatable  medical  condition. And  the United  States  lags  behind France,  Japan,  Spain, Sweden, Italy, Australia, Canada, and several other nations.  According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 24th  in the world in healthy life expectancy.  This measures how many years a person can expect to live at full health.  The United States again trails Japan,  Australia, France, Sweden and many  other countries.  These  statistics  show we are not  spending our resources wisely. We are  not finding and treating people with  conditions that can be controlled.  Part of the answer, without question,  is  expanding  coverage.  Too many  Americans cannot afford basic health  care because they lack basic health insurance.  The Mikulski amendment, and providing affordable access to preventive  care, is another part of the answer.  Women  need  preventive  care,  screenings, and tests so that potentially serious or fatal illnesses can be  found early and treated effectively.  We all know  individuals who have  benefited from this type of care.  A mammogram identifies breast cancer, before it has spread.  A pap smear finds precancerous cells  that  can  be  removed  before  they  progress to cancer and cause serious  health problems.  Cholesterol testing or a blood pressure  reading  suggest  that a person  might  have  cardiovascular  disease,  which can be controlled with medication or lifestyle changes.  This is how health care should work:  a problem found early and addressed  early. The Mikulski amendment will  give more women access to this type of  care.  Statistics about life expectancy and  avoidable mortality can make it easy  to forget that we are talking about real  patients and real people who die too  young because  they  lack access  to  health care.  Physicians for Reproductive Choice  and Health shared the following story,  which  comes  from  Dr.  William  Leininger in California.  He states:  In my last year of residency, I cared for a  mother of two who had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23. At that time,  she was covered by her husband’s insurance,  but it was an abusive relationship, and she  lost her health  insurance when  they divorced.  For the next five years, she had no health  insurance and never received follow-up care  (which would have revealed that her cancer  had returned). She eventually remarried and  regained health insurance, but by the time  she came back to see me, her cancer had  spread.  She had two children from her previous  marriage—her driving motivation during her  last rounds of palliative care was to survive  long enough to ensure that her abusive ex-  husband wouldn’t gain custody of her kids  after her death. She succeeded. She was 28  when she died.

2279,79,2009-12-01,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, section  301 of S. Con.

The  Cartagena  review  conference  would have been  the perfect opportunity for the Obama administration  to announce its intention to join the  156 other nations that are parties to  the treaty, including our coalition allies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In fact, every member of NATO and  every country in our hemisphere, except Cuba, is a party to the treaty. The  United States is one of only 37 countries that have not joined, along with  Russia and China.  By announcing our intention to join  the treaty in Cartagena, this administration would have signaled to the rest  of the world that the United States is  finally showing the leadership that has  been wanting on these indiscriminate  weapons that maim and kill thousands  of innocent people every year.  The U.S. military is the most powerful in the world. Yet we have seen how  civilian casualties in Afghanistan have  become one of the most urgent and  pressing concerns of our military commanders, where  bombs  that missed  their targets and other mistakes have  turned the populace against us.  Despite this, one of the arguments  the Pentagon makes for resisting calls  to join the Mine Ban Treaty is to preserve its option to use landmines in Afghanistan, even though we have not  used  these  indiscriminate  weapons  since 1991.  Since the Pentagon has never voluntarily given up any weapon, including  poison gas, which President Woodrow  Wilson renounced in 1925, perhaps this  is to be expected.  But can anyone imagine the United  States using landmines in Afghanistan,  a country where more civilians have  been killed or horribly  injured  from  mines than any other in history?  A country which, like our coalition  partners, is itself a party to the treaty?  A country where if we used mines  and civilians were killed or injured the  public  outcry  in  Afghanistan  and  around the world would be deafening?  Can anyone imagine this President,  who has been awarded the Nobel Peace  Prize which only a few years ago was  awarded to the International Campaign  to Ban Landmines, having to publicly  defend such a decision?  I wonder if anyone at the Pentagon  has thought of the military and political implications of that.  Last Tuesday, the State Department  spokesman announced that the administration had completed a review on its  landmine policy and had decided to  continue supporting the Bush administration’s policy, which was, in key aspects, a  retreat  from  the policy of  President Clinton.  This was a surprise to me and others,  as I had encouraged the administration  to conduct such a review and then  heard nothing for months. In fact, I  had spoken personally with President  Obama about it just a few weeks before.  I did not hesitate to express my disappointment,  as  did many  others.  Thereafter the State Department corrected  itself, and announced  that a  ‘‘comprehensive review’’ is continuing  and reaffirmed its earlier decision to  send  a  team  of  observers  to  the  Cartagena review conference this week.  It is unfortunate that the State Department spokesman misspoke. However, the administration’s approach to  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:25 Mar 11, 2010 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\S01DE9.REC S01DE9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009

Some people had all but lost hope that they would compete in the playoffs, but the playoffs were just  the beginning of  their Cinderella rise  to  the  top. Beginning with their first win in the playoffs against defending champions Columbus  Crew and ending with the final win over the  star-studded  LA Galaxy, Real  Salt  Lake  proved themselves to be a championship-caliber team.  Rather than relying on a few star players,  this team proved the power of teamwork and  the value of believing in one another. Led by  their first-time coach/former player Jason Kreis  and Captain Kyle Beckerman, they validated  to the world what they already knew. Never  giving up, Real came from behind to win in a  high pressure penalty kick. We would like to  congratulate Real Salt Lake and thank them  for bringing a championship home to Utah.  f  HONORING NSF INTERNATIONAL’S  65TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. JOHN D. DINGELL  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 1, 2009  ",2009
2285,107,2009-12-01,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate NSF  International and  thank  them for the great work they have done over  the last 65 years. Since 1944, when it was established  at  the University  of Michigan’s  School of Public Health,  in Ann Arbor, NSF  International has gone on to reach innumerable achievements.  NSF International has established itself as a  leader  in  the  field of drinking water safety,  food safety, indoor air, organic certification, toy  safety, and many other areas of public health  and safety. In 1984 NSF International opened  its  first office abroad  in Brussels, Belgium.  Just over 20 years later NSF International now  maintains  offices  and  laboratories  across  North America and Europe, as well as  in  South America, Africa, and Asia. I believe their  selection as a Collaborating Centre on Food  and Water Safety as well as Indoor Environment by the World Health Organization speaks  to their outstanding international reputation in  the field.  Most importantly, NSF International has protected an untold number of consumers over  the last 65 years through their testing, certification, education, and other services. Consumer safety is critically important and is an  issue I have worked diligently on during my  career  in  the United States House of Representatives. Protecting consumers from dangerous products would not be possible without  the role that independent, not-for-profit organizations, such as NSF International, play.  This role is particularly important with our increasingly global marketplace. As more and  more products come to the United States from  abroad, extra steps must be taken to ensure  American consumers are receiving the safest  products  possible.  NSF  International  has  played a key role in certifying products worldwide as well as writing internationally recognized standards. I thank them for the very important work they do.  I am proud to say that an organization with  such an outstanding  reputation domestically  and  internationally, and an organization with  so many years of experience and achievement, was founded and is still headquartered  in the great city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. It is  organizations such as NSF International that  make Michigan, and Michigan’s 15th District,  such a wonderful place and make me so  proud to represent the area. I ask all my colleagues  to  join me  in  congratulating and  thanking NSF International.  f  RECOGNIZING DAN CALLAHAN  HON. JERRY F. COSTELLO  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 1, 2009  ",2009
2286,107,2009-12-01,Mr. COSTELLO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring one of my constituents, Dan Callahan,  the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois  University, and  congratulate him on being  awarded  the Missouri Valley Conference’s  Most Courageous Award. This award honors  those  that have demonstrated unusual courage in the face of personal illness, adversity,  or tragedy.  In his 16 years at SIU, Coach Callahan has  contributed a great deal to the community. He  is well-known and respected for not just his  coaching skills, but also for his ability to inspire off of the field.  Three years ago, Coach Callahan was diagnosed with a very rare and very serious form  of skin cancer. Despite undergoing treatment  for the cancer, including surgery, Coach Callahan did not miss a game that season. Sadly,  the cancer continued to grow. He faced more  intense treatments, but was given hope when  his oncologist  recommended a new drug,  Avastin,  that can stop  the spread of cancer  and in some cases even shrink tumors. His  doctor tried it on him and it worked. However,  his insurance company will not cover the cost  of the drug that is keeping Dan Callahan alive.  He now has no choice regarding his treatment. He cannot afford what his doctor recommends and his insurance company will not  cover  it. He cannot get new  insurance because of his history of cancer. This could happen to anyone.  His experiences are well documented in the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial that I would  like added to the RECORD.  I wanted to make my colleagues aware of  Dan’s  situation,  congratulate  him  on  his  award, and wish him luck on the baseball field  and especially in his recovery.  I submit an editorial from the St. Louis Post-  Dispatch which was published November 6,  2009, relating to Dan Callahan’s case.

2287,114,2009-12-01,Mrs. CAPITO.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to inform my colleagues of the pending retirement of Marshal J.C. Raffety from not only his  position as United States Marshal  for  the  Northern District of West Virginia, but from an  exceptional career  in  law enforcement  that  spans the past five decades.  Specifically, on January 1, 2010, after nearly  eight years of service as U.S. Marshal, J.C.  will graciously relinquish his duties and begin  his life anew as a private citizen of the State  of West Virginia. Raffety will leave this post  with an outstanding  legacy of achievement.  During his tenure, Marshal Raffety supported  the establishment of  the Northern District’s  Mountain State Fugitive Task Force, which  has components located in Clarksburg, Martinsburg, and Wheeling, West Virginia. This  Task Force, comprised of  local, State and  Federal law enforcement agencies, is responsible  for  the apprehension of violent  fugitive  offenders. In addition, this Task Force participates  in Operation FALCON, Federal And  Local Cops Organized Nationally, an annual,  nationwide fugitive round-up that relies on the  combined efforts of Federal, State, and local  law enforcement agencies and departments.  Under Raffety’s capable leadership, the Northern District of West Virginia’s efforts involving  Operation FALCON netted the arrests of hundreds of  fugitives  from  justice, and stands  today as a shining example of effective interagency cooperation and coordination. Additionally, very early into his appointment, Marshal Raffety was selected  to serve on  the  then-USMS Director’s Advisory Committee, a  testament to his decades of training and experience in the Federal, State, and local law enforcement communities.  President  George W.  Bush  appointed  Raffety  to  the position of U.S. Marshal on  March 13, 2002. Prior to that, J.C. served as  the Chief of Police for the city of Buckhannon,  West Virginia,  for approximately  two years.  During his tenure, Chief Raffety promoted the  established concept of community policing and  instituted meaningful administrative  reforms.  Additionally, he strengthened ties with the students and administrators of West Virginia  Wesleyan College and enhanced  the Neighborhood Watch Program in Buckhannon.  Before his service as Chief of Police  in  Buckhannon, Raffety spent a remarkable 32-  year career with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, which began in 1966 when, following high school graduation at  the age of  18, he  relocated  to Washington, DC, and  began working for the FBI as a GS–2 Clerk.  While employed at  the FBI, J.C. attended  night school full-time towards the attainment of  his college degree. After a 2-year break  in  service  to complete his undergraduate education, Raffety was reinstated  to  the FBI  in  1970, and attended  the FBI Academy at  Quantico, Virginia. Early  in his career, J.C.  served as an FBI Special Agent in Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh,  and  Erie,  Pennsylvania,  where his investigative efforts focused on organized crime, racketeering, and public corruption. He later served as a Supervisory Special Agent at FBI Headquarters in Washington,  DC, assigned to the Criminal Investigative Division, Organized  Crime  Section.  Subsequently, in 1983, Raffety was assigned to the  Clarksburg, West Virginia Resident Agency,  and later served as Supervisory Senior Resident Agent for that office, a position he held  until his retirement in 2000. Among the highlights of his  impressive  record  in West Virginia, J.C. served as the lead case agent in  the 1995–1997 West Virginia Mountaineer Militia investigation, which resulted in the convictions of militia members engaged in a domestic terrorism plot targeting the FBI’s Criminal  Justice Information Services, CJIS, Center in  Clarksburg, as well as the Internal Revenue  Service, IRS, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives, BATF,  facilities  in  West Virginia’s eastern panhandle.  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to  call to the attention of my colleagues the extraordinary accomplishments of J.C. Raffety. I  admire his idealism and lifelong commitment  to his community, State, and country. I join his  wife, Cindy, his two children and two grandchildren, and the grateful citizens of West Virginia  in  thanking J.C.  for his  life of service,  and in wishing him continued success as he  enters this new chapter of his life. Congratulations, Marshal Raffety, on a job well done!  f  A TRIBUTE TO MRS. SAJDA  MUSAWWIR LADNER  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS–  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 1, 2009  ",2009

According to the non-partisan Congressional  Budget Office, the forecast deficit for this year  is $1.6  trillion. That means  that so  far  this  year, we borrowed and spent an average $4.4  billion a day more  than we have collected,  passing that debt and its interest payments to  our children and all future Americans.

2294,4,2009-12-09,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Speaker, this  week debate continues in the Senate  over a massive health care overhaul.  What’s at stake for seniors? Many seniors will probably see their benefits cut  or higher premiums. The Senate bill  cuts more than $135 billion from hospitals serving seniors. It cuts $40 billion from home health agencies, $15 billion from nursing homes, and nearly $8  billion from hospices—an all-important  service our seniors depends on.  Seniors deserve to know how Washington Democrats are going to pay for  their massive new government-run bureaucracy because cuts like these will  affect their care.  As a heart surgeon, I know that we  can do better. We need to work together to strengthen Medicare, putting  it on sound footing to ensure that it  will be there when seniors need help  with their health care costs.  We need to lower health care costs  for seniors and all Americans by increasing competition in the insurance  marketplace, promoting wellness programs, and limiting frivolous lawsuits  in medicine. We can accomplish these  commonsense solutions if we work together.  Let’s protect seniors. Let’s protect  Medicare.  f  AMERICAN JOBS ARE TRENDING  IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
2295,4,2009-12-09,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, while  one month with fewer job losses does  not show success, it certainly shows  that we are trending in the right direction.  This blue is since President Obama  took office; the red is the time under  former President Bush. You see back in  January of 2008 we started losing jobs.  Here  is when  the Presidential candidate  for  the Republicans  claimed  that the fundamentals of our economy  were sound. And in the last month that  President Bush was in office, this country lost over 740,000 jobs.  The blue shows the direction under  the Obama administration where we  are trending in the right direction. It’s  not success, but it certainly shows we  are trending in the right direction from  over 70,000 jobs to 11,000 jobs. It’s a  tragedy for any family that has lost a  job, but it does show that one election  has  truly made a difference  in our  economy.  f  JOBS AND THE ECONOMY  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
2296,4,2009-12-09,Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, you know the American people deserve some answers. Where are  the jobs? Ten months after passing a  $787 billion stimulus package, unemployment has reached 10 percent and  thousands of workers have stayed unemployed for 6 months or more. Unfortunately,  the Democrats  still  think  throwing money  at  the  struggling  economy will fix it.  Albert Einstein once said, ‘‘The definition of insanity is doing the same  thing over and over again expecting  different results.’’ The first stimulus  didn’t work. The new stimulus would  only increase the already massive deficit and provide a temporary fix.  Higher taxes and higher spending is  not the formula for economic growth.  What America really needs is to encourage entrepreneurial activity, help  small businesses, and get the government out of our pockets.  f  OPPOSITION TO STUPAK-PITTS  AMENDMENT  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2009
2297,4,2009-12-09,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I’ve  witnessed the horror of choice between  back alley abortions and sometimes  unforced marriages to try to avoid disgrace. Those were the realities that  women faced prior to 1973. My fear is if  this harmful Stupak-Pitts language is  signed into law, we will revert back to  those dark times.  Critical to this debate is a breakdown  of the facts. The opposition says that it  codifies current law. It is grossly incorrect. Stupak-Pitts goes far beyond current  law, placing unprecedented  restrictions on the  individual’s use of  their own private dollars. The Hyde  amendment does not apply to private  funding nor does it apply to administrative costs. It has only placed limits  on direct Federal appropriations being  used to fund abortion benefits. That  brings in everyone who has insurance  from their employer, which is tax exempt, which means, of course, a Federal subsidy.  The Hyde amendment does not include similar,  far-reaching  language.  Seventeen  States  currently  provide  abortion  coverage without  separate  funding.  We must not go back to the back  alley.  f  UNITED STATES IN DANGER OF  LOSING ITS CREDIT RATING  (Mrs. SCHMIDT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

2298,4,2009-12-09,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  again this morning to remind this body  that we must stop this runaway spending in Congress or we are in jeopardy of  losing our AAA credit  rating. This  would greatly hurt the United States  of America’s credit.  Moody’s  Investment Services  indicates the United States will lose its  AAA rating  in 2013  if Congress continues to put us on this fiscal train  wreck of too much spending and record  Federal deficits. The Federal deficit for  2009 was  $1.4  trillion,  tripling  our  record. The President’s own Office of  Management and Budget estimated in  August that the budget deficit would  be more than $9 trillion over the next  10 years. Add this to the $12 trillion in  U.S. debt, and we’re on a track to nearly double our record.  Mr. Speaker, we must stop the spending and stop it now.  f  THE BIRTHERS AND DENIERS ARE  WRONG  (Mr. INSLEE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
2299,4,2009-12-09,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, the President is right to go to Copenhagen and  lead the world against global warming.  He is right to defeat the birthers who  have  tried  to  stop him  from being  President and the deniers who refuse to  accept the fact of global warming. Both  the birthers and the deniers refuse to  accept clear, pure facts.  I just read that a former Governor of  Alaska was arguing today in a newspaper that there is no such thing as  global warming associated with human  activity. She needs to read the National Academy  of Sciences  report  which concludes it is a fact. She needs  to read the report of NASA—the people  who put the men on the Moon—that  concludes this is a fact. She needs to  read the NOAA reports about acidification of the ocean which shows it is a  fact.  The birthers and  the deniers are  wrong. We  should  restore American  leadership and make sure the jobs of  the future clean energy economy are  here, not just in China. The President  is right; the deniers are wrong yet  again.  f  WHERE ARE THE JOBS  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

2300,4,2009-12-09,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, in January,  President Obama  and  congressional  Democrats promised spending another  trillion dollars would create jobs immediately  and  that  unemployment  would not rise above 8 percent. Almost  1 year later, millions of Americans are  still plagued by unemployment and  many are  struggling  to make  ends  meet. In October, 190,000 jobs were lost  and more than 2.8 million jobs have  been lost since the so-called stimulus  was signed by President Obama.  The American people  continue  to  ask, Where are the jobs? I can safely  say the answer lies in the House Republican economic recovery plan.

2305,25,2009-12-09,Mr. LEVIN.," Let’s be clear what’s involved in the pay-fors: tax-haven legislation, also the issue of fairness.  Those who invest their own money  will continue to receive capital gains  tax treatment, period. Those who manage other people’s money will have to  pay ordinary income tax like everybody else who performs services. There  is widespread support for this.  Gregory Mankiw, who was on President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors, said this:  ‘‘Deferred compensation, even risky compensation, is still  compensation, and it should be taxed  as such . . . When I wrote my book,  that was sweat equity . . . I oppose different levels of taxation on different  types of compensation.’’  This from a former member of President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisors, William Niskanen: ‘‘The share  of investment profits are basically fees  for managing other people’s money.’’  Also, another person who was deputy  undersecretary  under  George  H.W.  Bush, Professor Michael Graetz:  ‘‘I  think it’s odd that people making that  much money off of essentially labor income  should be paying  lower  rates  than, than the average . . . than their  secretaries are, to put it baldly.’’  And then from the New York Times:  ‘‘They’re actively managing assets, and  should be taxed accordingly as managers earning compensation . . . Congress will achieve a significant victory,  for  fairness and  for  fiscal  responsibility, if it ends the breaks that are  skewing the Tax Code in favor of the  most advantaged Americans.’’  And likewise, the Washington Post:  ‘‘But  these  fund managers,  for  the  most part, are not risking their own  money.’’ And I  insert to the extent  they are, they get capital gains treatment. ‘‘Besides, plenty of risky industries don’t enjoy comparable tax benefits. Income earned from managing an  investment partnership fund should be  treated just like the income earned for  providing any other service.’’  And I could quote this from William  Stanfill, who’s a manager of venture  capital. He says, ‘‘Many Americans invest sweat equity  in their  jobs and  their businesses, take risks, contribute  to the economy, and may have to wait  a  long time before their hard work  pays off. But they still pay ordinary income tax rates on their compensation.  To the extent we take risk, we take it  with other people’s money.’’  And that’s why the statement of administration policy is very clear from  the President. ‘‘The legislation would  fulfill  the  administration’s  commitment to crack down on overseas tax  havens and put a stop to billions of dollars’ worth of tax abuse and would end  the special preferential treatment for  carried interest income.’’  ",2009
2306,25,2009-12-09,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  time of the gentleman has again expired.  ,2009
2307,25,2009-12-09,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts., I yield  the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.  ,2009
2308,25,2009-12-09,Mr. LEVIN.," In terms of sparking economic growth, we need to have measures that target investment, not give a  special break  for those who perform  services. For example, I have  introduced a bill to eliminate capital gains  on investments in certain small business stock  for 2010. On  investments.  That’s the issue here, that nobody blur  it. Those who work with other people’s  money will pay ordinary income tax;  those who invest their own money will  continue to receive capital gains tax  treatment.  ",2009
2309,25,2009-12-09,Mr. CAMP.," At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished member  of  the Ways  and  Means Committee, the gentleman from  Texas  (Mr. BRADY), who has been a  leader in the effort to restore the local  sales tax deduction.  ",2009
2310,25,2009-12-09,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise and strongly oppose this bill.  Encouraging research jobs on the one  hand while killing local real estate and  construction jobs on the other makes  no economic sense. In making one of  our most vulnerable sectors, commercial real estate, which faces the next  real crisis in America, making that situation worse is going to kill jobs in  this country. That type of thing is the  reason that this new Congress and this  White House has  failed  to get  the  American economy going.  Let me explain. There are parts of  this bill that all of us support, including cracking down on tax evaders but  encouraging  companies  to keep  research and development jobs; letting  States, local taxpayers, write off the  State and local sales taxes. And our  State, I’m proud to say, we fought to  restore this. It saves our taxpayers $1.2  billion  a  year,  creates  22,000  jobs.  That’s  fairness.  In helping  teachers  write off, for example, their supplies  they pay out of their pocket to help  educate their students, we all agree on  that. That’s not the question.  But what they do in this bill as well,  they target some of our most basic  companies at home. They say they’re  going after those Wall Street managers  of your money, the ones who have their  feet up on the desk who just shuffle  money back and forth and make billions of dollars. That’s what they say  they’re aiming at. What they’re hitting  is Main Street, our real estate partnerships. These are our local companies  that build our office buildings, apartments, shopping centers, movie theaters, our industrial parks. There are no  abuses in this. These are the people  who create jobs at home.  This bill increases their tax, almost  triples their taxes, and these are people  who put in sweat equity for 15 years, 20  years. Only if they get it right do they  make a dollar back on all of their hard  work. This is who they nearly triple  the taxes on.  These are the people, 1.2 million, traditional real estate partnerships, who  will pay the price if this bill passes, because this makes no economic sense  and damages jobs. That’s why this bill  is dead on arrival in the Senate, deader  than a doornail, because with  this  economy, we ought to be creating jobs  and not killing jobs.  ",2009
2311,25,2009-12-09,Mr. NEAL  of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, a  reminder  that  there are  303,000 people in the State of Texas who  will not be able to deduct their higher  education tuition costs. That is for the  State of Texas a $690 million benefit.  With that, I would yield 30 seconds to  the  gentleman  from Vermont  (Mr.  WELCH).  ",2009
2312,25,2009-12-09,Mr. WELCH.," Mr. Speaker, we spend  more on tax expenditures authorized  by Congress and  the Committee on  Ways and Means than we do on the entire appropriations budget.  It really  matters. This  is the third year I’ve  served  in Congress,  the  third year  we’ve had tax extenders. And the question for many of us is the one that was  raised by Chairman RANGEL: Is it time  to take a look at this, kick the tires of  each one of these to see not just how it  affects the particular beneficiary—they  always are in favor—but how it affects  the  overall  economy  for  creating  wealth in jobs and how it affects the  burden of fairness that is our responsibility? So I applaud the chairman in  his effort to do that.  ",2009

2314,25,2009-12-09,Mr. ROSKAM.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I think  it’s a sad argument,  ironically, that the majority is using, and  that is to kind of procedurally hold  hostage, a group of teachers who are  counting on predictability and clarity  and  forthrightness and  transparency  from this Congress, and now it is 21  days before a tax provision upon which  they are going to rely is now dangling  before them.  And what this House is being told by  the majority  is either you vote  for  these teachers or you push them off,  and these are your choices.  Is that  really as good as it gets? Is that really  as robust a tax provision and a tax policy that we can come up with, to dangle a group of teachers out and sort of  manipulate them on the House floor in  terms of an argument and say, ‘‘You’re  either for teachers or you’re not’’?

When in the  19th century the Bourbons were restored after the French Revolution, it  was said of them that they had forgotten nothing because they learned nothing.  That’s my Republican  colleagues.  They have learned absolutely nothing  from the fact that a total absence of  regulation caused this enormous financial crisis.  Do we care about jobs, yes. We don’t  want, as their bill would do, their substitute to allow an AIG to continue to  do what it did to allow subprime mortgages to continue, to allow executive  pay to have that perverse incentive.  Yes, we are trying to prevent another  job loss like the one President Obama  inherited from President Bush.  ",2009

2329,39,2009-12-09,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  bill, the so-called Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act of 2009.  Unfortunately, as has been said, there  is not much taxpayer protection in the  bill, and there is even less Wall Street  reform.  Now, I see this bill as nothing more  than a permanent bailout and a job  killer. I must say I relish the opportunity to rise in the immediate aftermath of the formidable debating skills  of the chairman of this committee, who  I respect, both personally and as a colleague.  But I respectfully differ with him on  this bailout, as I did on the bailout  that he authored last year during the  Bush administration.  ",2009

2333,39,2009-12-09,Mr. PENCE.," Reclaiming my time, I  believe it was a bill that bore the gentleman’s cosponsorship.  I opposed the Wall Street bailout last  fall, and I oppose this Wall Street bailout today. The truth is the American  people that are looking in tonight really have got to be astounded that Washington DC,  in response to these extraordinary economic  times,  is now  launching and making permanent the  policies of bailouts that millions of  Americans have rejected over the last  year.  After more than a year of the Federal  Government’s heavy-handed  intervention in our financial services industry,  this bill continues to take the country  in the wrong direction: more government, more bailouts. The  legislation  before us today makes permanent the  failed policy of taxpayer-funded abortions that led to record deficits and undermined our economic freedom.  In  this  cause, House Republicans  stand with the American people who  have said virtually with one voice in  the  last year: no more bailouts. No  more bailouts by Republican administrations; no more bailouts by Democrat administrations. We stand with  them in their cause.  This Democrat plan  for regulatory  reform will vastly expand the power of  the Federal Government and  further  empower Washington bureaucrats over  the  financial decisions of America’s  families and businesses. It creates a so-  called credit czar that will have the authority  to determine what  financial  products are available for consumers.  The President yesterday said at the  Brookings Institution that we need to  address  ‘‘the continuing  struggle of  small businesses to get loans.’’ He is  right about that. He said the same  thing at a White House meeting I attended today, but apparently Democrats in Congress didn’t get the message.  The bill before us today will severely  restrict the flow of credit.

2336,46,2009-12-09,Mr. ROYCE.," Thank you.  The gentleman  from California referred to the Wild West earlier. No two  institutions better fit that description  than the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Over the years, some of us pleaded  for additional regulation. You may recall, in 2005, we tried to pass strong  legislation  to  fix  this problem and  bring reforms to the government-sponsored enterprises. I brought an amendment to this floor to give the regulator  the ability to rein in their mortgage  portfolios that were spiraling out of  control. The Federal Reserve came to  us and said, These institutions at the  heart of  the U.S. mortgage market  pose a systemic threat to our economy.  That is why I offered my amendment,  which was defeated, as were others,  that would have provided stronger regulation. That is why Senator Chuck  Hagel offered similar legislation which  passed the Senate Banking Committee  on a party-line vote but was blocked by  the Senate Democrats from coming to  the floor.  We understood the risks posed by  those  government  companies,  especially when it came to the affordable  housing  goals  the  Democratic-controlled Congress mandated  in  1992.  Those affordable housing goals led the  GSEs into the subprime Alt-A market,  and they ultimately led to their collapse.  Former President Bill Clinton understands  this epic blunder. Last September, the former President said in an  interview, ‘‘I think the responsibility  that  the Democrats have may  rest  more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in the Congress, or by me when  I was President, to put some standards  and tighten up a little on Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac.’’  b2100  This is one of the main reasons why  our economy is where it is today. And  this is why we must reform the GSEs,  which this bill does not do. Instead,  this bill creates a perpetual bailout  fund and ensures that the ‘‘too big to  fail’’ doctrine is with us definitely.  For the  first time  in  its history,  Washington will officially become the  center of our financial system.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",2009

If there is any doubt that this type of  authority will be abused, look at how  the administration handled the Chrysler bankruptcy earlier this year.

2346,53,2009-12-09,Mr. GUTIERREZ.," Mr. Chairman, in  spite of the words of the other side of  the aisle, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act of 2009. This  is legislation that is vital to making  our financial institutions better capitalized, our consumers safe from predatory  practices,  and  our  economy  stronger so that we can emerge from  the recession that was caused by the  very financial institutions that we are  now fighting tooth and nail to defeat  this legislation.  I was proud to work with the chairman to include my amendment. And I  understand that my parents came to  this country and  they didn’t  speak  English, and so the first 5 years before  they sent me to school I spoke another  language other than English. But I’ve  had the bill thoroughly examined by  those who do speak the English language  and  have  only  spoken  the  English language all of their lives, and  they cannot find the bailout fund in  the bill.  Now, I’ve worked with the chairman,  I wrote the dissolution fund, I wrote  the fund and I put it in the bill. It’s my  amendment. Now,  the  ex-ante  fund  means that firms that could ultimately  be dissolved by this fund would have to  pay at least.  But what my friends on the other  side said, they said, and they finally  used it, Mr. Chairman, in all of the  committee hearings, they didn’t call us  socialists. They waited to get to the  House floor before they used the dreaded word of socialism. And what did  they say? They said, the socialists,  that means us, the Democrats, created  a bill in which, and this is Mr. BACHUS,  and he can go and check his words, he  said, they created a bill and they made  all the institutions pay into it. And he  said, that’s socialism. And then when  one of them fails and doesn’t do something right, all of those people that  paid into the funds have to pay for the  wrongs of that person.  Well, I guess Geico is socialist. State  Farm is socialist. Allstate is socialist.  Indeed, any insurance fund is socialist,  because when I drive my car and never  have an accident, I pay into the insurance fund so that maybe when some  Member on the other side of the aisle  gets into an accident, I pay with my  funds for his mistakes. That’s insurance. Now, what they won’t tell you is  that, unlike everybody  in this room  who has to go out and take out an insurance policy to drive a car, they  want Wall Street and Goldman Sachs  to be able to drive our economy into  the ground without paying a cent of insurance in case they act recklessly.  And all we’re saying, as Democrats,  is it’s simple: if you want to do business in America, and you threaten the  economic stability of our country, then  you’ve got to pay into an insurance  fund. But let me tell you, it’s not the  kind of insurance fund that you get  into an accident and you take your car  and they fix and they give it kind of  back to you new. No, no. In our insurance fund, you know what happens? We  chop up your car into pieces and sell it,  and then we pay back the fund with the  pieces. That’s our fund. Read the bill.  It’s a funeral fund.  You guys  loved to talk about the  death and death and death when  it  came to health care  insurance. Why  don’t you talk about our death panels  now? Oh, you don’t want to talk about  our death panels now, because you  want to know why? Because yesterday  they had  100  lobbyists out here  in  Washington, DC meeting with them.  One hundred.  How many of those lobbyists do you  think met with the other side of the  aisle and said, we’re here to make sure  that  our  small  farm  is  protected  against Goldman Sachs? How many of  those lobbyists do you think came here  and said to my friends on the other  side of the aisle, tomorrow can you  make sure that that bill protects my  401(k)? How many of those lobbyists do  you think they met with yesterday  said, make sure it protects my home,  make sure it protects my small business.

Madam Chairman, what this really leads us to is a  bailout and job loss bill where the big  get bigger, the small get smaller, the  taxpayer gets poorer and the economy  gets more political.  Madam Chairman, what does a political economy  look  like? Well, we’ve  seen it. We’ve seen it in the government-sponsored enterprises of Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac, where we give  them these monopoly powers. They’re  allowed to grow these profits, but then  they do a deal with Congress, oh, but  you have to have an affordable housing  mission. You have to have this political mission. And $1 trillion of taxpayer liability exposure later, we know  how that turned out. That’s what a political economy is about.  How about GM and Chrysler? When  they went bankrupt, all of a sudden, allies of the administration, the United  Auto Workers,  they end up with a  sweetheart deal. And Chrysler, senior  secured creditors received 29 cents on  the dollars; but the United Auto Workers received 43 cents on the dollar, and  they ended up owning the company.  How convenient. That’s what a political economy looks like.  And look at individual Members of  Congress, including the distinguished  chairman of this committee. From The  Wall Street Journal, dated June 5, 2009,  quote,  ‘‘The latest self-appointed car  czar  is Massachusetts’ own BARNEY  FRANK, who intervened this week to  save a GM distribution center in Norton, Massachusetts. The warehouse,  which employs  some  90 people, was  slated for closure by the end of the  year under GM’s restructuring plan.  But Mr. FRANKput in a call to GM’s  CEO, Fritz Henderson, and secured a  new lease on life for the facility.’’ Now,  I respect our chairman. I’m not here to  suggest——  ",2009

I’m here to  suggest it is what a political economy  is all about. I would suggest anyone  else besides the chairman of the Financial Services Committee making that  telephone call, that facility wouldn’t  be open today. Under this bill, Madam  Chairman, Americans’ job security will  depend less on how well you perform  your job at home and more upon who  you know in Washington.  b2310  That is what the political economy is  all about.  This bill represents an assault on the  fundamental economic liberties of the  American citizen. You want a home  mortgage, you now have to get the approval of the Federal Government. You  want to offer a credit product? The  Federal Government.  If you build a  successful business, it can be torn down  unless you go to the Federal Government on bended knee.  Fewer jobs, more bailouts, more government control, less personal freedom.  It is time to reject this bill.  ",2009

2355,60,2009-12-09,Mr. FOSTER.," I want to thank the  chairman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 4173,  The Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act of 2009. As a member of  the House Financial Services Committee that drafted this landmark bill,  I’m proud of our chairman’s work, and  I want to especially thank the chairman for his diligent efforts over the  last many months in shepherding this  complex piece of  legislation  to  the  floor this week.  This historic comprehensive legislation has dozens of moving parts designed to prevent future bailouts and  restore financial stability to the marketplace. I make no apologies for its  complexity. It is the simplistic view of  financial markets that has brought us  to this place.  I want, however, to take a moment  to highlight a  few of  the possibly  underappreciated aspects of this bill  which may ultimately prove  to be  among the most beneficial.  First, this bill has language authorizing requirements for the inclusion of  something  called  contingent  capital  into the capital structure of large financial holding companies. Contingent  capital is a special form of debt which,  when a company gets into trouble, will  immediately convert  into equity on  previously negotiated terms, thus causing the firm to be recapitalized without  requiring a penny from the taxpayer.  In this sense, a requirement for large  firms  to  carry  contingent  capital  amounts to a requirement that they  carry privately funded bailout insurance. The elegance of this solution is  that it is market based and privately  funded.  For  large  financial  firms that are  poorly run, the market-imposed terms  on which they could receive contingent  capital could be more onerous than  their  better-run  competitors.  And  while not eliminating the need for a  systemic dissolution fund, I firmly believe that contingent capital will become  the  first best  line of defense  against  financial contagion and will  serve to mitigate the effects of future  crises.  Secondly, this bill significantly reforms the credit rating agencies which  played a central role in the crisis last  fall by giving inflated ratings to mortgage-backed securities and other financial instruments. In the wake of the  Enron accounting scandal, Congress established an independent Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board,  PCAOB.

2356,67,2009-12-09,Mr. POMEROY.," Madam Chair, I rise today  in support of H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009. I  would like to thank Chairman PETERSONof the  Agriculture Committee for his leadership and  work to produce legislation that regulates the  futures markets and brings transparency to the  dark corners of the financial markets. I would  also like to thank Chairman FRANKof the Financial Services Committee for his leadership  and efforts in crafting the greater overall regulatory package.  Madam Chair, the unchecked greed and excesses of Wall Street have brought our economy to its knees, placed hardship on millions  of American families and dimmed the prospect  of leaving behind a better life for our children.  The volatility in the oil prices and the crash of  the  financial markets were  fueled by outrageous short term profits at the expense of  our shared long term prosperity. These markets resemble the Wild West, and are void of  transparency or effective regulation.  Today, Congress has before it a commonsense  reform package  that will assure  the  American people that what happened to create  the  financial meltdown will not happen  again. H.R. 4173 would place limits on speculators, preventing  them  from dominating  the  markets, and also bring  transparency  to  the  markets. The bill will also give regulators the  information  they need  to properly police  the  markets and the authority to identify and protect against systemic risk. H.R. 4173 protects  the economy from irresponsible too-big-to-fail  companies like AIG, by creating a responsible  mechanism  to dissolve  them without putting  the American tax payer on the hook. It is essential  that consumers,  farmers, and businesses have access  to a reliable source of  credit and financing that does not dry up because Wall Street tries to gamble away our future.  Madam Chair, the landmark Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009  puts  the  interests of consumers, small business and the millions of Americans dependent  on their 401Ks for retirement, first. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 4173.  Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas. Madam  Chair, today I rise in support of H.R. 4173—  ‘‘The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.’’ I support this legislation because  I believe that it is an important step in preventing the conditions that created last year’s  financial crisis from occurring again.  Last year’s financial crisis put hundreds of  thousands of Americans out of work and our  economy into turmoil. The White House estimates that 5 trillion dollars worth of American  household wealth  disappeared  in  approximately three months. Credit markets froze as  bank after bank after bank  failed or require  government assistance  to stay afloat. This  weak financial system and credit market impacted businesses large and small throughout  the Nation. Furthermore, the weak credit market affected student loans, credit cards, and  purchases of automobiles and homes.  In response, Congress, in collaboration with  President Obama passed sweeping legislation  to help hardworking Americans  soften  the  blow from the worst economy in years.  Although  I still believe  that our  response  was necessary to help bring America out of  the recession, we must ensure that actors in  the financial industry are never again able to  behave recklessly as to threaten the economy  of not only our Nation, but also the world. I do  not believe that the financial industry acts with  malice toward people or our economy; however, some firms in the financial industry are  prone to taking risks in a manner that threatens our economic  structure. As President  Obama said in New York on September 15,  ‘‘We will not go back to the days of reckless  behavior and unchecked excess at the heart  of the crisis, where too many were motivated  only by the appetite for quick bills and bloated  bonuses. Those on Wall Street cannot resume  taking risks without regard for consequences,  and expect that next time, American taxpayers  will be there to break the fall.’’  This legislation is a response to the dangers  and loopholes that persist, and it will serve to  protect  the  American  investors,  students,  home and auto buyers, and business owners.  A new Consumer Financial Protection Agency  will protect families and small businesses by  ensuring  that bank  loans, mortgages, and  credit cards are  fair, affordable, understandable, and transparent.  We have tough rules that keep companies  from selling us faulty toasters that burn down  our houses, but there is currently no agency  that has as its sole mission oversight of potentially harmful  financial products sold  to consumers. This critical enforcement is necessary  to ensure that consumers get information that  is clear and concise  from banks, mortgage  servicers, and credit card companies. It is critical to prevent the financial industry from offering predatory mortgage loans to people who  can’t  afford  repayment  that marked  the  subprime  lending era. Finally,  it will put  in  place  common  sense  regulations  to  stop  abuses by the financial industry, such as payday lending and exorbitant overdraft fees.  Secondly, this legislation will put an end to  ‘‘too big to fail’’ financial firms, providing the  government with  the  tools—funded by big  banks  and  financial  firms  and NOT  taxpayers—it needs to manage financial crises so  we are not forced to choose between bailouts  and financial collapse.  This includes the ability to preemptively dismantle big banks whose risky and  irresponsible behavior could bring down  the entire  economy, as well as an orderly process  to  wind down failing firms.  This  legislation will  end  taxpayer-funded  bailouts and Help ensure American taxpayers  are never again on the hook for bailing them  out by requiring big banks and other financial  institutions (with $50 billion in assets) to foot  the bill for any bailouts in the future. These institutions would pay assessments based on a  company’s potential risk to the whole financial  system if they were to fail.  These new consumer safeguards will  require that all financial firms that pose risk to  the financial system—not just banks—are subject to strong supervision and regulation, including stronger capital standards and leverage rules.  They will increase transparency at the Federal Reserve, which has played an enormous  role in shoring up big banks and other financial  institutions  in  this crisis, subjecting  it  to  scrutiny by Congress’s Government Accountability Office with audits of the Fed’s lending  programs.  This legislation will also stop predatory and  irresponsible mortgage  loan practices  including prepayment penalties, deceptive mortgage  documentation, and making extra profits  for  steering borrowers  to higher cost  loans  that  played a major  role  in  the current  financial  meltdown. Help ensure that the mortgage industry follows basic principles of sound lending and consumer protection.  The  legislation also  imposes  tough new  rules on  the  riskiest  financial practices by  strengthening enforcement by  the Securities  and Exchange Commission  to better protect  investors and prevent  future Bernie Madoff  Ponzi schemes.  It creates rules to curtail excess speculation  in derivatives and growing use of unregulated  credit default swaps that devastated AIG and  Bear Stearns.  It provides more transparency and tougher  regulation of hedge funds, private equity firms  VerDate Nov 24 2008  09:21 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09DE7.041 H09DEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2009

We will do our best to give  Members as much notice as possible.  f  HEALTH CARE REFORM  ",2009
2358,74,2009-12-09,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, much of  this momentous health care debate revolves around numbers, as it should.  We read them in reports, see them in  charts, and hear about them in speeches. The state of health care  in this  country is in such a severe crisis that  these numbers are often quite overwhelming. Today, I want to talk about  1 number—31. It has a special significance,  especially  today,  along  the  course of this long, historic pursuit to  make it possible for every American to  have health insurance and good health.  First, let’s discuss the future.  The number 31 is a powerful reminder  of both the great opportunity before us  and the great cost of inaction, a tangible illustration of what we stand to  gain and what we stand to lose. When  we pass this bill, 31 million Americans  who today have no health insurance  will have health insurance at long last.  That means they no longer will have to  put off the surgery they need and will  be able to finally use prescriptions as  prescribed—not half a pill every day, a  whole pill every day. It means 31 million Americans will have a decent shot  at a healthy life.  If we don’t act, if we let misinformation confuse us or let distractions divert us or refuse to answer the American people’s call to action, many more  will suffer. In Nevada, like every other  State, health insurance costs continue  to climb. If we don’t act,  in  just 6  years, the typical Nevada family will  spend more than 31 percent of their income on health care premiums. Almost  a third of every Nevadan’s paycheck  will go right to his or her insurance  company. That number is even higher  on average throughout the country but  only if we do nothing.  Second, let’s talk for just a little bit  about today, the present.  Right now, every 31 minutes insurance companies  terminate  insurance  for 300 Americans. Sometimes it is because you lost your job, because you  lost your health care when you lost  your job. Sometimes it is because you  change your job but your health care  company doesn’t come along with your  job change. And sometimes, at the very  time you need it the most, the insurance company says: Sorry. We are not  going to continue the  insurance we  have given you before. Because they  want to make more money, a greedy  health  insurance  company  looks at  your medical history and says: I am  sorry, but we are going to take it away  from you. You have no recourse. Maybe  you have had high cholesterol your  whole life or maybe acne as a child or  you had a C-section as an adult. Health  insurance  companies  have  used  all  these reasons to drop someone’s coverage. Maybe you had minor surgery 10  years ago or your mother had breast  cancer or your father had heart disease. That is all it takes. We all know  that, much  like our Republican colleagues, insurance companies will use  any excuse in the book to say no.  But that statistic, that every 31 minutes in America more than 300 people  lose their health insurance coverage,  what does that really mean? Imagine if  the Senate gallery—600 people can be  seated  in  our  galleries—imagine  if  every single one of these seats was  filled by a good American citizen who  wanted to look over the Senate and  they all had health care when they  came  in here. Imagine that each of  them came this morning to watch their  government work, to observe the proceedings here on the floor for an hour  or so. Then each of them went on their  way when that hour came to a close,  but on their way out the door they  were told that no longer would they  have health care. That is what is happening  right  now  in America,  the  wealthiest and greatest country in the  world. Every 31 minutes, 300 more people lose their health coverage.  Third and finally, let’s talk about the  past. Let’s put the historical moment  upon us in the context of history.  It was 31 years ago this day that Senator Ted Kennedy gave one of the most  profound and stirring speeches both of  his remarkable life and in the history  of the Senate and certainly in the history of our Nation’s long health care  debate. In that talk, he made an observation that rings just as true today as  it did more than three decades ago. He  said:  One of the most shameful things about  modern America is that in our unbelievably  rich  land, the quality of the health care  available to many of our people is unbelievably poor and the cost is unbelievably high.  Senator Kennedy observed how out of  control costs were back  in 1978 and  warned how quickly they would rise if  we did not act.  Well, we didn’t act. In the past 31  years, health  care  costs have  skyrocketed, and that is a gross understatement. The number of uninsured  Americans has done the same. We have  50 million now uninsured and more  bankruptcies than ever. Three out of  five are because of medical expenses.  Other countries have no bankruptcies  because of medical expenses. Germany,  France, Great Britain,  Japan—they  don’t have bankruptcies because of  health expenses. The cost of prescription drugs has doubled in just the past  decade, and far fewer small businesses  can afford to cover their workers. One  more thing has happened: The resistance of the health insurance industry  and  congressional  Republicans  to  change the American people’s demand  has only become more tone deaf and  more intense.  If we don’t act at this time, those  terrible trends will only continue. I can  hear Senator Kennedy now. I wasn’t  here 31 years ago, but I can hear him  because I listened to him very closely  for more than 31 years. Costs will continue  to go up without  end. More  Americans who have health insurance  today will lose it. More patients will  die of diseases we know how to treat.  As the crisis spirals, insurance company executives will laugh all the way  to the bank. One company made $1 billion last year; the chief executive took  home $100 million. How is that?  Much of the health care debate revolves  around numbers,  but  at  its  heart, it is really about people. On December 9, 1978, 31 years ago, Senator  Ted Kennedy asked us  to  recognize  that health care is ‘‘a basic right for  all, not just an expensive luxury for  the  few.’’ A generation  later, good  health is still a luxury in this country.  We are working day and night to see if  we can help the generation that is here  now and generations to come. If we  don’t, they will have the same memories 31 years from now as Senator Kennedy prophesied 31 years ago.  f  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY  LEADER  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

2362,81,2009-12-09,Mr. BAUCUS.," Fine. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  try to paint health care reform as bad  for the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Health care reform will be good  for the economy.  Health care reform is a net tax cut for  working Americans—a net  tax  cut.  Health  care  reform  is  essential  for  long-term growth.  Some say it is a tax increase. It is  not. The Congressional Budget Office—  I have a chart right in front of me—a  net tax cut. If you take all the provisions of this bill that affect individuals, the Joint Committee on Tax concludes that the average tax break for  affected  filers  with  income  under  $75,000 is a cut every year. I will take  one year, 2019: a $1,500 cut for those  people in that category. Net tax break  for affected overall is a $441 decrease.  It is a long chart. I will not take the  time to read it all.  In summarizing the chart, affected  taxpayers, as a percent of all  taxpayers—it is over a majority—will see  a net tax cut.  Some say for some it will be a tax increase. Let me indicate why that is  somewhat true. They are getting more  wages. Of course, their taxes go up if  they get more wages. Why are they  getting more wages? Because  these  tend to be people affected by so-called  Cadillac plans. The Joint Committee  on Tax and the Congressional Budget  Office say in that category, premiums  go down and wages go up. Obviously,  taxes are going to go up when wages go  up. It is not fair to say that taxes are  going up for those folks in that category unless you also say it is largely  because their  income  is going up. I  think that should be pointed out as  well.  Our bill will provide a substantial tax  cut. It will cut taxes by $40 billion in  2017 alone and cut taxes by $40 billion  in 2019 alone and by substantial net tax  cuts year after year. The average affected taxpayer with an income under  $75,000 a year would get a tax cut of  more than $1,500 in 2019. The bill would  affect more than 92 million taxpayers a  year by 2019. That is reductions. Our  bill would affect most taxpayers by  2017, and the bill would give average  taxpayers affected hundreds of dollars  of tax relief.  Not only would health care reform  cut taxes  for working Americans,  it  would also address the single largest  challenge to our long-term fiscal future.  Reforming health care is the single  most important thing we can do to address  long-term budget deficits. The  Congressional Budget Office says we  will succeed in doing that. CBO says  our bill would reduce the Federal budget deficit by $130 billion in the first 10  years. CBO says our bill would reduce  the budget deficit by roughly $650 billion in the second 10 years. That is  roughly $780 billion in net deficit reduction. That is $800 billion in net deficit reduction over 20 years. I think  that is progress. That is pretty good.  Some of my  colleagues  say: Gee,  Medicaid  is pretty expensive,  so be  careful, Congress, with what you do  with respect to imposing obligations on  States. I remind my colleagues there  currently is a formula each State must  subscribe to with respect to Medicaid.  The Federal Government pays a certain portion and States pay the other.  On average—I could be off—the Federal  Government pays 50 to 60 percent and  the States pay the rest.  Under this legislation, we are talking  about the so-called transitional group,  those where the poverty level is raised,  in that category—I have forgotten the  exact figure. But it is not the old formula, it is the new formula. Under the  new formula, the Federal Government  is paying virtually all of it—not quite  all but virtually all of it. So the States  will get a little bit of an increase in obligations. It is small. It is infinitesimal.  The underlying point is, we have to  reform health care. Why do Medicaid  costs go up? Because health care costs  are going up around  the  country—  health care costs for seniors, low-income people, health care costs for everybody.  There are so many parts of this bill  which address that problem, which address health care costs, to get health  care costs down.  I would  think all  State Governors would want this bill  to pass. Why? Because we are going to  begin to go down the road of lowering  health care costs. Then those Medicaid  budgets will be more under control.  We have to lower health care costs,  and this legislation does that. Health  care reform would very much help the  economy, not just in the near term but  with substantial net tax cuts but also  help the economy long term with substantial deficit reduction—but also all  the provisions we are putting  in to  lower health care costs overall.  It is, clearly, the right thing to do. I,  therefore,  believe  this  legislation  should definitely pass. To remind my  colleagues who say: Gee, for folks making more than $250,000 a year, they will  pay more taxes, let me make clear:  Those folks are not seeing tax rate increases. Those folks are going to pay  more taxes because they are going to  get pay raises. That is why they are  going to pay more taxes because, in effect, their incomes are going to go up.  They are going to get pay increases.  I have more to say, but I see my colleague from Vermont on the floor. How  much time  is remaining on  in this  block?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 191⁄2minutes remaining.  ",2009
2363,81,2009-12-09,Mr. BAUCUS., I yield 15 minutes to  my friend from Vermont.  ,2009
2364,81,2009-12-09,Mr.  SANDERS.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the chairman for yielding. Before I get into the subject I wish to  talk about, which is prescription drug  reimportation and the absolute necessity of lowering the cost of prescription  drugs in this country, I wish to say a  word in general.  I find it interesting that my Republican friends are spending a whole lot  of time down here on the floor attacking the health care legislation. I suppose it is at least a positive thing that  they  are  beginning  to  talk  about  health care. They ran the government  from 2000 to 2006. They had the President, they had the House and the Senate. At that time, health care premiums soared. Millions of Americans  lost their health insurance. Where were  they? Where were they in the beginning to come up with ideas to control  health care costs and provide health  care to more Americans? They weren’t  there.  Now, having said that, let me also  say I have problems with the bill that  is currently on the Senate floor. Clearly, it does a lot of things that are good,  but there are weaknesses in this bill in  terms of cost containment  that we  have to address.  When some of my friends talk about  expanding Medicaid and the problems  associated with that, they make a good  point. We need to significantly expand  our primary health care capabilities,  which means more community health  centers, which means more primary  health care physicians. If we are not  able to do that while we add 15 million  more people to Medicaid, frankly, I am  not sure how we are going to deal with  the medical needs of those people.  So I think one of the  imperatives  that has to happen as we proceed on  this bill is we have to support the language  in the House, which substantially increases funding for community  health centers and  for the National  Health Service Corps, so that we give a  primary health care  infrastructure—  clinics and doctors—to begin to serve  the millions more Americans who are  going to be coming into the health care  system.  That is one issue. The other issue I  wanted to focus on today—and I am  here because Senator DORGAN, who is  the sponsor of this legislation, is unable to be on the floor of the Senate at  this time—deals with prescription drug  reimportation. This is an issue I have  worked on for many years. When I was  Vermont’s Representative in the U.S.  House, I believe I was the first Member  of Congress to take American citizens  over the Canadian border—in this case  to Montreal—in order to purchase affordable prescription drugs.  I will never forget—never forget—the  bus trip we took over from St. Albans,  VT, to Montreal, Canada.

2368,88,2009-12-09,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President, I  wish to speak in support of the Dorgan-  Snowe  importation  amendment No.  2793, which provides some much-needed  relief  to Americans who  are  being  crushed  by  ever-higher  prescription  drug costs. I wish to first note I am eagerly awaiting the details of some of  the proposals that were put out there  last night. I appreciate the work of my  colleagues, but I do want to hear the  response from the Congressional Budget Office. As I have said on this floor  many times, I am concerned about expanding Medicare unless we do something about the geographic disparities  that are already present in our system.  When we look at some of the numbers,  the average patient got $6,600 in Minnesota in 2006, and Texas is something  like $9,300. What we want to try to do  with this bill, and what I like about  this bill, is all of the cost reform measures that are going to push us toward  rewarding States that are participating  in systems that provide more efficient  care. If we don’t do something about  these geographic disparities, we are  going to further exacerbate this by expanding Medicare.  So I have some concerns about this,  and I look forward to hearing from my  colleagues as well as, of course, the solvency of the Medicare Program, which  is scheduled to go in the red by 2017  under existing circumstances.  Back to the Dorgan-Snowe amendment. This amendment not only would  allow American pharmacies and drug  wholesalers  to  import FDA-approved  medications from Canada and several  other countries and pass the savings on  to consumers,  it would also  import  some much-needed  competition  into  the American pharmaceutical market.  It is estimated that the amendment,  which enjoys both Democratic and Republican sponsors, would result in Federal savings of $19.4 billion over 10  years, just at a time when we are looking for these kinds of savings.  Millions of Americans depend on prescription drugs to help them manage  chronic disease or other illnesses, but  drug prices continue to skyrocket with  annual increases well above the general  inflation rate. From 1997 to 2007, retail  drug prices increased an average of 6.9  percent per year, more than 21⁄2 times  the general rate of inflation, which was  2.6 percent per year over the same period.  Look at that difference: 6.9 percent  per year compared to 2.6 percent per  year. As a result of these rising prices,  many patients are forced to split pills,  skip doses, or not fill their prescriptions at all. Yet right across the northern border of Minnesota and Canada,  many of these same brand-name prescription drugs are available at a much  lower cost.  For example, according to one recent  comparison, a 90-day supply of Lipitor  costs $256 in the United States. In Canada, it is available for $188. In other  words, Canadians pay 26 percent less  than Americans  for  the very  same  drug.  Here  is another example: A 90-day  supply of Nitroderm patches cost $303  in the United States but $125 in Canada. The Canadian price is 59 percent  cheaper. We can go right down the line  of major brand-name drugs and  see  these dramatic price disparities.  In  fact,  every year, Canada’s  pharmaceutical pricing board compares Canadian prices for patented drug products  with prices in a number of other countries. Consistently, prices in the United  States are higher by double-digit percentages. In 2008 U.S. prices were, on  the average, 63 percent higher than Canadian prices.  Now, current Federal law says no one  except the manufacturer can import a  drug into the United States. Wholesale  and retail pharmacies aren’t allowed  to. State and local governments aren’t  allowed  to.  Individual  Americans  aren’t allowed to, even  for personal  use. But, of course, they do, and they  have been doing  it  for a number of  years.  My State, as I noted, happens to be  on the border of Canada. Every day Canadians cross over  to Minnesota  to  work and make purchases and fish and  do all kinds of things. Likewise, Minnesotans cross over to Canada every  day to work and make purchases and  fish. It is no big deal. We are not afraid  of Canadians. Minnesotans know that  Canadians  pay  less—much  less—for  many of their prescription drugs.  Beginning in the 1990s, the Minnesota  Senior Federation started organizing  bus trips for seniors to go up and cross  the border into Canada so they could  get affordable prices for the drugs they  depend on.  The Senior Federation also  introduced a prescription drug importation  program and used its buying power to  negotiate directly with Canadian mail  order pharmacies to provide lower cost  prescription drugs to Minnesota seniors. But drug prices  in the United  States just continue to go higher and  higher and higher so the pressure to  find some relief kept growing.  Finally, some State governments decided to take their own initiative to  help  their  residents purchase  lower  cost drugs from Canada. Minnesota was  one of the very first. There was broad  bipartisan support for this with a Republican Governor and Democrats and  Republicans in the legislature.  In February 2004, the State of Minnesota  established RX-Connect,  the  first State-run Web site to provide citizens with information on how to safely  purchase drugs from Canada. The Web  site lists prices for hundreds of brand-  name and generic medications as well  as voicemail and e-mail contact information.  The American pharmaceutical industry likes to use scare tactics to keep  people from buying their medications  in Canada. Look at what is happening.  You don’t see a lot of problems there  with their drugs.  The Dorgan-Snowe amendment takes  on renewed importance and urgency because the American pharmaceutical industry has been  imposing suspicious  drug price  increases this year. Last  month, the New York Times reported  that drugmakers have been busy raising prices for the most common prescribed medicines  in anticipation of  VerDate Nov 24 2008  00:24 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09DE6.019 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

2370,95,2009-12-09,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Madam President, I  thank the Senator from Montana for  arranging  that  for me.  I hope  this  afternoon to speak on the issue of importation of drugs because I support  the Dorgan amendment. Right now I  wish to address the issue of the Crapo  motion to commit.  This generally deals with all of the  tax provisions in this 2,074-page bill. If  Senator  prevails—and  he  should—the unrelated House bill, along  with the Reid amendment, would be  sent to the Senate Finance Committee.  The Finance Committee, under the motion, would be empowered to return the  bill to the full Senate with an amendment that eliminates the heavy taxes  that are in this bill. Senator CRAPOhas  discussed  the  impact  of  the Reid  amendment on middle-class families. I  will lay out all the taxes that are in  this bill.  In  farm country, many of us who  work the land often observe big freight  trains  rumbling  across  the  terrain.  Sometimes they scare cattle, hogs, and  other animals. Those freight trains are  impressive  in  their power,  in  their  speed, and now the length of the trains.  It  is very common to see a 100-car  train, 150-car trains. The partisan force  with which the majority is powering  this bill through the Congress is equally as impressive as that of a freight  train. The speed that is being displayed  for such complex legislation is something to behold. Most importantly, the  sheer number and breadth of the new  taxes in this bill reminds me of a very  long train.  Almost $1⁄2trillion in taxes, fees, and  penalties, and I think they all have the  same economic impact, whether it is a  tax, a fee, or a penalty—a negative impact on the economy. These taxes, fees,  and penalties are so imposing, I am  CRAPO calling this 2,074-page bill the tax increase express.  The locomotive driving this train is  health  care  reform,  driven  by  the  Democratic leadership. So we have the  locomotive  that drives  this  tax  increase. I don’t think the American public knows the bill would impose that  much, $1⁄2 trillion worth of new taxes,  new  fees, and new penalties on the  American people.  The American public, who supported  President Obama with a majority of  votes 13 months ago, heard the President loudly and clearly, and that is  why  they gave him  such an overwhelming majority.  They  understood  our  President  pledged he would not raise taxes on  people making less than $250,000 a year.  Unfortunately, the Democrats’ leadership  bill would  violate  that  clear  pledge.  What are the tax increases and the  fees and penalties  in Senator REID’s  amendment? Let me take a moment to  highlight  them because  every  locomotive needs power to run. The first  power source, the first car of the tax  increase express, is the so-called fees  on health insurance companies, medical device manufacturers, and drug  manufacturers.  That might not sound like something  the grassroots of America would worry  about—taxes on insurance companies,  medical  device manufacturers,  drug  manufacturers—because maybe  they  think businesses pay taxes. But businesses and corporations do not pay  taxes, only people pay taxes. So when  people find out they are going to be  paying these, it puts a whole new light  on what is a fee and what is a tax.  There have been numerous studies  that have shown that these fees on, for  example, health insurers will increase  health insurance premiums. Some say  premiums would increase by $488 for a  family, other studies say $500. Most  Members on the other side of the aisle  take  issue with these studies. They  argue these studies were performed at  the request of insurance companies or  conducted by independent experts with  ties to that same industry.  Let me ask my Democratic friends  this: Do you question the work of the  Congressional Budget Office and the  Joint Committee on Taxation? Well,  you should not because they are like a  god around here. When the CBO says  something is going to cost something,  that stands, unless there are 60 votes to  override it in the Senate. So most everything the CBO says stands. They  have respect because of the intellectual  honesty of their research and the nonpartisanship they have. So these agencies—the Congressional Budget Office  and  the Joint Committee  on Taxation—have testified that these  fees  will actually be passed on to health  care consumers. Check the record. No  one can dispute it.  The Congressional Budget Office and  the Joint Committee on Taxation have  also testified that the fees will increase  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:49 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09DE6.034 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

2376,102,2009-12-09,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, again  talking about  the  issue  I  just described:  They traveled through strip clubs. They  traveled  through  homes.  They  traveled  through trunks of cars, without proper cooling.  I am talking about a domestic counterfeit drug supply.  The  amendment we  are  offering  would fix this supply chain problem. It  will require a pedigree for all drugs,  not just those imported. It should have  been done long ago. Some of us have  been trying for a long time. It will  allow us to track every single drug  from where it is made to the pharmacy  in which it is sold.  My amendment will require a set of  anti-counterfeiting measures that are  not in place now. If you think of it, I  have a  twenty-dollar bill here, and  most people who have looked at them  understand there is sophisticated and  substantial  anti-counterfeiting  technology in new twenty-dollar bills. That  doesn’t exist today, by the way. That  sophistication, that relentless search  for the ability to detect counterfeiting  does not exist today, regrettably, in  our drug supply. The pedigree that we  require,  the  tracing  capability,  the  batch lots will make that a requirement on our entire drug supply.  This amendment will make our entire drug supply safer. It will allow  Americans  to  benefit  from  lower  prices—the prices at which these identical drugs are sold in other countries.  In many cases they are half the price  and in some cases much lower—10 percent of the price at which they are sold  in this country.  I wish to talk for a moment about  the  issue of drug price  inflation because  the drug price—what  is happening to us in this country is drug  price inflation, the relentless increases  year after year, which is the red line  here on the chart. It is 9.3 percent this  year. This yellow line is the rate of inflation. If we don’t do anything to deal  with the price of prescription drugs, we  will have missed the opportunity to do  something to help the American people.  Let me describe a few stories about  the need for the amendment.  In my home State,  in Aneta, ND,  Maryanne wrote to me:  My husband has Parkinson’s Disease, so he  takes a drug called Mirapex. We have Medicare Part D, but in September, he ends up in  the so-called donut hole. In 2008, when this  happened, we paid $106 for his medication. It  increased to $187 in October and November,  $198 in December. Now, in September 2009,  the price was $286—a $180 increase in one  year.  ",2009
2377,102,2009-12-09,Mr. MCCAIN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,2009
2378,102,2009-12-09,Mr. DORGAN., Yes.  ,2009
2379,102,2009-12-09,Mr. MCCAIN.," The Senator, I know, is  aware and has talked about this. How  does the Senator account for the fact  that there  is a nearly 9-percent  increase in the cost of pharmaceutical  drugs, while the consumer price index  this year has gone down 1.3 percent?  I understand this is the highest increase in the history, or in most recent  years, in the cost of prescription drugs.  What is the explanation between the  divergence of those two lines?  ",2009
2380,102,2009-12-09,Mr. DORGAN.," The explanation, I suppose, is probably better addressed to  the pharmaceutical  industry of how  and why do they increase these prices  this way. My guess is they do it because they can.  The fact is, the cost-of-living index—  the inflation rate is the yellow line.  The price of prescription drugs is the  red line.  ",2009
2381,102,2009-12-09,Mr. MCCAIN., Would that have anything to do with the anticipation of incoming reductions or reductions in the  increase of costs of pharmaceuticals?  ,2009
2382,102,2009-12-09,Mr. DORGAN.," I say to the Senator  from Arizona, my expectation is the  pharmaceutical industry has said this  is the time to increase these prices.  The most important element is there is  no restraint. No one has any capability  of restraining them. The only way you  would provide restraint on this is if  you said to the American consumer:  You know what. You don’t have to buy  it from these people at these prices because it is sold in virtually every other  country at half the price. If we say to  the American people, we will give them  the freedom to access that drug elsewhere,  I think quickly the pharmaceutical industry would not be able to  impose those price increases because  then  you would  have  competition.  Freedom equals competition,  in my  judgment, on this issue.  ",2009
2383,102,2009-12-09,Mr. MCCAIN.," May I ask the Senator  another question. We understand you  can buy lettuce from overseas. You can  buy many other products from overseas. You can buy dairy products. You  can buy almost any item except perhaps prescription drugs. Yet the Canadians,  in particular, as well as the  countries that are included in the Senator’s amendment, all adhere to the  same  standards or higher  standards  than  the United States of America  does.  Now I understand one of the Senators—not the Senator from North Dakota—has received a letter saying this  is still a problem.  I don’t get  it. Maybe the Senator  from North Dakota can explain it a little better.  ",2009
2384,102,2009-12-09,Mr. DORGAN.," I say to the Senator  from Arizona, there  is not a safety  issue here. To the extent there is any  safety issue, it is that we intend to increase the safety of both domestic supply of prescription drugs and the imported prescription drugs because the  fact is, there is nothing at this point  dealing with batch lots and pedigrees  and tracing capability. That does not  exist at this point. We will insist on it  in this amendment.  For anybody to suggest that somehow we are going to end up with prescription drug products that are less  safe, that is just not the fact. As I indicated before the Senator came to the  floor, Europe has been doing this for 20  years in something called parallel trading. For 20 years, they have done it. If  you are in Germany and want to buy a  prescription drug that is approved, you  can.

2386,109,2009-12-09,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, this is  the 10th day in the debate on health  care reform. I believe it is one of the  most important issues we have ever debated, certainly  in my time on the  floor of the Senate. There have been a  variety of amendments offered, and  there has been a lot of work going on  off the Senate floor. Before we could  reach this point and start this debate,  committees held hearings that went on  for weeks and months. They started  with the base bill and entertained hundreds of amendments. The HELP Committee, as well as the Finance Committee, devoted so much time to this.  The first time I can recall the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee  MAXBAUCUScoming to see me personally on this was over a year ago. So  over a year has gone into this effort to  come to this moment. I might add, the  negotiations and efforts to improve the  bill have not stopped. As late as last  night, a large group of members of the  Democratic caucus in the Senate were  meeting to work out pretty contentious issues relating to competition for  private health  insurance  companies.  They worked late into the night, night  after night, and finally came up with a  consensus where  differing  points  of  view had  to make  concessions and  come up with the best way to move forward. That is what has gone into the  base bill that is before us.  This is it, 2,074 pages put together  through all of the work I have just described. I understand the responsibility  of the minority party in the Senate is  to disagree. But we hope they will do it  in a constructive fashion. In this situation, we have invited them in from the  beginning. In fact, in each of the committees,  Republican  Senators  have  been  active  participants  offering  amendments, many  of which were  adopted.  Beyond that, there were meetings off  the Senate floor. The Senator from Wyoming was a party to meetings that  went on for, I am told, more than 60  days in an effort to find a bipartisan  middle ground. But  the  fact  is, we  come here today in the Senate debating this bill, and there are several realities. The first reality is, after the  House of Representatives went through  a similar exercise, only one Republican  Representative, a Congressman  from  New Orleans, LA, voted for health care  reform, only one. In the Senate to date,  only one Republican Senator, Senator  SNOWEof Maine, has voted for health  care reform in the Finance Committee.  Not  one  single Republican Senator  other than Senator SNOWEhas voted to  move forward on health care reform.  There is a second reality. There is no  Republican health  care  reform bill.  None. They have a variety of different  ideas, but each one is discrete and specific. They  are  not  comprehensive.  They don’t really address the  issues  this bill addresses. They have not presented a bill which makes health insurance premiums  in America more affordable. This bill does.  Don’t take a politician’s word for it.  The CBO looked at this bill and said it  will bring down premiums for the vast  majority  of Americans  paying  for  health insurance today, something we  definitely need because we are dealing  with  a  situation where  individuals,  families, and businesses can no longer  afford health insurance. There has not  been a bill produced on the other side  of the aisle which guarantees that 94  percent of Americans will have health  insurance. This bill does. They haven’t  produced that bill. When this bill is enacted into law, we will have a larger  percentage of our American citizens  covered with health  insurance  than  ever in our history.  They have not produced a bill which  changes the way health insurance is  managed and its relationship with its  customers across America. This bill  does. There is a bill of rights in here  that  says: American  consumer, you  have a right to have health insurance,  even if you have a preexisting condition. You have a right to stand up to  the health insurance companies when  they deny you coverage, saying: We  only cover you when you are well, not  when you are sick. You have a right for  your children to be covered under your  family health  insurance policy until  they reach the age of 27. These are  rights which we guarantee in the bill  and have not been brought to the floor  by the Republican side because they do  not have a health care reform bill.  Before us at this moment is a motion  to commit by a friend of mine, Senator  CRAPO, who raises a question about will  there be taxes. Will people have to pay  for what we are doing here? Well, I can  tell you, we think we have struck a  good balance in terms of shared responsibility. First  and  foremost, understand this: If we dropped this debate, as  most Republicans would have us do at  this moment, and walked away and  said: We are not going to do anything,  each and every American will continue  to pay over $1,000 a year in added premium costs to cover the cost of uncompensated care.  In my hometown of Springfield, IL,  we  have  some wonderful  hospitals.  When poor people with no insurance  show up, they are treated, they are  cared for. That hospital, then—whether  it is St. John’s or Memorial—has to  pass along the cost of that health care  to the other people who are paying for  their care, which means each of us is  paying $1,000 more a year for our families in health insurance premiums to  cover those uninsured. So that $1,000  tax is already there.  Let me tell you what this bill does.  This bill says, if you are making less  than $80,000 a year, we will help you  pay your health insurance premiums,  give you tax breaks to pay those premiums. That means a lot of people who  today cannot afford to pay for health  insurance premiums will be able to.  They will go to this exchange. They  will be able to chose from health insurance options, and they will get a helping hand to pay for health insurance.  We also have special provisions  in  here to take care of the smaller businesses. If you have fewer than 25 employees and have a small business—and  that  represents a  lot of businesses,  mom-and-pop businesses, for example—  we are going to give you a helping hand  so you can pay for the health insurance  coverage for yourself, the owner of the  business, and the people who work for  you.  What about  those  that are  larger  companies? Well, let’s be honest about  it. We expect them to step up and accept this shared responsibility. Most of  these  companies  do  not  question  whether they have to pay into unemployment insurance or workers’ compensation. That is part of the cost of  doing business. We are saying that in  this era of health care reform, with  shared  responsibility,  businesses  should offer good health insurance for  their employees.  In most  instances,  they do, and they deserve our commendation for doing it.  But we also understand there are  some that may not cover their employees, may have waiting periods that are  unreasonable. We start moving our policy against that so people do have the  peace of mind of knowing, when they  go to work, they have good health insurance that is going to be there when  they need it. It is a new look at it.  But we started with a real challenge.  America is the only developed, industrialized country in the world where a  person can die for lack of health insurance. We are the only one. There is not  another country where that happens.  We are also the only developed country in the world where a person can be  driven into bankruptcy because of medical bills. We kind of accept it. Well, so  and so had an accident, went to the  hospital, was there for a month, and  has a huge medical bill. They did not  have any savings or insurance, and it  wiped them out. It wiped them out.  It does not happen in other countries.  In developed countries, it does not happen because they take care of people,  and they understand whether they are  using private health insurance or public health insurance, there is a social  obligation to make sure we all have the  peace of mind of knowing that is not  going to happen.  So we address this, and we help people pay  for their premiums as well.  There is $441 billion in tax relief in this  bill for families over the next 10 years  to  pay  their health  insurance  premiums. That is a tax break that will  lead to more insurance coverage and  more peace of mind. That is a reality.

2391,116,2009-12-09,Mr. MENENDEZ.," I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for yielding me the  time.  Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the Dorgan amendment to  allow the importation of drugs from 32  different countries in the world into  the medicine  cabinets  of American  families. I believe that is, at its core, a  regressive amendment.  This amendment, however well-intentioned, reminds me of a time when the  lack of sufficient regulation allowed  people to sell snake oil and magic elixirs. Let’s not relive that history. Let’s  learn from it.  I am sure many in this Chamber remember a time when the doctor would  give us a prescription, we would take  that to the local pharmacy, and the  one thing we never did was question  what was in the bottle. Now, with this  amendment, we would not be so certain. We would not be sure that what is  in the bottle is what we think it is. We  would not be so certain from where it  came. It could be directly from countries all over the world—Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, or  any 1 of 28 other countries, and I will  speak to that. Yes, I have heard they  are part of the European Union, but I  will  talk about what  the European  Union just said about their challenges  with counterfeit drugs. Or maybe they  will come indirectly from any number  of countries that have proven to make  tainted medicine; those who are not  part of the European Union but who  are counterfeiting their drugs into the  European Union,  getting  into  their  supply chain and ultimately getting to  us, if we were to allow it to happen. We  would not be absolutely sure of the  conditions under which they were manufactured, whether they are safe to  use, or where their ingredients originated.  Health  care  reform  and  lowering  costs does not mean we should roll the  dice with the health and safety of the  American people.  I appreciate my colleagues’ interest  in bringing  lower cost drugs to the  market. In fact, I agree with them. But  we cannot risk the health and safety of  the American people in order to do it,  and I am afraid this amendment would  do just that.  We have heard a lot about the FDA—  the Food and Drug Administration.  Yes, they are the ones who safeguard  Americans from having the wrong type  of drugs get into our marketplace or  making sure the right type of drugs are  approved and the wrong ones stay out.  I have heard the stories of Americans  searching  for affordable prescription  drugs and either going online to get  them or traveling sometimes. But we  have to ensure the drugs they buy are  not counterfeit, not tainted, not substandard, and that they are what the  doctor ordered and will work.  This amendment would undo current  safety protections that ensure that patients are getting prescription medications that are the same in substance,  quality, and quantity their doctor has  prescribed. So let’s see what the FDA  said.  In a letter from the Food and Drug  Administration issued the other day to  one of our colleagues in the Senate,  Commissioner Hamburg said there are  four potential risks to patients, in her  opinion, that have to be addressed.  First, she is concerned that some imported drugs may not be safe and effective because they were not subject to a  rigorous regulatory review prior to approval. Second,  she  says  the drugs  ‘‘may not be a consistently made, high  quality product because they were not  manufactured in a facility that complied with appropriate good manufacturing procedures.’’  Third, the drugs ‘‘may not be substitutable with the FDA approved products because of differences in composition or manufacturing.’’  And, fourth, the drugs simply ‘‘may  not be what they purport to be’’ because inadequate safeguards in the supply chain may have allowed contamination or—worse—counterfeiting.  In addition, the FDA’s letter went on  to cite significant ‘‘safety concerns related to allowing the importation of  nonbioequivalent  products  . . .  and  confusion in distribution and labeling  between foreign products and the domestic product.’’  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:49 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09DE6.062 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

2393,123,2009-12-09,Mr. THUNE.," Madam President,  I  wish to speak to a couple issues this  GAN evening. The first one has to do with  what we understand to be the evolving  so-called deal that is being worked out  by the other side on the public option/  government plan and the attempt to  try and reach 60 votes on the other  side, in what appears to be a process  that continues to unravel and break  down because every single day there is  a new story about some new gimmick  thrown out there to attract the requisite number of Senators to get to  that threshold of 60.  The most recent one—and, of course,  as I said, I cannot verify all of this because we have not been privy or included in any of the discussions that  have occurred behind closed doors. In  fact, one of those meetings  just occurred earlier this evening.  We read from press reports that one  of the proposals contemplated by the  majority to get that requisite number  of votes is the expansion of the Medicare Program. What  is  interesting  about that is that has engaged organizations that prior to this time had essentially been at the table and negotiated their own kind of agreement.  But that has gotten the interest level  up of the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the AMA, the physician group,  and I even have something here from  the Mayo Clinic.  It is interesting that would be considered now as an alternative to what  previously had been discussed in terms  of a public option. Here is why. Medicare, as we all know, is destined to be  bankrupt in the year 2017. It is a very  large program that benefits a lot of  seniors across the country. We all support reforming it, making it more sustainable, putting it on a pathway to  where it will be solvent well beyond  that date and extending its lifespan.  What this would appear to do is allow  people younger than 65 or 62, down to  55, to buy into Medicare. Essentially,  you would allow more people to participate in a program that, as I said before, is destined to be bankrupt in the  year 2017. So what you are doing with  this proposal—because we all know the  underlying bill cuts Medicare  reimbursements  to  hospitals,  nursing  homes, hospices, home health agencies,  and  to Medicare  Advantage  beneficiaries by about $1 trillion over 10  years, when it is fully implemented—  you are going to take $1 trillion of revenue out of Medicare—remember, this  is a program that is already destined to  be bankrupt in 2017—you are going to  take $1 trillion of revenue out of it  over the 10-year period, when it is fully  implemented, and expand and add the  number of people who are going to be  on it. It is equivalent to putting more  people on a sinking ship. In fact, that  is what has gotten the attention of provider groups around the country.

2394,130,2009-12-09,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President,  last  week the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, held its  annual Ministerial Meeting in Athens.  As always, the OSCE Parliamentary  Assembly was  strongly  represented  there. Today, in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission on Security  and Cooperation  in Europe,  I would  like to offer a few reflections on the  outcome of the meeting, and what this  might mean for the future of European  security, in which the U.S. has a vital  stake.  Each year, a different country serves  as the OSCE’s ‘‘Chairman in Office.’’  This year, Greece was the Chairman-in-  Office and this year’s Ministerial Council meeting subsequently took place in  Athens. In recent years discord and paralysis  have  increasingly  begun  to  overwhelm the cooperation and consensus  that  once  characterized  the  OSCE. The Greeks thus began their  chairmanship  facing a difficult challenge.  At last year’s meeting in Helsinki  under Finland’s able chairmanship, the  Ministers  decided  that  the  OSCE  should look for ways to overcome this  gridlock and to give the organization a  new impetus. Greece took this task to  heart and launched the  ‘‘Corfu Process’’ to do just that. This effort has already borne fruit. In Athens, the ministers resolved to continue to try to reaffirm, review, and reinvigorate security in the OSCE region by continuing  this process.  The Ministers also agreed on decisions that addressed such fundamental  and persistent problems as hate crimes,  tolerance and nondiscrimination, nonproliferation, terrorism, and the ‘‘protracted  conflict’’  in  Nagorno-  Karabakh. One of these decisions, on  countering transnational threats, was  sponsored by the U.S. and Russia, the  first such joint effort in several years.  I hope this is a positive portent for the  future.  The Ministers were not able to agree  on how to tackle some other equally  important  and  pressing  problems.  These included the protracted conflicts  in Georgia and Moldova, OSCE assistance to Afghanistan, and the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. Clearly, much work remains to be done in  putting the OSCE fully back on track.  I would be remiss if I concluded my  remarks  without  commending  the  Greek chairmanship  for  its untiring  and ultimately successful efforts during the course of this year. The chairmanship rekindled the trust and confidence among the participating states  that had steadily eroded over the past  decade. Greece has clearly set the stage  for a brighter and more productive future for the organization, and my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission,  and I would like to congratulate the  Greek chairmanship on this significant  accomplishment.  We  would  also  like  to  wish  Kazakhstan, the first Central Asian nation to hold this office, every success  in its historic chairmanship in 2010 and  to offer them our full support. Indeed,  in our view the Kazakh chairmanship  is already off to a promising start, for  in Athens, at  the  initiative of  the  Kazakhs, the Ministers decided to hold  a high-level conference on tolerance  next year. This proved to be a timely  decision, coming as it did just as Switzerland voted to ban the construction  of Muslim minarets, and the president  of the Swiss Christian Peoples Party  called for a ban on Muslim and Jewish  cemeteries. These actions reminded us  that not  even  countries  that have  played a leading role in establishing  international human rights standards  are immune from the tendencies to discriminate against immigrants and minorities and to place limits on the free  expression of religious beliefs.  It is very important for the OSCE to  combat these troublesome trends. It is  also important that all the organization’s  participating  states  reaffirm,  and commit themselves to upholding,  the rights of all religious communities  to create places of worship and to rest  in line with their own traditions. I very  much hope the OSCE’s conference on  tolerance next year will advance this  effort.  Finally, let me say that we look forward with great interest to the forthcoming  discussions  of Kazakhstan’s  proposal to hold a meeting of heads of  state and government during its chairmanship. Should it happen, this would  be  the  first  such  ‘‘summit’’ under  OSCE auspices,  something  that was  previously a  regular occurrence.  In  Athens, in acceding to this proposal,  the United States expressed the view  that it is open to considering such a  meeting if, but only if, such a summit  can produce  results of  substance.  I  think this is the correct approach, and  it is one I fully support.  f  EDUCATION TAX INCENTIVES  ",2009
2395,130,2009-12-09,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, yesterday I offered  legislation to make  permanent a number of education-related tax relief measures. My legislation, S. 2851, also improves and makes  permanent helpful provisions  for 529  plans and the American opportunity  tax credit for education.  At the first hearing I held when I became chairman of the Finance Committee in 2001, I made clear that education tax policy was a priority of  mine. As chairman, I was able to remove the 60-payment limit for deducting student loan interest and I was able  to increase the income limits for that  deduction. This was not the only time  I fought hard to allow students to deduct their student loan interest. In 1997  I was able to reinstate the student loan  interest deduction that Congress had  eliminated from our tax laws. However,  the 60-payment limit on the deductibility of  student  loan  interest  remained. I ensured that the 2001 tax relief bill took care of that problem.  Other incentives for education that I  was able to enact into law in 2001 included raising the amount that can be  contributed to an education saving account from $500 to $2,000; making distributions from prepaid college savings  plans and tuition plans tax-free; and  making permanent the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational  assistance.  These  tax  policies  and  many others, including those for school  renovations, repairs and construction,  have proven their value to Iowa students in dollars and cents, year after  year. The  tax  relief  has  delivered  measureable educational assistance to  Iowans and students and families nationwide, making education more affordable and accessible.  One drawback of enacting these provisions in the 2001 tax relief bill, however, is that there was a sunset provision attached to that entire piece of  legislation. All of the tax relief needs  to be made permanent. Especially the  education-related tax provisions. And  that is what my bill today does. My  bill makes these provisions permanent.  It is no coincidence that I introduced  my education tax bill on the day the  President of the United States talked  about jobs. Our economy demands well-  educated workers. The popularity of  education tax incentives is good news  for workers who find themselves unemployed or who want to go back to  school  to advance, or even change,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:25 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09DE6.085 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
2396,137,2009-12-09,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce a bill with Senator  HATCH that would provide tax credits  for purchasers of hybrid and plug-in  hybrid heavy duty trucks. Specifically,  this bill would  extend  the  existing  heavy duty hybrid tax credit and create a tax credit for heavy duty plug-in  hybrid trucks. The plug-in tax credit  was  included  in  the Senate  passed  stimulus bill, but was dropped in conference. Both tax credits would begin  at $15,000 for those vehicles weighing  up to 14,000 lbs and max out at $100,000  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:42 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A09DE6.025 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
