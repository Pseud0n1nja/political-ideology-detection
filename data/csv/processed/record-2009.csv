0,House,111,0.402,2,2009-01-07,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to honor a brave American  soldier who sacrificed his life for freedom, Sergeant John Penich.  Sergeant Penich, by all accounts,  was an  extraordinary  solider whose  hard work and determination earned  him the title of Soldier of the Year in  2007 for his brigade. His bravery was  evident in combat on several occasions.  Brigadier General Perry Wiggins has  said he knows of three separate  instances when Sergeant Penich saved  the lives of his comrades.  According to newspaper reports, one  of his final acts of bravery came on  September 6, 2008, when his patrol was  attacked by rocket-propelled grenades  and  small-arms  fire. He  showed his  courage under fire, taking charge and  reestablishing security and saving the  lives  of  his  platoon members. His  heroics on that day earned him a Silver  Star, the third highest honor given to  members of  the armed  services  for  valor.  Five and a half weeks after he earned  the Silver Star, he gave the ultimate  sacrifice. Sergeant Penich put himself  in harm’s way to make the world a better place.  His commitment to this country is  second to none. He wanted to be an officer, and there’s no doubt we would  have benefited from this young man’s  tremendous leadership abilities.  Sergeant  John Penich  is  a  true  American hero.  I ask that my colleagues keep his family and friends in  their thoughts and prayers during this  very difficult time.  f  CONGRESS MUST WORK TO SAVE  AND  CREATE  JOBS  DURING  THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend her remarks.)

1,House,111,0.547,2,2009-01-07,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.,"  Madam Speaker, this year we should  work immediately to address the challenges facing our Nation. Recent job  losses and a decline  in the housing  market have led many Americans to  lose confidence in our economy. I am  optimistic, however, that sound bipartisan solutions that support small businesses and provide tax relief to American families will mean a quicker recovery and less of a burden on future  generations of taxpayers.  As we expand opportunities for job  creation, Congress should promote an  all-of-the-above  energy  strategy. We  cannot sustain our expensive and strategically dangerous dependence on foreign oil.  While  there  remain  enemies who  threaten our freedoms, I am grateful  that our fighting men and women remain committed  to  their duty. We  must defeat terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. We  must always honor our military and  veterans.  I am confident that we will lead our  Nation toward greater prosperity and  security if we trust and invest in the  ingenuity and spirit of the American  people with limited government.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th.  f  ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN  INVESTS IN AMERICA’S FUTURE  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
2,House,111,-0.402,2,2009-01-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, at a  time of great economic anxiety, this  new Congress  faces  enormous  challenges. In the next 6 weeks we’re going  to craft and hopefully pass an economic recovery package that will create and save millions of jobs and will  help jump start our economy with investments in some of our Nation’s top  priorities.  At a time when millions of Americans are losing their health insurance,  Washington needs to provide critical  assistance to States so that they can  continue to provide health care services through Medicaid. If Congress does  not act, States will have no other  choice  than  to begin dropping coverage. That  is an  immediate health  care concern that we should deal with  as part of any economic stimulus package.  But we also have an opportunity to  modernize our health care system with  new  computer  technology  that will  greatly reduce health care costs and  will improve care for every American.  Madam Speaker, I look forward to  working with all of my colleagues in  crafting a bipartisan plan that will  help rebuild our economy so that we  can get people back to work.  f  SELF DEFENSE AGAINST  RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

It has begun once more firing  thousands of Iranian-made rockets into  Israel. Numerous Israelis have died in  the last 11 days.  Hamas wants to annihilate Israel because, well, they’re Jews. Hamas kills  people that aren’t radical Muslims like  themselves. That’s why they’re called  terrorists.  Hamas cowardly hides among civilians for cover, fires rockets, then is indignant  if  Israel defends  itself. But  Israel has moved  into Gaza to  find  these bad guys.  Some world  leaders,  rather  than  mounting pressure on Hamas to stop  the rocket attacks, are calling for a  ceasefire, even a unilateral withdrawal  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:33 Jan 08, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07JA7.003 H07JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

6,House,111,-0.473,9,2009-01-07,Mr. WAXMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank  Representative TOWNS for bringing this bill to  the floor today. H.R. 36, the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act has a simple purpose. It requires that the organizations created  to raise money  for presidential  libraries and  their affiliated institutions disclose information  about their donors.  The lack of any such requirement creates  opportunities  for abuse. Under current  law,  anybody can give to these organizations anonymously, even while the President is still in office. These donations could be used to influence  presidential  decision-making with  no  public disclosure.  This is not the first time this bill has come  before  the House.  In 2001, Representative  DUNCAN introduced similar legislation. I thank  him for his early leadership on this issue. And  in 2007,  I  introduced H.R. 1254 with Representatives  CLAY,  and  EMANUEL. That bill passed the House with an  overwhelming majority in the last Congress. I  urge my colleagues once again to support this  straightforward legislation.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, today,  the House considers the Presidential Libraries  Donation Reform Act.  I was a cosponsor of  this bill when  it was originally  introduced  in  2007 and I am proud to stand in support of it  today.  Under current  law, a sitting president can  accept private donations in unlimited amounts  for  the purpose of building a presidential  library. There is no requirement that the donor’s  identity or the amount of the donation be disclosed. The potential for abuse here is obvious.  This bill requires presidential libraries fundraising organizations to disclose to Congress  information about the donors and their donations during and  immediately  following  the  president’s term in office.  The bill originally passed the House on suspension  in March 2007, and  returns  to  the  House floor today after receiving strong support in the Senate.  I encourage my colleagues  to  join me  in  supporting  this  important piece of bipartisan  legislation.  Ms.  JACKSON-LEE  of  Texas. Madam  Speaker, I thank Congressman TOWNS for attempting to bring greater transparency to presidential library fundraising efforts with H.R. 36,  the ‘‘Presidential Library Donation Reform Act  of 2009.’’  We are facing a new day, with a new administration, and a new Democratic majority.  That is why it is important that we stay true to  our core values of  fairness,  transparency, a  accountability.  Starting with the lobbying and ethics reform,  we as a body understand that a responsible  government allows for openness. This legislation continues  to  rebuild our  trust with  the  American people.  This  legislation requires  in part  that,  ‘‘any  Presidential  library  fundraising  organization  shall submit on a quarterly basis with respect  to every contributor who gave the organization  a contribution or contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) totaling $200 or more for the  quarterly period.’’  Under current law, private organizations established for the purpose of building a presidential library can raise unlimited amounts of  money  from undisclosed donors while  the  President remains  in office.  It  takes nothing  more than common sense to see the potential  for abuse in this area and the need for basic  reform.  Presidential libraries serve an important purpose as depositories of presidential papers  and centers  for historical research.  In 1939,  President Franklin Roosevelt came up with the  idea of a privately-built, but  federally maintained library to house his presidential papers.  This split of  responsibilities between  the  public and the private sectors has continued  and has since been codified into law. In 1955,  the Presidential Libraries Act  formally established a system under which federally maintained  libraries would be built using  funds  raised by private organizations. More recent  amendments have required these private organizations  to provide an operating endowment  to  the National Archives  in addition  to  the library building.  Just  as  the  funding  requirements  have  grown, so have the libraries and their affiliated  institutions. Now  these  libraries are much  more  than basic research  facilities. They  include museums and conference centers along  with other tourist attractions; they are getting  more costly all the time.  The George H.W. Bush library was reported  to cost more  than $80 million  to build. The  Clinton library and museum cost about $165  million to build. News reports have indicated  that the fundraising goal for President Bush’s  library is $500 million—half a billion dollars—  before this institution is completed.  The vast scale of these secret fundraising  efforts creates opportunities for abuse. Donors  who do not need to be identified can give unlimited amounts of money to support these libraries while the President remains in office.  This  legislation would  require  that presidential  libraries disclose  the  identity of  their  donors to Congress and the National Archives  during their period of most intense fundraising,  which is while the President is in office and in  the several years after the end of his term.  This legislation is but one part of a larger effort by this Congress to restore honesty and  accountability in the Federal Government.  CONCLUSION  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman  TOWNSand the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform  for helping us build a  strong  foundation of  trust with  the American  people. I ask my colleagues to support me in  supporting H.R. 36.  ",2009
7,House,111,-0.409,16,2009-01-07,Mr. KENNEDY.,"  Today,  Madam  Speaker, I join my colleague Congressman LANGEVIN in this tribute to Senator Pell, the great statesman  from  Rhode Island. His name is well-known  throughout  this  country,  associated  most notably with the Pell Grant, the  grant that allows millions of young  people in this country opportunity to  get a higher education.  But Madam Speaker, we wanted to  pay tribute to Senator Pell not only  for what he did to open the doors for  millions in this country for economic  and educational opportunity, we wanted to pay tribute to him for all that  he’s done as a five-term Senator from  Rhode Island and one of the most distinguished Senators ever to serve not  only Rhode Island but this country.  He was the author of the Humanities  Act, National Endowment for the Humanities, which allows the arts to be  accessible  to  the average person as  well.  He was really the founder and the  person who really began the belief that  we ought to work cooperatively around  the world in terms of foreign policy. As  the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee, he was the one who led in  diplomacy.  And my friends, he was far ahead of  his  time as an environmentalist as  well.  Madam Speaker, we could talk about  his policies and what they meant to  our country, but to know him as a person is to really say the most about  Senator Pell. He was the most self-effacing, genteel, kind-hearted man that  you could ever know. And in a world of  rough-and-tumble politics, it’s hard to  find a genuine person such as that. And  for that reason, on a personal level I  was honored to know him and serve  with him and today join my colleague,  in paying  tribute  to  LANGEVIN,  JIM him.  Senator Pell left an extraordinary legacy that  is appreciated by so many people around the  world.  He spent his life in service to our country  from his start in 1960 as a U.S. Senator from  Rhode Island to his retirement in 1997, and in  the years beyond in which he remained active  in our State.  Our Nation has lost one of its most visionary  and thoughtful legislative leaders, and his hallmark, the Pell Grant, exemplifies his efforts to  promote  education  and  opportunity  for  all  Americans. So many  families,  though  they  may not know his name, were touched by the  work and generous spirit of Senator Pell.  There are so many areas in which he led  our country to the forefront such as oceanography,  foreign policy, and college  tuition assistance. His commitment  to public service  and his notable contributions to Rhode Island  and our Nation continue to inspire people of  all generations.  The magnitude and depth of his accomplishments may never be known because he  let  others take the credit and acclaim. His style  was understated yet magnanimous and his  work ushered in many essential policies that  have shaped our world today.  Earlier  this week, President Clinton, Vice  President-elect Biden, Senator KENNEDY, Senator REEDand many of his other friends from  around the globe paid tribute to his work and  celebrated his life.  He will be truly missed and my sympathies  and prayers are with his family. He leaves behind his wife of 64 years, wonderful Nuala  O’Donnell Pell; his son, Christopher T.H. Pell,  of Newport; a daughter, Dallas Pell, of New  York City; as well as five grandchildren and  five great grandchildren.  But those of us who will miss him extends  much farther. It is our country’s sorrow to lose  such a giant of the Senate and the Nation.  And with that, I would like to yield  the floor to my colleague and friend  from  the Second Congressional District, Congressman LANGEVIN.  ",2009
8,House,111,-0.376,16,2009-01-07,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Madam Speaker, I  thank my colleague for yielding, and I  am honored to join with him today in  paying tribute to our State’s former  senior Senator, Senator Claiborne Pell,  who passed away on the 1st of this  year. He was an incredible public servant, and someone who I was proud to  call a friend and a mentor. He was one  of Rhode Island’s greatest statesmen  and gentlemen, as I said, who passed  away on the first day of 2009.  Born on November 22, 1918  into a  prominent and wealthy family, Senator  Pell was better known as a champion  for the common man and also the ‘‘Father of the Pell Grant Program.’’ After  receiving a degree from Princeton University, he served in the United States  Coast Guard during World War II and  later traveled the world as a Foreign  Service Officer of the State Department. In 1960, he was elected to his  first of six terms as a United States  Senator from Rhode Island. After retiring in 1997, he became our State’s longest-serving Senator.

9,House,111,-0.342,23,2009-01-07,Mr. SHERMAN.," I will take much but  not all of this hour to speak. Roughly,  the first half of the presentation will  be on our economic situation. The second half will focus on foreign policy.  I know that I have a number of colleagues  that may  have  important  things to say to this House, and if they  come to the floor, I’ll be happy to yield  them a few minutes at a time that is  convenient for them.  Even with this long speech, I will not  be able to cover all the details that I’d  like  to  provide  to my  colleagues.  Therefore, I invite all my colleagues to  visit the relevant portion of my web  page, bradsherman.house.gov for more  of the details of the matters I’ll be discussing here.  In talking about our economy, I will  divide my speech first to talking about  matters relevant to the Financial Services Committee, on which I’ve served  for 12 years, and particularly the bill  known as TARP, or EESA, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, best  known to the public as the $700 billion  bailout bill.  The second part of my economic presentation will deal with the stimulus  package now being put together, particularly by the Committees on Appropriations and Ways and Means.  Now, I was a critic and twice voted  against the $700 billion bailout bill, the  so-called TARP. The supporters of that  bill will have to admit that it has not  restored  our  economy  as  the  proponents had advertised, and, in fact,  some of the worst times for the economy were the 2 to 3 weeks following its  passage.  On the other hand, those of us who  were critics should admit that the bill  has, frankly, cost the government far  less than I had anticipated. When I say  cost, I don’t mean just how much is  spent, but  from  that must be  subtracted the value of the securities, the  bonds and the stock certificates received by the Federal Government.  In this case, Secretary Paulson misled this House and the other body by  testifying that he would use the $700  billion to buy toxic assets, bad bonds.  Had he done that, and all of us voting  on the bill had every reason to believe  that he was telling us the truth, had he  carried out that policy, then he would  have bought,  for the money he had  spent, whether it’s the 350 billion he  has spent so far or the 700 billion that  I feared he would spend, he would have  spent that money in return for assets  of dubious value. That’s why they’re  called toxic assets.  In contrast, having misled the House  and the other body, Secretary Paulson  bought preferred stock in the various  financial institutions. In doing so, he  was overly generous to Wall Street as  to the terms, but, nevertheless, he did  secure assets for the Treasury that are  of substantial value.  Paulson’s shift,  frankly, was right  along the lines that many of us who  are critics of the bill had urged him to  adopt. And so those who supported the  bill, those who are critics of it, must  both recognize that what the Treasury  has done so far is far different from  what all of us believed would, in fact,  be the policy.  Now, we see that $350 billion has been  expended by the Treasury, and another  $350 billion  remains unspent.  I am  pleased  that  the Secretary  of  the  Treasury has not yet taken the procedural actions to release and give himself control of the remaining $350 billion.  It is my understanding that leadership will bring to this House a bill that  will  release  the  $350 billion  to  the  Treasury and will  impose additional  conditions. And I’d like to take a few  minutes to address what I think ought  to be in that bill.  First, is the issue of whether any of  the funds to be released, any of that  second $350 billion, will be available to  the Bush administration. Last month I  wrote the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee  saying  that we  should have limits on the amount that  could be spent by the Bush administration out of the second $350 billion. In  fact, I proposed that only $10 billion or  less be available to the Bush administration to deal with whatever exigencies it dealt with in its waning days. It  is my understanding that the bill that  will be brought before this House will  provide the Bush administration with  $0 to deal with whatever comes up in  its last week or so in office.  In any case,  I think, having seen  Paulson in action, the vast majority of  this House would believe that somewhere between 95 percent and 100 percent of the second $350 billion, if it is  made available to anyone in the executive branch should be made available  only to the Obama administration.  I should point out something about  process. It would be best if any bill  dealing with the second $350 billion was  actually dealt with in regular order.  Now, I’m not saying necessarily that  every committee of possible jurisdiction should do a full markup, but as we  deal with this economic crisis, at least  the primary committee as to each bill  should have a markup so that Members  can be heard, and the House can work  its will.  In addition, I would hope that the  Rules Committee would allow a reasonable number of amendments to be considered on the floor.  In addition, I would hope that the Financial Services Committee would give  the same scrutiny to the financial institutions who have received and are  likely  to  receive additional bailout  monies as we gave to the executives of  the three automobile makers.  We need extensive hearings. We need  to bring the titans of Wall Street down,  and we need to have these hearings at  both the full committee and the subcommittee level.  We do not want to give further credence to the accusation that Congress  and the administration have two standards for scrutinizing bailout requests,  one for those who shower before work  and a more severe standard for those  who must  shower  after work. We  should have at least the same amount  of scrutiny to an industry that has already received the bulk of $350 billion  as we provided to an automobile industry that  is requesting amounts  less  than 5 percent of that amount.  Now, what should we provide in the  way of restrictions to those who obtain  bailout  funds or  retain  the bailout  funds they have already received?  Federal dollars should be expended to  bail out private interests only on the  toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yield, the largest equity upside, the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. Even  when we bail out  individual homeowners rather than big time executives  and shareholders of major companies,  the Treasury should get a large share  of the profit that they earn when they  sell their homes.  Why is it so important that we are  tough on those who seek bailout funds?  There are  three  important  reasons.  First, being tough will increase support  for the program. The public  is currently focused on executive compensation and perks. I think it will soon  focus on the value of the securities the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:20 Jan 08, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07JA7.051 H07JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009

11,Senate,111,-0.326,37,2009-01-07,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Madam President, I rise today to honor a giant of  the Senate, my colleague and the senior Senator from West Virginia, ROBERTC. BYRD.  Yesterday we watched a number of  new Senators take an enormously important oath to serve our country and  to defend our Constitution. I was included  in  taking  that  oath  and  I  couldn’t help but think of my new colleagues.  If  these new Senators are  looking for an inspiration, a guiding  light, or a model, the way that I did  some years ago, they need look no further than the seat directly behind our  distinguished majority leader.  In that seat they will find a man who  took that same oath that we did 50  years ago  today. Senator BYRD has  taken that oath a total of nine times.  He has cast more votes than anyone in  the history of the Senate. He has held  more leadership positions than anyone  in the history of the Senate. He has  served longer than anyone in the Senate. He has literally written the book  on the Senate and lived the story of  the Senate over five decades.  ROBERTC. BYRDis nothing short of a  legend. However, 50 years ago today he  was a young man from West Virginia  who married a coal miner’s daughter.  He had spent 4 years in the West Virginia Legislature and 6 years in the  U.S. House of Representatives.  No one could know in 1959 that he  would be a legend in 50 years. What  they did know was ROBERTCARLYLE  was an ambitious  self-starter  who would put himself through  law  school while serving in the U.S. Congress.

12,Senate,111,0.509,44,2009-01-07,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, in mid-  June, I asked Idahoans to share with  me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded by  the hundreds. The stories, numbering  well over 1,200, are heartbreaking and  touching. While  energy prices have  dropped in recent weeks, the concerns  expressed remain very relevant. To respect the efforts of those who took the  opportunity to share their thoughts, I  am submitting every e-mail sent to me  through an address set up specifically  for this purpose to the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD. This is not an issue that will  be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves  immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard.  Their  stories not only detail  their  struggles to meet everyday expenses  but also have  suggestions and  recommendations as to what Congress can  do now to tackle this problem and find  solutions that last beyond today. I ask  unanimous consent to have today’s letters printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  Thank you for your newsletter regarding  the current problem of gasoline prices. I am  a widow living on Social Security income.  My car is a 1981 Volvo. Driving my car has  almost come to a standstill. I drive only for  necessities. I  feel  like a bear hibernating  over the winter. The idea of buying a new car  with better mileage is out of the question for  me.  As to the things our Nation should be  doing—these include drilling for oil wherever  available, using oil shale, developing nuclear  power, windmills, biofuels. Using corn  for  ethanol is the craziest idea of all. The commodities market is hitting new highs almost  daily. With the floods in Iowa, we cannot afford to use corn for oil. The animals that  need corn for food are affecting our prices in  the grocery store. Get rid of regulations that  cause energy companies to take years to develop energy or cause no action because of  the red tape of government.  Blaming the oil companies for so-called obscene profits is nonsense. Taxes on gasoline  are more than profits per gallon of gas that  the oil companies collect. Exxon has even  said that they are closing some stations because of non profit. It is sad that many do  not understand the basics of economics.  The American public has spoken. Stop listening  to  the environmentalists. Because  there has been no foresight, we are suffering  now for the lack of action by those in the  past who we elected to represent us. Both  parties are responsible, but blaming does not  get the job done.  It is embarrassing to read that France has  developed their nuclear power while we just  sit and talk about it. It is sad knowing that  foreign countries are acquiring leases to drill  for oil in our backyard, while we just sit and  watch what is going on in the Gulf of Mexico  and grumble about it. It is humiliating to  hear those who say we are becoming a third  world nation. Americans are known for their  innovation.  Gasoline prices are affecting food prices,  small businesses and the cost of all goods  and services. Independent truckers are suffering. We rely on them for delivery of our  food and goods to market. If their numbers  decrease because of their cost of doing business, it will cause an additional increase in  prices or possibly the disappearance of some  goods. I do not think we want that to happen  to our food supplies.  The time has come to act. Now is the time.  We must not waste time. The public is begging for some common sense to solve these  problems. Egos must be ignored lest we suffer more. Corporate America knows how to  solve these problems. Do not hinder them  any more with government red tape.  LAVERGNE, Hayden.  Our family lives about 30 miles from Idaho  Falls where we do most of our business. My  daughter and I also drive about 32 miles each  way to our places of work so we are impacted  every day. Our best guess is that we are  spending about $400 per month more now  than we did when gas was $2 per gallon. So  far our response has been to curtail vacation  traveling and reduce other unnecessary purchases.  Solutions (in order of preference):  1. Pursue increased domestic oil drilling  including off-shore and ANWR and encourage  construction of more refineries. I believe environmental concerns have been greatly exaggerated and need to be evaluated based on  their cost effectiveness relative to their impact on the cost of living versus risk to our  quality of life.  2. Pursue alternative energy sources only  as  far they are cost-effective. If bio-fuels  need to be subsidized in order to maintain  production, they are obviously not cost-effective.  3. Pursue nuclear power generation (we are  20 years behind). There is also potential for  hydrogen as a by-product that could be used  as an alternative to gasoline. I have doubts  about wind generation as a cost-effective alternative energy source, and I personally do  not care for it is adverse effect on the natural beauty of Idaho’s landscapes.  4. Pursue  improved coal-fired electrical  generation. I also have serious concerns regarding the apparent race to reduce CO2  emissions at any cost when there is so little  real evidence that proves a correlation with  global warming (also unverified).  5.

13,Senate,111,0.068,51,2009-01-07,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I seek  recognition to speak on legislation I  am introducing that will require the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold at least one public hearing  before issuance of a permit affecting  public or private land use in a locality.  I introduced legislation on this issue at  the end of the 110th Congress, and fully  expect  it to remain relevant as we  move forward with upgrades to our energy infrastructure, possibly as part of  an economic  stimulus package. The  legislation has been updated; namely,  it now allows  for a second hearing  when officially requested by a county  or local government to address issues  not addressed at the original hearing.  Increasing  demand  for  electricity  throughout the Northeast is putting a  strain on energy infrastructure in my  State, necessitating new transmission  lines and natural gas pipelines and the  expansion of existing ones. In southwestern and northeast Pennsylvania  transmission  line  expansions  are  planned over hundreds of miles of private property, while in the southeast  natural gas pipeline expansions are underway.  There is no doubt these projects can  be invasive, and rarely do they fail to  be controversial. I make a point of  touching all of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties each year. In traveling Pennsylvania this Fall I heard a lot of complaints, which didn’t come as a surprise. I heard frequently from constituents who oppose these infrastructure  projects, and who felt their concerns  were being ignored by the energy companies and by FERC.  I realize there will always be some  opposition  to  large  infrastructure  projects. What  is unacceptable, however, is for the people of my State to  feel that their voices were not heard,  that their issues were ignored. It may  be the case that these projects are necessary. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is the authority, and in  exercising its authority it must be sensitive to local concerns.  To address this I propose simply that  FERC hold a hearing in these affected  communities. In many cases this is already done, but my legislation makes  it mandatory. State Public Utility  Commissions, who have a great say in  these matters, are beyond Congress’  reach. But where the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission is involved we  can take steps to ensure that our constituents’ concerns receive due consideration. Holding a hearing may not  lead to all sides agreeing on the proper  route forward, but at the very least my  Pennsylvania constituents will come  away with the satisfaction of having  publicly aired their grievances.  To ensure that constituent concerns  are given all due consideration, my legislation allows for affected parties to  petition for a second hearing, provided  certain conditions are met. In order for  a second hearing to occur, a county  government, or a municipal government within the affected county, must  petition  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a second hearing. A second hearing will only occur  to address an issue that was not addressed at the initial hearing, and the  hearing shall occur between 30 and 60  days after approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The safeguards included in this legislation are critical to protecting individual property rights. As the Nation  moves forward in making needed updates to its infrastructure, defending  citizens’ constitutional right to redress  their government with their concerns  should be paramount for this Congress.  I will continue to fight to allow my  constituents to be heard when Federal  projects will  affect  their  homeowners and landowners.  rights  as  f  STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED  BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS  By Mr. BINGAMAN:  S. 22.

15,,111,-0.366,65,2009-01-07,Mr. PASCRELL.," Madam Speaker, it is my  pleasure  today  to  introduce  the  ‘‘Paterson  Great Falls National Historical Park Act’’ as  my first act in the 111th Congress. This bipartisan legislation was approved by the House in  October 2007, and would designate a National  Park at the majestic Great Falls in Paterson,  NJ. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation as soon as possible.  Fifteen miles west of New York City,  the  Great Falls was the second largest waterfall in  colonial America. No other natural wonder in  America has played such an important role in  our nation’s historic quest  for  freedom and  prosperity. At the Great Falls, Alexander Hamilton conceived and  implemented a plan  to  harness the force of water to power the new  industries  that would secure our economic  independence.  Hamilton  told Congress and  the American  people that at the Great Falls he would begin  implementation of his ambitious strategy  to  transform a rural agrarian society dependent  upon slavery into a modern economy based  on  freedom.  True  to  Hamilton’s  vision,  Paterson became a great manufacturing city,  producing  the Colt  revolver,  the  first  submarine, the aircraft engine for the first trans-  Atlantic flight, more locomotives than any city  in the Nation, and more silk than any city in  the world.  New Jersey’s Great Falls  is  the only National Historic District that includes both a National Natural Resource and a National Historic  Landmark.  In  a  special Bicentennial  speech in Paterson with the spectacular natural beauty of  the Great Falls  in  the background,  the  late President Gerald R. Ford  said, ‘‘We can see the Great Falls as a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make  America  the most powerful Nation  in  the  world.’’  Preeminent Hamilton biographers, an esteemed former Smithsonian Institution curator,  the former chief of the National Park Service  Historic American Engineering Record, and  distinguished professors at Yale, Princeton,  Harvard, NYU, Brown and other universities  have filed letters with the National Park Service strongly recommending a National Historical Park for the Great Falls Historic District.  Editorial boards, Federal, State, and local officials and community groups have also endorsed the campaign to award a National Park  Service designation to the Falls.

16,,111,-0.317,65,2009-01-07,Mr. COSTELLO.," Madam Speaker,  for  the  past several years, Israelis living near Gaza  have endured a continual state of fear due to  the thousands of rocket attacks launched from  there by Hamas. When the six-month cease  fire between Hamas and Israel recently ended,  Hamas responded almost immediately by firing more than 70 missiles at civilian targets  within Israel. On December 27th, Israel, in an  act of self defense, struck at Hamas targets in  Gaza in response to these continued attacks,  and I want to express my strong support for  Israel’s right of self-defense.  Israel has taken meaningful steps in recent  years to push the peace process forward, including unilaterally withdrawing from Gaza in  2005. Unfortunately, Hamas  has  not met  Israel’s efforts towards a peaceful coexistence,  and has instead increased military operations  against  its neighbor and continues  to deny  Israel’s right to exist.  These unfortunate developments are tragic,  but have been precipitated by Hamas’ aggression. Hamas must stop the rocket attacks and  all parties in the region need to commit to renewing efforts at peace. The U.S. should remain involved in the peace process and I will  continue to work with my colleagues in Congress towards this goal.

During the recent holiday season, I had the  privilege of visiting Iraq and Afghanistan with  a Congressional Delegation led by Representative GENE of Mississippi and witnessed  first hand  the  important work being  done by the men and women of our armed  forces. Our group spent time meeting with civilian and military  leaders  serving on  the  ground in each country. The holidays are always a difficult time for the men and women  of  the armed  forces as  they are away  from  their loved ones. One of the things that they  will  tell you makes  this  time of year a  little  easier  is  to enjoy some of  the comforts of  home.  Thanks  to  Bob Munson,  President  of  Munson’s Chocolates of Bolton, the men and  women of  the 890th Engineer Battalion and  the 926th Engineer Brigade, Multi-National Division currently serving in Baghdad were able  to enjoy a sweet reminder of home. A  few  days before Christmas Congressman TAYLOR  arranged for 2,000 pounds of shrimp gumbo to  be served to the battalion and Munson’s donated almost 600 Connecticut made chocolate  bars for dessert. This gift is just another example of  the generosity of  the Munson  family,  who  for generations has been active supporters of the military community.  The Munson  family of employees  is no  stranger  to  the heartache  families endure  while their loved ones are serving overseas.  During my visit to the Munson factory, I had  the honor of meeting Kay Doherty. Kay’s son  Stephen recently returned from a tour in Iraq.  As Kay can attest,  the holidays are an extremely difficult and  trying  time  for military  families which is why this generous gift is so  timely.  f  HONORING  WAS  NO  TEACHERS  JADE MOORE, THERE  BETTER  FRIEND  OF  HON.

21,Senate,111,0.382,4,2009-01-29,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, as always, I care for the Senator from California. We are good friends. You know,  I hasten to point out that her own  State of California has approved unborn  child State  plans. Look,  this  amendment by definition has nothing  to do with abortion since women who  seek help covering their unborn children’s health are not women seeking  abortion. They are separate, and the  Senator should not try to mix them.  This is not an issue about abortion.  This is an issue about a living, unborn  child and her or his mother.  I might add that 14 States have approved unborn child State plans, including the States of Arkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Oklahoma,  Oregon,  Rhode  Island,  Tennessee,  Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin have  all approved unborn child State plans.  I agree with the Senator, the bill has  worked beautifully, the CHIP bill, for  the last 10 years. I know. I wrote every  word in it and did so with Senators  KENNEDY, ROCKEFELLER, CHAFEE, and  others, as a matter of fact. But I don’t  think anybody doubts that I carried  the ball in getting that bill through  the Finance Committee and the whole  Congress.  I see a one-sided attempt here to  change the bill in ways that will make  it less effective and not cover as many  children as it should. Some argue the  legislation already gives States the option to cover pregnant women, so this  amendment is not necessary. But the  distinct difference between this amendment and what is in the underlying bill  is that this amendment allows States  to cover children before birth. Children  have health needs as much before as  after they are born, so legislation to  promote  children’s health  ought  to  cover them. Let me emphasize that  this is a State option, not a State requirement.  Some argue this amendment is an attempt to inject, as I think the distinguished Senator from California has argued, the abortion issue into a bipartisan effort to protect children’s health  through the authorizing of the CHIP  program. The truth is exactly the opposite. As I said when introducing my  amendment, this has nothing to do  with abortion. It has everything to do  with promoting children’s health, and  any reasonable person ought to be concerned about the unborn as much as  they are the born and, of course, the  mother  involved.  This  amendment  takes care of all three.  I feel very strongly about this. I do  not think anybody should try to make  this an abortion issue—not myself, not  the distinguished Senator  from California, or anybody else, for that matter. I don’t see how anybody can vote  against an amendment that protects  the life of the unborn child after having read the Constitution about  its  great desire to protect life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. That is what  this amendment is all about.  I feel strongly about it. I hope our  colleagues will support it, because it  would be a great thing to help this bill  along. I would feel much better if this  was amended. I have to admit, I do not  feel good about the approach that has  been taken by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.  The fact is that Senator GRASSLEY  and I carried the ball for the last 2  BAUCUS, ROCKEFELLER, DURBIN,  years, working with Senators REID,  and  others; working with the House, Speaker of the House PELOSI, Rahm Emanuel  and others who were there, including  STENYHOYER.  We worked closely together to do  CHIPRA I. We got an overwhelming  vote in the Senate. On CHIPRA II, we  got an overwhelming vote in the Senate, enough to override the President’s  veto in the Senate. I do not think that  would have happened but for the bipartisan effort we put together. We had a  solid, strong vote in the House, but not  enough  to  override  the President’s  veto.  Now, I have heard people run down  President Bush for his vetoes on CHIP.  I think President Bush followed the advice of some very young advisers in the  White House who basically gave him  bad advice. Had he allowed CHIPRA I  or CHIPRA II to go through, we would  not be having this awful debate today;  we would all be together. The whole  Congress would have been  together,  and this whole effort would have been  truly bipartisan. We could have set a  bipartisan tone right off the bat, instead of this partisan tone that has  been set by bringing up the bill without even talking to the two lead Republicans who in 2007 worked so carefully, honestly, and diligently to try  and bring about a bipartisan resolution  for a new CHIP bill.  And, by the way, we took a lot of  flack in the process from some in the  administration and some on our side  for supporting the legislation in 2007.  We took it. We took it gladly. And our  colleagues on the other side saw us  take it. They saw us stand firm. They  saw Senator GRASSLEY and myself  stand on the floor, along with a whole  host of others, in a bipartisan way, putting together what would have made  CHIP even better for the next certainly  5 years.  This bill only funds the CHIP program for 41⁄2years, because if they had  gone the extra half year, it would have  priced the bill out of the marketplace.  But I have to say, we are going to have  to come up with that money anyway,  and end up going that extra half year.  So  everybody better understand all  that is being done today by my friends  on the left, ignoring people, like me  and  Senator  who  have  worked so closely with them—and they  have a right to do that. I can live with  that, as I vote against their partisan  bill.  All I can say is they have a right to  do it. But it is the wrong thing to do.  It is the wrong way to start off this  Congress after the President himself  has shown such a propensity to want to  work together. I have to say, I was  there when the President came and  spoke to our caucus last Tuesday. He  was  impressive. He was  friendly. He  was making every effort to be bipartisan. But he apparently had not fully  examined the stimulus bill that has  been passed only in a partisan way by  GRASSLEY,  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:11 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.004 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

24,Senate,111,0.377,11,2009-01-29,Mr. WICKER.," Mr. President,  the  SCHIP legislation the Senate is considering this week purports to provide  more health insurance for our Nation’s  poorest children. But in truth, the bill  shortchanges the neediest of children  in States such as Mississippi. Instead  of paying taxpayer dollars for our poorest children, those who need health insurance the most, the bill we are considering today gives taxpayer-funded  health insurance to middle-class families in wealthy States. The SCHIP bill  we will be voting on today does nothing to ensure that all American children under 200 percent of the poverty  level have health insurance. In fact,  the bill diverts  this  important program, which I have supported for years,  away from its intended purpose. SCHIP  was designed to cover low-income children between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That comes  to $22,000 to $44,000 per year for a family of four. These families require assistance under SCHIP because  they  earn too much to qualify for Medicaid,  but they are not able to afford private  health coverage for their children. This  was the intent of SCHIP.  What we ought to be doing in this  bill is prioritizing low-income American children and making sure as many  uninsured poor kids as possible are covered under the increased funding we  are going to provide. Instead, this bill  allows States to expand their programs  without demonstrating they have covered the poorest children first. In my  State  of Mississippi,  for  example,  SCHIP covers 65,000 children, but there  are another 30,000 children below 200  percent of the poverty level who are  without health  insurance. This  bill  would not cover those children, even  with the expanded funding.  Other States that are similarly situated include Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Arkansas. I  urge the Senators from those States to  join me in an effort to correct this inequity. I urge all Senators to make  this bill better so we make sure we include poorest of the poor children first.  In the past decade since SCHIP was  created, the number of uninsured poor  children has decreased from 28 percent  to 15 percent. But we cannot, in the  face of that success story, neglect the  remaining 15 percent. Many of them  are in the States I have mentioned.  Fifteen percent of America’s poorest  children still do not have health care,  and we are debating a bill that would  expand SCHIP beyond its intended purpose, to cover higher income families  and other adults.  SCHIP allotments in fiscal year 2009  will be $5 billion. Under this bill we  would almost double that amount to $9  billion per year. But only an additional  $79 million  is needed to cover these  poor uncovered children in States such  as Mississippi. If we are going to almost double the size of the program,  we ought to make sure poorest of the  poor are covered.  If this bill were really about health  care for poor children, we would guarantee each State sufficient  funds to  cover every child in a family below 200  percent of the poverty level. It is that  simple. And we would do that before  moving on to cover more affluent families in the more affluent States.  Senator COCHRAN and  I have  submitted an amendment that would do  that. Our amendment would prohibit  States from receiving funds to cover  individuals above 200 percent of the  poverty level until we can guarantee  that 90 percent—not 100 percent but 90  percent—of  the poorest children nationwide are covered.  The result of our amendment would  be that the more affluent States would  simply have to wait if they want to  cover middle-class  children,  if  they  want to cover families making as much  as $88,000 a year or more. They would  have to wait until the poorest of the  poor children in Mississippi and Arkansas and North Carolina and North Dakota and Nebraska and Iowa are covered.  I have been watching the votes this  week.  It appears the  leadership has  locked in a majority to resist amendments of this nature. I thought the bill  was about making it easier to cover  children under 200 percent of the poverty level—between 100 percent and 200  percent. If amendments such as that of  Senator COCHRAN and myself are not  agreed to, we have to wonder is the  real intent of this legislation to replace our private health care system  with a government-run system at the  expense of people who need help the  most?  One of my colleagues yesterday said  we are ruining SCHIP. I have to concur  with that,  if this  legislation  is not  amended. I urge my colleagues to join  me in bringing the focus of SCHIP back  where it belongs, on helping poor children.  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

25,Senate,111,-0.212,18,2009-01-29,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, basically the Bunning amendment is the  fourth amendment that would put a  cap on eligibility. Yesterday the Senate rejected the Cornyn amendment  that would cap it at 200 percent of poverty, a Roberts amendment with a cap  of $65,000, and a Murkowski amendment with a cap of 300 percent of poverty. All these amendments, including  the Bunning  amendment,  have  the  same flaw; that is, they would raise the  possibility of kicking kids off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan; that is,  they  are  diminishing  amendments.  They do not add, they subtract. The  kids currently on the Children’s Health  Insurance Plan are taken off. That is  not something I think we want to do.  The specific amendment in question  here will have that effect. It will basically say that because the States that  have been mentioned here essentially  get a match rate according to the Children’s Health Insurance Plan, that because of the amendment—the amendment says they will get less, they will  get the Medicaid match rate, which is  less than the Children’s Health Insurance Plan; therefore, those kids cannot  participate.  Theoretically there could be some  participation because the match rate  in Medicaid, which I think is around 15  percent lower—in the case of let’s say  New York or New Jersey—than the  Children’s  Health  Insurance  Plan  match. But still the effect is the same.  If this amendment were to go into effect, children currently in, say, New  Jersey who  receive  the  Children’s  Health Insurance Plan match rate will  probably get kicked off. A lot will be  kicked off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan because the match rate is  lower, down to the Medicaid rate.  That is not right. The fact is all of  these  amendments,  including  the  Bunning amendment, are restrictive. It  is constrictive. It is a reducing amendment. It pressures to take children off  the Children’s Health Insurance Plan  rather than add children.  People talk about 200 percent of poverty, 300 percent of poverty, et cetera.  I think New Jersey is at 350 percent of  poverty. One interesting point there is  they are at that rate, A, because they  asked for it and, B, because President  Bush’s administration gave a waiver  and said, yes, go ahead and do it. President Bush, his administration, and the  Republican Secretary of HHS,  said,  yes, New York, go ahead and do that.  That is fine. You should do that.  One can guess why they may have  granted that waiver. The reason is because when you talk poverty  levels,  such as 200 percent of poverty, that is  a national figure. It is not a different  number for each State, it is what is the  national number. New Jersey, I think,  has the highest per capita income of  any State in the Nation. Clearly, the  Federal poverty level which applies to  New Jersey probably does not match  what the realities are in that State.  The realities are if you take a family a  little bit above the national median income, a family in that State, in New  Jersey,  is probably  facing the same  economic pressures and difficulties—  paying for health insurance, providing  for  the kids and  the kids’ medical  bills—as would the average family in a  State where the median income is the  same as the national median income.  That is probably why New Jersey asked  for that waiver and probably why the  Republican Secretary of Health and  Human Services granted that waiver.  But that is where we are. That is history. It makes sense.  The fact is, this amendment says, no,  we are going to undo that, even though  New Jersey is used to it, even though  New Jersey applied for the waiver and  lawfully was granted the waiver, we  say: No, no, not that anymore. We are  going to reduce the match rate you and  New Jersey get and it is again going to  have the pressure of hurting kids in  that State and taking kids off the Children’s Health Insurance Plan. That is  not the right thing to do.  I therefore respectfully urge Senators  to not support this restrictive amendment which does not add kids to the  Children’s  Health  Insurance  Plan.  Rather, it takes kids off the Children’s  Health Insurance Plan.  ",2009

34,Senate,111,-0.308,46,2009-01-29,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I support the nomination of ADM Dennis  Blair to be Director of National Intelligence. I do so as a strong supporter of  intelligence reform and in the belief  that Admiral Blair brings not only a  keen  understanding  of  the  current  challenges to interagency cooperation  but an enthusiasm for reform. I am  also encouraged by his consistent and  repeated  commitments  to keep  the  congressional intelligence committees  fully and currently informed, and his  desire  to end  the  stonewalling conducted by  the Bush administration.  The confirmation process has raised a  number of issues of concern that I believe have been adequately addressed,  although it is my hope and expectation  that Admiral Blair, if confirmed, will  work with me and other members of  the committee on these, as well as  other important matters.  Admiral Blair has committed to ending the Bush administration practice of  hiding programs such as the CIA detention  program  and  the  President’s  warrantless wiretapping program from  the full committee and has said that  these programs ‘‘were less effective and  did not have sufficient legal and constitutional foundations because the intelligence committees were prevented  from carrying out their oversight responsibilities.’’ He has also committed  to breaking down the stovepiping of  oversight whereby  Intelligence Committee members are denied access to  important Department of Defense activities. These commitments are a critical  first  step  in ensuring effective  oversight and in reestablishing a collaborative  relationship  between  our  two branches of Government.  While I was disappointed with Admiral Blair’s refusal, at his hearing, to  characterize waterboarding as torture,  I am confident that he will carry out  President  Obama’s  Executive  order  prohibiting  ‘‘enhanced  interrogation  techniques.’’ I am also assured by his  statement  that  ‘‘the United States  must not render or otherwise transfer  anyone to a country unless we have  credible assurances that they will not  be subject to torture or other unacceptable treatment.’’  His statements on privacy, civil liberties and checks and balances have  also been reassuring. He has expressed  concern about the U.S. Government’s  accumulation of detailed private information on U.S. citizens. He has reaffirmed that FISA is the ‘‘only legal  authority for conducting surveillance  within  the United States  for  intelligence purposes.’’ He told me at his  hearing that he would submit  intelligence programs to the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel at  the outset, so that they are conducted  under  clear  legal  authorities. And,  more generally, he has stated that he  sees it has his responsibility to ‘‘make  clear that protecting the privacy and  civil liberties of Americans is as important as gathering intelligence.’’ I do  have  concerns  about his  statement  that he supports immunity for companies  that allegedly  cooperated with  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:42 Jan 30, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29JA6.032 S29JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
35,House,111,-0.266,2,2009-02-09,Mr. POMEROY.," Madam Speaker, last  month the employment of George W.  Bush came to an end. Unfortunately, so  did the jobs of nearly 600,000 Americans, hardworking men and women hit  in every sector of our economy, thrown  out of work in the toughest recession  to hit our Nation in decades.  The job losses of January show that  this is an accelerating recession. We  lost 1.7 million  jobs  in the  first 10  months of 2008, then almost 600,000 in  the month of November, again in December, again in January.  Look at this chart. This shows how  this recession compares to the other  two. No easing of job loss, no end in  sight.  We must pass a stimulus responding  to this crisis. This is the worst rate of  job loss ever recorded. We must help  Barack Obama, our new President, respond to this economic crisis  facing  our Nation.  f  MONEY FOR THE MOB MUSEUM  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

And I was shocked and, quite frankly,  disappointed to learn that the new administration has failed to fill its seat  and has washed its hands of even questioning  these  countries.  How  can  America be silent about  four of the  worst offenders of human rights and religious freedom around the world?  China has been designated by the  State Department’s annual Religious  Freedom report as a country of particular concern since 1999. No administration comments.  Saudi Arabia has received this designation,  too. Again, no  comments  from the new administration.  The U.S. Commission on Religious  Freedom placed Cuba on their watch  list. Again, no comment from this administration.  The administration made a pledge to  place human rights at the top of its  agenda, and yet they’re absent at this  very critical point. This is a bad start  for this administration in the area of  human rights and religious freedom.

37,House,111,0.425,2,2009-02-09,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Madam Speaker, breaking news. The national media  spells scandal without the ‘‘D.’’  Two weeks ago the Governor of Illinois was removed from office. All three  television networks ran full reports on  the story the same night and again the  following morning. Not  one  report  mentioned that he is a Democrat.  The same has been true of numerous  other Democrats recently embroiled in  scandal. CNN ignored the party affiliation of the Democratic Mayor of Baltimore as news broke that she had been  indicted. The AP did the same while  covering the indictment of the former  Democratic Mayor of Detroit. And in  the aftermath of his sex scandal, network newscasts apparently forgot that  the former Governor of New York is a  Democrat.

Kennedy,  elected  on  a  platform  of  change, said, ‘‘Let us never negotiate  out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.’’  I ask my friends from both parties to  heed this advice and reject the politics  of fear. Let’s not fear the negotiating  table. Let’s talk about meaningful bipartisan solutions that will benefit our  country and get people back to work.

42,House,111,-0.256,16,2009-02-09,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, we are  here this afternoon to talk about a serious subject, something gravely facing  our country, and that is the budget deficit for this fiscal year 2009 and for the  years thereafter for as far as the eye  can see.  As we speak, the deficit for the year  2009, fiscal 2009, is soaring to record  highs. CBO, the Congressional Budget  Office, our budget shop, which is neutral and nonpartisan, has recently projected that the deficit for 2009 will be  $1.2 trillion. And as high as this projection may be, our friends, it’s probably  a low-ball estimate.  It omits,  for example, the supplemental to pay for our deployment in  Afghanistan and Iraq, which will be  around $70 billion for the remainder of  this fiscal year; it assumes that the alternative minimum tax will stay in full  force and effect reaching 20 or so million-income tax payers for whom it was  never intended. This increases the revenues by $70 billion though AMT has,  in fact, been omitted year so that it  does not apply for middle-income taxpayers for whom it was not intended.  It also assumes that the tax cuts  passed in 2001 and 2003, despite the fact  that we have huge deficits, will expire  on December 31, 2010, and as provided  by the law which enacted them in the  first place.  When you add all of these into the  equation—the Bush  administration’s  last deficit, the deficit that we inherited  from President Bush and must  work our way out of—the deficit could  easily top $1.4 trillion. It staggers the  imagination.  These are deficits that happened on  the watch of the Bush administration  and under their fiscal policies. But we,  as Democrats, won the election, and it  is our responsibility to decide what  should we do about the deficits left us.  Unfortunately, we’ve got forces converging on the budget which make it  difficult to bring the deficit down to  realistic terms. For example, we have  the severest economic downturn in our  economy since at least the first or second world war ended. So we have the  mounting  costs  of  counter-cyclical  policies, TARP, the stimulus now pending in the Senate, the conservatorship  of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. All of  these things are hugely expensive. We  have the rising costs of major entitlements—Social  Security,  Medicare,  Medicaid—due to the retirement of the  baby boomers.  We have defense budgeted and funded  at historically high  levels and  sustained for an historically long period of  time. Funds  funded to  front-end accounts, accounts in the budget which  need to be funded adequately but are  not. Transportation is a good example.  It will exhaust its reserve early next  year and run close to zero unless we  can get funds back into that particular  account.  Of course, as always  there’s education, which is not funded as robustly  as many of us think it should be. And  of course there are new topics—alternative energies and various incentives  for increasing the energy supplies and  making  this  country  energy  independent.  b1645  Then we have the renewal of existing  tax cuts, which are slated to expire on  December 31, 2010.  When we add all of these things in, in  addition to the price commitments we  have to do something about the climate and something about universal  health care coverage, it becomes very,  very difficult to do anything to the  bottom line of the budget, despite the  fact that it is bigger than it has ever  been before in peace time.  The overarching question that faces  this whole country as we incur these  huge sums of debt is: How long will foreigners help us? How long will they  keep buying our Treasury debt?  We have, therefore, the worst budget  since World War II and the worst economy in which to work out the problems  of these budgets. Every recession has  its own pattern to it. But it is clear  that it is difficult in every recession,  any recession, to work out of the recession when you’re swimming upstream,  when the economy is working against  you; to work out of a budget deficit  when the economy is working against  you.  Let me show you some charts, those  who are listening. This is a simple bar  graph. It shows that the Bush administration, when he came to office, had a  phenomenal inheritance. A budgeting  surplus over the next 10 years by $5.6  trillion. That was January, 2001.  By January, 2004, that surplus of $236  billion was gone. Vanished. In 4 year’s  time, we went from a $236 billion surplus to a $412 billion deficit. This happened under the policies and the watch  of the Bush administration.  This next chart portrays out over  time the assets of this administration  and the previous administration. This  is the first George Bush administration. The first Mr. Bush. There was a  significant decline  in the budget at  that point in time. But, when the Clinton  administration  came  to  office,  President Clinton sent us a budget in  February of 1993, on February 22, the  first full significant action taken by  his  administration,  and  every year  after the adoption of that budget by  one vote in the House and one vote in  the Senate,  the bottom  line  is  the  budget got better and better and better, to point where we were at this  point right here, 1997, 1998, the year  2000.  The budget was, in those years, balanced for the first time in recent memory. Then, in 2001, the year 2000, we had  a surplus of $236 billion. The second Mr.  Bush came to office here. You can see  the bottom line got worse and worse  and worse until there was a slight pickup here. But, then in the out years 2004,  2005, 2006, 2007, the budget got worse  and worse and worse, until the point it  runs off the chart at the bottom of the  page. That is the deficit we are now  looking at, a deficit of as much as $1.4  trillion.  Now, that would be a concern under  any circumstances. But, in the present  situation, the deficits that we have incurred over  the  last  10 years have  largely been  funded and  financed by  foreigners. Japan, China, Great Britain, Europe, and Pacific Rim countries.  They have run trade surpluses with us  and used the surplus dollars they hold  to buy back our Treasury bills. It’s a  convenient  short-term  arrangement.  But, over the long term, it means foreigners own more and more of our debt,  and you find it hard to be totally independent as a country, certainly the  world super power, when you’re also  the world’s largest debtor.  As of 2008, the total amount of foreign-held Treasury securities had tripled under the Bush administration.  Starting out at $1 trillion, it rose to  $3.1  trillion—over  $2  trillion—during  the period 2001 to 2008. That is the accumulation of  foreign-held Treasury  bills and certificates.  As for the total debt of the United  States, this  is where we began—$5.7  trillion in 2001. That is where the total  debt of the United States stood when  Mr. Bush came to office. A substantial  sum. But every year that number went  up and up and up, to the point where,  when he left office a couple of weeks  ago, the amount of debt stood at $10.7  trillion. Nearly doubled in an 8-year period of time—from $5.7 trillion to $10.7  trillion. And, as a consequence of that,  we are feeling the effects of it in all  sectors of our economy.  Would the gentlelady from Massachusetts care to make a comment or a  statement? I gladly yield time to her.

44,Senate,111,0.323,51,2009-02-09,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Madam President,  I thank the Senator from South Dakota  for his effective  leadership  in  helping  the American people understand the full implications of this legislation on American families. I ask  that  I be  informed when  I have  1  minute remaining.  A number of things have been said  about the so-called stimulus package,  which I feel, many of us feel, is more of  a spending bill than a stimulus bill.  But there is no doubt about the fact  that it increases our national debt.  The debt is not some abstract thing.  Our national debt is $10.7 trillion. This  adds  to  the national debt as much  money as—well, let’s put it this way. It  took from the beginning of the Republic until 1982 to have a cumulative debt  of $850 billion. And this bill is more  than that. This is a lot of money. We  are adding the $820 or 830 billion that  we have heard about plus the interest  over the next 10 years. That adds about  $10,000 to each family’s share of the  debt. Well, with that $10,000 you can  pay in-state tuition for 1.5 years at the  University of Tennessee. You could pay  for 21 years of public school lunches  every  day  for  the  average middle  school student. You could buy a gallon  of milk a week for 57 years. That is a  lot of money.  I wish to make three points today as  we  think  about  this  stimulus  bill  which, I believe, is more of a spending  bill. First, this bill makes a number of  policy decisions on education, health,  and energy that ought not to be made  in such a bill, but ought to be separately debated and considered.  No. 2, we should have all of the proposed  spending  on  the  table. Mr.  Geithner is coming up to Congress this  week to tell us how much we need for  banks. Then we need more for housing.  Then we need more for the war. I think  if we knew all of the money we are  about to have to borrow, our appetite  for spending $1.2 trillion, mostly on  projects that do not create jobs in the  next few months, would diminish.  And, third, this is not the kind of bipartisanship that I expected. As I listened to the President, I thought he  wanted to change the way Washington  works. The way Washington works in a  bipartisan way is for us to sit down and  talk with one another and come up  with something both Republicans and  Democrats can agree upon; not we won  the election, we will write the bill and  let’s see if we can pick off two or three  Senators.  First, a number of policy decisions.  The first version of the Senate bill actually doubled Federal  spending  for  education without any discussion.  I  used to be the Secretary of Education.  Today, that Department has about a  $68 billion budget. The original version  of the Senate bill doubles that. It took  40 years to get to $68 billion. But the  original Senate  bill would  increase  education spending by $140 billion over  the next two years—on top of that $68  billion we’re already spending per year.  So the bill would double the $68 billion  this year, and keep  it doubled next  year. Then it is supposed to go back  down to $68 billion the year after that,  which seems unlikely.  But there was no discussion about  this. Would you not think, if they were  going to double the Federal commitment to education, we would have a  discussion about what would be best to  spend  it on? I mean, are we so delighted with the performance in kindergarten through the 12th grade and  our preschool programs that we have  nothing to do but say, let’s double the  money for more of the same?  Even  the  small  things  that have  crept  into  the  legislation,  some of  which President Obama has said he  supports, should be fully debated. For  example, we have some new Senators  at the forefront of federal support for  the Teacher Incentive Fund. We have a  new Secretary of Education who supports this effort to help reward outstanding  teaching  and  outstanding  school leading, but not a penny was included in the Senate bill.  What about charter schools? A lot of  us on both sides of the aisle want to  give teachers the freedom to use their  own common sense and good judgment  in dealing with the children who are  brought to them. That is what a public  charter school does. Not a penny in the  Senate bill.  So education is the first policy area  that should have been debated separately. Then on health care, the House  added nearly $90 billion for Medicaid.  The President has  said we need  to  make health care available to every  American. We Republicans agree with  that. So we are ready to have a debate  about that. That will cost some money.  One of the major proposals, in fact,  the one that has the most bipartisan  support,  the Wyden-Bennett  legislation, would get rid of the Medicaid Program and replace it with individual accounts. This preempts that decision by  giving $90 billion more to the States.  So the States get $90 billion. That is  a lot of money. Tennessee’s share of  that would be $1.5 or $2 billion. That is  going to make the program so rich the  States will not want to give it up, and  we will not be able to have a full discussion about health care when that  comes around.  Then an energy bill. Last year,  I  asked the Energy Information Administration to estimate what kind of subsidies we were doing for renewable energy, because it seemed to me it was  all going to wind and nothing else. I  was about right.  EIA said: We are subsidizing wind at  27 times greater than all other forms of  renewable energy per kilowatt hour; 53  times greater than subsidies for coal  per kilowatt hour; and 15 times greater  than the subsidy  for nuclear, which  produces 70 percent of our carbon-free  electricity.  That was in the middle of last year.  That was at a time when we only were  committed to $11.5 billion to give to  rich people and big banks, some of  which we are bailing out, that get big  tax credits when they build wind turbines. So that was $11.5 billion in the  middle of last year.  Then  in October of  last year we  passed legislation that brought that up  to $16 billion over the next 10 years,  and this bill brings to $25.7 billion the  amount of taxpayer dollars that we are  paying rich people and banks so they  can get big tax credits  for building  wind turbines.  As far as the beautiful mountains of  North Carolina and Tennessee, I don’t  want those things littering our area,  particularly because the wind doesn’t  blow there enough to make it efficient.  But even in areas where it does make  sense, do we really need, without any  discussion, to go from $11.5 billion last  year to $26 billion this year with a national windmill policy? Why don’t we  have a debate about energy, and let’s  have a technology-neutral way to encourage all forms of renewable energy,  especially emerging forms.  We have an education bill, a health  care bill, and an energy bill, but we  don’t  have  a  stimulus  bill.  We  shouldn’t have all this on the table.  Mr. Geithner has apparently delayed  his recommendation about what we do  about credit and banks until we have  had the vote on this stimulus bill. This  was supposed to be a transparent administration. To be transparent, let’s  put it all out there. How much do we  need to appropriate for banks? I voted  for that twice now. I might vote for it  again if I think we need to do it. It was  not an easy vote, but I did it. How  much do we need to spend on housing?  How much do we need to spend on the  war in Afghanistan and to finish the  war in Iraq? How much do we need to  spend on  the health care plan  the  President and we in Congress have said  we want to work on? And how will we  shape all this into some control of entitlement spending? It would be nice if  we had it all on the table.  If we knew, as the testimony suggested before the Budget Committee  last week, that we really need to appropriate $400 or $500 or $600 billion to  take care of $2 trillion of toxic assets  in banks to get the economy moving  again, we might have less appetite for  lumping an energy bill and an education bill and a health care bill and a  lot of projects that don’t really stimulate the economy in with this borrowed  money.  Finally, on this side of the aisle, just  as on that side of the aisle, we like the  new President. He was our colleague.  He came to see us.

48,Senate,111,0.403,72,2009-02-09,Mr. ISAKSON.," Madam President, I  wish today to honor in the RECORDof  the Senate MAJ Shelia Flowers of the  U.S. Army Reserve on the eve of her  promotion to the rank of lieutenant  colonel.  Although Major Flowers was born  and raised in North Carolina, her dedication to her country has ultimately  lead her to call the State of Georgia  her home as her parent command is the  U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters in Ft. McPherson, GA.  Major Flowers was mobilized in support of Operation Noble Eagle in 2003  and has spent the last 6 years on Active  Duty. In addition to her other tours,  Major Flowers deployed in support of  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  in  2006.  Throughout her Active Duty period,  she has served in the G–1 Directorate  in support of Operation Noble Eagle.  Additionally, Major Flowers was assigned to directly support Operation  Enduring Freedom in November 2007.  In keeping with one of the tenets  that sustains the Reserve Component,  Major Flowers is dedicated to improving her community and the primary  means through which she achieves this  goal is by her membership in the Alpha  Kappa Alpha Sorority, an organization  that recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of its establishment.  In addition  to her  service  to her  country and community, Major Flowers is dedicated to her family. Her husband, LTC Eric Flowers,  shares his  wife’s sense of duty and is currently deployed to the Horn of Africa. Their  daughter, Cheyenne, currently resides  in Atlanta.  I congratulate MAJ Shelia Flowers  for her hard work and much-deserved  promotion to lieutenant colonel, and I  extend to her my sincere gratitude for  her dedication to the defense of our Nation.∑  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting a withdrawal and  sundry nominations which were  referred to the appropriate committees.

49,Senate,111,-0.203,79,2009-02-09,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, if my  colleague will yield for a moment, I  want to mention as we close, I am so  happy and excited about  the President’s nominee for the Small Business  Administration. I had the opportunity  to meet her for the first time today.  I ask my colleague from Maine, who  is actually very  familiar with  this  nominee, and she is from Maine, if the  Senator would share a word or two  about the particular qualifications of  this nominee as we get ready to start  this process. Through the Chair to my  friend from Maine, it is indicative of  the President’s focus and his interest  and his understanding by giving us  such a quality nominee to consider.  ",2009
50,Senate,111,0.091,79,2009-02-09,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I appreciate that Senator LANDRIEUhas raised  for discussion the tremendous credentials that are offered by Karen Mills.  There is no question that she has a tremendous background both in manufacturing and venture capitalism and in  understanding the role that small businesses play in our Nation’s economy.  She has had firsthand experience, not  only through her family’s business endeavors, but also through her work in  venture capitalism in helping to shape  and rebuild various businesses. She understands  and  appreciates  the  resources that are necessary and essential to rebuilding businesses and the  access to capital that is required.  Also, she played a pivotal role  in  Maine’s economy, in encouraging the  use of cluster development. She has  worked extensively with the Brookings  Institute on how to nurture cluster development in various small and rural  communities, to help rebuild and reshape their local economies.  What we have recognized, and what  she has certainly demonstrated time  and again through her own personal  firsthand experience, is that it does not  take a lot of resources to nurture and  create small businesses as a foundation  for a local economy. It is that type of  experience she will bring to the Small  Business Administration.  In  fact,  I had the opportunity to  meet with her this afternoon as she  prepares for the confirmation hearing.  There is no question that she has widespread knowledge on what it will take  to rebuild the Small Business Administration helping it to be far more responsive and receptive to small businesses, to understand what they need,  to link them up with lenders, to provide the technology required to make  the agency much more effective and responsive to the needs of small businesses across the country.  I am  looking  forward  to working  with Ms. Mills and the chair of the  Small Business Committee because I  believe that Ms. Mills is outstanding in  her capabilities and truly appreciates  the role small businesses play in America’s economy. Mr. President,  I ask  unanimous consent  to have a biography  of Ms. Mills  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  BIOGRAPHYOFMS. KARENGORDONMILLS  Ms. Karen Gordon Mills is the President of  MMP Group, Inc. Previously, she was the Co-  Founder and Managing Director at Solera  Capital. Before  founding MMP Group, she  was the Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Industrial Group for E.S.  Jacobs and Co., from December 1983 to January 1993. In this role, Ms. Mills personally led  seven leveraged buyout transactions and had  an influential or board role in six others: Ms.  Mills background  includes  consulting  for  McKinsey and Co. both in the U.S. and in Europe, and working as a Product Manager for  General Foods. She has been a Director and  Member of Audit and Compensation Committees of Arrow Electronics Inc. since 1994 and  Director and Member of its Audit Committee  of ArmorAll Products Inc. since 1994. Ms.  Mills serves as Director of Latina Media  Ventures LLC, Triangle Pacific Corp. since  1988, Annie’s Homegrown Inc., Scotts Company, and Guardian Insurance Company. Ms.  Mills chairs Governor Baldacci’s Council on  Competitiveness and the Economy. She also  sits on the Governor’s Council for the Redevelopment of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, which recently went on the BRAC closure list, and serves on the Boards of the  Maine Technology Institute and the Maine  Nature Conservancy. Ms. Mills is a member  of the Council on Foreign Relations and has  been Vice Chairman of the Harvard Overseers. Ms. Mills has an A.B. in Economics  from Radcliffe College, Magna Cum Laude.  She also holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School where she was a Baker Scholar.  ",2009
51,,111,-0.382,86,2009-02-09,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and legacy of Richard Sklar  . . . Ambassador, engineer, business leader,  innovator, dispute mediator, professor, negotiator’s negotiator, civic leader and public servant, winemaker, NFL  fan,  loyal  friend  to so  many and most importantly, exceedingly proud  husband, father and grandfather.  Dick Sklar passed away of pancreatic cancer at the age of 74 on January 20, 2009, at  his home in San Francisco after watching with  great  satisfaction President Obama’s  Inauguration with his beloved wife Barbara by his  side. Touchingly, his hometown newspaper,  the San Francisco Chronicle noted, ‘‘his death  came  the day after he received  the highest  noncitizen medal of honor from the Republic  of Montenegro, for his role in helping the new  country achieve independence.’’  Dick  is survived by his wife Barbara, his  daughters Pamela Ball  of San Francisco,  Karen Wong King of Santa Rosa, sons Mark  Sklar of Phoenix and Eric Sklar of St. Helena,  eight beautiful grandchildren, son–in–law John  Ball and daughters–in–law Erica and Marilyn  Sklar. Dick was born on November 18, 1943  in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was an engineer and his  family moved often while he  was a young man. He was a graduate of Cornell University earning both a Bachelor’s and  Master’s Degrees in Engineering.  After serving  in  the United States Army,  Dick founded and sold his first business, Allied  Steel and Tractor Corporation, a Cleveland  Ohio based manufacturing company. Cleveland is where he met the love of his life Barbara who is recognized in her own right as a  brilliant artist and a civic leader.  Dick Sklar was a  friend and a mentor  to  many in public service, from Mayors to Governors to Members of Congress to Presidents.  In 1976, Mayor Moscone recruited him to San  Francisco  to oversee  the $1.5 billion sewer  and wastewater treatment plant program and  the  Yerba  Buena Center  known  as  the  Moscone Center. At the time Dick began his  service to the City, it was under a building ban  for non–performance. Senator FEINSTEIN (then  Mayor of San Francisco) appointed him  to  head the Public Utilities Commission. He was  exceptionally successful in these projects and  became known world wide as a leader who  was pragmatic and fair, and who set aside bureaucratic nonsense, challenging those around  him  to  think practically and strive  for excellence and  innovation  in everything  they did.  Dick’s projects consistently came  in under  budget and ahead of schedule.  From 1983 to 1996, Dick served as President of O’Brien Kreitzberg and Associates  (OKA). He developed the first integrated program management system now used industry-  wide to track spending, measure progress and  improve accountability on public construction  projects. During his tenure with OKA, the company built ten airports, light rail lines in major  cities in the U.S. and facilities for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.  In 1996, President Clinton wisely turned to  Dick Sklar for help and appointed him first as  Special Representative  to  the President  in  Bosnia after  the Dayton Peace Accords. He  then appointed him an Ambassador  to  the  United Nations from 1997 to 1999 and lastly  as Special Representative of the President for  the Southeast Europe Initiative from 1999 to  2001. Dick led the postwar economic recovery  effort in the Balkans in coordination with the  World Bank, International Monetary Fund and  the European Union,  focusing on  industries  critical  to establishing a market economy  to  encourage investment.  After five years in Europe, Dick and Barbara  came home to the Bay Area in 2001 and this  time it was the Governor of California, Gray  Davis, who needed his expertise to help with  California’s energy crisis. Dick expedited construction of new power–generating  facilities  and helped keep the lights on for California. In  recent years he consulted with transportation,  engineering and construction  firms  in California and served as an advisor to the Prime  Minister of Montenegro.  Dick Sklar was also known for his love of  fine foods. He knew the menus of great restaurants around the world and could turn out  great culinary delights out of his own kitchen.  Scores of  friends dined at his  table  in San  Francisco, at his beloved home in the vineyard  in Rutherford and at  tables of  restaurants  around the world.  Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of  Representatives to join me in honoring the extraordinary life and accomplishments of Richard Sklar and extend our sympathy to the family he loved so much. His decades of contributions to his community and his country stand  as  lasting  legacies of a  life  lived well. How  privileged I am to have known this magnificent  man and to have had him as one of my dearest friends. He made our world better by contributing  to  it  in unique ways with an unmatched passion for justice, integrity and decency. Those of us who knew him and loved  him will miss him deeply all the days of our  lives, and his life instructs each of us on what  it means to be a true patriot.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

53,,111,-0.297,86,2009-02-09,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Mr. Adam Taliaferro, who grew  up in Voorhees, NJ, for receiving the 2009 Humanitarian Award given by  the Philadelphia  Sports Writers Association. Mr. Taliaferro received this award in recognition of his work in  creating  the  Adam  Taliaferro  Foundation,  which helps athletes who,  like Adam, have  suffered spinal cord injuries. His foundation offers financial, emotional and educational support to student-athletes who experience head  or spinal injuries.  While making a tackle in the fourth quarter  of a game at Ohio State on September 23,  2000, Mr. Taliaferro suffered a severe neck injury. His fifth cervical vertebra, located at the  base of his neck, was fractured and doctors  warned Adam and his  family  that he  likely  would never be able  to walk again. Despite  this dire prognosis, Adam regained the ability  to walk only five months after the injury. Mr.  Taliaferro has used his experience  to  touch  the lives of others who have suffered similar  injuries. He spends time personally responding  to e-mail and phone calls from individuals who  have life-altering disabilities. His encouraging  words,  from someone who knows  from personal experience what it feels like to be seriously injured, mean the world to those on the  other end of the line.  Madam  Speaker,  since  the  injury Mr.  Taliaferro has received his undergraduate degree from Penn State and his JD from Rutgers  School of Law-Camden. He has also created  the Adam Taliaferro Foundation which plays a  vital role in the community, helping those with  serious injuries. Mr. Taliaferro is an excellent  role-model for every American. His ability to  use adversity as the impetus for such a positive contribution  is an example  for us all.  I  congratulate Mr. Taliaferro  for  receiving  the  Humanitarian Award and wish him the best of  luck in his future endeavors.  f  MILLARD FULLER  HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

But, instead, Washington  continues to engage in out-of-control  spending.  There was the $1 trillion ‘‘stimulus  plan’’ that will only stimulate more  government  and more  debt. We’re  about to deal with a half trillion dollar  omnibus spending bill to fund the government for just 7 months, which is an  8 percent  increase  in spending. And  then we have the $75 billion for the  President’s mortgage bailout proposal.  And then he’s going to present to us a  way to cut the deficit, which is going  to be on the backs of our troops. He’s  going to cut spending for our troops.  We need to remind the American people that the number one role of the  Federal Government is the defense of  this Nation. And we need people to understand  that we are putting  these  children,  their  children  and  their  grandchildren into great debt because  Washington will not face up to its responsibility.  f  HONORING LARRY H.

56,House,111,0.647,2,2009-02-23,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, this  week the people of Utah mourned the  passing of a beloved community leader,  entrepreneur and philanthropist. Larry  H. Miller’s life is an inspiration to all  of us who care about families, our communities and our country.  Larry Miller was an extraordinary  businessman, building more  than  80  companies, including his auto business  from one dealership in 1979 to 39 today.  His business holdings expanded with  the 1985 purchase of the Utah Jazz and  later the Salt Lake Bees and the creation of the Miller Motorsports Park.  Perhaps more  important  than his  business  success was his  charitable  work, much of it unseen and anonymous. Through his Larry H. Miller  Charities, Miller provided  for  thousands, funded campus sports facilities,  and established a training center for  entrepreneurs, as well as a facility for  public safety training.  Larry H. Miller had a profound impact upon the State of Utah, and his  works will continue to be a positive  force in countless lives. I honor his accomplishments, his example, his philanthropy, and wish nothing but the  best for his family, and hope they understand  the  deep  gratitude  Utah  shares for a truly honorable man.

57,House,111,0.53,16,2009-02-23,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume  Mr. Speaker, if today someone says  the  word  ‘‘Geronimo,’’  it  evokes  thoughts of an icon of popular culture.  It is unfortunate that in the reality of  this Apache warrior’s  life and death  there is not more interest of the importance for him than simply the pop culture that was developed during World  War II.  It was in fact in 1940, the night before  the first mass jump, that paratroopers  at Fort Benning were watching a 1939  movie named, oddly enough,  ‘‘Geronimo,’’ in which the actor playing this  hero yells his name as he leaps from a  cliff into a river. Thus was born the  phrase that has become known to more  people than the actual life of the Native American leader we call Geronimo.  This resolution notes the treatment  of Geronimo and the Apache people at  the hands of both the Mexican and the  U.S. Governments. It should serve as a  lesson that government is often prone  to error, incompetence and corruption,  and that the larger government grows  in size and power, the more pronounced  and frequent these errors and misdeeds  and mistakes indeed are made.  It should make us shudder to think  in a matter of weeks how this Congress  has spent more than $1 trillion of borrowed money  to grow  the  size and  power  of  the Federal Government.  Today we see problems in this country,  problems of poverty, problems of joblessness, hopefully not a massive increase in homelessness, but sometimes  hopelessness, and that is a sure sign,  and the question is whether big government actually is helping to overcome  those issues or is a hindrance to the  people  in  their ability  to overcome  those particular issues.  This resolution I hope will  inspire  fresh thinking about the direction of  our government with  respect  to all  American citizens, Native Americans  and non-Native Americans alike, and  hopefully will  inspire us to consider  the road we as a country are taking,  and if it is indeed to require greater responsibility  for  individuals,  does  it  help with individuals being able to succeed on their own. That is the course,  that is the question, and I think this  resolution does move us in that direction to ask those kinds of pertinent  questions that are important, not just  for this specific individual, but pertinent for all of us.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
58,House,111,-0.587,44,2009-02-23,Ms. FUDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I will close  with this last unsung hero, Dr. Julian  Earls.  He has been referred to as a Renaissance Man, holding eight university degrees. He earned a bachelor’s degree in  physics from Norfolk State University  in Norfolk, Virginia; a Master’s degree  in radiation biology from the University of Rochester School of Medicine  and Dentistry in Rochester, New York;  and a Doctorate degree  in radiation  physics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He completed the equivalent of the Master’s  degree in environmental health at the  University of Michigan and is a graduate of the Program for Management  Development  at  Harvard  Business  School.  He was awarded the honorary Doctor  of Science degree by the Vaughn College of Aeronautics in New York, the  honorary Doctor of Pedagogy degree by  Nova Southeastern University in Florida, the honorary Doctor of Humane  Letters degree by North Carolina A&T  State University, Norfolk State University, and Wilberforce University in  Ohio.  In January 2006, Dr. Earls retired as  Director of the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration’s Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in Cleveland, Ohio, after a career  spanning  more  than  40 years. As director of  NASA Glenn from 2003 to 2005, he managed a budget in excess of 600 hundred  million and a workforce of over 3,000  employees.  He was responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the activities  required  to accomplish  the  center’s  mission which included research, technology, and systems development programs  in  aeronautical  propulsion,  space propulsion, space power, space  communications,  and  microgravity  sciences in combustion and fluid physics.  He is the author of 30 publications  and has been a distinguished Honors  Visiting Professor at numerous universities.  As a NASA executive, he has received  medals for outstanding leadership, exceptional  achievement,  and  distinguished service. He received the Meritorious Executive Presidential Rank  Award from President William J. Clinton in 1999 and from President George  Bush in 2004.  Dr. Earls has received many humanitarian awards and founded an organization that provides college scholarships  for black students. As a mentor, he has  guided many students through college  and the professions.

For the past 25 years Pat has served the  city of Adel as city clerk. During a city council  meeting, Pat was honored for all her years of  service.

CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  I am reintroducing the ‘‘Whatever It Takes to  Rebuild Act.’’  f  TRIBUTE TO KEN SCHMITT  HON.

61,,111,-0.386,527,2009-02-23,Mrs. MALONEY.," Madam Speaker,  today  I  am reintroducing  the  ‘‘Whatever  it Takes  to  Rebuild Act’’.  A disaster can leave the tax base of an affected community eroded, necessitating Federal assistance to pay for essential services.  These essential services, including police, fire,  and school personnel, are even more critical  in the wake of a disaster. To aid communities,  Congress  created  the Community Disaster  Loan Program. While this program has worked  with great success, there are two significant  issues that need to be fixed. The first issue is  that this assistance is delivered in the form of  a loan and the second is that any loan is limited to $5 million. Providing this aid as a loan  can further delay the recovery of a local community and the $5 million cap does not allow  for adequate assistance for medium or large  communities.  The  ‘‘Whatever  It Takes  to Rebuild Act’’  would repeal the requirement that disaster affected communities epay the assistance they  receive under  the Community Disaster Loan  Program. This  legislation would permanently  repeal  the $5 million cap on  these  loans,  would make states eligible for this assistance,  repeal the cap that limits loans to 25 percent  of a municipalities operating expenses, and  would provide this assistance as grants when  the President waives the provisions for a catastrophic event. All of  these provisions are  aimed at giving the Federal Government the  tools and flexibility we need to fully respond  following a disaster.  This program was used most recently immediately following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. While it was able to provide significant  benefits, repayment requirements have raised  significant hurdles for many recipient communities. In the wake of a disaster, the government should give American communities the  financial assistance they need to get back on  their feet with no strings attached. That is why  HON.

62,,111,0.414,534,2009-02-23,Mr. PUTNAM.," Madam Speaker, on January  27, 2009, I introduced H.R. 728, the Seniors’  Tax Simplification Act,  legislation  that would  allow our nation’s senior citizens to file their  federal income taxes on a new and simplified  Form 1040S. This new  form would capture  sources of income commonly reported by seniors, including social security benefits, distributions from qualified retirement plans, annuities  or other deferred payment arrangements, interest and dividends, and capital gains and  losses.  Currently,  individuals who are age 65 or  over are prohibited from using Form 1040EZ.  Seniors  that do not qualify  for  the shorter  Form 1040A,  fill out a  longer, more complicated Form 1040 that deals with schedules,  and includes much that is simply not pertinent  to seniors’ taxable situations.  In  2004,  the House  of Representatives  unanimously passed legislation by a recorded  vote  to create Form 1040S. However,  the  Senate failed to consider the legislation and  the IRS has since halted their efforts to develop such a form even though their estimates  showed  that as many as 11 million seniors  could benefit from such a simplified tax form  in the first year it is made available.  The U.S. Census Bureau projects in 2030,  when all of the baby boomers will be 65 and  over, that nearly one in five U.S. residents is  expected to be 65 and older. This age group  is projected to increase to 88.5 million in 2050,  more than doubling the number in 2008, which  was 38.7 million.  Further, in Florida alone, the 65 and over  population  represent over 3.3 million  residents—that’s 17.4 percent of the state’s total  population. Recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau project  this population will only  continue to grow. By 2025, Florida’s 65 and  over population is projected to reach close to  5.5 million residents. This represents a 107.3  percent increase from 1995 to 2025.  The 60 Plus Association has also endorsed  this  important  legislation stating  the  ‘‘senior-  friendly proposal would dramatically simplify  the federal income tax filing process for millions of our nation’s senior citizens.’’  It is clear that millions stand to benefit from  the Seniors’ Tax Simplification Act, and countless hours of time and energy could be saved  not fretting over complex and often confusing  tax forms. I encourage my colleagues to support our nation’s seniors and cosponsor this  long overdue legislation.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.

64,House,111,0.513,5,2009-03-06,Mr. BOEHNER.," Let me thank my  colleague for yielding and suggest that  this continuing resolution we have on  the floor today shouldn’t be for the  next 4 or 5 days; it really ought to be  through the end of this  fiscal year,  which is September 30th of this year.  I know there are a lot of Members  that have a lot of other issues that  they would like to include in this, but  the fact is that American families are  hurting, small businesses are hurting  around the country, our economy  is  hurting, and I think we can help our  economy and we can send a strong signal to the American people by extending this spending freeze through September 30th.  Let’s show the American taxpayers  that we get it. Let’s show investors in  our American economy that we get it.  Because clearly the bill that has been  under consideration both here in the  House and now in the Senate has a $30  billion increase over last year’s spending and includes nearly 9,000 earmarks,  and the way to put all of this to a stop  is to just have a spending freeze. Let’s  show the American people we understand the pain that they are under and  show them that we are willing to tighten our belt.  So when we have our opportunity to  offer our motion to recommit at the  end of this process, there will be an extension  of  that  date  through September 30th, with some increases for  those  in police departments and the  FBI and other law enforcement jurisdictions, and  it  is something that I  think is a responsible way forward. I  would encourage my colleagues to support the motion to recommit.  ",2009
65,House,111,0.478,5,2009-03-06,Mr. DREIER.," Madam  Speaker,  thank my friend for yielding.  To  paraphrase  the  late Admiral  James Stockdale from his famous vice  presidential debate of nearly 17 years  ago, why are we here?  I don’t quite get this. I know there  will be some who want to blame George  Bush  or  any  other Republican  out  there, but the fact of the matter is, for  the first time in a long time, we have  a Democratic President, a Democratic  House of Representatives and a Democratic United States Senate, and yet  we at this moment are dealing with the  possibility of a government shutdown.  I just don’t quite comprehend this.  The American people, as our Republican  leader and my California colleague,  the  distinguished  ranking  member of the committee, have said,  the American people are hurting. We  know very well with the unemployment rate that just came through it  today at 8.5 percent, a one-half percent  increase over 8 percent, that there are  a lot of people who are suffering. We  know of individual stories, and I have  got to tell you the most painful one for  me was to hear of the father of three  young teenagers who committed suicide out in California over this.  So, we have a very, very difficult  challenge ahead of us, and yet we are  sitting here dealing with this issue and  a massive increase in spending, which  clearly the American people do not  want. It is a policy that has failed. It  failed throughout the 1930s.  We know what needs to be done,  Madam Speaker, for us to get our economy back on track. What we need to do  is we need to follow the model that was  put  forward by John F. Kennedy  in  1961, the model of Ronald Reagan in  1981, because those solutions have in  fact succeeded in the past. And yet we  know that massive increases in spending, as  the  rest of  the world has  learned, are not the answer for the future.  I strongly support our effort to keep  this spending as low as possible by supporting our motion to recommit.  ",2009
66,House,111,0.655,5,2009-03-06,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, we  come to this well at a very difficult  time in the life of our Nation. American families are struggling under the  weight of this recession. Millions of  Americans are watching as their life  savings are evaporating before their  eyes. My own family has been touched  by the hardship in the housing crisis  and by job loss. So I come to this floor  with a sense of urgency, and it is a  sense of urgency that was confirmed  this morning with the jobs report and a  startling reality.  But in the midst of these very difficult times, the American people are  rising to the occasion. As we speak in  this well  this morning, millions of  Americans are doing  in  their  small  businesses, in their family farms and  around their kitchen tables what this  Congress should be doing. They are  finding places to save. They are putting off expenditures that they don’t  have to make this year to make sure  they make ends meet for the priorities  in their lives.  Yet this Congress, by this massive  omnibus bill, is going on with spending  as usual. An 8 percent increase in Federal spending, the largest increase in a  single year since I was in high school  in the 1970s, apart from those months  following September 11th, is not what  the American people expect to see this  Congress doing.  ‘‘Spending as usual’’ with thousands  upon thousands of earmarks and special projects is not what the American  people expect from this Congress during  these  difficult  times. Madam  Speaker, they want to see the Congress  doing what they are doing, and that is  making  careful decisions, practicing  fiscal  discipline  and  setting  aside  ‘‘business as usual’’ to confront these  challenging times.  b1100  And so I rise today to say, let’s not  just do this continuing resolution for a  week but, as others have said, for the  rest of this year, let’s freeze Federal  spending in virtually every area of the  government. Let’s say no earmarks in  the Year 2009.  And it’s not a value judgment on the  Members who’ve made those project requests. I, myself, don’t request projects  of that nature. But it is to say, Madam  Speaker, that in these difficult times,  we have to do what every American  family, every small business owner and  every family farmer is doing, and that  is making sacrifices and practicing discipline.  I urge my colleagues in both parties  to  join  the minority  today  in  supporting our motion to recommit. It’s a  motion that would essentially  freeze  all Federal spending, say to historic increases in spending in these difficult  times, no to earmarks, and say yes to  the practiced values of millions of  Americans in these difficult days.

There may  be money for tattoo removal in the omnibus bill, but it won’t be easy to remove the tattoo that comes with signing a bill like this, with nearly 9,000  earmarks contained in it.

I have got a chart here, and this  chart  shows  the money  supply.  It’s  hard for people to see back in their offices, but this is the money supply, and  it’s been pretty consistent all the way  up through maybe 1995, and since then  it started to rise. That’s the amount of  money we print and is in circulation.  Just after the 2007 time period, it shot  straight up. It’s going up like a rocket.  Now, what does that mean? It means  right now we have created currency in  this country that’s almost 300 percent  of what it was just a year or two ago.  So people say what difference does that  make?

Mr. Sherman has given  unprecedented service  to Local 2150 of  the  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  and during his tenure has served as Business  Representative, Assistant Business Manager,  and Business Manager for Local 2150.  Since 1987, Mr. Sherman has been a member of  the State AFL–CIO Executive Board  where his  leadership has  led  to greater cooperation within organized  labor, and  forged  stronger  relationships with  local, state, and  federal officials on the importance of issues affecting working families. Mr. Sherman served  on the Missouri Valley Board of Trustees that  contributed  to strong  labor-management  regarding  industry performance,  training and  safety issues.  Mr. Sherman  is a veteran having proudly  served as a United States Marine. He is also  a devoted family man, who together with his  wife, Chris, has raised four children and has  been blessed with seven grandchildren.  On March 13, 2009, Dan Sherman will be  recognized and thanked for his many contributions to the citizens of Wisconsin and all of  Wisconsin by family, friends and colleagues.  In fact, Mr. Sherman continues to set a strong  example to us all by displaying humor, grace  and goodwill to all, in spite of extreme challenges to his own health.  Madam Speaker,  for  these reasons,  I am  honored to pay tribute to Mr. Dan Sherman for  his contributions to the Fourth Congressional  District and  the State of Wisconsin.

75,,111,0.513,1,2009-03-17,Mr. BOEHNER.," I welcome my colleagues to St. Patrick’s Day and I hope  everyone has a happy one.  Madam Speaker, we are 2 months  into this Congress, and Washington has  done nothing  to ease  the economic  challenges facing middle class families  and small businesses.  We’ve watched  the  administration  approve another $350 billion for more  bailouts for the financial industry, and  we’ve watched passage of a trillion-dollar  ‘‘stimulus’’ bill, and  then we’ve  watched the passage of a $410 billion  omnibus bill  loaded with some 9,000  unscrutinized earmarks.  Soon we are going  to debate  the  President’s  budget,  a  budget which  spends too much, taxes too much, and  borrows too much from our kids and  our grandkids. This budget raises taxes  on everyone, from middle class families  to small businesses, to seniors and to  schools. It even punishes anyone who  would have the audacity to flip on a  light switch thanks to a brand new $646  billion energy  tax. This means  less  money in the family budget and more  jobs being shipped overseas.  The American people are looking for  real  solutions  that will help create  jobs, rebuild savings, and create more  investment  in our economy. And  in  spite of what some disingenuous political operatives are saying, Republicans  are offering better solutions.  So  far  this year, we’ve presented  clear, superior alternatives to Washington Democrats’  flawed proposals.  We’ve asked the administration for an  exit strategy to get the government  back out of the private sector and get  taxpayers off the hook for more billions in handouts to the financial sector. Our whip, ERICCANTOR, and I personally delivered to the President an  economic recovery plan that would create twice as many jobs as the Democrats’ plan at half the cost. And we  fought for a spending freeze as the majority fought for their bloated $410 billion omnibus spending bill.  Listen, the American people are fed  up with what they’re seeing here in  Washington. Don’t  they  deserve  to  keep more of what they earn as we try  to get this economy back on track?  Don’t  they deserve better  solutions  than the spending, taxing, and borrowing that they’re seeing out of this  Congress?  Republicans are offering better solutions, and we hope the majority will  join us.  THE CONTINUED NEED FOR  HEALTH REFORM  ",2009

Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  speak on an issue that continues to be  a top priority for American families  and businesses, one that is fundamentally intertwined with the strength of  our Nation’s economy and the government’s long-term fiscal sustainability.  I’m speaking, of course, about the need  for health care reform.  Health  care  costs  in  the United  States are rising at an alarming rate.  Yet despite the  fact that we spend  more per capita on health care than  any other  industrialized country, we  produce some of the worst outcomes by  a number of important health measures. Furthermore, the U.S. remains  the only developed nation that does  not guarantee health coverage as a  right to its citizens.  Recent estimates indicate that over  45 million Americans lack health insurance, leaving one in six without access to proper medical care. Even more  shocking is that over 80 percent of the  uninsured come from working families.  Health care costs are imposing an increasing burden on families and placing employers at a further competitive  disadvantage in our global economy.  Now, as we seek to unfurl the complex economic challenges  facing our  country, it remains abundantly clear  that our success will not only depend  on our ability to stem housing foreclosures and create new jobs; it will  also depend on our will to change a system of health care that is fundamentally  flawed  and under  tremendous  strain.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

President Obama and this Congress are committed to real change. And what  is  that change? We propose solutions, real  solutions. An honest budget, rejecting  gimmicks, and eliminating the wasteful spending that has brought us to this  trillion dollar deficit that we now have  today.  What the American people need are  tax cuts, and 95 percent of Americans  will now receive a tax cut. What do the  American people need? A double commitment of  the  investment of Pell  grants, of looking at a commitment to  Head Start, and so many of the other  vital areas.  When we look at this Congress, we  are committed to fixing health care,  not to be a party of ‘‘no,’’ but to say  that we are going to address what is  happening for struggling homeowners.  The American Recovery Act  addressed and is helping us to bring forward 3.5 million jobs to help stabilize  the State budgets and to dig us out of  this fiscal mess that we inherited over  the last 8 years.  We can recover, we must recover, because as Americans, failure is not an  option.  above-type person. We need a diversity  of energy sources. But we will not be  carbon free for generations. Our need  for plastics, fertilizers, lubricants, and  fuels so dictates.  So given  the  fact  that we’re not  going to be carbon free, it seems like  domestic energy production should be  encouraged. If we’ve got to have something, it’s better for us to buy it from  ourselves,  for our workers,  for  the  money to stay here.  In Louisiana alone, my home State,  oil and gas production in the petrochemical industry employs 320,000 people. They work as welders, pipe-fitters,  on barges, engineers. Countless small  businesses with another 100,000 or so  workers. Yet the President’s budget  contains at  least eight separate tax  hikes specifically targeting domestic  oil and gas production.  Tax hikes create uncertainty, uncertainty creates caution, and caution inhibits economic activity. As we seek  energy security and to create and preserve American jobs, I have to ask why  are we punishing the industry which  contributes both?  ",2009
78,House,111,0.36,8,2009-03-17,Mr. BUCHANAN.," Mr. Speaker, the  American people were outraged yesterday, and with good reason, when they  learned that the bonuses of $165 million  were going to executives at AIG, an insurance company. They are the very  executives who drove the company to  the ground and helped create the economic problems we’re facing today. Instead of getting bonuses, they should  be fired.  AIG is now 80 percent owned by the  Federal Government, which  is  the  American people. This is an outrageous  injustice at taxpayers’ expense.  I have been in business 30 years. We  always pay for results, proven results,  in this case something that would be a  return to the American people. But  that hasn’t happened. This  rewards  greed and recklessness.  AIG  recently  reported  in  a  2008  fourth quarter more than $60 billion in  losses, all while the unemployment in  America hit a 25-year high.  I ask the President to use all the  power at his disposal to prevent these  bonuses from being paid at taxpayers’  expense.  f  f  FORMER  VICE  PRESIDENT  CHENEY’S  ATTEMPT  TO  REWRITE  HISTORY  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
79,House,111,-0.379,8,2009-03-17,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker,  on  Sunday former Vice President Cheney  made the  latest  in a series of outrageous attempts to rewrite history.  He suggested that America was  less  safe now than under President Bush.  Well, as a former journalist and editor,  I’m compelled to do a little rewrite of  his story.  I think it is important to note that  under President Bush and Vice President Cheney, we let Osama bin Laden  escape. We took our eye off the ball in  Afghanistan and moved to  Iraq. We  went into Iraq with no plan for victory.  We heard from Vice President Cheney  that we were going to be greeted as liberators, that WMD would certainly be  found, and that this war was going to  be very short and cost us very little  money.  My editing of Vice President Cheney’s statement on Sunday would be  that he did not exactly tell the whole  story.  Fortunately,  the American  people  know the whole story. They know that  we are much safer now with President  Obama in the White House. So as the  recently departed Paul Harvey would  have said, ‘‘And now you know the rest  of the story.’’  f  CALLING FOR  100 PERCENT TAX  ON  ‘‘PERFORMANCE’’  BONUSES  BY ANY COMPANY IN WHICH THE  GOVERNMENT OWNS A MAJORITY STAKE  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
80,House,111,-0.386,8,2009-03-17,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, we all  know the news yesterday that AIG is  paying over $100 million in bonuses. I  find this an absolute outrage. I’m glad  the President has directed the Treasury Department to use all legal means  to restrict these bonuses.  But we  in Congress  can actually  make the laws, and here’s a law we  should make: Tax the bonuses of any  company  in which  the  government  owns a majority stake at 100 percent. I  have introduced this bill today—tax so-  called  ‘‘performance’’ bonuses at 100  percent.  Bonuses are supposed to be given to  someone who has done a good job. But  AIG, as my colleague said, and we’ve  found something we agree on, lost over  $70 billion in the last quarter. We put  in $170 billion of taxpayers’ money.  They don’t deserve a bonus. They deserve better management. They deserve certainly a restriction on the bonuses that they have. And I really applaud President Obama, who said yesterday that this isn’t just a matter of  dollars and cents; it’s a matter of fundamental values.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  taxing this bonus.  f  ENERGY  (Mr. CASSIDY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009

I want to yield to  my  friend  from South Dakota  (Ms.  HERSETHSANDLIN) for 2 minutes.  MS.  HERSETH  SANDLIN.  Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Missouri for yielding. I rise in strong  support of House Resolution 211, a resolution Supporting the Goals and Ideals  of National Women’s History Month.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this  resolution, along with many of my colleagues, and would like to thank Congresswoman WOOLSEY for introducing  this legislation, recognizing the critical role women have played in shaping  the Nation we are proud to call home  today.  Women like the pioneers who helped  settle the great plains in the West, the  women  who  were  the  suffragettes  working to ensure women’s right to  vote, the role of so many women on the  home front and abroad throughout our  Nation’s history and serving  in our  Armed Forces, the important and positive  influence of women across  the  country  in the workplace,  in public  service, and throughout our communities.  Although we have certainly come a  long way in ensuring equal treatment  of women, challenges do remain.  In  recognition of the need to address the  obstacles women still face, President  Obama signed an executive order recently, creating the White House Council on Women and Girls, and I was honored to participate in the signing ceremony at the White House.  Given the number of working mothers in South Dakota, one of the highest  numbers per capita in the country, and  having  recently  become  a working  mother myself, I will be particularly  interested in this new council’s focus  on this aspect of women and families. I  am proud of the progress we have made  to integrate the stories of heroic American women into the discussion of our  Nation’s history. I encourage schools  and organizations across the country  to participate in the celebration of National Women’s History Month and  make their own unique contribution to  the ongoing narrative of the history of  women in America.  I would like to thank again Congresswoman WOOLSEY for introducing this  important resolution. I thank her for  her leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution.  ",2009
83,House,111,-0.299,15,2009-03-17,Ms. TITUS.," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.  Today I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 211 and National Women’s History  Month, which  this  year  celebrates  women who are taking the lead to save  our planet. Women have played a critical role in the fight to protect the  Earth as activists, scientists and public  servants. In Nevada, many of the early  environmental  activists,  like  Tina  Nappe, were women inspired to act by  their  childhood  experiences  in  the  beautiful Silver State. They have been  joined by respected scientists, such as  Dr. Peg Rees, dedicated to finding new  ways to protect the desert for future  generations.  As public servants, women have also  made a significant contribution to saving our planet. In the Nevada legislature, for example, our women members  have been ahead of their time, championing issues from renewable energy  development,  like Sheila Leslie,  to  smart growth, like Chris Giunchigliani.  These  many  accomplishments  are  being documented, analyzed and disseminated to the public by the Women’s Research Institute at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas under the  able direction of Dr. Joanne Goodwin.  But Women’s History Month is not  only a month of remembrance of the  important women of our past. It is an  inspiration for the next generation of  women and a call for them to continue  the fight to leave this precious rock a  better place to our children than we  found it. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman,  and thank you especially, Ms. WOOLSEY, for offering this important resolution that commemorates the 22nd anniversary of National Women’s History  Month.  ",2009

Because I think that if we  really are being for real about tackling  this, we have got to do it, and we have  got to require what this bill requires in  our prisons.  WATERS,  I just have to say today, on behalf of  my constituents, where we declared a  state of emergency in 1999 in the African American community in Alameda  County, on behalf of the entire country, thank you very much. It is a very  hopeful day.  I urge support of this bill, and look  forward to our continuing work and  getting it to President Obama’s desk so  he can sign this into law.  ",2009
86,House,111,0.414,36,2009-03-17,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker,  I come this afternoon to the House of  Representatives  to bring a message  from Kansans and those who support  the Second Amendment.  The United States Supreme Court  ruled last year that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right  to own firearms and that Washington  DC’s gun ban is unconstitutional. This  decision was a win for all Americans  and sent a message to governments  across the country in support of Second Amendment freedoms.  Unfortunately  in  recent weeks we  have heard from administration officials and gun control advocates that  they are pushing to restrict an individual’s gun rights, the rights guaranteed  by our Constitution. Discussing escalating violence caused by drug cartels  in Mexico, U.S. Attorney General Eric  Holder  last month  called  for  reinstating the so-called assault weapons  ban.  This is the wrong approach. Instead  of punishing law-abiding American gun  owners,  our  citizens,  our  country  should be working to enforce existing  gun laws that outlaw illegal purchases.  We should secure our borders, and we  should work to increase the cooperation between the United States and  Mexican authorities.  Many Kansans are also concerned  about H.R. 45, legislation that has been  proposed to  license gun owners and  track firearms sales. I am hopeful that  this bill does not have the support to  be approved by this Congress.  An article in today’s Wichita Eagle,  our newspaper at home, highlights an  ironic twist. The article reports that  news of gun control efforts, along with  concerns that crime will increase with  a troubled economy, has ramped up the  demand for firearms and ammunitions.  Shortages are now common as retail  stores are having trouble keeping guns  and ammunition on the shelves.  I want to restate that our Founding  Fathers established a Bill of Rights to  our Constitution to make sure that  American citizens can live in freedom  without government intrusion. Human  liberty and  limited government are  principles I hold in high regard.  I stand with Kansans in opposing efforts that violate the Second Amendment, and I will continue to cast my  votes where it’s necessary to protect  our rights, including those provided for  by the Second Amendment.  f  ",2009
87,House,111,-0.037,36,2009-03-17,Mr. KRATOVIL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the 290th Military Police Company of Adelphi, Maryland.  Earlier this month I had the honor of  attending a welcome home ceremony  for the soldiers.  In June of 1948, the ‘‘Defenders’’ received their original Federal recognition and were activated several times  during the 1960s and 1970s to quell civil  disturbance  in Cambridge, Salisbury  and Baltimore, Maryland. In 1990, the  290th was mobilized both in support of  Operation Desert Shield and of Desert  Storm.  On September 11, the 290th was again  called to service to secure the crash  site at the Pentagon while rescue and  recovery operations took place. From  there, the 290th was mobilized under  Operation Noble Eagle  for homeland  defense.  The 290th was again called upon to  help support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. During the mission, the 290th provided force protection for key air bases, including those  in Pakistan.  In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf region, once again the  290th was sent to Mississippi to assist  local law enforcement with emergency  and relief operations. And, again, in  October 2007, the 290th was once again  mobilized and deployed in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom. This is a unit  that has been asked to serve our Nation all over the world and right here  at home, and each time  it has responded to the call of duty valiantly  and honorably. But now, deservedly,  they are home.  Our Nation’s greatest strength is the  men and women who selflessly give of  themselves to defend our ideals, and  their  families, who make  sacrifices  every day while their loved ones are in  harm’s way. I salute the 290th military  police  company  and welcome  them  home, and pledge to be an advocate for  them and all veterans of our Armed  Forces.  Celebrating the valor of our Armed  Forces is one thing, but here in Congress we must put our money where  our mouth is and support the men and  women of our Armed Forces, their families and our veterans, or we are merely  providing lip service to them.

88,House,111,0.494,36,2009-03-17,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  while I was running for Congress last  year, I noticed that Democrats everywhere were campaigning on the notion  that they were fiscally responsible and  would make wise decisions  for our  country based on what we could afford.  Frankly, as  the  former mayor of  Johnson  City, Tennessee, who  has  grown accustomed to balanced budgets  and  living within  our means,  this  sounded pretty good. It made me excited to come to Washington and get  our financial house in order.  My excitement, however, was short  lived when I realized how thoughtlessly  we would spend a billion dollars. First  we approved the second $350 billion of  the Troubled Asset Relief Program,  which is what people back home and I  call a bailout of our banking institutions. Then we approved $787 billion for  what was called economic  stimulus,  but what was in reality a laundry list  of  spending  items  the  Democrats  hadn’t been able to get funded the past  few years and won’t produce sustainable economic growth.  Just when I thought things couldn’t  get worse, we went out and passed a  fiscal year 2009 omnibus spending bill  that included $410 billion and an 8 percent increase for our Federal agencies.  I am going to pause for a second and  let that sink in, an 8 percent increase  at a time of record deficits where local  county, city and State governments  are cutting and balancing budgets.

And I do that  right before I yield to the real American leader on the Fair Tax, an individual whom I met when I was a State  legislator at an American Legislative  Exchange Council meeting, and I heard  from JOHNLINDER in that meeting. I  had no idea at the time I was going to  get to be his colleague, and I had no  idea at the time I would be able to  yield some time to our national leader  on the Fair Tax, ",2009
90,House,111,0.559,43,2009-03-17,Mr. LINDER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding and  for organizing this  Special Order.  I think it might be good right now to  repeat what the Fair Tax is.  The Fair Tax would repeal all taxes  on income. No more corporate income  tax, personal income tax, no more payroll tax. Most Americans pay more in  payroll taxes than income taxes. That  pays for Social Security and Medicare.  We would get rid of the gift tax, the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax.  No more tax on income at all. And instead, we would tax a national sales  tax on everything that you purchased.  On average today, the average  income American gives the government  33 cents out of every dollar he earns.  Under the Fair Tax, they would give  the government 23 cents out of every  dollar they spend and raise the same  amount of money.  Now we are going to come to this  point  because  economic  forces  are  going to drive us to this point. I had  the privilege of visiting with Chairman  Bernanke last week or 10 days ago or  so. One day, whether I am here or not,  this Congress is going to decide the  only way to go is to a more fair tax,  that taxes not what you put into society, but what you take out.  Today we know that on average, 22  percent of what you pay for is the embedded cost to the IRS. With all of the  companies that it takes to get a loaf of  bread to your table, there are payroll  taxes, income taxes, there are compliance costs, they get embedded in that  price system. That is the only way a  business can pay a bill is through price.  And you pay that business’ light bill,  their rent, and their tax bill.  If we have a price system that is inflated by 22 percent because of the embedded cost of the IRS, that makes us  less than competitive in a global economy and jobs move into better tax jurisdictions offshore.  Secondly, the Tax Foundation said  that last year we spent $350 billion filling out IRS paperwork. We spend another $125 billion a year calculating the  tax implications of a business decision.  If we are spending in excess of $450 billion a year just to fill out forms to  send them in, that is inefficient. That  is stupid. It is like paying for a dead  horse. You get nothing from the transaction.  Third, the underground economy is  about $2 trillion a year. And the more  complex our code gets, the easier it is  to go underground and avoid paying  taxes. They are not contributing.  Fourth, there is today in offshore financial centers in dollar-denominated  deposits $13 trillion. My point to Chairman Bernanke was this: that is money  that would be on shore in our markets,  in our banks, if we didn’t have an IRS.  All four of those issues: the embedded  costs, the compliance costs, the underground economy, and the offshore investments, would be eliminated and  fixed by getting rid of the IRS. None of  them will  be  touched  by  nibbling  around the edges of our current tax  system.  Fifth is this point. We are having a  serious problem starting in real estate  in America because people can’t afford  to pay their mortgages. Some made  bad choices, but that is a simple fact.  Under the Fair Tax the average income  earner would have a 50 percent increase  in  take-home pay. They would pay  their mortgages. Now all of this stuff  gets  fixed  in  the  economy without  spending $700 billion here and $700 billion there without raising taxes and everything, as Mr. MICAsaid.  Lastly,  this point: we have never  taxed wealth in America; we tax wages.  The first thing very wealthy people do  is stop getting wages so they pay 15  percent on capital gains and dividends,  and if the Obama plan goes through,  they will pay a 20 percent tax. But they  don’t pay anything to Social Security  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:30 Mar 18, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17MR7.086 H17MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
91,House,111,-0.428,57,2009-03-17,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker,  I enjoyed  listening to my colleague  from Illinois. In fact, this is the second  time today I have heard him speak on  the floor and I have seen him point to  the picture of the coal miners and talk  about the problems of the Clean Air  Act. And I hope every American was  listening to that because that is exactly what we are talking about today.  We had, for decades, people burning  dirty coal, turning rivers and lakes in  other parts of the country, acid rain,  destroying forests, posing problems to  people’s health. And what this Congress did, in a bipartisan effort, was  create a mechanism to make it so that  it was no longer free to pollute the air  with dirty coal that created acid rain  and destroyed lakes and forests.  My friend didn’t want to talk about  the problems to health, didn’t want to  talk about the issues that relate to the  damage to the environment, or the fact  that we were able to create the most  effective market  system  in history  that was able to solve a real problem to  the environment, to health. Life went  on. Yes, there were some changes in  terms of  the  economy. There were  some people who didn’t—when it became too expensive for them to foul  the air, spoil our lakes, and destroy our  forests, then they shifted. Well, I would  suggest, Madam Speaker,  that  any  independent  observer would  suggest  that that was a solid program and a  good tradeoff.  I don’t hear my friend from Illinois  coming to the floor and saying, repeal  the Clean Air Act so we can have a few  more miners at work creating dirty  coal that is going to ruin our environment and destroy health. That issue is  over.  We are facing a very real challenge  today about what we are going to do to  protect the future of the planet. I will  get into, in a moment, talking about  some of the discussion that we have  heard from our friends on the other  side of the aisle, but one of the things  that is very, very important to note is  that they have no answer in terms of  what we do to the slow cooking of the  planet. They ignore the costs that are  being incurred right this minute. Temperatures in Alaska have already gone  up several degrees, permafrost  is no  longer permanent, roads are buckling,  coastal villages washed away. These  are costs and consequences that we are  already seeing as the ocean levels slowly, imperceptibly to most of us, but  very clear to scientists when they see  the fabled Inland Passage in the Arctic  Ocean free of ice, when we watch the  habitat shrink for arctic animals, when  we watch diseases shifting from vector  control—West Nile  disease,  for  instance, popping up in places where it  shouldn’t be, where invasive species are  infesting our forests. These are costs  and consequences that we are seeing  now that my friends on the other side  of the aisle refuse to come to grips  with.  But we are not going to be able to  have the same head-in-the-sand attitude that we saw from the Bush administration alone—of all the major governments in the world, alone—denying  the  imperative  of  global warming,  withdrawing from opportunities to be  collaborative on a national scale.  b1915  What we had to have in the last 8  years, where the other side of the aisle  simply accepted that sort of behavior  from their administration and, in fact,  aided and abetted and supported it, we  had over 900 cities across the country  come forward and say wait a minute,  we’re not going to wait for the Bush  administration and the Federal Government. We are going to take it upon  ourselves to deal with climate change  and  global warming  and move  to  change our local economy, to prepare  it for the future, and to help slow this  damage to the environment by carbon  pollution.  I come from a community in Portland, Oregon, where we have actually  reduced greenhouse gas emissions for 4  years  in a row. We’re very close to  being Kyoto compliant. It gave us an  opportunity,  frankly,  to create new  green  jobs. We were competing with  Houston and Denver for being the wind  energy capital of the United States because we’ve been serious about energy  conservation,  transportation  choices,  land use, all of the things that are  going to be part of a comprehensive solution to the threat of these changes to  the climate and the carbon pollution.  We’ve actually been able to make some  progress and be positioned to deal with  a carbon-constrained economy.  We need, Madam Speaker, for people  to reflect on what is happening now.  Just like my friend from Illinois didn’t  talk about the cost of acid rain. It  didn’t matter to him. He was concerned  about a few miners in his district and  didn’t care about the damage to forests  and human health and lakes and fishing. But we are already seeing the damage that is occurring as a result of climate change.  Speaking of acid rain, one of the  things we are seeing is that the ocean  is  slowly becoming more and more  acidic. This increased acidic content of  the ocean is having a consequence in  terms of damaging coral reefs. I mean  these are the rain forests of the ocean.  This is where billions and billions of  different animals and plants reside up  the food chain throughout the ecological system of the ocean that makes a  difference in terms of how people on  this planet are going to be fed. We are  watching what has happened. There  may be consequences in terms of the  Earth’s climate because of the change  in the ocean’s current and acidic level.  We are seeing across the country increases in extreme weather events, exactly what the scientists told us would  happen. Yes, the world’s atmosphere is  increasing in temperature. Yes, we’re  seeing an increase in the sea level that  could be 2 to 6 feet by the end of the  next century. But we are already seeing vast stretches of this country in  the flame zone being subjected to increased forest fires, to drought. In your  areas in the Southeast, you have seen  drought where it has not been a problem for years. In the Southwest, Lake  Mead that supplies the city of Las  Vegas is going down, causing massive  disruption. We are watching changes  that are  taking place  in  terms of  snowpack. My good  friend and colleague from the Pacific Northwest, Mr.  INSLEE, and I depend on snowpack for  water supply and energy production.  This makes a great deal of difference.  Madam Speaker, one of the concerns  I have as I am listening to our friends  on the other side of the aisle make  things up about what is going to happen with a proposal to reduce carbon  pollution and put a price on it, they assume somehow that this is going to result in money disappearing, that somehow this is just a tax that goes into the  great government maw and there  is  nothing that comes out the other end.  Well, as a practical matter, and I’m  confident that  in the course of this  hour as I work with my friend Mr. INSLEE, who I see poised here in the front  of the Chamber and I am hoping that  he’s willing to enter into this conversation with me because he knows a great  deal about it, we hope that we will be  able to encourage, if not our Republican  friends, at  least the American  people to look at the President’s budget. Look at what he has proposed to  begin a  comprehensive approach  to  transform our energy supply and slow  global warming.  Yes, he recommends putting a price  on carbon pollution, but he also recommends that this money would be  generated by having the carbon polluters pay for the privilege, just like  we did with acid rain so successfully  that my  friend  from Illinois now  is  against. There are opportunities to be  able to put this back into place because  the program, and I’m just quoting from  the President’s budget, would be implemented through a cap and trade, like  we did with acid rain, that will ensure  that the biggest polluters don’t enjoy a  windfall. The program will fund vital  investments in a clean energy future,  which I think my friend Mr. INSLEE  may have some thoughts about, $150  billion over the course of the next 10  years. The balance of the auction revenues are to be returned to the people,  especially vulnerable families, communities, and business, to help the transition to the clean energy economy.  You know, there’s a great NRDC blog  that talks about Newt Gingrich’s assertion that climate change will result in  a $1,300 tax per household. And they  point out it’s simply voodoo economics.  First of all, he ignores the value of  the carbon market. It just disappears.

92,House,111,0.467,64,2009-03-17,Mr. CARTER.," Let me point out, I  have a poster board here. Now some  might think I have been picking on  Chairman RANGEL too much, and  I  don’t intend to do that, but this is to  make my point. Chairman RANGELis in  charge of taxation. That is his job. He  is the tax man of this House.  We have a little quote here from a  real conservative news source we all  love and adore, the New York Times,  January 3, 2009, ‘‘Rangel Pushed for a  Donation;  Insurer Pushed  for a Tax  Cut.’’  It  is  written  by  David  Kocieniewski. ‘‘On April 21, 2008, Representative Charles B. Rangel met with  officials of the American International  Group,  the  now-troubled  insurance  giant, to ask for a donation to a school  of public service that City College of  New York was building in his honor,’’  and I will point out named after him.  ‘‘Mr. Rangel had already helped secure a $5 million pledge for the project  from a foundation controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg, one of the company’s  largest  shareholders  and  its  former chief executive. And CCNY officials, according to the school’s own  records, had high hopes for AIG—a donation of perhaps as much as $10 million.’’  Some may have heard of AIG. It has  been a little bit in the news lately.  Now my point is that is an accusation made by the New York Times, not  by me, not by any Member of this  House. That is an accusation made by  the New York Times that should be resolved because it is about our number  one tax man, and our number one tax  man along with the President of the  United States  is going to be championing the Democrat budget of $3.6  trillion, a number that almost defies  imagination.  We have gotten used to trillions in  the last 60 days because we have seen  lots of  them. They are everywhere.  This administration is throwing trillions  around  like  tennis  balls  at  Wimbledon and we are  sitting here  looking at a new little slight glitch of  $3.6 trillion. I would think that the average American looking at this budget  would  like to know that the people  that designed it and the people that  put  it together shoot straight, deal  ethically with issues. And they would  like to know that, but they have an accusation  from the New York Times  that says contrary to that.  So is there a place to resolve that?  Yes, we have one. It is called the Ethics Committee. But there is no action  out of the Ethics Committee. It just  kind of sits there.  So I guess our famous Rangel rule  which now  is on everybody’s tongue  about special privileges for Mr. RANGEL, I guess we add this to the Rangel  rule. I don’t know what else to do with  it.

So it’s really important.  We are not going to get to where we  want to go though in this process of  doing health care reform and trying to  find ways to save money, which we all  want to do, if we don’t recognize the  cost of medical education.  ",2009
94,House,111,0.559,78,2009-03-17,Mr. SCALISE.," Reclaiming my time,  the gentleman from Texas makes some  wonderful  points. And  I  appreciate  your concern for what happens when  Madison, my daughter, grows up and  what kind of country she is going to be  left with and what kind of debt she is  going to inherit. And I think when the  American people across the country  look at this—and they’ve started to  look at it in, I think, a very close way.  And what they’re telling me when I go  back home, and those of us that have  gone throughout the country to our  districts, they’re telling us that this  budget spends too much and it taxes  too much. And it borrows too much  from future generations at the expense  of our ability to get our economy back  on  track  to help  those  small businesses.  And then they look and they say,  well, what are all of these deficits?  What is all of this spending going toward? And what they see, they see that  first stimulus bill, they look at this  TARP money, they look at what’s happening with that TARP money and AIG  and companies that are getting this  money. In some cases, you can’t even  find out what they did with the money.  And then when you find out what they  did, it makes you even more angry because you see they are giving it in bonuses to people who helped run those  companies into the ground. These are  people who truly would be unemployed  because  they bankrupted  their own  companies, and today the only reason  they have a job is because of these Federal bailouts of these companies. And  then they are using that money—not to  make loans, but something even more  egregious. And as angered as we are  hearing  about  these  bonuses  that  they’re paying—$160 million in bonuses  that AIG paid to  its executives—we  also found out today that AIG used $26  billion of that taxpayer money to give  to French  and German  banks—not  American banks, to help our American  banking system, but $26 billion of that  TARP money went  to German and  French banks, which might be helping  their economies in those countries, but  it sure isn’t helping America. So for  those of us who voted against those  bailouts, saying I told you so doesn’t  help anybody, but saying this madness  has to end.  And people are looking at this. And  then they are seeing the budget that’s  proposed. And  they’re  seeing  these  huge spikes in deficit spending and this  huge amount of new government socializing of different systems and forms  of our economy, and it’s scaring people.  Because when you look at the stock  market, the stock market is an indication not just of what’s happening to  those individual companies, but of consumer confidence. In fact, since this  President took office in January, the  stock market is down about 25 percent.  That means 401(k)s out there, families  who are investing in those markets,  their retirement savings are down over  25 percent just since January 20. We’re  not talking about something that has  been going on  for over a year now,  we’re talking about something that is  maybe 2 months in the making, a 25  percent decrease because people are  seeing  these  plans—these  spending  plans, these tax plans, this massive  borrowing—and  they  are  realizing  somebody has to pay for this.  And what are we doing with this  money? And you can’t even go find it.  It’s not helping our country get back  on track; because, again, if you go back  to the Great Depression—and we said  we are going to talk about this a little  bit—during the Great Depression in the  1930s,  it wasn’t because  they didn’t  spent enough money. They actually  spent money for years and years and  the depression stayed as bad as it was.  For over 8 years they spent money.  And there is an old saying, if you don’t  learn from history, you are doomed to  repeat it.  Back in the 1930s, the budget director,  the Treasury  Secretary  under  FDR, Henry Morgenthau, actually said,  ‘‘We’re  spending  too much money.’’  After 8 years of them spending money,  they were still at double-digit unemployment. We were still in a Great Depression. In fact, some people said we  were  in a  recession  then, and  the  spending brought us into a Great Depression. And FDR’s own Treasury Secretary in the 1930s said it’s the spending that’s giving us all this massive  debt, and it’s not doing anything to  help  our  economy.  It wasn’t until  World War  II that we got back on  track.  And so people are looking at that and  saying, wait a minute; we sure don’t  want to make the mistakes of history’s  past if we learn how we are going to  get  ourselves  out  of  this  problem  today.

99,Senate,111,0.782,120,2009-03-17,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, that is a  straightforward amendment. The authors of this bill said we are never  going to use eminent domain for any of  this, even though they reference two or  three statutes that give eminent domain. Well, if that is the case, if we are  never going to use eminent domain to  accomplish the purposes of this, there  should be no trouble accepting this  amendment. This amendment just says  we can’t. On this bill, you can’t use  eminent domain to take the property  away from somebody who doesn’t wish  to give their property.  Amendment 5 of the U.S. Constitution says:  No person shall be deprived of life, liberty,  or property without due process of law, nor  shall private property be taken without just  compensation.  That is the Constitution. But the father of the Constitution said it a different way. He said, in a word:  As a man is said to have a right to his  property, he may be equally said to have a  property in his right.  Eminent domain is necessary and appropriate at times in this country for  national defense,  for the health and  well-being of the country, for priorities  that protect the public at large, and  that makes  sense. There are  times  when we have to use it. There is not a  time associated with any of the parts  of this bill that we should have to use  eminent domain.  I have been assured by the authors of  this bill that they have no intention of  using eminent domain. If that is the  case,  then  support  this amendment,  and we will never have a problem with  it. The property rights folks in this  country, of which about 100 support  this amendment, would  say  that  is  great, so let’s vote it up or down.  But if we vote against it, what is it  going to tell them? What it is going to  do  is erode the confidence of  landowners in this country. We say we are  not going to take your land away from  you without your permission, without  there being a willing seller, but we  have kind of a king’s edge. We have our  fingers crossed behind our backs because there may be some time when a  bureaucrat has made a decision other  than what we are saying tonight.  So the way to enforce that would be  a straightforward message that says,  according to this amendment,  ‘‘notwithstanding any other provisions of  this act, or any amendment that  is  made to this act, no land or interest in  land, other than an access easement,  shall be required under this act by eminent domain.’’  That  is straightforward. Let’s give  them confidence that we are not going  to take their land away against their  will.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and  suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

Pebblebrook High School Performing Arts  Chamber Choir was selected out of dozens of  high school choirs across the country for this  performance. The concert will feature 200 students from four states, and is the capstone of  Carnegie Hall’s yearlong National High School  Choral Festival. The concert will be conducted  by Dr. Craig Jessop, esteemed Director of the  Utah State University Music Department and  former director of  the Mormon Tabernacle  Choir, who has been working with the choirs  and  their  conductors  throughout  the  year.  Apart  from  their world-renowned  performances, Carnegie Hall brings innovative music  education programs to students across the nation. I am delighted that these young constituents have been given this opportunity.  Led by George Case, the Pebblebrook High  School Performing Arts Chamber Choir performs works from all periods of classical music  with a strong emphasis on 20th- and 21st-century compositions with a  focus on choral/orchestral masterworks. The Choir has shared  the stage with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Cobb Symphony Orchestra, and has  entered numerous competitions and adjudications at which they have consistently received  superior ratings and awards. Choir members  are actively involved in extracurricular performances and are given the opportunity to work  with top professionals in the arts from the Atlanta area and throughout the United States.  I am honored  to have one of  the  four  schools in the nation chosen for the Carnegie  Hall National High School Choral Festival residing in my Georgia district. They should be  proud not only of their musical achievement,  but  their embodiment of  the quality musical  education  the State of Georgia provides.  I  commend these students and their leaders for  their success, and wish them the best of luck  on March 20 when they perform at Carnegie  Hall.

This enchanted day promises old  friendships  renewed,  the discovery of new  ones, and  the spirit of all  those  joining  together to celebrate Irish culture.  Justice Sean Ryan studied in Dublin at University College and at Dublin & King University  where he studied law. After being called to the  Bar in 1972, Justice Ryan practiced as junior  counsel in the South Eastern Circuit of Ireland  until 1983, when he was appointed to Senior  Counsel. For  the next  twenty years, Justice  Ryan worked diligently in Ireland’s High Court  and Supreme Court on a wide range of cases  and issues, including constitutional law, law of  torts,  criminal  law  and  administrative  law.  Since 2001, Justice Ryan has focused his energy and expertise on investigating cases of  child abuse and working as an advocate for  victims of child abuse.

She  began her academic career as a Dance Education major and progressed to a Pre-Physical  Therapy major and fell in love with an Athletic  Training major. After completing  two semesters in the Pre-Physical Therapy program at  Kingsborough Community College, she decided it was time to move on to a more exciting and productive field—the field of Athletic  Training and Sports Sciences. The  field of  Athletic Trainers was made for her because it  is designed for Health Care Professionals who  specialize  in prevention, assessment,  treatment and  rehabilitation of  injuries and  illnesses that occur to athletes and the physically active. All Certified Athletic Trainers  must have at least a bachelor’s degree in athletic training, which is an allied health profession, must pass a comprehensive exam before  earning the ATC credential, must keep knowledge and skills current by participating in continuing education and must adhere to standards of professional practice set by a national  certifying agency.  The combination of dance education & athletic performance was a winning combination  for her personality because she loves helping  people, teaching, watching and participating in  sports.  In addition  to nurturing her students  through academic  requirements  for  the program, she has had the honor and privilege of  working with over 1000 athletes worldwide;  high school, junior college, division one collegiate athletes, semi professional and professional.

105,,111,-0.428,1,2009-03-30,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Madam Speaker,  as we approach health care reform,  there is no area that is more vital for  honest discussion and careful analysis  than what happens at end of a patient’s  life. For most of us, we will get the majority of our lifetime health care in  that last year. Indeed, for many it is  just the last few months of life, we use  the most doctor care, the most intervention  in  terms of medical procedures, the most days in a hospital. This  is clearly the time of greatest stress  both for the patient and the family as  they watch their loved one enter what  is often a struggle in these last few  months.  The evidence is that this is the hardest period to be able to make those  critical decisions. We don’t want to  force  spur-of-the-moment  action  for  families when they are talking about  things that have great consequence for  the quality of life for not just a ‘‘patient’’ but a family member, the ability to extend the quality of life, and  perhaps deal with recovery. This is also  the worst time  for people to go on  autopilot check out, to have a default  option where they just turn decisions  over to whatever the local medical activity may be on that site without a  thought and consequence to what the  individual wishes of the patient and  their family may be.  There  is  strong  evidence  that  in  many cases the very intensive activities—the tubes, the procedures, the operations,  the  ventilators—actually  don’t prolong life, and they certainly  impact in a negative sense the quality  of life, the way that the patient may be  able to interact with their family and  friends in those last few days and their  mind-set and their pain level.  This  research has  sparked  action  from coast to coast. Many States have  developed a new end-of-life care directive called Orders For Life Sustaining  Treatment. They are being developed  in over 30 States. They help the seriously ill patient identify their treatment preferences using clear, standardized language. It is written as actionable medical orders signed by a physician, and they help communicate patient preferences regarding the intensity of medical intervention, transfers  to hospitals, use of antibiotics, artificially administered nutrition and resuscitation.  Members of my family and I have  concluded that we don’t want those extraordinary measures as our default,  and have signed  instructions accordingly.  What we find, however, is that too  many people don’t have access to the  counseling and activities for them to  be able to make an informed decision.  The irony is that the Medicare system  will spend thousands and thousands of  dollars on  intense medical  intervention,  intense medical activities, but  they won’t spend a few dollars to pay a  doctor to have a conversation with a  patient and the family about what they  can expect, what their choices are, and  to be able to engage with the patient  and the  family to decide what they  want to have happen.  I guess that we don’t do it to save  money; but the evidence suggests that  when people actually have a choice,  they choose things that not only improve their quality of life, but actually  save money. Why don’t we give individual patients and their families that  choice under Medicare?  That’s why I will be introducing the  Life Sustaining Treatment Preferences  Act which will provide coverage under  Medicare  for consultations regarding  end-of-life  treatment  options.  It  is  time for Medicare to be able to address  the needs that will truly reflect the  preferences, the wishes, and the quality-of-life choices for Medicare patients  and their families. It is the humane,  compassionate thing to do. It will help  us allocate our health care resources  more appropriately to treat what people want, and it will relieve the pressure on the health care system so the  default isn’t always the most intensive,  expensive interventions that often deteriorate the quality of life in those  final days.  I would urge my colleagues to look at  this option and join me in making sure  that we modernize Medicare to meet  the needs of patients and their families  in their final hours.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

No one feels this pressure or deserves the  support of a grateful Nation more than our disabled Veterans.  Our Nation’s veterans have made costly  sacrifices  to ensure  the safety of America’s  families. For that reason, our country provides  both compensation payments  to service-disabled Veterans and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits to the survivors of  servicemembers who die in service to our Nation.  However, without this bill, these payments  would not keep up with rising prices for everyday items like gas and groceries.  That’s why, on behalf of the over 3 million  veterans nationally—including 65,000  in my  home state of Arizona—who are currently receiving disability compensation,  I am asking  you to join me in support of this bill.  This bill keeps the promise to our Nation’s  veterans  to honor  the sacrifice  that  these  brave men and women have endured while  serving our country in uniform.  ",2009
108,House,111,-0.353,8,2009-03-30,Mr. LYNCH.," Madam Speaker, I move  to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 223) Honoring the  life, achievements, and contributions  of Paul Harvey, affectionately known  for his signature line,  ‘‘This is Paul  Harvey . . . Good Day,’’ as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 223  Whereas Paul Harvey, a son, brother, husband,  father,  friend, pioneering American,  and a cherished voice, passed away on February 28, 2009;  Whereas Paul Harvey Aurandt was born on  September 4, 1918, in Tulsa, Oklahoma;  Whereas prefacing a storied career in radio  by making radio receivers as a young boy  and a fill-in announcer while a student at  the University of Tulsa, he epitomized American values and American ideals proving that  one can lead a decent life with hard work  and solid values;  Whereas Paul Harvey, through open expression,  pioneered  the  format  of  radio  broadcasts that so many now find commonplace;  Whereas Paul Harvey was a blogger before  it was a known medium, he  just did his  blogging on the radio;  Whereas Paul Harvey was elected to the  National Association of Broadcasters Radio  Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Hall of Fame  and appeared on the Gallup poll list of America’s most admired men;  Whereas in 2005, Paul Harvey was awarded  the Presidential Medal  of Freedom,  the  United States’ most  prestigious  civilian  award, by President George W.

110,House,111,-0.389,15,2009-03-30,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman of our subcommittee, Mr.  PALLONE, for giving me time to speak.  LOIS  Of course, I’m speaking in strong support of H.R. 1246, the Early Hearing Detection and  Intervention Act.  I am  very proud to have introduced this bill  with my colleague, Congresswoman Jo  Ann Emerson of Missouri.  I want to commend the leadership of  the Hearing Health Caucus, Congressman VERNEHLERSand Congresswoman  CAROLYNMCCARTHY, our leaders of this  caucus now, and I must also mention  the work of former Congressman Jim  Walsh of New York who had championed this issue for many years before  his retirement.  As our chairman mentioned, each  year more than 12,000 infants are born  with hearing loss. If left undetected,  this condition impairs speech development, language development, and cognitive development. Back in 2000, we  developed the early hearing detection  program, thanks to the hard work of  the Hearing Health Caucus, and since  that time, we’ve seen a tremendous increase in the number of newborns who  are now being  screened  for hearing  loss.  Back  in  2000, only  44 percent of  newborns were being screened for hearing loss. That’s less than half of the babies  born.  Now,  we’re  screening  newborns at a rate of over 93 percent.  So this legislation has had an impact.  Again, I commend the work of those  made  it happen and all of the hard  work of our colleagues here in Congress  and the Senate and the signing into  law.  But we know now that our work is  not done. According to the Centers for  Disease Control, almost half of  the  newborns who fail initial screening of  their hearing do not go on to receive  appropriate follow-up care, and we need  to train more health professionals with  the skills necessary to provide effective intervention.  As a school nurse for over 20 years, I  had a lot of interaction with students  who were lagging behind their classmates,  failing  in  class  due  to  undiagnosed or untreated hearing loss.  We can prevent more children from suffering in the classroom and really suffering throughout their lives through  better investment in follow-up intervention as a part of the successful  hearing  screening  program  for  newborns and infants.  I urge our colleagues to join in voting in favor of H.R. 1246.  ",2009
111,House,111,0.26,22,2009-03-30,Mr. KING of New York.," Mr. Speaker, today  I rise in strong support of H.R. 479, the Wakefield Act, which will reauthorize the Emergency  Medical Services for Children program for an  additional four years.  Since its establishment in 1985, the Emergency Medical Services for Children program,  also known as EMSC, has provided grants to  all  fifty states,  the District of Columbia, and  five U.S. territories to ensure that every child  in America has access to quality, appropriate  care in a health emergency. The EMSC program has improved the availability of child-appropriate equipment in ambulances and emergency departments, supported hundreds of  programs  to prevent  injuries, and provided  thousands of hours of training to EMTs, paramedics, and other emergency medical care  providers.  In my home state, New York’s EMSC program  is working  to provide ongoing assessment and  improvement of medical care  for  critically ill or injured children. The state EMSC  Advisory Committee continually meets to discuss plans  for designating health care  resources to optimally serve the needs of critically ill or injured pediatric patients. This Committee is currently designing a road map of resources, standards, and  roles  for hospitals  within  the state and  for  the statewide EMS  system as a whole. The plan will improve the  state’s ability to bring children to the hospitals  that are best equipped to treat them as well as  establish a general set of  interfacility guidelines.  Kids are not just small adults. Methods to  treat children in emergencies vary greatly from  methods used with adults in the same situations. The EMSC program is an integral part  of preparing our nation’s healthcare providers  and giving them the tools they need to treat  children  in an emergency. This  is especially  significant at a time in our history that disaster  preparedness, both due to natural disasters as  well as potential terrorist attacks, is so important.  I would like to thank Representative MATHESON for his leadership on this issue, as well as  Representatives CASTOR for  their continued support. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support this imperative bill.  ",2009

114,House,111,-0.366,29,2009-03-30,Mr. PASCRELL.," I was pleased to introduce  the Vision Care  for Kids Act with my colleagues Congressmen GREEN, SULLIVAN, and  ENGELand Congresswoman ROS-LEHTINEN in  both this Congress and in the previous Congress. This important legislation will establish  a federal grant program to provide for timely  diagnostic examination, treatment, and follow-  up vision care  for children, which will complement existing State programs and allow  eye exams  for a vulnerable pediatric population  that do not qualify  for Medicaid or  SCHIP and do not have access  to private  health insurance.  This issue has long been near to my heart.  In fact, in 2003, I first championed legislation  to create a grant program  to provide comprehensive eye exams and necessary follow-  up care  for children whose  families do not  have the resources for or access to such care.  Preventive vision care is critically important to  avoid vision loss, and even blindness, in our  nation’s children, which can affect a child’s  physical, emotional, and  intellectual development.  The CDC states that approximately 1.8 million children under the age of 18 are blind or  have some form of visual impairment. Fortunately,  in most cases, vision  loss can be  avoided with early diagnosis and  treatment.  Eye health has a direct impact on learning and  achievement, and unfortunately, many visual  deficits are caught only after  they have  impaired a child’s early and most critical education. Consequently, it is a national disgrace  that only one in three children receive preventive vision care before they are enrolled in elementary school.  This essential  legislation will provide  the  tools to significantly mitigate the effects of visual impairment. In fact, H.R. 577 has the potential to open up a new world of academic  and social opportunity for approximately half a  million of our youngest children nationwide. As  Congress continues  its work  to  improve  the  health  care  and  educational  opportunities  available to children in this country, the need  to  remove outside  impediments  to  learning  must be addressed to achieve long-term success.  I would like to thank Chairman WAXMANand  Chairman PALLONE, for their thoughtful consideration and support for preventive vision care  for children, and I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of the Vision Care for Kids Act. Finally, I encourage the Senate to expeditiously  consider  this essential  legislation  to provide  necessary vision care to our nation’s most vulnerable children.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 577 ‘‘Vision Care for  Kids Act of 2009.’’  I want  to  thank my colleague Congressman GENEGREEN of Texas  for introducing this legislation.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  tell my colleagues that our nation’s children are our future. They should be the center of all of our  legislative efforts  to  improve  the  lives of all  Americans.  The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2009 is a  necessary grant program aimed at bolstering  children’s vision  initiatives  in  the states and  encouraging new community-based children’s  vision partnerships. This  legislation amends  the Public Health Service Act to authorize the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award  matching grants to states to complement existing state efforts to: (1) provide comprehensive  eye examinations from a licensed optometrist  or ophthalmologist for children who have been  previously identified through a vision screening  or eye examination by a licensed health care  provider or vision screener as needing such  services, who do not otherwise have coverage  for vision services, and who are low-income  children, with priority given to children who are  under the age of nine years; (2) provide treatment or services as necessary to correct identified vision problems; and  (3) develop and  disseminate to parents, teachers, and health  care practitioners educational materials on  recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.  We used to hold our child’s hands when our  child takes their first step. However, not many  help our children  to  learn how  to use  their  eyes properly, how to see properly, and how  to relax their eyes and protect their vision. Today’s education system requires our children  to give close attention, read many books, add  or subtract numbers or operate a computer for  hours. Therefore,  it  is  important  to  learn  to  guide our children to attain good child vision  health at various stages of their development.  Ten million children suffer from vision disorders,  according  to  the National Parent  Teacher Association. Vision disorders are considered the fourth most common disability in  the United States, and  they are one of  the  most  prevalent  handicapping  conditions  in  childhood. According to data from the Making  the Grade: An analysis of state and  federal  children’s vision care policy research study, 32  states require vision screenings for students,  but 29 of them do not require children who fail  the screening to have a comprehensive eye  examination. Because up to two-thirds of children who fail vision screenings do not comply  with recommended eye exams, many children  enter school with uncorrected vision problems.  Undetected and untreated vision deficiencies,  particularly in children, can take a large toll.  Studies have shown that the costs associated  with adult vision problems in the U.S. are at  $51.4 billion.  Undiagnosed and untreated vision problems  for children are serious  issues. Vision problems can affect a child’s cognitive, emotional,  neurological and physical development. While  vision disorders are  considered  the  fourth  most common disability in the United States,  two-thirds of all children entering school have  never received a vision test. For the one-third  of children who do receive a vision test, approximately 40–67 percent who fail the test do  not receive the recommended follow-up care.  I urge my colleagues to support the Vision  Care for Kids Act of 2009 so that we can protect our children of America.  ",2009

119,,111,0.284,141,2009-03-30,Mr. WOLF.," Madam Speaker,  the  right  to  worship according to the dictates of your conscience is among the most precious freedoms.  Tragically this basic freedom has not been  realized for millions around the globe. On January 16, the State Department designated the  annual ‘‘Countries of Particular Concern.’’ This  notorious  distinction  is  given  to  countries  deemed particularly severe violators of  religious  freedom. This year  the  list  included  Burma, China, Eritrea,  Iran, North Korea,  Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Uzbekistan.  Oftentimes the most powerful testimony of  the repressive nature of these governments is  found in the accounts of their own people.  Take the words of a 23-year-old Burmese  monk: ‘‘We did not expect that the junta would  crush down a peaceful demonstration but  when they raided the monasteries, shot and  arrested the monks. I was so surprised and  unbelievable that I could not express how my  feelings were. All my beliefs were also destroyed.’’  Or  the  reflections  of  a Chinese  house  church  leader:  ‘‘First, when  they arrest you,  they try to convince you to give up your faith.  And when you surrender  to  them  they will  offer you an office in a position such as community member or a position in the Three Self  church. If you do not deny your faith and surrender to them, then they will attack you. First  they put you into a small place, isolate you,  and they let you starve to convince you.’’  Or these insights from North Korea: ‘‘North  Korea  is a prison without bars. The reason  why the North Korean system still exists is because of the strict surveillance system. When  we provide the information like ‘this family believes  in a  religion  from  their grandfather’s  generation,’ the National Security Agency will  arrest each family member. That is why entire  families are scared of one another. Everyone  is supposed to be watching one another like  this . . .’’.  With the 1998 passage of the International  Religious Freedom Act, legislation which I authored, the promotion of religious freedom became official U.S.  foreign policy. Sadly, 10  years  later,  the  fight  for  this  ‘‘first  freedom’’  has never been more necessary. We must  commit ourselves anew to standing with persecuted people of faith around the world who  against all odds, in the face of fear, intimidation, imprisonment, torture and worse gather  secretly  to worship as  their conscience demands.  f  CONGRATULATING DR.

",2009
123,House,111,-0.426,40,2009-04-21,Mr. TONKO.," I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon, and he obviously  has an outstanding voice speaking to  what is the smart approach to the future of this country and certainly to  the impact that we can make on American households and on American businesses.  The country faces, undeniably, economic energy and certainly climate  crises, and this is a time for a plan of  action.  I believe that as we have just heard,  there are these opportunities that are  shelf ready, available to American consumers, to American businesses today.  There are emerging technologies as we  speak. This requires an immense investment.  And if there is a strategy that has  been promoted here by the President  that has been advanced by the Speaker  of this House, NANCYPELOSI, and endorsed by the leadership, it’s to move  forward in a way that is intellectually  honest, looking at the factors out there  that exist. The human elements that  are causing an impact through global  warming, through climate change that  are growing the carbon footprint.  The President knows that the down  payment of the Recovery Act was just  the beginning of the story. He knows  that in order to resolve the many crises facing this country, including, primarily, an economic crisis, we need to  be smart about our plan of action. He  knows that it will require an investment, an investment through R&D, of  research and development that will enable us to produce savings.  And we hear an awful  lot of talk  about a tax being  imposed. The tax  that is imposed is coming through billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of  dollars paid by American companies,  by American  consumers,  by households, that is going to places like the  Middle East and Venezuela, paying for  fossil-based fuels that are polluting our  environment, that are driving downward, through these crises, the American economy.  We have an option out there, and  that option is to be smart, to go forward with American-produced power,  done through American jobs, to save  and grow American jobs. That is a good  and clever strategy. We can do this by  embracing the intellectual capacity of  this great Nation, shelf-ready opportunities of which I am quite familiar.  Certainly, when I was over at the Energy Research and Development Authority in New York State, I witnessed  firsthand how policies and programs  were  implemented by that authority  that is nationally inspected, and it was  through the retrofits that we had done  with the farming community, with the  business community, with households,  through building efforts, that we were  able to achieve immense savings.  These savings are dollars and benefits to the consuming public. They are  job creating  in  terms of dynamics.  When we look at the renewable standards, the renewable energy standards  that are part of the package to respond  to the energy crises of this country, we  are talking about the creation of some  300,000 jobs.  When we  look at the energy efficiency resource standards, we are looking at some 220,000 jobs. When we look  at the economic savings of the energy  jobs creation, the green-collar job creation, we are talking about a savings of  some of $100 billion. In the area of energy efficiency, a savings of $170 billion. So these are real dollars. They are  savings.  What I think our  friends who are  speaking so vociferously against this  proposal do not comprehend, that savings and cleanup of our environment  are benefits that are immeasurable at  this point in time, and this economy  requires that sort of investment, that  sort of policy creation.

128,Senate,111,-0.382,110,2009-04-21,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  rise because yesterday marks 10 years  since the shootings at Columbine High  School in Littleton, CO, and on this  10th anniversary, we need  to  speak  about the problems with our Nation’s  gun laws.  Whether  it  is Columbine, Virginia  Tech, Mexican gun trafficking or the  recent killings  in Pittsburgh, Binghamton, and Oakland we are reminded  over and over again that our gun laws  are not strong enough, and it is time  we said—not another day.  Not another day should we allow the  gun show loophole to stand.  Not another day should we allow gun  dealers to sell firearms without conducting a background check.  Not another day should we allow terrorists, criminals, gun traffickers and  the mentally ill to buy firearms.  It is as easy as ever for criminals to  buy guns—easier, in fact, than it is to  get a library card.  What happened at Columbine High  School 10 years ago was a tragedy none  of us can forget.  Two shooters went on a rampage and  killed 12 students and 1 teacher.  But here is what a lot of people do  not realize: all of the firearms used by  the shooters were bought at gun shows.  That means, because of the gun show  loophole, they were bought without a  background  check,  and  they were  bought ‘‘cash and carry,’’ no questions  asked.  Those 13 people never should have  died  because  those  teenagers never  should have had those guns.  Just think: the young woman who  bought the guns for the shooters said  she wouldn’t have done it had a background check been required.  In 1999, I introduced legislation to  close the gun show loophole and keep  guns from falling into the wrong hands.  In the aftermath of Columbine, the  Senate  passed my  legislation, with  Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-  breaking vote.  It was a great victory, but it was  short lived. The gun lobby stripped my  legislation in conference.  Ten years later, this gap in our law  still remains.  We were reminded of that last Thursday when we marked the second anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings.  In that tragedy, a mentally deranged  man killed 32 students and faculty in  the worst mass shooting in American  history.  The Virginia Tech shooter was able  to obtain his guns from licensed gun  dealers because the records of his mental illness were not in the background  check database as they were supposed  to  be. But  if  a  background  check  stopped him from buying his guns from  a gun dealer, he could have walked to  a gun show and purchased the guns  with no background check.  Yesterday we marked the 14th anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing—the Nation’s worst domestic terrorist attack.  The men responsible  for that despicable act frequently bought and sold  firearms at gun shows.  Gun trafficking to Mexico is another  reminder of the dangers of the gun  show loophole.  We know that as many as 30 percent  of the  firearms traveling across our  border into Mexico originate from gun  shows.  We have  an  opportunity  to  save  lives—and that is why I am reintroducing legislation today to close the  gun show loophole once and for all.  Closing the gun show loophole will  not adversely affect licensed gun sellers and it will not place a burden on  law-abiding gun owners.  It simply ends a dangerous, unnecessary exemption so that the Brady Law  is applied equally.  But  that difference—the difference  between buying a gun with a background check and not—is everything.  It is the difference between saving  lives and putting more at risk, between  keeping guns out of the wrong hands  and letting terrorists and others have  easy access to guns, and the difference  between upholding the rule of law or  allowing loopholes to undermine it.  Specifically, my  legislation would  take several steps to make gun show  transactions safer for all Americans:  gun shows are defined to include any  event at which 50 or more firearms are  offered or exhibited for sale. This definition includes not only those events  where  firearms are  the main  commodity  sold, but also other  events  where a significant number of guns are  sold, such as  flea markets or swap  meets.  Gun show promoters would be required to register with the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF,  maintain a list of vendors at all gun  shows, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge  receipt  of  information  about their legal obligations.  The bill requires that all  firearms  sales at gun shows go through a Federal Firearms Licensee, FFL. If a nonlicensed person  is selling a weapon,  they would use an FFL at the gun show  to complete the transaction. The FFL  would be responsible for conducting a  Brady  check on  the purchaser and  maintaining records of the transaction.

Alicia has earned the promotion to this distinguished post with more  than 22 years of  dedicated service  to her community and a  faithful commitment  to  the mission of Pilot  International.  Admired by peers in the Pilot Club of Valley  Forge for her willingness to provide countless  hours of volunteer service, Alicia has taught  4H students the craft of sewing, started and  supervised an after-school program  for  local  elementary school students and served several years on the board of a local Boy Scout  Troop.  She also has selflessly served her church  by teaching Sunday school, preparing children  for sacraments, caring for the linens and as a  member of the Finance Committee.  Alicia will become Governor of  the Northeast Potomac District during a ceremony on  May 3, 2009.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me today in congratulating Alicia Fox on  this tremendous achievement and recognizing  her outstanding volunteer spirit and drive  to  improve the quality of life in her community.  f  FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION  AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. DAVID WU  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 1, 2009  ",2009
130,,111,-0.37,117,2009-04-21,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention  and Tobacco Control Act.  Statistics are handed out on this floor like  candy. Because numbers are often passed off  as nothing more than empty words, we fail to  recognize how staggering  they are. For  instance, smoking-related diseases cause an  estimated  440,000 American  deaths  each  year. Smoking costs  the United States over  $150 billion annually in health care costs. And  a 2004 study by the CDC’s National Center for  Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion  found  that cigarette smoke contains  over 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known  to cause cancer.  Ninety percent of adult smokers are addicted to tobacco before they reach the age of  18; 50 percent before the age of 14. Currently  the average age of initiation to tobacco is 11.  48 million adults smoke in the U.S., which is  22.9 percent of the population overall, and 33  percent of youth currently smoke.  To be quiet honest Madam Speaker, these  statistics are more than staggering—they are  atrocious.  It was Irving Selikoff, a medical researcher  who co-discovered a cure for tuberculosis who  said, ‘‘Statistics are real people with the tears  wiped away.’’  Those real people are our parents and children, our  family and  friends, who suffer  the  consequences of addiction to tobacco. I want  my children to grow up healthy and to make  healthy decisions. To help that happen, H.R.  256 will put in place the proper authority for  the Food and Drug Administration to establish  regulations over  tobacco products. We need  the FDA  to protect our population  from  the  harmful effects of cigarettes and tobacco products by being able to provide sound, scientific  regulations governing these products.  Even with all the warnings, and the money  spent on education campaigns, kids are still  picking up smoking at  the alarming  rate of  3,000 a day in the United States.  The health concerns  that will  face  these  children are costly, painful, and deadly. But  they are also ultimately preventable.  I ask my colleagues  to please pass H.R.  1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.  f  TRIBUTE TO CAROL LAFLEUR  HON.

132,,111,0.593,138,2009-04-21,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker, over  the past several years, Southeast Texas has  been the target during Hurricane Season. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit in 2006  and  the very  recent Hurricane  Ike  in September 2008. Not to mention Hurricane Gustav, which did not cause a disaster in Texas,  many believe it was just a trial run before Hurricane  Ike. Hurricane  Ike came along  two  weeks later on September 13, 2008.  These hurricanes have  taught emergency  management officials to be prepared in time of  a disaster. Through  their preparedness  they  are able to assist and help other individuals  evacuate  the city  in a  timely manner. The  most recent development is the Portable Inflatable Hospital presented by  the East Texas  Gulf Coast Regional Trauma Advisory. With  the help of the emergency management officials, numerous area hospitals and others, this  incredible development was established. State  and federal Grants help fund the hospital that  cost around 1.5 million. This portable hospital  is a great way for medical personnel to assist  patients during a disaster and for the patients  to get the quick response medical help they  need. The medical assistance can range from  distributing medications to on site emergency  care. The facility can operate as one or three  separate facilities. It is equipped with beds, living areas, and other units. This project has  had a great response from individuals willing  to donate, but still needs any help it can get  from our local Southeast Texans. The medical  personnel and emergency officials are very  grateful for this newly facility. It will be located  in Southeast Texas, but can be set up across  the state. The hospital will cost five thousand  dollars  to operate daily plus an additional  twelve thousand dollars to generate the portable hospital.  Emergency preparedness is very crucial in  time of a disaster. With our great response  teams in Southeast Texas the portable hospital will be ready in time of need. I would like  to  thank  the  individuals who spend endless  hours preparing for Hurricane Season.  f  HONORING MR. JACOB  TANENBAUM  HON. ELIOT L.

133,,111,-0.408,138,2009-04-21,Mr. ENGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  honor Mr. Jacob Tanenbaum, an outstanding  constituent and educator from the 17th Congressional District of New York, for his exemplary efforts in bringing real scientific research  to the classroom.  Jacob Tanenbaum, an elementary school  teacher at the South Orangetown schools in  Rockland County, New York, was chosen by  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Teacher at Sea Program to  participate  in a  two-week research cruise  in  the North Atlantic this past fall to study Atlantic  fisheries while aboard NOAA Ship HENRYB.  BIGELOW.  Embarking from Newport, Rhode Island, Mr.  Tanenbaum’s research cruise followed a track  off the United States’ northeastern coast. Mr.  Tanenbaum not only researched fisheries, but  also wrote a daily blog,  took photographs,  interviewed scientists, and engaged  in dialogue with his students, fellow teachers, and  the general public. Mr. Tanenbaum became  an  integral part of  the  research  team and  ship’s crew and established relationships that  will give him and his colleagues access to scientific resources for many years to come. With  his at-sea experience, Mr. Tanenbaum has  been able to enrich his curriculum and excite  his students about science.  In one of his blogs, Mr. Tanenbaum wrote,  ‘‘Through NOAA’s Teacher at Sea Program,  students are not  just  learning about exciting  research projects at sea, they are witnesses to  them, and on some level, participants in them.  The Teacher at Sea program is about something far more important than test scores and  text books. It is about inspiration and excitement.  Inspiring  learning and creating excitement about learning are not just simple hoped-  for extras in an educational setting—they are  the most essential parts of a culture of learning.’’  I congratulate Mr. Tanenbaum on his spirit  of adventure  in  the name of education, his  willingness to try new things, and his ability to  bring this experience back into the classroom.  NOAA’s Teacher at Sea program has afforded  Mr. Tanenbaum an unparalleled opportunity to  provide his students with hands-on scientific  education, grounded in his unique experience.  The lessons he learned on the BIGELOWwill  stay with Mr. Tanenbaum for the rest of his  teaching  career, acting as a  source  from  which he will always be able to draw inspiration and creativity.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  CONFLICTED  INVESTMENT  ADVICE  PROHIBITION ACT OF 2009  HON.

That’s why I was pleased  that President Obama  recently  directed the U.S. Trade Representative  to  work  through  any  outstanding  issues so that we can move forward  with a Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The President  is  right: more  open trade is a win-win for both countries, and we need bipartisan action to  pass this trade agreement, but Congress’ lack of action has harmed U.S.  interests, and it has given a competitive advantage to other countries.  How can American businesses compete when the European Union, Canada, China, and Latin America countries have better access to the Colombian market?  Over 80 percent of U.S. exports of  consumer  and  industrial  products  would become duty free immediately,  but  instead, Congress’  inaction has  cost U.S. exporters more than $1.5 billion in tariffs to Colombia.  Madam Speaker,  let’s do what  is  right and quickly pass the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE  OF EVA A.

On March 27, 2009, Eva passed  away at the age of 87, surrounded by  loving family, friends and neighbors.  Eva was a devoted mother, wife, and  was an active member of the Rock Island community. She participated in  the American Legion Post 246 Auxiliary and the Moline Croatian Crest  Club. She also devoted many hours to  St. Mary’s Catholic Church and to the  Altar Society.  I had the pleasure of knowing Eva as  the mother of my friend, Wayne Valentine. I have many fond memories of  Eva as Wayne and I grew up together.  She was a reliable source of support,  and she helped me become the person  that I am today. I owe Eva my thanks  and my gratitude.  Eva will be dearly missed by her husband, John, by her son, Wayne, by numerous nieces, nephews, friends, and by  the Rock Island community. As we celebrate and remember her long life, we  are reminded of the important influence Eva was and will continue to be in  our lives.

As I’ve traveled across my district in  western Pennsylvania, I’ve seen firsthand how abusive credit card practices  can devastate families throughout this  country, especially during this recession. The time has come to end the unfair,  deceptive,  and  anticompetitive  practices by  credit  card  companies.  These include soaring fees, arbitrary  interest rate hikes, due-date gimmicks,  and the incomprehensible credit card  contracts that all Americans are familiar with.  The  Credit  Cardholders’  Bill  of  Rights offers an important opportunity  to protect consumers from these practices, and this legislation can’t come  soon  enough. With  consumer  credit  card debt approaching $1 trillion, we  cannot wait any longer to hold credit  card  companies accountable and  to  give American cardholders more control over their credit  limits. That’s  why I urge my colleagues to act today  and join me in passing the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights.  f  THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  FALL OF SAIGON  (Mr. CAO asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
137,House,111,0.133,2,2009-04-30,Mr. CAO.," Madam Speaker, on April  28, 1975, an 8-year-old boy was rushed  into an American C–130 to seek freedom in a foreign land. Two days later,  on April 30, the Communist forces rumbled into Saigon and marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in  the long and illustrious history of Vietnam.  Immediately following April 30, the  Communist government initiated one  of the most horrific cultural and political cleansings of our time. Hundreds of  thousands of religious, political, and  military leaders were thrown into re-  education  camps.  Approximately  300,000 people died at sea while fleeing  the horrors of this regime; and of those  who  remained,  thousands more died  from famine.  Madam Speaker,  today marks  the  34th anniversary of that dark day in  April when Saigon fell. The 8-year-old  boy of whom I spoke now stands before  you. I, on behalf of the 1.5 million Vietnamese  living  in the United States,  take this opportunity to remember all  who perished in the Vietnam conflict.  I urge my colleagues to work with  the Vietnamese communities around  the world to promote a free and democratic Vietnam.  f  MACKENZIE BROWN  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

143,House,111,-0.341,30,2009-04-30,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Minimum payment practices, which  often are deceptive at best and abusive  at worst, clearly contribute  to  the  problem of unmanageable debt. And  they need to be reined in. That’s exactly what the Price-Miller of North  Carolina-Moran  of  Virginia-Quigley-  Stupak-Sutton-Lowey amendment will  do. Our amendment would ensure that  consumers receive a warning of the  risks of making only the minimum  monthly payment and information on  the total cost of paying only monthly  minimum payments on their balance.  It would also require issuers to provide  quarterly  assessments  of  the  monthly payments that must be made  to pay off the current balance of the  consumer in 1, 2 or 3 years. And it  would establish consumer credit counseling and debt management services  through a toll-free telephone number.  Let me  assure  colleagues, we’ve  sought to ensure that these requirements are not too onerous for credit  card companies. For example, disclosure  requirements  target  only  consumers who regularly have not paid  their balances in full. Our amendment  will help consumers regain control of  cascading credit card debt.  So I urge colleagues to support this  amendment to provide American families with the tools they need to help  them manage their money effectively.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

145,House,111,-0.376,30,2009-04-30,Mr. MILLER of North Carolina.," Mr.  Chairman, about 35 million Americans  just pay their monthly payment, the  minimum monthly payment on their  credit card every year. And some of the  opponents of this bill may have very  little sympathy for families that are  deep in debt. But as our economy has  produced billionaires who have done  nothing of any conspicuous value to society, there are millions of American  families that are working very hard  and struggling to get by, and it is very  tempting when  they’re doing  triage  with their bills and they know they  can’t pay everything, for their eye to  skip down to the minimum monthly  payment and just pay that. This bill  makes sure they know what the consequences of that are. This amendment  makes sure. It informs them of what  kind of debt they’re going to be in, how  much it’s going to cost them in interest, how long they’re going to be in  debt, how deep the hole will be, and  what it is going to take to get out.  I applaud Mr. PRICE for his efforts.  And I urge all Members to vote for this  amendment.  ",2009
146,House,111,-0.317,30,2009-04-30,Mr. QUIGLEY.," I rise in strong support of this amendment because today  QUIGLEY,  the average American can apply for a  credit card anywhere, at a grocery  store, at an airport, a ballpark, even  college campuses. It all seems so easy.  Unfortunately,  the  terms  of  the  agreements aren’t so easy.  In some  cases,  terms have  become  so  complicated  that  the average consumer  cannot always know what they’ve gotten themselves into.  Now more than ever, Americans are  turning to their credit cards to get  them through the end of the month,  and in turn, the U.S. credit card debt  has reached an all-time high.  Meanwhile, almost half of Americans  carry a balance and have no idea how  long it’ll take to pay that down. The  Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights will  protect  consumers  from  predatory  practices, and this specific amendment  will give them the ability to pay down  their debts.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’  on this amendment and the underlying  bill.  ",2009
147,House,111,-0.388,30,2009-04-30,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.  The amendment would  require additional  disclosure  information on credit card statements. While most cardholders know it takes  a great deal of time to pay off a balance by  making only the minimum payment, most do  not understand the total additional costs they  will pay. This amendment would change that.  Based on industry norms of an 18 percent  APR and 4 percent minimum payment requirement, a cardholder will spend 87 months and  $1,515 paying off a balance of $1,000 if making only the minimum payments. The finance  charges are more than 50 percent of the actual balance.  Our amendment would  require  that each  statement have a warning on minimum payments and that every quarter, cardholders receive a statement  that  lists  the number of  months it would take to pay the entire balance  if only  the minimum payments are made,  along with the total cost of doing so. Those  statements would also have  to  list  the necessary payment to pay off the balance in 12,  24, and 36 months, as well as a toll-free number  to  receive  information about accessing  credit counseling and debt management services.  Credit cardholders have a right to know the  real cost of making only minimum payments.  For that reason, I urge your support for the  amendment.  I would also like to voice my strong support  for the underlying bill. In recent months, Congress has been dominated by rescue and economic recovery legislation. But there are few  better ways  to  instantly help hard-working  Americans than to end costly, abusive credit  card practices.  For  too  long, banks have saddled cardholders with deceptive marketing and  fine  print. The New York Consumer Protection  Board reports that credit card complaints comprise more than a quarter of those it receives,  and cards with debt have an average balance  of $5,700.  Because of unfair practices, one hidden fee  snowballs  into ballooning  interest  rates and  thousand dollar balances  that many  families  struggling  to get by with  today’s economic  challenges cannot afford.

148,House,111,0.311,37,2009-04-30,Mr. SCHOCK.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer  today  is really targeted at reducing  identity theft and ensuring that consumers have the appropriate information they need to make themselves  aware  of  inappropriate  activity  on  their accounts that may be opened in  their name.  As the current legislation stands, it  leaves inactivated credit cards off of  credit reporting altogether. The legislation would allow a potential identity  thief to apply for and obtain numerous  credit cards in someone else’s name,  accruing massive  lines of credit, all  with  the  intention of opening each  credit card at once and simultaneously  spending massive amounts of that victim’s money and then disappearing, as  often is the case, which ruins the victim’s  credit history and oftentimes  costs the victim thousands of dollars.  My amendment ensures consumers  are aware of credit activity made in  their name by removing the requirement that open lines of credit are not  reported to the credit bureaus until the  issued credit card is activated.  Now, identity theft is a real problem.  As an individual who has had my identity stolen, I can tell you that it is also  a very costly problem. Eight million  Americans were victims of  identity  theft  in 2005, and over 2 million of  those 8 million victims were victims  because new accounts were opened in  their names that they were not made  aware of.  The Federal Trade Commission also  states that a quarter of those victims’  problems were  exacerbated  because  they were not made aware of the problems for over 6 months. The underlying  legislation will only exacerbate that  without this amendment.  The Federal Trade Commission goes  on in the report that they encourage  consumers  to  stay vigilant  in protecting  their  identity  through  two  ways; one is monitoring accounts that  you didn’t open and debts on your accounts that you can’t explain. Well,  Mr. Chairman, my amendment does exactly that by ensuring consumers continue to have the information about  these accounts that would otherwise  have been applied in their name but up  until this point would not be noted on  their credit account. Under the 2003  Fair Credit Reporting Act passed by  Congress, consumers are allowed this  information free of charge. And with  the amendment I offer here today, they  will be given that information in advance of any adverse credit effects that  a potential identity thief could be trying.

151,,111,-0.283,44,2009-04-30,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, I am  here this afternoon to strongly oppose  the  Bush-negotiated  Panama  Free  Trade Agreement. We should not even  be considering  this agreement until  Panama fixes its outrageous banking  secrecy, its offshore tax haven, and financial service deregulation policies.  Just when we thought we heard almost everything that there is to know  about AIG’s bailout and bonuses, many  of you may not know AIG  is suing  United States taxpayers, claiming  it  overpaid U.S. taxes on activities  in  Panama.  Panama is a country which applies  low to no regulations and taxes on  firms registered there. AIG wants to  get back those taxes it dodged with its  Panamanian front.  Panama hides its tax liabilities and  transactions behind banking  secrecy  rules. The United States and other  firms can create unregulated subsidiaries with ease in Panama. According  to the State Department, Panama has  over 350,000 foreign-registered companies. AIG is very keen on tax havens  like Panama.  The New York Times just ran an article about how AIG is currently suing  the United States Government for over  $306 million in back taxes it claims it  does not owe because of the Panamanian  company  entitled Starr  International Company, otherwise known as  SICO.  SICO is AIG’s largest shareholder. It  is also the manager of a compensation  fund for AIG employees who are paid in  AIG shares. SICO’s chairman is former  AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg. The  same company that got the government bailout money and used taxpayer  dollars for outrageous bonuses is now  demanding twice the amount of bonuses in paid back taxes.  If you aren’t already angry about the  greed of AIG executives, the fact that  they are using Panama’s tax haven status as a way to sue the American taxpayers  for back taxes  is completely  outrageous. The Bush-negotiated Panama Free Trade Agreement would  make matters worse. It promotes the  offshoring of investment by providing  special treatment for firms who are in  Panama.  At a time of severe economic downturn and when the government is asking the United States taxpayers to foot  the bill for Wall Street’s mess, the last  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—HOUSE April 30, 2009  thing we need to do is pass a trade deal  negotiated by the Bush administration  that promotes offshoring, tax dodging,  and privileges for foreign investors.  This is simply outrageous. As elected  officials of  the people here  in  the  United States, we ought to have transparency in what is going on; and that  transparency  has  not  been  there,  whether it is the bailout legislation or  whether it is looking at the Panama  trade negotiated under the Bush administration which will be a tax haven  for companies who are registered  in  Panama.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  any Panama trade deal that has been  negotiated by the previous administration. It’s wrong. It’s outrageous, and it  is not the right thing to do.  f  b1600  ",2009

How many American jobs must be  lost, how many businesses must be  closed, how many towns across this Nation must be hollowed out before the  government realizes that our trade policy is broken? We have had 15 years of  the NAFTA-based  trade model  on  which the Panamanian agreement  is  based, and the results are in: we now  have a $127 billion annual trade deficit  with Mexico and the other 15 nations  with which we have free trade agreements. Since the passage of NAFTA,  the United States has lost 4.5 million  manufacturing jobs, over 364,000 in my  home State of North Carolina alone.  We are in the worst recession since  the Great Depression. Unemployment  is rising and it may soon be over 10 percent. The last thing this country needs  is another free trade agreement that  will cause more good-paying American  jobs to be outsourced.  Most of us would agree that America  will not recover until we reduce our reliance on imports and produce more of  what we consume right here at home.  The insanity of this agreement is that  it will do just the opposite. In fact, this  agreement actually obligates U.S. taxpayers to fund a New Committee on  Trade Capacity building, one of the primary goals of which, according to CRS,  is to help Panamanian businesses in  ‘‘increasing  exports  to  the United  States.’’  Well, isn’t that nice? At a time when  this government is running a $2 trillion  annual deficit, this agreement will use  U.S. taxpayers’ money not to help U.S.  companies but  to help Panamanian  companies take market share and jobs  from domestic employers.  One  last  point, Madam  Speaker.  President Obama campaigned on and,  in my opinion, carried several States  because of his pledge to stop the incentives for companies to outsource jobs  and dodge U.S. taxation by moving operations offshore to tax-haven jurisdictions like Panama. Unfortunately, this  trade agreement would tear that pledge  to pieces.  The reality is that Panama is known  internationally as one of the leading  tax havens in the world. Corporations  from the United States and around the  globe set up shop in Panama in order  to dodge taxes in their home countries.  Sadly, this agreement does nothing to  stop that activity.  Madam Speaker, this agreement  is  bad for America, especially at this perilous economic time  for our Nation,  and I would encourage the administration to rethink its position before it  asks Congress to approve it.  And with that, Madam Speaker, before I close, with our men and women  fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, I ask  God to please bless our men and women  in uniform, and I ask God three times,  God please, God please, God please continue to bless America.  f  ",2009

So as we recognize  that we co-exist in this global community, it is important for us to go forward thoughtfully and  fairly with a  sense of  justice as we approach the  issues of trade, making certain that  there be this balance, that there be  this fairness in the trade options that  are available to this Nation and others,  and that we move forward in a way  that most progressively  responds  to  the needs of this global community in  which we share our opportunities.

155,Senate,111,0.409,72,2009-04-30,Mr. GRAHAM.," Madam President, I  appreciate what  the  Senator  from  Texas has been saying. This issue of  what to do with the Guantanamo Bay  detainees is a central issue for the Nation and the overall war on terror, because the President is looking for partners. He keeps saying that. I stand  ready to be a partner. The best-run jail  in the world where they are now is  Guantanamo Bay. I have been there  many times. The men and women who  are working in that prison are doing an  outstanding job. They follow the rules.  It  is a model military prison. It  is  tough duty. What  they go  through  every day you probably don’t realize,  and we can’t tell you at all, but it is  tough duty. Anyone serving down there  is doing the country a great service.  Having said that, I understand the  need to change the image of the country. I have been one of the Republicans—a military lawyer for 25 years—  who understands the way we conduct  this war determines whether we will  win it. The high ground in military operations is usually a physical location.  When you are in a battle or a war, you  try to get the high ground, because  that  is the best place to  fight the  enemy from. In this war, it is an ideological struggle, so the high ground is  the moral high ground. It does matter  what we do.  My goal for America is to be the best  we can be. Our enemies—al-Qaida and  other groups—are some of the most  barbaric people in the history of the  world. But here is what it comes down  to. When we capture one of them, it becomes about us. They will cut people’s  heads off in the most brutal fashion,  abuse and humiliate people. They don’t  give  trials. They are not  reasoned.  They are barbarians. The fact that we  choose a different way is not a weakness, it is a strength. Trust me, if we  are going to lead the world to a better  way, we need to show the world a better way. And there is a better way.  In World War II, we had thousands—  350,000, I think—of German and Japanese prisoners housed  in the United  States, Nazis and Japanese prisoners  committed to our destruction. We held  them here under our value  system,  under the Geneva Conventions, in communities all over America. The Nazis  and the Japanese were a tough crowd.  When those prisoners were released,  those who were released, they went  back to their country with a view of  America that helped us form the modern Japan and Germany.  Some of the people we are talking  about at Guantanamo Bay are subject  to war crimes trials. So I am urging  the President to leave on the table the  military commission option. We can  reform it, but let’s not criminalize this  war. They are not accused of robbing a  liquor store. These are not common  criminals.  Under domestic criminal  law, you  cannot hold someone forever without a  trial, nor should you. But under the  law of armed conflict, if you catch a  member of the enemy force, you can  keep them off the battlefield as long as  they present a danger. That has been  military law forever.  I believe we would be better off if we  look at the people who are members of  al-Qaida at Guantanamo Bay as enemy  combatants, part of an unorganized militia, military organization bent on our  destruction, and they are a part of the  enemy force, not some common criminal. We can keep them off the battlefield as long as necessary, but we have  to do it within our value system.  I am urging the President that  if  someone at Guantanamo Bay is subject  to a war crimes trial, let’s don’t go to  Federal court, as we did with the blind  sheik trial in the nineties, which was a  disaster. Let’s put them in a military  tribunal and give them justice through  the military legal system of which I  have been a part for 25 years.  I can tell America one thing: The  judges, the lawyers, and the jurors who  wear the uniform of the United States  are the best among us. These are the  same people who administer justice to  our own troops. It is a great place to  conduct a  trial because we can do  things for national security in a military setting that we cannot do in Federal court. But I can assure you, justice will be rendered and people will be  treated fairly. The courts-martial we  have had, the commission trials we  have had at Guantanamo Bay, we have  seen sentences that make sense.

156,Senate,111,-0.454,79,2009-04-30,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Madam  President, I rise today because I believe the Durbin amendment we are  considering today is more than a tool  for solving America’s current economic  problems, it is the right thing to do for  millions of American homeowners.  Like many of you, I had the opportunity recently to spend 2 weeks with  my constituents talking with people at  townhalls  and  community  get-  togethers around New Mexico. I heard  one message over and over. My constituents feel that too often America  has one set of rules for the rich and  powerful and a different set for working families.  Wall Street can fail and still make  millions. On Main Street, even people  who work hard get dragged down. Irresponsible  lenders thrive while credulous borrowers lose their homes. Everywhere you look, you see middle-class  Americans paying  for other people’s  mistakes. It does not seem fair.  Of course, the law rarely contains an  explicit double standard. But today we  are dealing with a situation in which it  does.  If a real estate speculator borrows  millions to buy a city block and then  finds himself unable to pay, he can  walk into court and ask the judge to  reduce the principal on his loan.  If a working mother borrows $30,000  to buy that first home for her children,  she is stuck with that loan. If she has  lost her job, she is stuck with that  loan. If the value of her house has  plummeted,  she  is  stuck with  that  loan. If she was the victim of predatory  lending, she is stuck with that loan.  I have yet to hear a good reason why  that working American  should not  have the same rights as every real estate  speculator and vacation homeowner in this country. My constituents  do not think that is fair. And you know  they are right.  Sometimes you hear people defend  unfair rules because they are good for  the overall economy. They say that efficiency should be prized over equity.  But that argument does not work here.  By limiting judges’ ability to reduce  the principal on home loans, we are delaying the resolution of this country’s  mortgage crisis. Homeowners continue  to struggle with loans they cannot pay,  and the toxic assets based on those  loans remain on the balance sheets of  America’s financial institutions.  Elizabeth  Warren,  the  head  of  TARP’S  Congressional  Oversight  Panel, has made the point very clearly.  She says:  The law recognizes everywhere the importance, in a financial crisis, of recognizing  losses, taking the hit and moving on.  That is why she supports the mortgage modification  provision we  are  considering today. When judges have  the power to provide a fair resolution  for banks and borrowers, we will be one  step closer to recognizing those losses  in our housing sector, taking the hit,  and moving on. In other words, the  Durbin amendment puts us one step  closer to fixing the financial system.  For this proposal’s benefits will not be  felt primarily on Wall Street. Credit  Suisse estimates that as many as one  in six mortgages in America will be  lost to foreclosure in the next 4 years.  Homeowners know what happens when  a neighbor goes into foreclosure. The  whole neighborhood takes a hit. Property values drop. Local governments  face another drain on their resources.  In some cases, the foreclosed property  becomes a magnet for crime and an  embarrassment to the community.  For most Americans, their home is  their largest investment. The best way  to protect this investment is to stop  unnecessary foreclosures. In my home  State  of New Mexico,  the Durbin  amendment would  protect  an  estimated 6,665 homes and almost $376 million  in  equity. Without  spending a  dime in Federal money, this Congress  can make a significant contribution to  stabilizing my State’s housing market  and keeping thousands of families in  their homes. This  is not  a  tough  choice.  Opponents of  this provision make  two  related  arguments. First,  they  claim a mortgage modification provision will raise the cost of home loans.  Congress has heard testimony about  this issue, and the evidence suggests  otherwise. I will not go too deeply into  this right now, but I encourage you to  look at the testimony before the House  Judiciary Committee of Adam Levitin  of Georgetown University Law Center.  Professor Levitin is one of a chorus of  academics who has poked holes in the  arguments against mortgage modification.  Opponents of mortgage modification  also  argue  that  loan  restructuring  should be handled by bankers and borrowers—not judges. I could not agree  more. Unfortunately, banks have so far  been very reluctant to voluntarily restructure home loans despite a host of  Federal  incentives.  A  considerable  body of evidence suggests that banks  would actually do better if they were  more willing  to  restructure  loans.  Foreclosure is bad for everybody, and  bankruptcy is even worse.  Congress  and  the President  have  worked hard to encourage banks to  modify home loans. We have handed  out carrots like a farmer’s market, and  yet we still have a foreclosure crisis. It  is time to give the homeowners a stick.  The Durbin amendment does not let  every homeowner march into court and  demand a principal reduction. Banks  have  the opportunity  to work with  homeowners  on  a  reasonable  compromise. As long as banks are willing  to negotiate, they will not face a court-  ordered principal reduction.  All this legislation says is that banks  cannot  ignore their borrowers. They  cannot  stand around while working  families struggle with unpayable loans.  That sounds fair to me.

160,,111,-0.495,156,2009-04-30,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today so that my colleagues in the House of  Representatives can join me in congratulating  the Town of Truro, Massachusetts on  the  300th anniversary of  its  incorporation. Since  its founding, Truro has enjoyed a reputation as  a diverse and culturally rich town, whose welcoming  residents  and  awe-inspiring  landscapes are famous throughout New England.  Truro’s history harks back  to November  1620, when the Pilgrims visited the area while  their ship,  the Mayflower, was anchored  in  what is now Provincetown Harbor. It was here  that the Pilgrims found their first fresh water,  and on Corn Hill, overlooking Cape Cod Bay,  the voyagers found a cache of seed corn belonging to the natives which they stole to provide seed  for  their own spring crop. Determining that the land here was unsuitable for  their purposes, the Pilgrims continued up the  coast of  the Cape  to present-day Eastham  and then ventured across the Bay to Plimoth.  On July 16, 1709, the Town of Truro gained  its independence. Formerly a part of Eastham,  the nascent Town encompassed  the district  previously known as Pamet.  During the Revolutionary War, Truro’s militia  demonstrated remarkable skill and bravery in  keeping the British at bay. Once, the members  marched in a circular formation behind a barrier dune to convey the impression that there  was a large force assembled ready to defend  the  town. At  the  time, Provincetown Harbor  was controlled by the British, and there was  no protection for Truro save its own meager  militia.  Truro has a  long and distinguished seafaring history, and at one time had a shipyard  which produced  large vessels  in  the Pamet  River basin. Truro whalers sailing from other  ports ventured as  far as  the Arctic and  the  Falkland  Islands. Ultimately,  the Town  of  Truro’s  intrepid and expert whalers helped  spur an  industry  that became profitable and  culturally significant  throughout coastal New  England.  In fact, much of Truro’s economy was once  dependent on  the  sea. Truro’s men were  whalers, and the shipyard built large commercial vessels  to sustain  their activities. There  were several try works in town to render the  whale blubber  into  lamp oil, and salt works  dotted  the  shores  and  hillsides,  providing  much-needed  salt  to  preserve  the  catch.  These industries—along with subsistence and  commercial  farming—have  been  replaced  largely by  the seasonal  tourist  industry  that  currently fuels the local economy.  Today, slightly more  than 2,100  residents  call Truro home year-round. During the summer months, the tiny Town’s population swells  by an estimated 17,000 to 18,000 people anxious  to experience  the breathtaking scenery  for which Truro is known. More than half of its  landmass  is within  the Cape Cod National  Seashore. Truro’s beaches stretch unbroken  between its borders, offering water access for  swimming, fishing, and boating.  The first lighthouse—what many consider an  icon of Cape Cod—was built in Truro at Highland  in 1797. At  the  time,  the numerous  shoals off the ‘‘great backside’’ claimed many  ships as the prevailing winds and waves drove  vessels to the shore. This original lighthouse  was declared unsafe  in 1857 and a new  tower, still standing and still in-use, was built  to replace it.  Truro, with  its  glorious  sunsets;  noisy,  storm-surf-beaten  beaches;  tranquil,  sunny  berry-laden hills; deliciously refreshing  fresh-  water  springs;  adventuresome  paths;  and  acres of protected National Seashore  land,  has been home or temporary haven to politicians, musicians, puppeteers, pirates, poets,  and ordinary folks. Its people are hardy and  resilient. Tradesmen and professionals, artists  and writers, bards and photographers, fishermen and farmers, retirees and schoolchildren  all  contribute  to  the unique  fabric of  the  Town’s community. Some grew up here; many  others have chosen this special place as their  home.  It  is with pleasure and pride  that  I  join  Truro’s residents on this auspicious day to celebrate all the achievements the Town has accomplished, and all  those  to come. Happy  birthday, Truro. May the years ahead be ever  prosperous and bright.  f  CONGRATULATING  PAUL  GIBLIN,  PATTI  EPLER,  AND  RYAN  GABRIELSON  RECIPIENTS  OF  THE  2009 PULITZER PRIZE FOR  LOCAL REPORTING  HON.

Their hard work and dedicated effort on behalf of The East Valley Tribune are  deserving of  recognition and  should be a  source of pride for the people of Arizona.  The Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting was  first awarded in 1948 to honor journalists who  display  innovation and  knowledge of  their  communities while reporting on important local  issues. The Pulitzer Prize Committee offers  each winner a $10,000 award and a commemorative certificate, but more important is  these journalists have earned the respect and  admiration of their peers and the public.  Paul, Patti, and Ryan have set a new standard for all Arizona journalists with their commitment to excellence through their exhaustive  in-depth reporting on the impact of immigration  enforcement in Arizona. Despite facing tough  conditions with  the downsizing of  the newspaper  industry—both Paul Giblin and Patti  Epler have since been laid off by The Tribune—these  individuals have reminded us all  that  investigative  journalism  is still vital  to  shedding  light on and  informing  the public  about significant  issues  that  face  the nation  today.  It is only the fourth time in Arizona’s history  that a local media organization has won a Pulitzer Prize. More significantly,  it  represents  only the second occasion that a Pulitzer Prize  has been awarded in Arizona for reporting.  Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing Paul, Patti, and Ryan’s achievement  and their continued service to journalism in the  public interest.  f  ADRIAN MURPHY  HON.

163,,111,-0.392,163,2009-04-30,Mr. WEXLER.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to  take a moment  to  recognize  the Florida  Legislature for passing the Dori Slosberg and  Katie Marchetti Safety Belt Law yesterday, a  law giving police the power to stop motorists  for not wearing seat belts. I believe this law is  a great step forward in the effort to reduce the  numbers of tragic deaths and injuries throughout Florida and should serve as an example  for other state governments to follow in ensuring all Americans are safer on our roads.  This measure was long championed by Irv  Slosberg, a  former state representative  from  Boca Raton whose 14-year-old daughter, Dori,  was killed  in a 1996 car crash on Palmetto  Park Road. This accident claimed the lives of  five teens and left four others, including Dori’s  twin sister, with serious injuries. It is unfortunate that such a tragedy needed to occur for  people in our community to take notice of the  need to amend the law to ensure people are  wearing their seat belts, but Irv Slosberg deserves a tremendous amount of praise for his  dedication  to ensuring other  families do not  suffer from such a tragedy.  Along with his efforts  in  the Florida State  House to introduce this bill, Irv Slosberg also  introduced the Dori Slosberg Driver Education  Safety Act, which became  law  in Florida  in  2002 and allows Florida counties to fund driver education programs by adding a surcharge  to traffic tickets. In addition, recognizing that  teen traffic crashes are the number one cause  of death in Florida, Irv Slosberg also founded  the Dori Slosberg Foundation, with a mission  statement to educate the public about the importance of traffic safety; promote the usage  of safe driving habits, especially seat belt  compliance and proper child restraint devices;  support and advance driver’s education programs nationwide; assist  the Florida Department of Transportation to ensure a safe driving environment on our  roadways; and distribute tools to both teens and seniors to help  them drive safely. These initiatives, along with  his personal dedication  to  the  issue of road  safety, have no doubt saved and will continue  to save countless lives in our community.  As a co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety, I understand the  impact road crashes have on the global community, and while we must continue to work to  establish protocols with nations around  the  world  to reduce  the number of road deaths  and injuries globally, we must also set an example here in the United States by passing  laws to ensure safety belts, which have been  credited with saving countless lives since they  were made standard  in U.S. automobiles  in  1968, are being used by all who get behind  the wheel, especially our children.  I want to once again congratulate the Florida Legislature for passing this bill, and I look  forward to Governor Charlie Crist’s signing this  into law in the near future. I also want to once  again  extend  my  appreciation  for  Irv  Slosberg’s efforts, both while he served in the  Florida Legislature and as a member of the  South Florida community, to ensure our loved  ones remain safe on the roads.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE  CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 29, 2009  ",2009
164,,111,-0.565,163,2009-04-30,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to introduce a bill to address two  matters that are critically important to the future of this country: health care and the health  of our local economies.  In almost all states, an inmate in a county  jail or  juvenile detention  facility  loses  their  Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP or SSI benefits  during  their  incarceration—even  if  they have  not been convicted of a crime. The United  States leads the world in the number of people who are incarcerated and federal law requires government entities to provide medical  services  to all  inmates. High  incarceration  rates,  chronic  conditions,  substance abuse  treatment, mental  illness, and aging prison  populations have contributed  to  the  rise  in  health care costs for inmates.  Madam Speaker, providing health care for  inmates constitutes a major portion of local jail  operating costs. Nearly two thirds of all jail inmates are awaiting court action or have not  been convicted of the crime they have been  charged with. Over half of jail inmates who receive financial support from government agencies prior to their arrest have physical and/or  mental health problems. Requiring county governments  to cover health care costs  for  inmates who have not been convicted. This  places an unnecessary burden on local governments, which have been negatively  impacted by recession, widespread budget deficits, and cuts to safety-net programs and other  essential services.  Stripping  inmates of Medicare, Medicaid,  SCHIP and SSI benefits also violates the presumption of innocence which is at the heart of  our criminal justice system. The failure to distinguish between persons who are awaiting  disposition of charges and persons who have  been  duly  convicted  goes  against  the  foundational tenets of our justice system.  Disadvantaged  populations  are  further  harmed by this situation. Low-income and minority populations are often unable  to post  bond, which would allow them to continue to  receive benefits from the federal government.  The facts are clear and all too familiar. Black  men are  three  times more  likely  than Hispanics and five times more likely than whites  to be in jail. Black women are more than twice  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:33 May 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K30AP8.011 E30APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
165,,111,-0.606,170,2009-04-30,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  today  in strong support of H.R. 1913,  rise  the  Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation  because we must do all that we can to protect  those who are injured because of their gender,  sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.  Hate crimes can occur in any community—  even one as wonderful and diverse as mine.  On July 4, 1999—when we should have been  celebrating the welcoming and embracing traditions of our great country, my district was  rocked by  the killing spree of  the white supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. This  madman left us grieving for Ricky Byrdsong, a  former Northwestern University coach, a well-  known community  leader, a deeply religious  man, a man who was committed to his family.  His only crime was the color of his skin—he  was African-American. Smith also murdered  Won Joon Yoon, an Asian American student  from Indiana.  The bill we are considering today takes an  important step toward making America a more  just society, by closing a glaring loophole in  our justice system that prevents the Federal  Government  from prosecuting cases where  women, gay, transgender or disabled persons  are victims of bias-motivated crimes for who  they are. These crimes not only devastate victims and their family and friends, but they devastate the community to which the victim belongs by creating fear and intimidation. Hate  crimes chip away at the very foundations of  what  it means  to be an American—that all  people are created equal and are afforded the  same freedoms and protections.  America must no longer ignore hate crimes  of any kind. Everyone, regardless of race, sexual, orientation and gender identity, must be  equal in the eyes of the law. The passage of  H.R. 1913 will send the powerful message that  America stands  for  tolerance and  inclusion,  and is opposed to prejudice in all its forms. I  want  to  thank my good  friend, Congresswoman TAMMYBALDWIN, and the entire LGBT  Equality Caucus for their tireless work to get  this bill passed and urge my colleagues  to  vote ‘‘yes’’ to H.R. 1913.  f  CREDIT CARDHOLDERS’ BILL OF  RIGHTS ACT OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON.

166,,111,0.379,170,2009-04-30,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Chair,  I am disappointed  that Congressman MURPHYand I will not have  the opportunity to offer our amendment to the  Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights Act which  would require credit card companies to report  on marketing agreements with  institutions of  higher education and alumni associations. The  amendment also would direct the Government  Accountability Office to analyze and report to  Congress  the  impact of  these arrangements  on student credit card debt. To that end, today  we will be introducing this amendment as a  stand-alone  bill,  the Student Credit Card  Transparency Act of 2009.  According  to a recent study, students are  now graduating with an average credit card  debt of more than $4,100, up from $2,900 just  four years ago. The average number of cards  per student has grown to 4.6, with over half of  college students reporting  they have  four or  more cards. The combined  impact of credit  card debt and growing student loan debt can  greatly limit a student’s future career choice.  Furthermore, compounding debt from late payments and high penalties can  further  jeopardize a young person’s  financial  future by  making it difficult to take out their first mortgage, buy a car or even rent an apartment.  As I’m sure we all know through our own  experiences or through our children’s, college  students have become prime targets for credit  card marketing  campaigns. Most  students  enter college without a credit card and are  quickly saturated with e-mails, direct mailings  and on-campus solicitations to sign up for their  first credit card. A recent report by the U.S.  Public Interest Research Group revealed that,  of the students they surveyed, 80 percent said  they had received mail from credit card companies. Students reported receiving an average of nearly  five mailed  solicitations per  month. In addition, 22 percent of students reported  receiving an average of nearly  four  phone calls per month from credit card companies.  While the practice of targeting college students may not be much of a surprise, students  and parents may be alarmed  to  learn  that  many colleges, universities and alumni associations have entered  into  lucrative agreements with these companies to allow exclusive  marketing of  their cards.  In  these arrangements, schools receive large cash payments  in exchange for handing over their students’  contact information—such as address, e-mail  address, and telephone numbers. These confidential agreements may also go further and  give companies exclusive face-to-face access  to students on campus, such as during sporting events or at the student union. Some provide  the university or alumni with additional  money based on a percentage of purchases  using the card.  Despite  the  fact  that hundreds of schools  throughout  the country have such arrangements, very little is known about them. Last  year’s ‘‘pay to play’’ scandal in the guaranteed  student loan program exposed the practice of  lenders and financial aid administrators putting  their own  interests ahead of  their students’  when  it came  to compiling  their  ‘‘preferred  lender  list.’’ While  arrangements  between  credit card companies and schools don’t necessarily mean the student’s financial interests  are being harmed, I believe it is imperative to  have at a minimum a better understanding of  these arrangements. For instance, are schools  and associated  foundations making arrangements with companies that offer the best rates  for their students?  This bill simply seeks greater transparency  by requiring credit card companies  to report  these arrangements. Then Congress, students  and parents will be able  to  judge whether  these agreements reflect the best interests of  students or that of the school or related institution.  I am happy  to have  the support of  the  United States Students Association, USPIRG,  Consumer Federation of America, National Association of College Admissions Counselors,  and  the American Association of Collegiate  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:33 May 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30AP8.037 E30APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 s d o o w w         ",2009
167,,111,-0.306,177,2009-04-30,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the  Telephone Excise Tax Repeal Act of 2009,  which  I  introduced  today  along with Mr.  THOMPSONof Pennsylvania. The telephone tax  is deceptive, archaic, unfair and regressive.  This tax was first imposed in 1898 to fund  U.S.  involvement  in  the Spanish American  War. That conflict is long over, and now elimination of this tax is long overdue. But it is not  for want of trying.  Similar pieces of legislation have won bipartisan support  in previous sessions of Congress—127 cosponsors in the 110th Congress  and 220 in the 109th Congress—but have routinely been stalled. Let’s not let that happen  again.  I suspect many Americans would be surprised to learn that they are paying a three  percent tax on their local telephone, toll, and  teletype exchange services. As an excise tax,  there is no direct payment made to the government;  the  tax  is collected by  the phone  companies and remitted to the federal government.  Although  the amount  is  itemized on each  phone bill, it is one of many taxes, fees and  surcharges  listed and can be easily overlooked on the multiple pages of an average  telephone bill.  With advances in technology, this tax has  become punitive for those without the ability,  financial means or desire to upgrade their telecommunications services. Cellular phone and  long distance landline telephone services were  exempted from the tax in 2006. Bundled services that do not differentiate between local and  long distance services, such as Voice over  Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, also are exempt. The only service still being subjected to  this antiquated tax is local telephone service,  which is the predominant means of communication used by  the disabled,  lower-income  families and senior citizens.  Eliminating  this  regressive  tax would be  consistent with  the actions we already have  taken so far in this Congress to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax relief to hard  working Americans.  I ask my colleagues  to  join us in hanging up on the telephone tax.  f  HONORING DANIEL C. GILLIAM  HON. C.A.

168,,111,-0.296,177,2009-04-30,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Madam Speaker, I  rise before you  today  to honor Daniel C.  Gilliam upon his retirement from the position  of Deputy Senior Acquisition Executive at the  National Security Agency (NSA). In this position Mr. Gilliam has been responsible for all of  NSA’s acquisitions and management of  the  Acquisition Directorate’s senior leadership. Mr.  Gilliam oversees all procurements,  liaisons  with key  industry partners, and directs  resources  to optimize  the organization’s effectiveness. Working closely with Acquisition’s  customers, Mr. Gilliam maintains  strategic  partnerships with NSA’s mission elements to  ensure their needs and requirements are met.  After earning a Bachelor’s degree in Business Management  from  the University  of  Maryland, and a Master’s degree in Public Administration from the George Washington University in 1979, Mr. Gilliam graduated from the  Industrial College of  the Armed Forces  in  1993. He also attended the Federal Executive  Institutes Leadership for a Democratic Society  Program in 1996.  In 1976, Daniel began his career at NSA as  a management support intern. Since then, he  has worked on a variety of acquisition and  contracting positions  to  include  contracting  specialist, contracting officer, and cost/price  analyst as well as managing those same disciplines.

169,House,111,-0.33,4,2009-05-13,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, Americans  are an optimistic people. That was confirmed yesterday when results came  out showing that Americans believe, by  a 2–1 margin, that we will grow clean  energy jobs by the millions when we  adopt a clean energy bill in this House,  and they are right.  We should be optimistic that we are  going to build electric cars and sell  them to the rest of the world, not just  China. We ought to be optimistic that  we are going  to build concentrated  solar energy technology and sell it to  the rest of the world.  We ought to be optimistic that we  are going to build the electric batteries  that will fuel our cars and help make  our grid more responsive.  This is the optimism that those of us  have who are going to pass a clean energy bill this year to make this happen.  Here is another reason for optimism.  Yesterday we reached a consensus in  the House Energy and Commerce Committee. With broad  swathes of  the  country,  the  south-north  industrial  egg, we have reached a consensus that  we are going to grow jobs everywhere  in this country because we are the optimists, and the optimists are going to  win this clean energy debate.  f  REFORM OUR HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

172,House,111,-0.115,18,2009-05-13,Mr. MATHESON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of H.R. 2187, the 21st Century Green  High-Performing Public School Facilities Act,  which will help modernize many of our nation’s  schools.  I would  like  to  thank my colleague  from  Kentucky—BEN CHANDLER—for his sponsorship of this legislation. I believe it will help to  ensure that our children can learn in healthier,  more cost effective, and more energy-efficient  schools.  An investment in education and educational  facilities is critical. As the father of two young  boys, I want to know that they will receive a  quality education  in a safe school building.  Too many of our nation’s schools are outdated, and some are even unsafe.  I would also like to thank Chairman MILLER  for including my amendment to this bill in the  manager’s amendment. My amendment will  allow schools to prioritize projects that eliminate  asbestos,  polychlorinated  biphenyls,  mold, mildew,  lead-based hazards, or other  known carcinogens.  Extensive research has shown that children  and  teachers  perform  better  in  ‘‘green’’  schools. Our children already encounter many  challenges, and we should do everything we  can to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for them.  ",2009
173,,111,0.494,25,2009-05-13,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," I yield myself  as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment  is  simple, straightforward and hopefully  noncontroversial. It adds a bit of accountability to this legislation by requiring  the  Institute  of Education  Sciences within  the Department  of  Education to study the impact the Federal school construction dollars have  on the institutions that are receiving  the funds.  I know proponents of this legislation  will say that school construction does  impact performance, and they may be  correct. I am skeptical of the claim. So  I am asking  for the opportunity to  study the effects of school construction  on student performance.  This amendment would require the  institute to issue a report a year after  the schools have  issued construction  funding and  report  the  impact  the  funding has. I am hopeful that such a  report could provide valuable insights  into the best use of taxpayer dollars.  I know Mr. CUELLARwanted to be  here today to speak in favor. It’s nice  to have bipartisan support for accountability.  I urge adoption of the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009

175,,111,-0.106,25,2009-05-13,Mr. ELLSWORTH.," Mr. Chairman, I  have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate  the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. ELLSWORTH:  OF In section 309, redesignate subsection (c) as  subsection (d).  In section 309, insert after subsection (b)  the following:  (c) RULE CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing  in  this section shall be construed to prohibit a  local educational agency from using sustainable,  domestic  hardwood  lumber  as  ascertained through the forest inventory and  analysis program of the Forest Service of the  Department of Agriculture under the Forest  and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641 et seq.) for  public school modernization, renovation, repairs, or construction.  In section 310(a)(5)(C)(ii), insert ‘‘and renewable’’ after ‘‘sustainable’’.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 427, the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. ELLSWORTH) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Indiana.  ",2009
176,House,111,-0.343,32,2009-05-13,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Just to speak to  this amendment, let’s be really clear  here. The purpose of our amendment,  of course, is to actually enhance this  bill by creating more opportunities for  energy savings. Every time we save  dollars for a school, we save dollars for  our school district, we save dollars for  our taxpayers.  This bill is smart. It is to make energy efficiency investments that will  save taxpayers dollars. In addition, it  will help to educate our young people  in the positive aspects of greening. It is  extremely important to understand the  purpose of planting a tree is not only  because it looks good, but it in fact can  save on energy costs. Planting vegetables is done not only because it is a fun  thing to do, but it actually can put  food on the table that is healthy and  nutritious.  All of this is part of what we are trying to do in this bill, create energy savings for our children, for our school  districts and for our taxpayers. I encourage support of this amendment and  the underlying bill.  I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).  ",2009
177,House,111,-0.297,32,2009-05-13,Mr. ANDREWS., The committee supports this bill. The bill requires the  money be spent for academic purposes.  I don’t know really how you teach biology effectively without giving children  the chance to interact with plant life.  I think it just makes an awful lot of  sense to have that kind of lab.  We support the bill and urge a ‘‘yes’’  vote.  ,2009

180,House,111,0.493,39,2009-05-13,Mr. BARTLETT.," I strongly encourage my colleagues to pass H.R. 2101, a  much needed acquisition reform bill.  This bill will help facilitate a strong  national defense, while reining in out-  of-control cost growth in the development of major weapons systems.  This bill is a result of an intensive,  cooperative, and collaborative bipartisan and bicameral effort to improve  and modernize the procurement and acquisition process for our Armed Forces.  I want to recognize in particular the  efforts  of  Chairman  Ranking Member JOHNMCHUGH, and  the members of the Defense Acquisition Reform Panel  led by Chairman  ROBERTANDREWSand Ranking Member  SKELTON,  IKE MIKECONAWAY.  Additionally, I would like to thank  the unusually talented staff for their  tireless work and contributions to this  legislation.  H.R. 2101 is a much needed response  to help minimize cost overruns and increase oversight and transparency in  the way the Defense Department buys  big-ticket weapons programs. I’m confident this legislation will provide a  positive step forward for our military  that will save taxpayers billions of dollars.  Moreover, this piece of  legislation  strategically addresses many of  the  issues I have long raised as concerns,  including requirements creep, delivery  delays,  overly  optimistic  cost  estimates, and the need for an independent  broker to advise the military and Congress.  Two weeks ago during our HASC full  committee hearing on Reform of Major  Weapons Systems Acquisition, I posed  a question before our distinguished  panel of experienced acquisition experts regarding how they would weigh  the causes of program cost overruns.  I asked them to record percentages  based on what I called requirements  creep,  intentional underbidding, and,  three, optimistic or incompetent cost  estimating.  In short, what I took away from our  expert panelists’ answers was that fixing a broken defense acquisition system heavily lies with the requirements  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:40 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13MY7.099 H13MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 7 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2009

182,House,111,-0.119,46,2009-05-13,Mr. CARNEY.," I thank the gentleman.  I rise, obviously, in support of this  bill. I do want to thank my good friend  and shipmate, MARKKIRK, for working  so hard across the aisle to get this  done. It is always very heartening in  this body when we can do the right  thing, and this truly is the right thing  to do. It’s a commonsense approach  that actually recognizes the members  of the Armed Forces who have earned a  Medal of Honor and provides a chance  for the Medal of Honor Foundation to  fill its coffers and continue to do the  good work that it always intended to  do.  The Medal of Honor was first authorized by Congress in 1861 as the United  States Navy’s highest personal decoration. At that time, the Army and Air  Force also created Medals of Honor to  award their members.  There have been a total of 3,447 recipients of the Medal of Honor. And as  my good friend, Mr. KIRK, said, only 97  are living today.  I am proud to represent a district in  Pennsylvania. And  I will have you  know that Pennsylvania is second only  to New York State in Medal of Honor  recipients.  It is my hope that these coins issued  under this act will serve as a reminder  of the importance of this medal and of  the acts these brave men and women  performed.  The  surplus of  funds  raised  from  these coins will benefit the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, a  not-for-profit  organization  chartered  by the 85th Congress under legislation  signed into law by Dwight Eisenhower  on August 14, 1958.  The Congressional Medal of Honor  Foundation  is  dedicated  to  perpetuating the Medal of Honor’s  legacy  through outreach and collaborative efforts. It also raises funds for initiatives  that promote the values that the Medal  of Honor represents, which is courage,  sacrifice, and patriotism.  Some of the examples of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation activities include working with the staff  of the Smithsonian National Museum  of American History  to establish a  dedicated Medal of Honor exhibit as  part of the larger permanent exhibit  called ‘‘The Price of Freedom.’’ They  also  established  a Medal  of Honor  scholarship program  for outstanding  students enrolled in the Reserve Officer  Training Corps programs for the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marines. Collaborating in the production  of two Medal of Honor documentaries  released in 2006; one,  ‘‘The Medal of  Honor,’’ produced by PBS, and two,  ‘‘The Medal,’’ syndicated for television  across the United States. Established  an Above & Beyond Citizen Honors program to recognize ordinary Americans  who have exhibited in their daily lives  the  same  ideals  that  the Medal of  Honor recipients displayed in combat.  The President of  the United States  joined the Medal of Honor recipients in  the laying of a wreath at the Tomb of  the Unknowns this year to initiate the  Above & Beyond Citizen Honor ceremonies.  Finally, the  foundation distributed  more than 53,000 copies of the book  ‘‘Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor  Beyond the Call of Duty’’ to public and  private school students in every State.  These efforts deserve our  support,  and so do the men and women who  have been awarded the Medal of Honor.  I urge my fellow Members to support  this bill to help ensure that the legacy  of the men and women whose brave  acts earned them the Medal of Honor  will be remembered.  ",2009
183,House,111,0.612,67,2009-05-13,Mr. AKIN.," Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to join you this evening here in the  Chamber and talk for a while about  what I think a very interesting subject  to many, many Americans. If they’re  not interested in it now, they will be  rapidly as this issue develops here in  Washington, D.C.  What we’re talking about is, most  specifically, the background on a thing  that’s called cap-and-trade or cap-and-  tax. And ‘‘cap-and-tax’’ is probably a  better name for it because what we’re  talking about is a very, very large tax  increase that is to be justified because  of the great danger, the imminent peril  that is created by global warming—although that has now been called sometimes  ‘‘climate  change,’’  or  global  warming, or other various names. And  soon the Legislature is going to actually be doing the debating and the voting on this very, very large tax increase.  Now, the President promised people  that there would be no one making  $250,000 or less who is going to get any  tax increases. But, unfortunately, this  tax increase hits all Americans; even  the average household will be paying  thousands of dollars more.  The President promised that nobody  making $250,000 or less was going to get  any tax increases. Well, we have seen  that is not true, and particularly with  this cap-and-tax situation, the tax on  all kinds of people in the country. In  fact,  every  time you  turn  a  light  switch on, you would be paying a tax.  So I don’t think we can take the President seriously on that promise.  Now, the justification for this very  large tax increase is the popular subject of global warming, or  climate  change, or whatever. And that is the  general idea that mankind is making  CO2—that’s  the  product  of  burning  something. When you burn something,  the oxygen in the atmosphere combines  with the fuel and it makes CO2. It’s the  bubbles in soda pop. So we drink CO2,  as a matter of fact. And in a sense, the  soda pop manufacturer is sequestering  the CO2 in bottles of soda pop and you  are letting it loose when you open the  can. Anyway, the theory is that CO2 is  the culprit, and therefore we have to  reduce the amount of CO2. And so this  tax is being justified to reduce CO2so  the planet won’t burn up. That’s the  fast version of it.  So what I thought I would do this  evening is to give just a little bit of a  historic perspective because sometimes  when you go into one of these debates,  it’s interesting to take a look and see,  you know, are we the first people that  have ever been talking about this, or is  there a historic perspective of some  kind on it? And I found that the historic  perspective here  is  somewhat  amusing and kind of  interesting. So  I’m going to take you back to the year  1920. At that time, in 1920, the newspapers were filled with scientific warnings of a fast-approaching glacial age.  So in 1920, the scientists were saying  that the planet was going to get really  cold, there was going to be glaciers  running around all over, so we need to  be prepared for very wintry weather because there are glaciers that are going  to blow around. So that is 1920.  1930s; the predominant scientists at  the time reversed themselves to the  fact that in the near future there is  going to be what they called ‘‘serious  global warming.’’ So from the twenties  to the thirties, the scientists changed.  In 1972, Time magazine cited numerous  scientific reports of  imminent  ‘‘run-  away glacial activities.’’ So now we’ve  gone from global warming to glacial  activities again in 1972.  In  1975, Newsweek  says, Scientific  evidence of a great ice age, and we were  being called to stockpile  food, that  maybe what we should be considering  doing was melting the ice packs, the  icecaps at the North and South Poles  to try to stop this tremendous ice age  that was coming in 1972 and 1975. But  in 1976, the U.S. Government says the  Earth is headed into some sort of mini-  ice age.  b1830  So this was continued through the  seventies, and now we’ve gone back to  global warming.  So over a period of the last hundred  years or so, the major scientists—at  least the ones that were talking out on  this subject—have reversed themselves  three times. I think it gives us some  cause to be a little cautious before we  jump into a massive tax increase to  deal with a problem that has been coming around for the last 100 years, either  getting too hot or too cold.  Now  there were  statements made  today that say that there is complete  agreement that we have global warming and all of the major scientists all  agree and the time for debate is over.  Particularly,  I’m  quoting,  in  1992,  going back to ’92, Al Gore made this  statement, quote, Only an insignificant  fraction of scientists deny the global  warming crisis. The time for debate is  over.  Let’s do this quote again. 1992, Al  Gore says, ‘‘Only an insignificant fraction  of  scientists  deny  the  global  warming crisis. The time for debate is  over.’’ Yet in that same year a Gallup  poll said that 53 percent of scientists  involved—these are the scientists that  are involved in the climate change debates and questions—only 53 percent of  them didn’t agree that there was going  to  be  global warming,  30  percent  weren’t sure, and only 17 percent believed that global warming had begun  in the year 1992.  Moving closer to our own time period, just last year you have in The  Wall Street Journal a report by an MIT  professor, Richard Lindzen, says—this  is his quote, There is no consensus on  global warming.  Now when he made that statement,  boy, did he get beat up. All the media  and all kinds of people were all over  him saying, that was a reckless thing  to say that there’s no consensus on the  subject, which  led  him,  after  he’d  taken a tremendous amount of political flak, to say that it seems that  global warming is more of a political  issue than it is a scientific or technical  one. And that was the professor from  MIT’s opinion in that regard.  So that’s just to try to give us a little bit of an introduction to obviously  what is a controversial question. Even  if global warming were widely believed  to be true by scientists, then there are  a whole series of other questions that  have to be asked. Can we do anything  about it? Should we pass a huge and  massive  tax  increase?  Is  that necessary? So that’s what we’re going to  talk about.  We’re joined, as usual, by some really  capable people that have taken some  time to look into this issue, and I am  absolutely delighted to introduce one  of those to you now, and that is Congressman LATTAfrom Ohio.

It’s an issue that I think  every American had better learn about  quickly.  I did a teletown hall last night, and  we discussed it quite a bit because in  my area we’re hurting. Just to kind of  give you a little bit of background on  my area, according to the National  Manufacturers Association, I represent  the largest manufacturing district in  the State of Ohio. Last summer I represented the ninth largest in Congress,  but because of what’s happened with  the economy and jobs, I now represent  the 13th largest manufacturing district  in Congress.

185,House,111,0.267,74,2009-05-13,Mr. TURNER.," Well, I want to thank  BRADMILLER for his leadership on this  issue. This is a very important issue  that affects our whole country. And we  all took a pause as we saw our financial  institutions  shaken  nationally.  And as the bailouts were proposed that  came here to this floor to be voted  upon, across the country, Americans  wondered, How did we get here? How  did this happen?  Now I voted against every bailout  that came here to this floor. And I  voted against it because not only did I  believe that they were not structured  appropriately, that there was money  that was going to be wasted, but more  importantly, not one of them included  a change in the laws that would prohibit the type of practices that got us  here to begin with. The toxic assets  that people talk about are these mortgage-backed securities that were traded and sold upstream. They were the  securities that were based upon practices of mortgage lending that had a  negative impact on our families and a  negative impact on our communities.  And today I wanted to offer my support for the recently passed bill, H.R.  1728, Mr. MILLER’s bill, the Mortgage  Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending  Act of 2009. This bill directly addresses  the root causes of the current financial  and  economic  crisis  in  the United  States as well as how it has led to some  home  abandonment  and  high  foreclosure rates throughout the country.

186,House,111,-0.256,88,2009-05-13,Mr. HODES.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague, Mr. TONKO, and I join him in  voicing my  support  for  President  Obama’s plan to limit dangerous carbon emissions, put us on a path to energy security, and create millions of  American clean energy jobs. Right now  Americans realize that our American  energy policy is not working. The last  administration gave billions of dollars  in tax subsidies to oil companies despite the fact that they were earning  record profits, and despite their willingness to gouge the American people.  We clearly need a new energy policy  that invests in renewable energy that  will be cheaper for American families  and will be homegrown, American energy that will create jobs and lead the  world in a 21st century energy economy.  Right now we are facing the most severe economic crisis in a generation,  the most severe economic crisis since  the Great Depression; and at the same  time, our scientists are clearly telling  us that our inaction is threatening the  planet.  Fortunately, by Congress taking one  single action and passing what will  come to the floor as climate legislation, we will take a giant leap towards  mending both of our problems. The  President has  laid out an ambitious  agenda, recognizing that as Americans  we can do great things when we come  together and work together  for the  common good. The President has presented us with a clean energy jobs plan  that will:  create new,  21st  century  American jobs throughout the product-  supply chain; protect existing jobs; reduce our dependence on  foreign oil;  save money on energy costs for American taxpayers in the long run; reduce  carbon pollution, and, with it, combat  the  dangerous  effects  of  climate  change.  By forcing those who have long polluted our air and water for free to finally pay for their carbon pollution, we  will begin to shift away from our dependence on dirty, outdated, obsolete  energy technology.  Instead, we will provide  incentives  for American business. We are going to  unleash the American entrepreneurial  spirit and create clean energy jobs. We  will lead the world in technology and  manufacturing that will drive a new,  much more prosperous energy economy.  Think of the cost savings. This plan  to shift American energy production to  domestic alternative sources like solar  and wind and biomass, which means  wood in New Hampshire where I come  from, will be cheaper and cleaner and  will save Americans billions of dollars  in the long run.  By forcing our Nation to tackle climate change and develop new energy,  the plan will create millions of new  jobs and whole new industries here in  the United States, employing everyone  from construction workers to secretaries to salespeople to engineers. It  will open new markets  for us. Just  imagine what it is like if we can become the world leaders in renewable  and alternative energy. Think of the  products  and  services we  can  sell  around the globe and the goodwill we  will get.  Inaction  is no  longer  an  option.  Doing nothing about climate change  will cost exponentially more than the  President’s plan. One respected study  on this says that inaction could end up  costing between 5 and 20 percent of the  total world GDP. We must act.  Now, my friends on the other side of  the aisle are either scared of change,  pessimistic about the American entrepreneurial spirit, or are denying the  scientific consensus because they rely  on campaign funds from oil and coal interests. The truth remains, we must  act.  President Obama’s plan provides the  support and incentives needed to help  the American can-do spirit of innovation and creativity to build the new  clean technologies of the future.  Just as we led the world in developing  the automobile and  the computer, we will once again  lead  the  world  in  developing  new,  cheaper,  cleaner technologies to lead the world  for the 21st century. In addition, we  will provide  lower-income Americans  with a clean energy tax credit to assist  them in this transition to a prosperous  new clean energy economy.  I have proposed we have a commission to make sure that Congress knows  the  impact on small businesses and  low- and moderate-income folks of the  climate change legislation that we are  going to pass.  We are already  feeling the effects  around this country of a changing climate. We ignored the warnings of the  experts of the risks for far too long. We  have learned the dangers, and the costs  are mounting to clean up the mess  after the crisis has hit. We need to act  as good stewards of the Earth. The  American people are trusting us to act  to protect our children and our grandchildren and to be stewards of the public trust. We need to remember that  there will be tremendous unsustainable  economic costs of dealing with the impacts of climate change once they have  occurred  because  Mother  Nature  doesn’t do bailouts.  So let me conclude by rejecting the  charge of those who would defend the  polluters and put our kids at risk.  They  are  simply wrong. President  Obama’s clean energy plan is the opposite of a tax increase. It is regulating  polluters to protect our country, protect our environment, create jobs, invest  in American business, and save  American families money via a direct  tax credit and increased energy efficiency.

187,Senate,111,-0.473,109,2009-05-13,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, I commend my chairman, the distinguished  Senator from Connecticut, for his work  on the legislation before us today. This  has been a complex issue. The chairman has worked very hard to bring  people together on all sides. I commend  also the senior Senator from Alabama  for his vital engagement on these reforms that touch the wallet or the  pocketbook of virtually every American. America needs credit card reform.  Take the case of Maggie Bagon, a 59-  year-old social worker from Salem, OR.  As reported in the Oregonian, Maggie  used her card conservatively. She paid  her bills on time. So she was incensed  when her credit card company charged  her a late fee.  So she called up the bank. They told  her  the  terms of her contract permitted them to sit on her payment for  10 days before they posted it to her account, and that made  it  feasible—in  fact, lawful—for them to charge her a  late fee when she paid her bill early.  That  type of practice  is a  scam.  Maggie and thousands of Oregonians,  perhaps millions of Americans, have  been charged late fees for paying their  credit cards early. That kind of deception and trickery has to end.  Late fees for early payments is not  the only type of scam we have had in  this  industry. How  about  interest  charges on balances that have been  paid off? Well, you have paid it off, and  you are very happy about that. You are  now free of interest? No, you are not—  not under the rules of the fine print in  many credit card agreements.  How about fees for going over the  limit when you do not know you are  over the limit? Well, it used to be you  were simply turned down and that was  fine because that was the deal you had  and you understood the deal. But now  suddenly you  get your  credit  card  statement, and you find out you were  charged a $30 fee when you bought a  newspaper with a credit card or you  were charged a $30 fee when you bought  a $5 meal with your credit card because  the bank was not going to tell you  about the fee because they wanted to  collect those fees for going over the  limit.  Well, this act will fix that problem,  that type of scam on the American  worker. In fact, credit card companies  have even charged fees for making your  payments at all. Some charge fees for  paying with a check. Some charge fees  for paying over  the  Internet. Some  charge fees for paying by telephone.  That is simply crazy, and this act will  address these types of tricks and traps  that have become key and central to  the industry.  As a member of the Oregon House of  Representatives  and  as  speaker,  I  worked with my colleagues to reform  lending practices in our home State.  We tried to address credit card practices to establish fair rules of the road,  and our  legal counsel said: No, you  can’t do that here at the State level.  You have to do that at the Federal  level. It is federally preempted. So we  were not able to help people such as  Maggie, the citizens of our State, have  fair practices. Only the Federal Government, under Federal law, can make  these changes.  But if we all have reserved to ourselves the power to set fair practices,  then we have a moral obligation to set  those fair practices. We have an obligation on behalf of the millions of American citizens such as Maggie. That is  why this legislation is so important.  It is strong, commonsense legislation  which targets the most abusive practices. In particular, I am proud it prohibits ‘‘universal default’’ on existing  balances—that bait-and-switch  tactic  when, under the deal you have signed  up for, you are charged 7 percent, but  after you make those charges, your interest rate is suddenly switched to 29  percent.  I am proud this bill requires that  payments beyond the minimum monthly payment be applied to the balances  with the highest rate of interest.  I am proud this bill limits the aggressive solicitation of young persons; that  it prohibits fees based on the method of  payment, be it telephone, mail, Internet or otherwise; that it prohibits over-  the-limit fees unless a person opts in to  that  feature—it  is a  fair deal, you  choose it—and that it prohibits late  fees if the card issuer delayed posting  the payment.  These long-overdue, commonsense reforms are  important  steps  to bring  transparency and  fairness  to  credit  card contracts. These reforms will help  Maggie and millions such as her from  Connecticut to Oregon and everywhere  in between.  Friends, this legislation is also good  for our banking system. There is one  clear lesson we have learned this year;  that is, fair lending results in families  who are on a solid foundation, strong  consumers, and it avoids the sort of  securitization that results  in poison  pills being based on fraudulent, deceptive practices, poison pills that infect  our banks and  financial  institutions  around the world.  Even the banks are aware this system is flawed, and some have tried to  offer  better,  safer  cards. But  they  found  it hard to differentiate themselves. Why is that? Well, here is why.  It is pretty straightforward. Consumers  do not have the time or patience to  read the dozens of pages of fine print  that come in a credit card contract and  then to compare its terms—and be able  to evaluate its terms—to the dozens of  pages that come with another credit  card.  But even if a person dedicated a week  of their life to comparing two credit  card contracts, it would not matter because, at the end of the contract, it  says: These terms can be changed at  the discretion of the credit card company  at  any  time. And  they  are  changed frequently. Therefore, the contract does not give you the ability to  compare and contrast. Therefore, we  have a dysfunctional market because  consumers are not able to choose better cards with better practices.  We need to create a functional market where there is competition—competition not based on how many tricks  VerDate Nov 24 2008  01:14 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13MY6.014 S13MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l e b j         ",2009

192,,111,0.602,158,2009-05-13,Mr. MARCHANT.," Madam Speaker, Mr. Ma  Ying-jeou was inaugurated as President of Republic of China (Taiwan) on May 20, 2008.  During the last twelve months there has been  a considerable reduction of tension across the  Taiwan Strait and there have been productive  talks between the two sides on issues such as  direct airline flights, an economic accord protecting  investments, more  tourist  visits by  mainlanders to Taiwan.  President Ma has also been working closely  with the U.S. government. The mutual relationship between our two countries is strong. We  hope that the relations will grow even stronger  in all areas, including trade, science and technology, educational exchange, military sales  and  Taiwan’s  participation  in  international  agencies.  It  is heartening  to  learn  that Taiwan has  been invited to attend this year’s World Health  Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, Switzerland from  May 19 to May 27 as an observer. This is a  breakthrough for the Taiwanese government; it  is Taiwan’s first participation in a formal U.N  activity  since 1971, when  the world body  switched its recognition to mainland China.  In celebrating President Ma’s first anniversary  in office,  I  join my Congressional colleagues in hoping that Taiwan’s participation  in the WHA this May will lead to Taiwan’s future successes  in  returning  to other  international organizations.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE VETERANS  GROUP  LIFE  INSURANCE  IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2009  HON. STEVE BUYER  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
193,,111,0.435,158,2009-05-13,Mr. BUYER.," Madam Speaker,  today  I am  introducing the Veterans’ Group Life Insurance  Improvement Act of 2009 which increases the  amount of life insurance available to veterans.  Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI) is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The purpose of this program is to give  veterans  the  option  to  convert  their  Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI)  coverage  that  they carry when  they are  in  service to a competitive life insurance product  for them and their family in post-military life.  Under current law, veterans have up to one  year to convert the amount of SGLI coverage  they  carry  to  VGLI.  Many  separating  servicemembers are young and don’t see the  need to carry a large amount of life insurance  coverage. However, as  they get older and  have a family, many of these servicemembers  have expressed a desire  to purchase additional coverage but are barred from doing so  under current law.  The Veterans’ Group Life  Insurance  Improvement Act of 2009 allows veterans to purchase up  to $400,000 of VGLI coverage  in  $50,000 increments, every five years, until the  age of 60. The costs of such increases in coverage will be offset by premiums veterans pay,  so there is no direct cost to the government.  This bill gives our veterans greater flexibility in  their  life  insurance choices and  I urge all  members to co-sponsor and support this legislation.  f  A TRIBUTE TO CONSTANCE V HAY-  ALLEYNE  HON.

194,,111,0.56,165,2009-05-13,Mrs. MYRICK.," Madam Speaker,  in 1962,  Congress passed a resolution recognizing the  week of May 15 as National Police Week.  Today, I want to thank and honor those brave  men and women who daily protect and serve  our neighborhoods, and those who have given  the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  I also want to extend a special thanks to the  Charlotte Mecklenburg  Police  Department.  This week, 20 officers from the CMPD and the  Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office embarked  on a 410-mile bike ride to Washington, DC, to  honor the memory of all officers killed in the  line of duty. These dedicated servants started  the annual ride in 2007 after CMPD Officers  Jeff Shelton and Sean Clark were killed. Not  only do these officers ride to remember their  fallen brothers and sisters, but they also raise  money for the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, which commemorates the service  and sacrifice of law enforcement officers.  We must never forget that we are kept safe  because of those who take up the charge as  law enforcement officers. This week, I join with  the 9th District of North Carolina and my colleagues  in honoring and remembering  these  brave men and women who are the truest example of American heroes.  IN HONOR OF GEORGE AND  ROSEMARY ESSEFF  IN RECOGNITION OF MR. B.S.  TURNER  HON. ELTON GALLEGLY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
195,,111,0.402,165,2009-05-13,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  honor George and Rosemary Esseff: entrepreneurs,  philanthropists, American  patriots  and world citizens.  George and Rosemary are being honored  this week by Many Mansions, a nonprofit organization  in my district  that has been providing hope, homes, and  life-enriching services to homeless and low-income citizens for  30 years. George and Rosemary are among  those who have had a strong and generous  hand in Many Mansions’ success.  I have the privilege of calling George and  Rosemary my friends.  George and Rosemary are the epitome of  the American success story. George began  his career  in 1951 as a chemist/metallurgist  for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before  striking out on his own and going on to become one of the world’s most successful titanium entrepreneurs.  Along the way, George and Rosemary have  used their wealth to help those in need also  have  the opportunity  to become successful.  One example  is $1 million  they donated  to  Many Mansions for a housing project several  years ago—only part of their legacy with Many  Mansions.  George and Rosemary are devout Catholics  and George’s brother, John, is a monsignor.  The  family  traces  their  roots  to Lebanon.  Three years ago, George, Rosemary, John  and their grandson, Andrew, traveled to Lebanon to further their humanitarian work, including donating equipment  to a hospital. Monsignor Esseff planned  to  lead a  retreat  for  nuns belonging to the Missionaries of Charity,  the order founded by Mother Teresa,  Then war broke out. It was not the first time  the Esseffs found themselves in wartime Lebanon and  it only cemented  their belief  that  their help is needed and beneficial.  One avenue  for  their philanthropy  is The  Esseff Foundation, which  they  founded  in  1979  in memory of his grandfather, George  Abdanour Esseff. The Esseff Foundation is a  non-political, non-profit organization dedicated  to relieving the sufferings of the poor both in  America and around the world.  In pursuit of that goal, the foundation funnels  its  resources  to  those  organizations  whose track records demonstrate their abilities  to assist and house the homeless, feed and  clothe the poor and provide medical care to  those in need.  George takes his politics as seriously as he  takes business and philanthropy. He spelled  out his beliefs and what it means to be a Republican and a patriotic American in an ad titled, ‘‘What I Am,’’ that ran in the Washington  Post on October 20, 2004.  Mr. Speaker, George and Rosemary Esseff  mirror the American Dream and have been instrumental  in helping others pull  themselves  up and realize  the Dream  for  themselves.  I  know my colleagues will join me in thanking  them  for being role models  for Americans—  striving for success honorably and morally and  bringing others along with you with generosity  and compassion—and in congratulating them  for their well deserved honors.

Turner.  In June of 1969, Mr. Turner started a small  car dealership based on years of experience  in the auto industry.

I would like to congratulate Mr. Turner for  reaching this important professional milestone  and recognize him for this important entrepreneurial and professional achievement.  f  WOMEN’S HEALTH INSURANCE  FAIRNESS ACT OF 2009  HON. RICHARD E. NEAL  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 13, 2009  ",2009
197,,111,-0.416,165,2009-05-13,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation that will  end practices that obstruct women from attaining affordable insurance policies on the individual market. The Women’s Health Insurance  Act of 2009 would end discrimination against  those women looking for health coverage who  either do not have access  to an employee-  sponsored plan or those who earn too much  money to qualify for Medicaid. Recent findings  from  the Kaiser  Family  Foundation  have  shown  that 5.7 million American women  in  2007 received health  insurance on  the  individual market. During  this difficult economic  climate and with unemployment rising, it is becoming much more  likely  that more women  will be looking for health coverage through individual insurance markets.  Unfortunately it is common practice in the  individual market today to charge women higher premiums than men for the identical coverage. Individual market insurers also can limit  coverage due to pregnancy or delivery methods. This is because individual market insurers have the ability to deny coverage based  on a ‘‘pre-existing condition.’’ For instance, a  woman who has had a Cesarean section in  the past can currently be charged a higher  premium, imposed a waiting period, or denied  coverage until she has been sterilized or can  no longer bear children. The vast majority of  these policies also do not provide coverage for  maternity care. These conditions exist  today  because there is no federal protection to stop  these practices on policies sold  in  the  individual market.  Due  to  the aforementioned problems,  the  Women’s Health  Insurance Fairness Act of  2009 is that much more important. This legislation will prevent  insurers  in  the  individual  market from charging women higher premiums  than men. The current practice is gender discrimination and should not be accepted in today’s  system.  This  gender  rating  harms  women by not only inflating premiums, but by  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:24 May 14, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A13MY8.019 E13MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 4 6 C P 1 D O R P n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

She was  recognized  with  the  Catholic  Education  Foundation’s  Teacher Award.  Ms. Nevitt  primarily works with  special  needs students  in  the Marlona  Ice Learning  Center. She pushes her students  to  reach  their maximum academic potential while providing the assistance the students need to be  successful in the classroom.

200,House,111,-0.396,6,2009-06-02,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today as the author of H.R. 1280. I  would like to thank the chairman and  ranking member of the Interior Committee, Mrs.  and Mr.  LAMBORN, and the committee staff for  their  assistance  in moving  forward  with this legislation.  H.R. 1280  is a straightforward bill  that would allow the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society to implement  the new Human Use/Natural Resource  Management Plan for the Great Lakes  Shipwreck Museum in Chippewa County, Michigan.  We have passed identical legislation  on suspension out of the House of Representatives in the 109th and 110th sessions of Congress before, but it was not  considered by the Senate. I am hopeful,  with the House acting early this year  in this legislative session, that the legislation we pass today will allow the  Senate ample time to consider and approve this legislation.  The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society is a nonprofit organization  dedicated to preserving the history of  shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. Since  1992, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has operated the Great  Lakes Shipwreck Museum to educate  the public about shipwrecks in the region. The museum provides exhibits on  several shipwrecks in the area, including an in-depth exhibit on the Edmund  Fitzgerald, which was lost with her entire crew of 29 men near Whitefish  Point, Michigan, on November 10, 1975.  Among the items on display is the 200-  pound bronze bell recovered from the  wreckage in 1995, as a memorial to her  lost crew.  In 2002, the Great Lakes Shipwreck  Historical Society, working with the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  the  Michigan Audubon Society, and  the  local community finalized a new management plan to improve the experience at the museum. The new management  plan, which was  signed  and  agreed upon by the interested parties,  will allow the historical society to expand the museum’s exhibits while addressing concerns about parking and  access to surrounding wildlife areas.  However, because the original land patent references the previous management plan,  legislation to amend the  patent  is necessary before  the new  management plan can be implemented.  H.R. 1280 amends the land grant patent to allow the new management plan  to be implemented. Congressman CAMP  of Michigan has joined me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I thank him  for his support.  The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has continuously improved  the experience at the museum since it  was established in 1992. With the approval of H.R. 1280, Congress will allow  the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum to  further develop this cultural and historical resource.

202,House,111,0.307,48,2009-06-02,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Well, I thank the gentleman from Missouri. Your overview of this, your reference to real science is refreshing. In  the debate and most of the debate of  the majority party here,  it’s not so  much based on real science as political  science  or  even,  to  some  degree,  science fiction. And so, to look at why  this—and I looked at every piece of legislation in terms of cost benefits. And  when we look at the benefits of this, I  think human activity,  it’s acknowledged, does contribute towards carbon  dioxide emissions. But it’s less than 4  percent. To put that into perspective,  forest fires, wildfires contribute 10 percent of CO2emissions. And so not even  with the debate of, you know, are we  warming the Earth or not warming the  Earth, there’s a lot of smart folks out  there that are publishing research or  earning their dissertations based on debating that science. But what the experts agree upon, the researchers agree  is, human activity is less than 4 percent  contributes  towards CO2 emissions.  You know, in terms of the cap-and-  trade,  cap-and-tax  that  we’re  discussing——  ",2009

205,Senate,111,-0.205,69,2009-06-02,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  rise today to express my strong support  for the confirmation of Gina McCarthy  to head the Office of Air and Radiation  at the Environmental Protection Agency. I have had the opportunity to work  with and get to know Ms. McCarthy  during her tenure as the commissioner  of Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection. Ms. McCarthy  has worked tirelessly to make Connecticut’s air, land and water cleaner,  which in turn has made Connecticut  the wonderful place it is today to live,  work and raise a family.  Among her achievements,  I would  like to highlight Ms. McCarthy’s pioneering  work  to  address  climate  change in New England. She is widely  recognized as a chief engineer of the  very  successful Regional Greenhouse  Gas Initiative. Since her appointment  in 2004, Ms. McCarthy has worked to  dramatically  improve  Connecticut’s  environment. She has restored and defended the integrity of many of Connecticut’s  most  cherished  natural  treasures. She devoted herself to protecting Long Island Sound, a source of  nourishment and recreation to the millions who  live and work along  its  coastline.  As  commissioner,  Ms.  McCarthy devised strategies for dealing with our State’s solid waste, and  she worked to improve Connecticut’s  air quality. She also made great strides  to  reinvigorate our parks and open  spaces.  Gina arrived in Connecticut with a  wealth of experience after holding a  number of health and environmental  positions in Massachusetts at the local,  State and Federal levels. She worked  for the Stoughton Board of Health and  Conservation,  Massachusetts’  Hazardous Waste Facility  Site  Safety  Council, the Massachusetts Toxics Use  Reduction Program and the New England Governor’s Environment  Committee. Ms. McCarthy also served as  the under secretary of policy at the  Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs and as the deputy  secretary of operations to the Office for  Commonwealth  Development  where  she oversaw the development and implementation of Massachusetts’  first  Climate Protection Action Plan.  We have been lucky to have Gina in  Connecticut and I am excited that the  entire country will now benefit from  her talents at the EPA. In her new position, Ms. McCarthy will be responsible for developing national programs,  technical policies and regulations to  control air pollution and prevent exposure to radiation. She will continue her  work to address climate change and  improve  energy  efficiency—a  double  charge that is both timely and imperative to the continued health of our  planet. She will also develop strategies  to reduce industrial and vehicle-generated air pollution as she works to improve indoor and outdoor air quality. I  am excited to have someone of Ms.  McCarthy’s character and credentials  leading these essential efforts and I am  filled with confidence in her ability to  address them productively.  I strongly support the nomination of  Gina McCarthy to head the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation and urge my  colleagues to do the same.  ",2009
206,Senate,111,-0.318,90,2009-06-02,Mr. WYDEN.," Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me tell the  distinguished Senator from Oklahoma  that I very much appreciate working  with him on health care legislation. We  did it in the House, and we are going to  do it again. I think this time the Senate is going to make history and have  comprehensive health  reform, and  I  look forward to working with my colleague on it.  I come here today to express my  strong support for the Family Smoking  Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.  The lead sponsor of this legislation is,  of course, Senator KENNEDY. I say ‘‘of  course’’ because the fact is, for four  decades  Senator  often  against great odds, has consistently  come back again and again to lead the  fight to improve health care for the  people of our country. Sometimes it  was for children. Sometimes it was for  seniors. Sometimes it was for the disabled. Sometimes it was for those who  have suffered mental illness. I could go  on and on, and we would be here until  breakfast  time  if  I were  to  try  to  itemize all of  the major pieces of  health reform legislation Senator KENNEDYhas authored over the last four  decades. It is very appropriate that he  is the lead sponsor of this legislation.  The fact is, after Congress passes this  important bill and takes steps to improve public health, we will be very  fortunate  that Senator KENNEDY is  going to lead the Senate once more on  comprehensive health reform. I wish to  make clear as a member of the Senate  Finance Committee  that  I am very  much looking forward to Senator KENNEDY’s involvement in this issue and  his championing of the cause of fixing  American health care. He has been the  leader on this issue for four decades.  I come to this topic with I think a  personal perspective that also affects  my role as a policymaker. In 1994, when  I was a Member of the House, I served  on the Health and Environment Subcommittee. It was chaired by HENRY  WAXMAN, a great champion of trying to  protect children against the dangers of  tobacco. Chairman WAXMAN had the  CEOs of major tobacco companies before his subcommittee. He put all of  the CEOs under oath, and as expected,  Chairman WAXMAN did a tremendous  job in terms of laying out the case for  public health. In fact, he was so effective, that by the time it came to my  turn, I was hard-pressed to find a question he hadn’t already asked the tobacco CEOs. Just as I was thinking  about packing up, I turned to some of  Chairman WAXMAN’s  staff, who  are  wonderful public servants, and I asked  whether any of the members of our  committee had asked the tobacco executives if they thought nicotine was  addictive. The staff all told me nobody  had. They said: You ought to ask them.  I wish to take a minute to lay out that  historical record of what happened.  I asked each one of the tobacco executives that day back in April of 1994  whether they thought nicotine was addictive. The president of Philip Morris  spoke first and said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive, Yes.  Then the chairman and CEO of Reynolds Tobacco Company  spoke  and  said:  Mr. Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine  clearly do not meet the classic definition of  addiction. There is no intoxication.  Then the president of U.S. Tobacco  spoke. He said:  I don’t believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.  The chairman and CEO of Lorillard  said:  I believe that nicotine is not addictive.  The chairman and CEO of the Liggett  Group said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.  The chairman and CEO of Brown &  Williamson said:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.  Finally, the president and CEO of  American Tobacco said:  I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive.  I made a vow after I had asked that  question that during the time I would  have the honor of serving in the House  and later the Senate, to make an effort  to do everything I could to hold tobacco companies and other companies  that mislead the American people accountable. Today, we are able to do  that because of the outstanding leadership of Chairman KENNEDY. He is giving us the opportunity to hold accountable the tobacco companies that mislead the public with respect to their  marketing practices and with respect  to advertising. The Kennedy legislation  is, in my view, very much needed to  protect the public health—particularly  the health of our young people—because it will give us the authority to  hold the tobacco companies accountable for their actions.  This  is also  relevant  to  the next  major health bill that we will be dealing with in the Senate which will take  the form of comprehensive health reform—health reform that ensures all  Americans have good, quality, affordable coverage and, particularly, does so  in a way that holds costs down.  I, gratefully, had a chance to meet  with the President today at the White  House. The President, who has clearly  signaled this will be a top priority for  him, has now sent the message that  history, to a great extent, is going to  judge us on our ability to hold down  runaway health costs and cut costs for  American families.  In my home State alone, $1.1 billion  in health care costs are directly attributed to smoking per year, and it costs  the Oregon Medicaid Program nearly  $287 million per year. Nationwide, $96  billion in health care costs are directly  attributed to smoking. This includes  $24.7 billion in smoking-caused Medicare expenditures.  There are enormous financial costs  specifically associated with people at  an early age getting addicted to tobacco use. Then, of course, there is the  extraordinary loss of life that comes  about as a result of tobacco. According  to the Centers for Disease Control, in  the United States, over 400,000 deaths  each year are directly attributable to  tobacco use. The FDA has given the authority to regulate food and prescription drugs, and  it  certainly makes  sense that the FDA regulates tobacco,  which is responsible for the death of  over 400,000 Americans per year.  The Senate, because of the leadership  of Senator KENNEDY, has the unique opportunity to reduce the financial and  human toll of tobacco. I wished to recount, briefly, that hearing in 1994, because ever since that time, when the  tobacco  executives  said under  oath  that nicotine wasn’t addictive, I have  wished to be part of an effort to hold  the  tobacco  companies  accountable  when they mislead the American people. As a result of the outstanding leadership of Chairman KENNEDY, it is possible  for the Senate to  finally hold  these companies accountable by passing this legislation. I hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will join  me and Chairman KENNEDY in  supporting this long overdue bill.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2009

Friday, May 29, was Marilynn’s last  day as the Congressional Aide in our office.  Marilynn has been serving the people of the Illinois Fifth Congressional District with distinction since 2007, and deserves our wholehearted thanks for her efforts.  After graduating from DePaul University in  2007, Marilynn went  to work  for my predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, beginning as an intern. After spending a few months working for  Emily’s List, Marilynn returned  to Congressman Emanuel’s office in April 2008, working in  the District Office and the Washington Office  as a Congressional Aide.  Marilynn has been extremely helpful to me  as  I’ve begun my  time  in Congress.  I have  certainly benefited  from her experience handling casework for Spanish-speaking constituents, managing the Fifth Congressional District  of Illinois office in the interim period, and assisting with travel, records and logistics for our  new office.  I would like to wish Marilynn the best of luck  in her future endeavors, whether it be teaching  English  to students  in Brazil, attending  law  school, or any other adventure.  I know  that  she will  find success  in whatever path she  chooses, and I thank her for her service to the  people of the Illinois Fifth Congressional District.  f  IN CELEBRATION OF THE ARMY  AND  AIR  FORCE  EXCHANGE  SERVICE’S  114TH ANNIVERSARY  AND DEPLOYEE APPRECIATION  WEEK, JULY 19, 2009–JULY 25, 2009  HON.

209,,111,-0.343,153,2009-06-02,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  mark a significant victory  in my district  for  open space preservation in Pennsylvania and  the United States. Yesterday, an agreement  was finalized to permanently protect 426 acres  of  the  450-acre  Erdenheim  Farm  in  Whitemarsh and Springfield Townships.  The conservation of  this property will become the centerpiece of 2,000 acres of open  space between Fairmount Park in Philadelphia  and  Fort  Washington  State  Park  in  Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania. It will also ensure  the completion of a regional trail network between Fort Washington Park and  the Morris  Arboretum  that has been envisioned since  1899.  Erdenheim Farm has been working agricultural land since the days of William Penn. It  was purchased in 1912 by George D. Widener  Jr, son of  the streetcar magnate.  In 1971,  Widener bequeathed the property to his nephew, Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. Mr. Dixon maintained the property as a working farm raising  cattle, sheep, and  thoroughbred horses until  his death in 2006.  The preservation of Erdenheim Farm  is a  remarkable example of the excellent work that  can be accomplished  through public-private  partnerships leveraging local and state funds.  There are many organizations that deserve  recognition: the descendents of the Dixon Estate  for  their willingness  to work with conservationists  to protect  the  farm; Peter and  Bonnie McCausland, for purchasing 259 acres  of the estate and placing all but 23 of those  acres  under  conservation  easements;  the  Whitemarsh Foundation led by Hugh Moulton  for its efforts to acquire 189 acres using $26  million in state and local grants, tax revenue,  and private donations; the Natural Lands Trust  led by Molly Morrison, for its expertise in putting this deal together and enforcing the easements on  the  land; and state, county, and  local officials who also deserve immense credit for their willingness to secure the necessary  funding to make this happen.  I ask that the full House of Representatives  join me in congratulating everyone that made  this historic accomplishment possible. On behalf of the residents of Philadelphia and Montgomery Counties, I acknowledge and appreciate this important work and the opportunity it  provides  for  future generations  to enjoy  this  national treasure.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF RALPH  BLANTON  HON.

211,House,111,-0.142,10,2009-06-09,Mr. TEAGUE.," Mr. Speaker, over the  Memorial Day recess, our Nation lost  two individuals that I consider to be  national treasures. Two marines that  were known as ‘‘Navajo Code Talkers’’  passed away: John Brown, Jr., of Crystal, New Mexico, and his compatriot,  Thomas Claw. Both were 87.  During World War II, the Marines recruited members of the Navajo Nation  for the specific purpose of devising a  code that was based on the Navajo language. The Japanese were never able to  break the code, and the Code Talkers  were credited with helping save lives  and contributing to the military success in the Pacific theater.  The Code Talkers’ contributions were  invaluable, and we should always be  grateful for their service. They did so  much, and their contribution can be  summarized best by what John Brown  said when he was presented with the  Congressional Gold Medal:  ‘‘We have  seen much in our lives. We have seen  war and peace, and we know the value  of the freedom and democracy that this  great Nation embodies. But our experience also reminds us how fragile these  things can be and how vigilant we must  be in protecting them.’’  f  FISCAL RESTRAINT  (Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Working people  go every day without care or struggle  to pay increasingly higher premiums  and deductibles. In my home State of  Maryland, 76.7 percent of the uninsured  are from working families.  Now,  if a single-payer plan  is not  adopted by this Congress, which I support strongly, then we must have a robust public plan option like Medicare  to be enacted to reduce costs for small  businesses  and  individuals,  provide  true competition, and give patients the  choice they deserve. A public plan option has to be available to all without  exclusions.  It must  retain  patient  choice and  implement  reforms  that  promote quality care, prevention, primary care, and chronic health care  management. And importantly, a public plan option must address health  care  disparities  in underrepresented  communities.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress and President will be judged by our ability to  construct a health care system that  covers all Americans, lowers costs for  everyone, and provides real and competitive choice  for health care. The  time for reform is now, and we can’t  delay.  f  THE CRISIS IN HEALTH CARE  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2009

These two wouldn’t  have been near North Korea were it not  for the barbaric cruelty of its regime.  Ling and Lee were convicted of so-  called ‘‘grave crimes.’’ It is the North  Korean regime that commits real grave  crimes against millions of North Koreans every day.

216,House,111,-0.408,17,2009-06-09,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  support of H. Res. 505, which condemns the  tragic murder of Dr. George Tiller. The murder  of Dr. Tiller  is a  form of domestic  terrorism  that we cannot tolerate in our country.  I firmly agree with President Obama that we  can maintain our beliefs while agreeing to disagree. Dr. Tiller’s medical practice in Kansas  was operating legally, and we must abide by  the rule of law.  Mr. Speaker, I have personal knowledge of  the work of Dr. Tiller.  In 2000, my Subcommittee Staff Director, Jason Steinbaum,  and his wife, Miriam, were expecting a child.  This was their first baby, and they were very  excited about becoming new parents.  Through visit after visit to their doctor, they  learned  the pregnancy was proceeding well  and all seemed normal. The sonograms were  all as  they should have been, until calamity  struck. At 28 weeks the doctors discovered a  horrible brain deformity. They said  the baby  would die in utero or shortly after birth.  I recall  that Jason and Miriam went  from  doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital to try  to find a way to save their baby boy, but all  told them that there was no chance that he  would live. At that point, after consulting with  their clergy, their doctors, and their families,  they decided to terminate the pregnancy to put  an end to this tragedy in their lives.  At 28 weeks, however, extremely few physicians in the country would provide the medical  care  they  needed.  Dr.  Tiller  was  recommended to them as the best physician to  help them.  I recall that I could not believe they had to  fly to Wichita, Kansas to get the medical care  they required. As a member of Congress from  New York, I have become accustomed to receiving the best health care in New York City  and could not imagine that they would have to  travel half way across the country because no  such clinic existed nearby. Nevertheless, when  they determined that there was no other place  to which they could turn, Jason, Miriam, and  their mothers  flew  to Kansas  to Women’s  Health Care Services of Wichita and Dr. Tiller.  Jason has  told me  that  the care  they received at Dr. Tiller’s clinic was extraordinary  and that the people at the clinic treated them  as well as they could imagine. The procedure  was safe and humane, and at the end, they  held  their baby boy  for a moment and said  goodbye. Today,  the baby  is buried not  far  from their home in north Virginia.  So, as the House votes on this solemn resolution, I ask that my colleagues reflect for a  moment on  the  fact  that Dr. Tiller helped  someone right here in our congressional community and  that his murderer  took someone  who was there for one of us in a time of need.  This is a terribly sad day, and I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 505.  ",2009

220,House,111,0.749,24,2009-06-09,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, on June 1 of 2009, only  about a week ago, Private William  Long, only 23 years old, was shot and  killed as he worked at the Army Navy  Career Center, which is a military recruitment center, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Private Quinton I. Ezeagwula,  age 18, was also shot in the attack that  day. Thankfully, Private Ezeagwula  survived; although our latest information is that he remains still in critical  condition.  Mr. Speaker, most persons who are  listening today are hearing about Private Long’s death for the first time.  It’s  likely  that  most  Americans  haven’t heard of his killing because  Private Long’s murder forces the issue  that the mainstream media does not  want to confront or report on, and that  is Islamic terrorism within and coming  from within the United States.  The man accused of shooting Private  Long and Private Ezeagwula was formally  known  as  Carlos  Bledsoe.  Bledsoe  converted  to  Islam  and  changed  his  name  to Abdulhakim  Mujahid Muhammad. He later traveled  to Yemen where he was there studying  under an  Islamic  scholar. Yes, Mr.  Speaker, we have millions of law-abiding Muslims in this country. Acts of  terror committed by some members of  a religion should never be used to condemn all members of that religion. At  the same time, however, we cannot be  blind to the jihadist ideology of some  Muslims of this country who believe  that they have a religious duty to murder the innocent.  The mindset of radical Islamic terrorism which today seems to find fertile ground in the soil of jihad claims  that the cause of justice is advanced by  killing  the  innocent and by killing  those who seek to protect the innocent.  This is the fundamental reality. And  when the American media and we, as a  people, refuse to call evil by its name,  it imperils us all and it dishonors all of  those, like these two soldiers who have  sacrificed and bled to protect the innocent from that evil.

221,House,111,0.252,31,2009-06-09,Mr. PLATTS.,"  I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 453, a resolution  recognizing AmeriCorps Week observed  last month on May 9 through May 16.  AmeriCorps recognizes the  individuals who have chosen to participate in  the AmeriCorps  program,  and  they  have dedicated a significant amount of  time helping others in local communities.  In  1990, President George Herbert  Walker Bush signed the National Service Act, a network of national service  programs that engage Americans in intensive service to meet the Nation’s  vital needs in education, public safety,  health, and the environment.  In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed  the National Community Service Trust  Act, which established the Corporation  for National and Community Service,  which brought the full range of domestic community service programs under  the umbrella of one central organization.  Finally, just a few months ago, President Obama signed the latest reauthorization of the Corporation for National  and Community Service, a bill that  was developed and passed in a strong  bipartisan fashion in both Chambers.  This legislation builds on the reforms  to the corporation, started by the previous administration, to ensure additional accountability in national service programs. This most recent legislation will also help smaller organizations participate in national service,  and  it will ensure  that  the unique  skills of America’s veterans are well-  utilized.  AmeriCorps offers 75,000 opportunities for adults of all ages and backgrounds to address a myriad of needs in  communities all across America, such  as tutoring and mentoring disadvantaged youth, fighting illiteracy, building affordable housing, and assisting  communities in times of natural disaster. For example, in the last 3 years,  more than 4 million service hours have  been spent helping gulf coast communities recover and rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That’s 4 million hours of service made possible by  the organizations and by the individuals who chose to participate in the  AmeriCorps programs.  This resolution recognizes one week  where we salute current and  former  AmeriCorps members for their important work. It also allows us to thank  all community partners who make it  possible  for AmeriCorps members to  serve.  I want to take this opportunity to  thank my fellow cochairs on the National Service Caucus, Representatives  MATSUI, EHLERSand PRICE, for introducing this resolution. I ask my colleagues to support it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2009
222,House,111,-0.44,45,2009-06-09,Ms. SUTTON.," Madam Speaker, at  this time it is my honor to yield 2 minutes  to  the  distinguished  chairman  emeritus and a leader in this effort as  well,  the gentleman  from Michigan,  Congressman John DINGELL.  (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2009
223,House,111,-0.448,45,2009-06-09,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in strong support of this fine, bipartisan bill, the Consumer Assistance  to Recycle and Save Act, authored by  my friend and colleague, Ms. SUTTONof  Ohio. I commend her and her bipartisan cosponsors for their work on behalf of this.  The  bill has  the  support  of  the  Obama administration, the UAW, domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and dealers.  b1615  It also will result in meaningful reductions in vehicle fleet carbon emissions and fuel consumption while providing much-needed stimulus to our  ailing automakers and economy.  I express my deep gratitude to Chairman WAXMAN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. STUPAK, as well as Representatives SUTTON, ISRAELand INSLEE, for their collaborate, collegial approach during the  negotiations on the legislation. And I  want  to  commend my  friend, Mr.  UPTON, and others of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle as well as the  entire Michigan delegation, for their  work on behalf of this.  This  legislation  cannot wait. The  longer it is put off, the more auto sales  will be depressed. And consumers who  are excited about this proposal will  continue to wait for Congress to pass  this bill before buying that new car  that we want them to have.  In view of the unprecedented turmoil  faced by the domestic automakers and  growing imperatives to address global  warming, Ms.  fleet modernization bill stands out as a really  practical mechanism  by  which  to  achieve consumer savings, reduce fuel  consumption, lower carbon dioxide and  criteria pollutant emissions, as well as  increase sales for a critical sector of  the national economy. Indeed, in countries  such  as Germany,  fleet modernization programs have been wildly  successful in all of these areas.  This is a good bill. It will help us  with the environment, and it will help  us with employment. It will see to it  that the United States moves forward  rapidly towards a full and adequate recovery from this terrible recession in  which we find ourselves.  I urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I commend its author again.  ",2009
224,House,111,0.339,45,2009-06-09,Mr. UPTON.," Madam Speaker, I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from AlaSUTTON’s  bama and a member in good standing  of the Auto Caucus, ",2009
225,House,111,0.338,45,2009-06-09,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.,"  I  rise  today to offer my reluctant support of  the Consumer Assistance to Recycle  and Save Act, also known as the Cash  for Clunkers program.  All of us have witnessed the devastation felt by our automotive sector. In  my home State of Alabama, as in many  other States, workers have lost their  jobs or had their hours cut. Many hardworking  dealers  have  simply  been  forced to close their doors.  To help protect our jobs and stimulate the automotive sector, we must  work  to  stimulate  consumer  credit  markets and  restore  consumer  confidence. That is why I recently introduced my bill, the Consumer Auto Relief Act. Unlike the bill we are considering today, my proposal would help all  sectors of the automotive industry.  In addition to offering tax credits to  working families to help purchase new  vehicles,  the  bill would  also  help  incentivize lenders to finance new vehicles. The bill would also place no limitations on eligibility to participate in  the program. Unfortunately, my bill is  not what is on the floor today. Nonetheless, despite my reservations about  H.R. 2751, I believe that passing it is  better than doing nothing, but not by  much. I offer my support for the bill  and urge its passage.  ",2009
226,House,111,-0.491,45,2009-06-09,Ms. PELOSI.," I thank the gentlelady  for yielding. I commend her for her tremendous leadership in putting together  this legislation that we have before us.  She, Representative ISRAEL and Representative  all worked  very  hard to come to a position that we can  all support today. Mr. MARKEY is here  of the Select Committee, and of course  Mr. DINGELL, the Chair Emeritus of the  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee.  Others, Mr. BRALEY, Mr. STUPAK—well,  all of our colleagues have had an important role—Mr. KILDEEand our colleagues on the Republican side of the  aisle. Hopefully we will have a good,  strong bipartisan vote today on this  legislation.  Because you all have given us an opportunity to pass legislation that is a  benefit to our economy and a benefit to  our environment, we can create and  save jobs while addressing the air pollution issue, so important to our children’s health. We will do this by allowing Americans to trade in their own  gas-guzzling  vehicles  and  receive  vouchers worth up to $4,500 to help pay  for the new, more fuel-efficient cars  and trucks.  I will go into some specifics—I know  we’ve heard it over and over again, but  this CARS bill is quite a remarkable  piece of legislation, and the timing is  perfect. And when they trade in these  cars, they will strengthen America’s  auto industry, creating jobs and reducing layoffs, and save more than 250 million gallons of gas. This has been tried  and true around the world in recent  months with great  success.  In Germany,  for example,  it boosted auto  sales by 20 percent.  Because this legislation will deliver  consumer savings, increase vehicle demand, help save American jobs while  cutting greenhouse gas emissions and  reducing our dependence on foreign oil,  it is supported by a broad coalition.  That coalition includes the Big Three  automakers, the United Auto Workers,  car dealers, business groups such as the  National Association of Manufacturers,  the Chamber of Commerce, and, in the  lead, the Obama administration.  Today, with this legislation, we will  ensure a  strong American manufacturing base. As much as anything that  we can do in terms of addressing the  issue of the auto industry in our country, this is a national security issue.  The auto industry’s success is essential  to ensuring that we have a strong manufacturing base. This legislation today  will ensure that we have a strong manufacturing base and get more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road, which is essential to our economy, to our national  security, and a clean, green future.  I commend my colleagues once again.  I commend Congresswoman SUTTON for  her determination  to accelerate  the  pace of when we would bring this legislation to the floor and urge strong bipartisan support for the bill, which it  certainly deserves.

229,House,111,-0.265,59,2009-06-09,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. LARSEN) for yielding me time, and  I also want to commend him for his  leadership on this important issue.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H. Res. 410, a resolution I introduced  with my friend from South Carolina,  the Honorable HENRY BROWN, along  with the distinguished co-Chairs of the  Congressional  Boating  Caucus,  the  Honorable GENE from Mississippi and  the Honorable CANDICE  MILLERfrom Michigan.  Our resolution highlights the important contributions of the recreational  boating community and the boating industry as to the quality of our lives  and as to our continued economic prosperity. I urge President Obama to issue  a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe July 1 as National Boating Day.  Boating is a famous symbol for south  Florida, where I come from, and for  other parts around the country. Millions of residents  in our community  and  tourists  take  to  the waters of  south Florida to boat, to fish, to dive,  to snorkel, and to view scenic tours  along our pristine coastline and along  our  unique  intercoastal  waterway.  Palm Beach County alone has over  40,000 registered boaters. Fort Lauderdale’s majestic canals have earned it  the nickname  ‘‘the Venice of America.’’  The significance of the boating community is not only symbolic. The industry is a major economic engine in  Florida, responsible for over $2.8 billion  in direct sales and for 30,000 jobs State-  wide. In my district alone, there are  over 34,000 registered boats. The industry produces $193 million, and it employs over 2,000 of my constituents.  As everyone here knows, the contributions of the boating community  extend far beyond the Sunshine State.  The boating community  includes  59  million people and 13.6 million registered boats throughout the United  States.  In addition, the recreational  boating industry provides more than  $37 billion in sales and in services to  the U.S. economy, and it provides over  300,000 jobs throughout our country.  One need only look at the geographic  diversity among members of the Congressional Boating Caucus, of which I  am a proud member, to measure the  broad  influence and contributions of  the boating  community and of  the  boating industry. Members come from  33 States, including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and West Virginia.  Clearly, boating is not just a coastal  pastime. It  is an American pastime.  Boating also brings us closer to our  natural  resources  and  treasures.  I  strongly believe that an appreciation  for environmental stewardship comes  through an  interaction with nature.  For example, it’s hard to comprehend  the beauty of our coral reefs until you  see it under water with your own eyes  through a boat. Once you do, you begin  to understand their importance and the  need to protect them for the continued  health of our oceans.  Boating gives us these cherished opportunities to commune with nature,  and it should be no surprise that boaters can be impassioned stewards of the  environment, teaching future generations of boaters to have a healthy respect and appreciation for our natural  resources.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker,  I  urge my colleagues to support H. Res.  410, and I thank the gentleman from  Washington again for bringing H. Res.  410 to the floor.  I urge its passage.  ",2009
230,House,111,0.435,59,2009-06-09,Mr. SOUDER.," I thank my friend and  colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership on Transportation and for the  time to speak on this bill.  As a member of the Boating Caucus,  since we first formed this, I am really  pleased to be supportive of this resolution. In northeast Indiana, basically, I  represent a lot of water with plants  and farms in between.  In Kosciusko County, we have 100  lakes. In Steuben County, we have 100  lakes. Along this ridge, one water system heads  towards Lake Erie; one  water  system  heads  towards Lake  Michigan, and the other goes down into  the Mississippi Valley. Because of geological potholes basically connected together, sometimes through small dams  and sometimes in natural larger lakes,  we have the bulk of the lakes in Indiana.  It  is when  the glaciers pulled  back. So in this zone, I would guess we  may have 40 to 60 percent of the natural  lakes  in the State of  Indiana.  Some have been, historically in United  States’ history, big attractions, not  necessarily as big a tourist attraction  as in Florida or as in Wisconsin or, for  that matter, as in Washington State,  but Winona Lake was a big Chautauqua  area.  In Kosciusko County, we have a number of State parks on these lakes, and  so we’re proud to bring in lots of regional tourism and people who enjoy  them. They’re sometimes lined up to  get to the open space on our lakes in  Indiana.  Yet, as the number one manufacturing district in the United States—I  can’t remember the  latest  figures—I  believe we’re  fifth  in  the manufacturing of boats. Many of those boats go  JOE down to Florida and to the coasts. The  inboard-outboard engine and the jet engine were both invented in my district,  working with Volvo in Sweden. Many  of the larger boat companies are based  there—everything from float boats to  fishing boats to high-powered speedboats. It is a critical part of our district. It has been a pleasure to work  with the boating industry as we work  on how to get retail floor plan financing for boats.  We hear a lot right now about GM  and Chrysler—the auto companies.  I  represent Elkhart County, along with  Congressman  DONNELLY. We’ve  been working to make sure of the RV  industry, 58 percent of which is there;  but if you’ll notice and look carefully  at the retail floor plan financing and at  SBA and at what they’ve done through  TALF and other things, you’ll see it  says cars, trucks, RVs, motorcycles,  and boats, because the same challenge  that we’re facing in the auto industry  is true for the boating industry, which  is how do we make sure there are adequate boats being purchased from manufacturers; how do we make sure there  is the financing to keep them afloat,  and then how do we make sure of the  dealers. If they can only get one-fourth  of their normal inventory there, here  in this peak season for selling boats, it  isn’t going to work.  So this is a very unusual time and an  important time for the boating industry. Not only are we entering the summer season in the Great Lakes region  and in other areas of the country where  boating and recreation are at a peak,  but it’s also a time of survival. It is  probably the biggest challenge to the  boat manufacturers since the  luxury  tax nearly sunk them years ago.  So I stand, honored to speak on behalf of this resolution because it’s very  important that we call to the attention  of the American people not only the  great pleasures of recreational boating  but also the importance of having our  boating industry survive.

These brave citizen soldiers,  based out of Camp Atterbury in Edinburgh, IN,  will be conducting a wide range of engineering  missions  in support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom; including searching for improvised explosive devices, building roads and bridges, and,  in general, improving lives to both our service  personnel in Iraq and Iraqi civilians.  I am confident  that  their skilled work and  dedication to duty will save lives, improve conditions in Iraq, and ultimately work toward the  completion of our country’s mission in Iraq.  I would also  like  to honor  the  families of  these Guardsmen, who without their love and  support, would make this already difficult task  that much more challenging. They too share in  the hardships of military service, and they too  deserve our utmost thanks and respect.  These brave Hoosier Guardsmen and their  families will be in my thoughts and prayers.  f  CONGRATULATING  RAMSEY  POLICE DEPARTMENT D.A.R.E. PROGRAM STUDENTS  HON.

Dater  and St. Paul  Interparochial Schools.  The  young people participating  in  this  important  program have made a commitment to say no  to drugs, underage drinking, and gang violence. They have done this with the support of  Chief of Police Bryan Gurney and the brave  men and women of  the Ramsey Police Department.  Drug  Abuse  Resistance  Education,  or  D.A.R.E., began as a small program  in Los  Angeles in 1983. Today, it is implemented in  more than 75 percent of our nation’s school  districts and  in more  than 43 other nations.  This program allows children  to defeat  the  negative cultural influences that they are challenged with daily by opening the lines of communication  between  law  enforcement  and  youth and empowering them with confidence  and courage to say no to drugs.  I am proud of the young boys and girls who  participated in this program in Ramsey, and I  would like to recognize them all for taking this  step toward positive citizenship:  Mark Andersen, Michael Babikian, Samuel  Berman, Brianna Bussiere, Olivia Carriero, Michael Cassella, Francesca De Palo, Matthew  De Pinto, Sonny Del Valle, Ross Farcas,  Fiona Flood, Melanie Greenberg, Dwight Han,  Sarah  Hattar,  Lindsay  Hoffman, Morgan  Kleinberg,  Julie McNamara,  Justin Millet,  Brandon  O’Callahan,  Courtney  Schreiber,  Ryan Scialla, Nikita Serafin, Ashley Sicard,  Jacob Simpson, Zachary Becher, Jessica Bell,  Jacob  Berkofsky,  Kaley  Bogden, Michael  Brunton, Elizabeth Burch, Michael Careccia,  Connor  Chamberlin,  Kara  Checke,  Emily  Derleth, Marc Doran, Shannon Fine, Joseph  Frohlich, Christina Goudelias, Joseph Guthrie,  Patrick Journick, Brian Lander, Elaine Les,  Enmanuel Lugo Abreu, Brandon Mazzola, Rebecca Moya, Allison Murphy, Stephen Pirro,  Kelly Richter, Alaina Sebes, Lucas Alvarez,  Rosemary Arpino, Christopher Di Palma, Katherine Donnelly, Daniel Donovan, Ryan Faulkner, Thomas Feehan, Daniel Giallombardo,  Meredith Halik, Haruna Ishii, Kevin Johns, Melissa  Lara, Devan  Larson, Maria Martino,  Jesse  Mitchell,  Megan  Murphy,  Mariana  Perez, Eric Pflugfelder, Stephen Porter, Christine Song, Austin Triglia, Kayla Vanderbilt,  Siera Vari, Alexandra Aloi, Robert Beers,  Joshua  Bialkin,  Emma  Bogaenko, Megan  Bosso, Gregory Botz, Carlie Capela, Joseph  Carroll, Nicole De Franco, Matthew Donnelly,  Bridget Gregory, JohnEric Hornyak, Ashley  Houser, Kenneth Kasprzak, Kevin Latz, Kellen  McDonald, Peter McNally, Kazuki Miyamoto,  Amanda Nedelkoff, Bridget Quinn, Victoria  Stitz, Samantha Stollman, Caitlin Sweeney,  Evan Szucs, John Alicandri, Jenna Bahnsen,  Olivia Cseh, Matthew Desimone, Conor Dobson, Olivia Gilligan, Mackenzie Juhlin, Elise  Kelly, Sean Kopczynski, Kelsey Larkin, Erin  Latz, Katherine Lenahan, Garrett Mast, Kathryn Miller, Jennifer Monteith, Patrick O’Keefe,  Jeffrey Padovano, Jacqueline Pesco, Sean  Riordan,  Jared  Schwarz,  Alexander  Sebastiano, Haydn Van Dyk, Lauren Venturini,  Kaitlyn Zwerling, Sarah Ahearn, Kayla Azouri,  Danny  Balbuena,  Tye  Baruffaldi,  Nicole  Borbone, Samuel Brickman, Gabrielle Daniels,  Kristen Foelsch, Anne Glerum, Jake Gursaly,  Josue Herrera, Siranush Hovhannisyan, Kathryn Iannuzzi, Kazel Kapadia, Brendan Mahon,  Peter  Mariani,  Robert  McOwen,  Victoria  Medlicott, David Mende, Harrison Mobbs, Jessica Pevny, Elena Polin, Henry Ruitenberg,  Ryan Shevlin, Christopher Spittler, Kimberly  Tuntigian, Brita Andersen,  Taylor Corbett,  Julia D’Antonio, Matthew Davidson, Sean  Donnelly, Sean Donohue, Timothy Finnegan,  Lillian Hong, Samantha Hotz, Harrison  Illes,  Brendan Jahnke, Khadija Khan, Lily Kramer,  Brian  Kurnentz,  Lacey  Laggan,  Thomas  Lanning,  James Messina,  John Milligan,  James O’Keefe,  James Pupalaikis, Alyssa  Rose, Breanna Russell, Elisa Silecchia, Kara  Sutcliffe, Anna Wanner, Jack August, Brooke  Bernier,  Carlo  Alberto  Bolognini,  Kelly  Carolan,  Jake  Cataldo,  Christina  Cowie,  Deanna De Luca, Brooke Dommenge, Matthew  Eng,  Jacob  Englishman,  Zachary  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:17 Jun 10, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09JN8.006 E09JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o 2 S D O O W W         ",2009

As  the 2009 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class  A girls basketball champions,  the Lady Marauders have shown the discipline and teamwork required to achieve greatness.  The Lady Marauders have a rich history of  achievement. Having won two PIAA Class A  championships  in  three  seasons, and  five  overall, the Lady Marauders are no strangers  to success. Their season’s record of 30–1 is  tied for the second most in a single season in  Lady Marauder program history.  This year’s season came  to a close on  March 21st at University Park, PA, and resulted in a 49–27 defeat of Nativity BMV by  Bishop Guilfoyle’s Lady Marauders. The hard  work and  talent of  the nineteen players, as  well as their five coaches, most certainly led to  this rewarding experience.  These young women are exemplary athletes  and their pride in their performance is an inspiration to all of Blair County. I believe that  this championship will be one of many successes in the lives of these talented players  and coaches, and I congratulate them for all  their efforts.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR. ISAIAH R.

255,,111,-0.465,192,2009-06-09,Mr. CLYBURN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to an outstanding constituent and an award-winning educator, Dr.  Isaiah R. McGee. Dr. McGee is a 2009 recipient of  the South Carolina  Independent Colleges  and Universities  Inc. Excellence  in  Teaching Award. He is the director of choral  studies and assistant professor of music at  Claflin University. He also directs the Claflin  University Concert Choir.  Dr. McGee  is a native South Carolinian,  having been born and raised in Anderson. He  is a graduate of my alma mater, South Carolina State University, and earned his masters  from  the University of South Carolina. Dr.  McGee earned his doctorate  from Florida  State University  in Music Education—Choral  Conducting, and served as a graduate assistant and director of the Gospel Choir at Florida  State.  During his career, Dr. McGee has earned a  reputation as an accomplished vocalist, conductor, adjudicator, and clinician. He has international experience, debuting as the Conte in  Cimarosa’s  II Convito at Teatro Signorelli  in  Cortona, Italy. He stays very active in professional organizations  including  the American  Choral Directors Association and MENC.  Dr. McGee joined the Claflin University faculty in 1997, and has made an enviable mark  on the Orangeburg campus. Dr. McGee is always  looking  for ways  to enrich  the experiences of his students  to promote  their performance and their commitment to their craft.  Last year, he took Claflin’s Concert Choir to  China to participate in the pre-Olympic ceremonies. They performed in both Beijing and  Shanghai.  Dr. McGee has developed a great deal of  respect  from his  colleagues and  students.  Claflin University’s president Dr. Henry Tisdale  calls him ‘‘an exemplary member of our faculty  and  committed  to  teaching  and  service.’’  Claflin’s vice president for academic affairs Dr.  George Miller says, ‘‘Dr. McGee’s approach to  teaching and scholarship with his student partners demonstrates the strength of the amalgam that results when theory and practice are  combined.’’  Dr. McGee was selected for the Excellence  in Teaching Award by his peers at Claflin University. The purpose of the award is to honor  faculty members who demonstrate the highest  standards of teaching that encourage students  to strive for excellence in their studies and intellectual pursuits. In addition to the recognition, Dr. McGee receives a $3,000 grant to be  used for professional development opportunities.  Madam Speaker, I invite you and my colleagues to join me today in applauding the tremendous  accomplishments  of  Dr.  Isaiah  McGee. He is an extraordinary example of an  educator who inspires intellectual curiosity and  demands outside enrichment  to ensure his  students reach their full potential. This award  is well deserved and is recognition of a job  well done.  f  SAMUEL MARKOFF  HON. ED PERLMUTTER  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 9, 2009  ",2009

Robertson will retire  at the end of this month after proudly  serving in the Arkansas State Police  for 32 years, providing protection and  assistance  to Arkansans  across  the  State.  Captain Robertson’s record of accomplishment  spans  three  decades. He  began his law enforcement career in  1973 as Star City, AR, chief of police  before he was commissioned on January 17, 1977, as a state trooper assigned  to the highway patrol division, troop E  headquartered in Dumas, AR. Robertson distinguished himself in the line of  duty and worked his way up the promotion ladder quickly from the rank of  sergeant, to lieutenant, and finally, in  1999, to the rank of captain, highway  patrol commander, troop F, the largest  geographical troop in the State covering nine counties in southeast Arkansas.  Under Captain Robertson’s leadership  as troop F commander, his troopers  consistently led the State in DWI arrests and other activities despite having fewer personnel than most other  troops. His dedication to keeping his  fellow Arkansans safe extended beyond  the highway patrol division. During his  30 years of service, he led the Arkansas  motor  vehicle  inspection  team  and  served as a sniper and later commander  of troop E special response team.  Captain Robertson retires from the  Arkansas State Police on June 30, 2009.  His commitment to excellence sets an  example for not only his fellow law enforcement officers, for whom he is a  mentor and friend, but also for those in  the civilian community he worked diligently to protect. Although he will be  missed in the line of duty, I wish him  continued  success  in his  retirement  and thank him for his service to our  great State of Arkansas.∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF  MCLAUGHLIN, SOUTH DAKOTA  ∑",2009

Clarke and the members of Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy on their new sanctuary. Bishop Clarke  led his congregation  in  celebrating  the achievement of  this beloved  church, which has become a citadel of faith in  the Miami-Dade County community.  In 1922, Miami Ridgeway Church of God of  Prophecy began in a small community called  Nazarene in the Northeast area of Miami, Florida. Their first pastor was the late Evangelist  Andrew Bullard. He was then succeeded by  the late Bishop J.R. Smith who served as pastor until 1930. During the mid-1930s, Brother  Ed Rolle served as pastor until the late Bishop  J.R. Smith  returned and served again until  1939. Other pastors throughout the history of  Miami Ridgeway Church of God of Prophecy  include: the late Brother Hermis Ferguson, late  Bishop Henry Curtis,  late Bishop Theophilus  Hunter, late Bishop J.D. Williams, Bishop R.B.  Davis, and Bishop George H. Knowles.  In 1983, Bishop Eustace S. Clarke,  the  present pastor, joined the Church’s family. A  Jamaican native, Bishop Clarke came to the  United States as a migrant worker  for  the  Belle Glade, Florida Sugar Cane Corporation.  Bishop Clarke married his wife, Mrs. Emily  Clarke on March 25, 1962. After nearly 47  years of marital bliss, Bishop Clarke and his  wife are blessed with 14 children. Bishop  Clarke has remained the pastor for the past  26 years.  While serving at Miami Ridgeway Church of  God of Prophecy,  in 1999 Bishop Clarke  began to follow through with his vision for a  larger sanctuary. Groundbreaking for this endeavor began  in 2000. Though  there were  many obstacles and unforeseen delays,  the  Church will  now  dedicate  their  completed  ‘‘House for God’’ on June 28, 2009.  Madam Speaker, please join me in applauding and  congratulating Bishop Eustace S.  Clarke and the members of Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy on their new sanctuary. Miami Ridgeway Church of God of  Prophecy has been dedicated  to providing  spirituality,  service  and  guidance  to  the  Church and greater community of South Florida.  It  is my hope  that Miami Ridgeway  Church of God of Prophecy continues to stand  as a beacon of resolve, inspiration and worship for many years to come.  f  COMMERCE,  JUSTICE,  SCIENCE,  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009  SPEECHOF  HON.

Res. 476  Whereas in 1979, the month of June was  proclaimed  ‘‘Black Music Month’’ and all  people in the United States were encouraged  to learn more about the important role that  African-American  artists have  played  in  shaping history and culture;  Whereas America’s rich heritage is influenced by the diversity of its people and the  important contributions of Black culture;  Whereas America’s cultural story is heavily influenced by the celebration and struggle of Black people through their musical expression;  Whereas many genres of music, such as  gospel, jazz, blues, rock and roll, rhythm and  blues, and soul that were an integral part of  American culture, trace their roots back to  the banks of the Mississippi River in cities  like Memphis, St. Louis, New Orleans, and  other cities like Kansas City and Chicago;  Whereas the amount of musical talent and  skill that came from the Mississippi Delta  and the myriad of towns in this region is undeniable;  Whereas these genres of music illustrate  the complexities of the African-American experience and they give a voice to many social movements and inspiration to countless  generations of people in the United States;  Whereas as early as the 1860s, the ragtime  artist Scott Joplin broadened the operatic  and classical worlds and Black  traveling  brass bands trekked to Beale Street in Memphis, ‘‘Home of the Blues and Birthplace of  Rock and Roll’’, to perform;  Whereas gospel music and its artists like  Thomas Dorsey, Lucy Campbell, Dr. Herbert  Brewster, Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Shirley Caesar, and Kirk Franklin are a  special part of the American tradition that  spawned future musical genres;  Whereas  the mid-20th Century  saw  the  emergence of groundbreaking jazz and blues  artists such as W.C. Handy, Bessie Smith,  Lena Horne, Charlie Parker, Lionel Hampton, Max Roach, Billie Holiday, Count Basie,  Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis,  Etta James, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus,  Thelonious Monk, Wynton Marsalis, Louis  Armstrong,  Professor  Longhair,  James  Booker, the Neville Brothers, Muddy Waters,  Albert King and B.B.

I chair the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee of Judiciary, and next week  we’re going to have a hearing on bankruptcies and health care. Health care is  the major cause of bankruptcies in this  country, and Elizabeth Edwards will be  one of our witnesses.  But when people go bankrupt because  of high medical bills, then other folks  lose out because they don’t get paid either. Merchants don’t get paid because  of that bankruptcy. So that’s another  cost of not having this health care system, and I want to thank each of you.  ",2009

You have the choice, you’ve got the  coverage, and you’ve got  the  costs  coming down. That’s exactly what this  bill aims to do.  ",2009
289,House,111,0.516,59,2009-07-14,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," What we’re really  seeing here is a continued erosion of  the rights of individuals and the rights  of States. Michigan is a donor State in  terms of  transportation. What does  that mean? It means, since the inception of the national highway or the national gas tax, for every dollar that  Michigan  has  sent  to Washington,  we’ve  received  83  cents back. That  hardly  seems  fair  to me, especially  when we’re now number one in unemployment. Think of it. When we get  that money back, the Federal Government tells us how to spend  it. The  same thing happened with education.  We sent money here.  Think about what’s going to happen  with health care. It’s going to come  here to Washington, and we’re going to  apportion it back to the States. Some  States are going to do better than others, and it’s not going to be based on  population or those types of things. It’s  going to be based on the power of the  people  in  this Chamber and  in  the  Chamber down the hall as to who has  got the most influence. There are going  to  be  donor States  and—what  are  they?—donees or beneficiaries, the ones  who get more than the rest of us.  ",2009
290,Senate,111,0.423,101,2009-07-14,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," The Washington  Post article is unique in some ways. I  guess it may be SOP for articles that  are somewhat vicious and where they  contain as many errors as  the Air  Force has pointed out with the facts  supporting the errors that were made;  that is, the July 10 Washington Post  article  was  based  upon  unnamed  sources. It was based upon a couple of  folks who said they were fired either by  the contractor or by the Air Force. We  take that for what it is worth.  One of the complaints cited in that  article was the  fact that there are  problems with the skin on the F–22.  Let me back up a minute and talk  about the sophistication of this airplane. There  is a problem with the  skin. That has been a problem. What  we have to remember is that we have  never had an airplane that could fly  with the capability that this airplane  has, that could fly completely undetected, completely through any radar  system of the most sophisticated nature of any potential adversary in the  world. The reason this airplane can do  that is because it is made of substance  and material that is unique and different to this airplane, including the  skin on the airplane. Are we going to  have problems with something that is  that unique and has never been used  before on any tactical air fighter? You  bet we are.  The position of the folks who are in  support of this amendment is that we  ought to stop production of the F–22  and buy the F–35 at a faster rate. Even  if we do that, if we have F–35s flying  tomorrow, they are going to have exactly the same maintenance issues as  the F–22. The F–22 is the model upon  which  the Joint Strike Fighter  is  based. So let’s don’t kid ourselves. We  are not taking an airplane that costs X  and substituting it with an airplane  that costs half or three-quarters of X.  That is not going to be the case. Mistakes have been made—surely—but it  is the first time we have ever had a  weapons system like the F–22 manufactured by anybody in the world. From  the mistakes we have learned. We are  going to have a better F–35. But that  F–35 is going to have the same skin  problem. It is going to have the same  weight problem the F–22 had, the F–15  had, the F–16 had, and probably every  airplane we have ever developed. It is  going to have the same maintenance  issues we are having with the F–22  today.  Although the article was wrong in  one major area with respect to maintenance,  the article  says  the maintenance of the airplane was having a success rate of 55 percent. That is wrong.  As the Air Force points out, between  2004 and today, the successful maintenance rate on those airplanes has gone  from 64 to 69 percent.  The future of TACAIR for the United  States likely does reside in the F–35  and not with the F–22. Even if we keep  buying F–22s, it will never match the  number of F–35s we will eventually  buy. Everyone hopes, as I do, that the  F–35 succeeds. But as the chair and the  ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee  themselves  have  stated,  there is a good deal of risk in the F–35  program, and there is additional risk in  what we need to put in place today  when it comes to the lives of our men  and women who are fighting our conflicts and who are  flying these airplanes.  The history of Defense programs, and  aviation programs  in particular, has  been remarkably consistent, particularly when it comes to building programs that represent a leap in technology. They cost more. They take  longer. They have more problems than  we expect. GAO has criticized the F–35  approach, and they, as well as the leadership of our committee, have stated  that not performing sufficient development testing before we proceed to procurement is one of the primary drivers  for cost increases and schedule delays  in major programs. That  is exactly  what is being proposed with respect to  the F–35.  I am a supporter of the F–35. We are  going to build far more of them than  we are F–22s. But I am not the only observer to state that we should think  twice about staking the future of our  TACAIR fleet on a program that has  only five test aircraft flying today.  I wish to talk briefly about the offsets included in our amendment which  are in the mark used to fund the purchase of these additional seven F–22s.  Senator LEVIN talked about the offset  at length. I would like to respond to  some of his comments. Most  importantly, there is absolutely nothing in  the offset we used and nothing that has  not been used by the Senate Armed  Services Committee or the chairman  himself in previous bills.  Just  last year, Senator LEVIN reduced military personnel  funding by  $1.1 billion, which is significantly more  than what my amendment reduced it  by. For the MILPERS and O&M reductions in my amendment and the markup, in each case the amendment takes  either less or approximately the same  amount as the House Armed Services  Committee bill did for this year. In  every case, the amendment takes less  than the GAO reported average under-  execution/unobligated  balances  in  those accounts. This includes the cuts  the Senate Armed Services Committee  already took in their mark.  The SASC bill itself notes that GAO  estimates that DOD has $1.2 billion in  unobligated O&M balances and  $588  million  under-execution  in  the Air  Force civ pay accounts. This is from  actual language in the Senate report.  In the civilian personnel area, the  GAO reports conclude that more funding is available than what my amendment takes. The GAO report takes into  account the expansion of acquisition  personnel who will be hired this year.  Regarding MILPERS, GAO analysis  suggests that there is on average $1 billion available. My amendment leaves a  balance of $200 million in that account.  The chairman also commented on the  provision in my amendment that assumes savings based on acquisition reform legislation authored by Senators  LEVINand MCCAIN. Let me say that my  inspiration  for this particular offset  was Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN.  I  thought they did a great job with that  bill. I hope we can continue to improve  it because it is an area where we have  to work  harder  to  avoid wasteful  spending.  The chairman included a nearly identical provision as mine  in S.  1416,  which was the Senate version of the  fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization  bill. That bill assumed a savings of $1.6  billion  based  on  acquisition  reform  bills and the SASC bill for that year.  However, unlike my provision, which  assumes savings already in law because  of passage of the Levin-McCain bill,  savings assumed by the chairman were  based on provisions that were not yet  enacted and, based on the conference  process, may never have been enacted.  Based on inflation and large increases  in the DOD budget since then, that is  probably the equivalent of $2 to $2.5  billion today. In any case, this is a tremendous amount of savings, and my  amendment would assume far less. The  offset is based upon predicted savings  in the fiscal year 2010 budget based on  recently passed acquisition reform legislation such as the Weapons System  Acquisition Reform Act, Public Law  111–23, also the business process reengineering  provision  in  the SASC  mark  and  other management  efficiencies and business process reforms.  Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN and  President Obama are correct. Savings  from this acquisition reform measure  could greatly exceed that number, because in their press conference after  the successful passage of that bill, they  all three talked about the tremendous  savings. I agree with them. That  is  going to happen. That is what we used  as part of our offset.  I want to end where I started, by  agreeing  with  John  Hamre.  John  Hamre says:  Congress can and should legitimately question spending priorities.  Not only is it appropriate but necessary for  the Congress to pass final judgment on this  question.  Secretary Gates has  rendered his  judgment. . . .But it is the duty and obligation of  members of Congress to question his recommendations [and his analysis].  There is absolutely nothing unique or  in the least bit wrong about what we  are doing. Not to do so would be to abdicate the role with which the Constitution and the American people have  entrusted us. If President Obama believes the additional funding for these  F–22s warrants a veto  threat,  even  though  that  funding  addresses  an  unmet military requirement, then that  is his decision. Our job in Congress, as  John Hamre has indicated, is to look at  the facts, weigh the risks, and render  the  judgment. That  is our role—our  independent role—in the process, and  we should accept it and use our best  judgment to decide what is right for  the Nation.

292,,111,-0.514,150,2009-07-14,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, today I rise  to recognize and thank Patrol Borough Commander, Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz of the  New York City Police Department who for the  last 15 years and a  total of 24 years has  served my Congressional District with much  CPR—Courtesy,  Professionalism,  and  Respect.  The history of American law enforcement is  a  tale of  triumphs and  tragedies. Since  the  first night watch established in Boston in 1631,  police officers,  the men and women  in blue  who serve and protect our citizenry, have laid  their lives down while serving the public interest. Never having worked in law enforcement,  I can see that police work is often dangerous,  with long hours, impossible weather, and for  not a whole lot of pay, frequently dealing with  the worst elements of our society. It has always been my considered opinion  that all  Americans owe a debt of generosity  to our  honest and hardworking police officers and the  chiefs they serve under for all that they do.  As a  thirty-nine year veteran of  the New  York Police Department, Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz embodies the true spirit of ‘‘New  York’s Finest.’’ He has served and protected  my District with great distinction and his tireless dedication  to Upper Manhattan and his  fellow officers under his command is quite admirable. Assistant Chief Diaz’s life long dedication of service  in  the  line of duty should  serve as an example to all.  Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz was appointed to the New York City Police Department in January 1970 and began his career  on patrol in Manhattan’s 1st Precinct. In January 1972, he was reassigned to East Harlem’s  25th Precinct where he served for nine years.  After a number of assignments  in Brooklyn  and Staten Island and promotions to the rank  of Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Captain, in May  1994 he was assigned back  to my beloved  East Harlem as  the Commanding Officer of  the School Safety Division.  Upon Chief Nicholas Estavillo’s historic ascension as the City of New York’s first Latino  Chief of Patrol in June of 2001, Diaz was selected to replace him as the Commanding Officer of Patrol Borough Manhattan North which  encompasses my entire Congressional District. As the Commanding Officer of Manhattan  North, Assistant Chief Diaz supervised over  2,400 police officers and over 200 civilians in  the 12 Manhattan precincts north of 59th  Street.  Assistant Chief Diaz is ‘‘True Blue;’’ one of  the finest products of my district who came up  through the struggles of life. He was born in  East Harlem’s Metropolitan Hospital to immigrant parents. His father Amador immigrated  from Chile and his mother Helena  from  the  Ukraine. Due  to a  family  illness, Assistant  Chief Diaz and his younger brother Jay were  separated from their parents and raised in foster homes through the Catholic Home Bureau.  Upon graduation from his school, Assistant  Chief Diaz  joined  the United States Marine  Corps where he so valiantly served as Corporal in the Vietnam War. As a result, he was  the recipient of two Purple Hearts. After joining  the Police Department, he attended college  night classes and obtained a Bachelor of Arts  Degree in Sociology. Assistant Chief Diaz is  also a devout family man. He has been married to his wife Lynn for thirty-seven years and  is a proud parent of a son, Carlos.  As he is re-assigned to the coveted Manhattan Borough South Command, I congratulate  Assistant Chief Diaz on his advancement, and  I’m certain that he will continue to serve the  communities of  the new command with  the  same leadership, professionalism, and admiration of those he so valiantly served in my district.  So Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my  distinguished colleagues  join me  in  recognizing my good  friend Assistant Chief Raymond Diaz for all his contributions to my district and the city of New York. He is truly one  of New York’s finest and I wish him well.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. ROSCOE G. BARTLETT  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 14, 2009  ",2009

For  the past 25  years, the International Affairs Office has done  a superb  job of developing wildlife management and  conservation efforts  to maintain  global species diversity.  While  the Congress has already created  Multinational Species Conservation Funds  to  assist highly imperiled African and Asian elephants, Rhinoceros and Tigers, Great Apes  and Marine Turtles, the Wildlife Without Borders program has provided a funding lifeline to  a number of endangered  species  that  for  whatever reason have not merited their own  Multinational Species Conservation Fund.  The first conservation grants issued under  this program were awarded  to  the Wildlife  Without Borders Program  for Latin America  and the Caribbean Initiative. Since that time,  additional  grants  have  been  allocated  for  projects in Africa, Mexico, India, China and the  Russian Federation.  In  fact,  in  the past  two  decades, the International Affairs Office within  the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has approved 955 conservation projects at a cost of  $20.5 million in taxpayer money. These funds  have been matched by more than $60 million  in private non-federal money, which is a remarkable 3 to 1 matching ratio.

297,,111,0.54,164,2009-07-14,Mr. OLSON.," Madam Speaker,  to provide  open disclosure pursuant to Republican standards on congressionally-directed funding, I am  submitting the following information regarding  funding that I support included in H.R. 3183,  the Energy and Water Appropriations Act,  2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman PETE  OLSON  Bill Number: H.R. 3183,  the Energy and  Water Appropriations Act, 2010  Account: O&M, Corps of Engineers  Name of Recipient: Port of Houston Authority  Address of Recipient: P.O. Box 2562, Houston, TX 77252  Description  of Request:  $15,603,000  in  funding would be used  for operations and  maintenance of the Port of Houston. The Port  is the 7th largest container port in the United  States and serves 50 million consumers within  a 500-mile radius. In 2007, the Port of Houston provided $285 billion in economic value,  $72 billion in personal income, and $16.2 billion in Federal Taxes. It is also home to the  second largest petrochemical complex in the  world and  the  largest refinery  in  the United  States.  Requesting Member: Congressman PETE  OLSON  Bill Number: H.R. 3183,  the Energy and  Water Appropriations Act, 2010  Account: Construction, Corps of Engineers  Recipient: Harris County Flood Control District  Address of Recipient: 9900 Northwest Freeway, Suite 220, Houston, TX 77092  Description: $2,500,000  in  funding  for  the  Clear Creek Flood Control Project. The project  on Clear Creek consists of 15.1 miles of channel rectification and a 500 acre-foot in-line detention from Dixie Farm Road to State Highway 288 and a 1,750 acre-foot detention  basin. This project will provide  lower  flood  risks to areas in the 22nd District of Texas. It  is estimated the number of homes subject to  the 1%  (100 year)  flood would be  reduced  from 3,380 to 1,130. Flood Risk Management  is in the national interest by reducing loss of  E N I L N O C E R G N O C life, injury and property destruction and reducing the flooding risks to Harris, Galveston, and  Brazoria Counties.  Requesting Member: Congressman PETE  OLSON  Bill Number: H.R. 3183,  the Energy and  Water Appropriations Act, 2010  Account: Construction, Corps of Engineers  Name of Recipient: Port of Houston Authority  Address of Recipient: P.O. Box 2562, Houston, TX 77252  Description of Request: $500,000 for additional construction by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. In order to keep the Port of Houston operating at  full capacity,  the Houston  Ship Channel must be maintained. The  increased natural shoaling has placed greater  pressure on the Port’s capacity to store and  manage dredge material and without increasing capacity they will not be able to dredge the  channel. Without  this  necessary  funding,  dredged material capacity will be unavailable  and material will be pumped longer distances  increasing the cost of dredging for the same  volume of material dredged the previous year.  This request is for additional construction.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON. ADAM H. PUTNAM  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 14, 2009  ",2009

301,House,111,0.449,43,2009-07-24,Mr. TIAHRT.," I thank the chairman.  It’s a pleasure to be here with you this  morning as we continue to consider the  fiscal year 2010 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill.  First, I’m frustrated by my role here  today. Instead of being able to perform  my duties as a ranking member as I’ve  done in the past, my role requires that  I protest the way debate is suppressed  on this bill. It is necessary, but not  something that I relish.  Usually the role of the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee,  as well as the authorizing committees,  is to present the views of the minority  and  to work with  the majority  in  crafting a bill that combines the best  ideas of both sides of the aisle. We do  this through the amendment process.  As the ranking member, I have not always agreed with what my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have proposed, but I always defended their right  to offer their amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank  Chairman OBEY for reaching out to me  during the drafting of this bill. He is a  passionate advocate for many of the  programs funded in this bill, and he has  clearly put a great deal of thought into  this bill before us. I also want to credit  him for trying to put together a bill  that Members could support by including many national priorities; yet, due  to the wholly unsustainable allocation  on top of an already unsustainable allocation in the stimulus bill for these  agencies, we could not agree on the  final product.  I also want to thank the staff for  their dedication to this important bill,  on the majority side, Cheryl Smith,  Susan Quantius, Nicole Kunko, Stephen  Steigleder, Albert Lee, Mike  Gentilly, Amy Battaglia and Devon  Klein; on my side, Stephanie Myers,  Steve  Crane,  of  course AmyClaire  Brusch from my personal office staff.  One of the most important duties of  this House, as directed by article I, section 9 of the Constitution, is to determine the financial obligations of the  Federal Government, the power of the  purse, as we say. This is, indeed, what  we are here to do today, with the  Labor-HHS-Education  Appropriations  bill. Yet instead of being able to have a  healthy discussion, as the Founders intended with this representative body,  Members, both Republican and Democrat, I note, are shut out of the process  and only permitted to speak for a short  time without the ability to offer alternatives.  Several of my colleagues and I submitted amendments to the Rules Committee for consideration on the floor  today.  I think they are substantive  amendments that deal with the public  policy issues our constituents sent us  here to debate. Even though they met  the requirements for consideration on  an appropriations act, the Democrat  leadership decided to report a gag rule  that severely limits our ability to offer  them.  When we first started down this road  to ruin with respect to the autocratic  rules that govern debates on appropriations bills, we were told that these  rules were  required because Republicans were  ‘‘filibustering by amendment’’ and because we would not commit to time limits. We knew at the  time that those arguments were mere  fig leaves, and over the past few weeks,  the evidence has become crystal clear.  We were told that we had to finish  our work quickly, so time agreements  were essential. Next, we were told that  we had done nothing  to  limit our  amendments. Strangely, when we were  in the majority, we didn’t limit amendments to appropriations bills. Why? Because we believed then, as we do now,  that Members have not only the right,  but the constitutional responsibility,  to represent their constituents.  Even so, while we were stating our  continued concern about the restrictive rules by which we have been forced  to abide for this bill, we reached out in  good faith. Instead of offering upwards  towards 50 amendments, House Republicans,  in  good  faith,  limited  the  amendments request. This year, there  were fewer Republican amendments offered on this very substantial bill than  were offered under an open rule just a  few years ago.  Republicans  offered  12—only  12—  amendments. Did some of those amendments pose potentially difficult votes  for Democrats? I guess so.  We  had  an  amendment  by Mr.  CARTERand Mr. BURTON, which would  have been in order under an open rule,  to prohibit the Democrats from killing  the largest student loan program in operation today. Is it permitted to be offered today? No.  We had an amendment by Mr. LEWIS,  the ranking Republican of the Appropriations Committee, again  in order  under the standing rules of the House if  we were operating under the procedures that allowed the American people  full  representation. The amendment would have prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services  from starting a government-run health  insurance plan. The amendment was  ruled by the Parliamentarians to be  permissible under the standing House  rules. Is Mr. LEWISgoing to offer his  amendment today? No. Why not? The  Democrats don’t want to vote on socialized medicine,  probably  because  their leadership and their constituents  don’t agree how they should vote.  As ranking Republican on this subcommittee, I had an amendment that  would have done nothing other than  codify  the nonbinding  language  the  majority  included  in  the  so-called  stimulus bill with  respect  to using  comparative effectiveness research as  an excuse to ration health care. Was I  permitted to offer it? No.  As I travel through the State of Kansas and talk to the people who sent me  here, it is clear that most Kansans, and  I think most Americans, are wondering  if this Congress and this administration understand the  long-term ramifications of the massive spending spree  we’ve been on since January. The stimulus bill we passed spent nearly $800  billion, money we don’t have. When  you add the interest that we’ll have to  pay to the Chinese who buy our debt,  the cost is going to exceed $1 trillion.  And what do we have to show for that  exercise? Unemployment has hit  9.5  percent nationwide and is expected to  rise above 10 percent. Some States are  already well over 10 percent unemployment. If this is recovery, then it is a  ‘‘jobless recovery.’’ Well, who does that  help?  We have massive amounts of money  spent on programs, many funded by the  agencies in this bill that are maybe  good in the long term but have absolutely nothing to do with bringing this  country out of  the economic crisis  we’re facing today. What it did do is  create a mountain of spending that will  hit next year and create the cliff effect.  At the time, the President and the  Democrats  in  the majority  claimed  this was one-time spending that would  drop off after 2011. I’d like to believe  that’s true, because if it isn’t, this bill  will cost about $220 billion, or $60 billion above where we are today, which is  about a 40 percent increase.  I suppose that would be okay if we  had an extra $60 billion laying around  in the Treasury, although I’d prefer to  give it back to those who worked so  hard to earn it. But the fact is, we do  not have this money. It is borrowed. It  is borrowed from the American people.  It is borrowed from their future earnings, and it is borrowed from foreign  governments like China.  Next week we will  consider  the  health reform bill that looks like it’s  going to cost well over $1 trillion, and  it is full of provisions that instruct the  Congressional Budget Office to overlook the spending.  We had a budget submitted to us by  the White House this year that, for the  first time, exceeded $3.5 billion in total  spending. The White House is apparently  so worried about  letting  the  American people know how much of  their money is being spent that they  have delayed the traditional midyear  budget review, which  is expected to  show a historic deficit.  It’s delayed  until next month when Congress has  left Washington and while many Americans are on vacation—well, those that  can afford it this year, anyway.  I want to make clear to the American people what exactly we are voting  on here today. It’s $163 billion in discretionary allocation and an $11 billion  increase from fiscal year 2009, but that  is about a 7 percent increase. But the  true cost to the American taxpayer has  to include the $126 billion that was allocated for those agencies in the stimulus act. So, in reality, these agencies  have grown by $135.3 billion, or a 93  percent increase over 2 years, 93 percent.  My colleagues and I were prepared, as  is historically done in this body, to  offer amendments to hold the spending  to levels we can afford, even move from  VerDate Nov 24 2008  02:58 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H24JY9.REC H24JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
302,House,111,0.316,50,2009-07-24,Mr. EHLERS.," I rise in support of funding for  the U.S. Department of Education’s Math and  Science Partnerships program. The legislation  we are considering  today appropriates $179  million  for Math and Science Partnerships—  equal to the current funding level.  The Math and Science Partnerships program  is an  innovative, proven program designed to improve teacher content knowledge  and teaching skills in math and science subjects. Through formula grants to every state,  the program provides crucial teacher professional  development  and  teacher  in-service  training by linking school districts with university mathematics, science and engineering departments. As  a  result  of  the Math  and  Science Partnerships program, our students’  math and science skills are strengthened.  This week, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11’s mission and astronauts  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the  Moon. This event, and  the earlier  launch of  Sputnik,  sparked  remarkable  interest  in  science education, and led to the creation of  many  valuable  federal education programs  over the next several decades. One such program,  the Eisenhower Professional Development Act, was originally enacted  in 1985  to  provide funding for professional development  opportunities for math and science educators.  In fact, before the No Child Left Behind Act  (NCLB), Congress provided substantially more  funding for math and science teacher professional development  through  the Eisenhower  program. In short, in spite of our great national  need for more well-trained scientists and engineers, we are providing  less  than half as  much funding for training science teachers as  we did before NCLB was passed  into  law.  Currently, many science teachers report little,  if any, funds available for professional development activities.  Earlier this year, Representative HOLTand I  led the charge to provide at least $450 million  in funding for the Math and Science Partnerships program. Twenty-three Members of Congress  joined us  in sending a  letter  to  the  Labor, Health & Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee requesting this important  funding.  I am disappointed  that  the bill before us  today provides  level  funding  for  the Math &  Science Partnerships program. However, I am  deeply grateful to Chairman OBEY for his willingness  to  include $5 million  in additional  funding for the Math & Science Partnerships  program in his manager’s amendment. I sincerely thank him for recognizing the need for  increased  funding  for  the Math and Science  Partnerships program. I also thank Representative HOLT for his continued dedication to supporting this program and for his work in securing this additional funding.  ",2009

306,House,111,0.518,85,2009-07-24,Mr. CANTOR.," I thank the gentleman.  I  think  the  gentleman,  though,  speaks to the point I’m trying to make.  We are trying to get things right here,  and  spending billions of dollars  for  spending’s sake is not the goal here,  and I know he agrees with me on that,  that we are trying to effect the most  prudent expenditure of taxpayer dollars in these very difficult economic  times.  As the gentleman knows, we voted on  a PAYGO bill this week, and frankly,  the spirit behind that PAYGO bill was  to attempt  to  restrain  the  type of  spending that we’ve seen this Congress  conduct. In fact, this week, in one of  the reports, one of the authors of an  opinion column said, frankly, we are  spending—the  spending PAYGO  bill  that was passed this week was full of  loopholes.  And again, we know that the PAYGO  bill that was passed was that. It wasn’t  a holistic PAYGO bill. It wasn’t something that, frankly, will do much to address the runaway spending. So we still  sit here, Mr. Speaker, and want to have  an open process so we can contribute to  holding back the runaway spending in  this town.  So I would say to the gentleman, just  as he has said to me, we ought to be  looking to try and open up this process  again. We were not allowed to do so in  the PAYGO debate and address  the  number one concern of this government right now, which is the runaway  spending. We have not been allowed to  do so in any of the appropriations bills,  and if we are going to be here through  the weekend, as the gentleman may  suggest, why isn’t it we couldn’t take  that time to debate the DOD bill in an  open and full, transparent manner?  I yield.  ",2009

At the informal debate in 1959, Mr.  Khruschchev predicted wrongly  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  overtake  America  in economic prosperity. As  Time Magazine reported, Vice President Nixon managed in a unique way to  personify a national character proud of  peaceful accomplishment, such as its  way of  life, confident of  its power  under threat.  Today,  I pay tribute to President  Nixon for his diplomacy and his years  of service to the Nation, including at  the Kitchen Debate 50 years ago today.  f  FOREIGN WORKERS AND U.S.  AIRCRAFT  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)

325,,111,0.512,148,2009-07-24,Mr. HUNTER.," Madam Speaker, pursuant to  the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of  H.R. 3288,  the Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for FY 2010:  I originally requested $2 million in this legislation for the Improvements to State Route 52  East/West project  through  the Federal Highway Administration’s Transportation & Community & System Preservation account.  It  is  my understanding  that $400,000 was ultimately appropriated  for  this project by  the  Subcommittee and the entity to receive funding for this project is the San Diego Association of Governments  (SANDAG),  located at  401 B Street, Suite 800, San Diego, California  92101.  This project seeks to add Managed Lanes  and extends  the  freeway  to greatly  improve  traffic flow in East San Diego County on SR52  from 1–15, east to SR67, including a freeway  exchange at SR52 and SR67, allowing for traffic flow to be reversed during peak periods.  This project has been identified as ‘‘high-priority’’ by local and state transportation agencies as it will provide residents living in East  County better access  to employment  in  the  western part of the region while also relieving  congestion on existing freeways and local arterials. For example, the completed project is  expected to reduce traffic on Interstate 8 by as  much as 20%.  I also originally requested $2 million in this  legislation  for  the Bradley Ave/State Route  (SR)–67 Interchange project through the Federal Highway Administration’s Transportation &  Community & System Preservation account. It  is my understanding  that $400,000 was ultimately appropriated  for  this project by  the  Subcommittee and the entity to receive funding for this project is the County of San Diego,  located at 5555 Overland Avenue, San Diego,  California 92123.  The Bradley Ave/SR–67 Interchange experiences heavy congestion during  the morning  and afternoon commute and currently operates at a failing level of service during peak  traffic hours. This project will provide congestion  relief  for  the  residential neighborhoods  east of SR–67, the businesses west of SR–67  and  regional  commuters by widening 0.75  miles of Bradley Avenue  from  two  lanes  to  four, add lanes to the SR–67 on-ramps and  off-ramps and replace the narrow existing 2-  lane Bradley Avenue bridge over SR–67 with  a 6-lane bridge. New bike lanes and sidewalks  will also be incorporated into this project on  Bradley Avenue.  Bradley Avenue is a key part of San Diego’s  Regional Arterial System and is classified as a  Major Road. Improvements to this interchange  will address  local accessibility and  regional  mobility, all  joint goals of County of San  Diego, Caltrans, SANDAG, City of El Cajon  and City of Santee, substantially alleviating  congestion and improving traffic flow through  the area. This is particularly necessary during  commuter hours, but essential during disasters  and evacuations which have occurred twice in  the past five years.  Finally, I requested, and the Subcommittee  appropriated, $250,000  in  this  legislation  for  the East County Boys & Girls Club Teen Center project through the Housing and Urban Development’s Economic Development Initiatives  account. The entity to receive funding for this  project is the Boys & Girls Club of East County Foundation, Inc., located at 8820 Tamberly  Way, Santee, California 92071.  The East County Boys & Girls Club Teen  Center project focuses on the rehabilitation of  the 48-year-old Boys & Girls Club building and  conversion of the Wells Park Fieldhouse into  a facility that can service young adults. With  the rehabilitation of both facilities, the number  of El Cajon youth that can be served will increase from 230 to 400 per day. The Boys &  Girls Clubs of East County have provided a  number of recreational, cultural and leadership  programs that promote good behavior, active  lifestyles and a positive alternative  to  the  streets. By converting the existing Clubhouse  to a center for 6–10 year olds, and relocating  the 11–18 year old population  to  the new  Teen Center, the Boys & Girls Club will enhance  learning environments  for both populations  resulting  in  improved  academic  achievement,  citizenship,  decreasing  police  contact and vastly  improving health  through  childhood obesity and athletic programs.

326,,111,-0.401,155,2009-07-24,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker,  this year  marks the 35th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), the single largest provider of civil legal aid for the poor in the nation. Established by Congress in 1974, LSC is  a private, nonprofit organization that promotes  equal access to justice and provides grants for  high-quality civil  legal assistance  to  low-income Americans. The people who come  to  LSC-funded programs  for help are  the most  vulnerable among us: women seeking protection from abuse, mothers trying to obtain child  support,  families  facing unlawful evictions or  foreclosures that could leave them homeless,  disaster victims trying to obtain federal emergency assistance or insurance payments to rebuild their lives. In fact, three out of four clients are women—many of whom are struggling to keep their children safe and their families together.  LSC’s work is more important than ever before, partly because of the impact of the current recession. Economic downturns affect the  poor disproportionately and add to the pressures on the nation’s public health and safety,  child welfare, housing and jobs programs. Ensuring  that  the  poor  are  adequately  represented in the civil judicial system greatly improves their chances of keeping or securing  basic necessities—the keys  to stability and  self-sufficiency.  It also helps keep communities healthy. For low-income individuals and  families,  legal services often  represent  their  only means of access to the justice system.  Nearly 51 million people—including 17.6 million children—are eligible for LSC-funded services. LSC-funded programs close nearly one  million cases per year nationwide and provide  other assistance to more than five million people. The clients served are at or below 125  percent of the federal poverty threshold, an income of about $27,000 a year for a family of  four. An overwhelming demand for civil legal  services exists. Based on a 2005 study, 50  percent of eligible potential clients requesting  assistance  from LSC-funded programs are  turned away for lack of adequate program resources. At a time when poor Americans are  struggling to keep their jobs, homes, and basic  necessities  for  their  families,  it  is crucial  for  the federal government to continue to address  the civil legal needs of these vulnerable people as a national priority. Fortunately, LSC has  broad bipartisan support for a strong federal  role in access to equal justice efforts.  On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of  the Legal Services Corporation, I welcome my  fellow Members of Congress to join me in recognizing the critical role that the Legal Services Corporation plays in helping America live  up to its commitment to ensure equal access  to justice for all. LSC and its grantees are to  be commended  for  the vital work  they do  every day on behalf of clients  in desperate  need of counsel.  f  CONGRATULATING LITHUANIA ON  1000TH ANNIVERSARY  SPEECHOF  HON.

331,,111,0.343,162,2009-07-24,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to officially recognize the new Rolland-Warner Middle School in Lapeer, Michigan, which is named in honor of Doris F. Rolland and the late Ronald C. Warner. The community is preparing to mark this special occasion with a dedication ceremony on August  27th at the site of the new facility.  The process to name the school took nearly  two months, and it was anything but simple  and easy considering  there was an exceptional  list of 19 possible candidates  to pick  from. Any one of these individuals would have  been an excellent choice to receive this honor.  But  in  the end,  the members of  the Lapeer  Community Schools, LCS, Board of Education  voted unanimously  to name  the  facility  the  Rolland-Warner Middle School.  Mrs. Doris Rolland truly is an extraordinary  person, and I commend her for her dedication  and  tireless work  to educate  the youth of  Lapeer County. Mrs. Rolland still resides  in  beautiful Mayfield Township with her husband.  Her resume speaks volumes about her commitment and devotion to help children succeed  in academics and  life, and especially  those  with special needs. Mrs. Rolland was both a  teacher and principal at Woodside School at  Oakdale, which coincidentally is the site of the  new facility. In addition, she supervised a staff  of 300 people who worked in the residential  unit,  the  research  unit  and  the  unit  that  housed students with emotional  impairment.  Mrs. Rolland also served for 10 years as director of special education  that served 750  students and 200 staff. She demonstrated unwavering passion  for her work, and never  questioned her mission. I thank her for her devoted spirit and willingness to assist the future  of Lapeer, and I also want to offer my sincere  congratulations on this very appropriate honor.  Mr. Ronald Warner held many positions during his 41 plus years career in the education  field that concluded in 1984 when he retired  as the Assistant Superintendent for the Lapeer  Community Schools. However, Mr. Warner  sadly passed away in June of 2008 at a tremendous loss to the community. My heartfelt  condolences go out to his family and friends.  And his  family should rest assured  that his  spirit and legacy continue to live on. Mr. Warner began his career in Almont and held various  teaching  and  administrative  positions  within  the district. Mr. Rolland consistently  demonstrated to his students and colleagues  an outstanding capacity for leadership and the  ability  to make  a  positive  difference. He  helped countless young people learn and grow  by challenging  them  to expand  their minds.  His contributions are greatly appreciated, and  I could not think of a better way to show this  gratitude other than by placing his name on  the new school. His  family should be extremely proud of this achievement, and I applaud Mr. Rolland posthumously on this wonderful acknowledgement.  August 27th will be a great day  for  the  Lapeer Community Schools District and for the  City of Lapeer as  they pay  tribute  to Mrs.  Doris Rolland and Mr. Ronald Warner, and I  am pleased to have had the opportunity to do  the same. I want to thank all parties involved  for their hard work during the nomination process. The community can stand proud of these  two individuals as they have their names remembered  forever on  the new  facility. They  are rightfully deserving of this prestigious distinction because they have laid a strong foundation on which to build and expand upon.

334,,111,-0.288,176,2009-07-24,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize a true hometown hero. On  Tuesday, July 14, 2009, while on patrol, Officer W. Thomas Lee of the Smithfield Police  Department  in  Smithfield, North Carolina,  saved a couple and their three children from  an early morning house fire.  Officer Lee was on patrol  just after 2:00  a.m. when he saw a car burning at 1411 W.  Market Street in Smithfield, where Javier Ramirez, Maria Mejia and their children, ages 12  to 18, were sleeping. Lee banged loudly on  the front door and on several windows before  managing to wake the family. The family was  able to exit the structure through a bedroom  window  to avoid moving about  the burning  home. Fortunately, no one was  injured. The  fire had spread  to  the attic and roof of  the  house by the time firefighters arrived just before 2:20 a.m., Smithfield Fire Marshal Paul  Whitehurst said. The blaze began when  the  engine of  the  family’s 2003 Ford Mustang  caught fire. In a statement the family said, ‘‘if  it hadn’t been for the police officer that saw  [the fire], it would have been a very different  situation.’’ Madame Speaker, this is an understatement.  It is first-class citizens like Officer Lee who  highlight  the sense of community and duty  shared by all our  first  responders. These  emergency personnel work tirelessly on behalf  of our communities and I would like to take  this time to recognize their achievements. Officer Lee is truly a hometown hero and I ask my  colleagues to join in congratulating his bravery  and integrity.  HON. J.

I have received $700,000 in the in the Department  of Health  and Human Services,  Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA)-Health Facilities and Services Account  for the Stewart-Marchman-Act Foundation, Inc.  Daytona Beach, FL  located at 214 Loomis  Ave. Daytona Beach, FL 32114.  Federal funding will allow the construction of  the Vince Carter Sanctuary, a 100-bed substance abuse  treatment, education, and  research center to be located in Bunnell, Florida  (Flagler County) on land donated for this purpose by the Flagler County Commission. This  request seeks to assist in the total financing of  this $8 million project as 80% of  the  total  funds have been generated from local philanthropic contributions. The Vince Carter Sanctuary will  impact  the economy of  the region  and create 75 new jobs to operate the facility.  These new positions will have an average salary of $32,500, thus reflecting over $2.5 million in direct salary expenditures. The Sanctuary will have a $56 million impact from the  construction funds and an annual $17 million  from operations, for a total of $73 million for  the first year. These funds will have a significant impact upon the local Northeast Florida  economy.  Madam Speaker, I also received $100,000  in the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)—Health Facilities and Services  Account  for  the Florida Hospital Altamonte,  Altamonte Springs, FL  located at 601 East  Altamonte Drive Altamonte Springs, FL 32701.  With infant abductions a growing concern in  hospitals  (256  infant abductions  in  the US  since 1983), federal funding for the HUGS Infant Security Initiative would provide a defense  against  this matter. Funding will be used  to  purchase and implement the HUGS Infant Security Electronic System  for Florida Hospital  Altamonte OB and MIU departments in order  to prevent unauthorized  transportation of  infants and abduction.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

Funds will enable TANK to purchase  new buses needed  for safety and capacity  issues. Newer buses will also help to achieve  better fuel economy and have cleaner emissions than the buses currently in use and in  need of replacement. The current buses that  will be replaced have been  in operation  for  one  to  two  years  beyond  their FTA-recommended useful life (13 to 14 years of operation). This project is a good use of taxpayer  funds because it will improve safety, capacity  and energy efficiency.

MARIO DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 24, 2009  Mr.  MARIO  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker, I submit the following.

This funding will be used for the development of a pioneer center of excellence for a  Pediatric Integrative Medicine Model, the following benefits will be realized: The University  of Miami will become a resource for other institutions in the community as well as nationally who are interested in this model of care.  By becoming a center of excellence, our patient population would have the advantage of  receiving the most comprehensive care that is  available nationwide. The  collaboration between CAM practitioners and clinicians can increase  the  respect between  the  two health  care delivery systems; may also establish trust  by eliminating the competition usually occurring between the two fields. The holistic approach of most CAM interventions and therapies can  increase awareness of health and  wellness in children at an early age. With the  impact  that  lifestyle and behavior have on  health, children can reap the benefits of this  early awareness well into adulthood. Through  our Pediatric Integrative Medicine Model, the  University of Miami would be poised to revolutionize pediatric care and advance the use of  CAM as part of standard care. Specific  targeted substudies may include: Water, one of  the most important elements in our bodies yet  one whose intake in children is universally limited. Exploring increased hydration therapy in  children would be an inexpensive home-based  intervention for improving health. Enzyme Deficiency, Implicated as a cause of illness and  as an effecter of health, enzyme deficiencies  can be improved through supplementation with  natural products  such as wheatgrass,  raw  juices and living foods. Ambient Lighting and  Light Therapy, extended hospitalizations  reduce exposure to sunlight, potentially causing  Vitamin D deficiency. Would supplementation  through Vitamin D-rich  foods be effective  in  preventing  this deficiency? Additionally, are  there other adverse health effects of certain  lighting techniques (e.g. fluorescent or flos-fluorescent light)? Probiotics, could probiotics be  useful in maintaining optimal colon health in  children?  If so, are  there dosage considerations  to be explored based on  the significantly smaller size of the colon? Furthermore,  can the use of probiotics reduce recovery time  in hospitalized children? Massage Therapy,  the negative  impacts of stress are present  throughout all age groups in the U.S., but the  data exploring CAM methods for stress reduction  in children  is sparse. Recognizing  the  benefits of massage  in adults and even  in  neonates, could massage be beneficial to children with elevated stress levels (whether that  stress  is psychological or biological such as  that  from chronic diseases)?  Is massage a  significant effecter of biological markers of  stress  (inflammation,  cytokines,  C-reactive  proteins etc.)? Others, exercise, polyunsaturated fatty acids, specific vitamin and other  nutritional  therapies, pediatric health behavior—adherence  to  CAM  therapies  and  changes in mood outcome expectations—the  possibilities are extensive.

The current Emergency  Department lacks sufficient space for a waiting  room for emergency room patrons. It also fails  to meet HIPPA compliance because of a lack  of privacy for patients due to a high-use public  hallway dissecting  the  two emergency room  locations.  In addition,  the current diagnostic  imaging facilities are scattered throughout the  hospital, which makes it more difficult to provide timely and efficient care. By consolidating  the services into one wing, the hospital will be  able to provide improved patient care and increase overall staff efficiency. Funding provided would be used for the design and construction of a new addition as well as a renovation of the existing facilities in the Emergency Department and Diagnostic  Imaging  Department.  Project Name: College of Southern Idaho’s  Pro-Tech Training Program  Amount Received: $200,000  Account: Department of Education Higher  Education  Recipient: College of Southern Idaho  Recipient’s Address:  315  Falls Avenue,  Twin Falls, ID 83303–1238  Description: This program will enable  the  College to partner with other agencies to identify training needs and to identify potential candidates for employment. Data provided by Region IV of the State of Idaho Economic Development Agency  indicate  that manufacturing  will be a  leading employment area  in  the  Magic Valley and the state of Idaho with over  250 new  jobs expected over  the next  two  years. Current trends in manufacturing development  necessitate  the  need  for  in-depth  training in the technological aspects of the design, fabrication, and manufacturing phases of  production. CSI is participating in a joint educational venture with Twin Falls High School  and local industry that creates a pre-engineering academy at the high school and a Computerized Numeric Controls  (CNC)/Industrial  Networking Program at  the college campus.  The Pro-Tech program volves students  from  grade levels 10–14, and allows the students to  move  from high school  into a  two-year program at CSI or into an engineering program at  one of  Idaho’s  four-year  institutions. At  the  secondary school level, students learn the basics of computer-assisted design, design physics, and fabrication, with each course offering  aligned to the program at CSI through either  tech prep or dual credit affiliation. At the post-  secondary level students will receive industry-  standard  training  in CNC, automated  logic,  and  industrial networking. This program will  train students to meet the educational requirements needed  to enable  them  to enter  the  high demand  fields of  the hi-tech manufacturing and engineering sectors.  Project Name: Custer County Purchase of  Medical Equipment  Amount Received: $400,000  Account: Health Resources and Services  Administration Health Facilities and Services  Recipient: Custer County  Recipient’s Address: 801 East Main Avenue,  Challis, ID 83226  Description: At almost 5,000 square miles,  Custer County is larger than three states yet  has just over 4,000 people. Unfortunately, it is  burdened with a high proportion of public  lands with over 95% of the county’s 3.4 million  acres administered by federal agencies. The  county’s tax base, or more specifically the lack  thereof, is inadequate to support the services  required for such an expansive county. This  grossly  disproportionate  public  ownership  causes a severe strain on their resources, including their ability to provide access to health  services. The influx of tourism and visitors due  to the nearby US Forest Service, BLM, recreation and wilderness areas  leads  to an  increased rate of trauma and accidents, placing  a large burden on the county. The EMT services and health clinics  in  the county are  in  need  of  renovation  and modernization  of  equipment. This funding would be used to purchase the much needed equipment and technology  for  the clinics and EMT services  in  Custer County.  Project Name: Idaho Caring Foundation for  Children  for dental services  for  low-income  children  Amount Received: $300,000  Account: Health Resources and Services  Administration Health Facilities and Services  Recipient: Idaho Caring Foundation for Children  Recipient’s Address: 1211 W. Myrtle, Suite  110, Boise, ID 83702  Description: According to the 2000 U.S. Surgeon General’s report, ‘‘Oral Health in America’’, tooth decay is the single most common  chronic childhood disease. As a dentist, I understand the importance of proper dental hygiene at a very young age. Poor oral health  can affect a child’s self-esteem, ability to eat,  appearance  and  ability  to  communicate.  School attendance can also be negatively impacted. Over 35% of Idaho children lack dental insurance, which serves as a major deterrent in accessing and receiving needed dental  care. According to Idaho Department of Health  and Welfare 2005 Smile Survey, 27% of Idaho  children in grades K–6 had untreated decay.  Low-income,  uninsured  children  suffer  the  greatest  incidence of dental decay because  their families lack the financial resources to receive regular dental care. The  Idaho Caring  Foundation will provide access to needed dental services  for 600  low-income, uninsured  Idaho children. These services will be provided by our network of 140  Idaho dentists  from across the state. Eligible children will be  identified by working in partnership with Idaho  schools, Head Start programs, and other children’s programs, such as the YMCA and the  Boys & Girls Clubs.  Project Name: Idaho Early Literacy Project  Amount Received: $350,000  Account: Department of Education Elementary and Secondary Education  Recipient: Lee Pesky Learning Center  Recipient’s Address:  3324 Elder Street,  Boise, ID 83705.  Description: The aim of the Idaho Early Literacy Project is to ensure that all children in  Idaho are  ready  to  read when  they enter  school. Stage III includes utilization of the research-based booklets, ‘‘Every Child Ready to  Read and Every Child Ready for Math’’, an integrated  approach  to  reading  and mathematical literacy, the training of child care providers statewide, both live and on-line, and a  direct  intervention with parents and children.  The training of child care providers includes a  face-to-face approach in larger population centers and an on-line approach for remote rural  locations. Stage  III builds on early  literacy  training models implemented in 2008–2010 by  unifying reading and mathematical literacy and  by strengthening the intervention with parents  and children. As such, the project assures that  pre-school children will receive direct literacy  education  from child care providers and  in  special workshops with their parents, creating  the  ‘‘language rich’’ upbringing necessary  to  succeed in school.

The objective is to develop a distance learning  program that will provide extended education  to  full-time  employed Certified Registered  Nurse Anesthetists who are located in rural or  metropolitan areas of the United States. This  project  provides  education  via  new  technologies,  including distance  learning methodologies, and addresses the Health People  2010 goal set by HHS to eliminate health disparities.  Texas Wesleyan University  is  located at  1201 Wesleyan Street, Fort Worth, TX 76105.  AB Christian Learning Center, Stop Six  Community Go Center, Fort Worth  ISD and  Fort Worth Metropolitan Black Chamber of  Commerce—Department of Education Higher  Education (FIPSE)—$175,000  The Stop Six Community Go Center provides a safe environment  in which students  can explore higher education and career options, financial aid resources, apply for scholarships and receive counseling services to assist  in  facilitating a seamless  transition  from  high school to college. This funding will help  the Go Center hire another academic advisor  and a security guard.  AB Christian Learning Center is located at  5009 Brentwood Stair Road #101, Fort Worth,  TX 76112.  City of Fort Worth, Early Childhood Development Program—Department of Health &  Human Services Administration  for Children  and Families  (ACF)—Social Services, Early  Childhood Matters Initiative—$425,000  The city of Fort Worth, Texas seeks funds  to support key projects  that will significantly  advance the Early Childhood Matters Initiative.  Early Childhood Matters, a community  initiative led by the city that impacts the entire region, will help coordinate resources and programs to benefit children up to 5 years of age.  Training and materials from early childhood resource centers will be used by parents and  child care providers. The funds will be used to  continue two existing early childhood resource  centers and start up two new locations in facilities  in  high  need  neighborhoods. Each  neighborhood resource center provides training, support, educational materials and leadership development  for parents, children, and  child care staff. Together, the 4 resource centers will  reach 500 parents, 280 child care  staff, and 1,200 children under five years old.  Each $1 expended for early childhood training  will result  in savings of $7 per child due  to  children not being retained a year at school,  taking special education classes, or dropping  out of school.  City  of Fort Worth  Throckmorton  Street,  76102.  Parkland  Health  and  Hospital  System  (PHHS), Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation, Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas—Department of Health & Human Services Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration  (HRSA)—Health  Facilities  and  Services—  $100,000  PHHS proposes  to use electronically derived variables to create a model that measures clinical, social, and economic factors that  predict patients at-risk for hospitalization, readmission or death in real-time, which would create ‘‘e-coordinated’’ clinical and care management interventions for the highest risk patients  and serves lives while improving patient services,  increasing  productivity,  and  reducing  costs.

343,,111,0.252,218,2009-07-24,Mr. PLATTS.," Madam Speaker, pursuant to  the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of  H.R. 3293, Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act.  Requesting Member: Congressman TODD  RUSSELLPLATTS(PA–19)  Bill Number: H.R. 3293—Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act  (1) York College of Pennsylvania—Facilities  and Equipment—$300,000  Account: Higher Education, FIPSE  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: York College of Pennsylvania  Address of Requesting Entity: 441 Country  Club Road, York, PA 17403  Description of Request/Justification of Federal Funding: York College of Pennsylvania is  a private, four-year institution of higher education serving over 5,600 students. This is a  good use of taxpayer funds because York College would use  this  funding  to expand  their  existing  Nursing  Department.  Specifically,  funds would be used to refurbish laboratories  and purchase equipment related to the project.  This is also a good use of taxpayer funds because York College operates one of the largest bachelorette nursing programs in the region. York College’s ability  to continue providing a pool of highly educated and trained  nursing graduates helps fill the critical demand  for nurses, both locally and nationally.  (2) Hanover Hospital—Electronic Medical  Records Initiative—$450,000  Account: HRSA, Health Facilities and Services  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Hanover  Hospital  Address of Requesting Entity: 300 Highland  Avenue, Hanover, PA 17331  Description of Request/Justification of Federal Funding: Hanover Hospital would use this  funding  to convert all paper  records at  the  hospital to an electronic medical record system. This is a good use of taxpayer dollars because the use of such records is proven to improve clinical outcomes and enables health  systems  to better define, measure, monitor,  and  reward quality care. Electronic medical  records create efficiencies for patients, physicians, and the hospital.  (3) WellSpan Health of York, PA—Purchase  of Equipment—$100,000  Account: HRSA, Health Facilities and Services  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: WellSpan  Health  Address of Requesting Entity: 912 South  George Street, York, PA 17403  Description of Request/Justification of Funding: WellSpan Health would use this funding to  purchase a remote monitoring system for the  York Hospital Emergency Transitional Care  Unit, allowing physicians to monitor patients in  a distant location without physically leaving the  main Emergency Department. This is a good  use of  taxpayer  funds because  the  remote  monitoring system would create  remote access  using  video/audio  conferencing  technology so that a physician could monitor multiple patients at one  time.  In addition, while  caring for a patient in the main emergency department,  the physician could answer questions and communicate with patients and families who are waiting in the Emergency Transitional Care Unit, eliminating the constant disruption of walking back and forth.

344,,111,0.509,225,2009-07-24,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to congratulate two cities in my district for being named to the list of 100 best  small towns to live in in America by Money  Magazine.  Columbus was recognized for its low jobless  rate with its industry and manufacturing infrastructure providing employment for more than  5,700. Columbus is home to major agricultural  equipment companies and the Nebraska Public Power District. Glur’s Tavern, the oldest bar  west of the Missouri River reminds residents  of the days when Buffalo Bill Cody frequented  the area.  Money Magazine took note of Norfolk’s public school system. The 13 schools in the K12  district are relatively diverse,  teacher-student  ratios are often under 1:20, and  the  ‘‘Challenge’’ program offers differentiated instruction  for academically talented children. It was also  pointed out that Norfolk is a major retail trade  center for northeast Nebraska, and the manufacturing  industry  in  the city employs more  than 4,000 people.  These designation weren’t accidents. Columbus and Norfolk are strong communities of  people who care for each other, who help out  during hard  times, and who  live up  to  the  benchmarks set by our forefathers.  So, congratulations to Columbus and Norfolk for representing Nebraska and making us  proud.  f  OLAJU ‘‘O.J.’’ GREEN  HON.

O.J. was a not only an excellent student in  the classroom, but was also a  leader and  standout athlete  for Canal Winchester High  School’s Football Team. He was both dedicated and hardworking,  leading his  football  team to qualify for the state playoffs.  In addition  to his successes  in  the classroom and on the football field, he was also a  great artist. I met O.J. through his participation  in the 7th Congressional District Art Show. His  pencil drawing submitted for the art show was  thought provoking and clearly showed his talent. It was an honor for me to meet this bright,  well-rounded and articulate young man.  My thoughts and prayers are with the family  and friends during this time of terrible loss.

346,House,111,0.387,9,2009-07-31,Mr. BACHUS.," I yield myself 1 additional minute.  These are the same government agencies that regulated AIG, Countrywide,  and collectively failed to prevent the  worst  financial  calamity  since  the  Great Depression. If it took them 30  years to catch Bernie Madoff, do you  really think the SEC can do a better  job of  identifying  inappropriate risk  than the vast majority of financial institution executives whose businesses  have  remained  solvent during  these  challenging  times? Really,  now,  is  there any question who is better qualified or, for that matter, who ought to  be responsible  for setting compensation within an American corporation?  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this bill continues the Democrat majority’s tendency to go to the default solution for  every problem: create a government  bureaucracy to make decisions better  left to private citizens and private corporations. That’s what we did in cap-  and-trade. That’s what we did in the  health care proposals. And it’s this bill  on  executive  compensation. Government bureaucrats do not know what’s  best for America.  For those reasons, Mr. Speaker,  urge opposition to this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
347,House,111,-0.499,9,2009-07-31,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes to  deal with some of these comments.  First of all, I am struck by the fact  that the gentleman, as he indicated in  our markup,  is  sufficiently nervous  about the political implications of opposing this bill and having the House  take no action whatsoever to deal with  the problem of risk-incentivizing bonuses but he wants to debate cap-and-  trade and health care. They’re not before us. What’s before us is this bill.  And when Members debate the bills  that aren’t there,  it’s an  indication  that they’re a little shaky on the bills  that are there.  Secondly, yes, it does say that they  can deal with all wages but not in general. The gentleman reads very selectively. The language about taking action is in this context: to determine  whether the compensation structure is  aligned with sound risk management,  is structured to account for the time  horizon of risks, and will reduce unreasonable incentives by such institutions  for employees to take undue risks.  It is limited in its grant of authority  only to structures that incentivize excessive risk. There is no mandate here  to set wages for anybody. There is no  mandate to say this percentage is bonuses and that percentage is pay. It is  a mandate only to act where the structure incentivizes risk, as has been recognized as part of the problem, very  broadly.  I will plead guilty to one issue, yes.  We are not in this case taking orders  from the Obama administration. And  maybe having represented a party that  took orders from the Bush administration, they now wish they didn’t, but  that’s not an example I want to follow.  I am not here as a Member of Congress  or as chairman of a committee to do  whatever the administration says. I am  here  for us to put our  independent  judgment on it.  The gentleman closed with the key  difference between us: the Republican  position, as he articulates  it—and  I  don’t think it will be the unanimous  position—is have the Federal Government take no action whatsoever to restrain the granting of bonuses that  incentivize excessive risk. If they pay  back that TARP money having benefited from it—and, by the way, on the  bailout, every single bailout now underway happened under the Bush administration. But their position is, do  nothing to deal with this. We take the  opposite position.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2009
348,House,111,0.653,9,2009-07-31,Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  of H.R. 3269, the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness  Act of 2009.  Restoring confidence in our financial  markets  is  crucial, Mr. Speaker, a  component in bringing about economic  recovery. And I support efforts to responsibly address the issues that led to  the financial crisis that we’re facing  today.  However, H.R. 3269 does not do either.  Instead  of  addressing  the need  for  smarter regulation, this bill represents  further government intrusion into the  private sector that could ultimately  hinder economic recovery. If this legislation is passed, it will put in place far-  reaching and permanent government  regulations on the compensation practices of financial institutions, crippling  their ability to recruit top talent and  remain competitive abroad and here at  home.  Mr. Speaker, this bill goes too far by  giving the Federal Government the authority to make compensation decisions for a wide range of employees in  thousands of financial firms across the  United States, which we can all agree  is a far cry from just capping executive  pay.  In tough economic times like these,  we need to focus on ways to restore  confidence in America’s financial markets and increase the ability of American  businesses  through  responsible  policies that restore market discipline  and discourage excessive risk. I firmly  believe that we cannot have a successful economic recovery with the permanent overreaching regulations that this  puts in place by this legislation.  I therefore urge my colleagues to join  me in voting ‘‘no’’ on this legislation.  ",2009
349,House,111,-0.302,9,2009-07-31,Mr. SCOTT of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  let me just start out by saying this.  We’re hearing  complaints  from  the  other side that we are taking over the  private enterprise system; we are taking over the free enterprise system.  Let me remind them that it wasn’t  us that went to the private enterprise  system. It wasn’t the government that  went to Wall Street. Wall Street came  to the government to bail them out  from their behaviors.  Now, Mr. Speaker,  the American  landscape  is absolutely  littered with  company after company that has been  driven into the ground by executives  who were greedy, who were  selfish,  cared  only  about  themselves, with  these huge salaries, and these companies are left to wither on the vine after  they have gotten their golden parachutes and have landed elsewhere.  Somebody needs to say something  about the American people. This is a  free enterprise system, but it’s not just  free  for top executives. It’s  free  for  shareholders. It’s free for those men  and women who have given their lives,  their blood,  their  sweat, and  their  tears. And to see their companies in  shambles because of excessive pay by  executives who have abandoned those  companies, what about their pensions?  What  about  their  retirements  that  have gone?  No, Mr. Speaker, this is not about  taking over the private enterprise system. Mr. Speaker, this is about saving  and protecting the free enterprise system so that we all can be free to participate in this system.  Mr. Speaker, what we have before us  here is something because of the fact  that financial firms put together compensation packages and bonuses that  were based on  incentives, that were  laden with excessive risk, that caused  our financial crisis and brought this  economy to the edge of collapse and  caused us here in Congress to go and  get over $2 trillion of the American  taxpayers’ money to bail them out.  Now, the first order of business—and  this  is why this bill that Chairman  has pushed, and I’m proud to  say that we worked on this together  over 3 years ago. Had we had that bill  in place 3 years ago, we might not have  had this  financial crisis, because we  would have been able to rein in the  risky corporate behavior that brought  about the collapse. So that’s what we  are doing. We’re putting forward some  reasonable means here.  What is more reasonable than giving  the shareholders a simple say, a vote?  It’s nonbinding. We are not setting the  salaries. Even the shareholders are not.  But don’t they have a right? Isn’t it  their company? They are the ones that  are pumping the money into it.  The other feature about the bill, Mr.  Speaker, that is very simple, very reasonable, is that we require these compensation  committees  that  are  on  these boards to be independent. Right  now it’s a cozy relationship. The CEO  refers to them as his board.

350,House,111,-0.428,23,2009-07-31,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, today I’ve heard a number of interesting accusations about what this legislation would do  if passed.  I have  heard that the government will sit in  board rooms and set caps on pay. But  of course my constituents are accustomed to hearing these kinds of false  arguments  from  those who wish  to  maintain the status quo.  My constituents sent me to Congress  to move beyond the status quo of a broken  financial  regulatory  structure.  They sent me to enact commonsense  reforms like those included in the legislation we’re discussing  today, Mr.  Speaker. They know that average families have cut back, work longer hours,  and have saved their money during this  crisis. Meanwhile, Wall Street execs  have acted irresponsibly and enjoy the  lavish  compensation  packages  that  have allowed their companies to fail.  So I am proud to be an original cosponsor of  this bill  that will bring  about a new era of responsibility on  Wall Street. I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.  ",2009

352,House,111,-0.282,23,2009-07-31,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the comments of my friend  from New Jersey, but I would say the  word that comes to mind is ‘‘amnesia.’’  My friends on the Republican side of  the aisle have amnesia. They have amnesia over how the Bush administration  tried  to deregulate everything,  tried to make government smaller and  more ineffective so that we could have  Ponzi schemes as existed under Madoff.  That occurred under the George Bush  administration. We had  the  failure  with Katrina, and we had the biggest  collapse in the banking sector ever because of deregulation and a belief that  the free market could do anything it  wanted to do.  Now, this bill is very mild. What it  allows, Mr. Speaker, is it allows shareholders to have a say on what the officers of the company make in terms of  salary, the owners having a say on pay.  What could be more American and  more free enterprise than that?  What it does allow is the board of directors to overrule the shareholders if  they think that’s appropriate. But we  need to have the ownership of the company have a say on what their executives make so that it doesn’t get out of  line and that there is no back-scratching going on.  The  second piece  that my  friends  complain about and that the substitute  is designed to gut is that the Federal  banking regulators have a say on the  commissions and the bonuses and the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  03:05 Sep 28, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H31JY9.REC H31JY9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009

Finally we have a bailout, not for the  big businesses, not for Wall Street, but  a bailout for Main Street.

Aronovitz United  States Courthouse’’.  Judge Sidney M. Aronovitz served as a U.S.  District Court Judge for the Southern District  of Florida for 21 years. Aronovitz was born in  Key West, Florida, on June 20, 1920. After  graduating  from Key West High School  in  1937, he went on to attend the University of  Florida where he was awarded a bachelor of  arts degree in 1942, and a law degree, with  honors, in 1943. Aronovitz went on to serve as  a U.S. Army captain from 1943 to 1946, earning multiple distinctions,  including a Bronze  Star.  Between 1943 and 1976, Aronovitz served  as a lawyer in private practice in Miami, Florida. He also served as a City Commissioner  from 1962  to 1966, holding  the position of  Vice-Mayor in 1965. In 1976, President Gerald  Ford nominated Sidney M. Aronovitz to serve  as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Aronovitz was  commissioned on September 21, 1976, and  served as a U.S. District Court Judge until his  death in 1997. In addition, he periodically sat  on the U.S. Court of Appeals, 11th Circuit, and  served on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court from 1988 to 1992.  Judge Aronovitz served with distinction and  it is fitting that we honor him today with this  designation.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2913.

357,House,111,0.644,44,2009-07-31,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  before I came to Congress I spent 20-  plus years as a physician taking care of  folks in the north Atlanta area, so this  whole debate about the health care  bill, there are many aspects of it that  give me great concern. And the fact of  the matter is, Mr. Speaker, there are  many aspects of it that give the Nation  great concern.  So whether it’s the government-run  program or the takeover of health care  or whether it’s the potential for huge  mandates  from  the Federal Government, many aspects point to areas of  different concern for the American people. And one of them is the issue of rationing, the issue of whether or not the  Federal Government should be deciding  to what extent which Americans receive medical care.  So earlier this year when there was a  proposal that was passed in this House  and in the Senate signed by the President  for something called the Comparative Effectiveness Research Council, fancy name for a potential rationing board, many people voiced concerns  about that, as did I.  And what we heard from the other  side of the aisle, the majority party,  the Democrats, they said, Don’t worry  about that. There will be congressional  oversight. Congress will be able to hold  their feet to the fire. Well, Mr. Speaker, what’s now come out is that may  not be the case.  The  IMAC program, or  the  Independent Medicare Advisory Council, is  a proposal that is being added to the  current health care bill that would create  a new Presidentially  appointed  board  empowered  to  make  recommendations on  cost  savings proposals. These are very, very personal  medical decisions that we’re talking  about here, and cost savings proposals  oftentimes means rationing.  This proposal in the health care bill  right now would eliminate all congressional oversight of the Medicare program and put it in the hands of, you  guessed it, the White House and the  President. It creates a new executive  branch agency with unelected board  members appointed by the President to  make recommendations on the reductions in Medicare payment levels, reimbursement for providers, potentially  refusing to pay for services or care prescribed by doctors as they are deemed  not to be ‘‘cost efficient.’’ That’s the  language, Mr. Speaker.  The bill says that the reforms must  ‘‘either improve the quality of medical  care received by the beneficiaries of  the Medicare program or,’’ not and,  ‘‘improve the efficiency of the Medicare program’s operation.’’  Mr. Speaker, this is extremely concerning. This Congress has created the  Comparative Effectiveness Resources  Board that will have the power to ration care based on cost or quality. It  would make the board’s recommendations binding in the absence of action  by Congress within 30 days if the President approved the recommendation.  Now, many Members of Congress are  concerned  about  payment  rates  in  rural parts of the country, yet this  board eliminates State and community  input  into the Medicare program by  rendering  irrelevant the  influence of  local Medicare Carrier Advisory Communities, or MCACs, to develop and  implement policies expressly applicable to their patient population.  Further, it would reduce the availability of patient advocacy groups to  implement new policies that would improve the health care of our Nation’s  seniors.  The real concern as a physician is  that nonmedical people will be making  medical decisions. It’s a terrible idea.  It’s not what  the American people  want, and they are actually waking up  to the proposal that’s before Congress  right now. And that’s why you see the  numbers of support across this land decreasing.  Let’s move in a positive direction.  There is a positive direction, and that  is to allow quality decisions, medical  decisions to be made between patients  and their families and caring and compassionate physicians.  It’s a  simple  way to do it, not put it in the hands of  a bureaucrat, not put it in the hands of  the White House, not put  it  in the  hands of the President. Let patients  and doctors decide.  Mr. Speaker, that’s the right way.  Mr. Speaker, that’s the American way.

I am very proud to be an  original cosponsor of this legislation  and to join my good friend, Senator  JACKREED, along with Senators TIM  and PATTYMURRAY, on addressing the tragedy of homelessness  among our Nation’s veterans. My three  colleagues have been steadfast in their  resolve to address the needs of veterans, including the tragedy of homelessness, and I commend them.  Senator REEDhas been a strong and  committed leader on affordable housing and homeless issues and his leadership played a strong role in the recent  enactment of  the historic Homeless  Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act or HEARTH Act.  I am honored to join him again.  Like the HEARTH Act, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act  builds on our work over the past several years by focusing on the importance of permanent supportive housing.  Further, it takes important steps to  break down the barriers between the  Departments of Veterans Affairs, VA,  and Housing and Urban Development,  HUD, to ensure that veterans receive  the quality services and housing they  deserve and need.  The most notable element of the legislation is the authorization of HUD–  VA Supportive Housing or HUD–VASH  rental-assistance  vouchers. Working  with  Senator PATTY new  HUD–VASH vouchers have been funded  over the past 2 years. While other HUD  homeless-assistance  programs  serve  veterans, HUD–VASH is the only permanent housing program that is specifically targeted to veterans and tied  to veteran-specific supportive services  from the VA.

364,,111,-0.318,121,2009-07-31,Ms. KILROY.," Madam Speaker, today I introduce legislation, the ‘‘Medical Debt Relief Act  of 2009,’’ which would protect  those hard-  working Americans who play by the rules, pay  or settle their medical debts, yet find their economic well-being and  their credit scores adversely affected for years due to medical debt,  large or small, that has gone to collection.  The  ‘‘Medical Debt Relief Act of 2009’’  would prohibit all consumer credit agencies  and creditors  from using paid off or settled  medical debt collection  in assessing a consumer’s creditworthiness.  Medical debt  is unique. Americans don’t  choose when accidents happen or when  illness strikes. Medical debt collection issues affect both insured and uninsured.  According to credit evaluators, medical debt  collections are more likely to be in dispute, inconsistently  reported,  and  of  questionable  value  in predicting  future payment performance because it is atypical and non-predictive.  Nevertheless, medical debt  that has been  completely paid off or settled can significantly  damage a consumer’s credit score for years.  As a result, consumers can be denied credit  or pay higher  interest  rates when buying a  home or obtaining a credit card.  The issue of medical debt affects millions. In  fact, according  to  the Commonwealth Fund,  medical bill problems or accrued medical debt  affects roughly 72 million working-age adults  in American. For 2007, 28 million working-age  American adults were contacted by a collection agency for unpaid medical bills.  f  RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF ROUND  ROCK, TX  HON. JOHN R.

366,,111,-0.265,128,2009-07-31,Mr. BOUCHER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor a southwest Virginia resident  whose service to this Nation will long be remembered. On June 17, 2009, Darrell ‘‘Shifty’’  Powers, a distinguished World War II veteran,  passed away. I would like to take this occasion  to  recognize  his many  contributions  through his military service to our great Nation. Mr. Powers, who was portrayed  in  the  HBO documentary film ‘‘Band of Brothers,’’ is  a true American hero from southwest Virginia.  A native of the Dickenson County, Town of  Clinchco, Virginia, Mr. Powers volunteered for  the United States Army  during  the  early  stages of the Second World War in 1942. He  was quickly assigned  to  the newly  formed  506th Parachute Infantry Regiment and began  training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. Each day,  the new recruits would train by running 6 miles  up and down the Curahee Mountain. As a result of the steadfast dedication of Mr. Powers  and the other members of what came to be  known as Easy Company, the regiment was  quickly  transformed  into one of  the Army’s  toughest fighting units.  In  1943,  after  completion  of  parachute  school at Ft. Benning, Georgia, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry was attached to the 101st Airborne Division and was  transferred  to England, where  they would  spend a year preparing  to  invade  the European continent.  At about 1 a.m. on June 6, 1944, Mr. Powers and the other members of Easy Company  boarded  a  plane which  transported  them  across the English Channel in order to parachute into Normandy behind German fortified  positions. Shortly after  landing, Mr. Powers  and 2 fellow soldiers realized that they were a  day’s walk from their intended drop zone. The  Airborne troops spent almost a week fighting  German soldiers before they were sent back  to England to prepare for an invasion of Holland.  In September 1944, Mr. Powers’ unit, along  with Polish and English divisions, parachuted  into Holland to secure a road for tanks and  supply shipments to prepare for a push across  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:28 Aug 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.063 E31JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2009

369,,111,-0.491,142,2009-07-31,Ms. PELOSI.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to a beloved friend of mine and  many in this body, Martha Dodd Buonanno.  Martha Buonanno would best like to be remembered as a mother, grandmother, and  wife. She died after a brief illness on July 6,  2009. Her  five  children, Helena, Bernard,  Carolyn, Jody, and Margaret, and 17 grandchildren  surrounded  their  father  Bernard  Buonanno crying and laughing as they celebrated the life of this remarkable woman.  Her love of family and children led her to  volunteer  for many worthy organizations  in  Rhode  Island. She was a mentor  in Providence public schools with the VIPS program;  she served on the boards of the Providence  Preservation Society and the RI Association of  the Blind. She was proud to chair the research  center at  the University of Connecticut  that  had been named in honor of her father: Thomas J. Dodd.  Martha and I became friends more than 50  years ago at Trinity College  in Washington,  DC. We shared in common that we both came  from political families—in fact, when we first  met, both of our fathers were running for Senate.  But our  friendship grew over many years  because we had so much more in common:  Martha loved to travel, she loved to laugh, and  always, Martha  loved Democratic politics.  In  fact, Martha volunteered on every single one  of her brother, Senator CHRISTOPHERDODD’s,  campaigns. She adored all her siblings: CHRIS,  Tom, Carolyn, Jeremy, Nick.  Martha Dodd Buonanno had a strong connection to this House, where her father and  her brother served. She lived and raised her  family in Providence and was admired by our  colleagues  and  JIM  LANGEVIN, and Senators JACKREEDand SHELroots were  in Connecticut and Congresswoman ROSADELAURO  and  Congressmen  JOE  COURTNEY, and CHRISMURPHY join me in expressing condolences  to  the Buonanno and  Dodd families.  It is a fitting tribute to Martha’s life that more  than 3,000 people attended her wake, lining  the streets for more than seven hours. Her funeral mass was moved from her parish to another simply to be able to accommodate everyone. Those who came to pay their last respects  to Martha  included Vice President  BIDEN, United States Senators, and a Governor; but Martha would have been equally  proud to know that children that she tutored,  neighbors  from her block, and  friends  from  growing up joined that day. As I know well,  when Martha made  a  friend,  she  stayed  friends with them forever.  DONWHITEHOUSE. Her  KENNEDY PATRICK JOHN LARSON,  Although Martha was always a sparkling  personality, she became even more so when  she met Bernie. Their love, and their children  and grandchildren, are her lasting legacy.  I hope it is a consolation to her family that  all of her classmates at Trinity College loved  her for more than 50 years, and will miss her.  I am honored to place in the RECORD the  extraordinary eulogy of her beloved brother,  Senator CHRISDODD, which captures her spirit  and honors her life.  A TRIBUTETOMYFABULOUSSISTERMARTHA  (By Christopher J. Dodd)  Before sharing some brief comments about  my sister Martha, I want to observe that  anything I say will only pale in comparison  to the incredible comments of Martha and  Bernie’s children, and the outpouring of love  and friendship that over 3,000 people shared  for over 7 hours at last evening’s wake.  It was obviously a great tribute to Martha—but it is also a great tribute to all who  waited  for hours to say good by to this  bright, shining lady.  Now, let me begin with the obvious: My  sister Martha is one fabulous gal!  And so we gather today to celebrate the  life of a spectacular wife, a devoted mother,  an  over-the-top  grandmother,  a  trusted  fiend, a tireless community activist, a political confidant, an amazing spark plug of a  woman, and the best sister a sibling could  ever hope to have.  When most people lose loved ones, they instinctively wish they could have had just a  little more time with them. The Dodds and  the Buonannos were lucky enough to be with  Martha constantly in the last days of her  life.  And those last days were beautiful. Even  as I say these words, they sound so inherently contradictory.  Yet for a little more than a week, my sister  insisted on spending time alone with  each of her five children and their spouses,  each of her 17 grandchildren, each of her five  siblings, as many of her close friends as were  available, and, of course, Bernie.  How many of us have lost someone without  ever having a chance to say goodbye, or the  chance to tell them how much they meant to  us?  Martha left us with remarkable dignity,  grace, and courage. She had the incredible  gift of deep, deep faith. She was truly at  peace.  And even though Martha has left us, we remain brightly lit by the incandescent life she  led. Frankly, as sad as we are today, it’s  hard not to be overwhelmed with joy and  love when we think about a life filled with  such vitality and vigor, curiosity and compassion.  Martha was a few years older than me. At  least, that was the case until about twenty  years ago. I was always the younger brother  until one night at the Dunes Club in Narragansett, when  she  introduced me as her  older, white-haired brother.  But, for most of our lives, she made for one  heck of a big sister.  I learned early how special my sister Martha was.  One summer afternoon, decades ago, we  were about to head off for a family vacation.  Our bags were packed, the station wagon was  full, and all of us were itching to get out of  town—but Martha’s 8th-grade championship  softball game was running late. So we all  waited together and watched.  In the bottom of the ninth, with the bases  loaded and her team behind, my sister Martha hit a grand slam home run to win the  game and the championship.  As I sat next to her on that car trip for our  family vacation, I was filled with the kind of  awe you only feel when you’re a fourth-grader with  the requisite dreams of being a  sports hero and you’ve just watched your  twelve-year-old sister win the big game.  Every time I drive by that softball field in  West Hartford, Connecticut, I can’t help but  think back to the day I officially, and forever after was dazzled by my big sister.  Nothing Martha ever did was shy or tentative. When she was just a toddler, during  World War II, she once devoured our entire  family’s monthly ration of butter. And when  our father wrote home from Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945, he always made sure to ask  how ‘‘Miss Butter’’ was doing.  Over the years, Martha never lost her love  of a good meal, but the most important part  of any meal, any occasion for that matter,  was always the company with which she enjoyed it.  If Martha were your dinner partner, you  never had a better or more enjoyable time in  your life. She was that much fun.  Like most people with a vibrant spirit and  a contagious personality, she made a lot of  friends in her life.  If you asked her, she’d tell you that our  sister Carolyn was her best friend in the  world. Martha had a lot of great friends, because when she made friends, she kept them  forever.  I.want to acknowledge the presence of several of my Senate colleagues who were with  us last evening and today.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi  is here with us  today. She and Martha became friends in college, and have been close ever since.  I have never known two people who were  better friends to their friends than my sister  Martha and her friend Nancy D’Alesandro  Pelosi.  I want to also thank my good friend, and a  Martha Dodd Buonanno fan, Vice President,  Joe Biden, for making the effort to be with  us yesterday.  Here also with us today are friends from  high school, friends from college, friends she  made during her 45 years in Rhode Island,  and friends she accumulated at every stop  along the way.  Martha was  fiercely  sively competitive.  She was a natural politico. She was involved and present in every part of every  campaign I ever ran  for Congress or the  United States Senate. She was my unflinching advocate, my unyielding supporter.  And when I ran for President—a very brief  run, you may recall—she showed up all over  South Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire—  and anywhere else there was a debate or  forum or town hall meeting.  No matter where we were, she put the hard  sell on anyone she encountered.  Even as her health was failing last week,  she promised me that she would tear into  any opponents I might have from wherever  she was.  And in light of my present political circumstances, I told her there’d be no lack of  opportunity to use her talents.  However,  along with Martha’s  loyalty  came the requirement that you stay true to  yourself. So, she had no problem calling me  anytime to tell me in no uncertain terms  when I was screwing up.  Once, she called me and practically jumped  through the phone. ‘‘Why did you vote with  Jesse Helms?’’ she asked.  I asked her,  ‘‘Well, what  talking about?’’  ‘‘I don’t care WHAT the issue is! I just  can’t believe you voted with Jesse Helms!’’  It is important to point out that Martha  could be non partisan in her outrage. She  had a similar outburst once when I voted  with my friend Bella Abzug!  When she was in her last days in the hospital in Boston, I received a very kind phone  call from President Barack Obama, who was  concerned about her failing health and wanted me to pass along his and the First Lady’s  thoughts and prayers.  After the call, I walked back into Martha’s  hospital room, and said in the presence of  her family that I had just received a very important phone call—but I didn’t want to be a  name-dropper.  loyal and compulissue are you  VerDate Nov 24 2008  06:28 Aug 01, 2009 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30JY8.105 E31JYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2009

And  in some  cases, I represent residents who are making a  swift transition between the two. This is especially true of Sammamish, a city of 40,000 that  was recently named by Money magazine as  the 12th ‘‘best place to live’’ in the entire country.  I rise today to congratulate Sammamish on  this  great  and well-deserved  achievement.  Nestled neatly on the eastern shore of Lake  Sammamish and  surrounded by a mix of  urban,  rural  and  beautiful  open  spaces,  Sammamish is as beautiful as it sounds.  Some of the qualities noted for their newly-  awarded  distinction  include  the  excellent  schools, safe neighborhoods and beautiful natural setting of the city. Of course, since I often  have  the opportunity  to visit Sammamish,  I  can definitely attest to that truth. Historically a  place of timber and agriculture, Sammamish,  barely ten years old, has impressed the entire  Pacific Northwest region with its rapid, elegant  and responsible development. The quality of  life, the political leadership and the energy of  its residents make Sammamish a very special  place.  Perhaps most  impressively, Sammamish  has invested heavily in infrastructure and an  expanding menu of city services without undermining its financial footing. Through careful  budgeting  and  long-term  planning,  Sammamish is moving ahead without leaving  responsible  habits  behind.  As  evidence,  Sammamish recently received Standard and  Poor’s highest bond rating—AAA.  I am proud to represent such a city in Congress and  look  forward  to continue working  with Sammamish residents and elected leaders  to continue  to make  it one of  the best  places to live long into the future. Working cooperatively,  the  residents  and  leaders  of  Sammamish  have  created  an  exceptional  place to live and visit in a short period of time.

371,,111,0.386,149,2009-07-31,Mr. TIBERI.," Madam Speaker, with great  pleasure I rise to recognize the distinguished  career of my constituent, Jim McCann.  For several decades, Jim served the Central  Ohio community as the principal of Westerville  North High School, passionately dedicating  himself to the education of thousands. We all  should strive  to make a difference  in  this  world, and Jim brought a remarkable level of  energy and decency to his job, winning admiration from the community for his commitment  to ‘‘The Warrior Way.’’  After retiring, Jim continued to give back to  the youth of Central Ohio by serving as a  chairman of my academy  selection board.  From that position, Jim took an active role in  mentoring applicants, often staying  in  touch  with them years after their first interview. To  this day, Jim continues to serve his community  in a number of civic committees, while also  still educating and guiding many youths in the  Westerville and Central Ohio area through his  home school program.  Through commendable volunteer work and  civic leadership, Jim stands as a pillar of the  Westerville, Ohio community. Therefore, I am  very pleased to thank him for all he has done  for our area.  I offer my congratulations to Jim McCann for  a career spent in service to others. I hope the  spirit he daily brings forth in his life and work  continues  to  inspire us  to action and a  renewed commitment to our country.  f  EARMARK DECLARATION  HON.

Carol Brooks Casey was a beloved citizen  with a long and distinguished record of community service.  Carol, a renowned radio announcer, began  her 32-year broadcasting career  in 1977 at  WMFC station  in Monroeville. Although she  initially professed a disinterest in radio, Carol  possessed self-confidence, determination, and  graciousness that earned her the affectionate  title ‘‘The Voice of Monroe County.’’ Her radiant presence brought joy to those with whom  she worked and earned her  ‘‘star  status’’  among her frequent listeners.  A leader for a host of philanthropic causes,  Carol was honored by the local Kiwanis Club  as its ‘‘2008 Citizen of the Year.’’ She served  as chairwoman for the Chamber of Commerce  Christmas Parade, was one of the organizers  of Excel’s Pioneer Days, established a Christmas toy drive for children, and helped promote  the national Angel Tree organization. She was  also an active member in a number of civic organizations,  including:  the American Cancer  Society, Peddlin’  for a Cure,  the American  Red Cross, Kiwanis Club of Monroeville, and  the Monroeville/Monroe Chamber  of Commerce, among others. She also organized the  first Veteran’s Day Parade in Monroe County  in 2007.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me  in  remembering a dedicated community  leader, a generous friend, and an inspirational  voice for Monroe County and Southwest Alabama. Carol will be dearly missed by her family—her husband, Mike Casey; her son, Calvin  Casey; her daughter, Adrienne Casey; her  three sisters, Helen Tucker, Land Watford,  and Wanda Brooks; and her brothers, Mike  Brooks and Cliff Brooks—as well as the countless friends and devoted listeners she leaves  behind.  Our  thoughts and prayers are with  during this difficult time.  Madam Speaker,  I ask  that  the  following  poem—written by Reverend Wayne McMillian,  pastor of the Mexia Baptist Church, as a tribute  to Carol—be entered  into  the CONGRESthem  SIONALRECORD:  A VOICEINTHEWIND  The Morning Dove arose with the dew  Her voice on the wind like pigeon flew  Bringing music, joy, and laughter she knew  Would brighten a dull and somber world.  She knew us well, that voice on the wind  The hand she held of many a friend  Through concerts, charities and raffles send  Help to the needy in this crippled world.  Now the Morning Dove from here has flown  Her voice on the wind, in a celestial dome  Yet the Waves she rode right here at home  Will be her legacy in that perfect world.  f  IN MEMORY OF MARY ALICE  ETHRIDGE  HON.

Established in  1909;  the Robbinsdale Fire Department has  dutifully  responded  to  fire  calls,  assisted  neighboring communities, extinguished structure fires, grass fires, vehicle fires, responded  to gas  leaks, hazardous material spills, and  advocated fire prevention through inspections  and community education. The members of  the  fire  department  are  residents  of  Robbinsdale who serve and protect their families, friends, and neighbors 365 days a year,  regardless of the perilous nature of their work.  I applaud  their dedication and service  to  their community. The professionalism of  the  Robbinsdale Fire Department is an inspiration  to those they serve. Their commitment to public service  is honorable and  I encourage all  who encounter past, present or future members of  the Robbinsdale Fire Department  to  thank  them  for  their selfless service  to  their  city. On behalf of the residents of Minnesota’s  Fifth Congressional District,  I commend  the  members of the Robbinsdale Fire Department  for  their hard work and sacrifice and wish  them well in their next century of service.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR.

377,,111,-0.385,184,2009-07-31,Ms. SPEIER.," Madam Speaker, I pay tribute  today to a man of God who dedicated his life  to improving the lives of those less fortunate.  Father Floyd Lotito, the heart and soul of St.  Anthony’s Dining Room, left our world on July  14, ending his long and valiant struggle with  Parkinson’s disease.  Born  in Los Angeles, as Alfonso Joseph  Lotito, he  took Floyd as his religious name  when he entered  the Franciscan Order  in  1953, prior to being ordained into the priesthood seven years later. He received his Bachelor of Sacred Theology  from Old Mission  Theological Seminary  in Santa Barbara and  his Masters  in Speech and Communication  Arts from Marquette University.  Before joining the St. Anthony Foundation in  1968, Father Floyd spent  time as a high  school teacher in Santa Barbara and as a parish priest in communities all across our country.  When I think of Father Floyd, I remember a  man who knew everyone’s name, yet called  us all  ‘‘brother’’ or  ‘‘sister’’ as a sign of respect. He went out of his way to make people  feel special and was known locally for his annual Blessing of the Taxi Fleet and the Blessing of the Animals.  Father Floyd’s wisdom and eloquence garnered him invitations to give the benediction at  the 1984 Democratic National Convention  in  San Francisco,  the opening of Pacific Bell  Park in 2000, and many others.  The St. Anthony Foundation has ministered  to  the poor and down-on-their-luck  for more  than 40 years,  in  large part due  to Father  Floyd’s ability to reach people of all types in  profoundly personal ways. He did not see rich  or poor, he only saw  those who could help  and those who needed help.  Father Floyd held many positions at St. Anthony’s, but nearest to his heart was the St.  Anthony Dining Room. Opened in 1981, it is  now the leading free-meal program in the city,  providing more than 2,500 meals a day to San  Francisco’s poor. Earlier  this  year, Father  Floyd served his 35 millionth meal.  Madam Speaker, our community is fortunate  to have been blessed with Father Floyd. He  leaves our community better than he found it  and  it brightens my heart  to know  that San  Francisco has yet another angel to help guide  us.  f  A TRIBUTE HONORING THE  FALKENTHAL-NICHOLS WEDDING  HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 31, 2009  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I  rise today to extend my best wishes to two  young Americans who are starting their new  life  together. On  Friday,  June  4,  2009,  Michelle Lynn Falkenthal and Michael David  Nichols were joined in matrimony surrounded  by their loving family and friends at the Earl  Burns Miller Japanese Garden located on the  campus of California State University, Long  Beach.  Michelle Falkenthal was born in West Covina, California on December 24, 1979. Her  mother, Evelyn Bobbitt, is an accounting technician for the County of San Bernardino, and  her step-father, David Bobbitt, is a director of  audits for Riverside Community College. Her  father is Robert Falkenthal, an attorney in private practice, and her step-mother is Jennette  Falkenthal, a homemaker. Michelle graduated  from Colton high school and is currently employed as a billing agent for Cox Communications.  Michael Nichols was born in Arcadia, California on December 12, 1980. His mother,  Linda Nichols, is a secretary at Arcadia High  School, and his father, Ken Nichols, is a general contractor. Michael attended Arcadia High  School and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. He is employed as  an independent contractor pilot.  In  this constantly developing age of electronic communications, it’s no surprise that the  young couple first met via the internet. After  several weeks of getting acquainted online,  Michelle and Michael had  their  first date on  June 5, 2007. They were engaged  fifteen  months  later on September 14, 2008. The  couple enjoys spending time with family and  friends, going to Big Bear Lake, bike riding,  and remodeling their new home, among other  activities. Their many friends say Michelle and  Michael are very well suited  for each other,  and  their  families already consider each of  them a member of the family. The newlywed  couple will make  their home  in  the city of  Chino Hills in Los Angeles County.  Michelle and Michael were  joined  in  their  wedding celebration in Long Beach by guests  from across  town and across  the country.  Family and  friends  traveled  from Maryland,  Washington,  DC,  Sacramento,  Oxnard,  Newberry Park, the Inland Empire, and from  across  southern California. Special  participants in the wedding ceremony included the  maid of honor Casandra Holiday, the bridesmaids, Sally Lara and Evie Bobbitt, the bride’s  niece  and  sister  respectively,  and  the  groomsmen Travis Amezcua, Ryan Benigno,  Caleb Gray, and Dustin Mullins. Leading the  bridal party and assembled family and guests  in the wedding celebration and officiating the  vows was the Reverend Doctor Paul Yestebo  of the New Hope Community Church in Huntington Beach.  Madam Speaker, I offer my best congratulations  to  the Bobbitt, Falkenthal, and Nichols  families, and their friends and guests on this  happy and memorable occasion. To Michelle  and Michael,  I offer  the sentiment and gifts  which George Bailey offered the Martini family  as  they moved  into  their new home  in  the  classic  film,  ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life’’:  ‘‘Bread!  That  their house may never know hunger.  Salt! That  life may always have  flavor. And  wine! That joy and prosperity may reign forever.’’ Lastly, I wish that throughout their wonderful life together, Michelle and Michael will  always have an abundance of what St. Paul  wrote of in his letter to the Corinthians, ‘‘faith,  hope, and love; and the greatest of these is  love.’’  f  FOOD SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT  OF 2009  SPEECHOF  HON.

379,House,111,-0.226,29,2009-09-08,Mr. EDWARDS of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I consider myself blessed to  have known Congressman Bill Hefner.  He was a good, decent and caring person, and I will miss him dearly. While  this man of faith has gone on to a better place now, his work here on Earth  will continue to enrich the lives of millions of American citizens. There are  untold  thousands of our  troops and  families who are living in better housing today because Bill Hefner was their  champion. He not only worked hard for  his beloved Fort Bragg, North Carolina; he fought for a better quality of  life  for servicemen and  -women and  their families wherever they might live  in the world. As chairman of the House  Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Chairman Hefner  saw to it that the service and sacrifice  of our troops would be honored in a  meaningful way.  While Members of Congress  sometimes take ourselves too seriously, Bill  Hefner was a voice of self-deprecating  humor and humility. He took his work  seriously, but never himself too seriously. In doing so, he helped us keep  our proper perspective on ourselves and  our work here. He used to joke that he  had worked hard for over 20 years to  take a perfectly safe Democratic seat  in North Carolina and turn it into a  marginal one. That was a reflection of  his humor and his humility, because  the truth was that any political challenges that Bill Hefner might have ever  faced were because he was a person of  courage.  As Mr. OBEYpointed out, in 1981 he  was one of  the very  few Southern  Democrats who voted against the popular Reagan tax cuts because he felt  they would lead to large Federal deficits and ultimately undermine programs important to everyday working  Americans. As long as I knew him, he  always did what he thought was right  for his district, for our great country  and for average working families.  In an age of special interests, Bill  Hefner’s cause was to fight for the interests of everyday, hardworking families, the kind of people who fight our  fires, protect our streets, defend our  shores, educate our children and make  our factories run. He believed to his  core in the dignity of hardworking everyday American citizens.  Even after he retired from Congress,  Bill would often call me, and he called  when he was concerned that the views  of working Americans were not being  considered in Washington, D.C. Whether in office or out of office, Bill Hefner  lived his  faith by always being his  brother’s keeper.  Bill Hefner was a special personal  friend and a mentor to me. While I cannot fill his shoes or come close to it,  I’m a better Congressman and a better  person for having known him and having  learned  from him. I cherish the  many, many personal conversations we  had right here on the  floor, Madam  Speaker. I will always be grateful to  the very sage advice he gave me on a  golf course one day when he and I happened to be partnered against then-  President Clinton and the President’s  partner, when on the 15th hole in a  very close match, the President had  about a 31⁄2-foot putt. I was not going  to give it to the President, and Chairman Hefner called me over and put me  under his arm and said, Son, let me  just tell you something. Right now we  have this line item veto in existence,  and the Military Construction bill is  sitting on the President’s desk for signature, and you represent Fort Hood. I  gave the President his putt, and the  Fort Hood soldiers got their barracks  thanks to the sage advice of Bill Hefner.  The moment of so many wonderful  moments, but the moment I shall never  forget, was on June 4 of 1998 when Bill  Hefner stood in this very same spot. We  were debating an issue of the school  prayer constitutional amendment. And  I, consistent with my belief in the constitutional principle of church-State  separation, was opposing  the  Istook  constitutional  amendment.  During  that process I was personally attacked  by one particular  faith-based group  that claimed by not wanting to amend  the First Amendment to the Constitution I was somehow un-American and  even worse yet, I was accused of being  un-Texan. Leave it to Bill Hefner, the  man of the South, the gentleman from  North Carolina who sang gospel music  his entire life, a man of deep faith,  leave it to him to come to this very  spot to stand up and defend the integrity of his colleague who had been challenged. That was Bill Hefner, a man of  deepest integrity. And that is why I  will always revere him and what he  stood for.  To Stacye and Shelly, his daughters,  and to Nancy, his widow, I would simply say that if my two sons had every  right to be half as proud of me as you  have a right to be proud of your father  and your husband, I would consider my  life a success.  May God forever keep our friend, our  colleague, and a great American, Bill  Hefner,  forever  in His  loving arms.  Thank you.  ",2009
380,House,111,-0.404,43,2009-09-08,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," I want to say two  things and then I will be done for the  night, too.  There was this interesting article in  Newsweek this week. It was about a  book about William F. Buckley and  about the battle between the extreme  right wing of the Republican Party and  the William F. Buckley National Review kind of wing, and there was this  little battle post-New Deal.  But it’s interesting to note that right  after Roosevelt got in, there was this  extreme reaction, very similar to what  we’re seeing where every critique of  what Roosevelt was doing was socialism, communism, and all of these fancy  names. But there were also these vigilante minutemen who would show up  at these events carrying their guns,  and it was amazing, because that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here.  There’s no solution. There are just  these critiques of how the train is moving down the track. The American people want to go in another direction.  But I wanted to share this story because I think this is what we’re all  talking about.  I ran into this woman at the Canfield  Fair. I stood outside the Democratic  Party tent. This is one of the biggest  fairs in Ohio over Labor Day. I stood  there for 4 hours, 4 hours, just south of  Youngstown, Ohio. I had two people  out of all the entire time come up to  me and say, What are you doing with  this socialist—and they’re also against  the energy bill, so it was totally the  right wing talk radio crowd that was  like inundating them with this stuff.  Two people came up against this.  But what this one woman said, she’s  35 years old, married, kid. Husband just  lost a job. They made about $58,000 a  year when he worked.

All of us who just went back  to our home States realize there are a  lot of people who are truly hurting out  there. It is not just people who have already lost their jobs, but there are a  lot of people who are afraid they are  going to lose their jobs.  There are people who are afraid to invest to create jobs. I would say the  number one emotion I heard during the  August recess was that of fear. It is  fear of what is going to happen in this  country. I think Senator DORGANeloquently put it that this bill is about  jobs. It is about creating jobs without  adding to the Federal debt.  Another thing I heard throughout the  State of Nevada is that people are very  concerned about Federal spending and  the deficits this year we are facing.

Former  Anchorage  Assemblyman  Allan Tesche passed away July 14, 2009,  after complications  from heart  surgery.  Allan Tesche was the embodiment of  a true Alaskan and an incredible public  servant. While I was mayor of Anchorage, Allan  served on  the Assembly.  During this time, I got to know Allan  and his family well. He was committed  to the residents of Anchorage, and his  dedication to making our city a better  place was second to none. He and his  wife Pam were active members of the  community and raised their two children in Anchorage.  On behalf of his family, many friends,  and colleagues, I ask today we honor  Allan Tesche’s memory. I ask his obituary, published July 26, 2009, in the Anchorage Daily News, be printed in the  RECORD.

A memorial service will  be at 2 p.m. Monday at Central Lutheran  Church. Allan was born Aug.  3,  1948,  to  Marilyn and Frederick Rutledge Tesche in  Los Alamos, N.M. He graduated with honors  from the University of California at Davis in  1970. In the Peace Corps, he spent two years  in El Salvador supporting Community Development projects. Upon his return, he enrolled in law school at the University of California at Davis, where he was an honorary  member of The Chicano Law Students Association. In his second year he was recruited  by the Greater Anchorage Area Borough to  serve a six-month internship in the Anchorage Borough Attorney’s Office; thus began  his  long association with Alaska government. Allan was invited by Mayor Jack Roderick to return after graduation as a staff attorney. Allan’s work on borough-city unification in 1975–76 led Mayor George Sullivan  to elevate him to deputy municipal attorney,  a position he held until his appointment to  lead the Mat-Su Borough Legal Department  in 1980.

For years, Dick Johnson was regarded as a  role model in the business community of eastern Indiana. Dick will be remembered for his  willingness to share in his successes with others; he will undoubtedly be missed by his  wonderful  family, but also all  those whose  lives he touched.  Dick Johnson was born on November 25,  1932 in Fort Wayne, Indiana to Samuel Gideon and Jessie Loomis Johnson. Dick spent  his youth  in Fort Wayne before graduating  from the Indiana University School of Business  in 1955.  At IU, Dick showed the promise of a young  man committed to honesty and integrity that  would be  fulfilled each day of his  life. Dick  earned the nickname ‘‘honest Abe’’ and was  elected president of his fraternity, Sigma Alpha  Epsilon.  Dick also demonstrated his love for country,  completing ROTC  training and serving as a  Lieutenant in the U.S. Army from 1955–1957.  Dick began his business career  in 1957  when he purchased a Shell Oil distributorship  which would become  the Johnson Oil Company. Dick’s business acumen was evident as  the company grew and diversified under his  leadership.  In 1981, Johnson Oil Company opened its  first convenience store  in Nashville,  Indiana.  Now  the Bigfoot Food Store chain operates  more than 200 locations in Indiana, Kentucky,  and Illinois.  Dick was often recognized for his leadership  in the business community, serving as President of the Indiana Oil Marketers Association  and on  the National Distributor Council  for  Shell Oil. He was also honored as the 1988  Columbus Small Business Person of the Year,  the 1994  IU Distinguished Entrepreneur and  the 2000 Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the  Year.  Dick Johnson will always be remembered  for what he accomplished  in  the business  world, but those closest to him also know of  a kind-hearted man with a commitment to his  community.  He chaired the Columbus Front Door Committee and served as the president of many  organizations over the years including the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, the Heritage  Fund of Bartholomew County, the Columbus  Economic Development Board, and  the Columbus Regional Hospital Foundation.  Dick and his beloved wife Ruth were also  significant philanthropists, donating to causes  such as the Columbus Area Arts Council and  the Columbus Senior Citizens Center.  As a proud graduate of Indiana University,  Dick was so very proud of his founding sponsorship of  the Johnson Center  for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Kelley School  of Business.  I first came to know Dick Johnson as a respected competitor of my father in the business world. Then, as now, Dick Johnson was  admired for his devotion to his faith, his family,  his business acumen and his unblemished  reputation for integrity.  Dick Johnson was a public man who saw  business as a means to improve his community, his state, his university and his nation.  To his loving wife Ruth, his children and entire family I offer my deepest condolences and  prayer  that  they may be comforted with  faith we share.  Columbus and Indiana have lost a giant and  I have lost a cherished mentor and friend.  the  f  HONORING KENNETH TAYLOR  HON.

387,,111,0.484,106,2009-09-08,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  to honor  the  life of Kenneth  ‘‘Kenny’’  Taylor upon being named by the Madera District Chamber of Commerce as a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award, Memorial Honoree.  The  life of Mr. Taylor will be honored on  Wednesday, August 26, 2009 at the Fifth Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards and Installation Dinner.  Mr. Kenny Taylor was born at Dearborn  Hospital in Madera, California, to Minnie and  Marie Taylor. He graduated from Madera High  School in 1968. He attended Fresno City College, and in 1970 joined the family business,  Taylor Insurance; he later bought the company  from his father. Throughout his career he was  a trusted and respected professional. Mr. Taylor  treated his business and customers with  unquestionable integrity.  Mr. Taylor was proud of his community and  Madera High School. He was a member of  Saint Joachim’s Church, the 20/30 Club, Exchange Club, Kiwanis Club, Madera Babe  Ruth, Madera Elks  Lodge, Fresno/Madera  Basque Club, and Madera Golf and Country  Club. While active with  the Exchange Club,  Mr. Taylor created  the  ‘‘Boy of  the Month  Award’’  to recognize  the all-around achievement  of  senior  high  school  students  in  Madera. When the Exchange Club closed its  doors, Mr. Taylor joined the Kiwanis Club and  brought  the award with him; he  funded  the  program out of his own pocket. He attended  as many Madera High sporting events as possible; he coached baseball and played golf.  Once, Mr. Taylor attended a Madera High  cross country meet and realized many of the  athletes did not have proper shoes. Without a  word, or attention brought  to  the situation,  those athletes had new shoes provided  to  them at no cost. That was the kind of person  he was.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  posthumously honor the life of Kenny Taylor upon  being named the Madera Chamber of Commerce 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award Memorial Honoree. I invite my colleagues to join  me in honoring Mr. Taylor’s life and best wishes for his family.  f  TRIBUTE TO WEST MORGAN HIGH  SCHOOL  HON.

From humble beginnings  in 1950, Pastor  L.H. Hardwick has  led, nurtured, and grown  this fine congregation into one of Nashville’s  leading churches. With over 3500 members,  Christ Church impacts the entire Middle Tennessee region through its wide array of community involvement. One small example is the  church’s activity center, which includes fitness  facilities and an  indoor playground. Rather  than restricting access to the church’s members, the activity center is open to both friends  and neighbors to utilize.  I am awed by  the personal commitment  Pastor Hardwick has demonstrated  through  his service to Christ Church. When one considers the many changes that have occurred  in our country over the past sixty years, Pastor  Hardwick’s continuous service is real inspiration.  Please  join me  in honoring 60 years of  Christ Church’s past, and celebrating the next  60 years of Christ Church’s future.  f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  JAMES C. VAN ANTWERP, JR.  HON.

389,House,111,0.554,4,2009-09-15,Mr. STEARNS.," Madam Speaker, one  year ago yesterday, a major  investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared  bankruptcy, a move which sent the  Dow Jones tumbling 500 points and  simply  led to a chain of events  in  which the Federal Government nationalized AIG with a $189 billion bailout.  The American  auto  industry  asked  Congress to authorize help, hundreds of  billions of dollars, to bail out them.  Banks did the same thing. Private institutions across this country asked for  support.  Today, just 1 year later, our Federal  Government is in control of practically  every sector of our economy, having  spent almost $800 billion or 5 percent of  our GDP on a stimulus package that  was pork-laden and is still working to  create  jobs and boost this economy.  And, most  alarmingly, nothing has  been done to cure the culture of bailouts that our government, with the  help of the Federal Reserve, has continued  to  perpetuate. Bailout  after  bailout is not a strategy for economic  recovery.  My colleagues, we are at a critical  point in our Nation’s economic history.  Financial regulatory reform proposals  are being discussed here in Congress  and across this country. We all agree  that reform is certainly needed, but,  unfortunately, the plan put forth by  the Obama administration is not the  kind of reform that will put an end to  this culture of bailouts, nor will  it  bring transparency to the opaque and  ever, ever expanding Federal Reserve.  In fact, it does just the opposite.  In June of this year, Treasury Secretary Geithner unveiled the administration’s plan for financial regulatory  reform, and the cornerstone of the proposal is centered on ceding vast new  powers to the Federal Reserve as a  means of preventing  future  financial  crises. But this overreliance on the  Federal Reserve is unwise.  History shows us that in times the  Fed saved us from one crisis, it inadvertently  instigated another one.  In  1913 when the Fed was founded, it was  intentionally set up to serve as an institution that could help cushion the  blow when banking crises occurred.  However, the problem with an institution that is designed to insulate banks  from the consequences of their own  poor  investment decisions  is that  it  also  inadvertently  encourages  these  same banks  to keep  taking unwise  risks, thereby laying the groundwork  for a vicious cycle of bailout after bailout.  In fact, every time there is a potential financial crisis, the Federal Open  Market Committee quickly cuts short-  term interest rates. These cuts have  become larger over time, as evidenced  by our current zero percent interest  rates. And, more  importantly, these  cuts essentially function as a bailout  to those banks that have run into financial problems. Banks know  they  can count on the Fed to lower interest  rates during times of financial distress,  and markets know the Fed is always  prepared to provide loose credit to financiers facing big losses.  Now, what  lessons have the banks  learned from the financial crisis? The  truth is that if they get into trouble,  the Fed will be there to lend unlimited  amounts of money at extremely low interests rates. So where is the motivation then for curbing risky investment  behavioral by these banks? The only  one on the proverbial financial hook  under a current Federal bailout system  is you, the taxpayer.  Yesterday, President Obama gave a  speech on financial reform at Federal  Hall on Wall Street. Ironically, Federal  Hall is where the founders of our great  Nation once bitterly argued over how  much the government should control  the national economy.  In his speech, the President warned  Wall Street that they shouldn’t ignore  the lessons from the past financial and  current financial crisis. They shouldn’t  become complacent and expect future  bailouts. Yet the financial regulatory  reform, the plan the President’s administration is putting forth, calls for expanding the powers of the Federal Reserve, and the Fed is essentially a bailout machine for the financial sector.  Clearly there is a discrepancy between  the President’s rhetoric and the reality  of the policies.  In 55 B.C., the great Roman statesman Cicero wisely said, ‘‘The budget  should be balanced, the treasury should  be refilled, public debt should be reduced,  the arrogance of officialdom  should be tempered and controlled, and  assistance to foreign lands should be  curtailed,  lest Rome  become  bankrupt.’’  My colleagues, looking back on the  one-year anniversary of the Lehman  Brothers bankruptcy, we would do well  to heed Cicero’s advice and seek out financial reform policies that will steer  us away from the practice of bailouts  and the policies that will bankrupt future generations. My colleagues, America is too great a country to not learn  from its past mistakes.  f  RECESS  ",2009

Our country has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated Marines  who willingly and unselfishly risk their lives to  keep our country safe.  We recognize Vernon R. Buss for his meritorious actions on the Guiana Airstrip, Samar  Island, Republic of the Philippines on the 24  January 1945, while  serving as a ground  maintenance mechanic, aircraft wing. On this  day while performing maintenance duties  in  connection with operation against Japanese  forces  in  the Philippines, Corporal Vernon  Robert Buss, United States Marine, put the life  of another Marine over his own. While assisting in the rescue attempt of a crashed aircraft  and  its crew, Corporal Buss singlehandedly  extracted the unconscious and burning body  of Staff Sergeant  Irving Saunders  from  the  wreckage of a burning F4–U Corsair. With  total disregard  for his own safety, Corporal  Buss rushed to the side of Staff Sergeant Irving Saunders and carried him away from the  burning aircraft, the burning pools of gasoline,  and the random detonation of .50 caliber ammunition as it ‘‘cooked off’’ from the Corsair’s  burning ammunition  supply. Corporal Buss  carried Staff Sergeant Saunders to safety, rendered first aid to him, and facilitated his evacuation to a hospital where he was treated for  life threatening third degree burns over an estimated forty percent of his body. We recognize Corporal Vernon Robert Buss for his fearless personal initiative, professional dedication  and sagacious bravery on 24 January 1945.  His actions reflect the meritorious credit upon  his person and were in keeping with the highest  traditions of  the Marine Corps and  the  United States Naval Service.  On behalf of  the people of  the United  States, Congressman DARRELLE. ISSA, Major  General Michael R.

400,House,111,0.581,19,2009-09-24,Mr. DEAL of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  Congress recessed on July 31 for the beginning of the August recess. On that  day, H.R. 3200 passed out of the committees that had jurisdiction. That is  the health care reform bill. It passed  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I serve, late on that  Friday evening, the last day in July.  And  everybody  in  this House went  home for the August recess.  During that period of time, I held  town hall meetings, as did many of my  colleagues. There were TEA parties.  There were freedom rallies. The American public spoke out as they have not  done in a very long time and much of  their frustration centered around the  bill H.R. 3200 that at that point in time  had passed all of the committees of the  House and was ready for action on the  floor.  But the American public sent a message, a message that they don’t like  the runaway spending that Congress  has been engaged in. They don’t like  many of the programs that they think  are  jeopardizing  the  future of  their  children and grandchildren in terms of  the  repayment  responsibilities. But  more than anything else, they sent the  message that they do not want their  health care tampered with and taken  over by the United States Government.  Now, surprisingly, that message apparently has not been heard on the  floor of this House.  Yesterday in the committee of primary jurisdiction that has H.R. 3200,  the bill was, in effect, reopened for further  amendments. Now,  you would  think that if the bill is going to be revisited that we would have heard not  only from the American people but we  would have heard from the President of  the United States, who on September 9  spoke right here on the floor of the  House. At  the  time he  enunciated  issues that he was in favor of. Republicans  agreed with many  of  those  things. But the question we had at the  time was, where is the bill that embodies the things that you say you’re  in favor of? We did not see a bill then,  and, unfortunately, we have not seen  one since that time.  So yesterday in the committee of primary  jurisdiction, you would  think  that we would have seen a bill that embraced the principles that the President  said he was  in  favor of even  though they were not embraced in the  bill that was the only bill before this  House when the President was actually  speaking. You would think  it would  have embraced many of the issues that  the American public said they were  concerned about.  Republicans attempted to offer a bill  that would have embraced those issues  where there should be bipartisan support, but we were not allowed to have  a vote.  There are many issues that are encompassed in this debate. One that I  have supported for a very long time is  that if we are going to use taxpayer  money, we should verify the citizenship  of individuals who are going to receive  the benefits of that taxpayer money because unless that is verified, there is  no validity to simply saying that we  are  not  going  to  spend  taxpayers’  money  for people who have violated  our law and are coming into our country inappropriately.  So the question remains, Where are  we on health care reform? The rumors  now abound that Speaker PELOSI is  about to introduce a bill that purports  to address the issues she’s concerned  with. We haven’t seen the bill. I would  ask the question, Is that bill going to  come before the committees of jurisdiction? Is there going to be a hearing  on it? Are committees going to have  the opportunity to amend it? Or is it  going to go, as so many other things  have gone in this body during these  last few months, straight to the floor  of this House with very little, if any,  opportunity to have an input from the  Representatives, who are the elected  representatives of the people of this  great country?  Those are the questions that still remain. They are still unanswered.  I would conclude, again, if there is  something that we have gained from  what we have heard from the President  and, more particularly, what we have  heard from the American public during  the August recess, where  is the bill  that puts it in writing?

403,Senate,111,0.391,138,2009-09-24,Mr. JOHANNS.," Mr. President, Steve  and Shelley Brune are extraordinary  Nebraskans who made a commitment  to open their hearts and home to a foster child, which led to a remarkable  story of love and compassion.  In September  1999,  they welcomed  Jonathon into their home as a foster  child. In February 2001, Jonathon’s biological brother, James, was also removed from the home. The Brune family recognized the importance of keeping  siblings  together and agreed  to  unite the brothers by welcoming James  into  their home as a  second  foster  child.  The Brunes worked closely with the  Nebraska Department of Health and  Human Services, HHS, in efforts to reunite Jonathon and James with their  biological parents. When HHS determined that reunification was not in the  boys’ best interest, Steve and Shelley  made a permanent commitment to the  boys by adopting them; Jonathon on  July 19, 2001 and James on January 17,  2002.  In October 2007, the biological sister  of James and Jonathon, Mary Ann, was  removed  from  the home. HHS contacted the Brune family to discuss the  possibility of once again becoming foster  parents. The Brunes  recognized  that this child needed a loving home  and would benefit from being with her  brothers. For a third time, they admirably opened their hearts and home,  welcoming Mary Ann on July 15, 2008.  In April 2009, another sibling, Madeline Grace, was born and was also removed from the home. The Brune family showed tremendous compassion and  devotion to the children of this family  by  agreeing  to  welcome Madeline  Grace  into  their  family. Steve and  Shelley are currently in the process of  adopting both Mary Ann and Madeline  Grace.  It is with heartfelt admiration that I  nominate Steve and Shelley Brune as  Adoption Angels. Their  capacity  to  love and care for these four children is  an inspiration and worthy example for  others to follow. My hope is that their  story inspires others to consider opening  their hearts and homes  to  the  many children awaiting adoption,  in  need of loving families.  May God bless Shelley, Steve, Jonathan,  James, Mary Ann, Madeline  Grace, and all adoptive parents who  give children the gift of a loving family.∑  f  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  BRICKLAYERS  AND ALLIED CRAFT WORKERS  ∑",2009

The Chair will entertain up to 15 further requests for 1-  minute speeches on each side of the  aisle.  HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM  (Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2009
408,,111,-0.349,1,2009-10-07,Mr. BACA.," Reforming health insurance must be our duty and responsibility. The vast majority of Americans  have health insurance. The question is  what does our health insurance reform  mean for them.  It means that insurance companies  no longer will decide to deny your coverage or jack up your insurance rate  because of preexisting conditions.  It means that it will be against the  law for insurance companies to drop  your coverage when you get sick or  water it down when you need it the  most.  It means that there will be a yearly  limit on how much you can be charged  for out-of-pocket expenses, because no  one should go broke because they get  sick.  It means that premiums will stop  growing three times faster than your  wages, because more competitiveness  in  insurance markets will hold premiums down.  It means that if you lose your job or  change your job, you’ll be able to get  affordable coverage.  In short, what health insurance reform means for millions of Americans  who are insured today is more security  and stability. Americans should not  have to wait longer for this reform.  Congress must act this year.  f  CONGRATULATING THE CENTER  FOR DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS  (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and  was given permission to address the  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

And I, too, thank you for all of  your help and your input with regard  to the issue of Chinese poultry. It was  a long discussion, but one in which I  think we came to a conclusion as our  colleague, Mr. DAVIS, said being able to  strike that balance where we are able  to protect the public health and at the  same time to protect an industry. And  I feel good about that.  And I, too, look forward to our continued efforts together as we approach  problems—as you know and I do—that  really face people with the jurisdiction  that we have that comes under this  portfolio.  It  really  touches people’s  lives in so, so many ways. And I know  that you have a deep and abiding concern for what happens to our farmers  and our ranchers, what’s happening to  our industries and to making sure that  we have the wherewithal and provide  the resources people need to succeed.  I would like to, if I might, just make  one further comment, and then we’ll  yield back whatever time is remaining.  I wanted to bring the attention of my  colleagues to an important matter of  health and safety. And when we talked  about the child nutrition program and  its  extension,  our Nation’s  schoolchildren and the people who work with  them on a daily basis are faced with a  growing public health concern. Awareness of vaccine for H1N1 flu, annual flu  has made the front pages of our communities these days.  You’ve got school food service workers who face a very difficult dilemma  in trying to do their jobs. They don’t  have any paid sick leave. These are  people without any leave. So there’s  thousands of food service workers who  pose a real risk to the health and safety of our Nation’s kids. And the comment is ‘‘show up for work or do not  get paid.’’  So  rather  than  exacerbating  the  problems,  these  workers  can  and  should be part of the solution to ensuring the health and safety of our children. I look forward to working in the  months ahead as Education and Labor  looks to reauthorize their legislation,  and I pledge to work with my colleagues to see if we can provide a minimum and a reasonable standard for  paid sick leave for school service workers.  In the meantime, I am also encouraging the administration to examine  this issue because I think it is a health  problem and the Nation’s well-being  depends on it.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  support of the FY 2010 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration  Appropriations Conference Report, and I commend Chairwoman DELAURO for bringing this  bipartisan legislation to the floor today.  The FY 2010 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration Appropriations bill makes key investments in protecting our public health, bolstering food nutrition programs, and conserving our natural resources.  The conference report provides $2.36 billion  for the Food and Drug Administration, which  represents a 15 percent  increase over  last  year. We need to ensure that the FDA has the  necessary tools and resources to fulfill its vital  mission in protecting the American public so  that FDA-regulated products,  like  food, are  safe. This important investment in the FDA will  help the agency in meeting its mission in protecting the public health.  The $58 billion provided  for  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will help  low income and elderly Americans struggling  with rising food costs in this current economic  downturn. In addition, $7.3 billion is provided  for  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC,  to help encourage a healthy pregnancy  for  women and promote a healthy start for their  children.  This  legislation provides $1 billion  for  the  Natural Resources Conservation Service  to  help face the demands for cleaner water, reduced soil erosion, and more wildlife habitat. I  am particularly pleased that almost $4 million  is provided  for Chesapeake Bay  restoration  activities that will provide farmers, landowners,  and communities within the Chesapeake Bay  watershed  technical  assistance  in  implementing  important  conservation  programs  the  this conthe health of  which will help  improve  Chesapeake Bay.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge adoption of  ference report.  ",2009
414,House,111,-0.302,575,2009-10-07,Ms. BERKLEY.," Thank you, Congresswoman.  woman DEBBIEWASSERMAN SCHULTZ  I would like to thank both Congressand my dear friend Congressman SUE  MYRICK for leading the charge, and a  special thank you to DEBBIE. She did  mention that we’re next-door neighbors.  And I want to tell you, DEBBIE, I used  to—you know, in the morning before I  start getting ready to come to work—  and I am always at work by 8 o’clock  no matter where I have to be; it’s usually by 8. And I would be sitting at my  dining room table having my cup of  coffee and reading the newspaper, and  at ungodly hours there was DEBBIEgetting into her car, and I couldn’t for the  life of me figure out where she was  going at this hour. I said, Where can  this woman be going?  But then by 8 o’clock I would see her  at whatever meeting we were at. And I  never knew until you made that public  disclosure  of what you were  going  through  and  that  you were  going  through it by yourself, with your loved  ones, but not sharing with your colleagues because you wanted to keep  this personal and not tell people at  that time. And I cannot tell you the  admiration I had for you long before  that, but particularly afterwards.  And, SUE, same thing. I recall distinctly when you were going through  your treatments and how brave you  were during that time, and it’s an inspiration for all of us.  This is a very important piece of legislation, and that’s why I came to the  floor at 9 o’clock in the evening. It’s  particularly personal to me.  There isn’t a woman in my family  that has not died of cancer, of breast  cancer: both my grandmothers, all of  my aunts, my mother. The worst day of  my life is when my sister, Wendy, 47 at  the time, called me up and told me  that she had been diagnosed with cancer. Given the background of my family, listening to this my knees buckled  because I was so fearful of her fate. But  because times have changed and there’s  early detection and better awareness of  this dreaded, horrible disease, horrible  disease, she was able to get the treatment that she needed. They practically  killed her to cure her, but she’s alive  today and doing not only very well but  she  just became a grandmother  last  Friday. And that could not have happened in my mother’s generation or my  grandmothers’  because  they weren’t  aware of what they needed to do in  order to protect themselves.  I am hoping that when we are discussing health care  in this country  that we are able to change the paradigm of how we deliver health care  services to the people that we represent throughout the United States of  America. This is a perfect example of  legislation that is important because it  raises awareness for all women, young  and  old,  but  particularly  younger  women that need to know what to look  for, what to expect, what are the signs,  and what they can do when they suspect that they have the early signs of  cancer.

441,Senate,111,0.496,596,2009-10-07,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I wish  to thank my colleague from Tennessee  for speaking so eloquently and raising  the issues that are on the minds not  just of Senators who are going to have  to vote on this legislation but our constituents all across America—people  who will be directly affected by what  we do here on health care reform.  Yesterday, I came to the floor and I  asked the question: Will we have a  transparent  debate?  This morning,  when I got up and checked my e-mail,  I was delighted to see that eight Democratic Senators have written to the  majority leader, Senator REID, and said  they wanted to have bill language posted on the Internet and a score or cost  by the Congressional Budget Office at  least 72 hours before we are required to  vote on the bill. That is exactly what  we had requested in the Finance Committee, which we  lost strictly on a  party-line vote, an amendment that  would have made that part of the bill.  So I consider that progress. I am delighted that these eight Democratic  Senators have asked the majority leader for that. I think that is a minimum  we should expect  in terms of transparency.

We will hopefully be joined here on the  floor by some other Members who are  just as interested in reform this afternoon.  Let me start out by saying that this  really  should be a bipartisan  issue.  Health care reform, which touches individuals no matter whether they are a  Republican or a Democrat, whether  they are a liberal or a conservative,  should be a bipartisan issue. We should  be sitting here working together to try  to pass reform. Because when it comes  down to it, there is, I think, broad bipartisan agreement, both in this House  and out in the public, about what the  problems are out there.  We have too many people that are  playing by the rules, doing everything  we ask, getting  the  job, being employed, putting food on their table for  their family and their kids but they  can’t get health care insurance. Five  out of six of the uninsured in this country are part of a family that have at  least one full-time worker.  We agree that it doesn’t make sense  that there are so many people who are  doing everything we ask and simply  can’t afford to have health care insurance. We also agree that  it doesn’t  make too much sense that doctors have  seen a lot of the joy be taken out of the  practice of medicine as  they  spend  more and more of their time filling out  paperwork, hiring claims managers and  fighting with insurance companies.  b1500  We need to get physicians back to  the practice of medicine and get the  VerDate Nov 24 2008  05:09 Jan 16, 2010 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00148 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD09\RECFILES\H28OC9.REC H28OC9 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 9 6 K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2009
448,Senate,111,-0.325,190,2009-10-28,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  have come to talk specifically about  the urgency of passing the unemployment benefit extension.  I want to take a moment to respond  to my friend from Oklahoma, who was  essentially bashing the Government’s  ability to provide any kind of structure  or opportunity for health care, saying  that the Federal Government cannot  be trusted to provide access to health  care for people. I suggest that the 40  million people who receive their health  care  through Medicare—seniors over  age 65 and people with disabilities—  would probably disagree with that. I  think my  83-year-old mother would  wrestle me to the ground if I tried to  take away her Medicare card. She has  access to choose her own doctor and  procedures.  This is a system that involves the  public and private sectors, and it was  in fact established in 1965 by the U.S.  Government to make sure seniors and  people with disability have health care.  Also, those who are poor in this country and have lost their jobs and are  fearful of losing their health care, families, and low-income seniors who need  to go into nursing homes would probably disagree with my  friends  from  Oklahoma about Medicaid, even though  there are many challenges  that we  need to work on in terms of rates and  so on.  Medicaid is a safety net for many  Americans. That is the difference, in  some  cases,  for  seniors  in nursing  homes between life and death.  I am proud the Federal Government  also stepped up on Medicaid. I also  think the Children’s Health Insurance  Program, which was  started  in  the  nineties for low-income working families to make sure that if someone is  working in a job and does not have  health insurance, at least their children can be taken care of with a low-  cost policy they pay for. But we established and created a way for families to  get health  insurance.  I  think  those  folks would probably disagree with the  statement as well.  In many regards, the VA—and while  there  are  certainly  challenges  and  issues and we all push through to make  sure our constituents are served—has  been in the forefront of health information  technology,  electronic medical  records, and so on. The VA is a system  that works  for  our  veterans  as  it  should. When it is not well funded, as it  has not been in the past with the previous administration, we stepped up to  increase  the  funding  repeatedly  to  make sure our veterans have what they  need through a Federal Government  health care system.  Finally, I will just say, there are our  military and military retirees as well  whom, I am proud to say, our country  has  supported  through  providing  a  health care system.  We can talk more about health care  at another time. But I do think this  ongoing effort to be critical of anything we do collectively as a country,  through a democratic process of government, that somehow that is bad, I  find that interesting, when we are saying to those around the world they  should go to our system. We, together  through our system, have made sure  there  are  opportunities  for many  Americans, most Americans,  if you  count the employer-based health care  system, the tax credits, the incentives  for employers, the government policy.  In some way, our government has been  involved in incentivizing health care.  The question now is, Do we complete  the job? I am very hopeful we will complete the job for every American and  tackle health care costs that are crippling our businesses, our government,  and our families.  I wish to speak about something else  that is of tremendous urgency for families. I was very pleased that last night,  finally, after 3 weeks of blocking our  ability to get to this bill to extend unemployment benefits, we have the opportunity to get to a vote. Eighty-  seven Members voted to proceed to the  bill. I don’t understand, when 87 Members vote to proceed to the bill, why we  could not have done this sooner.  Since we started to try to get to this  bill, to this point today, 143,000-plus  people have lost their unemployment  insurance benefits—just in the last 3  weeks, over 143,000 people, who have  done nothing but work all their lives,  play by the rules, the job goes away,  they are trying to find another job and,  in the meantime, keep a roof over the  head for their family, food on the table,  turn on that electric, turn on that  heating system, which is going to cost  VerDate Nov 24 2008  23:39 Oct 28, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28OC6.018 S28OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2009

Unless they are involved in boycott or coercion, they can fix prices,  carve up territories, do  innumerable  anticompetitive things that any other  industry in America would have to answer for in a court of law. They get a  pass on it because of the McCarran-  Ferguson Act. But it shows, as the Senator from Illinois is pointing out, how  vitally  important competition  is because that public option, I doubt it is  going to sit down with private insurance industry and fix prices or carve up  territories. It will have a public purpose and a public function, and it will  be serving the people rather than the  shareholders of the insurance company.  ",2009
451,,111,-0.343,253,2009-10-28,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam Speaker,  our brave student servicemembers defending  the United States  in  Iraq, Afghanistan and  other countries abroad are often charged interest on their federal college student loans while  deployed. Because this interest is costly and  unfair, I rise today to introduce the Servicemember Student Loan  Interest Relief Act  to  end the practice.  This legislation builds upon a provision included  in  the Higher Education Opportunity  Act (H.R. 4137) in the 110th Congress, which  prevents interest from accruing on loans originated after October 2008 during activations.  The  provision  provided  important  relief  to  servicemembers who  intended  to  take out  loans in the future, but it did not address those  who currently had student loan debt.  The bill I introduce today corrects that issue  and provides interest relief to all active duty  servicemembers with eligible loans. Our students in uniform could save up to $1,479 during a 12- to 15-month activation under this bill,  according to estimates.  As our servicemembers put  themselves  in  harm’s way, the least we can do is put their  student loans on hold until they return home.  I’m pleased to work with Senator BAYHon this  important issue.  I urge passage of this legislation and yield  back the balance of my time.  f  HONORING THE WORLD WAR II  VETERANS OF ILLINOIS  HON.

453,House,111,-0.408,3,2009-11-05,Mr. WELCH.," Mr. Speaker, America  knows that we live with a health care  contradiction: some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world providing health care to those who have  access to the best health care in the  world, but a health care system that  also shuts the door of access to 47 million Americans with exploding costs,  putting a punishing financial burden  on our middle class and on our businesses that are hanging on to their  health care by their fingernails.  This system has worked very well for  the insurance companies—unregulated,  unsupervised,  and  unapologetic—but  they have plundered the wallets of families and the profits of businesses to  record record profits. That, Mr. Speaker, is the status quo.  On Saturday,  this House of Representatives will face a question that  has eluded it for 60 years: Will we accept the status quo or turn the page  and provide health care to all Americans?  Our health care legislation is going  to do what needs to be done to take  that first step, extend access to 36 million Americans, insurance reforms, and  a public option.  f  WHAT’S IN THE HEALTH CARE  PACKAGE?  (Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and  to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker,  if you want to  know what’s in a package, you ought  to open it up and take a look at it.  Let me  just talk about one thing  that’s in this package we’re going to  vote on on Saturday. It’s in the area of  tort reform, litigation reform, a subject that every single audience  I’ve  spoken  to  in my district has  said  should be in any bill, because right now  the litigation system puts tremendous  strain on our health care system, adding additional trillions of dollars.  What does this program do? It says  that  it’s going to provide an opportunity for pilot projects. But if your  State has on its books a law which says  there will be any limitation on attorneys’ fees or any limitation on damages, including noneconomic damages,  you are ineligible to participate. So my  State of California, which had medical  malpractice reform 30 years ago, will  be ineligible, will be punished.  We’re not talking about the status  quo on litigation reform; we’re talking  about going back 30 years.

We are not worried about safety and security.  Page 1785, a financial and technical  capability of an Indian Tribe, shall be  exempt even if they can’t operate safely a water treatment plant. So what  you are doing in the health care bill,  exempting  Indian  tribes who  don’t  know how to manage a refinery, you  are giving them protections  in this  health care bill. But in this bill, municipal water plants pay more; private  water plants pay more; refineries pay  more. Indian tribes under your health  care bill——  ",2009
458,House,111,0.495,66,2009-11-05,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in opposition to the health care reform bill offered by Speaker PELOSI  and the Democratic leadership, which  we anticipate will be voted on possibly  before the end of this week, and in support of the commonsense, practical alternative offered by Congressman JOHN  BOEHNER, the Republican leader in the  House.  Madam Speaker, this legislation offered by Speaker PELOSI is over 2,000  pages long and contains about 400,000  words. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this government takeover of  the health care system in the United  States, this legislation uses the word  ‘‘shall’’ 3,425 times. When you see the  word ‘‘shall’’ in legislation, you should  read a mandate, a requirement, that  the government is requiring somebody  to do something to comply with what  people here in Washington know best,  not in terms of what people know is  best  for themselves. This  legislation  contains that word 3,425 times. It is  truly a remarkable, complex government takeover.  In the original bill offered earlier  this year, which was 1,000 pages long,  there was the creation of 53 new Federal Government  agencies  and  programs. In the new  improved revised  version, there are now 111 Federal Government agencies and programs contained in this legislation, which will  cost the American taxpayers and our  senior citizens more than $1.1 trillion.  That is the official government estimate. There are many health care experts who say that the implementation  of this  legislation will cost  far,  far  more.  As an example, many have pointed to  the projected cost of Medicare when it  was enacted in 1965. It was projected  that it would cost $10 billion to $12 billion 25 years later; but by the end of  the 1980s, Medicare was actually costing the American taxpayers more than  $100 billion. In fact, today it costs more  than  $400 billion per year; and  the  Speaker’s  proposal  says, well,  let’s  take out of that $400 billion per year.  Let’s take about $40 billion a year, or  10 percent of that, and divert  it to  other new government programs.  Well, Madam Speaker, the problem  with that is that the Medicare program  today  is  faced with enormous challenges. The projected unfunded liability for Medicare over the lifetime of  the average American today is more  than $17 trillion, here at a time when  starting next year senior citizens will  increase in their numbers dramatically  because the baby boomers, those born  in the years after World War II and up  until the early 1960s, will be retiring,  will be  reaching  eligibility age  for  Medicare, and year after year after  year the number of Medicare-eligible  senior citizens will increase dramatically.  At the same time that will be occurring, this Congress is suggesting that it  will be okay to take $400 billion out of  the Medicare program to spend on an  entirely new health care program that  is projected to cost $1.1 trillion over 10  years, and I suggest will cost far more  than that. So Medicare is going to be  jeopardized by this legislation, and senior citizens across  this country are  aware of that.  They certainly were aware of it in  Virginia this year, my home State,  when they turned out on Tuesday in  very large numbers to send a message  to Washington that this health care  proposal and other dramatic government takeovers of sectors of our economy is unacceptable and it resulted in  a sweep across the elections in Virginia. And in the only two States in  the country where  there were Governors races up this year, New Jersey  and Virginia, Democratic Governors  were  replaced  by Republican Governors. People are  looking to Washington.  There is a story in today’s New York  Times  entitled  ‘‘Democrats  to Use  Election to Push Agenda in Congress.’’  Well, good luck with that, because I  can tell you that the people who turned  out at the polls in Virginia were not  asking for this agenda to be pushed forward as a result of what they have been  seeing going on in Washington, D.C. Instead, they want commonsense, bipartisan reforms of health care.

Private  First Class Kahoohanohano’s service was recently acknowledged with our Nation’s highest  award of merit, the Medal of Honor.  I  am  grateful  to my  colleague Senator  AKAKA for inserting a provision in this year’s  defense  authorization  bill  that  awards  the  Medal of Honor to Mr. Kahoohanohano and to  President Obama for signing the bill into law.  Awarding  the Medal of Honor  to Anthony  Kahoohanohano has  long been overdue. A  19-year-old soldier from Wailuku on the island  of Maui, Kahoohanohano bravely sacrificed his  own life to protect fellow soldiers in the area  of Chupa-ri, Korea on September 1, 1951.  After ordering members of his machine-gun  squad  to  take up more secure positions  to  provide  cover  as  U.S.  forces  withdrew,  Kahoohanohano bravely stayed behind to fight  the enemy on his own, even fighting in hand-  to-hand combat after he ran out of ammunition. He was killed  in action, but his courageous actions inspired other American troops  to launch a counterattack against the enemy.  On  behalf  of Anthony Kahoohanohano’s  family and the State of Hawaii, and in honor  of  the  service  and  sacrifice  of  our  servicemembers and veterans, I thank my colleagues for supporting this measure.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  All of those involved in with the Salute to  Old Glory program  in Woodbridge Township  should be commended for their efforts.

For 75 years they have  stood firmly to their commitment to our Nation.  One of the ways we honor our country is to  make service a tradition. In south Jersey, this  effort has gained substantial support from the  VFW, a visible, active, and honorable organization. I often cite the way in which our veterans  find ways  to continue  to serve as a  strength to our community. Veterans in south  Jersey have been a constant reminder of the  pride we take in public service throughout the  past 75 years.  VFW Post 3020 has always been supportive  of service men and women at any  time of  need. The members of VFW Post 3020 all  served this country once. Now they are serving their country again. And I for one would  like to thank them for all they have done, and  will continue to do.  Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing  the best  for  the  long  future ahead  for  this  great organization. Thank you to all of the veterans of VFW Post 3020, and thanks to all of  the members of our community who support  the VFW in their mission. God bless you all,  and God bless America.  f  HONORING LARRY SHEHADEY  HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  and DEVINNUNES Monday, November 16, 2009  ",2009

469,,111,-0.119,81,2009-11-16,Mr. DONNELLY of Indiana.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the life  and  service  of Staff Sergeant  Justin M.  DeCrow, a native son of Plymouth,  Indiana,  and a proud member of  the United States  Army. The servicemen and women of  the  United States Armed Forces serve with a selfless willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice  for the country they love and protect. A career  soldier with 13 years of honorable and dedicated service, Justin’s  life was  tragically cut  short in a senseless act of violence when a  gunman opened  fire at a Soldier Readiness  Processing facility at Fort Hood in Texas on  the 5th of November.  Justin always wanted  to be a soldier. He  graduated  from Plymouth High School  in  1996, married his high school sweetheart that  spring, and enlisted in the United States Army  immediately  thereafter. He pursued a career  as a soldier in the Army out of an unfailing  love of country and a desire to make a better  life for his family.  In the early part of his 13 year career as a  soldier, he performed  light vehicle maintenance. In 2000, Justin and his family moved to  Evans, Georgia, after he was assigned  to  nearby Fort Gordon, where he underwent  training as a communications satellite operator. He was stationed  in  that capacity  in  South Korea from September 2008 to August  of this year. In September, he was stationed  with the 16th Signal Company at Fort Hood,  Texas. He had hoped to return eventually to  Fort Gordon, when an opening became available, to be with his wife and daughter.  At Fort Hood, Justin was involved in training  new soldiers. He will be remembered by his  fellow soldiers in the United States Army as a  mentor with an undeniable charm and quick  wit, and by friends and family as a loving and  devoted father and husband. He is survived by  his wife of 14 years, Marikay, their 13-year old  daughter, Kylah, and two proud parents: Daniel DeCrow and Rhonda Thompson. He will be  missed by all.  It is my solemn duty, and humble privilege,  to honor the life, service, and memory of Staff  Sergeant Justin M. DeCrow, which stand as a  testament to the great honor possessed, and  sacrifices made, by our men and women  in  the armed forces and their families. We mourn  his  loss and offer solemn gratitude  for his  service.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE MARTY  MAJORS  FAMILY AS  THE  2009  HOLMES COUNTY FARM FAMILY  OF THE YEAR  HON.

The Majors family is an integral part of the Northwest Florida  community, and  I am proud  to honor  their  achievements.  Marty and Tiffany Majors married in 1992.  They have been farming full-time since 1996,  but  the  land on which  they  farm has been  owned by  the Majors  family  for over 100  years. Their son, Blake Majors, is a 7th grader  at Bethlehem High School and a member of  the Future Farmers of America. Together, the  family grows soybeans, peanuts, corn, oats,  and wheat. By using strip till farming practices,  the Majors are one of the area’s best soil conservationists. The family also manages a significant acreage of timberland and does custom grain harvesting as part of their agricultural enterprise.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Majors family’s tireless work  and dedication to family, faith and trade. They  are an outstanding example of the farm families that make up the backbone of our nation.  My wife Vicki and I wish Marty, Tiffany, and  Blake best wishes for continued success.

473,House,111,0.509,2,2009-12-01,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker, the estate tax, also known as the  death tax, has been a drag on America’s family-owned small businesses for  decades.  It  threatens  our Nation’s  farms and ranches, the very businesses  which produce 86 percent of U.S. agricultural products.  Farmers and ranchers work their entire lives to build their land and equipment for their operations; yet the existence of the death tax could take it  all away.  The  death  tax  impedes  economic  growth because it lowers incentives for  small family businesses to invest capital in their own economic endeavors.  In other words, it punishes success.  This flies in the face of the very principles upon which our country was  founded.  The estate tax is inappropriate, and  it needs to be eliminated once and for  all. Doing so in the right way would  lift a tremendous weight off the shoulders of America’s family-owned small  businesses, farms, and ranches.  f  CELEBRATING THE  100TH BIRTHDAY OF THE TOWN OF WAKE  FOREST, NORTH CAROLINA  (Mr. MILLER  of North  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Some people had all but lost hope that they would compete in the playoffs, but the playoffs were just  the beginning of  their Cinderella rise  to  the  top. Beginning with their first win in the playoffs against defending champions Columbus  Crew and ending with the final win over the  star-studded  LA Galaxy, Real  Salt  Lake  proved themselves to be a championship-caliber team.  Rather than relying on a few star players,  this team proved the power of teamwork and  the value of believing in one another. Led by  their first-time coach/former player Jason Kreis  and Captain Kyle Beckerman, they validated  to the world what they already knew. Never  giving up, Real came from behind to win in a  high pressure penalty kick. We would like to  congratulate Real Salt Lake and thank them  for bringing a championship home to Utah.  f  HONORING NSF INTERNATIONAL’S  65TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. JOHN D.

491,,111,-0.448,107,2009-12-01,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate NSF  International and  thank  them for the great work they have done over  the last 65 years. Since 1944, when it was established  at  the University  of Michigan’s  School of Public Health,  in Ann Arbor, NSF  International has gone on to reach innumerable achievements.  NSF International has established itself as a  leader  in  the  field of drinking water safety,  food safety, indoor air, organic certification, toy  safety, and many other areas of public health  and safety. In 1984 NSF International opened  its  first office abroad  in Brussels, Belgium.  Just over 20 years later NSF International now  maintains  offices  and  laboratories  across  North America and Europe, as well as  in  South America, Africa, and Asia. I believe their  selection as a Collaborating Centre on Food  and Water Safety as well as Indoor Environment by the World Health Organization speaks  to their outstanding international reputation in  the field.  Most importantly, NSF International has protected an untold number of consumers over  the last 65 years through their testing, certification, education, and other services. Consumer safety is critically important and is an  issue I have worked diligently on during my  career  in  the United States House of Representatives. Protecting consumers from dangerous products would not be possible without  the role that independent, not-for-profit organizations, such as NSF International, play.  This role is particularly important with our increasingly global marketplace. As more and  more products come to the United States from  abroad, extra steps must be taken to ensure  American consumers are receiving the safest  products  possible.  NSF  International  has  played a key role in certifying products worldwide as well as writing internationally recognized standards. I thank them for the very important work they do.  I am proud to say that an organization with  such an outstanding  reputation domestically  and  internationally, and an organization with  so many years of experience and achievement, was founded and is still headquartered  in the great city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. It is  organizations such as NSF International that  make Michigan, and Michigan’s 15th District,  such a wonderful place and make me so  proud to represent the area. I ask all my colleagues  to  join me  in  congratulating and  thanking NSF International.  f  RECOGNIZING DAN CALLAHAN  HON. JERRY F.

In 1999, the firm was founded by  partners Thomas Cooney, Crystal Faulkner,  and Charles Stevens. Just five years later, in  2004,  it was named Small Business of  the  Year by the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber of Commerce—the first accounting firm to  receive such an honor.  Many Cincinnati  institutions have come  to  rely on the firm’s accounting experience and  expertise over the past ten years. The firm is  also routinely recognized for its many philanthropic and volunteer endeavors. Just recently,  the firm participated in the 10th Accounting for  Kids Day. Cooney, Faulkner and Stevens  founded  this event  to promote  financial  literacy.  Many Cincinnatians are familiar with Thomas Cooney and Crystal Faulkner’s weekday  radio  show  titled  BusinessWise  on  89.7  WNKU.

493,House,111,0.392,4,2009-12-09,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Speaker, this  week debate continues in the Senate  over a massive health care overhaul.  What’s at stake for seniors? Many seniors will probably see their benefits cut  or higher premiums. The Senate bill  cuts more than $135 billion from hospitals serving seniors. It cuts $40 billion from home health agencies, $15 billion from nursing homes, and nearly $8  billion from hospices—an all-important  service our seniors depends on.  Seniors deserve to know how Washington Democrats are going to pay for  their massive new government-run bureaucracy because cuts like these will  affect their care.  As a heart surgeon, I know that we  can do better. We need to work together to strengthen Medicare, putting  it on sound footing to ensure that it  will be there when seniors need help  with their health care costs.  We need to lower health care costs  for seniors and all Americans by increasing competition in the insurance  marketplace, promoting wellness programs, and limiting frivolous lawsuits  in medicine. We can accomplish these  commonsense solutions if we work together.  Let’s protect seniors. Let’s protect  Medicare.  f  AMERICAN JOBS ARE TRENDING  IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2009
494,House,111,-0.378,25,2009-12-09,Mr. LEVIN.," Let’s be clear what’s involved in the pay-fors: tax-haven legislation, also the issue of fairness.  Those who invest their own money  will continue to receive capital gains  tax treatment, period. Those who manage other people’s money will have to  pay ordinary income tax like everybody else who performs services. There  is widespread support for this.  Gregory Mankiw, who was on President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors, said this:  ‘‘Deferred compensation, even risky compensation, is still  compensation, and it should be taxed  as such . . . When I wrote my book,  that was sweat equity . . . I oppose different levels of taxation on different  types of compensation.’’  This from a former member of President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisors, William Niskanen: ‘‘The share  of investment profits are basically fees  for managing other people’s money.’’  Also, another person who was deputy  undersecretary  under  George  H.W.  Bush, Professor Michael Graetz:  ‘‘I  think it’s odd that people making that  much money off of essentially labor income  should be paying  lower  rates  than, than the average . . . than their  secretaries are, to put it baldly.’’  And then from the New York Times:  ‘‘They’re actively managing assets, and  should be taxed accordingly as managers earning compensation . . . Congress will achieve a significant victory,  for  fairness and  for  fiscal  responsibility, if it ends the breaks that are  skewing the Tax Code in favor of the  most advantaged Americans.’’  And likewise, the Washington Post:  ‘‘But  these  fund managers,  for  the  most part, are not risking their own  money.’’ And I  insert to the extent  they are, they get capital gains treatment. ‘‘Besides, plenty of risky industries don’t enjoy comparable tax benefits. Income earned from managing an  investment partnership fund should be  treated just like the income earned for  providing any other service.’’  And I could quote this from William  Stanfill, who’s a manager of venture  capital. He says, ‘‘Many Americans invest sweat equity  in their  jobs and  their businesses, take risks, contribute  to the economy, and may have to wait  a  long time before their hard work  pays off. But they still pay ordinary income tax rates on their compensation.  To the extent we take risk, we take it  with other people’s money.’’  And that’s why the statement of administration policy is very clear from  the President. ‘‘The legislation would  fulfill  the  administration’s  commitment to crack down on overseas tax  havens and put a stop to billions of dollars’ worth of tax abuse and would end  the special preferential treatment for  carried interest income.’’  ",2009

496,House,111,0.518,25,2009-12-09,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise and strongly oppose this bill.  Encouraging research jobs on the one  hand while killing local real estate and  construction jobs on the other makes  no economic sense. In making one of  our most vulnerable sectors, commercial real estate, which faces the next  real crisis in America, making that situation worse is going to kill jobs in  this country. That type of thing is the  reason that this new Congress and this  White House has  failed  to get  the  American economy going.  Let me explain. There are parts of  this bill that all of us support, including cracking down on tax evaders but  encouraging  companies  to keep  research and development jobs; letting  States, local taxpayers, write off the  State and local sales taxes. And our  State, I’m proud to say, we fought to  restore this. It saves our taxpayers $1.2  billion  a  year,  creates  22,000  jobs.  That’s  fairness.  In helping  teachers  write off, for example, their supplies  they pay out of their pocket to help  educate their students, we all agree on  that. That’s not the question.  But what they do in this bill as well,  they target some of our most basic  companies at home. They say they’re  going after those Wall Street managers  of your money, the ones who have their  feet up on the desk who just shuffle  money back and forth and make billions of dollars. That’s what they say  they’re aiming at. What they’re hitting  is Main Street, our real estate partnerships. These are our local companies  that build our office buildings, apartments, shopping centers, movie theaters, our industrial parks. There are no  abuses in this. These are the people  who create jobs at home.  This bill increases their tax, almost  triples their taxes, and these are people  who put in sweat equity for 15 years, 20  years. Only if they get it right do they  make a dollar back on all of their hard  work. This is who they nearly triple  the taxes on.  These are the people, 1.2 million, traditional real estate partnerships, who  will pay the price if this bill passes, because this makes no economic sense  and damages jobs. That’s why this bill  is dead on arrival in the Senate, deader  than a doornail, because with  this  economy, we ought to be creating jobs  and not killing jobs.  ",2009
497,Senate,111,-0.362,116,2009-12-09,Mr. MENENDEZ.," I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for yielding me the  time.  Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the Dorgan amendment to  allow the importation of drugs from 32  different countries in the world into  the medicine  cabinets  of American  families. I believe that is, at its core, a  regressive amendment.  This amendment, however well-intentioned, reminds me of a time when the  lack of sufficient regulation allowed  people to sell snake oil and magic elixirs. Let’s not relive that history. Let’s  learn from it.  I am sure many in this Chamber remember a time when the doctor would  give us a prescription, we would take  that to the local pharmacy, and the  one thing we never did was question  what was in the bottle. Now, with this  amendment, we would not be so certain. We would not be sure that what is  in the bottle is what we think it is. We  would not be so certain from where it  came. It could be directly from countries all over the world—Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, or  any 1 of 28 other countries, and I will  speak to that. Yes, I have heard they  are part of the European Union, but I  will  talk about what  the European  Union just said about their challenges  with counterfeit drugs. Or maybe they  will come indirectly from any number  of countries that have proven to make  tainted medicine; those who are not  part of the European Union but who  are counterfeiting their drugs into the  European Union,  getting  into  their  supply chain and ultimately getting to  us, if we were to allow it to happen. We  would not be absolutely sure of the  conditions under which they were manufactured, whether they are safe to  use, or where their ingredients originated.  Health  care  reform  and  lowering  costs does not mean we should roll the  dice with the health and safety of the  American people.  I appreciate my colleagues’ interest  in bringing  lower cost drugs to the  market. In fact, I agree with them. But  we cannot risk the health and safety of  the American people in order to do it,  and I am afraid this amendment would  do just that.  We have heard a lot about the FDA—  the Food and Drug Administration.  Yes, they are the ones who safeguard  Americans from having the wrong type  of drugs get into our marketplace or  making sure the right type of drugs are  approved and the wrong ones stay out.  I have heard the stories of Americans  searching  for affordable prescription  drugs and either going online to get  them or traveling sometimes. But we  have to ensure the drugs they buy are  not counterfeit, not tainted, not substandard, and that they are what the  doctor ordered and will work.  This amendment would undo current  safety protections that ensure that patients are getting prescription medications that are the same in substance,  quality, and quantity their doctor has  prescribed. So let’s see what the FDA  said.  In a letter from the Food and Drug  Administration issued the other day to  one of our colleagues in the Senate,  Commissioner Hamburg said there are  four potential risks to patients, in her  opinion, that have to be addressed.  First, she is concerned that some imported drugs may not be safe and effective because they were not subject to a  rigorous regulatory review prior to approval. Second,  she  says  the drugs  ‘‘may not be a consistently made, high  quality product because they were not  manufactured in a facility that complied with appropriate good manufacturing procedures.’’  Third, the drugs ‘‘may not be substitutable with the FDA approved products because of differences in composition or manufacturing.’’  And, fourth, the drugs simply ‘‘may  not be what they purport to be’’ because inadequate safeguards in the supply chain may have allowed contamination or—worse—counterfeiting.  In addition, the FDA’s letter went on  to cite significant ‘‘safety concerns related to allowing the importation of  nonbioequivalent  products  . . .  and  confusion in distribution and labeling  between foreign products and the domestic product.’’  VerDate Nov 24 2008  04:49 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09DE6.062 S09DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2009
