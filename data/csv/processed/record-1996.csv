0,Senate,104,-0.276,6,1,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, first of an  commend Senator DOLE and  those  I  leaders on the other side of the aif?ie.  who yesterday made it possible to pass  a clean CR. I am sorry we did not do it  sooner. I wish it had been done sooner~  But I commend and applaud the Repub lican leadership and those Members of  the Senate who allowed this to go for:-.  ward.  ; ;  Mr. President, I grew up in a small  town in southern Nevada. When I was  in the eighth grade, there were six kids.  in the class. That was one of our bigger  classes.  In  the  school at  that  time  there was a bully. He was an eighth grader and everyone in the school was  afraid of him. If they were not afraid of  him they worked something out with  him, so that they could live with him.~  We  rarely had new people come  to  school  there, but there was a young  boy who came  to school, an eighth grader, somewhat small in stature, who  came from someplace in Arizona~ His  name was Gary. He was a quiet young  lad. And he was pushed around by this  bully for 3 or 4 days, a week, 2 weeks.  Finally this young man said I have had  enough of this and we are going to set tle this. And this young boy agreed to  fight the big bully. Everyone knew the  bully would win, everyone except Gary.  And they engaged in fisticuffs and the  young man, like one of the heroes in  the books we read as young kids, won  the fight. The bully was all through.  He no longer pushed anyone around.  The reason I mention that, we kind  of have a bully running around Con gress. It is in the form of 73 Republican  freshman Congressmen. They have sud denly gotten the stature that they can  push everybody around. Mr. President,  there are 535 Members of Congress, 435  House Members. It seems to me that  leaves about 360-plus Members of the  House who should be able to do pretty  much what they want to do. Mr. Presi dent, 73 should not a bully make; 73  should no longer be able to push a body  of 535 people around. The  time has  come, as when Gary came to Search light Elementary School many, many  years ago, to stand up for what is right.  What is right is to allow people to go  to work and to be paid for working. I  think it is absolutely unreasonable and  unconscionable that the American tax payer would be told: Yes, we are going  to pay these people someday in the fu ture. We are going to pay them, but  they do not have to work for the pay.  Please, somebody tell me how that is  rational? How is that reasonable? We  are saying, ""Go ahead and stay home,  do not work, and we will pay you any way""?  Or, we have another deal  floating  around. You can come back to work  but you cannot buy any pencils, cannot  buy any gas for cars. You basically  cannot do anything.  Mr. President, I suggest that people  of good will, both Democrats and Re publicans, should follow the lead of the  Republican  leadership  in the Senate,  ",1996
1,House,104,0.47,45,1,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, to follow  my friend, it is true that this is the  first President who sent our  jobs  to  Mexico, our troops to Bosnia, and our  balanced budget  to  the White House  trash can.  He  has done  something else, Mr.  Speaker, and that is to veto  the de fense authorization bill; and the reason  the President vetoed  the defense au thorization bill  is because we say in  that bill, we  shall  defend America  against ICBM's and have that system  in place by the year 2003. The President  refuses  to defend  this country while  Iraq, Libya, China, and others hurry up  and accelerate their programs on offen sive missiles.  Defend America. Vote to override the  President's veto today.  AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ARE  BEING CHEATED  (Mr. WYNN asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1996
2,House,104,-0.38,45,1,Mr. WYNN.," Mr. Speaker, it appears  that self-styled Republican revolution aries believe that the end justifies the  means. Somehow they have this notion  that  these Federal workers are  the  President's Federal workers, or  they  are  the Democrats' Federal workers.  Sorry, fellows. They are the taxpayers'  Federal workers, and the taxpayers are  being cheated because of your shut down.  They are being cheated because small  businesses cannot get their loans proc essed through the SBA. They are being  cheated because small businesses can not bid on contracts because the con tract offices are closed. They are being  cheated because toxic waste cleanup is  not proceeding. They are being cheated  because student loan applications are  not being processed. They are being  cheated because FH:A home mortgage  applications are not being processed.  And then they go on and abuse the  Federal workers: No checks  for  the  Federal workers. That means no mort gage payments, no utility payments,  and, sometimes, no food on the table.  There is one thing wrong with these  self-styled  revolutionaries.  Someone  told  them that  the end  justifies  the  means, and they do not care who they  hurt.  In this case, they hurt the taxpayer  and they hurt our Federal workers, and  that is a shame, Mr. Speaker.  D 1345  REPUBLICANS HA VE MET  BALANCED BUDGET CHALLENGE  (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1996
3,House,104,0.627,45,1,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, I  remember, and I  think the American  people remember, that last year when  we Republicans tried to pass a balanced  budget amendment, we were defeated  because the Democrats claimed, ""Oh,  my goodness, you don't need a  bal anced budget amendment, you don't  need to amend the Constitution, just  present a balanced budget. Why do you  have to amend the Constitution?""  OK, we met the challenge. The Re publicans came up with a  balanced  budget. And the very same Democrats  who voted against the balanced budget  amendment to the Constitution, claim ing we should just do it here legisla tively, are now opposing our balanced  budget.  For 4 years we have heard this Presi dent claim to be a new Democrat. In  fact, 4 years ago he was running on a  campaign motto of being someone who  was going to end welfare as we know it  and would balance  the budget. Now,  after 4 years of rhetoric, we have come  to where he cannot dodge anymore.  The fact  is we have  laid upon  the  table a balanced budget. He claims to  have been  in  favor of  the balanced  budget. I hope the American people re member that,  too. But when the Re publicans lay their alternative out, the  President refuses to lay out his alter native, and that is the reason the Gov ernment is shut down today.  Ms.  DEMAND FOR A CONTINUING  RESOLUTION  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  JACKSON-LEE  of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, first let me offer my deepest  sympathy to the Fazio family and offer  our love.  A  tragedy occurred  today  in  this  House, however. One Nation under God,  indivisible, and with liberty and justice  for all, we stood and pledged allegiance  to the U.S. flag. This is supposed to be  a nation that protects working Ameri cans, working people.  But yesterday in my community a  Government worker performing essen tial services in the veterans hospital  received for her 80 hours of work a S5  salary check. That is right, Mr. Speaker, S5 for 80 hours of work, a working  parent with children, trying to survive,  and yet she is there nurturing our vet erans  of war without getting  com pensated.  The Republicans refuse to put on the  floor today a continuing resolution to  open the doors of Government and pay  these workers to provide the services  that  the  taxpayers of America have  asked them to provide. That is all we  request, Mr. Speaker, and  demand  that we put on this floor a continuing  resolution  to open  this Government  today. It is a disgrace on this House's  ability to govern. Pass the Dole pro posal to open this Government now.  I  SUNDRY MESSAGES FROM THE  PRESIDENT  Sundry messages in writing from the  President of  the United States were  communicated  to  the House by Mr.  Edwin Thomas, one of his secretaries.  AMERICA NEEDS A BALANCED  BUDGET  (Mr. ROYCE asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1996
4,House,104,0.661,45,1,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I just want  to take a minute, as we commence the  second session of the 104th Congress, to  focus on the necessity of reaching the  goal of a balanced Federal budget.  Four years from now we will enter  upon  the  third millennium and  the  225th year of our Nation and,  iron ically, although the American revolu tion was mostly about taxes, an Amer ican child born today will inherit a tax  bill of $186,000 just to cover his or her  share of the interest on the national  debt. That is the direct per capita cost  of financing S5 trillion. That is not the  cost of paying  it off. That  is  that  child's cost in taxes during his or her  lifetime.  That is not the only cost of this enor mous debt. That same child born today  will have to pay higher monthly mort gage payments, higher car payments,  higher college loan payments, all be cause of a $5 trillion debt. That is be cause the Federal Government will be  sopping up over half of the available  credit in the markets as it continually  refinances  the debt, causing interest  rates to remain arbitrarily high.  GO DOWN, MR. PRESIDENT, WAY  DOWN TO CONGRESSLAND  (Mr. LEWIS of Georgia asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1996

6,House,104,0.49,58,1,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  include for the record the following remarks re garding Bill Clinton's veto of this defense au thorization conference report. I spent this past  New Year's weekend with our troops and their  families in Germany as they prepared for de ployment into Bosnia This defense bill includ ing pay raises, increased housing allowances,  vital weapons modernization, and new combat  readiness priorities, is exactly what these sol diers and  their  families want-it  is exactly  what  they  need. Please support  this  con ference report and please support an override  of the Clinton veto-a veto against our troops  deploying to Bosnia!  CONGRESSMAN RoBERT K. DoRNAN REBUKES  CLINTON FOR VETO OF DEFENSE BILL  .""It's absolutely absurd for Bill Clinton to  send our troops into civil war in Bosnia and  then veto a defense authorization bill which  provides them and their families so much  support,"" commented Congressman Robert  K. Dornan of California who, as the chair man of the House National Security Sub committee on Military Personnel, was one of  the prime authors of the FY 1996 defense bill  which the president rejected yesterday.  ""General Omar Bradley once  said  that  'Fairness, diligence, sound preparation, pro fessional skill and loyalty are the marks of  American military leadership.' Where's your  fairness; where's your  loyalty, Mr. Presi dent?""  Dornan  firmly believes  this defense bill  contains exactly what the troops and their  families scheduled for deployment to Bosnia  need. Among the provisions in the bill Dor nan helped develop and pass include a mod est 2.4 percent military pay raise, a 5.2 per cent increase in the basic allowance for quar ters/housing, and new guidelines for account ability of American POWs and MIAs. Dor nan, who introduced the first and only free  standing legislation to restore the pay raise  two years ago, had harsh words for the Presi dent. ""After twice canceling a modest pay  raise for our military, a raise that was twice  restored by the U.S. Congress, Clinton now is  attempting to gain credit for this raise by  separating it from  the rest of the defense  bill. The troops already were expecting this  raise! Other real benefits, such a.s the addi tional housing funding and POW/MIA legisla tion, are being held hostage to cheap liberal  politics!""  In his veto statement, Clinton described  his objections to three major provisions of  the bill. All three provisions were major ini tiatives by Congressman Dornan. ""Clinton  objects to immediately deploying an effec tive ballistic missile defense, despite the fact  that we Republicans have identified a near  term/low cost system known as 'upper tier'  which would modify existing Navy ships a.nd  missiles for wide a.rea missile defense. Clin ton objects to my limitations on placing U.S.  troops under  foreign  and U.N.  command,  even though this is precisely the reason why  he cost 19 Americans their lives in Somalia.  Finally, Clinton objects  to restrictions on  U.S. defense funding going to Russia, includ ing my provision to restrict some aid pend ing an end to Russian work on offensive bio logical weapons. It's obvious 'Peacenik Clin ton' is more interested in supporting Third  World dictators with missiles,  the United  Nations, and communists in Russia than sup porting the United States military and the  United States taxpayer!""  THE FISCAL YEAR 1996 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION  CONFERENCE REPORT  Republicans Restore Defense Spending After  Clinton Cuts Combat Readiness  President Bill Clinton has more than dou bled the defense cuts promised by Candidate  Clinton-$120 billion!  Clinton's defense plan-the ""Bottom Up  Review""-should be called the ""Bottom Out  Plan""-it's underfunded by as much as $150  billion!  Republicans, under the leadership of Floyd  Spence, have restored just ~ billion to de fense,  including  programs  I  persona.Uy  helped initiate such as: additional funding  for Army ""scout"" helicopters-both the OH58D ""Kiowa Warrior"" and RAH~ ""Coman che"", additional  funding  to build ""more""  than 20 B-2 bombers and equip the B-lB with  precision guided munitions, a.nd additional  funding for a near term ballistic missile de fense capability using existing Navy Aegis  cruisers and destroyers.  My Subcommittee on Personnel, thanks to  the efforts of my ranking Democrat Owen  Pickett and the hard work of all my sub committee members,  improved military  quality of life by: increasing military hous ing allowance by 35 percent; setting perma nent personnel  levels  to stop  the  ""draw down,"" and  increasing the number of na tional guard technicians.  I also included several initiatives that re verse the  trend of liberal social programs  within the department designed to conduct  combat operations.  This bill: stops abortions at U.S. military  hospitals, stops pay for convicted military  prisoners, establishes strict new guidelines  for the accountability of American Prisoners  of War and Missing in Action, discharges all  non-deployable HIV+military personnel, and  a.wards the AFEM to U.S. veterans of El Sal vador.  In closing, I would remind those who op pose this bill of the wise words of one of our  founding  fathers, Benjamin Franklin, who  warned:  The expenses required to prevent a war are  much lighter than those that will, if not pre vented, be absolutely necessary to maintain  it.  Support our  troops,  support moderniza tion, support this conference report.  ",1996

17,,104,-0.376,136,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday  the Washington Post dedicated  the Outlook  Section of the newspaper to  its outstanding  editorial cartoonist, Herb Block-Herblock-in  appropriate  recognition of his 50 years of  cartooning for the Post In 1946 Herb accept ed the offer to join the Washington Post, and  for  the  past  half-century, we  have  been  blessed or-at least  in  the view of some- cursed with his wit, his humor, and his prin ciples.  The selection of his cartoons from the past  50 years, which was included in  the Outlook  Section, brought back memories of the high  points and low points of the political history of  our Nation. Looking  through  these cartoons  has brought Herb's wonderful gift into dramatic  perspective  for me. With a  few well drawn  lines and a few well chosen words, he has the  ability to convey the essence of an entire com plex political  issue and highlight the absurd ities and inconsistencies.  But the laughter is never at the expense of  the message. This is not humor for the sake  of humor, but wit with a point. I admire Herb's  humor, but even more I admire his principles.  His cartoons always reflect his strongly held  point of view, and I must say that most of the  time I am in perfect agreement with him.  Mr. Speaker, a few years ago when  chairman of the House subcommittee conduct ing the investigation of fraud and mismanage ment at the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, Herb did a number of delightful  and insightful cartoons about the HUD scan dal. At that time, I invited Herb to join me for  lunch at the Member's dining room. We spent  a delightful hour or more  talking about his  background and highlights of his career. He  mentioned  then  that  generally  avoids  spending time with those of us whom he car toons, but I was delighted that he made an ex ception for me that day.  It was an engaging  experience that I still remember fondly.  Mr. Speaker, we in the Congress seem to  find ourselves  the  frequent  focus of Herb's  sharp wit and his sharper pen. This past year,  and particularly these past 19 days of GovernI was  he  January 3, 1996  ment shutdown, have provided him with abun dant material, which he has exploited with this  typical skill.  1n  the past few days, as well as  throughout the last half-century, Herb's humor  and his principled point of view are important  in keeping political  issues  in perspective.  If  this were Japan,  I am certain  that Herblock  would be officially declared a ""National Treas ure."" He is a national treasure, and I invite my  colleagues to join me in paying tribute to him  for his contribution to our national political de bate and to the strength of our democracy.  Mr. Speaker, Kate Graham-the chairman  of the Executive Committee of the Washington  Post Co. who has had extensive experience  and  frequent exasperation with Herb-paid  homage to Herblock in a wonderful column in  Sunday's Outlook.  I ask that her column be  placed  in  the RECORD, and  I urge my col leagues to read it.  [From the Washington Post, Dec. 31, 1995]  A TIGER BY THE TAIL-THE TURBULENT  PLEASURES OF LIFE WITH HERB  (By Katharine Graham)  My mother had a saying: ""Any man worth  marrying is impossible to live with."" Why  does this make me think of my glorious life  and times with Herblock, one of the greatest  ornaments to The Post and to all of journal ism? Underneath his genius for cartooning  and writing lies a modest, sweet, aw-shucks  personality. Underneath that lies a layer of  iron and steel. For the publishers and editors  over him-or under him, as it would be more  accurate to say-it's like having a  tiger by  the tail.  Herb started out in his hometown of Chi cago doing editorial cartoons for the Chicago  Daily News in 1929. Four years later he be came a syndicated editorial cartoonist for  the Newspaper Enterprise Association Serv ice in Cleveland, where he won the first of  his three Pulitzer Prizes.  When World Warn came along, Herb went  into the Army and produced and edited a fea ture service for Army newspapers. After the  war, Herb was passing through Washington.  A cha.nee encounter led to a meeting with  my father, Eugene Meyer, who happened to  be desperately looking for a cartoonist for  The Post. Herb provided a few samples and in  return, my father gave Herb a subscription  to the paper. ""So you can see how you like  us,"" my father explained.  Evidently the attraction was mutual. Herb  arrived at The Post the same week that my  husband, Phil Graham, arrived in January of  1946. The extraordinary quality of Herb's  eye, his insights and sharp comments imme diately stood out. When The Post was strug gling for its existence, Herb was one of its  major assets, as he has been throughout his  50 years here. The Post and Herblock are for ever intertwined. If The Post is his forum, he  helped create it. And he has been its shining  light.  Herb fought for and earned a unique posi tion at the paper: one of complete independ ence of anybody and anything. Journalistic  enterprises run best when writers and editors  have a lot of autonomy. But Herb's case is  extreme. And because he's a genius, it works.  Since he arrived at The Post, five editors  and five publishers all have learned a car dinal rule: Don't mess with Herb. He's just as  tough within the confines of The Post as he  is in the political world outside.  Herb's independence evolved gradually. In  the early years, he made several sketches for  the day's cartoon and dutifUlly submitted  them to the editorial page editor to choose.  ",1996
18,Senate,104,-0.266,149,1,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  let  me speak about one other issue that I  am quite concerned about, and that is  the  implication of what  is going on  now for the work of this Congress in  the second session and in future ses sions. There has been a  lot of talk  about hostage-taking. There was a very  good editorial that has been referred to  in  the Washington  Post  yesterday  about how the current shutdown is an  example of hostage-taking. Yet,  the  editorial stated, I  thought, very elo quently:  Hostage-taking  is  an  ugly  business.  It  doesn't matter what the cause. Innocent peo ple are seized and used as pawns;  they be come political trading stamps whose welfare  is exchanged for  things  the hostage-taker  could not win by normal means.  Obviously, the most dramatic exam ple of hostage-taking in recent history  in this country was the hostage-taking  in Iran in November 1979. It could be  debated whether  the current Govern ment shutdown rises to the level of a  hostage-taking. Perhaps this is just a  using of public servants, Federal em ployees, as pawns in a larger political  game, and I will leave to others the de bate about whether this is, in fact, a  hostage-taking.  But, Mr. President, in my view, when  each of us took our oath of office, and  that oath included the duty to protect  and defend the Constitution, implied in  that was the responsibility to maintain  a  functioning Government. Now,  that  is not written into the Constitution,  but I  think it is clearly implied that  those of us who seek public office will  take on that responsibility.  We can argue about what the Govern ment ought to do, we can argue about  how large the Government ought to be,  we can argue about how many employ ees ought to be hired by the Federal  Government, but the basic responsibil ity to maintain a functioning Govern ment is something about which I think  is very difficult for us to argue.  The Republican  leadership  in  the  House has taken a different view. They  are saying that as to the parts of the  Government  which  today  remain  closed, they do not share that respon sibility to maintain those parts of the  Government functioning. They believe  that is the President's problem, it is  not their problem.  Those who wrote our Constitution es tablished  a  system  of  government  where power is shared, but also a sys tem of government where responsibil ity is shared, and part of that respon sibility that is shared is the respon sibility to maintain a functioning Gov ernment.

Brett, as Senators know, is the  quarterback of the Green Bay Packers.  When I  introduced the resolution, I  did so on my behalf and TRENT LOTT, as  a cosponsor. I  learned, after adopting  the  resolution,  that  the  two distin guished Senators from Wisconsin want ed their names to be added as cospon sors of the resolution. I looked at the  RECORD and it does reflect that later in  the RECORD.

So I am pleased  that they joined us in the resolution  commending and congratulating Brett  Favre for the great honor that he re ceived.

22,Senate,104,-0.145,175,1,Mr. NUNN.," Mr. President,  today a  grateful Nation pays its final tribute to  a  true patriot and hero, Adm. Arleigh  A. Burke, who died on Monday at the  age of 94.  Admiral Burke will be buried on the  grounds of the Naval Academy in An napolis, where he graduated in 1923. His  service to the Nation will serve as a  model to Academy graduates as well as  all members of the Armed Forces for  generations to come.  Admiral Burke said he was attracted  to the NaVY because, in his words, the  rules were  ""strict,  known  and  ob served."" His adherence to the rules was  a matter of personal honor, not bureau cratic timidity. When it came to strat egy and tactics, he was a bold innova tor. During World War Il, he initiated  dramatic changes in naval doctrine, de veloping and implementing tactics re lying on the speed and maneuverability  to destroyers armed with torpedoes to  undertake offensive operations.  Admiral Burke's Destroyer Squadron  23, known as the ""Little Beavers"" com piled an outstanding combat record in  the Pacific in 1943, which earned him  the Distinguished Service Medal,  the  Navy Cross, and the Legion of Merit.  During  the assaults on Bougainville  and Buka in the Solomon Islands, he  made  two dramatic high speed runs,  crippling Japanese airfields and sink ing a large number of Japanese vessels.  Reflecting  the  speed and daring  of  these maneuvers, Adm. William F. Hal sey gave him the nickname ""Thirty One Knot Burke"" after Burke sent a  message  to American  transports an nouncing: ""Stand aside! Stand aside!  I'm coming  through at 31 knots."" A  Presidential Unit Citation praised the  squadron's ""daring defiance of repeated  attacks by hostile groups"" and its at tacks on  the ""enemy's strongly for tified shores  to carry out sustained  bombardments against Japanese coast al defenses and render effective cover  and fire support for * * * major inva sion operations * * *.""  Subsequently he helped plan the in vasions of Iwo Jima, Guam, the Mari anas, and Okinawa. At Okinawa,  the  ship on which he was serving was hit  by kamikaze suicide planes, and he was  awarded  the Silver Star for rescuing  sailors  trapped in a compartment by  smoke and fire resulting from the at tack.  After the war, he served in the office  of the Chief of Naval Operations, where  he produced an influential report em phasizing the vital role of the Navy in  the post-war national security estab lishment. Although  the  inter-service  rivalries of the period nearly cost him  Burke  promotion  to  the grade of admiral,  President Truman recognized his skills  and character and he was promoted.  During  the Korean war, Admiral  Burke served as commander of a cruis er division and as a member of the  Military Armistice  Commission.  In  1955, he was appointed by President Ei senhower and confirmed by the Senate  as Chief of Naval Operations, a position  he  filled  for an unprecedented  three  terms. He played a key role in the de velopment  of  antisubmarine  tech nology,  the Polaris  submarine,  and  strengthening allied navies.  President Kennedy offered him  the  opportunity to serve a fourth term as  CNO, but Admiral Burke declined so  that the NaVY could have younger lead ership. After retiring from  the Navy,  he helped to establish and lead the Cen ter  for Strategic  and  International  Studies, which has provided numerous  influential studies on national security  matters. He also served as president of  the Capital Area Council of the Boy  Scouts of America.  In January 1977,  Admiral Burke was awarded  the Na tion's  highest  civilian  award,  the  Medal of Freedom, by President Ford.  The NaVY's Arleigh  class  is  named  in his honor. When  the  lead  ship,  the Arleigh Burke, was commis sioned in 1991, he gave the crew a sim ple, direct message reflecting his belief  in providing  the NaVY with  the best  equipment and hard  training:  ""This  ship is built to fight,"" he said. ""You'd  better know how."" It is most fitting  that  the crew of  the  lead ship,  the  Arleigh Burke, will be present to honor  him today.  The  current Chief of Naval Oper ations, Adm. Mike Boorda, summed up  Admiral Burke's career when he said:  ""Admiral Arleigh Burke defined what  it means to be a naval officer: relent less  in combat,  resourceful  in com mand and revered by his crews. He was  a sailor's sailor.""  I wish to express my condolences to  his wife of 72 years, Roberta ""Bobbie""  Gorsuch Burke, and to express my ap preciation for his devoted service  to  our Nation.  I think we can indeed say-all of us  can say-that he followed military af fairs, and that Admiral Burke, in Ad miral Boorda's words indeed ""* * * de fined what it means to be a naval offi cer: relentless in combat, resourceful  in command and revered by his crews.""  He was, indeed, ""a sailor's sailor.""  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues  for the time, and I will yield back any  I have.  ORDER OF PROCEDURE  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.  ",1996
23,Senate,104,-0.374,175,1,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, there is a  unanimous-consent agreement, as I un derstand it,  to recess subject to  the  call of the Chair. I wonder if I could  ask unanimous consent that I might be  heard for not more than 3 minutes.  ",1996
24,House,104,-0.32,188,1,Mr. WISE.," Mr. Speaker, this is day 20  of the partial Government shutdown.  Yesterday the Eastern Panhandle So cial Service Agency called to tell me  the  first Federal worker was  facing  eviction. Another Federal worker told  me yesterday that his mortgage com pany would not accept even partial  payment  for his mortgage. Today  I  have  contacted  the West Virginia  Bankers Association asking  that  its  member banks work closely with Fed eral  employees  facing  financial  dif ficulties. They are not unemployed be cause of any fault of their own, and if,  as the Republican leadership promises,  they are going to be paid eventually,  they deserve credit forbearance. But  even that does not help with the check out line at the grocery store, paying  the heating bill, or buying  the kids'  shoes.  Now there is word that the Gingrich  Republican leadership wants to recess  the House for 3 weeks leaving the Gov ernment  partially  shut  down. Mr.  Speaker,  I  oppose  the Government  going on another recess while the Gov ernment  is still shut down and  tax payers pay $40 million a day for serv ices they are not receiving.  I voted yesterday to open the Gov ernment up. I am going to vote today  against  letting  the Congress  leave  today. Mr. Speaker, if the Government  is not working, then at least the Con gress should be.  D 1030  LIBERAL GIVEAWAY  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1996
25,House,104,0.425,188,1,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, A  well-known news magazine  this week  called tax cuts a ""giveaway.""  That illustrates precisely the liberal  mind-set of some  in  the media and  most in this administration.  They actually think that the money  of hard-working, lawabiding taxpayers  belongs to the Government, not to the  people who earned it.  Tax cuts mean American  families  will keep more. Liberals in the media  and  in  the administration want  the  Government to  take more and spend  more.  Americans now are staggering under  the heaviest tax burden in history. And  the top half of wage earners already  pay 95 percent of all income taxes.  The real question is: Who knows best  how to spend ha.rd-earned dollars-the  American people or the Federal Gov ernment?  mSTORIC HEIGHTS OF  IRRESPONSIBILITY  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1996
26,House,104,-0.379,188,1,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, we have  risen  to historic heights of irrespon sibility  led by our history professor.  What a shame. What a shame. A pre vious speaker said that we needed a  key to unlock Government, and he did  not have the key. He was wrong.  This is the key given to all 435 of us  by the voters of our districts. It is a  district question for each of us to be  reasonable  and  responsible. We  had  that opportunity yesterday and we had  a vote, and of all of the Republicans in  the House, only two, only two of my  colleagues,  the  gentlewoman  from  Maryland [Mrs. MORELLA] and the gen tleman from Virginia [Mr. DAVIS], used  this card to unlock the lockout of Gov ernment employees and Government  services to the American public.  My friend from Virginia who spoke  previously  said,  stop making  this a  partisan issue. BOB DOLE is the leading  candidate for President in the Repub lican Party. He  said,  this does not  make sense.  HA VE  SALA SHUT MEMBERS  SHOULD  RIES WITHHELD DURING  DOWN  (Mrs. MORELLA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1996
27,House,104,-0.018,188,1,Mrs. MORELLA.," Mr. Speaker, this is  day 20 of the partial shutdown of Fed eral Government; 760,000 Federal em ployees  did  not  receive  their  pay checks, and 280,000 of them cannot even  report to work, although I hear many  of them are trying very hard to do so;  they do want to work.  I am a Federal employee. If our Fed eral employees are not being paid, I am  having my salary withheld just as they  are  having  their  salaries withheld.  They are being held hostage.  Also, I am here to work. I am not fur loughed, and I will stay here to work,  and  I will vote against  this House  recessing until we have our Federal  Government operating fully again. It is  our responsibility; let us rise to it on  both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and  open up Government.  CHILD SUPPORT SUFFERS DURING  SHUTDOWN  (Ms. WOOLSEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her re marks.)  ",1996
28,House,104,-0.556,188,1,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  it is  truly difficult  to balance  the family  budget when you do not know when the  next check is coming in. I know, be cause 28 years ago I was a single work ing mother with three small children,  and I never received the child support  that I was owed. Yet, as we head into  the 20th day of the Gingrich Government shutdown, that is the same situa tion that the new majority is forcing  on  thousands  of American  families.  Each day the Gingrich shutdown drags  on, approximately 20,000 deadbeat par ents get off the hook from paying their  child support.  It is one thing being poor, Mr. Speak er, but not knowing when and  check will come in severely compounds  the problem.  By  continuing  to  insist  on  huge  Medicare cuts and education cuts and  massive special interest tax breaks, the  Gingrich Republicans are leaving thou sands of American families  in limbo,  not knowing when  they will  receive  their next child support check. It is  time to end the Gingrich shutdown.  if a  CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT  SHARE BLAME FOR SHUTDOWN  (Mr. DAVIS asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  Mr. DA VIS. Mr. Speaker, this is dis graceful. We have Members over here  saying it is GINGRICH'S fault, it is the  President's fault. it is all of our faults,  folks. We have not been able to get our  act together. We could pass a continu ing resolution. I favor doing that, and  I voted yesterday with my colleagues  to do it. But the President could have  signed  the appropriation bills, or he  could have put a balanced budget on  the table and that would end this en tirely too. So we all share blame.  One of the most outrageous proposals  I have seen is to recess this Congress  until January 23. If we recess the time  to move  the discharge petition,  that  will  take a  longer period of time.  I  think that is wrong. We ought to bring  this to a vote and let the House vote on  it. Congress would go home for nearly  3 weeks and leave the Government un funded. We would be asking Federal  workers to work at their jobs for a pe riod of 1 month and not pay them, if  you can imagine that, while we being  fully paid would go back to our dis tricts.  I agree with the gentleman from Vir ginia [Mr. WOLF] and the gentlewoman  from Maryland  [Mrs. MORELLA], who  just  talked. While we vacation back  home, we would be  asking Federal  workers  to work without pay.  It is  wrong, it would be a disgrace, it would  send a signal to the American people,  let them eat cake. I will oppose it, Mr.  Speaker.  SIGNS OF OUR TIMES  (Mr. GUTIERREZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  GUTIERREZ.

29,House,104,-0.494,201,1,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  distinguished  gen tleman from Colorado [Mr. SKAGGS].  ",1996
30,House,104,-0.355,201,1,Mr. SKAGGS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker,  there are more  than  sufficient reasons for both the Presi dent's veto and for our sustaining it.  But I think it is especially important  to explain why this is not about re opening the part of Government funded  in this bill. The  illogic of the argu ments that have been offered on this  point is profound, if not comic. Here is  how it goes.  First, let us dillydally for months on  even getting this bill to the floor of the  House of Representatives, having wast ed months and months on extraneous  business at the first part of the first  session of this Congress. That is what  happened on this bill.  Second, then let us yield control of  much of the substance of the bill in  conference  to some of  the most ex treme anti-environmental  forces and  have it rejected, not once but twice,  taking additional weeks, not because of  the President of the United States but  because moderate Members of the ma jority party could not swallow the fis cal and environmental outrages in this  bill. That is what happened.  Third, then let us waste several more  weeks before finally getting a bill to  the House that could pass. That is what  happened on this bill.  And,  fourth, we  then  end up  21/2  months into the fiscal year, 2112 months  late, 2112 months of irresponsible failure  by the majority party to manage the  most basic business of the Congress.  That is what happened on this bill.  Fifth, we  then wait another month  after that, 31/2 months into the fiscal  year, 3112 months  late, 31/2 months of  failure by the majority to manage the  business of  the House, and  then we  bring up a veto override and have the  temerity  to  suggest  that  it  is  the  President's fault for the circumstances  that we are in? Give me a break.  An absolutely astounding, stunning  act of political chutzpah,  to suggest  that having failed in our responsibil ities for 31h months to take care of the  people of America, funding critical nat ural resource management responsibil ity, then to suggest that it is the Presi dent's fault,  that he  is somehow re sponsible  for  these unfortunate  cir cumstances. It makes no sense. Truly  an amazing act of political illogic.  This partial closure is in fact the in tended effect of the Speaker's delib erate decision cymcally to use the ma jority's failure to get its work done on  appropriations bills to leverage conces sions on other budget matters on which  the American public and their Presi dent simply disagree with the extreme  views of many in the majority party.  We are  in  this  fix because of the  Speaker's refusal and no other reason.  ",1996

32,House,104,0.419,201,1,Mr. PACKARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  urge my colleagues  to override  the  President's veto of the Interior appro priations bill. For 20 days now, his veto  shut the American people out of the  Smithsonian Museums,  the national  parks such as the Grand Canyon, Yel lowstone, and in my district the Cleve land National Forest. These parks and  museums provide a quality of outdoor  life  and  experience  for millions  of  Americans.  (Mr.  I commend the gentleman from Ohio  [Mr. REGULA],  the chairman, and cer tainly there is no other chairman that  I know of that would write a more fair  and equitable bill than the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. REGULA], the chairman.  I commend him for his hard work in  crafting this spending bill for our Na tion's national parks, national forests,  public lands, and national wildlife ref uges during these times of budget con strain ts. The  Interior appropriations  bill provides similar operating funds as  in 1995, as we did previously, for na tional parks and monuments.  We will later today take up legisla tion to allow State employees to volun tarily operate our national parks.  I  also support this legislation. But this  bill, overriding the President's veto, is  the much better long-range solution to  the problem.  One hundred thirty thousand Federal  employees are  furloughed because of  the President's veto of this bill. These  people deserve to be back to work, al lowing our national parks and forests  and cultural institutions to be open.  I urge my colleagues to override the  President's veto and support this bill.  ",1996
33,House,104,-0.656,201,1,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, the Re publican gentleman  from Ohio  REGULA] has offered a motion to dis charge from committee the Interior ap propriations bill that has been vetoed  by the President. Normally the com mittee would go  to work,  take  into  consideration  the  reasons  the Presi dent gave for his veto, reasonable pol icymakers would make the necessary  adjustments, and pass  the appropria tion.  Now  the Republicans are  trying to  find a way to look better. They have  simply created a mess, not only on this  bill but on the budget in general. The  Republican caucus has been led by the  freshman class, that group which has  the  least experience  in  the manage ment of government.  The Republicans have gone too far.  The Republicans have stepped way over  the  line. They have  jeopardized not  only the National Park Service in this  bill, they have jeopardized Federal em ployees and veterans' services, prison  security, passport services, and Social  Security services.  Time and time again we heard that  they were willing to shut this Govern ment down,  that they would do  this,  and this is what they are doing. Just  yesterday they voted in the Committee  on Rules to allow the Speaker to recess  in 3-day intervals. They are planning  to go home.  that Committee on  Rules.

Just the other day the  President comes on national television,  and the first item he mentioned as part  of the shutdown was Meals on Wheels.  My wife devotes 1 full day a week plus  other free time to Meals on Wheels in  the private sector. I picked up the tele phone today and I called every place I  could think of in southwest Missouri,  my district, and every meal is being de livered. Meals on Wheels has not been  shut down.  Now, maybe there is a Government  function  that  they  call Meals  on  Wheels that is Government funded that  is shut down. But  the private-sector  Meals on Wheels is delivering meals all  over the United States, which is a real  good example that the private sector  can do a better job than the Govern ment.  Meals on Wheels are being delivered,  and  I  resent  the President  of  the  United States stating that my wife's  volunteer work is not happening.

35,House,104,-0.302,214,1,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. Speaker, the fact is  that while Meals on Wheels are being  delivered now,  they will not if we do  not pass the Dole continuing spending  bill.  Mr. Speaker, politics is  the art of  compromise. Politics should not be the  tactics of terrorism. Terrorism is when  you  take  innocent hostages,  punish  them to achieve an objective that you  cannot otherwise achieve through legal  and democratic processes.  Federal employees, public civil serv ants,  are  being  taken hostage,  are  being punished  through no  fault of  their own, only because they choose to  serve  the American public  and  the  American civil service. They are being  punished, some having to work without  pay, others being locked out of their  jobs, being told it is illegal even to vol unteer.  Now, three-quarters of a million Fed eral employees will not be able to pay  for their rent, will not be able to even  provide food  for  their families. It is  wrong. Shame on this body.

36,House,104,0.559,214,1,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, I will be  willing to admit that it is unfortunate  that Federal employees are being fur loughed in this great debate. But they  are not the only hostages. They are not  the only innocent ones.  There are  several hundred million  people  in  this country who are held  hostage by  this whole process. The  most  innocent are our children and  grandchildren, who are inheriting from  this body a $5  trillion debt that will  cost them in their lifetime, if they are  born this year, $187,000 just to pay in terest on the debt.  This is a great debate. It is not a  sandbox fight. It is about the direction  of the Government. The dollar amounts  are insignificant. What the President  cannot tolerate is turning back to indi viduals  the  right  to make decisions  about their own lives. The nanny state  will wither away and the left will lose  control over the lives of people. That is  what this debate is about and I am on  the side of the innocent children and  grandchildren.

37,House,104,-0.459,214,1,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker, both  Democrats  and Republicans  on  the  Senate side were responsible in enact ing a clean CR to put the Government  back to work again. We have now been  in a Government shutdown for some 20  days which is costing this Government  at least $20 million each day. Twenty  days of that, we just need to multiply  that.  But, more importantly, it is costing  the taxpayer their services that they  deserve. Our country deserves better.  Yet there are those on the other side,  under the rubric of being responsible to  their grandchildren and  to  the chil dren,  the innocent, and denying chil dren of today opportunities.  How responsible is it for us to say  that we should deny the opportunity  and  the  responsibility  for people  to  productively give back to their country  what they will be pa.id? How respon sible is it for us to pay people who are  not actually working? It certainly is  not responsible, nor is it civil, to deny  the responsibility of us as Members of  this Congress.  ",1996
38,House,104,0.409,214,1,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. Speaker, a  rela tionship, to work and survive, has got  to be honest and we have got to deal  with each other in good faith. For a  government to govern well, we have to  be honest and we have  to deal with  each other in good faith.  The President has vetoed every meas ure we have sent to him that would  balance the budget. He has a constitu tional right to do that. If he believes  that our budget devastates the elderly,  he has a moral obligation to fight us. I  will never, never say bad things about  somebody that follows their beliefs be cause  that  is what  they  should do.  There comes a  time, though, that one  has an obligation to do more than just  say no.  Mr. President, if you do not like our  view of a balanced budget, give us your  view. We cannot negotiate against our selves anymore. You have a legal and a  moral obligation to fight us when you  think we are wrong. You have a legal  and moral obligation  to  fulfill your  commitment you made 40 days ago to  put a budget on  the  table  that bal ances. Please fulfill your obligation.  LEGISLATION PROHIBITING OVER SEAS  TRAVEL  BY  MEMBERS  DURING  GOVERNMENT  SHUT DOWN  (Mr. BARRETT of Wisconsin asked  and was given permission  to address  the House for 1 minute.)  ",1996
39,House,104,-0.38,214,1,Mr. BARRETT of Wisconsin.," Mr.  Speaker, last week I noticed a news paper account that said that notwith standing the fact that there are over  700,000 Federal employees who are not  being paid, there are still 50 Members  of Congress, nearly 50 Members of Con gress, who were scheduled to go on for eign trips during this shutdown.  Mr. Speaker, that is a slap in the face  to the hard working Federal employees  who want  to  be working  and who  should be pa.id. This is not the time for  Members of Congress to be  traveling  overseas. And  today the Speaker has  scheduled a piece of legislation that al lows us  to be  in recess  for up  to 3  weeks. That is wrong, too.  I  have  introduced  legislation  that  would prohibit Members of Congress  from traveling overseas during times of  Government furloughs. It is wrong, and  the Members of Congress should stay  here and we  should not  recess our selves. We should stay here, get these  people back  to work. They want  to  work. They should be working. It is  simply wrong to do what this Govern ment has done.

ONE TRILLION DOLLARS MORE IS  TOO MUCH  ",1996
41,House,104,0.449,227,1,Mr. TIAHRT.," Mr. Speaker, I  think  that the Dole campaign is going to be  very pleased with all of the support he  is getting from across the aisle in the  Democrat Party. I hope they will at tend the fundraisers and help Senator  DOLE gain the Presidency of the United  States, because I  think he  is a good  leader, which  is demonstrated  right  here by the support that he is getting  from the Democrat party.  Although  I currently disagree with  the policy he has on this continuing  resolution,  I still see him as a  fine  leader, and the type of man that I want  for President of the United States; and  I am glad to see many of the members  of the Democrat Party on the other  side of the aisle join with us in their  support for Majority Leader DOLE over  President Clinton on this.  I want to move on to something else,  though, because I am really wondering  how long the President is going to tol erate what is going on. I am wondering  how long Congress is going to tolerate  what is going on. I am wondering how  long the American people are going to  tolerate what is going on, even though  we are finally talking about a balanced  budget.  Now, we have been talking about a  balanced budget a  long time here  in  Congress. Ever since the 104th Congress  has been going on, we have been very  specifically targeting a balanced budg et that would take 7 years to achieve.  But now we are seeing a very drama.tic  change. The President is talking about  it; even the liberals here in Congress  are talking about it. But the President  still wants  to spend Sl  trillion more  than Congress  over  the next 7 years  does, $1 trillion.  Now, that is a lot of money. To give  you some kind of an idea how much  money it is, if you were to have gone in  business the day after Christ rose from  the dead and you lost $1 million that  day and every day up until today, al most 2,000 years, you would only be  about 80 percent of the way to losing Sl  trillion. That is only $800 billion that  you would have lost.  One trillion dollars is a lot of money,  and that is what the President wants  to spend over what Congress has put in  their budget. Do you ever wonder why?  There are some liberal organizations  the President obviously supports that  do not have the support of the majority  of this Congress, like the national bu reaucracy for  the Education Associa tion, our current welfare bureaucracy.  We here in Congress would like to send  the solution or the money closer to the  problems and let the States deal with  it. They are doing it very well in the  State of Kansas where I come from,  and  I  have  confidence  in Governor  Graves and Rochelle Chronister,  the  Secretary of Rehabilitation Services.  They are doing a very good job.  What we have seen here is something  very ineffective. Particularly agencies  like  the Department of Energy have  been horribly mismanaged. Secretary  O'Leary, the Secretary of the Depart ment of Energy, has become a  focal  point because of her travel, but this is  just the tip of the iceberg.  It started last year when we were  looking at different agencies. The Gen eral Accounting Office said that the  Department of Energy was ineffective  as a Cabinet-level agency. Vice Presi dent GoRE in his National Performance  Review said that they were 40 percent  ineffective in the environmental man agement area, and it was going to cost  taxpayers $70 billion over the next 30  years unless we do something about it.  Then we found out about the public  relations office. The Department of En ergy hires over 500 public relations em ployees at a cost of about S25 million to  taxpayers. Secretary O'Leary has  a  personal media  consultant  that  she  hires. She has even hired a private in vestigative firm to develop a list of un favorable  reporters and Congressmen  so that she can ""work on these people  a little.""  Let us focus a little bit on her travel,  because today in the Subcommittee on  General Oversight and Investigations,  we found out that Secretary O'Leary  has taken over 100 domestic and inter national trips. Now, some of this travel  is needed, particularly in the domestic  area, because that is where  the Sec retary of Energy's responsibilities lie.  But the international travel, 16 trips,  are outside the scope of her require ments as Secretary of the Department  of Energy.  The GAO, the General Accounting Of fice,  looked at two specific trips. One  was to South Africa and one was  to  India. Now,  this  is  reported  in  the  Washington Times today. The trip to  South Africa included 135 persons, 63  from the Department of Energy and 72  from the business and academic areas.  It cost  taxpayers  about Sl million,  Sl,860,000, over Sl million.  The second trip to India had 37 people  from the Government and 41 guests. It  cost $729,000. One of  the  interesting  things about this is that according to  Chairman BARTON from Texas, the De partment of Energy charged these non DOE visitors,  these guests, $2,800  for  coach fare on this, but the actual cost  to taxpayers was $12,860.  So who  is going  to make up  that  $10,000? Well, the taxpayers are making  it up, and I think it is kind of a sad  state of affairs.  Second, we found out that Secretary  O'Leary has transferred $400,000 from a  nuclear weapons-related account over  to her travel budget so she can make  these trips.  What it all boils down to, Mr. Speak er, is that we must balance the budget.  We must remove Secretary O'Leary; we  must eliminate the Department of En ergy as a Cabinet-level agency. Let us  get the Government back to work, cull  the deadwood out by eliminating the  Department of Energy.  FRESHMEN NOT READY TO LEAD  ",1996
42,House,104,-0.233,240,1,Mr. HOLDEN.," Mr. Speaker, the time  has come in this Chamber for action.  Senator DOLE summed it up absolutely  correct when  he  said  in  the other  Chamber, ""Enough is enough,"" as he  guided a continuing resolution through  the other Chamber that opened up the  Federal Government.  We need to do the same thing in this  Chamber.  I have thousands of Federal employ ees in my district, in the Social Secu rity Administration, in the Veterans'  Administration, at Federal prisons, at  Minersville, Lewisburg, and Allenwood  who are either on a  furlough, or who  are being forced to work extra hours,  an extra shift, and not being paid. It is  not right to use Federal employees as  pawns in this game in this whole budg et debate.  0 1730  So I say to my colleagues, let us pass  a continuing resolution and let us con tinue  this debate  on balancing  the  budget.  I say to my colleagues on the other  side, I want to work with you. I want  to work with you  in balancing  the  budget in 7 years using CBO numbers,  and we can do that. The framework for  doing that is already in place. We need  to continue the dialog and have a give and-take process.  If you look at the coalition budget  that was offered in this House, it bal anced the budget in 7 years and had no  tax cuts. I say to you that is a frame work. We can work with that and we  can balance the budget. You look at  the budget that passed this House and  we had $245 billion in tax breaks in  that. To me, that is personally unac ceptable; it is too large. But I am will ing to go halfway and meet my friend  on the other side in moving toward bal ancing the budget.  ",1996
43,House,104,0.536,253,1,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.," Mr. Speak er, in 1993, President Clinton and the  Democrat-controlled  103d  Congress  thought they could reduce or end the  Government's deficit by passage of the  President's budget bill. That bill dra matically increased taxes on working  Americans, but it will not end the defi cit or balance the budget.  President Clinton was wrong. He has  even admitted publicly he was wrong  to have raised taxes. But his actions  have not matched his words. President  Clinton  vetoed  the  congressionally  passed Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would  have balanced the Federal budget in 7  years while reducing taxes on working  Americans. The bill would have saved  Medicare  from bankruptcy  and pre served this vital health care program  for our Nation's senior citizens, and  the bill would have reformed the wel fare system that has created a genera tion of Americans trapped in poverty  and dependent on Government hand outs.  President Clinton also vetoed several  appropriation bills,  including the De partments of Justice, State, and Com merce,  and  others.  The  President  closed the doors of many Federal Agen cies and Departments. The President  has idled thousands of Federal workers,  and the President has inconvenienced  millions of Americans who are trying  to secure home mortgage loans, pass ports,  financial aid and other impor tant Government services.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Presi dent to go beyond just an admission he  was wrong. It is time for the President  to stop the political rhetoric and ac cept common sense reform.  Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying  that goes like this: ""A wise man will  change his mind,  but  a  fool  never  does.""  In  the current debate,  it re mains to be seen who will or will not  change their mind.  The President and the 103d Congress  passed a budget bill that raised taxes  on working Americans in an effort to  lower the deficit and balance the budg et. It did not work. That can be seen in  the fact  that today we are spending  $500 million-a-day more than we  take  in in taxes and revenues. Yet the Presi dent has refused to change his mind  and consider a new course, a  course  that will provide a balanced budget by  the year 2002.  The President and the 103d Congress  initiated  the  COPS  Program.  The  President's program promised to lower  crime rates and make our streets safer  by providing Federal  funds  to State  and local governments to hire 100,000  more police officers. Two years later,  less than a third of the new police offi cers promised by the President are on  our Nation's streets, and when the Fed eral funds run out, the State and local  governments will have to foot the bill  for these new officers. The President's  plan is costly. It is another unfunded  Federal mandate forced on the backs of  States and  local governments. This,  too, is clearly a failed policy, and again  the President has refused to change his  mind and consider a new course.  Republicans in the Congress passed  an appropriations bill for the Depart ment of Justice. That bill provided  some $2 billion in trust fund money for  State and local law enforcement block  grants. Those funds would have been  used to employ additional law enforce ment officers; those funds would have  provided  additional  compensation,  equipment, or other necessary mate rials related to basic law enforcement  services. Those funds would have en hanced  security measures  in  and  around our schools, and  those  funds  would  have  established multijuris dictional  task forces, particularly in  rural areas that work with Federal of ficials  for crime prevention and con trol.  Mr. Speaker, in short, that bill would  have done what  the President's bill  failed  to do. The bill would have re turned money and decisionmaking to  local  police  departments.  The  bill  would have allowed them to make deci sions on how to reduce crime in their  communities, but again the President  has refused to change his mind over a  failed policy. He vetoed that bill.  There is another old saying that you  can fool some of the people some of the  time but you cannot fool all of the peo ple all of the time.  The American people are not fooled  by the press conferences and political  rhetoric being put forth by the Presi dent. Every day that this impasse con tinues, the public becomes more angry  at the President and the Congress.  In December, the public was leaning  towards placing blame at the feet of  Congress. Now, however, the American  people are dividing the blame between  the President and the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, often political leaders  will govern by poll numbers. The Presi dent peaked and missed his highwater  mark in the polls by 3 days. With the  President's failure to agree on a bal anced budget concept that we as a Con gress could have voted on  this past  Wednesday, it is now apparent to the  public that the President is not sincere  about balancing the budget.  This  is not a  situation where  the  President is winning or losing some po litical game. There are no points to be  scored here. From now on, everybody  loses.  Mr. Speaker, I say again, it is time  for the President to stop the political  rhetoric and accept commonsense re form.  THE EFFECTS OF FURLOUGHING  GOVERNMENT WORKERS  ",1996

45,Senate,104,0.322,292,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  time has been reserved.  President,  today we will  be  awaiting a possible House action on  maybe one or two measures on return ing Federal workers and also paying  Federal workers who have not been  leaders'  We do not expect rollcall votes to  occur during today's session. We do not  know precisely what the form of the  legislation will be when it comes from  the House. We hope to be able to pass  it by unanimous consent. So if anybody  wants to object, they ought to be let ting us know early because we will  have to give 24-hour notice to get our  colleagues back here sometime tomor row for that vote.  I know that some indicated that they  would have objected  to  the  last UC  while  they were  hundreds  of miles  away. So I want to be sure those people  who may be out and around the coun try today understand that there may  be another request  for a  unanimous  consent, and  if they wish  to object,  they had better hustle back here and  do so.  I hope, with  the House apparently  trying to come together on a couple of  proposals  that would enable Federal  workers to return to work with pay,  that we would not engage in rhetoric  here today that might discourage posi tive action by the House.  So  it would be my hope  that we  would dwell on other matters, if nec essary, and let the Senate then stand  in recess subject  to  the call of  the  Chair awaiting House action. I do not  think it is going to help anything if  some of our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle find it necessary  to  beat up House Republicans. It will only  make it more difficult, and it should  make it more difficult, frankly. So  hope we can avoid that rhetoric today.  I  ORDER FOR RECESS SUBJECT TO  THE CALL OF THE CHAIR  ",1996
46,Senate,104,0.262,292,1,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I again  wish to thank the distinguished major ity leader for his leadership throughout  this situation. I find a ray of encour agement here that Federal workers can  return to work with pay.  I want to state for the record that  the majority lead.er has stood steadfast  on seeing  that Federal workers who  have been  furloughed, and otherwise  their pay stopped, will receive this pay.  It  is an obligation of  the United  States of America and all citizens to  see  that  those who have contracted  with our Federal Government  to be  gainfully employed be compensated be cause they are in no way-absolutely  no way-at fault on this situation.

I do not know whether many of my  colleagues know  this, Mr. President,  but retired PHS commissioned officers  have not received their retirement pay  since our first continuing resolution  expired on December 15, 1995. While re tired members of  the Federal Civil  Service have thankfully been able  to  receive their retirement checks during  this time period, the benefits of retired  PHS  commissioned  officers  come  through  a  direct appropriation con tained  in  the Labor/HHS  appropria tions bill, a bill which we all know has  not yet been approved by this body.  The roughly 3,600 beneficiaries of this  program should not be victims of our  budget battles, Mr. President.

49,House,104,0.418,331,1,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speak er, what is the truth about the Govern ment shutdown? The truth is this. The  radical liberal left of the House of Rep resentatives have been obstructionists  for many, many years and  they are  continuing it this year, and in  this  coming year.  Mr. Clinton, in his second so-called  budget, wanted  to  slow  the  rate of  growth in Medicare, bring about tax re lief. That was greeted with, my good ness, this is terrible, this is awful, from  our friends across the aisle.  I wonder when the President talked  about extreme Republican freshmen if  he should not have looked at himself  when he was  talking about  the  tail  wagging the dog. Is he afraid he might  lose his base if he presents a balanced  budget and puts the Government back  to work?

The  new Prime Minister was  their  Trade Minister, Mr. Hashimoto. The  new Trade Minister is the Prime Min ister  for  one  major  reason: Mr.  Hashimoto beat back American de mands to open up Japanese markets.  The  Japanese  people  say  Hashimoto fights for Japanese work ers. Mr. Hashimoto  takes  care  of  Japan. Mr. Hashimoto will not cave in  to America.

Yet  he has refused to permit a clean resolu tion to continue the operation of the  Federal Government to come forward.

But, the fact is,  Mr. Speaker, balancing the budget is  not about numbers-it is about people.  People  like our children and grand children that will bear the burden of  today's  fiscal  irresponsibility.  It  is  about letting taxpayers keep more of  their hard-earned money. It is about  who can spend money better, the Fed eral Government or the American fam ily. It is about lower interest rates so  families can afford to buy a home and  live the American dream.

58,House,104,-0.472,357,1,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, the shutdown of  the Government has affected Americans all  to co across the country. The Federal government  should be predictable and certain, but due to  the inaction of this House under GOP leader ship,  the extreme accusations by some Re publicans of an incompetent Federal Govern ment are being made a self-fulfilling prophecy  by these same Republicans.  As just one good example, I have received  dozens of calls from railroad retirees  in Min nesota who  live on  fixed  incomes and have  had  their retirement benefits cut because of  the shutdown! In fact, the Railroad Retirement  Board has had  to cut January vested dual  benefit payments by 64% for 160,000 railroad  retirees across the Nation. This means that re tirees who  earned  their  pensions  through  many years of hard work and who  live on  fixed incomes are having trouble meeting their  rent payments. And of course there are no as surances  that they will  receive any of  their  benefits in the Mure if this shutdown contin ues.  The sad reality here  is that these retirees  are being denied the benefits they earned as  the Republicans play political games and shut down  the Government and shut out Federal  workers. This Congress ought  to do  its  job  and act today on a real continuing resolution  to keep the full Government running-and pro vide  the 160,000 railroad  retirees with  their  earned benefits.  This isn't about who is for a balanced budg et, rather it's how to balance the budget. Nor  is this shutdown about political honesty, in fact  the more some boast of their monopoly on  truth and honesty, the more firm you should  hold on to your wallet. We are thirteen weeks  into the fiscal year and have had four weeks  of Federal Government shutdown because of  GOP straw man arguments about economic  forecasts and games to seek political advan tage. This resolution finally provides some re lief but leaves many programs, and most im portantly the people we serve, in a lurch. Iron ically,  it pays Federal workers but ties  their  hands so  they can't do their jobs. As Mark  Twain stated, ""The more you explain it to me  the more I don't understand it''.  Mr. Speaker, it isn't the Federal Government  that's incompetent, rather it is the Republican led, know-it-all, arrogant Congress, which after  a year can't have its actions blamed on inex perience. No, the problem is indifference and  political one-ups-manship. Enough is enough.  Free the hostages and let the railroad retirees  have  their pensions. Put the American peo ple's Federal Government back to work-the  full Government, not this half-baked GOP po litical fig leaf designed more for political relief  and which will  just result  in more shutdown  threats and Federal Government uncertainty.

But let there be no mistake, Mr. Speaker:  This  legislation  is the most bizarre measure  said  this  that I have seen in 8 years as a Member of  Congress.

Everyone would be back on the job at the  Education Department, but there would be no  new student loans.  And for the many Federal contractors who  have been burned badly by this Government  shutdown, this measure offers no relief.

Mr. Speaker, I was going to lead off  with a  travelogue of the President of  the United States, but I think no one  might have cared. Then, second, I was  going to give a  travelogue of the Sec retary of Energy and realized we did  not have time. So I thought that it was  important to discuss this bill and not  anybody else's travelogues.  Mr. Speaker, it is important also to  understand that throughout this very  long first year of this change in direc tion of government for the first time in  60 years, we have passed seven appro priations bills, which encompass about  two-thirds of the funding of all govern ment activities. The  remaining one third of the funding of government ac tivities are covered by the remaining 6  appropriations bills. Three  of  them  were vetoed by the President and three  of them, admittedly, have not made  their way through the processes. It is  unfortunate,  but  they  are working  their way through.  Along the way, while we were all dis cussing the appropriations bills, we for got one thing: The House and the Sen ate and  the President of the United  States came to an agreement that we  should stop doing business as usual as  we have for 60 years, increasing spend ing,  regulation,  taxing,  big  govern ment,  and  centralization of govern ment in Washington. We agreed that  we should reverse the tide, and put this  country strongly on a footing toward a  balanced budget between now and the  year 2002,  as scored by  the Congres sional Budget Office.  Mr. Speaker,  the President of  the  United States agreed to that by virtue  of the joint resolution we passed on No vember 20. But unfortunately, while we  put our balanced budget plan on the  table and passed it through the House  and Senate, one that did really get the  country on even footing, the President  has never presented his. He has prom ised it, but he has never done it.  That is what brings us here  today,  Mr. Speaker. Yes,  the remaining one third of government has not been ade quately funded. Yes, this is a piecemeal  process  that causes us  to pick and  choose certain  i terns and rush  them  through without dealing with the rest  of the process. It is unfortunate.  But we have begun. We have begun to  tell the President of the United States  that business as usual, that promising  the people everything and delivering  absolutely nothing, is over, absolutely  over. And,  yes,  it was  unfortunate  many Federal employees were held out  of work and those that worked did not  get paid, but we resolved that today.  We  put Federal  employees back  to  work. We paid them for their lost pay,  and we are going to pay them prospec tively through January 26.  Mr. Speaker, we also passed targeted  appropriations  for  several  activities,  including Meals on Wheels and child  welfare, veterans benefits, and others.  Then we fallowed up that bill with an other bill that was reported out of the  Committee on Rules. The gentleman  from New York [Mr. SOLOMON], the dis tinguished chairman of the Committee  on Rules, and the gentleman from Cali fornia  [Mr. DREIER],  and all of  the  other members of the Committee on  Rules, reported to this floor just a few  hours ago which has passed a bill that  says  to  the President of the United  States, Mr. President,  if you  fulfill  your promise to give us that balanced  budget that you have been promising  for so long but never delivered, we will  put Government back  to work in its  entirety, in its entirety, through Janu ary 26, and by that time we will get all  the rest of it done.  But he has not yet done it. There is  a trigger. That bill is very, very impor tant, because it almost makes, at least  for  the next few weeks, what we are  about to do here superfluous.  But, we are saying in this bill we will  here  take a  number of activities  in  other bills not yet enacted, a number  of other functions of government that  have not yet been  funded,  that are  vital and critical to the United States  of America, and add them with the ear lier  targeted  list passed earlier  this  morning, so  that they will be funded  throughout the rest of this fiscal year.  Mr. Speaker,  I  have  to  ask  the  House's indulgence, because I want to  make sure that everyone knows. The  activities in this bill include funding  for the black lung program; the Medi care  contract  employees  program;  Medicare claims processing; surveys of  certification for nursing homes; Medic aid payments  to States;  funding  for  Gallaudet, elementary and secondary  schools; National Institutes of Health;  Centers for Disease Control; retirement  pay for Public Health Service commis sioned officers, and  trade adjustment  benefits.  Now, all of those items fall within  the Labor-HHS bill. There has been  criticism because that bill has not got ten all the way through Congress. But,  Mr. Speaker, let me remind you, at the  risk of being held out of order, that the  other body,  led by  the Democrats in  the other body, the minority party, has  filibustered  that  bill.  This  House  passed that bill in early August of this  last year. That bill got filibustered and  is filibustered to this very day by the  Democrats in the Senate. It is being  held hostage. All of the great programs  funded under that bill are being held  hostage. So it is incumbent upon us to  come forward and say there are impor tant programs in that bill that are not  funded, and we will fund them.  At what level, the gentleman says?  He  says he does not know at what  level. I will tell the gentleman. On NIB  it is funded at the House-passed bill  level. This is the same for the retire ment pay for Public Health Service of ficers. On all the rest, it is the lower of  the amount in the House-passed bill or  the last year's bill whichever is lower.  This bill also provides funding, be cause they are important programs, for  the Bureau of Indian Affairs tribal or ganization contracts, Bureau of Land  Management visitor services on public  lands, the Peace Corps, the State De partment diplomatic  security efforts  abroad, parts of the Small Business Ad ministration  financing,  the  Federal  Housing Administration loan process ing,  the FEMA emergency  food and  shelter programs,  the Department of  Justice Federal employee crime pro grams, all of the crime programs, in cluding  those done by  the FBI,  the  DEA, the Bureau of Prisons, U.S. At torneys and Marshalls Service and Or ganized Crime and Drug Enforcement  ",1996
68,,104,-0.487,487,1,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog nize the students, coaches,  faculty, and par ents who make up the 1995 California Inter scholastic Federal Southern Section Division I  Champion,  Bishop  Amat  Memorial  High  School football team.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  On December 9, 1995,  the Bishop Amat  Lancer  football  team defeated Loyola High  School in a 14 to 1 O win, earning the team its  latest in a string of Cl F Division  I champion ships before 14,000 fans at the Los Angeles  Coliseum.  This  year's Cl F Division  I championship  team: Andrew Woolsey, Joey Getherall, Kevin  Mclaurin, Daniel Bravo, Brendan McMillan,  David Bautista, Brian Russell, Gabriel Marichi,  Chris  Ulibarri,  Mike  Vermeeren,  David  Fuentes, Steve Levario, Sean Koelle, Ricky  Vargas, Andre Lake, Damon Catania, Chikoski  Bell, Ralph Brown  II, Chris Sabado, Breon  Ansley, Carlos Osorio, Booker Bell, Damon  Samuels, David Olivas, Mike Chavez Jeremy  Juarez, Emerson Santos,  Joaquin Tierney,  Raymond  Reyna,  Anthony  Chacon,  Abel  Montanez, Manuel Duran, Kyle Keene, Eric  Calderon, Santiago Vazquez, Trey Sorensen,  Frank Gonzalez, Kali Dawkins, Manuel Garcia,  Sam Galvan, Nate Sabado, Ruben Torres,  Yovany Lainez, Jesus Hernandez, Ron Villa,  Preston Wills, Joe Villa, Tom Gomez, Ernie  Fierro, Raul Ascencio, Brian Polak, Chris Mo rales,  Alex  Perez,  Jason  Marin,  Paul  Gonzales, Zino Hessing, David Fernandez,  Ray Martinez, Justyn Hayward, Mark Verti,  Doug  Knight,  Brian Adamek,  Luigi, Rao,  Manuel Porras, John Escalera, Xavier Gomez,  Kristopher Guillory,  Jerry  Lopez,  Anthony  Salazar, Jeremy Drake, Huber Ayala, John  Sheriff, Mike Diaz, and Jesus Lopez.  With the guidance and support of their fam ily, Bishop Amat faculty, and Principal, Mon signor Aidan M. Carroll, and Head Coach Tom  Salter and Assistant Coaches Glenn Martinez,  Mike Difiori, Bill Mulvehill, Richard Ecalera,  Stephan Pace, Dechon Burns, Pat Escalera,  and Joe O'Connor, the Lancer football  team  proved that Bishop Amat is a formidable com petitor.  This year's championship makes  the  fifth  time Bishop Amat has successfully brought  home  the CIF Southern Section Division  I  Championship and their first since 1992. The  dedication and commitment demonstrated by  these  students  is  commendable and note worthy. Their practice  required many  long  hours, whle maintaining  the high academic  standards demanded of Bishop Amat  stu dents, in preparation for their 14-game cham pionship season.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is with pride  that  I rise  to  recognize these exceptional students, coach es, and parents.  I ask my colleagues to join  me in saluting these accomplished individuals  and in extending our congratulations and best  wishes  for their continued success and com mitment to excellence.  VA EDUCATION 2-YEAR RULE  MODIFICATION  HON. BOB SfUMP  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 5, 1996  ",1996
69,,104,0.703,487,1,Mr. STUMP.," Mr. Speaker, today I introduce  H.R. 2851  to amend  title 38, U.S. Code  to  modify the Department of Veterans Affair's GI  bill's 2-year rule to allow easier access for vet erans to institutions of higher learning.  485  The proposed bill waives the current 2-year  operating rule for branch campuses of public  or  other  tax-supported  institutions.  It  also  waives the rule  for proprietary profit or non profit educational institutions where the branch  and parent institution have been in operation  for 2 years.  The 2-year rule is an important qualification  for schools.  In ensures that only quality edu cational institutions and courses are offered to  our Nation's veterans. The rule was originated  after World War  II and  resurfaced after  the  Vietnam war to negate the impact fly-by-night  operations  that preyed on  veterans, bilking  them of their educational benefits.  As a  result, veterans did not  receive  the  education and  the  training  they needed and  for which the citizens of this country paid with  their taxes.  Today, the situation has changed substan tially. While we recognize that some low-qual ity and  fly-by-night organizations clearly still  exist, the majority of for-profit education insti tutions  offering meaningful,  quality  course work. They have default rates well below the  Department of Education's standards for con tinued operation and they are continually mon itored for the VA by the State approving agen cies.  This proposed legislation does not alter the  stringent requirements already in place man dating  that  the  institutions must be degree  granting, and be recognized by a Department  of Veterans Affairs-affiliated accrediting agen cy. The institution must be also be licensed by  the State in which it operates.  Allowing participation by veterans on new  branch campuses of already proven  institu tions gives necessary  flexibility  to  veteran  beneficiaries of the Montgomery GI bill and I  urge its passage.  WEST  VIRGINIANS  SUPPORT  HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRON MENTAL PROTECTIONS  HON. NICK J. RAHAil Il  OF WEST VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 5, 1996  ",1996
70,,104,-0.306,487,1,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, during  the  first  session of  this Congress, West Virginians  were subjected to a legislative assault of un precedented proportions as proposal after pro posal was advanced by the Republican major ity  to gut virtually every major environmental,  health, and safety law.  From the standpoint of coalfield citizens in  particular, 1995 was a year to remember. The  protections coal miners receive from the Mine  Safety and Health Administration came under  siege by one Republican legislative proposal.  The health care miners obtain from black lung  clinics may no  longer exist as a result of the  Labor, HHS, and Education appropriation bill.  The pensions and health care unionized coal  miners receive continue to jeopardized by an other Republican  legislative  proposal.  The  ability of coal miners to obtain black lung ben efits was  threatened by reductions  in appro priations that may give rise  to the closure of  ",1996
71,Senate,104,-0.301,500,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, as he  had indicated he would do,  the Presi dent has now vetoed H.R. 4,  the Per sonal Responsibility and Work Oppor tunity Act of 1995. As  the bill passed  the Senate, December 22, 1995, with a  margin of only 5 votes, 52-47, there can  be  no  question  of a  veto  override.  Hence, the judgment of Robert Pear of  the New York Times that ""The Presi dent's action concludes a 4-year drama  that began when Mr. Clinton, as a  Presidential candidate  in 1992, prom ised to 'end welfare as we know it.'""  Last September 19,  essentially  the  same bill,  indeed H.R. 4,  passed  the  Senate 87-12, with only 11 Democrats  opposed.  In  the  interval  Elizabeth  Shogren of the Los Angeles Times and  Judith Havemann and Ann Devroy of  the Washington Post reported that the  Department  of Health  and Human  Services had submitted an analysis of  the bill  to  the White House. Owing  largely  to  the 5-year  time  limit,  it  would throw some 1.5 million children  into poverty. No one could have wished  this, and Democrats were especially  bound to take into account this assess ment of a Democratic administration.  And so, in the end, 45 of 46 Democrats  voted against the measure, Republican  Senators  CAMPBELL  and  joined us.  On the day of the final Senate vote,  the 11 Democratic Senators who had  been opposed  from  the  first, wrote  President Clinton to warn against in cluding any  ""broad welfare measure  in  the  end  of  session budget  agreement."" This was not something,  we judged, to be concluded in a matter  of days by a small group under great  pressure.  However, we now learn that on Sat urday, January 6, as part of a balanced  budget proposal offered by the Presi dent in those talks, a section ""Welfare  Reform Savings""-$46 billion over 7  years-includes this:  HATFIELD  * * *  Cash Assistance: AFDC would be  termi nated and replaced by a new conditional en titlement of limited duration. There would  be a 5-year maximum time limit with a state  option for vouchers at the end of that period  to assist children.  Thus,  the administration seemingly  proposes to deliver the same 1.5 million  children into poverty.  Why is this happening? I can think of  two partial explanations.  First,  it  is widely  assumed  that  AFDC  is a Federal entitlement that  the Federal Government can restrain  without relinquishing. It is not. There  ",1996
72,Senate,104,-0.267,513,1,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I would  like to just briefly, today, talk about  two Americans I wanted to bring to the  attention of my colleagues, two heroes  of mine.  I never met them. I talked to one fel low on the phone the other day. A fel low named Robert Naegele and his wife  Ellis. He  started  a  company  called  Rollerblade, which  some may know  about,  the largest in-line skate com pany in America. It was a story I read  in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, when  I  traveled  through Minneapolis  the  other day by plane.  Robert Naegele sold his company 2  months ago. He apparently made an  enormous amount of money, ran the  company,  started  it  from  scratch,  brought it to a $250 million company  and then sold it a couple months ago.  Then, about a week before Christmas,  280 employees of this company began to  get  letters  in  the mail  from Mr.  Naegele and his wife. It turns out he  decided to give the people who worked  for  that company,  the people  in  the  factories,  the people who made  the  skates that made him a very wealthy  man, a Christmas bonus equal to $160 a  month for every month these folks had  worked for the company.  For some of them in the factory who  had been  there all  the  time he was  there it meant up to $20,000, a $20,000  check. Do you know what he had done?  He and his wife had prepaid the income  taxes, so when these folks opened up  this check,  totally unexpected,  from  someone who no longer owned the com pany, they got a check that was tax  free.  What this man was saying to them  was ""you mattered."" You people who  worked in the plant and factories and  helped make  these products, you are  the ones who made me successful. You  made me some money and I want to  share it with you. What a remarkable  story. What a hero.  This guy  is out of step with  the  CEO's in our country who now say the  way to the future is to downsize and  lay off and decide to cut the ground out  from under the feet of people who work  for a company for 20 years. This fellow  says to a factory worker, who the arti cle  describes-as  their  families  are  weeping with joy about this unexpected  benevolence  they  received  in  the  mail-he says, you matter to me. You  made a difference. You made this com pany successful and I want to share it  with you.  What a remarkable man. It seems to  me if more CEO's in this country would  understand what Mr. Naegele under stands, this country would be a better  place. Our companies could be better  able to compete. You would have more  loyalty, more  job security for people  who have spent 10 and 20 years invest ing their time in companies.  I read this one day. The next day I  read another piece.  It was about a fellow whose company,  on December 11, began to burn down it was in a small town in Massachu setts-a man named Aaron Feuerstein.  He was about to go to his 70th birthday  party, a surprise party that was being  thrown for him. He learned a boiler had  exploded at his mill, textile plant, set ting off a fire. It injured 27 people and  destroyed  three of the factory's cen tury-old buildings. That employs 2,400  people  in an economically depressed  area.  The people who watched that mill  burn felt that they were  losing their  jobs, and losing their future.  When Feuerstein  arrived  to  assess  the  damage  to a business his grandfather had  started 90 years ago, he kept himself from  crying by thinking back to the passage from  King Lear  in which Lear promises not to  weep even  though his heart would ""break  into a hundred thousand flaws."" ""I was tell ing myself! have to be creative .... ""  And 3 days later:  On  the night of Dec. 14, more than 1,000  employees gathered in the gym of Central  Catholic High School  to  learn  the fate of  their jobs and of the cities of Methuen and  Lawrence. Feuerstein entered the gym from  the back, and as he shook the snow off his  coat, the murmurs turned to cheers. The fac tory owner, who had already given out $275  Christmas bonuses and pledged to rebuild,  walked to the podium. ""I will get right to  my announcement,"" he said. ""For the next  30 days-and it might be more-all our em ployees will be paid their full salaries. But  over and above the money, the most impor tant thing Malden Mills can do for our work ers is to get you back to work. By Jan. 2, we  will restart operations, and within 90 days  we will be fully operational.""  True to his word, Feuerstein has continued  to pay his employees in full, at a cost of  some Sl.5 million a week and at an average  of $12.50 an hour-already one of the highest  textile wages in the world. And even better  than his word, Malden Mills was up and run ning last week at 80% of its Polartec capac ity, thanks to round-the-clock salvage work  and  the purchase of 15 new machines. ""I  haven't  really  done  anything,""  says  Feuerstein.  ""I don't deserve  credit. Cor porate America has made it so that when  you behave the way I did, it's abnormal.""  I  just want to finally mention that  these  two men, Robert Naegele, and  Aaron Feuerstein, I think are heroes. I  think both recognize what a lot of this  country have forgotten. A company is  its workers. Yes. It is its investors, it  is its innovators, it is its scientists,  and  it  is also  its workers. Workers  matter, and  these heroes have done  what more American business leaders  should do. Too many American busi nesses now say to those workers, ""You  are like a wrench. We use it, and we get  rid of you when it is over.""  What these people are saying is the  workers are their business. They deter mine whether that business is success ful. And both of them have said we  commit ourselves to you workers. And  I say to them that they are American  heroes  to me, and I wish there were  more like them in this country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have these two articles printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the articles  were  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune]  IT WAS A SURPRISINGLY GREEN CHRISTMAS  FOR ROLLERBLADE EMPLOYEES  (By Dee DePass)  Two weeks ago Rollerblade employee Ann  Reader, six months pregnant with her third  child, called her husband, Tim, from work  sobbing. He immediately thought the worst,  she said.  But it was good news for Reader and all of  Rollerblade's 280 employees. Former Roller blade co-owner Robert Naegele and his wife,  Ellis, played Santa over the holidays, giving  each of Rollerblade's employees thousands of  dollars in tax-free money, figured at about  $160 for each month of service with the com pany. Sources familiar with the giveaway es timated the combined gifts to be Sl.5 mil lion.  Reader,  team  programs manager,  has  worked there for more than six years-mak ing her check worth more than Sll,000. None  of the employees contacted would confirm  the amount of their checks.  ""It made me cry,"" said Reader in a shaky  voice. ""I think it was so generous of them. It  was an amazing gesture.""  Rollerblade spokesperson Deborah Autrey  said, ""It was a complete surprise that came  out of the blue. People were laughing and  crying and hugging. I have never seen people  in such a stupor.""  Autrey has worked at Rollerblade for four  years. More than half of the employees are  warehouse workers with most  receiving  hourly wages.  Naegele, who was chairman during the phe nomenal  growth  of  the 15-year-old  firm,  could not be  reached  for  comment. Two  months ago he sold his 50 percent share of  Rollerblade to Nordica Inc. of Italy for an  undisclosed amount. He bought 50 percent of  the in-line skate company in 1985, when sales  were only $500,000. Sales in 1994 were $265  million.  In Christmas cards to employees, Naegele  wrote that he had reaped great rewards from  his Rollerblade  investment because of the  employees' hard work and that he wanted to  ",1996

But yes terday, my colleague from Texas,  the  majority leader, Mr. ARMEY, said that  default on the debt was again a threat,  right here on the front page of the New  York Times and on every paper across  this country.  Mr. Speaker, I guess it is a case of  dumb and dumber. It was dumb to shut  down the Government; it is dumber to  default on the debt of the Government.  My Republican friends say we are doing  this budget  that cuts Medicare and  Medicaid to do it for our children and  our grandchildren. But the Republican  plan  is  to hurt homeowners and  to  leave our children and grandchildren  with a mountain of bad debt.

77,Senate,104,-0.352,1137,1,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, after the  devastation of a mill fire in Methuen,  MA,  threatened  the community and  2,400 workers who  depended  on  it,  Aaron Feuerstein could have turned his  back on his employees and closed the  factory or moved it out of State. But  he chose to stay. He chose to help, and  to give something back to those who  worked for him. He offered to pay ev eryone, and he even gave his employees  their Christmas bonuses, will pay their  health care premiums for 90 days, and  is working to open the factory again as  soon as possible.  Mr. President, Aaron Feuerstein's ex traordinary generosity during this hol iday season has moved Massachusetts  and the Nation, and made all of us be lieve again in the power of community  and the real spirit of America. What he  has done to help so many families will  never be forgotten, and I know that my  colleagues  in  the Senate  join me  in  congratulating him for setting an ex ample of loyalty, leadership, and com passion which is too often lacking in  contemporary American society.  He has shown us what true success in  business  is all about,  and what our  economy is all about. It's about help ing people and families to prosper and  to grow  together-build together and  work together toward a common goal.  The news reports of the reactions of  Aaron's workers to his generosity are  heart.w~rming; and the warm response  of his .,loyal employees is a  tribute to  him and should be the greatest holiday  gift anyone could receive.  Mr. President, Aaron Feuerstein has  earned a  special place in our hearts,  and has set a new standard for Amer ican corporate leadership.  I have joined with the distinguished  senior Senator from Massachusetts and  the Massachusetts congressional dele gation in pledging to do what we can,  at the Federal level, to help this fac tory and community recover from this  catastrophic fire, and I know that my  colleagues in the Senate will join me in  congratulating  Aaron  for  showing  America that loyalty is an essential in gredient not only in business but in the  life of a community.  Mr. President,  I ask  that a  recent  editorial  from  the Boston Globe by  David Nyhan about the generosity of  Aaron Feuerstein be printed  in  the  RECORD.  The editorial follows:  THE MENSCH WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS  (By David Nyhan)  Were it not for the 45-mile-an-hour winds  ripping out of the Northwest, the sparks that  they  carried  and  the  destruction  they  wrought, Aaron Feuerstein today would be  just another rich guy who owned a one-time  factory, in a country full of the same.  But the fire that destroyed New England's  largest textile operation Monday has turned  this 70-year-old  businessman  into  a  folk  hero. If a slim, determined, devoutly-Jewish  textile manufacturer can be Santa Claus,  then Feuerstein is,  to 2,400 workers whose  jobs were jeopardized by the fire.  The flames, so intense and widespread that  the smoke plume appeared in garish color on  TV weathermen's  radar maps,  presented  Feuerstein with a stark choice: Should he re build, or take the insurance money and bag  it?  Aaron Feuerstein is keeping the paychecks  coming, as best he can, for as long as pos sible, while he rushes to rebuild, and restore  the jobs a whole valley-full of families de pend upon.  Everybody got paid this week. Everybody  got their Christmas bonus. Everybody will  get  paid  at  least  another month. And  Feuerstein will  see what he can do after  that. But the greatest news of all is that he  will rebuild the factory.  The man has a biblical approach  to the  complexities of late-20th-century economics,  capsulated by a Jewish precept:  ""When all is moral chaos, this is the time  for you to be a mensch.""  In Yiddish, a mensch is someone who does  the right thing. The Aaron Feuerstein thing.  ",1996

79,House,104,0.416,1163,1,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, in clos ing, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to emphasize  as strongly as I know how that this bill  is on  the floor today not because  the  Republican majority wants to stuff it  down the minority's throats. Quite the  contrary, this bill is on the floor today  because our Democrat colleagues are  the ones who have provided the leader ship to get this moving.  Indeed, as we mentioned at the start  of this debate,  it has been  the gen tleman  from California  [Mr. CONDIT],  the gentleman  from California  [Mr.  MATSUI], and the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. FAZIO], who have provided  the leadership and the driving force be hind this legislation. That is why this  is here  today,  and  the majority  is  happy to have been accommodating to  our friends  in the minority. That is  why this legislation is here today. It is  bipartisan in nature, with nine original  cosponsors,  five  Republicans,  four  Democrats.  With regard to the substance of the  legislation and some of the objections  which have been expressed, first, to say  that this should be limited to only a  part of the West does not solve the real  problem. Farmers  in Arkansas, Flor ida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,  and Texas are all affected. So we need  to address those regions of the country  as well. This legislation does that.  Further, to say, as the President has  indicated, that this should apply only  to agricultural conveyances, does not  solve the real problem. It only solves a  part of the problem. What do we say to  the city of Phoenix and other cities  who have concrete-lined culverts? Do  we tell them they have to treat that  water  like it was a pristine stream,  even though it is going to cost, in the  case of Phoenix, S66 million and pro vide absolutely no additional environthink that is not  mental benefit? No, I  wise.  So this legislation does go beyond ag ricultural  conveyances,  and  indeed  does address  the  real problems  that  many of the cities, particularly in the  West, face.  Finally,  let me emphasize  that  in  this legislation, it is very, very clear,  States may use more stringent envi ronmental requirements if they choose  to. So once again, some of the objec tions we  hear  really  stem  from  a  ""Washington  knows  best""  attitude.  The States may  impose much more  stringent requirements. We  trust the  States. We  have  confidence  in  the  States. So let us not fall back into the  old trap of saying ""Washington knows  best."" Let us give  flexibility  to  the  States. Let us pass this bipartisan leg islation overwhelmingly. I urge adop tion of the bill before us.  ",1996
80,House,104,-0.404,1163,1,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  rise in strong support of H.R. 2567, the Con structed Water Conveyances Reform Act of  1995. I want to thank Representative CONDIT  for his efforts to address this important issue.  California farmers have been very active in  developing  innovative strategies  for  reducing  the discharge of pollutants into our natural wa terways. Producers in the Sacramento Valley  have used closed drainage systems that hold  water until  its pesticides degrade, making  it  safe for release. Such efforts have yielded ex tremely impressive results. However, the pos sibility  that  these closed drainage systems  could be required to meet water quality stand ards similar to those for natural waterways has  created a great deal or uncertainty for users of  these pollution control methods.  H.R. 2567 would provide the certainty need ed to ensure  that these  innovative efforts to  improve water quality can continue to go for ward. At the same time, its provisions will en sure that there is no change in the regulation  of  the  impact of constructed water convey ances  on  natural waterways.  In  the Sac ramento area, we already face significant chal lenges in protecting and improving the quality  of our waterways. We must not make this task  more difficult.  I am aware that the administration has ex pressed concern about certain aspects of this  legislation.  I am pleased, however, that they  are committed to addressing the concerns of  California agriculture on this matter, and I am  ready to work with them to achieve resolution.  I urge my colleagues support for this issue  of great importance to California's agricultural  economy.  ",1996
81,House,104,-0.057,1163,1,Mr. HAYES.," Mr. Speaker, last May, I stood  in this very well and expressed my belief that  clean water is for people-people who believe  more  in  their State and community  than  in  Federal mandates  and  regulations.  I was  pleased to see that the House endorsed these  precepts as we overwhelmingly passed  this  Corrections Day legislation.  There are many rice farmers in south Louisi ana, and many more in the district of my good  friend  from California, Congressman CONDIT,  who irrigate their fields or transport agricultural  wastewater  to  treatment plants by  utilizing  man-made ditches. Although  the number of  these systems in Louisiana has dwindled over  the last decade, the cost of planting with such  canals is approximately half of the cost of the  current most  common  irrigation method- pumping private well water.  Among the reasons for the aforementioned  switch  f rem  low-cost  to  high-cost  irrigation  were undoubtedly costs added by  require ments of the Clean Water Act. The current law  compels States  to  establish water  quality  standards  for waters of  the United States.  Water quality  standards  identify designated  uses such as swimming, fishing, and drinking  and criteria necessary to achieve these uses.  lncorrecf .. past  interpretations have  required  farmers -to meet water quality standards  for  swimming, fishing, and drinking, uses beyond  the intentions for many man-made water con veyance systems.  H.R. 2567, the Constructed Water Convey ances Reform Act, is intended to afford States  necessary  flexibility  in setting water quality  standards,  if purposes of man-made water  conveyances are not compatible with des ignated uses and were never meant to support  recreation or aquatic  life.  I am also pleased  that this legislation, as the first to come under  the scrutiny of the Unfunded Mandate Reform  Act, should reduce costs to States and  local  jurisdictions.  These provisions are virtually  identical  to  language which passed the House by a wide spread bipartisan majority as part of H.R. 961,  the Clean Water Act amendments. H.R. 2567  is an extremely non-controversial and com monsense solution to yet another overbearing  regulatory problem for our Nation's farmers.  ",1996
82,,104,-0.211,1189,1,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay special tribute to Mr. Lincoln Gore on the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  occasion of his 80th birthday. His has been a  great example of the American life, one cen tered on  the premises of family, community,  and service to country. It is with great respect  that I wish him happy birthday.  ""Linc"" has been a resident of West Frank fort,  IL, since his birth on February 12, 1916.  The 7th of 12 children, Mr. Gore has  long  known  the pleasures of a  large  family. He  married Nellie Little and began his own family  in 1940 with the first of his three children. Mr.  Gore currently has nine grandchildren and  three great grandchildren, with the expectation  of two new additions in the near future. Linc's  love of  family was perhaps best evidenced  when he risked his life in an explosion at the  Orient No. 8 Mine. Mr. Gore  reentered  the  mine to help save his brother-in-law who was  still trapped inside.  As much as he has received from his family,  Mr. Gore has  returned even more  to West  Frankfort and  the United States of America.  Currently retired from the State of Illinois and  the city of West Frankfort, Linc, a  long-time  Democrat, has  served as a precinct com mitteeman for the last 20 years. He is also a  member of St.  John  the Baptist Catholic  Church and the West Frankfort Moose Lodge.  And when his country needed him, he an swered the call and served with the Army in  Europe during World War II.  Mr. Speaker, we all can  learn a great deal  from the example of Mr. Gore. His has been  a  life of  love, duty, and honor.  I wish him  many more years of happiness as he cele brates his birthday.  TRIBUTE TO ROSALIE MARIE  DEBEAUSSAERT  HON. DAVID E. BONIOR  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1996  ",1996
83,,104,-0.547,1189,1,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to  pay  tribute  to a good  friend, Rosalie Marie  DeBeaussaert. Rose, as she is known to her  friends, was honored  this past week by her  colleagues at a retirement dinner which they  hosted in honor of her many years of service.  Rose retired this past October from the Utica  community schools.  Rose is the kind of person who believes in  family and taking an active role in one's com munity. She has  lived her entire  life  fulfilling  these  responsibilities. She  is  the mother of  five, grandmother to six, and was the devoted  wit e to the late Henry DeBeaussaert. The in herent need to sacrifice  for the good of the  family was something Rose  learned early  in  life since she was 1 of 14 children. Hard work,  commitment,  and  taking  responsibility  for  one's self and others were values her parents  instilled which she successfully passed on to  her own children.  In  fact,  it  is because of  these values  that  I became acquainted with  Rose through her son Ken. Ken is a respected  Michigan State senator who has worked with  me since bet ore my first election to Congress.  After her children were grown, Rose began  taking care of other people's children when  she started working  for the Utica community  schools. She worked at almost every school in  1187  the district helping prepare meals for the many  hungry students. She retired as kitchen man ager from Utica High School where she had  worked  for many years. During her working  days she also helped care for her fell ow work ers by serving as a local steward in her union.  Through all  these years she has also  re mained committed to her faith. As a member  of the Altar Society at St.  Isidore Parish she  has held various offices over many years.  While I know she will be missed by her col leagues,  their loss is her family's gain.  I am  sure Rose is excited to be spending more time  with family and friends. Rose is a role model  to all who know her and she deserves all the  best  in.: retirement.  I ask that my colleagues  join me ; in offering heartfelt congratulations  and a sincere thank you for a job well done.  SALUTE TO REV. SAMUEL AMOS  BRACKEEN OF PlllLADELPlilA  HON. 1HOMAS M. FOGUETIA  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 23, 1996  Mr. FOGLIETT A. Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to  pay  special  tribute  to  Rev.  Samuel  Brackeen, founder and pastor of the Philippian  Baptist Church  to congratulate him on his  many years of service  to  the Philadelphia  community.  Reverend  Brackeen,  educated  at  Paul  Quinn College, Oberlin Graduate School of  Theology, University of Pittsburgh in Pennsyl vania, and Vanderbilt University, began his  tenure with the Philippian Baptist Church over  30 years ago. He  is founder of the Progres sive National Baptist Convention and the Bap tist  Global  Mission  Bureau.  Reverend  Brackeen has dedicated his  life to improving  the plight of his people in many areas.  Reverend Brackeen has also played a vital  role  in many programs  in  the Philadelphia  community as the vice president of the Pitts burgh N.A.A.C.P. branch, chairman of the civil  rights committee and chairman of the Centre  Avenue Y.M.C.A. Reverend  Brackeen  has  been  active  in  religious  and  community  projects, holding memberships in various orga nizations  for community betterment. He has  served as the Philadelphia community finance  chairman and board member of the Columbia  Y.M.C.A., executive director of  the Helping  Hand Committee  Inc. and board member of  Nannie Helen Burroughs School.  In Philadel phia, he has been active in  the fight against  police brutality, The 400 Ministers' Campaign,  the  fight  for  job  opportunities,  and  the  bettering of educational opportunities for Afri can-Americans. Currently, Reverend Brackeen  is an  incorporator and director of the United  Bank of Philadelphia, the only black commer cial bank in Pennsylvania.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in  congratulating the Reverend Samuel Brackeen  for  his many  years  of  service with  the  Philippian Baptist Church and the Philadelphia  community.  I wish  the Reverend  Samuel  Brackeen and  the Philippian Baptist Church  the very best as they continue their service to  the Baptist community in Philadelphia.  ",1996

86,,104,0.322,1215,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, last night,  President Clinton announced his inten tion  to  reenlist  in  the war against  drugs. It is an announcement that is  long overdue.  For 3 years, the Clinton administra tion has failed to provide any leader ship in this battle. And one of the re sults has been a dramatic increase in  drug use among America's youth.  One of the most eloquent and effec tive soldiers in the war against drugs is  former  First Lady Nancy  Reagan.  Throughout the 1980's Mrs. Reagan de voted her tremendous energy to lead ing  the ""Just Say No"" campaign-a  campaign  that  is credited with dra matically lowering this Nation's toler ance and use of illegal drugs.  Like countless other concerned citi zens, Mrs. Reagan  is concerned with  the recent increase in drug use. And a  column she wrote in yesterday's Wall  Street Journal should be required read ing for all Americans.  I salute Mrs. Reagan for her commit ment to this most important issue, and  I ask:'th.at her column be printed in the  RECORD.  The column follows:  JUST SAY ""WHOA""  (By Nancy Reagan)  Statistics released last fall from  the an nual Household Survey of Drug Use and,  more recently, from the 21st annual Monitor ing the Future Survey show that marijuana  use among teenagers was up again last year.  Where is the public outrage over this find ing? When w111  this country realize that as  long as we don't wake up and adopt a zero  tolerance for drug use, we are heading down  a path of no return? Must we lose another  generation of children  to  the horrors of  crack addiction? Must the statistics soar to  all-time highs before we bother to take no tice?  Last March I was invited to testify before  a congressional committee, at which time I  said: ""I am not here  to criticize or place  blame, but after the great strides that we  made just a few years back, I'm worried that  this nation is forgetting how endangered our  children are by drugs. I'm worried that for  the first time in many years, tolerance for  drugs and the mistaken perception that 'ev eryone is doing it' is creeping back into our  national mentality. And I am worried that  the psychological momentum we had against  drug use has been lost.  ""[Y]et it's more  than worry,"" I pleaded.  ""This weakening vigilance against the drug  threat can have a tragic effect on this coun try for many years to come .... How could  we have forgotten so quickly? Why is it we  no longer hear the drumbeat of condemna tion against drugs coming from our leaders  and our culture? Is it any wonder drug use  has started climbing again, and dramatically  so?""  Regarding the drug use survey, NBC News  reported: ""'Just Say No' was an effective  message  in  the '80s . . .  in  the  '90s much  more will be needed."" Denver drug counselor  Bob Cota  emphasized,  ""Kids have  to be  shown why they need to learn it early, in the  third and fourth grades-and it has to be re peated often.""  Repeated often-like in the '80s when the  national leadership was vigilant and visible.  And yes, we do need even more now. In re sponse  to  the 1994 Monitoring the Future  Survey, Joseph Califano Jr., chairman and  president of the Center on Addiction and  Substance Abuse at Columbia University  (CASA), warned: ""If historical trends con tinue,  the  jump  in marijuana use among  America's children (age 12-18) from 1992  to  1994 signals that 820,000 more of these chil dren w111  try cocaine  in their lifetime. Of  that number, about 58,000 will become regu lar cocaine users and addicts."" In a 1995 sur vey by CASA, adolescents said that drugs  were their ""number one"" problem. Our chil dren are crying out for help.  ",1996
87,House,104,0.426,1228,1,Mr. GEKAS.," Mr. Speaker,  just as  Pennsylvania was emerging from a se ries of natural disasters  that  lasted  over a period of 10 days, snow and then  more snow and  then  rain, and  then  flood,  the Governor of the Common wealth,  our  former  colleague, Tom  Ridge,  decried  the  slow  response of  FEMA,  the Federal Emergency Man agement Agency. He  did  so because  FEMA seemed to not be able to make  the connection between flood and rain  and snow and all the tragedies that oc curred all at one time.  0 1245  Then,  of course,  the Governor  re ceived a nasty rebuttal from the White  House, and nothing was  then accom plished in trying to address the prob lems of the disaster. Since that time  the Governor convened a meeting in  Harrisburg of the FEMA officials, Sec retary Pena and others. We were able  to resolve  the methodology by which  the Federal Emergency Management  Agency will respond in the future. In  the meantime, I aim  to bring to the  committee process an examination of  the FEMA procedures.

The next day the House leader ship says  it might  force  the United  States into default. The majority lead er says yes; the budget chairman says  no.  Mr. Speaker, nothing good can come  from holding America's credit rating  hostage to ideological extremism. The  cost of credit to American business is  at risk by reckless statements about  forcing the United States into default.  Threatening to force the United States  into default is reckless and irrespon sible._Jt makes it impossible for busi nesses-throughout the country to plan  for their needs in the credit market.  We hear a  lot of  talk  these days  about our children's future on the floor  of this House. Mr. Speaker, threatening  to force the United States into default  risks our children's future because it  jeopardizes  the  gold-plated  credit worthiness  of  the United States of  America.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong-in fact,  strong support would be  too weak a  term-I rise  in fervent support of S.  1124,  t{he Department of Defense au thori~tion conference report.  I want  to commend  the chairman,  the gen tleman  from  South  Carolina  [Mr.  SPENCE], and all members of the com mittee who have labored long and hard  to achieve what I think is truly a bi partisan work product.  During  the many weeks of debate  over this legislation, one very impor tant issue which was always bipartisan  from the very beginning has been the  provisions to significantly reform the  procurement system of the Department  of Defense and the civilian agencies in  order to make the Federal Government  a smart shopper, something it has not  been accused of being  in my  tenure  here or for a long time before that.  The provisions that are in this bill  are consistent with H.R. 1670, the Fed eral Acquisition Reform Act of 1995,  which was a  joint  initiative of  the  Committee on Government Reform and  Oversight and the Committee on Na tional Security. Those measures passed  the House by a vote of 423 to 0 in Sep tember of last year.  The private sector continues to  in crease  its productivity and  its effec tiveness  in  this whole area because  they are not bound down by the arcane,  convoluted Rube Goldberg type of pro visions  that the Federal Government  has to operate with in its procurement  system. It is a centrally planned sys tem as it exists, expensive to operate,  and heavily laden with paperwork re quirements  and  bureaucracy.  Piece meal reforms just have not done  the  job. Today's system forces taxpayers and this is the significant point, Mr.  Speaker-forces taxpayers to pay a 20percent premium on Federal purchases;  on all Federal purchases, from fighter  aircraft to office supplies, we are pay ing a premium of 20 percent, which this  bill is going to go a  long way toward  correcting.  This  agreement  provides  reforms  needed to make DOD and the civilian  agencies smart shoppers, as I said. The  conference agreement promotes afford able and commonsense approaches  to  meet our budgetary goals by, among  other  things,  providing  for  the  in creased use of commercial  items,  in creasing  the competitiveness of U.S.  defense products in international mar kets,  eliminating  numerous  govern ment-unique procedures, and creating a  ",1996
91,House,104,0.439,1254,1,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday in this House we voted to give  and grant to two people, well deserv ing, the Congressional gold medal, and  that was  to Dr.  Billy  and Ruth  Graham, and that motion passed over whelmingly in this House. It is going  to  the Senate and hopefully will be  passed by a similar margin there and  signed by the President of the United  States.  I just wanted to recognize these two  extraordinary Americans  and what  they have done, for their extraordinary  service  they have committed to  this  country and the people of this planet.  Dr. Graham has evangelized  to more  people on  this globe, on  this effort,  than any human in history that he has  witnessed to during the time period of  his service, and it continues.  Many writers, both political and reli gious, in this country are saying we as  a Na~ion are entering a period of a  fourth,'' awakening,  a  time period of  moral and spiritual renewal in Amer ica, where we  look at ourselves and  say, Are we doing  the rights  things?  Are we doing the things that will last,  not just for this lifetime, but for a fur ther period of time on into eternity?  They are saying we are entering into  a period of moral and spiritual renewal,  a reassessment of our values as a coun try. That is going to do a great deal to  solve our true problems in America.  Mr. Speaker, as I travel my district  in eastern Kansas and talk to people  back home, I ask them, do they think  the biggest problems we face as a Na tion, are they moral or are they eco nomic? Are they the problems associ ated with the economy or problems as sociated with values? And I will get in  almost every crowd 8 or 9 to 1 that will  say the problems are moral rather than  they are economic we are facing. They  are problems with family and a disinte gration of the family. They are prob lems with drugs. They are problems  with crime. They are problems with  people not willing to work. They are  problems with people willing  to  do  things that if they would think about  it or if their own moral compass was a  little better set, they would not do at  all.  The  pro bl ems we  are  facing  are  moral, and the decline is taking place  there. Yet I am optimistic in looking  to the future, because I think we are fi nally  starting  to  address  the  fun damental problems we have as a soci ety, the value problems we have, and  one does not address them in Congress.  One addresses them in the individual  community,  in the individual family,  in the individual person and what he  does.  That is how we change the culture,  the society of this America. That is  how we make ourselves better. That is  how we solve our problems of family.  That is how we solve our problems of  crime. That is how we solve our prob lems  dealing with  drugs,  problems  dealing with welfare. We change our selves and our own values and moral  and spiritual outlook.  Mr. Speaker, I think we need to get  back to the basics and get back to the  basic values, values of family, values of  work,  and  recognition  of  a  higher  moral authority.

So, where or why she has con cluded that it is a decrease is simply  not the facts.  It is so frustrating to come to this  body and listen to talk or rhetoric or  whatever you want to call it, and hear  people just say whatever they want to  say and it has nothing to do with the  truth. I guess that is why I ran for of fice.  Last  night,  the President  talked  about education. He revered education.  Education is a wonderful thing, and as  I said, we have increased funding for  education. But he left out, I guess, kin dergarten to elementary because in el ementary  schools  now,  they  have  barbed wire along the fences right now.

94,,104,-0.408,1293,1,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Federal Marshal Romoto J.  lmundi. At  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the age of 75, Marshal lmundi has completed  53 consecutive years of Government service  and retired from his post as U.S. marshal for  the southern district in New York on October  15, 1995.  Mr. lmundi was a highly respected marshal  in New York and  has  received  numerous  awards and plaques during his tong and distin guished career  in  law enforcement. For 13  years, Mr.  lmundi's office has been  respon sible for the security of 80 Federal judges, 200  U.S. attorneys, 80 security officers, 100 mar shals and  inspectors, and dozens of crime  suspects.  In recognition of his unfailing dedi cation to his work, I am inserting an article into  the RECORD detailing his years of public serv ice.  The suspects he has escorted have been  some of the most famous and notorious this  century, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman-found  guilty  of plotting  the  bombing  of  national  monuments such as  the Statue of Liberty and those accused of plotting the World Trade  Center bombing. Not a single one of his cli ents has been injured or harmed in any way  during his protection, to say nothing of all the  innocent  lives he has helped  to save during  the course of his impeccable career.  The southern district of New York is losing  a marshal greatly respected by all people. He  brought to his post, his 32 years of experience  in the New York Police Force and 8 years as  an investigator for the U.S. Veterans Adminis tration. He was  first appointed Federal mar shal by President Ronald Reagan and served  under Presidents George Bush and Bill Clin ton, giving him  the distinction of being  the  longest-serving Federal marshal  this century.  His record in public office has been an inspira tion to his colleagues as well as the commu nity as a whole.  Mr.  lmundi's well-deserved  retirement will  sadden all those who gained so much from his  time in office: not just the citizens of New York  but all  the people of  the United States. On  January 30, 1996, there will be an event hon oring Mr.  lmundi's years of service and dedi cation  to  law enforcement and  justice. Mr.  Speaker,  I know you will join me  in wishing  Mr. lmundi well and the best of luck in his re tirement.  GLADIATOR RETIRES AFTER HALF-CENTURY OF  SERVICE  Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson may have  been the most famous federal marshals.  Romolo J. Imundi may be the most photo graphed.  ""I'm also the longest-serving federal mar shal in this century,"" Imundi said.  He retired Oct. 15 from his job as U.S. mar shal for the Southern District in New York  after 13 years in the post. He was appointed  by President Reagan in 1982.  At 75,  Imundi completed 53 years of gov ernment service, including 32 years as a New  York City police officer and detective, eight  years as an investigator for the U.S. veter ans Administration and the past 13 as a fed eral marshal in the Manhattan office.  Imundi and his wife of 48 years, Rosemarie,  who have  four grown children and eight  grandchildren, have  lived in the Crestwood  section of Yonkers the past eight years.  ""This job is a presidential appointment,""  Imundi said. ""George Washington appointed  the first federal marshal in New York City in  1789. He was the chief lawman for the area.  I'm a  conservative Republican.  I was ap1291  pointed  by Reagan  and  reappointed  by  George Bush. When Bill Clinton came in, I  was asked to stay on the job.""  Imundi,  nicknamed  the  ""Roman  glad iator,"" often was seen in newspaper photo graphs and on television as he escorted such  suspects as Leona Helmsley, Bess Myerson,  mobster  ""Fat  Tony""  Salerno, Michael  Milken, Mafia  boss Paul Castellano  and  Imelda Marcos into federal court.  His  last case was completed earlier this  month when Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman was  convicted of plotting the bombing of the Lin coln Tunnel, the United Nations, the Holland  Tunnel and the Statue of Liberty.  ""Imagine what would have happened  if  they blew up a  tunnel, and you had water  cascadlng all over Manhattan,"" he said. ""It  is too horrible to even think about.""  The sheik and his followers were moved  each day from the Metropolitan Corrections  Center underground to the federal courts for  their trial. All were found guilty and w111 be  sentenced in January.  ""I think they w111 all spend  the rest of  their natural lives in jail,"" Imundi said.  They were not subject to the death pen alty. Imundi has witnessed one execution,  the electrocution of murderer Elmer ""Trig ger"" Burke in Sing Sing Correctional Facil ity 40 years ago.  For 13 years, Imundi's office has been re sponsible  for  the  security  of  80  federal  judges, 200 U.S. attorney, 80 security officers,  100 marshals and  inspectors and dozens of  crime suspects.  He never had a client injured or killed in  all  that  time,  although  junk-bond  king  Milken fainted after Judge Kimba Wood sen tenced him to 10 years in prison.  Former Miss America Myerson,  charged  with a  tax violation, was close to fainting  when she was in a cell and was told she had  to be fingerprinted.  ""I put a hand on her shoulder and steadied  her,"" he said.  Helmsley, who served three years in prison  on a tax charge, was one of his most difficult  cases.  ""She was  so disliked  that many people  stood on the courthouse steps and screamed  obscenities at her every day of the trial,"" he  said.  ""The terrorist trial was clearly the trial of  the century, not that thing in Los Angeles,""  he said. ""M1llions of lives were at stake here  when  these  guys  plotted  their  violence.  Judge Michael B. Mukasey really did a great  job of handling that. He had to deal daily  with 15 lawyers and kept* * *.""  Imundi, who handled the suspects in the  World Trade Center bombing case, said that  crime really frightened him.  ""Few people know this, but if that bomb  was planted two stories higher and not in the  garage, that entire building would have gone  down,"" he said. ""It would have dwarfed the  bombing at Oklahoma City and  thousands  upon  thousands of  lives would have been  lost.""  Now, the care and feeding of so many sus pects has been turned over to a new mar shal-Martin Burke, a bodyguard for former  Gov. Mario Cuomo.  ""Now, I'll just take it easy for a while, do  some painting, work around the house, tend  to my garden, and enjoy our family,"" Imundi  said.  Few public servants have done as much to  earn a quiet, peaceful retirement as Imundi  has. Few have had a half-century of such ad ventures.  ",1996

97,,104,0.429,1332,1,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I  intro duce the Environmental Infrastructure  Financing Act of 1996. The bill will  amend  the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to allow recycling facilities to be  eligible for tax-exempt bond financing.  A continuing problem in the develop ment of recycling efforts is the need  for markets for the materials that are  being collected. Processes exist for re manufacturing the recycled materials  into new products, but they frequently  require extensive capital investment.  An approach that is often attempted  is the use of the Federal tax-exempt  bond program, which does have a sub category for solid waste projects. Solid  waste recycling facilities should con stitute  a  legitimate  application  of  these funds; however, certain sections  of the  tax code define solid waste as  being ""material without value."" With  recycled materials now being traded as  commodities  they do,  in  fact,  have  value, making  the  facilities which  might process them ineligible for tax exempt  financing.  This  definitional  problem  impedes  the construction of  recycling facilities and hurts the devel opment of  recycling materials mar kets.  My bill will correct this pro bl em in  the tax code and allow recycling facili ties  to obtain  tax-exempt  financing.  The Environmental Infrastructure Fi nancing Act of 1996 will foster the fur ther development of the recycling in dustry and promote increased recycling  on the State and local level.

98,,104,-0.313,1332,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to speak about the role of money in  politics, and  its consequences.  I  rise  also  to introducing a  legislative pro posal-a  constitutional  amendment  and a bill-to free democracy from the  power of money.  Mr. President,  last fall a man ap proached me in New Jersey. He said,  ""Senator, I worked at this place, in one  job, for 22 years, In that 22 years, three  different companies owned  the place.  In not one of the three companies did I  vest  for a  pension, because none of  them owned the place long enough. So  I am now retiring, after 22 years of  working here, without a pension, at  all.""  A woman came up to me on my an nual walk along the Jersey Shore and  said, ""six months ago, my husband lost  his job. Two months ago, I lost my job.  We have  three children and now we  have no health insurance. I went to our  pediatrician and he said if the kids get  sick, he'll take care of them but Sen ator,  this  is  America,  and  you  shouldn't have to have a friendly pedia trician in order to get health care for  your kids.""  In California, a white-collar worker  named Ron Smith who lost his job at  McDonnell-Douglas 2 years ago told a  journalist how his sense that he was  ""starting to lose my grip"" feeds  into  the divisiveness  that  is  tearing our  country apart: ""I get angry, and a lot  of anger is coming out,"" he said. ""I'm  blaming everyone, minorities,  aliens  co~ across the border. I don't know  how much truth there is to it. I mean,  I don't  think there are any planners  and engineers coming across the bor der. [But] it hurts when you go to an  interview and you know damn well you  can do the job, and you know they are  looking at you and thinking, 'Forget  it.""'.  In the last 7 years, 100,000 people lost  their jobs with GE, 60,000 at IBM, 40,000  at Sears. The merger of Chase Manhat tan with Chemical Bank will mean the  loss of 12,000 jobs. And AT&T just an nounced that they will eliminate 40,000  more jobs, most of them this year.  My colleague Senator BIDEN recently  told me that at the Hercules Corp.'s re search center outside Wilmington, the  downsizing has accelerated and become  brutal. When employees arrive at their  office building on Monday morning,  they know that they have been fired  when  they  see a Pinkerton security  man standing outside their office door.  Usually he tells them that he's sorry  and he knows they've worked hard for  22 years, but could  they please have  their desk cleaned out by noon-and if  they don't mind, he'll stand at  the  door,  because  the  company  doesn't  want to take the chance that the com puter system will be  sabotaged. On  Mondays at  the Hercules Center, no  one carpools, because it is impossible  to predict who will be going home at  noon.  The heavy footsteps of downsizing,  relocation, part-time  jobs,  temp jobs,  middle age without health care and re tirement without a  pension may be  near or still distant, but they are heard  in every home. People are working  harder for less. In 1973 the average pro duction, nonsupervisory wage was $315.  In 1994 it was $256. That's about 70 per cent of workers. During  the  first 6  months of 1993, the Clinton administra tion announced  that 1.3 million  jobs  had been created, to which a TWA ma chinist replied, ""Yeah, my wife and I  have four of them."" And indeed, over  half of the newly created jobs were part  time.  For all but the fabulously wealthy,  the idea that working hard can lead to  a secure future, a chance to provide a  better life  for your children, and an  adequate retirement is slipping away. I  hear this fear everywhere: Among the  urban working poor, in suburban living  ",1996
99,House,104,0.338,1345,1,Mr. HOKE.," Mr. Speaker, for the past  8 months liberal interest groups have  been advertising in my district, and we  have heard a drum beat of the same  message here in the Congress from the  minority, where millions  of dollars  have been spent trying to scare seniors  about Medicare and mislead the public  about what Congress is trying to do to  secure America's future.  Most people recognize  that the ads  and the rhetoric are completely politi cally motivated and dismiss them, but  the problem with the big lie is that if  it is repeated often enough some people  will believe  it. And  the real  tragedy  will be if it works, because, let us face  it, it really does not matter if I am  back or any particular  individual  is  back, but what matters very,  very  deeply is if our Nation misses this ex traordinary opportunity to stop steal ing from our children's future to save  Medicare  from bankruptcy, most im portantly,  to  renew  the American  dream and to get our country back on  the right track. That would be an in calculable tragedy.  So, Mr. Speaker, I just hope that you  are listenfog and the American people  are  listening,  and  that  this  dema goguery and scare-mongering is not ef fective.

Mr. Speaker, it's looking an awful lot  like my Republican colleagues are hav ing trouble running the Congress.  Today we are one-third of the way  into  the fiscal year and  the Govern ment is barely running-when it is it's  doing  so by  the  skin of  its  teeth,  thanks only  to  a  series  of hastily  passed continuing resolutions.  For  those who may have forgotten  why  the Government keeps shutting  down  for  those who may not realize  why all  these continuing resolutions  are necessary in the first place.  It's because the Republican Congress  has failed to fulfill its most basic re sponsibility.  The responsibility to pass 13 appro priations bills by October 1.  Those appropriations bills are prob ably the most important job Congress  has  and  despite  an  unprecedented  amount of wasted time and paper last  year this Republican Congress has ac complished  less  than  any Congress  since World War II.

We  are  going to raise the cost, if the interest  rates in this country go up just 1 per cent, the average cost of a home mort gage will go up Sl,200. The cost of bor rowing by the Federal Government will  go up by $150 billion; more than our en tire education budget in the course of  the next 7 years.  Speaker, my Republican  col leagues are talking about fiddling with  the fundamental economic system that  this world has developed  to pay  its  bills. What we can have here is the ex tremism of the Republicans. Not that  they want  just  a  balanced  budget,  which I want; not just a balanced budg et scored by CBO, which I want; but,  they want their particular version of  the balanced budget or else they say  they are going to send the entire debt  of the United States of America into  default.  Mr. Speaker, it is blackmaiL It is the  kind of Russian roulette politics that  brings a nation down, and does not  make it greater. We have a Constitu tion in this country that divides power  between  the President and  the Con gress, the House and the Senate. Let  that policy of compromise move for ward. Do not let one particular group  of freshmen Republicans put their ex tremist views on  the people of this  country.

The Republicans  don't believe Treasury  Secretary Rubin when he warned of default.  Instead,  they have  resorted  to a dangerous  game of chicken with our Nation's economy.  If we do default on the national debt, it will  have an adverse effect on so many people.  Social Security and veteran benefit recipients  may not receive checks. Interest rates would  rise dramatically, affecting home, car, and stu dent  loans. Bond prices would  fall dramati cally, causing people to sell in fear of this.  First, the Republicans held Government em ployees hostage  in  their attempt  to get the  President to cave in to their extreme balanced  budget plan. And now, they are fooling around  with the possibility of defaulting on the debt.  They just never learn that their extreme bul lying tactics just aren't going to work.  We can't afford  to default on  the national  debt. We need a clean debt limit extension.  VOTING  BALLOTS  PRINTED  IN  FOREIGN LANGUAGES, ANOTHER  EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT EX CESS  The Speaker pro  tempore. Under a  previous order of the House,  the gen tleman from Wisconsin  [Mr. ROTH]  is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1996
103,House,104,0.351,1371,1,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to call attention to another example of  Government excess. In the spirit of so called multiculturalism,  the Federal  Government has mandated since 1965  that voting ballots and materials be  printed  in dozens of languages other  than English. Today there are some 375  voting districts  across  this  country  that are required  to print ballots in  foreign languages.  In a classic example of an unfunded  mandate  gone  amok,  politicians  in  Washington are forcing States and lo calities to provide multilingual ballots  without providing the funds to imple ment  the ballots. This Don Quixote  mandate,  the  legislation  that  has  caused  this mandate  is  the  voting  Rights Act of 1965. Under  the  law,  counties must  provide multilingual  voting information and ballots in the  language of any minority groups with  more than 10,000 eligible voters in that  county.  In  the  real world,  these  services  should not be needed at all. Voting  rights are extended to citizens of this  country, and one needs to demonstrate  some fluency in English to become a  U.S. citizen, so why all of these ballots.  In o~r languages other than English?  In practice, this requirement for citi zenship has been unenforced, but that  does not change  the  facts. By  law,  English is the requirement for citizen ship in this country. We should not be  providing Government services, in di rect contradiction with  the spirit,  if  not  the  letter, of  the  law's require ment.  Morevoer,  these services are expen sive, as well as unnecessary. It might  surprise supporters of multilingual bal lots to know that very few people actu ally request such special treatment. By  and large multilingual ballots are rare ly requested, and even less often used,  even when they are provided. That is  what makes these costs and their cost  to  the  local  taxpayers all  the more  shocking.  Election officials in Alameda County,  CA,  told me recently that they spent  almost $100,000  to produce ballots in  Spanish and Chinese  for  the  entire  country, yet only 900 were ultimately  requested. You can do  the math. The  taxpayers of Alameda County  spent  over $100 for every multilingual ballot  that was actually used in  that June  1994  election. This  appears  to be  a  trend.  The last election in Los Angeles saw  ballots printed in six languages other  than English. Among them were Span ish,  Chinese,  Japanese, Vietnamese,  Tagalog, and Korean. It cost the city  government over $125,000 to prepare the  materials. Yet, and listen to this, only  927  ballots were  used.  Los Angeles  spent over $135 for each voter the city  helped.  Even small communities are not im mune. Long Beach spent a  relatively  modest $1,026  preparing multilingual  materials for its eligible voters when  only 22 requests came in. The township  spent over $280 per multilingual voter.  As a  frustrated election official  told  me recently, ""This is a lot of money to  help a few people."" That official could  not be more right.  These ballots have other, more seri ous costs associated with  them,  too.  Providing these special services creates  the  fiction  that newcomers  to  this  country can enjoy the full benefits of  citizenship without the language of the  land, which is English.

I urge my colleagues to vote for this  resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my chair man  for yielding me time to address the for eign operations portion of the bill before us.  As my colleagues know, the fiscal year 1996  foreign operations appropriations cont erence  report was approved by  the House of Rep resentatives nearly 3 months ago by a biparti san vote of 351  to 71. Working together with  all of my colleagues on the Subcommittee on  Foreign Operations, and  I might add, with a  great deal of help  from  the gentleman  from  Wisconsin, we were able to fashion a biparti san bill. It is significantly below the administra tion's  request  levels, yet  I believe we were  very  fair in determining how those cuts were  apportioned. It wasn't easy but we did it.  I would  like to emphasize three things  for  my colleagues. First, The conference  report  cited  in  this bill  is  the  identical  language  passed by  the House  last October. There  have been no changes  in  the agreed upon  conference  report  language. Second,  let me  just remind my colleagues of some key facts.  At $12.1 billion, it is nearly 19 percent below  the President's requested level and 11 percent  below the fiscal year 1995 levels. At the same  time,  the bill provides $500 million  for child  survival  and  disease  prevention  programs,  with child survival activities funded at $25 mil lion over the fiscal year 1995 level. We also  provide the traditional amounts for Israel and  Egypt. Prime Minister Rabin's tragic death re inforces the need for a peaceful settlement in  the Middle East.  In  this  respect,  the sub committee's bipartisan support for Middle East  Peace Process is reflected in the conference  report agreement.  But we did have one issue which was not  so easy  to  resolve.  It was  the question of  abortion  funding and the Mexico City policy.  This  issue  is of critical  importance  to me,  therefore  I was very disappointed  that  the  Senate did not accept the House-passed lan guage on this issue the very first time we sent  it to them. But that is the nature of the Con gress.  After months of hard work an agreement  has been reached on a formula which strongly  supports the House position and the authoriz ing committee's  responsibility  for  this  issue.  The language in the bill before you is a critical  ",1996
107,,104,0.471,1423,1,Mr. TATE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to intro duce a simple piece of legislation designed to  fix a major flaw in U.S. immigration law. Over  the past decade,  the subject of  immigration  has captured the interest of the American peo ple. This year, it has moved to the forefront of  the political arena  in Washington, DC. Major  bills have been introduced in both the House  and Senate to control  illegal immigration and  reform legal immigration. The bill I bring to the  floor today is not a sweeping solution to our  immigration woes, but a strong step  in  the  right direction.  From the time of our forefathers, U.S. immi gration policy has provided the opportunity for  millions of people to come to America to help  us build  the strongest, most prosperous de mocracy  in the world.  In more recent years,  however, many have begun to take advantage  of our open door policy. Today, some believe  that immigration to the United States is a right  instead of a privilege.  The  Immigration and Naturalization Service  estimates  that  300,000  people  enter  the  United States illegally every year, and 3.8 mil lion  currently  live  in  this  country  illegally.  These people are taking advantage of Amer ican generosity and openness without regard  for our  laws or our principles. Mr. Speaker,  that is not what America is all about.  Illegal immigrants come to the United States  at the expense of those who choose to play  by  the  rules and come  to America  legally.  Most Americans probably don't even know it,  but our laws do not penalize individuals who  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  intentionally cross our borders illegally. Under  current  law, any  individual who enters  the  United States illegally and is deported  is still  eligible for legal immigration later. Despite the  fact that they have already broken one of our  laws, illegal immigrants are provided the same  privileges under U.S. immigration law as any one else.  I am introducing legislation today to put an  end to this madness. Under my bill, if an indi vidual breaks our immigration  laws by  inten tionally entering the United States illegally, he  or she will never again be eligible for any kind  of temporary or  immigrant visa. Not 1 year  later, not 20 years  later, never. We need to  use our precious immigration resources wisely  instead of wasting them on people who have  no respect for American laws.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge my colleagues to sup port this legislation and to stand up for hon esty and integrity. Thank you.

Phil has devoted 53 years to public service  within  the United States and Ocean County  governments. An  example  to us all, Phil's  dedication and creativity have  improved  the  lives of many Americans.  Of  course,  all  commentary  aside,  Phil  Rubenstein's  record speaks  for  itself. From  1943  to 1954 Phil served as  the Assistant  Chief of the Service Division of the Veterans  Administration. He continued his service until  197 4 by working as a Social Security Rep resentative in the Northeast. Phil retired from  the Federal Civil Service but continued to hon orably serve  the citizens of Ocean County,  New Jersey by assuming  the directorship of  the Ocean County Office on Aging.  1421  As the director of the Ocean County Office  on Aging, Phil has left an indelible impression  on our local community an on the lives of sen ior citizens across the nation.  A few of his more notable accomplishments  include: Creating  free mammography  and  prostate cancer screening programs; creating  a complete senior citizen complex that among  other things established nutrition sites, senior  centers, home delivered meal programs, and  other outreach programs;  the creation of the  Ocean  County  Handicapped  and  Elderly  Transportation Service.  As I deliver these words of praise, I realize  that  I am only one voice of many that have  done J~ewise. Phil has received, among oth ers, awards from the Governor for ""Outstand ing Achievement  for  Innovative Programs  for  the Elderly,"" from the New Jersey Association  of Freeholders for ""Outstanding Service,"" from  the  Ocean  County  Board  of  Chosen  Freeholders for ""Distinguished,"" and three dis tinguished Federal Service Awards.  The people who probably  thank Phil  the  most, however, are all of those who benefit  from the results of his hard work. Most notable  are the senior citizens who need access  to  transportation to receive medical care. Every  day over 650 people across  the Nation are  able to utilize this service.  I could  continue with  a  litany  of other  awards and accomplishments  that Phil has  earned. Instead,  I will end here and say this.  Phil, on  this day-the day before your 80th  birthday-I give  you my  best wishes and  hopes  for another rewarding and successful  year. Happy birthday.  GEORGIANS SUPPORT SOLDIERS  IN BOSNIA  HON.

Mr.  Mr. Speaker, I have the opportunity  to introduce to the House their newest  colleague. He is the son of Rev. Ruth  Cummings and Rev. Robert Cummings.  Mr. Speaker, before I make my brief  remarks  and yield  to  the minority  leader,  I would  like  to acknowledge  Senators SARBANES and MIKULSKI, who  have joined us from the other body.  Speaker,  although  under  the  rules I cannot recognize them as being  in the gallery, and I shall not do so, it  has been brought to my attention that  the distinguished Speaker of the Mary land House of Delegates, Casper Tay lor, will be able to hear my words.

111,House,104,-0.378,17,7,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I say to the  gentleman from Colorado, we are going  to pass the rule, we are going to pass  the bill. It reduces spending, but in a  way that does not hurt children and  their education, does not hurt the envi ronment, does not hurt citizens who  want security in their neighborhoods,  because it does not adopt the cuts that  you voted for.  0 1215  We want to expand this and have a  vote on the minimum wage. We will  make an agreement. If the Speaker  says we will have a vote, we will not  oppose the previous question. But if he  says we will not have one, do not say  go through committee.  I want to read something from No vember 8, 1989. This is a statement by  Mr. DOLE on the floor: ""We had a White  House meeting this morning, and the  President asked about minimum wage  and the progress it was making. I said  we hoped to have it passed as early as  noon or 1:00."" That was Mr. DOLE  in  1989. In 1996, Mr. DOLE has an option:  either continue to cater to the radical  right of the Republican Party or do  what was done in 1989.  The minimum wage  today  is back  where it was in 1989. We need to move  ahead. You are standing there trying  to divert attention. We are going  to  vote for the rule and the bill, but we  should  also bring up  the minimum  wage. It is of importance to the work ing families of this country.  ",1996
112,House,104,-0.517,17,7,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for  yielding me  the  time.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right.  The minimum wage should have been  raised 2 years ago, and I had a bill in to  raise it to $5.50 an hour. But the fact  that it was not raised then makes it  more imperative that we raise it now  because the purchasing power of low wage workers has declined even more.  So let us move forward today and pass  a minimum wage.  ",1996

115,House,104,-0.473,238,7,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the state ments from the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. LIVINGSTON],  the chairman  of the Committee on Appropriations,  about the plight of the State of Louisi ana. Louisiana is trying to handle its  own State budget, but so is every other  State in this country. What Louisiana  is getting is a very sweet deal. It is a  special  treatment.  It  is pork barrel  money. They are getting Federal dol lars without doing what they are re quired under Federal law to put up for  their own citizens who receive Medic aid benefits.  The reason they are in this fix has  nothing to do with the Federal Govern ment. It has to do with the abuse by  the State of Louisiana  in  the 1980's  when  they  leveraged Federal dollars  into  the Medicaid Program and  then  did not even use  it for health care.  They used it for roads and they used it  for prisons. They used it to balance  their budget and they became addicted  to that money. Now, because they have  one of their own in a very powerful po sition, they are being singled out; they  and New Hampshire, to get Federal dol lars to help them meet their fiscal re quirements.  The State of California has a prob lem. Every State has a  problem  to  make their budgets match income and  outgo. Medicaid is a big cost. But the  Federal Government  should  not  be  standing in  the place of those State  governments to take on their respon sibilities.  Put this in the context of what Re publicans wanted  earlier  this  year.  What they wanted was a block grant  with cuts in Federal and State dollars  under the Medicaid Program, and the  public that is to be served by those pro grams be damned. They could go with out care under the provisions of what  is substituted for the existing Medicaid  Program under  the Republican  pro posal. This is an outrage. It is unfair. It  should not have happened.  ",1996
116,House,104,0.492,238,7,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Louisi ana [Mr. TAUZIN].  ",1996
117,House,104,0.03,238,7,Mr. TAUZIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  correct  the  record. First of all, Mr.  Speaker, Louisiana has a  law on its  books, has had a law on its books since  well into the 1970's, that Medicaid re ceipts and Medicare moneys cannot be  spent on anything but health care in  that State. It was not spent on roads  and bridges, as the gentleman in the  well previously alluded to. I am sure  that gentleman in the well previously  alluded to. I am sure that gentleman  voted against the earthquake relief to  California when that State needed help  from this Federal Government.  However,  the provisions in this bill  do not add a dime to the Federal defi cit, do not increase spending in Louisi ana one dime. It simply allows Louisi ana to do something it has to do, and  that is to correct the formula by which  the State applied for and received its  Federal funding all these years.  ",1996
118,House,104,-0.516,290,7,Mr. SABO.," Mr. Speaker, the Congres sional Budget Act sets up procedures to  allow  the  appropriations  process  to  move forward in situations when the  budget resolution is behind schedule. I  would  like  to  inquire of  the Chair  whether  these procedures have been  followed.  In particular, if the conference report  on the budget resolution is not adopted  by April 15, section 603 of the Budget  Act directs the chairman of the Com mittee on the Budget to submit to the  House  a  spending  allocation  to  the  Committee on Appropriations for  the  coming fiscal year. The allocation is to  be based on the discretionary spending  limits set by  law.  Its purpose  is  to  allow the House to begin work on ap propriation bills.  Section 603 of  the Budget Act  re quires  this allocation  to be  filed as  soon as practicable after April 15. When  I was chairman of the Committee on  the Budget, I submitted this allocation  when it was required, and my prede cessor, Leon Panetta, did as well.  If we are to avoid running the Gov ernment  on  continuing  resolutions  again this year, it is essential that the  appropriations process get started. The  April 15 deadline set by the Budget Act  for completion of the budget resolution  passed more than a week ago, and the  House markup has not even been sched uled.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to inquire whether a  fiscal year 1997  spending allocation to the Committee  on Appropriations has been submitted  to the House as required by section 603  of the Congressional Budget Act.  0 1700  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LAHOOD). The Chair would advise the  gentleman from Minnesota to consult  with the chairman of the Committee  on the Budget on this matter of a sub mission as soon as practicable after  April 15.  ",1996

122,Senate,104,-0.328,316,7,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, last Fri day,  the majority  leader,  Senator  DOLE,  took to  the  floor and made a  rather critical speech of our present  policy in Haiti. He introduced at that  time a report which was prepared by a  Republican staff delegation  that had  gone down to Haiti during the Easter  recess.  I  think  the  report probably  could have been written a week or two  in advance of the  trip and  the  trip  might not have even been necessary  since there was not any real effort to  examine the issues in Haiti and what  has happened  there over  the past 18  months or so.  This morning I wish to take a  few  minutes  to apprise my colleagues of  how  I  see  the present  situation  in  Hai ti. Where we have come over the  past number of months in making real  progress  there. The good news  is, of  course, that Haiti is not in the head lines on a daily basis but there has  been significant progress.  I think it is important that my col leagues and others who have heard  Senator DOLE'S remarks have an oppor tunity to hear another point of view,  and that is what I would like to do this  morning.  I am no stranger to Hai ti. I have vis ited the country many times over the  years. When I was a Peace Corps volun teer 30 years ago, I lived very close to  the Haitian border in the Dominican  Republic. I visited Haiti often in those  days and still have many close friends  in the country of Haiti.  Most  recently,  I visited Haiti  this  past January to make my own first hand assessment of the political situa tion. Based upon  that visit, and  the  many others that I have made over the  years, one thing is crystal clear. Presi dent Clinton's decision  in September  1994 to support democracy in Haiti was  the right thing  to do. Whatever else  one might say about United States pol icy, Hai ti  is a  far,  far better place  today than it was 19 months ago.  Remember what  those  days were  like. The reign of terror was the order  of the day. Murder, rape, and kidnaping  were daily occurrences in Hai ti, all in  an effort to intimidate the Haitian peo ple. Those days are gone now. And, de spite the fact that Haiti is a long way,  a  long way  from becoming a  Jeffer sonian democracy, we are not going to  rewrite almost 200 years of Haitian his tory in less than 2 years-I believe that  today the Haitian people are one step  closer to fulfilling their aspirations of  living in freedom and dignity without  fear of their Government.  An important phase of our Haiti pol icy came to a close just a month or so  ago. U.S. forces are no longer partici pants in the United Nations mandated  mission.  In fact,  last week  the final  contingent of United States forces left  Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  When President Clinton dispatched  United States forces to Haiti in the fall  of 1994, he set a deadline of February  29, 1996, as the date when United States  military participation in the mandated  mission of the United Nations would  terminate. He has stood by that situa tion and it has been fulfilled.  The goals of the United States policy  have been clear from the outset, that  ",1996

126,Senate,104,0.322,342,7,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President,  I do  thank my friend from Colorado. This  Senate will miss him, and certainly I  will miss him. He  is a very special  friend and one for whom I have come to  have the highest respect and admira tion and affection.  I want  to  thank Senator SHELBY.  Such a  fine ally. I admire him so, a  very steady, thoughtful, extremely au thentic man when he deals with the  issues of the day.  I just say to my friend from Colorado  that I think my colleague from Michi gan was a bit shocked when the Sen ator said we were talking about joining  these  issues. My amendment  is not  about joining the issues. I want to ex press that. This is a singular amend ment based upon  the majority  rec ommendations from  the Jordan com mission. We have seen fit to see that it  is an issue that will be discussed, voted  on, whichever way it goes, and  then  move on.  I  think once we finish  this  amendment,  things will move  in  a  swifter fashion.  But just let me say this to kind of  summarize some things that have oc curred during the debate. Please under stand  that  I  think what my  friend,  Senator FEINGOLD, was talking about- parents-there  is no  change  in my  amendment in the definition of ""imme diate  family,""  none. Parents, minor  children, spouses, no change. That, I  think, is unfortunate; and perhaps it  may have been misconstrued. But there  is no change in the definition of ""im mediate family"" in what I am doing.  I say, too, that in the debate I have  heard  the phrase  that  these  people  come here to work. I agree with that  totally. There was another reference to  the fact  that they are a  tremendous  burden on  the United States. I have  never shared that view.  I have never  shared the view that these people who  come here are a tremendous burden.  But there are some touching stories  here I  just have to comment on. You  knew  that  I would not  completely  allow that to slip away.  We can all  tell  the most  touching  stories that we can possibly conjecture.  My friend from Ohio tells those stories.  My  friend  from Massachusetts  tells  those stories. I can tell those stories,  for I have a brother who is just about  the most wonderful man you can ever  imagine. I would like to have him here.  But the problem is, nobody will raise  the numbers, no one will come to this  floor and say, ""I think legal immigra tion should be 1,000,002."" I do not know  of anybody who is going to come here  and do that. Unless you do that, then I  have to make a choice, which is not  quite as dramatic as Sophie's choice.  That would be a poor illustration. But  I have  to decide whether I want  to  bring my spouse and minor children or  my brother or raise the numbers. That  is where we are. So you either deal  with the priorities or you lift the num bers. There is not much place to go.  -When Senator DEWINE  talks about  this gutsy guy, this gutsy, hard-work ing guy-and that I will remember for  a long time because I know that story  now-that  gutsy,  hard-working  guy  cannot come here,  ladies and gentle men, because 78 percent of the visas  have been used by family connection.  This gutsy, hard-working guy, the peo ple we all think about when we  talk  about immigration,  these people who  come and enrich our Nation, as memo rialized on  the Statue of Liberty by  Emma Lazarus, are not going to get  here, ladies and gentlemen, because 78  percent of the visas are used by family  connection, period. That is where we  are. You  take more or give more.  I  have  the view, which  is consistent,  that we ought  to give  the precious  numbers to the closest family member.  That is the purpose of my amendment.  Senator KENNEDY  talks about  the  adult child who will have to wait, and  it is a poignant story-or the only sis ter of the Cambodian who will not be  able to come for 5 years. I ask my col leagues if you really prefer to admit  brothers and sisters or adult children  while husbands and wives and minor  children are standing in line, who want  to join their family here, who can be  described as ""little kids,"" ""little moth ers, little fathers."" That is what this  is. What kind of a policy is that?  I tell you what kind of a policy it is,  it is our present policy. The present  policy of  the United States  is  that  there  is  a  backlog on  spouses  and  ",1996

These  hos pitals provide critical services to the  Camden community. Now they are pro posing to establish a new pediatric re habilitation center which will address  a vital unmet need in the community.  There are many worthy organizations  seeking  these  empowerment  funds;  however,  this project  is expected  to  provide community based quality care  for children from communities in the  Camden area.

134,Senate,104,0.1,381,7,Mr. COHEN.," I am concerned that sec tion 107 of this bill, which lifts the cap  on the amount of funds that may be ex pended on a customs service program  for small airports, could lead to abuse  of this program and unfair competi tion.  Under current law, all large airports,  such as Bangor International Airport,  which are designated ports of entry,  must charge passengers $6.50 per ticket  to pay for the cost of customs inspec tion and processing. In 1984, Congress  established a program  for small air ports that could not qualify for port-of entry status to enable them to provide  customs services to international pas sengers. Passengers  arriving at air ports that qualify for this program do  not pay the $6.50 fee. Instead, a user-fee  airport pays a user fee directly to the  Customs Service, which goes  into an  account that pays the salaries of the  customs inspector and the cost of cus toms inspections and other services at  ",1996
135,Senate,104,0.446,472,7,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased that today the Senate will pass  H.R.  1743,  a  bill  to  reauthorize  the  Water  Resource  Research  Act,  as  amended by the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works. This is  a small, but vitally important piece of  legislation that gained unanimous sup port in the House of Representatives,  as well as the Environment and Public  Works Committee here in the Senate. I  want  to  thank Senator KEMPTHORNE  and Senator REID,  along with Chair man CHAFEE and Senator BAUCUS  for  working with me to ensure the swift  passage of this legislation. Their hard  work, and that of their staffs, is great ly appreciated.  H.R. 1743 extends the authorization  for the water resources research insti tutes program through the year 2000.  The water resources research institutes  program is a vital Federal/State water  research,  education and  information  transfer  partnership.  This  program  supports a network of institutes at the  land grant colleges in each of the 50  States, 3 trust territories and the Dis trict of Columbia. These institutes are  the primary link between the academic  community, the water-related person nel of the Federal and State govern ment, and the private sector. The insti tutes provide a mechanism to promote  State, regional and national coordina tion of water resources research and  training, as well as information trans fer. This is a very productive program.  In fiscal year 1995,  the Federal appro priation  for  the water  institutes- under S5 million-leveraged  approxi mately $65 million from State, private  and other sources to support the insti tutes research and training activities.  Federal regulations and programs de signed  to solve water problems have  their primary impact at the State and  local  level. State and  local govern ments are in a  far better position to  tailor solutions  to  local water prob lems  than  the Federal Government.  Programs such as the water resources  research institutes are an efficient and  effective way for the Federal Govern ment to assist States to conduct re search and solve problems in the water  resources  field.  In administering  the  State water resources research  insti tute program, the Interior Department  and  the Geological Survey distribute  funds equally among all the institutes.  The State  institutes  then award re search  funds  through a  competitive,  peer review process. Institutes have ad visory panels comprised of local, State,  and Federal water officials, representa tives from water user groups and other  interested parties, which develop year ly research priorities for their States  and  review  the  allocation of  funds  among  various  competing  projects.  This is the true strength of this pro gram. Individual State institutes are  able to focus grants on research that  addresses  the most  pressing water  problems  in  that State. There have  been efforts made  to strengthen  the  competition for  funding between  the  individual water institutes. I have seri ous concerns about that. We must fund  this program at a level that allows us  to maintain the network of institutes  in every State. In addition, we must  preserve the role of the advisory panels  in each State, continuing to allow each  State to determine the research agenda  for themselves. I would hope the De partment of Interior would not impose  new  restrictions on State water  re sources research programs  in  the fu ture.  In addition to the core program, I am  pleased the bill before us contains an  authorization for a second program f o cused on regional issues. I amended the  House bill  to  include  this  important  program, which will allow  the  insti tutes to conduct research of regional,  interstate  issues.  Increasingly  the  water  issues we're asking States  to  deal with are of a regional, interjuris dictional nature. The bill as amended  in committee reauthorizes the section  104(g) program to support this needed  interdisciplinary research and analysis  necessary  for assessing  regional and  interstate water resource problems.  Finally, Mr. President, this bill takes  a realistic look at future funding. This  bill funds the institute programs at a  level more in line with historical ap propriations, reducing the current au thorization by more  than 40 percent  below the current authorized level.  This is a good bill, a good program,  and I'm pleased the Senate is moving  ahead with passage today. I'm hopeful  the House will agree  to our changes  quickly and we can get this bill signed  into law without delay. Thanks again  to the leadership of the Environment  and Public Works Committee for work ing with me on this legislation.   COMMEMORATING THE TENTH AN NIVERSARY OF THE CHERNOBYL  TRAGEDY    ",1996
136,Senate,104,-0.314,472,7,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to solemnly commemorate  the  tenth anniversary of the worst nuclear  accident since the dawn of the nuclear  age.  On April 26, 1986, a flawed structural  design and operator error caused a sud den power surge within reactor number  four at the V.I. Lenin atomic power  plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine.  The resulting chemical explosion va porized nuclear fuel, melted the reac tor's substandard  shell and  released  into the atmosphere a gigantic, 180-ton  cloud of deadly radioactive iodine, ce sium and other lethal  isotopes-con taining 200 times the amount of radio active material  emitted during  the  atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Naga saki.  Within a 4-month period, 31 power  plant employees and cleanup workers  died of acute radiation poisoning. Tens  of thousands of other Ukrainian and  Belarusian men, women and children  suffered  radiation  sickness.  Invisible  fallout-detected as far away as Cali fornia-contaminated  forever  more  than 10 million acres of nearby forests  and farmland, permanently poisoning  the local food chain.  When the magnitude and the severity  of the catastrophe became clear, close  to 200,000 people were hastily and per manently evacuated from the rich, fer tile land which was their home for gen erations.  The Chernobyl  area-once  lush with old-growth  forests  rich  in  mushrooms, berries and other medici nal herbs--is now a 30 kilometer dead  zone.  Human habitation is strictly forbid den.  A decaying, 24-story concrete  tomb  known as the sarcophagus now encases  the destroyed  reactor,  serving as  a  grim reminder of this dark page  in  human history.  A decade  later,  those affected con tinue  to  struggle with  the  lingering  heal th effects. The incidence of adoles cent thyroid cancer throughout north ern Ukraine and nearby Belarus is an  astounding 200 percent higher than av erage, due in part to the consumption  of poisoned milk.  Already 800 children have contracted  the disease, and experts say that as  many as 5,000 will develop it.  The  incidence  of  radiation-related  birth defects in the region has doubled.  A  team of British and Russian sci entists recently concluded that genetic  DNA mutations caused by  radiation  poisoning are being passed along to a  generation of children who did not even  exist at the time of the accident.  Whether these malformations will af fect the future health of these children  is a mystery.  surviving Chernobyl victims  also suffer from a myriad of psycho logical  disorders, more  difficult  to  identify and  treat but every bit as  harmful as the physiological effects of  radiation.  Sadly,  a  recent  study  comparing  mortality rates before and after  the  disaster places the total number of fa talities at roughly 32,000.  Despite these disturbing findings, we  really know very little.  Information on radiation exposure is  incomplete and unreliable, and many  of those affected have moved or relo cated hampering study efforts. Others  may suffer  from yet-to-be diagnosed  diseases caused by prolonged exposure  to unsafe  levels of background radi ation.  It is unlikely that we will ever know  the true scope of this tragedy.  Though two of Chernobyl's four nu clear units remain operational, I am  pleased  that President Clinton  and  Ukrainian President Lenoid Kuchma  agreed to an accord earlier this year to  Many  ",1996

When the residents of my district go to bed  at night, they know that should disaster strike  and  their home catch  fire, well-trained and  qualified volunteer fire departments are ready  and willing to give so graciously and gener ously  of  themselves. This peace  of mind  should not be taken for granted.  By selflessly giving of themselves, they en sure a safer future for us all. We owe these  volunteer fire departments a debt of gratitude  for their service and sacrifice.  TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.  ZALEWSKI  HON. WIWAM 0. LIPINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1996  ",1996
138,,104,-0.176,485,7,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to  pay tribute to an outstanding young man from  my district, Michael J. Zalewski, who was re cently honored for academic excellence at St.  Rita High School.  During St Rita's academic awards banquet,  Mr. Zalewski, a senior bound for the University  of Illinois, was recognized nine times for his  scholastic achievements. He was cited as a  member of the St. Rita 1996 Academic All Stars, a winner of the 1996 Heeney Award, as  an Illinois State scholar, and as a recipient of  the Presidential Educational Award.  Mr. Zalewski was named as a member of  the Gold Honor Roll at St. Rita,  the JETS  Science Team,  the National Honor Society,  and was listed in ""Who's Who Among Amer ican High School Students."" In addition, he re ceived the U.S. Marine Corps Scholastic Ex cellence Award.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  congratulate Michael  J.  Zalewski, and of course his parents, Michael  R.  and Millie Zalewski,  on  his  academic  achievements, and extend to him, as well as  IN  HONOR  HUELBIG:  HERO  OF  A  EDWARD  ""ROY""  TRUE  AMERICAN  HON. ROBERT MENENDFZ  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1996  ",1996
139,,104,-0.362,485,7,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay tribute to Edward ""Roy"" Huelbig, an ex ceptional  individual, who  had distinguished  himself through tireless dedication to the vet erans,  firefighters, and police officers of his  community  in Hoboken and  throughout  the  State of New Jersey. Mr. Huelbig will be hon ored  for his numerous years of service by  United Cerebral Palsy of Hudson County at a  ceremony at the F .A. Mckenzie American Le gion Post 165 in Bayonne, NJ on April 27.  Mr. Huelbig's record of service  to helping  others began in Hoboken, where he was born  and raised. He attended Our Lady of Grace  Grammar School  and  St. Michael's High  School in my hometown of Union City. When  the Nation called, Mr. Huelbig answered by  entering  the U.S. Army  in 1943, where he  served in the European theather of operations  during Wand War II. For his steadfast bravery  in combat, Mr. Huelbig was awarded four bat tle stars and a Purple Heart.  Upon  returning  to  the United States, Mr.  Huelbig was appointed  to the Hoboken Fire  Department in 1948, which benefited from his  valuable contributions as a firefighter for over  25 years. After retiring from a position with the  A-P-A Trucking Co. in 1986, Mr. Huelbig de voted his time to a number of charitable orga nizations. Mr. Huelbig's expertise  in commu nity  involvement has been an  invaluable  re source for a number of groups throughout the  State. While Mr. Huelbig serves as secretary  of the Retired Police and Fireman's Associa tion, it is the veterans of New Jersey who owe  Mr. Huelbig the greatest debt of gratitude. He  is chairman of the Hoboken Elks Lodge 7 4  Veterans' Committee which ""adopts"" five indi viduals at the Veterans Home of Paramus by  celebrating  birthdays  and  Christmas  with  them,  in addition  to organizing  field  trips  to  sporting  events.  A  past  commander, Mr.  Huelbig now serves as legislative chairman of  the Disabled American Veterans Hoboken  Chapter 8, which helps raise funds for the five  veterans hospitals in New Jersey.  Even  though Mr. Huelbig has exhibited a  tremendous commitment to community organi zations, the main focus of his life has been his  family. He was married  to  the  former Ellen  Lynsky who passed away in November 1985.  Mr. Huelbig is the father of three children: a  daughter, Kerryann Ganter, and  two  sons,  Kevin and Roy Huelbig. He is also the proud  grandfather of five.  It is an honor to have such an outstanding  and dedicated  individual as Edward  ""Roy""  Huelbig residing in my district. His efforts are  testimony  to  the  fact  that one person can  make a difference in the lives of others. I ask  my colleagues to join me in recognition of this  true American hero.  HON. JACK METCALF  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1996  ",1996
140,,104,0.384,485,7,Mr. METCALF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to ad dress the House and ask permission to extend  and revise my remarks.  I  am  pleased  to welcome  the Wound,  Ostomy  and  Continence  Nurses  Society  [WOCN]  to Seattle, WA on June 15-19, for  their 28th annual conference. The  theme of  the conference, ""The Future  is Ours  to Cre ate,"" will  focus on  future opportunities and  challenges  relating  to the changing and ex panding role of ET  (enterostomal  therapists)  nurses  and  other  nurses  specializing  in  wound, ostomy, and continence care.  Founded in 1968, the WOCN is the only na tional organization for nurses who specialize in  the prevention of pressure ulcers and  the  management and rehabilitation of persons with  ostomies, wounds, and  incontinence. WOCN  is a professional nursing society which sup ports  its members by promoting educational,  clinical and research opportunities, to advance  the practice and guide the delivery of expert  health  care  to  individuals  with  wounds,  ostomies and incontinence.  In this age of changing health care services  and  skyrocketing  costs,  the WOCN  nurse  plays an integral role  in providing cost-effec tive care to patients. This year's Seattle con ference will provide a unique opportunity for  WOCN participants  to  learn about the most  current issues and trends related to their prac tice. I wish WOCN every success in their con ference.  HONORING THE SOUTH SIDE  VOLUNTEER FIBE DEPARTMENT  HON. BART GORDON  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1996  ",1996
141,House,104,-0.457,498,7,Ms. FURSE.," Mr. Speaker, just prior  to the April recess, my colleague from  Ohio, Ms. KAPTUR,  took to the House  floor and criticized the operations of  Nike, an important Oregon-based com pany headquartered in my district. I  fundamentally disagree with her as sessment of Nike and rise today to set  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  straight.  Simply stated, the company that my  colleague from Ohio portrayed in her  statement is not the company that I  have been working with for the last 31h  years  and  which  has  been  headquartered in my district for  the  last quarter century. In my view, Nike  is a world-class American company,  providing good American jobs, and has  been and continues to be a good cor porate citizen in Oregon.  I find it most unfortunate that the  Congresswoman, nor her staff, nor any one from the jobs and fair trade cau cus, took the time to check with Nike,  to understand their side of the story  before  the statement was given, nei ther did they check with me. So in the  name of fairness, let's look at the alle gations and then the facts, one by one,  to get to the bottom of what this com pany is really about.  First,  it is alleged  that Nike has  downsized its work force and shut down  all of its U.S. production. The fact is  that currently, Nike directly employs  over 5,500  employees  in  the United  States, 3,500 of whom are based in Or egon. This makes Nike one of Oregon's  leading private sector employers. The  majority of these U.S. jobs are profes sional, technical, design, or managerial  positions-highly  skilled  jobs  that  command high wages. It is interesting  to note that on average, Nike employ ees  in Oregon make over $45,000 per  year. That compares very  favorably  with the average Oregon private sector  income of roughly $25,000 per year.  The remainder of Nike's U.S. jobs in clude  customer  service, distribution,  sales,  retail and yes, manufacturing.  With a U.S. production force of nearly  1,800 people, Nike  is the largest pro vider of American manufacturing jobs  among all athletic footwear companies.  This includes Nike's air sole factory in  Beaverton, OR, where 800. Oregonians  are employed making the air cushion ing units which are incorporated into  most of Nike's footwear products. In  addition, it is important to recognize  that Nike sources nearly 70 percent of  the apparel it sells in the United States  within the United States, which trans lates into thousands of additional U.S.  jobs. In total, Nike and its U.S. subsidi aries and subcontractors manufacture  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of  shoes, apparel, accessories, and printed  products in the United States.  And despite what was alleged, Nike  hasn't downsized  its work  force and  moved production overseas. Nike has  always produced its athletic footwear  in Asia, because that is where the ath letic footwear industry-including the  expertise, efficiency, and innovation has always been located. It is true that  in the late 1970's, in an effort to build  a U.S. athletic footwear manufacturing  base, Nike  opened  two  factories  in  Maine and New Hampshire, but that ef fort proved unsuccessful for a variety  of reasons. But what is important to  note is that when those two factories  were running, they employed 825 peo ple-including  those  in research and  ",1996
142,Senate,104,0.506,511,7,Mr. GRAMS.," Mr. President, on behalf  of the American people who aren't here  to stand up for themselves, I ask my  colleagues to stand with me in taking  back Pennsylvania Avenue  from  the  fear to which it has been surrendered.  It's time to halt these efforts to close  off  the people's house, on America's  main street,  from  the people  them selves. We don't need to wait for the re ports and recommendations of another  government commission to know that  this is wrong.  By ordering the immediate reopening  of  Pennsylvania Avenue,  President  Clinton has the power to return the avenue to the people. He has the power to  undo  a  costly mistake. He has  the  power  to ensure  that  the closure of  Pennsylvania Avenue does not mark  its first anniversary.  We must not allow fear to claim the  victory. Dismantle the barricades, Mr.  President, and may the souls of the pa triots who founded this Nation in free dom's name take pity on us if we don't.  ExHIBIT 1  U.S. SENATE,  Washington, DC, April 29, 1996.  Hon. BILL CLINTON,  The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: As you are no doubt  aware, May 20, 1996 will mark the passage of  one year since the closing of Pennsylvania  Avenue  in  front of  the White House. To  eliminate the need for observing this somber  anniversary, I am writing to respectfully re quest the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue  by a date no later than May 17, 1996.  Within the history of Pennsylvania Avenue  can be  traced the history of this great na tion. In 1791, President George Washington  commissioned Pierre Charles L'Enfant to  draft a blueprint for America's new capital  city. They envisioned Pennsylvania Avenue  as a ceremonial boulevard physically linking  the U.S. Capitol and the White House, and  symbolically linking the Legislative and Ex ecutive branches of government. As an inte gral element of the District of Columbia,  Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a  vital, working, unbroken roadway, elevating  it into a place of national  importance as  ""America's Main Street.""  As the home to every president since John  Adams, the White House has become one of  Pennsylvania Avenue's ""crown jewels"" and a  primary destination of visitors to the Na tion's Capital; today, ""the People's House""  is host  to 1.5 million  tourists  annually.  Given  its prominent  location on Pennsyl vania Avenue and its proximity to the Peo ple, the White House has become a powerful  symbol of freedom, openness, and an individ ual's access to their government.  And so you can imagine  the disappoint ment of many when your order of May 20,  1995 closed Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicu lar traffic  for  two blocks  in front of the  White House. By impeding access and impos ing hardships upon tourists, residents of the  District, commuters, and local business own ers and their customers, the closure of Penn sylvania Avenue  has  drastically  altered  L'Enfant's historic city plan, replacing the  openness of the area surrounding the White  House with barricades, additional security  checkpoints, and an atmosphere of fear and  distrust.  The closure has come with not only an  emotional cost, but a financial cost as well both to the taxpayers, who have been asked  to bear the burden of funding new security  measures along Pennsylvania A venue near  the White House, and for those who are de pendent upon access to the avenue for their  livelihood.  I  acknowledge  that  the security of  the  President of the United States is paramount  and a matter not to be taken lightly, but I  ask you to recognize that the need to ensure  the president's safety must be balanced with  the expectation of freedom inherent in a de mocracy. I believe the present situation is  tilted far to heavily toward security at free dom's expense.  In the year since the closure of Pennsyl vania Avenue,  the calls  for  its reopening  ",1996
143,Senate,104,-0.303,537,7,Mr. DASCHLE.,"  I am pleased  to be  able  to respond  to  the Senator from  Massachusetts, that was really the rea son I wanted to come out, to address  that very point. Obviously,  there are  some of our Republican  friends who  would like to make this current debate  out to be a choice between having a  vote on minimum wage or having a de bate on minimum wage and having an  opportunity  to vote on  immigration.  That is a false choice, as the Senator  knows.  There is absolutely no desire on the  part of our Democratic colleagues to  hold up the vote on the very legitimate  question of how we address more effec tively illegal immigration in this coun try. That is the purpose of the bill. I  have heard the Senator from Massa chusetts say on several occasions we  could complete work on that bill in a  day and a half. There was not any need  to extend out this debate. There was  not any need  to  fill  parliamentary  trees in an elaborate fashion to deny  the opportunity  to  raise  these ques tions.  We were prepared to vote on mini mum wage with a half hour of debate.  We could have done it last week. That  was not done. So it is a false choice.  The false choice is that we are being  told it is either one or the other. Well,  they can delay a  vote on minimum  wage, but they cannot deny it. Sooner  or later, this Senate will have the op portunity, as we know we must, to vote  on this moral issue of minimum wage,  to vote on this very important, critical  opportunity to provide people with a  working wage, a realization that it is  those economic pressures  that drive  families apart and give them the kind  of extraordinarily difficult challenges  that they have to face on a daily basis,  because they do not have the economic  wherewithal to pay their bills on rent,  groceries, heat, and all of the things  that every one of us face.  So this is a moral issue. The Senator  is absolutely right to point this out so  ably and eloquently as he has. So it is  not a choice we are willing to accept. It  is a false choice. We will vote on immi gration. We will vote for cloture this  afternoon on the amendment. We will  ensure that we get to the key issues re lating to how we resolve the differences  we have with regard to  illegal immi gration. We will vote on that, and, ulti mately, we will have our vote on one of  the most important moral and family  issues of the day-minimum wage.  So I only answer the distinguished  Senator from Massachusetts that we  recognize  the importance of this bill.  We recognize the importance of getting  on with a  debate about  the amend ments pending, and we will do  that.  And one day we will have our vote on  minimum wage as well.  If it is not  today, it will be tomorrow, this week,  or next week. But we will have our  vote.  ",1996

Charles ""Chuck"" Nicolls in recognition  of his 27 years of service to the students, fac ulty, and fellow employees of Cabrillo College,  located in Aptos, CA.  Mr. Nicolls has served the people of Califor nia as a firefighter and police officer for 27  years. He was employed by the city of Mo desto as a firefighter and fire company engi neer from August 1964 to February 1969.  He then served as a police officer, motor cycle officer, and undercover narcotics officer  from February 1969 to April 1985, often under  perilous  conditions.  Sergeant Nicolls  then  served the Cabrillo Community College from  September 1989 to March 1996, as a police  officer,  training manager, administrative ser geant, and the ""Chief of Barb B-O's"" for all  special events. Sergeant Nicolls established a  training site at Cabrillo College for the Califor nia Motorcycle Safety Training Program. Ser geant Nicolls stayed on-duty for 26 hours after  the Loma Prieto earthquake.    On February 15, 1995 Sergeant Nicolls was  awarded American Police Hall of Fame Distin guished Medal of Honor and citations for his  contributions  to  the community. Throughout  his whole career, Sergeant Nicolls has con sistently demonstrated a sense of honor and  duty, rare in today's world.

147,Senate,104,0.548,654,7,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to  comment on a  provision  that  is  in cluded in the managers' amendment to  S. 1664, the immigration reform bill. I  am pleased to  introduce  this amend ment, which will require verification of  citizenship and/or immigration status  for those applying for housing assist ance. The applicant will have 30 days  to provide proper documentation, or  assistance will not be provided; appli cants who have failed to provide docu mentation in that time will be taken  off the waiting list. For those who al ready receive housing assistance, aver ification of immigration status may be  required at the annual recertification.  Annual recertification for housing as sistance is already required to deter mine income levels, and I would urge  housing authorities to make good use  of this option. If a housing authority  requests verification, a household will  have a 3-month period to obtain proper  documentation or assistance will be  terminated. Once the 3-month appeal is  exhausted, a hearing may be granted in  the fourth month. It is important to  note that political refugees and asylum  seekers are exempt from my proposal.  The amendment I offer  today passed  the House  immigration  reform  bill  unanimously as part of the managers'  amendment.  In 1980, Congress passed the Housing  and  Community Development  Act,  which included a section prohibiting il legal  aliens  from  receiving Federal  housing assistance.  In 1995,  15 years  after the bill passed, HUD issued regu lations to implement the 1980 changes.  Its regulations, however, will do little  to prohibit illegal aliens from continu ing to receive taxpayer-supported hous ing.  Under  current  regulations,  illegal  aliens can be placed on a waiting list  and  then granted housing assistance  without having to provide documenta tion proving that they are eligible to  receive the assistance. If a household is  not eligible to continue receiving as sistance currently it may appeal  the  decision in 3-month increments for up  to 3 years. That is 3 years of taxpayer  assistance for someone who may not be  eligible to receive the funds.  In my home State of Arizona, offi cials of the Maricopa Housing Author ity (which is primarily Phoenix) told  me  that, by their estimates, fully 40  percent of the people receiving housing  assistance in Maricopa County are ille gal. In Maricopa County, there are 1,334  Section 8 units and 917 public housing  units available. The waiting  list for  units has 6,556 on it. If 40 percent of the  current  occupants  are  illegal,  that  means  900  housing units  should be  made  available  to  those  citizens or  legal immigrants waiting their turn.  The problem in Arizona is dramatic;  nationwide it is even more dramatic. In  his report entitled ""The Net National  Costs  of  Im.migration,"" Dr. Donald  Huddle of Rice University estimates  that the cost of public housing pro vided to illegal immigrants in 1994 was  roughly $500 million.  Even  President  Clinton  acknowl edged that there is a problem. When  proposing guidelines for public housing  this year, he. said most public housing  residents have jobs and try to be good  parents, and,  that it is unfair to let  lawbreakers ruin neighborhoods, espe cially since there are waiting lists to  get into public housing. ""Public hous ing has never been a right,"" he said,  but rather ""it has always been a privi lege. The only people who deserve to  live  in public housing are  those who  live responsibly there and  those who  honor the rule of law.""  The public housing authorities, of  course, are the entities that will have  to implement any new policy we enact.  I contacted the housing authorities of  Tempe, Yuma, Tucson, and Maricopa  County. Not one of  the housing au thorities disagreed with my proposal.  They all said that once an applicant or  resident checks on an affidavit that he/  she is a legal citizen, they are not al lowed to pursue the issue. The housing  authorities currently only ask for ver ification of immigration status if the  applicant checks that he/she is an im migrant.  This  amendment  will  curb  the  amount of housing assistance-paid for  by  taxpayers-going  to  illegal  immi grants. It will return housing opportu nities to  the people who are here le gally. I  thank my colleagues for sup porting this amendment.  ",1996

152,House,104,-0.631,706,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, it is a  joy  to get a chance to speak to SAM when  he has to sit and listen to us.  Mr. Speaker, I have worked with SAM  my entire 22 years on the Committee  on Ways and Means. It is interesting.  SAM opposed expanding the Committee  on Ways and Means when all of us new  youngsters came on  the committee.  They had a nice little club and they  really did not want to add to it.  But once the caucus worked its will  and the Committee on Ways and Means  learned about democracy and expanded  its membership, SAM  turned out to be  the fairest of the titans on that com mittee for opening up and sharing the  responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, he wrote the rules for  that committee which stand  today I  think as a mark for other committees  in its fairness and its openness. And  many of us who worked with SAM for so  long remember that. He could oppose  you and he is not shy and he is willing  to speak out. And unlike some of us, he  does not need to learn more diplomacy  and reticence because he has Martha,  and Martha has been able to keep SAM  mellow and happy when he has been  fighting like hell for something that he  believes in.  Mr. Speaker, SAM wrote the rules for  the Committee on Ways and Means. He  is an expert on trade. Then in the last  Congress when we were attempting to  pass welfare reform, SAM sat through  every markup with our subcommittee,  even though he was not on that com mittee, and when the bill came to full  committee  it was  the expertise not  only from his experience as he had been  with Medicare from the time he voted  for it as an original bill but from all  the service on the Committee on Ways  and Means he was able to help us pull  together that coalition that was able  to present  to  the American public a  health care bill that was fair, did not  increase  the deficit,  and opened up  heal th coverage to every American.  I hope, SAM that he can provide that  for you in your retirement and you can  come back and share with us when  under the leadership that you set, and  the goal you set for us with the Presi dent, we will accomplish that.  God bless you, SAM. We will miss  you.  SAM GIBBONS: AN IDEAL CITIZEN  ",1996

Preservation of the program was used  as a bargaining chip  in 1993 by  the  White House, the Clinton White House,  to ensure passage of the Clinton tax  hike.

158,House,104,-0.321,732,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  there are some very good human rights  provisions here, as my colleague from  New Jersey mentioned. The gentleman  from New York [Mr. GILMAN], is a very  good chairman of the Committee on  International Relations.  This bill, nonetheless, still needs to  be defeated. It has gone through a revi sion. It is better than it was when we  first were presented with it, but it still  should be vetoed, principally because it  infringes on  the President's right  to  conduct foreign policy. It microman ages foreign policy. It forces the con solidation of agencies. It basically tells  the President that he has to eliminate  agencies to conduct foreign policy.  Mr.  Speaker,  it  also  authorizes  spending levels that would force other  organizations in the international di plomacy  area  to  retreat.  In  other  words, we  are  retreating  as  inter nationalists  through  some  of  the  spending provisions in this bill. Plus,  the bill fails to provide necessary flexi bility for the administration to man age all of these agencies that this bill  is ordering virtually be dismantled.  The bill also hurts in very key areas  in the funding levels: Arms control and  nonproliferation,  international peace keeping,  international  organizations,  public diplomacy, sustainable develop ment. What this is going to cause is a  severe  reduction  in  force  of highly  skilled personnel at several of our for eign affairs agencies.  Mr. Speaker, the bill messes with our  China policy. We do not need right now  to get  into China policy. Things are  very delicate there. We do not need to  repudiate what President Nixon and  Secretary of State Kissinger, then Na tional Security Adviser Kissinger, pre ceded with  in  the Taiwan Relations  Act. What we have now is a new ven ture, a new China policy, which is not  in this bill what we should be doing at  this moment.  Relations with Vietnam,  this  is a  very, very sticky issue. The last thing  we want  to do  is deter and  impede  progress on the POW-MIA issue. It is  coming. It is coming slowly. I do not  think we want to provoke a  reaction  that  is going  to stymie any further  progress.  On participation in international or ganizations, Mr. Speaker, I am a mem ber of the Permanent Select Commit tee on Intelligence.  I  think we have  some good safeguards right now that  deal with  intelligence  sharing with  U.N. agencies. We do not need further  micromanagement of this issue.  On  housing  guaranteed  programs:  South Africa, Eastern Europe,  some  very good country programs in these  nations. Section 111 would  terminate  several of these programs, specifically  as I said before,  in South Africa and  Eastern Europe. And family planning,  this bill is not a good bill.  ",1996
159,House,104,0.32,745,7,Ms. PRYCE.," Mr. Speaker, last week I  came  to  this  floor  to announce my  hopes that some minor changes can be  made to the Indian Child Welfare Act  so  that  it will no  longer have  the  chilling effect it does on adoptions in  this Nation and so that it serves the in terests of children first.  Last week I told of the heart wrench ing story of the Rost family from my  own district  in Col um bus, OH,  and  their still unresolved battle to adopt  the twin girls they have had for almost  3 years now. The girls, unbeknownst to  the Rosts, turned out to be 1/32 Pomo  Indian due to blood from a great-great great-grandparent. The twins and their  adoptive parents still fear the day that  the courts rule the twins be returned  to  a  dysfunctional  abusive  environ ment due to a  twisted, inaccurate, yet  far too common application of the In dian Child Welfare Act.  Today I want to share with you an other of the countless horror stories I  have heard from all over our country.  This case  took place in the State of  Washington, where  the Quinn  family  spent 31/2 years fighting for custody of  their son, Loren.  This couple had worked with a 14year-old  biological  mother  for  7  months prior  to  the birth of a baby  boy. They were even present to cele brate the birth mother's 15th birthday.  The prospective parents attended the  birth of the little boy at the invitation  of the birth mother and and later took  him  into  their home,  honoring her  wishes. There they loved and nurtured  him.  Weeks  later,  they got  the horrible  message, the worst fear of all adoptive  parents, that nightmare that becomes  a  reality, that the birth mother had  changed her mind and wanted the child  back.  Although she had voluntarily relin quished custody of her child, even cho sen this couple, she attempted to re verse her decision under  the  Indian  Child Welfare Act by retroactively en rolling with the Cherokee Nation.  It took 31/2 years to finally reach a  conclusion in the courts, 31/2 years of  horror, sleepless nights and worry of  the unknown for this family who want ed nothing more than to provide a se cure and happy home for the little boy  they loved so much.  Mr. Speaker, night feedings, diapers,  pediatricians, bottles and baths, birth day parties,  first steps, bedtime sto ries, bedtime prayers, colic, car seats,  first words and lullabies, on and on and  on, these are the joys of a family. But  for 31/2 years the normal joy was some what subdued, because for 31h years the  future of this family was unknown.  He would have been removed  from  the  only home  and  family he  ever  knew, and, Mr. Speaker, many courts  have ruled this way. They misinterpret  the intent of !CW A, take these children  and send them to strange places. Now,  we must ask ourselves, is this what is  in the best interest of the children in volved?  Is  this what  ICWA was  in tended to do?  Mr. Speaker, not only the legislative  history but  common  sense  dictates  that  the answer  is no. Very simple,  minor reforms to the Indian Child Wel fare Act would clarify these ambigu ities. Membership in the tribe would be  effective  from  the date of admission  and could not be applied retroactively  as  in  the case of the Rests and  the  Quinns and countless others.  Mr. Speaker, ICWA was intended to  stop State  court  abuses  of  native  American  children  in  involuntary  placements. It was needed and well in tended at the time. But it was not in tended to interrupt voluntary adoption  proceedings. As it is currently written,  !CW A is a factor in every single adop tion in this country because it is hard  to say, and almost impossible to deter mine what  child may or may not,  through some remote part of its herit age, be  some part Native American.  And who can prepare for a  law being  applied retroactively, no matter how  diligent and careful?  The  simple and minor changes  to  !CW A will preserve  the intent of the  act, ensuring the culture and heritage  of Native Americans, and at the same  time protect the rights of birth par ents, adoptive parents, and, above all,  the children.  Mr. Speaker, I can almost guarantee  that every Member in this body has at  least one case of a  judicial abuse of  !CW A in their districts. I urge my col leagues to support these changes. Con gress created these ambiguities, with  all  the best intentions,  in 1978. It is  time for Congress to correct them and  stop the heartbreak.  FIRST LADY'S FINGERPRINTS ON  BILLING RECORDS  ",1996
160,House,104,0.585,745,7,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speak er, Newsweek magazine reported  this  week that the FBI had discovered Mrs.  Hillary Rodham Clinton's fingerprints  on billing records from  the Rose  law  firm discovered at the White House in  January. These billing  records have  been under subpoena and could not be  found for over 2 years. Nobody knew  where  they were. And yet,  just  re cently,  they were found  in President  Clinton  and Mrs. Clinton's personal  residence at the White House by Mrs.  Clinton's secretary.  Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is  investigating  to determine  if anyone  obstructed  justice by hiding the sub poenaed  records. The billing  records  supply  important  information  about  Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison Guar anty Savings & Loan and  the Castle  Grande real estate projects. Arkansas  Governor Jim Guy Tucker, who at the  time  this was  taking place was  the  Lieutenant Governor under President  Clinton, is on trial right now in Arkan sas for fraud because he defaulted on  loans over $1 million related to Castle  Grande.  Now, Mrs. Clinton was  the billing  partner at the Rose Law Firm for the  Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan ac count. However, she stated in a sworn  statement to the Resolution Trust Cor poration that she did very little work  for Madison Guaranty and could not re call the Castle Grande project.  ",1996

163,,104,-0.204,901,7,Mr. GORDON of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker, I  am taking this opportunity to applaud the  in valuable services provided by the Pea Ridge  Volunteer Fire Department. These brave, civic minded people give freely of their time so that  we may all feel safer at night.  Few realize the depth of training and hard  work  that goes  into being a volunteer  fire fighter. To quote one of my  local volunteers,  ""These fireman must have an overwhelming  desire to do for others while expecting nothing  in return.""  Preparation includes twice monthly training  programs in which they have live drills, study  the  latest videos  featuring  the  latest in  fire fighting  tactics, as well as attend seminars  where  they can obtain  the knowledge  they  need to save lives. Within a year of becoming  a volunteer firefighter, most attend  the Ten nessee  fire  training school  in Murfreesboro  where  they undergo further,  intensified train ing.  When the residents of my district go to bed  at night, they know that should disaster strike  and  their home catch  fire, well  trained and  qualified volunteer fire departments are ready  and willing to give so graciously and gener ously  of  themselves. This peace  of mind  should not be taken for granted.  By selflessly giving of themselves, they en sure a safer future for us all. We owe these  volunteer fire departments a debt of gratitude  for their service and sacrifice.  ",1996
164,Senate,104,-0.308,940,7,Mr. FEINGOLD.," This has been a good  debate. It appears to be winding down.  Let me just add a couple responses to  the comments of  the Senators  from  Wyoming and Massachusetts.  One  of  the words  that has  been  kicked around here is the word ""per mission."" Does  this employer  identi fication system,  if it  is fully  imple mented, require permission  from  the  Federal Government for an employer  to hire somebody? It has been sort of  muddying the issue.  I suppose you could call the current  system, asking for ""permission."" It is  kind of a loose use of the word, because  what is required now with the I-9 is the  obtaining of a certain kind of identi fication card. But what it does not in clude-and  this  is  the phrase  I used  when I spoke; I did not just say ""per mission,"" I said, ""having to ask per mission from Washington, DC."" That is  what this system that could arise from  this proposal may create.  What happens now is the employer  does not have to get on the phone or  through a computer to find out some thing from a national databank. That  is a big difference. Ask anybody who  tries to run a small business or a farm  how  they are going  to  like  the  idea  that,  in addition  to everything else  they have  to do now  to  try to keep  their business going, every time they  want  to hire somebody under one of  these alternatives, they would have to  either call Washington or they would  have to communicate with Washington  through some other system, such as a  computer system.  Who is going to pay for all those sys tems? Who is going to make up for the  lost  time of  the employer who has  these additional burdens? It is very im portant  to distinguish here between  what is current law and what this bill  could do  if  this amendment  is not  adopted-getting  permission  from  Washington, DC. I think that is a fair  statement of what  this adds  to  this  bill.  How can  this possibly square with  the rhetoric and legislation proposed in  the 104th Congress? Whatever happened  to  the notion that we should not do  more unfunded mandates from Wash ington, especially on small businesses?  Whatever happened  to  the notion of  regulatory reform, which almost every  Senator at least paid lip service  to?  This seems to be one of the biggest po tential unfunded mandates  that has  ever been proposed on this floor.  I am confident that almost no em ployer in the State of Wisconsin would  feel comfortable with the notion that  suddenly,  in addition  to  everything  else they have to do, they have to call  up Washington under this. If there is  any ambiguity involved about the pos sibility that this might occur, I refer  to page 26 of the bill, and subsection  (E), where it explicitly states that one  of  the  things  that could be done  in  these pilot projects is to create the fol lowing:  A system that requires employers to verify  the validity of employee social security ac count numbers through a telephone call, and  to verify employee identity through a United  States passport, a State driver's license or  identification  document,  or  a  document  issued by  the Service for purposes of this  clause.  So it is explicit in the bill. It is not  just  some  objectives, general  objec tives, as the Senator from Massachu setts was reading earlier.  You go 13 pages later, there are the  explicit approaches that are permitted.  One of those approaches is to put in  place a pilot program that presumably  would lead to a national program re quiring every employer to essentially  call Washington after they have hired  someone. I think this is very troubling  and certainly something that should be  removed from the bill.  Another comment that I found inter esting was the comment of the Senator  from Wyoming. He said that if this sys tem costs $10 billion, it would be worth  ",1996

166,Senate,104,-0.141,966,7,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr. President,  I  would like to congratulate all of the  Members  and  their  staff who  have  worked  so hard on collaborating on  this omnibus package. In particular, I  would like to  thank my good friend,  the majority leader from Kansas,  for  his persistent efforts to shepherd this  bill into law. He has done a great serv ice for many of us, and the bill's final  passage is a testament to his strength  and tenacity as a leader.  I would like to say a few words about  a couple of the bills, that have specific  meaning to me.  The Presidio bill, the flagship of this  package, offers a unique, creative, and  innovative approach to provide for the  long-term protection and preservation  of one of our Nation's greatest cul tural, historical, and natural treasures.  Many people have been waiting a long  time for this bill. I know the Senators  from California  and Congresswoman  PELOSI have put a great deal of time  and  energy  into  this  legislation, as  have the staff from the Energy Com mittee and personal offices. In our ef forts to try to reach consensus on all  levels, we have managed to craft a bill  that will provide enough balance and  flexibility to incorporate all points of  view.  Mr. President, I also would like to  discuss several bills within the omni bus package that are of particular in terest to me and my home State of Col orado. These bills deserve distinction  in their own right, being crafted with  years of collaborative hard work and  dedication. I would like to make brief  comments on each of them, and once  again send my congratulations to all  those who have worked  so hard on  these important bills.  The Rocky Mountain National Park  Visitor Center  title provides  the au thority for the National Park Service  to use appropriated and donated funds  to operate a visitor center outside of  the boundary of Rocky Mountain Na tional Park. The Park Service has been  in need of a visitor's center at the east ern entrance to Rocky for many years  now, but due to fiscal constraints, they  have been unable to get adequate ap propriations. Thanks to a generous pri vate-public partnership proposal,  the  Park Service has an opportunity  to  provide a visitor service outside of the  park boundaries. This legislation sim ply allows the Park Service to enter  into this type of partnership with pri vate individuals. I would particularly  like to applaud the individuals in Estes  Park, whose innovative work, generous  contributions, and persevering dedica tion have made this idea a reality.  This  type  of private-public oppor tunity  is exactly what  the Federal  Government should be  taking advan tage of these days, and I am encour aged by  the proposal for  this visitor  center that has been put forth. This  center would help  the  thousands of  visitors  that come  to  the park each  year, and would save the Government  millions in taxpayer dollars.  The Cache La Poudre title, sponsored  by  the distinguished  senior Senator  from  Colorado,  designates  approxi mately 35,000 acres between the cities  of Fort Collins and Greeley, CO, as the  Cache La Poudre River National Water  Heritage Area. The headwaters of the  streams that flow into this river tell  the story of water development and  river basin management in the West ward expansion of the United States.  This historical area holds  a  special  meaning  for Coloradans, and we  feel  that it deserves national recognition as  a heritage area. In addition to the des ignation,  this  title helps establish a  local commission to develop and imple ment a long-term management plan for  the area.  This bill holds great distinction for  me, for I have been working on it for  many years with my good friend and  colleague, Senator BROWN  from Colo rado. The good Senator has been work ing hard to get this bill enacted into  law, and each revision of the bill has  been a more worthy product than the  last. There are always a couple of bills  that hold special meaning for us per sonally, and the Cache La Poudre is a  good example of one  that the senior  Senator from Colorado has a particular  interest in. It would be a great honor  to have this bill enacted into law be fore my friend retires this year.  The Giplin County Land Exchange  title represents the best type of land  exchange  possible.  It  is  a  simple,  straightforward land exchange bill that  will convey 300 acres of Bureau of Land  Management  lands  in Gilpin County,  CO, for the acquisition of 8,733 acres of  equal value within the State.  The bill seeks to address a site-spe cific land management problem that is  a result of the scattered mining claims  of the 1800's. The Federal selected lands  for conveyance are contained within  133 scattered parcels near the commu nities of Black Hawk and Central City,  most of which are less than one acre in  ",1996

168,House,104,-0.351,1031,7,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, there is  one big question in relation to the gas  tax, and that is if we are going to re peal  the 4.3  cent gasoline  tax, how  much of the reduction, if any, will the  consumer see?  If the market is not working,  then  consumers will not see much of it at  all, and there are indications that the  free market in the area of big oil is not  working.  Today I will be sending a  letter to  the  Justice Department  seeking an swers to three questions: First, why did  the prices spike so quickly, when we all  knew there was cold winter months ago  and when  this  idea  that Iraq would  dump oil has been known for several  months as well? That does not explain  a 1-week dramatic rise.  Second, if there is a true free market  why did not a couple of the companies:  at least one of the big ones, decide to  keep  the price  low and compete on  price and increase their market share?  That is what Adam Smith would tell us  they would do.  Third, most vexing of all, when the  price of crude goes up, the price of gas oline goes up immediately. But when  the price of crude on  the wholesale  market goes down, the price of gasoline  hardly goes down at all, and if it does,  it is slow and grudging.  Until we answer these questions, Mr.  Speaker, we are not going to know if  the consumers would benefit. And if we  can answer  these  questions,  drivers  will save hundreds of dollars at  the  pump, not just the 4.3 cents of the gas  tax.

Mr. Speaker, I represent a portion of  southern California where people are  paying almost $2 a gallon for gasoline.  That is right, $2. That is ridiculous.  The people are angry. The people are  even angrier when they find out that  Congress slapped a  tax on gasoline to  pay  for  numerous  social  programs.  That is right, Congress increased the  gasoline tax in 1993 to pay for numer ous additional social programs.  In the past, the gas tax worked fine  because all of the moneys went to fix ing highways and potholes. What hap pens today? Only a fraction of the gas  tax money is spent on highways and  bridges. That is the problem.  My position is simple. If we are not  going  to  fix  the highways,  then we  should not collect this gas tax money.  Let me tell you how we are going to  lower the cost of gasoline. It is simple.  Let us repeal the Clinton gas tax in crease of 1993.

And, folks, the time has come. It is  time for us to move along and this is  an excellent way to dismantle big Gov ernment.  This bill, secondly, promotes and en courages competition. It has the sup port,  and, Mr. Speaker,  I  hope  the  Members are listening to this, it has  the support of these groups: The Amer ican Farm Bureau.

175,,104,-0.472,1135,7,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  important new  long-term research shows that acid rain negaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tively impacts soil chemistry, which in turn has  a deleterious effect on our Nation's  forests.  This ground-breaking study was conducted by  Dr. Gene E. Likens, the director of the Institute  of Ecosystem Studies  in Millbrook, NY. Dr.  Likens' findings were recently published in the  respected professional  journal, Science. Dr.  Likens' work continues to provide and sustain  the policymaking process. As an elected offi cial, I am grateful for his positive efforts.  Whereas earlier research has suggested a  link between acid rain and harmful impacts on  deciduous forests,  the Likens study provides  more  conclusive  evidence  of  the  damage  caused by acid rain.  On Monday, April 22, we celebrated  the  26th Earth Day. Let me remind my colleagues  that every day is Earth Day  for those of us  who are entrusted by the American people to  protect and conserve our Nation's natural re sources. We must be responsible stewards of  the environment and we have an obligation to  use  the best possible science and  insights  available to us when making critical decisions  affecting  America's  natural  treasures.  Dr.  Likens' study provides important new informa tion concerning pollution and forests.  I am in cluding a New York Times article about the  Likens study for the RECORD.  I hope my col leagues will  take a few minutes to read this  important article on the topic of acid rain:  [From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 1996)  THE FOREST THAT STOPPED GROWING: TRAIL  IS TRACED TO ACID RAIN  (By William K. Stevens)  In the first long-term study of its kind, re searchers have found  that a New England  forest whose soil chemistry has been altered  by acid  rain  essentially  stopped growing  nearly a decade ago and will probably be a  long time in recovering.  The impact of acid rain on American for ests has been a contentious subject. A 10year Federal assessment of the problem con cluded  in 1990  that with some exceptions,  there was no clear evidence linking acid pre cipitation to any important harmful effect  on forests. Many scientists objected, arguing  that the impact of changes in soil chemistry  was not yet clear but that those changes  would probably be damaging  in  the  long  term.  Now  investigators have  examined more  than three decades of data from the Hubbard  Brook Experimental Forest  in  the White  Mountains of New Hampshire and discovered  that increased acidity has deprived the soil  of alkaline chemicals, mainly calcium, that  are essential for plant growth. At the same  time, they found that the annual rate of ac cumulation of forest biomass-its total plant  material-dropped to nearly zero in 1987 and  has remained there. Finally, they discovered  that the soil was recovering its calcium and  other alkaline chemicals very slowly because  precipitation contains about 80 percent less  of them than it is estimated to have con tained in 1950.  The alkaline chemicals, or cations (pro nounced CAT-ions), are leached from the soil  by acid precipitation and carried away by  streams. The precipitation contains sulfuric  acid and nitric acid, produced by the burning  of coal, oil and gasoline. A major source of  these chemicals raining down on the North east has been the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen  oxides emitted by Midwestern power plants  and borne eastward by prevailing winds; they  form sulfuric acid and nitric acid when they  mix with water.  9987  Congress amended  the Clean Air Act  in  1990 in an effort to cut the emission of sulfur  dioxide and nitrogen oxides in half by 2000.  But the findings  from  the Hubbard Brook  forest suggest that this will not be enough if  forests are to recover any time soon, said Dr.  Gene E. Likens, the leader of the study.  Dr. Likens, an ecologist, is the director of  the  Institute  of  Ecosystem  studies  at  Millbrook, N.Y.,  a nonprofit research and  educational institution formerly associated  with the New York Botanical Garden. The  institute has been collecting a wide range of  data since 1963 on  the functioning of the  Hubbard Brook  forest,  a  7,500-acre  tract  owned by the United States Forest Service.  It is one of only a  few ecological research  projects looking at ecosystem behavior over  the long term, and it is probably the only  one to come up with decades-long detailed  measurements on the effects of acid rain on  American forests.  The report of the new findings appears in  the current issue of the journal Science. It  was prepared by Dr. Likens, Dr. Charles T.  Driscoll of Syracuse University and Donald  C. Buso of the Millbrook institution.  ""It's just a  landmark paper,""  said Dr.  David Schindler, a prominent acid-rain re searcher at the University of Alberta in Ed monton, Canada.  ""Hubbard Brook has  the  only data set that's thorough enough and  long enough to show this happening.""  Until now, Dr. Schindler said, the idea that  acid rain is harming deciduous forests has  amounted  to a  ""robust"" hypothesis. The  Hubbard Brook results are ""the clincher,"" he  said, adding: ""I think there's concern for the  whole northeastern United States and east ern Canada that this is occurring.""  Some other researchers were more cau tious. ""The large majority of forests in the  eastern U.S. seem to be growing quite well,""  said Dr. Jay S. Jacobson, a plant physiolo gist at the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cor nell University. While the Hubbard Brook re sults are suggestive, he said, other factors  should be considered before reaching a firm  conclusion on the effects of acid rain. These  include  the effects on  forests of climatic  changes and possible changes in the deposi tion of nitrogen, a critical forest nutrient.  Assuming that forests are recovering slow ly, Dr. Jacobson said, ""are we as a nation  willing to accept slower growth of forests in  order to avoid placing additional controls on  emissions of pollutants?""  In their paper,  the Millbrook researchers  stopped short of asserting a firm cause-and effect relationship between the depletion of  cations in the soil and the slowing of forest  growth. Pinpointing the cause of the slow  growth, they wrote, ""should become a major  area of research."" Dr. Likens said, ""If indeed  the forests has become limited in its growth  by the disappearance of these base cations- and I emphasize the 'if-then that's a very  serious implication of these results.""  Dr. Likens compared  the action of acid  rain in depleting the soil of cations with that  of stomach acid eroding an antacid tablet. In  the case of the Hubbard Brook forest's soils,  he said, ""it's like half the antacid has been  eroded away, and you've only got half of it  left."" The continuing deposition of acid is  making the system even less able to neutral ize it. ""The system is now very sensitive,""  he said.  The observed  effects on  soil  chemistry  were unexpected, Dr. Likens said, and nei ther those effects nor other data based on  long-term observations were reflected in the  10-year Federal  study,  the National Acid  Precipitation  Assessment  Program.  The  ",1996
176,House,104,0.282,1148,7,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to express my concern about one of the  [Mr. DAVIS]  budget procedures attached in both the  President's budget and now under con sideration by the House Committee on  the Budget that continues a delay on  the cost-of-living allowance for Federal  workers of 3 months.  As you know, in this last Congress a  terrible mistake was made when Fed eral employees were singled out, not  Social Security recipients, Federal em ployees were singled out for delays in  the cost-of-living allowance to Federal  retirees for 3 months. Military retirees  were treated to a 6-month delay. It was  a terrible mistake. There was no COLA  equity, and I think Members on both  sides of the aisle recognize this is not  the way we want to do business.  Then comes the administration budg et for this year that continues a defer ral  for Federal  retirees, and at this  point, as I understand, under the Com mittee on  the Budget's recommenda tions, the military retirees will receive  no COLA delay, Social Security will re ceive no COLA delay, but Federal retir ees once again are singled out for a  delay in the cost-of-living allowance,  and that will be continued. A terrible  mistake has been made once and they  want to continue this, or at least some  Members at this point are looking at  this as a way to try to bring down the  deficit.  The difficulty with this of course is  that Federal employees and  retirees  have already given over $150 billion to ward the deficit in terms of benefits  since 1980. They continue to be willing  to give on a fair and reasonable basis.  But this last year has seen an assault  on Federal employees and retirees as  we have never seen before.  Of course,  they are undergoing the  downsizing that every other organiza tion and State and local governments  are going through across this country.  But at the same time, they have been  threatened with  the  loss of benefits.  They were going  to raise  the retire ment contribution, basically a 2.5-per cent pay cut this body passed at one  point, but fortunately was killed over  in the other body. There was an effort  to take their retirement and figure it  on the high 5 years instead of the high  3 years. There were going to be caps on  the health benefit plan. There were  going to be caps on making them pay  for parking that civilian employees get  for free. But we defeated most of that  at this point. Then, of course, we had  the terrible furloughs in November and  December.  In every other organization through out this country people are recognizing  your employees are the essential com ponent of being able  to deliver  the  service to your customer. But here at  the Federal level, we do not understand  that. We end up treating our own em ployees and retirees as if somehow this  is just another pocket to be picked, in stead of one of the strongest assets this  Government has.  I hope as we entertain the budget de liberations this year, that we will not  look to the Federal retirees to give un fairly and single  them out for COLA  adjustments. Many Federal retirees do  not get Social Security. If they are  under  the Civil  Service Retirement  System, they do not get Social Secu rity. They worked for the Federal Gov ernment and as a result of that gave up  their rights  to Social Security. Why  should their cost-of-living allowance be  attacked, and other retirees who by  reason of the fact they did not work for  the Government would continue?  COLA equity is the byword. Every body is willing to pay on a fair, level  playing field. But this Congress owes it  to our Federal retirees and employees  for fair treatment. We have not been  fair  in  this  last year. We can begin  anew.  I hope  the Committee on  the  Budget in their final deliberations will  look for COLA equity across the board.  STALEMATE WITH FREEMEN  SHOULD END  ",1996
177,House,104,-0.216,1148,7,Mr. CLEMENT.," Mr. Speaker, I have  watched and deliberated and  thought  about what is happening in Montana  with the Freemen, and more and more  it is bothering me. It bothers me, be cause all of us have to live under the  laws of the land. A lot of the laws, we  do not like; a lot of the rules and regu lations, we want to change; but there is  a way to go about it.  The New York Times reported that  the leader of the Freemen has collected  over $676,000  in Federal farm supports  over the past 10 years. It is all right for  him to denounce the Federal Govern ment, but the fact is, he is living off  the Federal Government.  These  Freemen  that  occupy  this  property in Montana, they do not own  that  property.  Somebody  else  owns  that property. And what about the peo ple that own that property? They are  about  to  lose  that property because  they have a big mortgage to pay. They  need to plant a crop. They need to cul tivate the land. They need to do some thing with that land. And yet they can not even get on that land because we  keep continuing to delay.  Now, I realize our reluctance. I real ize maybe some mistakes were made in  Waco, maybe  some mistakes were  made at Ruby Ridge. But the Federal  Government,  the Government, finally  has to act or react. They cannot keep  postponing and delaying, knowing that  by doing nothing we are not complying  with the laws and we are infringing on  the majority's rights.  Sure, we want to protect the minori ty's rights, and, my goodness, I have  supported much legislation to protect  the minority's rights. I realize a lot of  ",1996

This beautiful  building  is  the  living symbol of my State's  proud history and  the important contributions  that Connecticut and its people have made to  our Nation. The Old State House, long recog nized as ""Connecticut's single most important  building,"" has now been rehabilitated and re newed after a 4-year, carefully orchestrated  major construction project. All of Connecticut  will celebrate its rebirth on May 11, 1996.  Nestled  in  the heart of what is now down town Hartford and today surrounded by mod ern office buildings, the site of the Old State  House was a cradle of colonial history even  before the building existed.  In 1638, the Rev.  Thomas Hooker preached a sermon there that  led  to  the adoption of Connecticut's colonial  constitution. These Fundamental Orders of  Connecticut later became the blueprint for the  U.S. Constitution.  In 1781, at Meeting House  Square, Gen. George Washington met  the  French armies  in America under Comte de  Rochambeau and  forged  the Yorktown strat egy  that  led  to victory  in  the Revolutionary  War.  Eleven years  later, construction began on  the Old State House. Designed by Charles  Bulfinch, the building was completed in 1796.  On May 11 of that year,  it was dedicated by  Connecticut's Revolutionary War  statesman  and first Governor, Oliver Wolcott.  For the next 82 years, the Old State House  was the scene of both glorious and tragic mo ments in Connecticut's history. Here, the noto rious Amistad trial took place; here they draft ed the laws to incarcerate Prudence Crandall.  But here,  too, Oliver Ellsworth  resigned as  U.S. Senator to become the third Chief Justice  of  the U.S. Supreme Court. Here, Lafayette  and Marshall Foch were honored. Here, Con necticut's constitutional conventions were held,  first in 1818 and again, in 1965. Here, nine sit ting Presidents of  the United States visited:  John Adams, James Monroe, Andrew Jack son, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulys ses Grant, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy  Carter, and George Bush.  When  the State outgrew  the building  in  1878,  the Old State House served as Hart ford's city hall for 37 years.  It was later used  as a community center for the Red Cross, the  Chamber  of Commerce,  and  the Hartford  Symphony. When the Connecticut River flood ed, the Old State House was a dry shelter on  high ground. In wartime, it was a bond center.  And always, it has served the citizens of Con necticut.  Now, on the 200th anniversary of its open ing, the Old State House will again be a lively  presence in the center of Connecticut's capital  city. Under the visionary stewardship of Wilson  H. Faude, the executive director of the ConEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  necticut Old State House, and the Old State  House Association,  the building has under gone a $12-million metamorphosis  that will  usher in a new era of living history, art and  museum exhibits, educational programs and  entertainment. Citizens of Hartford, CT, and  the Nation celebrate the rebirth of this  land mark, a visible symbol of our proud and di verse heritage, a gift  to our children and  grandchildren, and a rallying point for the com munity as we look ahead to the future.  Mr. Speaker, the reopening of the Old State  House is an  important moment in the history  of Hartford and of Connecticut, and I am hon ored to submit these commemorative remarks  in order to share it with my colleagues.

Clara  moved with her  family  to Detroit when she  was  13,  and met  her husband,  Spencer  James Alston  there  in 1921. Clara married  Spencer in 1924, and they raised five children  in Detroit. They joined Hartford Avenue Baptist  Church, where Clara is still a member today.  Clara is the matriarch of a tremendous fam ily in southeast Michigan. She today has over  50 grand, great grand, and great-great grand  children.  Mr. Speaker, today we do not hear enough  news about the great things that are happen ing in families in America's big cities. We too  often hear the stories of broken homes and  failing  families. That  is why  I am asking that  we celebrate the 90th birthday of Clara Alston.  She  raised  five children  in Detroit. She has  lived a  long and productive  life as mother,  wife, grandmother, and as an artist and gar dener. She is the first person in her family to  reach 90 years of age, and she  is  the pride  and joy of her large family.  Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, May 4, Clara  Alston's family and friends are getting together  to celebrate her 90th birthday. I want to wish  Clara a wonderful and beautiful day  for her  special birthday.  TRIBUTE TO THE BRONX COMMU NITY COLLEGE HALL OF FAME  RUN  HON. JOSE E.

The  race brings  together runners of all  ages from the five boroughs of New York City  to compete in a wholesome community event.  The run was named after the Hall of Fame  for Great Americans, a national landmark es tablished  in 1900 to honor the achievements  of men and women  in science, the arts, hu manities,  business,  and  government.  This  beautiful  landmark,  designed  by  architect  Stanford White,  features a granite colonnade  of 97  distin containing  the  bronze  busts  guished Americans.  I have had the opportunity to participate in  15 of the 17 Bronx Community College Hall of  Fame Runs and I am thrilled to be running in  this year's race.

Gayle  Fitzgerald Cory worked in the Senate  for 35 years, serving in many capac ities. She was indispensable to the late  Senator Muskie for 22 years, holding  positions from receptionist  to execu tive assistant and making the transi tion to the State Department with him  in 1980. She was also a valued member  of Senator George Mitchell's staff as  his personal assistant.  A person who has filled these roles  can't help but accumulate a  tremen dous  amount  of  knowledge  on  the  workings of the Senate. Gayle Fitzger ald Cory was exceptionally qualified to  take on the position of postmaster in  1989.  Up until her retirement in 1995, Mrs.  Cory worked hard for the U.S. Senate,  she was experienced, organized and ca pable of handling any task or crisis  that came her way. Most of all, she was  a great person. The post office employ ees-indeed, everyone with whom she  came  in  contact-appreciated  her  warmth and her sense of fairness. An  extremely professional woman, she had  an almost uncanny understanding of  the special needs of the Senate, and she  was instrumental in making it work.  My condolences go out  to her hus band, Don, her three daughters, Laurie,  Melissa, and Carol, and all the mem bers of her large and loving family. She  was a courageous, strong person and we  will all miss her.  CONCLUSION OF MORNING  BUSINESS  ",1996
185,Senate,104,0.342,1395,7,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  wish to speak on the bill that is before  us-the bill  to  reimburse  the people  that were harmed in the unfair firing  at the White House in January 1993, the  bill that is for reimbursement to the  people that are called the Travelgate  17.  Mr. President, I think it is very obvi ous  that when politics stands in the  way of resolving a right or wrong issue,  politics always gets  trampled. Right  means that politics has to be put to the  side. Some examples come  to mind:  The civil rights laws of the 1960's; the  end of the defense buildup in the 1980's;  the Congressional Accountability Act  of 1995, which I sponsored.  This bill before us falls into that cat egory.  It  is  to  reimburse  the  Travelgate  7. Now,  obviously,  it  is  much less in scope  than all of these  other major pieces of legislation I men tioned over the last 30 years. However,  let me make it very clear that it is a  microcosm of the same reality. It is a  right and wrong issue. And politics is  standing in its way. But I predict that  politics will stand in its way only tem porarily. Travelgate is the story of an  arrogant White House  trampling all  over the rights of seven dedicated pub lic servants.  The purpose behind the abuse was so  that cronies of the President could win  the spoils of political gain for  them selves.  One of these people was a rich Holly wood producer, friend of Bill, high-dol lar campaign contributor, buddy and  crony by the name of Harry Thomason.  ",1996
186,Senate,104,0.536,1421,7,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President, I cer tainly want to commend the Senator  from Vermont for his outstanding re marks  regarding  the TEAM Act. He  talks about productivity  and  about  these fundamental communications.  I have here in my hand a document  which lists the illegal subjects of dis cussion as they have been decided in  different cases.  The Union Child Day-Care Center  case of 1991 said it was illegal to dis cuss allowing employees  to use com pany vehicles to obtain lunch. There fore, if there was some sort of discus sion that said, ""Well, if we could just  occasionally use one of the company  vehicles to go get the lunches, we could  * * *,""it would be illegal.  Here is another example. It says an  impermissible topic is, ""In-plant cafe teria and vending machine  food and  beverage prices."" So,  if a  discussion  group said,  ""You know, we need  to  lower prices on some of these things.  This concessionaire you have got run ning the vending machines around here  * * *,"" it would be illegal.  Here is a  third example: ""Company  provided meals""  is an  impermissible  topic.  If the  discussion  group  said,  ''You know, we could get some more  done if you guys could provide some  meals or help us with our eating* * *,""  it would be illegal.  ""Abolishing a paid lunch program""  was found to be  illegal, according to  the Van Dorn Machinery Co. case.

187,House,104,0.471,1447,7,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, I want to tell my colleagues about  one area of science that will be per formed aboard the space station.  Protein crystallography is a  field of  research that allows scientists to de termine the structure of proteins that  play critical roles in diseases.  To use  this  technique,  researchers  must grow large, high-quality crystals  of the protein. On Earth, gravity often  causes  the  crystals  to  grow  imper fectly, preventing scientists from de veloping new disease-fighting drugs.  Protein crystals grown in space, as  demonstrated on many space shuttle  flights, are superior in quality and size  to those grown on Earth. This means  that  researchers  can better develop  drugs to battle disease.  In fact, protein crystal grown on the  shuttle have already allowed research ers to develop drugs that are in FDA  trials even as we speak.  But the growth of many crystals re quires more than a few days available  aboard  the shuttle. That  is why we  need the space shuttle.  It will permit  researchers  to grow  their  crystals  in  a  nearly  perfect  microgravity environment for long pe riods of time.  Mr. Speaker,  researchers from uni versities  and  companies  around  the  world  strongly  support  the  inter national space station, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.  MAY 7, 1996, TAX FREEDOM DAY  (Mr.  HAYWORTH  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1996
188,House,104,0.162,1447,7,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, Moth er's Day is just a few short days away,  and I have a great idea for the congres sional  leadership and President Clin ton.  For all the mothers of America, let  us enact tough new child support en forcement reforms.  Last year this Congress voted to give  the States the tools and the teeth to  enforce child support orders when it  passed the welfare reform package. Un fortunately, the President vetoed that  bill,  and  the  child  support  reforms  along with it, and since that time child  support has been tangled in the larger  welfare reform debate.  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. No  more  excuses,  no more delays. The  children are suffering. Let us pass this  legislation now. No  one expects  the  welfare reform dispute to be settled for  months, if at all. Yet we all agree on a  bipartisan  basis  on  the  reforms  to  strengthen our child support system.  Child support evasion  is a national  disgrace. Each year millions of families  are denied billions of dollars to which  they are legally and morally entitled.  First the children are the victims and,  second, the taxpayers. Let us pass this  legislation.  GIVE THE TAXPAYERS A BREAK REPEAL THE CLINTON GAS TAX  (Mrs.  SEASTRAND asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1996
189,House,104,0.536,1447,7,Mrs. SEASTRAND.," Mr. Speaker, the  Clinton crunch is hitting the American  people hard. The most conspicuous evi dence of the Clinton crunch right now  is the soaring gas prices all over our  Nation. Back in 1993, President Clinton  enacted the largest tax increase in our  Nation's history. And included in this  tax package was a $4.8 billion tax in crease on gasoline. This Clinton gas  tax  is  hitting  all  consumers  right  where it hurts-in the wallet.  Mr. Speaker,  the American people  want to keep more of what they earn,  not continue to give more and more of  their hard-earned money to the Federal  Government.  I call on my Democrat  colleagues  to support a  repeal of the  Clinton gas tax. While $4.8 billion may  not seem like much money to some of  the Clinton Democrats, it's considered  a whole lot of money to the majority of  the American people.  Give  the  taxpayers a break. Repeal  the Clinton gas tax.  LET US BE FAIR  (Mr. FAZIO of California asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute.)  ",1996
190,House,104,-0.455,1447,7,Mr. FAZIO of California.," Mr. Speak er, we read in the Washington Post this  morning that Leader ARMEY is taking  the leading role in defining the remain der of this Congress' Republican revo lution. Apparently  the  revolution he  wants  to bring about  is  to cut edu cation so that we can go about reduc ing the gas tax without any promise,  any commitment that that will actu ally be passed through to consumers.  While  oil  companies are profiting,  and obviously many are based in his  home State of Texas, we seem to think  the only way we can help people who  are suffering from incredible increases  at the pump would be to cut programs  that will help their children.  This is the same leader who indicates  we ought not to have a minimum wage,  let alone an increase in it, that would  take it, in real dollars,  from 1950  to  1960.  It seems to me if we are going to ad dress the issue of cutting taxes on gas oline without passing them through to  consumers, we certainly ought  to be  willing to take up the issue of a mini mum wage for those people who strug gle each day to put food on the table  for their families. That would be a fair  way to lead this institution.  D 1430  SUPPORT ELIMINATION OF THE  GAS TAX .

195,House,104,-0.401,1486,7,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  Slaughter amendment. It is based on  the Protection From Sexual Predators  Act, which I have cosponsored.  I would like to note, in response to  the issues raised about germaneness or  correctness, not as a  technical matter  since the amendment is germane, that  this proposal is also about enhancing  sentences for those offenders whose be havior is not amenable to improvement  by any means that we have yet been  able to devise. As with pedophiles, we  have yet to find a method or program  that  in  the  case  of most  rapists  changes  their behavior so  that  they  will cease being a threat to other inno cent victims in the future. I think for  this reason the penalty proposed by the  author of the amendment is as appro priate as the punishment adopted pre viously by the Frost amendment.  I would note further that this bill is  about enhancing penalties in selected  cases for sound reasons. This amend ment is as sound as the Frost amend ment; it is as sound as the Chrysler  bill. It deserves support. For a Con gress that has allowed logging in the  Tongass National Forest as part of an  appropriations bill to now say that this  amendment  is not connected enough  with a bill to enhance sentences is, I  think, rather curious-very curious.  Mr. Chairman, I know that not every  Member has had  a  chance  to  read  through  the  jurisdictional basis  that  the gentlewoman from New York [Ms.  SLAUGHTER]  has  referred  to,  but  I  would urge Members to do so. I know  that there are genuine concerns that  can be expressed about  the  jurisdic tional issues and the scope and breadth  of Federal law, but I think that Mem bers who do have reservations, if they  will read through the amendment, will  be reassured that in fact this measure  is well  in keeping with  the Chrysler  bill and the Frost amendment.  I would urge that we step back, think  again,  and  approve  the  Slaughter  amendment.  ",1996
196,House,104,-0.526,1486,7,Mr. WA TT of North Carolina.," Mr.  Chairman, I move  to strike  the req uisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I think my colleagues  now  should begin  to understand ex actly why we  gave  jurisdiction  for  these decisions to the U.S. Sentencing  Commission. Once you get on this slip pery slope, once you start on the House  floor, we are going to have maybe 435  Members of Congress coming in saying,  hey, we ought to enhance penalties for  this offense, that offense, against this  vulnerable person, against this vulner able group, and there is no way to get  off of the merry-go-round.  Exactly the reason that we gave the  authority to the Sentencing Commission away from the politics and cam eras and give-and-take of having to run  in political contests, to go in and spend  the time that it takes to make reason able  judgments about sentencing pol icy, that is exactly the reason we gave  the Sentencing Commission  this  job.  And here, my colleagues, they do not  know how  to deal with  this because  this amendment, the truth of the mat ter, got offered by a Democrat. That is  the only difference it is.  It is politics now. As long as it is of fered by the other side, it is good pub lic policy. But let a Democrat come up  with the proposal, all of a sudden it is  politics. We do not know where to draw  the line, or it is unconstitutional, or  any irrational basis for making the de cision that we should have, should not  even be discussing in the first place.  We  ought  to  take  this whole bill,  with the Frost amendment, with the  Slaughter amendment, with the Chrys ler business that we started with and  send it over to the Sentencing Commis sion to do their job with it. They can  hold extensive hearings. They can so licit public comment. They can analyze  how this compares with other sentenc ing decisions. They can rationalize the  process. They can tell us, hey, some body ought not get a double sentence  just because they assaulted somebody  who is 65 years and in good heal th than  they would get for someone who is 64  years, 364 days, and in terrible health,  even lying in a bed in a hospital.  It makes no sense to do this. That is  exactly the reason, my colleagues, that  we gave this responsibility to the Sen tencing Commission.  that  is exactly  the reason I am going to give Members  an opportunity  to vote on giving  it  back to them, so that they can make  some  rational decisions, because  the  decisions we are making right now do  not make one iota of sense.

231,,104,-0.499,1551,7,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker,  sometimes I read an article so relevant to our  work, and so thoughtful and informative, that I  write a short gloss highlighting its main points  and have it printed here so our colleagues can  benefit from it.  Occasionally, I come across an article so in sightful and compelling that it would be pre sumptuous  to  summarize or paraphrase  it.  Nicholas Lemann's brilliant rebuttal of Senator  DOLE'S attack on Government funded housing  is such a piece.  I ask that  it be printed here so that Mem bers can read it before our debate and votes  on the Housing bill tomorrow.  [The article follows:]  THE PuBLIC HOUSING THAT SUCCEEDS  (By Nicholas Lemann)  PELHAM, NY.-One of the endearing things  about Senator Bob Dole  is  that he  is so  quintessentially the consensus-oriented leg islator  that his  forays  into  the  realm of  wedge issues always have a tinny, false feel ing, as if he isn't emotionally connected to  the words coming out of his own mouth. His  statement last week that American public  housing ""is one of the last bastions of social ism in the world""  is a good example. It's  hard to believe that Mr. Dole was candidly  revealing his most deeply held views.  Still,  the  idea  that public housing has  failed and should be abolished is something  many Americans believe. High-rise public  housing projects  such as  the notoriously  dangerous and bleak Robert Taylor Homes in  Chicago are the leading visual symbol of the  idea that liberal Government programs, es pecially antipoverty programs, don't work  and may actually cause poverty to increase.  If public housing were in fact a bankrupt  and doomed idea, it would be a very sad end  to the oldest and most visible strategy in the  struggle against poverty. Jacob Riis' ""How  the Other Half Lives,"" published in 1890 and  arguably the first American book to propose  a  plan  for  improving conditions  in urban  slums, ended with a call for the construction  of ""model tenements."" If Mr. Dole is right,  the whole antipoverty cause would be power fully undermined.  The truth, however, is that housing for the  poor stands out among antipoverty strate gies as the area where the most progress has  been made over  the past generation  and  where there is the most cause for optimism.  Senator Dole's comments were so completely  wrong that they could help bring a halt to  genuine progress rather than pull  the plug  on something unworkable.  Before the World War II, public housing in  America was considered a great success. It  ""worked"" in the sense of being clean, safe  and, for most residents, a huge improvement  over the slums where they had been living.  There were  long waiting  lists  for  apart ments.  One reason for the projects' good reputa tion was that their constituency was not the  very poor but people with  jobs one notch  higher on the economic ladder. (Probably the  most famous product of the public housing of  that era  is Elvis Presley.) Most projects  wouldn't admit single parents, and many  10403  wouldn't admit welfare recipients. Virtually  all maintained strict rules about keeping  apartments and hallways neat and about who  was allowed to be where when. Those who  broke the rules or committed crimes were  swiftly kicked out.  Then  in  the  late 1940's,  the nation em barked on the course that led to the percep tion that public housing doesn't work:  the  construction of enormous high-rise projects.  It wasn't  just the architecture, or the mere  presence  of Government  subsidies,  that  caused these places to go so horribly awry.  There was also a big change in the tenant  population, from carefully screened working  people to the very poor. Because of changes  in Federal rules, people who got jobs actu ally had to leave the building, and it became  nearly impossible to kick out tenants who  were criminals.  Even so, it's not all public housing that  doesn't work. It's  just the large-scale, all poor, severely isolated projects that invari ably fail. Just a few blocks from the Robert  Taylor Homes are pleasant high-rise projects  for senior citizens.  ""Imagine,  the United States Government  owns  the housing where an entire class of  citizens permanently lives,"" Mr. Dole said,  as if this were fantastically improbable. Yet  in most industrial countries a much larger  portion of the population lives in Govern ment housing. Three percent of Americans  live in public housing, as opposed to more  than a fifth of the population in Great Brit ain, Germany, France and the Netherlands.  What's unusual about American public hous ing is that it serves primarily the very poor.  It is paradoxical that Mr. Dole chose to  stage his attack on public housing at a real tors' convention, because the real estate in dustry, by and large, supported the construc tion of the worst projects. In the 1950's and  60's; African-American migrants  from  the  South were streaming into the big cities, and  part of reason for the building of the projects  was  to contain  them within  the existing  ghettos so as to avoid residential integra tion.  In any case, the mistake of the high-rise,  all-poor projects was fairly quickly realized;  in 1968, Congress banned the construction of  any more them. These projects have no de fenders  except  for  unaccountably  loyal  groups of residents. To set high-rise projects  up as being the fruits of a real political posi tion, as some critics of public housing have,  is to create a straw man.  Under Secretary Henry Cisneros,  the De partment of Housing and Urban Development  has begun demolishing about 30,000 of the  worst high-rises. The agency is also trying to  reinstate policies of giving preferences  to  people with  jobs and swiftly kicking out  criminals.  In his speech to the realtors, Senator Dole  called for  replacing public housing with a  voucher  system. But we  already  have  a  voucher system, called Section 8, which is  perpetually underfinanced  (partly because  the real estate industry is so effective in lob bying against its expansion) and  thus has  very long waiting lists. Mr. Dole has repeat edly voted against increasing financing for  the program, and he failed  to support Mr.  Cisneros's proposal last year for a major new  housing voucher program.  There is an alternative to old-style public  housing.  In  the decades  since we  stopped  building new projects, hundreds of thousands  of units for the poor have been created by  local community development corporations,  private groups that have sprung up around  the country since the 70's. On the whole, this  ",1996
232,House,104,-0.402,12,13,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, Ameri cans realize that the welfare system is  working neither for the  taxpayer nor  for those it is designed to help. But the  question is not whether to change the  system but how to change it.  The question is, will we provide the  means to escape welfare or will we simply be plain mean to poor people? Like  most every other problem  that  this  Gingrich Congress has faced,  the best  way to solve the problem is with a bi partisan approach.  I have not  found  any party or, for that matter, any indi vidual who has got a perfect answer to  this challenge.  Unfortunately,  like  strengthening  Medicare, like trying to get a balanced  budget, like trying to avert these cost ly Gingrich Government  shutdowns,  when some of us have said, let us work  together and find a common moderate  approach,  others have  replied,  it  is  NEWT'S way or no way.  That is where we are this morning.  Do we pursue a  bipartisan approach  such as  that advanced by Governor  CASTLE  and by  the gentleman  from  Tennessee, Mr. TANNER,  and  try  to  place  the emphasis not on  targeting  poor kids but targeting what is wrong  in this system, or do we  take an ex treme approach that is more designed  to address the political welfare needs  of  those who have  failed again and  again in this Congress rather than re pairing the real welfare reform system?  I believe we have got an approach  that will work, imperfectly, to get us  out of the welfare problems we have  today. Let us get about adopting it in  a bipartisan way.  ",1996
233,House,104,-0.428,12,13,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, we  have reached a point where there is a  national consensus  that  is emerging  that our No. 1 priority in social welfare  is to protect poor children. There is a  consensus that welfare, in fact, tracts  children in poverty, and the key is to  allow families to work to escape.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Re publican bill hinders that progress that  is so critical and undercuts  that na tional consensus.  I come from a State, Oregon, that is  actually moving people off welfare into  gainful employment. The bill that we  have looming before us is going to un dercut the progress of my State.  First of all, by having inflexible work  participation  requirements,  you will  actually penalize the successful State  as it ratchets down into the next cen tury. By having all child support in a  centralized bureaucratic system, which  my State tried in the 1970's, found to  be unnecessary, found to be expensive  and found that we had better ways, we  will be forced back into that unneces sary  bureaucracy,  unnecessary  ex pense.  By having a 5-year arbitrary limit on  child care, we deal with the ironic situ ation of having some successful fami lies who are fighting  to remain em ployed to be forced back into poverty.  This is lunacy.  I appreciate at least having the Tan ner-Castle amendment being put before  us as an alternative. We need to keep  ",1996

235,House,104,0.384,25,13,Ms. DUNN of Washington.," Madam  Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for  yielding time to me.  Madam Chairman, Democrats have  been arguing  today  that noncitizens  are less likely to receive welfare than  citizens, but the leading scholar in this  area, whose name is George Borjas of  the Kennedy School, says just the op posi te.  We have a chart here that I would  like Members to look at. These num bers are percentages of households re ceiving welfare programs. The first line  says ""Aid to Families with Dependent  Children,"" our AFDC program. 4.4 per cent of immigrant households receive  this kind of aid, as opposed to 2.9 per cent of folks who are citizens of the  United States, and the chart continues.  In short, Madam Chairman,  I  just  want  to say that  there  is simply no  question that some Members are today  on this floor spreading misinformation.  Welfare for noncitizens has gotten out  of  hand. We  have  an  opportunity  through  this  legislation  to  change  that.  ",1996

237,House,104,0.314,129,13,Mr. KASICH.," Madam Chairman,  let  me make clear what  the amendment  does so that there is no confusion. If  you are able-bodied,  single, between  the ages of 18 and 50 and you get food  stamps, we  are  saying you have  to  work 20 hours a week. It is no more  complicated than that. If you cannot  get a  job, you go  in a workfare pro gram;  45  out of 50  States have  a  workfare program.  Let me just suggest to the Members,  if there is any program that Americans  who go to work are frustrated about, it  is food stamps. They get frustrated to  stand in line at the grocery store and  just observe what goes on and the way  in which people buy. They think people  are trading them, they think there is a  lot of fraud  involved in the program.  The American people, while supporting  a food stamp program, they want the  food stamp program cleaned up, tight ened up, and fixed and reformed.  Madam Chairman, what this amend ment says is that if you need to get  food stamps and you are single, you are  able-bodied, you are between the ages  of 18 and 50, you have to do some work  in exchange for the food stamps.  The opposition  to  this amendment,  frankly,  is opposed to the very prem ises that underlie our bill, our welfare  bill. Our welfare bill says at some point  you have to get trained, you have to go  to work. You have to get off the sys tem and get a job.  What  this amendment says  is very  simple. If your people at home are frustrated about food stamps, this amend ment does not take away food stamps.  It says, though, if you are going to get  food stamps, you are going to work 20  hours a week; 20 hours a week.  If you cannot find a  job, you go to  work for the State in a workfare pro gram, and maybe you whitewash the  graffiti, or maybe you clean up  the  neighborhood, but you participate in a  program where you do some work in  exchange,  in  exchange  for  the  food  stamps that you get.  Madam Chairman,  it  is not  com plicated. There is not a reason that I  can think of as to why you should not  be able to put in 20 hours a week if you  are able-bodied, between the age of 18  to 50, in exchange for that program.  I would say to the House, think about  this. If my colleagues support the un derlying parts of this bill that call for  people to work, that call for people to  get trained, then clearly they support  this concept. We are not asking people  to work overly generous hours. In fact,  there  is already a  requirement  that  says you have to work 8 months out of  the year. What we say is we will give  you a  little exemption up front for 3  months, you have your 3 months, but  after that if you need the food stamps  you have to put in a little bit of work.  I think that is fair for the people who  get the food stamps, and I think it is  eminently reasonable and fair for the  people that pay the bills for those who  get the food stamps.  Support the Ney amendment.  ",1996

241,Senate,104,-0.395,298,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  the Na tion's current welfare system does not  serve the Nation well. It has failed the  children it is intended to protect and it  has failed the American taxpayer. I am  hopeful that the debate in the Senate  will ultimately result in a constructive  bipartisan effort which will finally end  the current system and achieve mean ingful reform.  Meaningful reform will assure  that  children are protected, that able-bod ied people work and that child support  enforcement laws are effective in get ting absent parents  to support  their  children.  One challenge is to seek genuine re form  of welfare without abandoning  the  goal  of  helping  children.  The  Daschle work-first bill fundamentally  changes the current welfare system by  replacing unconditional, unlimited aid  with conditional benefits for a limited  time.  Under the work-first bill, in order to  receive assistance, all recipients must  sign a contract. This contract will con tain an  individual plan designed  to  move  the parent promptly  into  the  work force. Those who refuse to sign a  contract won't get  assistance  and  tough  sanctions apply  to  those not  complying with the contract they sign.  The underlying  legislation  requires  people to work within no more than 2  years. Why wait that long? Why wait 2  years? Unless someone is in school or  job training, why wait longer than 3  months to require that a person who is  able bodied either have a private job or  be performing community service.  I have  long believed  that work  re quirements should be applied prompt ly. The Daschle amendment contains  language which  I will  offer  as  an  amendment  to  the underlying bill,  if  the Daschle substitute fails which re quires that recipients be in training or  in school or working in a private sector  job within 3 months, or if one cannot  be  found,  in community service em ployment. Within  3 months,  not  2  years.  The  requirement  would  be  phased in to allow States the chance to  adjust  administratively  and  would  allow for a State to opt out.  Last year, the Senate-passed welfare  reform bill contained  this provision,  added as an amendment which I offered  with Senator Dole.  Experience has  shown we must be  more aggressive in requiring recipients  to work. But, as we require recipients  to work, we must remember another  important part of the challenge facing  us: that fully two-thirds of welfare re cipients nationwide are children. Al most 10 million American children nearly 400,000  in Michigan alone-re ceive benefits. We must not punish the  kids.  I am hopeful that the 104th Congress  is on the road to finding a way to get  people off welfare and into jobs, in the  private sector, if possible, but in com munity service, if necessary; make sure  that absent parents take  the respon sibility for  the support of their chil dren; and do  these things without pe nalizing children-that way, I believe,  is the work first plan offered by Sen ator DASCHLE.  I  congratulate  Senator  DASCHLE,  Senator MIKULSKI,  Senator BREAUX,  and the many others of my colleagues  who have worked on the Daschle work  first bill.  The work first bill is tough on get ting people into jobs, but it provides  the necessary incentives and resources  to the States not only to require people  to work, but to help people find  jobs,  and keep them.  Mr. President, I have focused on get ting to people to work. However, there  are other elements of positive welfare  reform that I support. The number of  children born to unwed teenage parents  has continued to rise at unacceptable  rates. We all recognize the need to do  something about  this and  to  remove  any incentives created by the welfare  system for teenagers to have children.  I  support  teen pregnancy prevention  programs with considerable flexibility  for the States in implementation.  We know, however, that the problem  of teen pregnancy and unwed teenage  parents will not be completely or eas ily eliminated. I strongly support pro visions which require  teen parents to  continue their education or job train ing and to live either at home, with an  adult family member, or in an adult supervised  group home  in  order  to  qualify for benefits.  Another key element of any success ful welfare reform plan will be assuring  that parents  take  responsibility  for  their children. We must toughen and  improve  interstate  enforcement  of  child support. I support provisions to  require cooperation in establishing the  paternity of a child as a condition of  eligibility for benefits, and a range of  measures such as driver's license and  passport restrictions, use of Federal in come  tax  refunds,  and ah enhanced  data base capability for locating par ents who do not meet their child sup port obligations.  The Daschle amendment which is be fore us addresses these and other prob lems. It ends the failed welfare system  and replaces it with a program to move  people  into  jobs,  to guarantee child  care assistance, to assure that parents  take  responsibility  for  the  children  they bring into the world, and does so  without penalizing the children.

246,,104,0.536,337,13,Mr. ASHCROFT.," Mr. President,  in  1994, one out of every four 2-year-olds  had not received  the proper vaccina tions. This  statistic worsens  appre ciably in urban areas. For example, a  1995 survey of State health department  clinics in Houston found that only 14  percent of the children were up-to-date  on their immunizations.  Because these children are not being  immunized,  the Centers  for Disease  Control reported 1,537 needless and eas ily avoidable incidences of mumps in  1994.  Such a deplorable lack of basic pre ventive health care is inexcusable, par ticularly since immunizations are free  in America.  The Vaccines for Children Program  administered by the National Immuni zation Program of the Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention provides  free vaccines to children under 18 who  are eligible for Medicaid, or are unin sured or underinsured.  When a child in America is not im munized, it is entirely the fault of the  parent. It is a blatantly irresponsible  act not to immunize a child.  We should not be paying welfare re cipients to abdicate their responsibil ity. The welfare system should encour age people to take care of their own.  Children are the future, and in order  to break the cycle of dependence, chil dren of welfare recipients need every  break available.  All  schools  require  immunization  records for a child to be enrolled. An  unimmunized child can be denied ad mission  to  school. And a  child  that  doesn't go to school will probably end  up on welfare.  What's wrong with requiring parents  on welfare to have their children im munized? We shouldn't be paying par ents to neglect their children.  This  amendment  allows States  to  sanction welfare recipients of TANF,  and other States programs who do not  immunize their children.  This amendment also requires States  to sanction Food Stamps and SSI re cipients who do not  immunize  their  children.  Again,  immunizations  are  free  to  Medicaid recipients and the uninsured  in hospitals and clinics across the Na tion, so there is simply no legitimate  excuse for parents not  to have  their  children  immunized.  Additionally,  States  think  immunization  require ments for government aid are a good  idea.  According  to  the American Public  Welfare Association 12 States have re ceived Federal waivers  to  implement  AFDC requirements for immunization.  For example: Delaware,  immuniza tion is required for pre-school children.  Failure  to comply results  in $50 de crease per month in AFDC grant. Indi ana, recipients must show proof within  12 months of AFDC application  that  children are  immunized. Families  in  noncompliance are sanctioned $90 per  month. Michigan sanctions AFDC fam ilies $25 per month if parents fail to im munize pre-school-age children accord ing  to State policy. Mississippi chil dren under 6 must receive regular im munization and checkups or sanction  of $25 per month applies. AFDC pre schoolers in Texas must be immunized  or the State may sanction the family  $25 per child. And finally, in Virginia,  AFDC  recipients with  children who  have not been immunized receive fiscal  sanctions of $50 for the first child and  $25 for each additional child.  This amendment is the best means to  ensure that all children everywhere are  immunized against deadly, but easily  controllable diseases such as mumps,  tetanus, measles, polio, et cetera.  It is a  first step to encouraging re sponsibility  in a  system  that breeds  decadence and dependence-a step up ward on the ladder of opportunity out  of our current welfare system's net of  ensnarement.

247,,104,-0.374,506,13,Mr. LEAHY.," I rise in strong support  of Senator MURRAY'S language in the  legislative  appropriations  bill.  This  language would require the Senate to  streamline the transfer of excess and  surplus computer equipment to our Na tion's classrooms. It would require the  Senate  to follow  the same guidelines  that the Federal agencies must follow  in accordance with the President's Fed eral Exe cu ti ve Order.  President Clinton has set forth an  ambitious goal to bring computers to  every  school  in America.  Congress  should lead the way. Thanks to Sen ator MURRAY'S efforts, the Senate will  be participating in this initiative.  Recently, I wrote several letters to  the Sergeant at Arms to find out what  our official Senate policy is concerning  disposal  of  excess  surplus  computer  equipment. I was surprised to hear that  the Senate does not have an official  policy. In the past the Senate has sold  excess computer equipment or  trans ferred it over  to GSA for  later sale.  Since 1993, the Senate disposed of 4,400  pieces of computer equipment. Of that  total 2,600 have been sold, 1,400 have  been transferred to GSA, and 400 have  been retained for parts. These compu t ers would have been a wonderful  re source to our Nation's schools.  I encourage my colleagues to join our  efforts in creating a partnership with  our nation's schools and bring comput ers to every classroom in America so  that all students may have the benefits  of our new educational technology.

Section 403 of the Congres sional Budget and Impoundment Act  requires that a statement of the cost of  a  reported bill be  included in the re port. When the Committee on Environ ment and Public Works filed the report  to S. 1730 on June 26, 1996, we included  only a portion of the estimated impact  of the bill. CBO had not completed the  estimated impact at the time of filing.  I am pleased to report that the cost  statements to be  included  in  today's  RECORD complete the CBO estimate for  s. 1730.  The estimates follow:  U.S. CONGRESS,  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,  Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.  Hon. JOHN H. CHAFEE,  Chairman, Committee on Environment and Pub lic Works, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR.  CHAIRMAN: The Congressional  Budget Office  has prepared  the  enclosed  mandate cost statements for S. 1730, the Oil  Spill Prevention and Response Improvement  Act, as reported by the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works on June 26,  1996. CBO transmitted its estimate of the im pact of S. 1730 on the federal budget on June  26, 1996.  Enactment of S. 1730 would  impose both  intergovernmental and private-sector man dates as defined by the Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4). The  costs of the mandates would not exceed the  respective $50 million and $100 million an nual thresholds.  If you wish further details on these esti mates, we will be pleased to provide them.  Sincerely,  JAMES L. BLUM  (For June E. O'Neill).  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE  ESTIMATED  COST OF  INTERGOVERNMENTAL MANDATES,  JULY 17, 1996  1. Bill number: S. 1730.  2. Bill title: The Oil Spill Prevention and  Response Improvement Act.  3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate  Committee  on  Environment  and  Public  Works on June 26, 1996.  4. Bill purpose: The bill would amend fed eral law dealing with oil pollution by: impos ing new operational, structural, and safety  requirements on tanker and towing vessels;  allowing more funds to be spent out of the  emergency  fund of the Oil Spill Liability  Trust Fund; and limiting the liability of cer tain tanker vessels that have double hulls  and are responsible for oil spills.  5.  Intergovernmental mandates contained  in bill:  Vessel Requirements. The bill would  re quire the Secretary of Transportation to incorporate additional measures in three sets  of rules being proposed by the Coast Guard.  The rules deal with navigational equipment  for towing vessels and operational and struc tural requirements for  tanker vessels  that  have a single hull and weigh more than 5,000  gross tons. These requirements are intergov ernmental mandates because a small frac tion of these vessels, less than 2 percent, are  owned by state,  local, and  tribal govern ments.  Under-Keel Clearance. S.1730 would pre empt the authority of captains of ports to es tablish minimum under-keel clearances  in  their ports by requiring  the Secretary of  Transportation to establish minimum under keel clearances for each port. This preemp tion constitutes an intergovernmental man date because ports are owned by state and  local  governments  or  their  subsidiaries.  However, this preemption might occur under  current law. The Coast Guard is about 'to  issue a  final rule regarding structural and  operational measures for tanker vessels that  have a single hull and weigh more than 5,000  gross tons. The Coast Guard's proposed rule  would prohibit vessels with an under-keel  clearance of less than 0.5 meters from enter ing or exiting a port without the approval of  the captain of the port.  6. Estimated direct costs of mandates to  State, local, and tribal governments:  (a) Is the $50 Million Threshold Exceeded?  No.  (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates: The  new requirements on tanker and towing ves sels owned by state, local, or tribal govern ments would have a negligible effect on their  budgets. Preempting the authority of port  captains to establish a minimum under-keel  clearance for their ports would have no di rect impact on the budgets of ports.  (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Author ity: Not applicable.  7. Basis of estimate:  Vessel Requirements. S. 1730 would modify  three rulemakings that the Coast Guard is  currently carrying out. If the final rules are  not in place by the dates specified in the bill  (all of which are in the next six months), S.  1730 would require that the proposed rules be  in effect until  the  final  rules are put  in  place.  Based  on  information  provided by  the  Coast Guard, CBO expects that all the final  rules will be in place by the deadlines speci fied in the bill or by October 1, 1996, the as sumed enactment date of the bill. Enactment  of S. 1730 should therefore not result in the  rules being imposed earlier than they would  otherwise be  imposed under current law. If  the Coast Guard does not meet the deadlines,  however,  the shipping industry would  face  about $15 million per month in additional  costs because it would have to comply with  the proposed rules at an earlier date  than  would  occur  under  current  law. Vessels  owned by state,  local, and  tribal govern ments would bear a small fraction of these  costs.  The  bill would  also  require  the Coast  Guard to add additional requirements to its  final rules, such as fire suppression equip ment on towing vessels and safety measures  for single-hull barges. CBO estimates  that  the up-front costs for the shipping industry  as a whole would be no more than $18 million  and annual operational costs would be mini mal. Because less than 2 percent of these ves sels are owned by state, local, and tribal gov ernments,  the  cost of  these  intergovern mental mandates would be negligible.  Under-Keel Clearance.

251,,104,-0.267,636,13,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I want  to make one additional comment, not  on this amendment, but on the one of fered by Senator CONRAD. That amend ment is the issue of the optional food  stamp block grant.  My understanding of the amendment  is that the block grant option that ex ists in the bill is a problem, and the  amendment would  repeal  the  block  grant. The amendment's supporters be lieve-and I firmly believe-that if we  decide that it is a function of national  will, a national objective to decide that  those who do not have enough to eat,  then we are going to try to help get  them some food.  If that is a national issue, it is not an  issue between one county and another  county,  or  one  State  and  another  State, or one city and another city. It  is an issue of national determination  that we do not want people  in  this  country to be hungry. We do not want  kids to go without meals. We want to  develop  a  national  standard  that  makes sure this country, as good and  generous and as strong as this country  is, can feed those people among us who  have  suffered  some difficulties, who  were unfortunate enough  to be born  into  circumstances  of poverty, who  have had  some other disadvantages,  and who find themselves down and out,  down on their luck, and also hungry.  We know what to do about hunger.  This is not some mysterious disease for  which there is no cure. We know what  causes hunger and how to resolve it.  Part of this bill deals with the issues  of resolving hunger and helping people  get prepared  for  the workplace. An other part says you cannot prepare 8year-olds for a  job. We ought not to  prepare 10-year-olds for a  job. If we  have  kids  living  in  poverty,  or  grownups living in poverty, we want to  make sure that we have a system to  say that we will help them get back on  their feet. While we are helping them  get back on their feet, we do not want  them to be hungry-kids, adults, any body in this country. That is why we  have had a Food Stamp Program. Is it  perfect? No. Has it worked well? Sure.  We ought not, in any way, decide that  we should retreat from  that. That is  why I so strongly support the amend ment offered by Senator CONRAD and  Senator JEFFORDS.

This is a search for information, this  commission, not legislative nor regu latory functions, but a search for infor mation that has a uniquely national  characteristic. The States,  important  as  they are, are really not competent  to do a national search that involves  the issue of gambling. So, it may be an  intrusion, but it is really not an either/  or proposition: States'  rights versus  national intrusion. This subject lends  itself to national study. So that is all  that this is going to encompass.  Some  things are best done by  the  States. Some  things are best done by  the Federal Government, and it is pret ty hard to have a hard and fast rule.  Generally, we Republicans prefer local  government over national government,  but  that, again, depends on  the cir cumstance.  Tort reform, for example, in my judg ment, and although I do not speak for  all my colleagues on  the Republican  side, lent itself to a national solution  rather than a State solution.

254,House,104,-0.458,740,13,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 3844. Let me say this year that the  gentleman  from  New  York  WALSH],  the chairman of the commit tee, should be congratulated for reach ing out in a bipartisan way in an effort  to keep extraneous material and legis lative issues off of the District of Co lumbia appropriation bill.  Let me also commend the chairman  of the committee, along with the fine  staff that he has, Migo Miconi, John  Simmons, Mike Fischetti, and Mary  Porter, and take a special time to say  that in the minority we do not have  the large staff that the majority has.  Cheryl Smith, who  is an assistant to  me, a staff assistant to me on the Sub committee on the District of Columbia,  operates on  three other committees  and in fact does an excellent job. I ap preciate the time and the effort that  she gives me.  I  think, Mr. Chairman,  that  this  marks a significant turn in the D.C. ap propriations bill but also the finances  of the District. I would have to point  out that the District, under the super vision of  the Control Board,  is now  making arrangements to borrow short  term from Wall Street, which I think is  an encouraging sign that Wall Street  thinks  that  they are moving  in  the  right direction.  This bill comes to us without con troversy for the first time. The District  of Columbia,  the  city  council,  the  Mayor, the Control Board, and we here  in Congress, at least our subcommit tee,  agrees  as  to what  the  figures  should be, and there is no controversy  surrounding that.  I would like to take time to point out  two or three issues. The first one is the  unfunded liability of the pension plan.  As the chairman of the committee in dicated, we are providing $52 million.  The President had sent up $102 million  to try to relieve the unfunded liability  that  the District has  in  its pension  plan.  I do not excuse  the fact  that,  since  the District took over the pen sion plan,  they have continued  the  twice-a-year COLA's. As the chairman  pointed out,  they have been slow  to  move on the issue of reforming their  pension plan.  I must point out that at the time the  District  took over  the pension plan,  there was  a  $2.7 billion deficit. We  move $2. 7 billion of liability from the  Federal Government  to  the District  Government. Also,  I must point out  that  it has about doubled. But  the  point that I would like to make is, no,  it  is  true  that  the District cannot  spend its way out of this financial cri sis nor can it entirely cut its way out  of this financial crisis.  This body must recognize  that we  have  responsibilities, particularly  to  that pension plan to come up with a re vised program to make it financially  ",1996

257,Senate,104,0.356,805,13,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President,  I  am going to ask our Members to come  together and do what is right for Amer ica and welfare reform. Right now we  have a  fair  funding  formula. A non growth State never loses from its 1994  base or its 1995 base, whichever base it  chooses. The growth States are able to  grow because that is essential, and we  know it is fair. There are no losers in  the  underlying  bill.  The  Graham Bumpers amendment creates winners  and losers. It says to California, Michi gan, Minnesota, and New York, ""You  are going to have to go below and actu ally cut  the welfare  in your State  below  the 1994 and 1995  limits."" Mr.  President, that is wrong. We came to gether and we made a very, very fair  proposal, and it was accepted because  there are no losers.  Now, Mr. President, we must keep  that fairness. If we really want welfare  reform, we must have fairness for all  States. That  is what  the underlying  bill is.  the Graham Please  vote  against  Bumpers amendment.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Per sonal  Responsibility, Work  Oppor tunity,  and Medicaid Restructuring   Act of 1996 (S. 1956) replaces the cur rent AFDC Program with a new tem porary assistance  for needy  families  [TANF] block grant. The TANF block  grant will distribute Federal funds to  the States  according  to  a  formula  which is based on recent Federal ex penditures under the programs which  are to be consolidated into the T ANF,  with supplemental funds based on pop ulation growth and  low Federal ex penditures  per  poor  person  in  the  States. By emphasizing historical fund ing for welfare benefits,  this formula  recognizes that the cost of living dif fers from State to State, and that cer tain States have historically supported  generous welfare benefits through the  expenditure of their own funds.  My colleagues, Senators GRAHAM and  BUMPERS, have offered an amendment  to S. 1956 which would significantly  change the formula for the T ANF block  grants. Because  the Graham-Bumpers  formula would dramatically decrease  TANF allotments in certain States and  would arbitrarily and unfairly  force  the elimination or reduction of exist ing welfare benefits,  I am unable  to  support  this  amendment. This  vote  does,  however,  raise  the  important  issue of the disparities in TANF block  grant allotments which  the  formula  will create. While I recognize that dif ferences in the cost of living and other  factors necessitate some disparity  in  allotments, I encourage the conference  committee  to explore appropriate al ternatives which address these dispari ties,  further  assisting States which  have low Federal expenditures per poor  person under the formula and which ex perience population growth.

259,Senate,104,0.375,818,13,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President,  in 1962,  President Kennedy, in his budget mes sage to Congress, noted:  The goals of our public welfare program  must be positive and constructive. It must  contribute to the attack on dependency, ju venile delinquency, family breakdown, ille gitimacy, ill health, and disability. It must  replace the incidence of these problems, pre vent their occurrence and recurrence, and  strengthen and protect the vulnerable in a  highly competitive world.  This statement presents the strong,  initial common ground that we share:  that Government has a legitimate role  in supporting our most helpless and  desperate families with dependent chil dren.  Certainly,  our  second  ground  of  agreement is that an appropriate wel fare policy should do nothing to harm  the family being supported. Families  are the foundation of our Nation's val ues. They teach us the principles of ec onomics,  the value of  relationships,  and  the  importance of moral  truths.  They define our view of work, respon sibility, and authority. They teach us  the meaning of trust, the value of hon esty, and are the wellspring of every  individual's  strength  against  alien ation, failure, and despair.  During countless eras when no other  organized unit of society even  func tioned, the family was the institution  that made survival of the cultural, po litical, economic, and social order pos sible.  We should agree on what a welfare  policy should protect-the family-and  what  it  should protect against-de pendence on the State. We should also  agree that this Nation's current wel fare policy has diverged greatly from  President Kennedy's vision.  The Government has attempted  to  end  poverty  by  establishing  an  engorged  bureaucracy  and  writing  checks, all told pouring over $5 trillion  into the war on poverty. At the same  time,  individual  dependence  on  the  Government has increased,  individual  dignity has declined, and  the family  has been dealt a near fatal blow.  Today, there are more people living  in poverty  than ever before-and the  only  thing  the Government welfare  state has succeeded at doing is spawn ing generations of people who will be  born, live, and die without ever having  held a steady job, owned a home, or  known  the strength of a  two parent  family.  Individual dependence on  the State  has increased with every Government  intervention. Indeed, the population re ceiving  welfare  payments  receives  checks for extraordinarily long periods  of time. Under current law, 25 percent  of women can expect to receive those  payments for more than 8 years. The  typical recipient receives payments for  almost 4 years. Forty percent of recipi ents return to the welfare rolls at least  once.  Government  intervention  has  dis torted the economic incentive system  that, at least in part, motivates a per son to give of his labor. Government  intervention eliminates  the need  to  work to support oneself and one's fam ily by providing money regardless of  whether  one works. Dependence  on  such a system is all but inevitable.  Given time, a cash payment that is  not tied to a requirement to work will  undermine  the  second motivation  to  work; namely,  the desire  to produce  some benefit, whether tangible or in tangible, for oneself or for society. Who  can doubt that a person experiencing  such  a  disconnection  for  any  pro tracted period of time will eventually  suffer a  loss of individual dignity as  the welfare  system undermines  the  moral and personal  responsibility of  the recipient?  Today however, we are turning to the  issue of solutions. Whatever the pro posed solution, we must gauge its effec tiveness and desirability  in  terms of  the  three common grounds discussed  throughout this debate. Does our pol icy foster dependence on the Govern ment or promote independent action by  the  individual? Does  it promote  the  dignity of the human person or under mine it? Does it destroy the family or  build it up?  I am convinced  that we will only  achieve successful welfare reform when  we begin to emphasize personal respon sibility. Unfortunately, for far too long  welfare  programs  supported  by  the  Federal Government have failed to ac knowledge and promote personal  re sponsibility,  and many  other  core  American values.  I would argue that the key goal of  welfare  reform must be  to promote  self-sufficiency. A beginning step  to ward self-sufficiency is to change peo ple's expectations about welfare. A re cent GAO study noted that a key chal lenge  for States  is  to  learn how  to  break the entitlement mentality-the  view that public assistance is a guaran teed benefit. States had to start help ing individuals understand that a  job  was in their best interests.  One successful approach to encourage  greater responsibility which  is being  experimented with by several States is  the  use  of  personal  responsibility  agreements. I am proud to say that In diana has been at the forefront of help ing  individuals  and  families  achieve  long-term stability and self-sufficiency  through the use of personal responsibil ity agreements. With personal respon sibility agreements, Indiana's welfare  reform plan moves families away from  dependence  and  toward work. More  than 39,000 individuals and families in  Indiana have signed personal  respon sibility agreements as of April 1996.  Indiana's agreements  require  that  families who receive AFDC understand  that welfare is temporary assistance,  and not a way of life. They must de velop a self-sufficiency plan and go to  work as quickly as possible, recogniz ing sanctions will be imposed for quit ting a  job, refusing to accept a  job or  dropping out of the job program. Fami lies must also take responsibility for  their children's timely immunizations  and  regular  school attendance. Fur thermore, their AFDC benefits will be  limited to  the number of children in  the family within the first 10 months of  ",1996

They have filed a pro test letter to the U.S. Department of  Agriculture, but  the  issue  over  the  years has been worked out with the co op with the U.S. Department of Agri culture in such a manner as to be with in the purview of the ethics rules and  regulations.

263,House,104,0.043,909,13,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  suspend  the  rules and pass  the bill  (H.R. 3564) to amend the NATO Partici pation Act of 1994 to expedite the tran sition to full membership in the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization of emerg ing democracies in Central and Eastern  Europe, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 3564  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""NATO En largement Facilitation Act of1996"".  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  The Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Since 1949,  the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) has played an essential  role in guaranteeing the security, freedom,  and prosperity of the United States and its  partners in the Alliance.  (2) The NATO Alliance  is, and has been  since its inception, purely defensive in char acter, and it poses no threat to any nation.  The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to in clude as full and equal members emerging  democracies in Central and Eastern Europe  will serve to reinforce stability and security  in Europe by fostering their integration into  the structures which have created and sus tained peace in Europe since 1945. Their ad mission to NATO will not threaten any na tion. America's security, freedom, and pros perity remain linked to the security of the  countries of Europe.  (3) The sustained commitment of the mem ber countries of NATO to a mutual defense  has made possible  the democratic  trans formation of Central and Eastern Europe.  Members of the Alliance can and should play  a  critical  role  in addressing  the  security  challenges of the post-Cold War era and in  creating the stable environment needed for  those emerging democracies in Central and  Eastern Europe to successfully complete po litical and economic transformation.  (4) The United States continues to regard  the political independence and territorial in tegrity of all emerging democracies in Cen tral and Eastern Europe as vital to European  peace and security.  (5) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3  different occasions since 1949.  (6) Congress has sought to facilitate the  further enlargement of NATO at an early  date by enacting  the NATO Participation  Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22  U.S.C. 1928 note) and the NATO Participa tion Act Amendments of 1995 (section 585 of  Public Law 104-107).  (7) The Partnership for Peace, created in  1994 under American leadership, has fostered  cooperation between NATO and  the coun tries of Central and Eastern Europe, and of fers a path to future membership in the Alli ance and a permanent security relationship  between participants in the Partnership for  Peace and members of NATO.  (8) As new members of NATO assume the  responsibilities of Alliance membership, the  costs of maintaining stability in Europe will  be shared more widely. The concurrent as sumption of greater responsibility and devel opment of greater capabilities by the Euro pean members of NATO in pursuit of a Euro pean security and defense identity will fur ther reinforce burdensharing. Facilitation of  the enlargement process will require current  members of NATO, and the United States in  particular, to demonstrate the political will  needed to build on successful ongoing pro grams such as the Warsaw Initiative and the  Partnership for Peace by making available  the  resources necessary  to supplement ef forts prospective new members are  them selves undertaking.  (9) New members will be full members of  the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assum ing all the obligations under the Washington  Treaty.  (10)  In order  to assist emerging democ racies in Central and Eastern Europe that  have expressed interest in joining NATO to  be prepared to assume the responsibilities of  NATO membership, the United States should  encourage and support efforts by such coun tries  to develop force structures and force  modernization  priorities  that will  enable  such  countries  to contribute  to  the  full  range of NATO missions, including, most im portantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.  (11) Cooperative regional peacekeeping ini tiatives involving emerging democracies in  Central and Eastern Europe  that have ex pressed interest in joining NATO, such as the  Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion,  the Polish Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and  the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force,  can make an important contribution to Eu ropean peace and security and international  peacekeeping efforts, can assist those coun tries preparing to assume the responsibilities  of possible NATO membership, and accord ingly  should  receive  appropriate  support  from the United States.  (12) NATO remains  the only multilateral  security organization capable of conducting  effective military operations and preserving  security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic  region.  (13) NATO  is  an  important diplomatic  forum and has played a positive role in de fusing tensions between members of the Alli ance and, as a result, no military action has  occurred  between  two Alliance member  states since the inception of NATO in 1949.  (14) The process of enlarging NATO to in clude emerging democracies in Central and  Eastern Europe should be a continuing proc ess and progress toward the admission of ad ditional  emerging democracies  in Central  and Eastern Europe will depend on the de gree to which these countries meet the cri teria set  forth  in section 203(d)(3) of  the  NATO Participation Act of 1994.  (15)  Protection  and  promotion  of  fun damental freedoms and human rights is an  integral aspect of genuine security, and in  evaluating  requests  for  membership  in  NATO,  the human  rights  records of  the  emerging democracies in Central and East ern Europe should be evaluated in light of  the obligations and commitments of these  countries under the Charter of the United  Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.  (16) A number of Central and Eastern Euro pean countries have expressed  interest  in  NATO membership, and have taken concrete  steps to demonstrate this commitment; in cluding  their participation  in Partnership  for Peace activities.  (17) Democratic civilian control of defense  forces is an essential element in the process  of preparation for those states interested in  possible NATO membership.  (18) The security and economic stability of  the Caucasus  region  is  important  to  the  United States,  and  the  countries of  the  Caucasus  region  should not be  precluded  from  future membership  in NATO.  The  United States should continue to promote  policies that encourage economic and fiscal  reforms, private sector growth, and political  reforms in the Caucasus region.  (19) In recognition that not all countries  which have requested membership in NATO  will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the  accession date  for each new member may  vary.  (20) The process of NA TO enlargement en tails the consensus agreement of the govern ments of all 16 NATO members and ratifica tion in accordance with their constitutional  procedures.  (21) The  provision  of additional NATO  transition assistance  should  include  those  emerging democracies most ready for closer  ties with NATO and should be designed to as sist other countries meeting specified cri teria of eligibility to move forward toward  eventual NATO membership.  (22) Lasting security and stability in Eu rope requires not only the military integra tion of emerging democracies of Central and  Eastern  Europe  into  existing  European  structures, but also the eventual economic  ",1996
264,House,104,0.415,935,13,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R.  1627,  the Food  Quality  Protection Act,  represents  nearly a decade of effort to modernize  the Federal pesticide regulatory sys tem. Today  the Committee on Agri culture and  the Committee on Com merce will  accomplish what many  thought simply could not be done; that  is, successful consideration on the floor  of a pesticide reform bill.  Mr. Speaker,  this bill has been co sponsored by over 240 Members. This  bill was made possible by a recognition  from all sides of the debate that the  proper use of safe pesticides is a criti cal element in protecting public heal th  and ensuring a safe, abundant, and af fordable food supply for our American  consumers. To that end, H.R. 1627 does  provide wide latitude for the Environ mental Protection Agency to adapt its  regulatory system  to meet  the con stantly  improving scientific  informa tion that is available.  H.R.  1627  reforms  the  outdated  Delaney  clause  to  allow  modern  scien.ce, rather than arbitrary rules, to  be used in evaluating pesticide risks  and benefits. Just as  important, be cause  the new standard will be nar rative rather than specific, this legisla tion will allow the regulatory process  to be adjusted as scientific risks and  benefit assessments simply progress.  H.R. 1627 also provides additional in centives  to  register new,  safer pes ticides  through new authorities  that  allow the EPA to streamline the pes ticide registration procedures, includ ing antimicrobial pesticides.  In addition, the bill provides several  incentives for  interested parties who  wish to pursue the registration of so called ""minor use"" pesticides to ensure  their  availability  in  critical  public  health and agricultural use situations.

In the past 2 years I  have  worked  very  hard,  traveling  through the transit zone and parts of  South America and source country pro grams and we have seen firsthand the  people out there putting their lives on  the  line every day with  limited  re sources.  The sad reality is that we have wit nessed a  record increase in drug use  among America's children between 1992  and 1995, amounting to an aggregate  increase of nearly 200 percent. This re verses a downward  trend that  lasted  from 1979 through 1992. That reversal,  as everyone knows, or should know,  paralleled unprecedented cuts in drug  interdiction,  international  programs  and other supply reduction efforts.  The sudden rise  in youth drug use  and drug related violence  is also ac companied by a dramatic increase in  drug availability on America's streets,  and a major increase in the potency of  these drugs, especially cocaine, hero ine, marijuana flowing into the United  States from Colombia, Bolivia, Peru,  and Mexico.  Mr. Chairman, for the best interest of  our  children  and  grandchildren, we  need a balanced effort of education,  prevention,  treatment,  interdiction,  and source country programs.

Mr. Chairman, I  rise  today to  join  the gentleman from West Virginia in  offering the Mollohan-Fox amendment  to restore vital funding to legal serv ices for the poor in the United States.  I can speak with firsthand knowledge  of the benefits of these legal services  having served on the board of directors  of my own  local  legal aid office  in  Montgomery County, PA.  In  every  district  throughout  this  country, there are citizens who find a  need for legal services and assistance  at trying times in their lives. While  there may be some private resources  available  in some areas,  there  is no  guarantee  that a  private  lawyer or  group will be there to off er pro bono  service.  0 1600  The  Philadelphia Bar Association  raised $100,000 in private donations last  year  to direct  toward legal services.  However,  this valiant effort  cannot  even scratch the surface of need that  exists among our poor.  There are 40 million Americans at or  below the poverty level. In State after  State studies show that no more than  20 percent of the legal needs of the poor  are being met. Even with full funding  for the Legal Services Corporation and  the efforts of the private bar, the legal  needs for low-income Americans exceed  all available resources. Even with full  funding, no one can argue the poor will  have equal access to the courts. In of fering this amendment, we are merely  attempting to ensure that the indigent  of our Nation have some access to the  courts.  This Congress,  through  the appro priations  process, made  significant  changes to the structure of the admin istration of  the Legal Services Cor poration. Most, if not all, of the con cerns and objections about the program  were  responded  to. Legislative  lan guage,  including  the  appropriations  bills, included appropriate restrictions  on class action lawsuits,  legal assist ance to illegal aliens, or representing  individuals evicted from public housing  due  to sale of drugs. These were all  changed.  Now it is time to let the program op erate to fulfill the purposes which we  all endorsed,  to meet the day-to-day  legal problems of the poor.

273,,104,-0.07,1052,13,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Speaker,  the eloquence  and penetrating logic of the Taxpayers Unions'  Sid Taylor graces the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  once again.  MONEY, SYSTEMS AND YOUR HEALTH  (By Sid Taylor)  About 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ chased  the money  changers out of  the Temple.  Today, they're back.  This time, and in our Space Age temple of  finance and fiscal systems, the money chang ers have computers,  satellite communica tions networks and instant money transfer.  With a national debt now around $5.5  tril lion-I have the feeling that our American  temple of democracy is about to experience  Fiscal Shock.  Our American capitalistic system is now  running on ""funny money"". A government  can do this for so long and then the law of  ""supply and .demand"" begins  to move  in.  When you print about 5 trillion paper dol lars, the excess supply of these bills begins  to degrade the value of this kind of unfunded  currency.  The future problem of American citizens  today is not that the stock market might  collapse. It probably won't. There's too much  ""funny money"" now  in circulation  that's  holding it up. The real problem is not an un expected decline in the value of American  stocks, but rather a decline in the value of  the American ""dollar""  itself. The dollar is  the Common Stock in USA Incorporated a  national business  that now has about 255  million  citizen/taxpayer  shareholders.  I'm  one of them.  As a  student of history,  I  feel  that the  shekel of ancient days and our Space Age  American dollar may have much in common.  With federal budget deficits in the S164 bil lion a year range, and interest alone on the  national debt now heading for around $344  billion a year, this is what I mean by Fiscal  Shock. We're being strangled by red tape and  drowning in red ink.  Shakespeare wrote  ""All  the world's a  stage, and all the men and women are merely  players."" Right? No, wrong. He lived in the  Elizabethan era, not today's high-tech Space  Age. All  the world's a system, and all the  men and women are merely subsystems, acti vators, linkages or controls.  The current battle in Congress over reform  of our Sl trillion dollar national health care  ""system"" illustrates the point.  This system is so big and complicated I  feel that if we  taxpayers, the White House  and Congress aren't careful we may unwit tingly legislate ourselves a medical ""Tower  of Babel"". The keyword  is complexity.  In  computer software,  for example, W. Wayt  Gibbs, staff writer for the Scientific Amer ican has pointed out: ""When a system be comes so complex that no one manager can  comprehend the entirety, traditional devel opment processes break down."" He also adds  ""The challenge of complexity  is not only  large but also growing.""  Can you imagine the complexity problem  that we American  taxpayers are about  to  face in reforming our trillion dollar national  health care system? We're going to need wits  and wisdom. This is why I keep preaching  that what this country needs is not a good 5EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cent cigar, but rather a large dose of System  Simplification (SYSIM) in the planning, de sign and operation of many of our billion (or  trillion)  dollar  federal  programs  or net works.  Your life, liberty and the pursuit of happi ness will be affected by the final design of  the national health care SYSTEM. At the  least, it's going to affect your health and  your taxes. And on the subject of abortion,  it's even going to involve a religious issue.  This  is what I mean by complexity. The  Devil hides in red tape, red lights and red  ink. Or to put it another way, delays, defects  and deficits can create ""hell"" in any big sys tem or network.  The message? Simplify, simp, sim, s.  P.S.  COLA-Indexation  of  federal  pay  scales, pension  rates, Social Security and  other government entitlements  is,  in my  opinion, a form of fiscal cancer that eventu ally consumes the entire economic body. It  started around 1972. It's now  time to UN COLA our federal fiscal system.  NO TO BILINGUAL BALLOTS  HON. TOBY ROTII  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 23, 1996  ",1996
274,Senate,104,0.46,1065,13,Mr. KEMPTHORNE.," Mr. President,  in addition, I would like to clarify the  intentions of the Fund for Rural Amer ica  [FRAJ  under  the  Federal Agri culture Improvement and Reform Act.  The FRA specifically designated one third of  the  funding  go  toward  re search, extension, and education grants  that, among other goals, will increase  international  competitiveness,  effi ciency, and farm profitability, and con serve and enhance natural resources.  Further,  the  FRA  research  section  clearly  encourages  interdepartment  and interagency cooperation by allow ing Federal agencies and national lab oratories to be eligible. This is a solid  step toward making the most efficient  use of  limited Federal  research  re sources, and will  facilitate new and  unique applications of technologies to  the agriculture industries.  I would like to clarify that research  to  develop  precision  agriculture,  to  apply remote sensing and information  management  technologies  to  agri culture, is an example of the type of re search  that  the Secretary  of Agri culture should support under the FRA.  I ask the chairman, is that the case?  ",1996
275,Senate,104,0.213,1065,13,Mr. PRESSLER.,"  Mr.  President,  South Dakota farmers and ranchers are  looking to value-added products as one  way to better market their commod ities and products. By adding value to  the  basic  commodity,  farmers  and  ranchers can realize higher prices and  improved  income. This  is being wit nessed for all of agriculture, from grain  farmers to Ii vestock producers.  South Dakota is a  leading State in  finding innovative ways to add value to  agricultural  products.  For  example,  South Dakota is a leader in the produc tion of ethanol and more ethanol facili ties are being planned to be built in  South Dakota.  By the end of the year a new soybean  processing plant will begin production  in a new facility  in Volga, SD. Cur rently  there are serious negotiations  underway for a new beef packing plant  which would service South Dakota and  regional livestock producers.  Another venture  in western South  Dakota is a plan for the Nation's first  lamb packing facility that would com bine slaughtering, breaking, packing,  and shipping under one roof. The facil ity would provide fresh lamb products  to wholesalers and distributors within  the food  industry. The facility would  be called Monument Meats and be lo cated in Belle Fourche, SD.  This effort would be a producer coop erative where producers would be con tracted to provide lambs. The facility,  when completed, would include and in corporate  the suppliers of lamb with  the distributors of the  final product  into the overall process of the proposed  facility.  One area where Federal taxpayer dol lars are efficiently spent is the Rural  Business Enterprise Grants Program.  These grants can be used  to finance  and  facilitate  development of small  and  emerging  business  enterprises.  Promotion and support of a viable U.S.  lamb industry by establishing the pro posed facility would certainly meet the  objectives of these grants.  The proposed lamb processing facil ity for Belle Fourche, SD,  certainly  meets the . test of a promising break through in promoting U.S.  lamb pro duction. A key role of the Federal Gov ernment is to promote innovative and  new business opportunities. A $50,000  grant for a feasibility study of the pro posed lamb processing plant would be  helpful  to demonstrate  to producers  and distributors the benefits that could  be accrued from such a facility.  Supporters of this facility are only  looking for assistance from the Federal  Government  just  for  the  feasibility  study. Once completed, there are no in tentions of further requests for Federal  funding. This seems  to me  to be a  worthwhile investment.  If I could, I would like to ask a few  questions  to my  distinguished  col league from Mississippi, the chairman  of  the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Agriculture.  I  recognize  that  the bill currently  under consideration does not contain  funding for a feasibility study for the  lamb processing plant conceived to be  built in Belle Fourche, SD. However, is  it the chairman's belief that this is the  type of venture where rural business  enterprise grants could come into play?  ",1996
276,Senate,104,-0.45,1078,13,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, this is a  very  important bill  for my State of  California as we are  the number one  ranking agricultural State in the U.S.  While  there  are many  issues  ad dressed in this bill that are important  for my State, I would like to highlight  three California specific issues:  METHYL BROMIDE ALTERNATIVES RESEARCH  I am pleased that the Senate agreed  to my request of an additional $1 mil lion for methyl bromide alternatives  research.  Methyl bromide is critically impor tant to California agriculture for con trol  of  pre-plant  and  post-harvest  pests, and is to date, the only cost-ef fective material for controlling a vari ety of soil-borne pathogens and weeds  that can seriously impact crop yields.  These uses are particularly significant  for commodities such as strawberries,  almonds, walnuts, raisins, and numer ous other field and row crops.  Methyl bromide was listed as a Class  I ozone depleting sub-stance in Decem ber 1993, and according to Section 602  of the Clean Air Act, it must be with drawn  from  production,  importation  and distribution in the U.S. by the year  2001.  My ""Sense of the Senate"" on methyl  bromide included in the farm bill sent  a  clear message  to  the U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture that research into  alternatives to methyl bromide must  be a top priority.  The additional $1 million will bring  the total up to $14.889in1997.  AVOCADOS  I support the concurrence of the Sen ate Committee on Appropriations with  the House  report  language  regarding  the regulation of importation of Mexi can avocados.  Last year the U.S. Department of Ag riculture's Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service  issued a  proposed  rule  governing  the  importation  of  Mexican Hass avocados into the United  States. The proposed rule would allow  Hass avocados to be imported into the  Northeastern United States during the  winter months of November  through  February.  California avocado growers have ex pressed their continued concerns that  the USDA proposed rule inadequately  protects  their industry from harmful  pests or disease that imported avoca dos may carry.  Importation of Mexican avocados has  been prohibited for over 80 years be cause of the presence of at least nine  known quarantined pests of economic  significance. If pest-infested avocados  are allowed into the United States, not  only avocados but other crops such as  citrus, apples, peaches and pears will  be placed at risk.  In light of new scientific data which  indicates that the incidence of avocado  pests in Mexico is significantly higher  than previously thought, it is very im portant that the Department of Agri culture determine whether the original  data it relied on is sound and complete.  If the Secretary cannot make this de termination, I urge the Department to  reopen the rulemaking record on the  proposed rule, and undertake the pro cedures stated in the House report lan guage before issuing a final rule.  FRESH-FROZEN ClilCKEN LABELLING  COMPROMISE  National poultry producers have in  the past always put fresh labels on fro zen chickens. They freeze their chicken  rock solid, label it fresh,  transport it  across  the U.S.,  thaw it out  locally,  and sell it to consumers as if it had  never been frozen.  As the author of the Truth in Poultry  Labeling Act, I have for years worked  to disallow the use of the fresh label  where a poultry product has been pre viously frozen.  Last year, after many years of public  debate, we achieved a hard-fought vic tory for consumers when the U.S. De partment of Agriculture promulgated a  common sense rule on labeling fresh  and frozen poultry. The rule which had  been scheduled to take effect this Au gust sets out three labeling categories:  fresh  poultry  products which  have  never  been  chilled  below  poultry's  ""freezing po in t-26 degrees Fahrenheit would be  labelled ""fresh""; 2) poultry  products which have been chilled below  26 degrees but above O degrees would be  labelled ""hard chilled"" or ""previously  hard chilled""; and 3) poultry products  which have been at O degrees or below  would be  labelled  ""frozen"" or  ""pre viously frozen.""  I believe that the implementation of  the  USDA-promulgated  rule  would  eliminate  consumer  confusion,  save  consumers millions of dollars in pre miums paid for frozen poultry they be lieve is fresh, and further restore con sumer trust in the integrity of food la bels.  However,  language was  included in  the  1996 Agriculture Appropriations  bill,  that blocked  implementation of  the rule. My attempt  to remove  the  language in order to allow USDA im plementation of  the  rule was voted  down by a vote of 31 to 68.  Since  then,  industry and consumer  groups  have  reached  a  compromise  ",1996

278,,104,0.382,1117,13,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  to  join  Senators MACK  and  LIEBERMAN  in  sponsoring  legislation  designed to spur economic growth in  the District of Columbia. The economic  circumstances  in  the District  have  eroded so significantly that they can  no longer be casually dismissed. Fail ure to act now with investment incen tives would cost the District even more  in lost financial opportunities-financial opportunities the District, and in deed our entire Nation, cannot afford  to miss.  Opponents of this legislation may be  critical of the special treatment given  to the District of Columbia as opposed  to other areas of the country. Yet, this  should be  the greatest city  in  the  world-east of Salt Lake City.  In all seriousness, however, I believe  that it is imperative that the Capital  of our Nation stand for democracy, eco nomic development, and security. It is  difficult for the District of Columbia to  represent  these qualities when it has  become nearly unmanageable and is on  the brink of financial ruin. Something  must be done to breathe new life into  Washington, DC. Otherwise,  I've got  some ghost towns in Utah I can show  you.  And, I want to emphasize that we are  not talking about an infusion of Fed eral funds. We are  talking about en couraging private sector investment in  the city. We are talking about incen tives for people to live here. This legis lation provides a way to bring both the  capital and stability needed  to start  the healing process.  The components included in this bill  are specifically designed  to revitalize  our Nation's Capital. First,  the bill  would tax all D.C. residents at a flat  rate of 15 percent and significantly in crease  their standard deductions, yet  retain both the charitable contribution  deduction and the home mortgage de duction. This provision would give the  middle class who left because of rising  taxes a new incentive to return to the  District and once again call it home. In  fact, this recovery plan also establishes  a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home  buyers for residences purchased within  the District of Columbia. These types  of incentives would have a real and im mediate  impact on  the District and  would help  replace  the middle-class  base that has slowly been eroding.  In addition to these provisions, Mr.  President,  this  legislation eliminates  the capital gains  tax on any  invest ment made within the District of Co lumbia by  residents and greatly  re duces it for nonresidents. This part of  the bill provides the District access to  a  tremendous source of capital, other wise unavailable.  Not only would this proposal begin to  restore  the financial viability of our  Nation's capital city, it would also pro vide a testing ground for studying the  effects of the basic principles of fun damental tax reform. Our current sys tem of taxation has been much criti cized over the past year and a half, and  I agree that steps should be taken to ward a  fairer, simpler, and more effi cient  tax  system.  However,  while  change may be necessary, it must also  be done carefully and deliberately. Ini tiating a flat tax system in the District  of Columbia  could  give  legislators  much-needed  insight  into  tax reform  ",1996
279,House,104,-0.297,1221,13,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  truth hurts and the truth is that what  the  Speaker  asserted  in  1995,  that  Medicare should wither on the vine is  still true in his opinion in 1996.  The truth also is that this is a Con gress  that has  reacted when people  have opposed  their positions  in very  negative and harmful ways to all of us.  In 1995 they threw a national temper  tantrum  and  shut  the Government  down because they could not get what  they wanted. And now  in 1996 when  working men and women who are mem bers of unions like the laborer's union  exercise  their constitutional right  to  protest statements like this, they try  to  intimidate, coerce, and shut them  down with hearings like those that are  happening today. Real crime is happen ing on the streets of America but the  crime  is not happening with  state ments like this. We ought to give peo ple the right to say what they want.  The truth, indeed, hurts.  0 1015  TRIBUTE TO MUHAMMAD ALI  (Mr. WARD asked amd was given per mission  to address  the house  for 1  ",1996
280,House,104,-0.396,1234,13,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Chairman, I am in  strong support of the Deutsch amend ment. As you know, I was a police offi cer and have been a strong advocate of  the COPS Program. At the age of 32 I  suffered  a  permanent  injury.  I  am  medically retired  from  the Michigan  State Police. At the time I was 32 years  old.  I have  two children and a wife.  How do you provide, not just for the in juries that you have suffered, but how  [Mr.  do you provide for your family, how do  you provide for your children heal th  coverage if the jurisdiction that hired  you does not provide it?  The Deutsch amendment says those  that are involved in emergency situa tions,  firefighters and police officers,  would be allowed to continue their in surance coverage for not only  them selves but also their families. We ask  much of police officers and firefighters.  The least we can do, when they are in jured performing their duties, is to pro vide at least some degree of respect ability and financial stability by pro viding heal th insurance for them.  I was  fortunate  that  the State of  Michigan provided that for me when I  received my  injuries,  but  unfortu nately, as the gentleman from Florida  [Mr. DEUTSCH] has pointed out, that is  not the case all around this country.  We ask many  things of police offi cers.  I would ask  that we not  leave  them hanging,  that we provide some  degree of security for them and their  families when they do meet these per manently disabling injuries.  ",1996
281,House,104,0.296,1234,13,Mr. HEINEMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in  strong  support  of  the Deutsch  amendment. It is an amendment based  on the Alu-O'Hara Public Safety Bene fits Act. As a 39-year law enforcement  officer veteran, I know how difficult it  is for public safety officers to put their  lives on the line day after day protect ing the public.  Last year two would-be rescuers, po lice officers Alu and O'Hara, were seri ously burned when  they entered an  apartment where  a  deranged person  was holding two hostages. Tragically,  the two hostages and the officers were  doused with gasoline by  the hostage  taker, who set fire to both the officers  and the hostages. The hostages died.  After nearly losing their lives, the of ficers and their families who depended  on them lost their health benefits. Un like veterans who have  risked  their  lives to protect our national security,  those who protect our community can  lose everything if they are injured in  the line of duty. Public safety officers  who suffer career-ending injuries often  have  their health insurance canceled  by municipalities or States that they  were fighting to protect.  This bipartisan legislation would cre ate a  safety net for  injured officers.  This amendment creates an incentive  for communities that receive Federal  crime dollars  to extend heal th insur ance to officers who are injured in the  line of duty and would otherwise be left  without health coverage. I urge my col leagues to support the Deutsch amend ment.  ",1996
282,House,104,0.465,1247,13,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  reluctant opposition  to  this  amendment. The subject matter of this  amendment  is patent  law and  it  is  based on an earlier  legislative pro posal, H.R. 1127. Both the subject mat ter of patents and H.R. 1127 are within  the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Com mittee. The effect of this amendment  is to strip the Judiciary Committee of  its jurisdiction over this issue by at tempting to legislate on this appropria tions bill. For this reason alone  this  amendment should be rejected.  In  addition,  the  Judiciary  Sub committee on Courts and Intellectual  Property, which I chair, held a hearing  on H.R. 1127,  the legislation on which  this amendment is based. During that  hearing, a representative of the Patent  and Trademark Office suggested that  the PTO may well be able to address  the issues raised by the legislation by  modifying  their  internal, administra tive procedures. I subsequently wrote  to  the Commissioner of Patents and  Trademarks  and  requested  that  the  PTO hold hearings on this issue.  Pursuant to my request the PTO con ducted a public hearing on issues relat ed to patenting of medical procedures.  Interested parties were given  the op portunity  to comment and offer sug gestions for improvements. The PTO is  now  analyzing  these  comments  and  preparing  to  address  the  problems  which are identified. There  is a very  good chance that this problem may be  solved administratively for which the  gentleman from Iowa should take full  credit. I believe that this is the appro priate  response and accordingly urge  the rejection of this amendment.  I should state that this amendment  is opposed by the U.S. Department of  Commerce,  the American Intellectual  Property Law Association,  the Intel lectual  Property Owners,  the  Bio technology Industry Organization, the  American Bar Association,  and  the  Pharmaceutical Research and Manu facturers of America.  I believe that a  reasonable problem  has been pointed out by the gentleman  from Iowa, and I believe that it is im portant to find out the best way that  we can solve it, but I do not think it  should be done on an appropriation bill  with short notice.  0 1300  ",1996

292,,104,-0.328,1364,13,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to the life of Selma Jean Cohen, a  Baltimorean who recently died after dedicating  much of her life to helping others.  Mrs. Cohen, who died July 2 at the age of  75, was born in an era that did not encourage  women to develop all their talents. But that did  not stop her from marching to her own drum mer and taking on new challenges. As a moth er, wife, volunteer and professional woman,  she  found  innumerable ways  throughout her  life to make a difference in her community and  in  the  lives of hundreds of families she be friended in times of need.  In her early years of raising her two sons,  Ellis and Jerome, Mrs. Cohen was a PTA  president, a Cub Scout den mother and  the  president of the sisterhood at her synagogue.  After her sons were grown, Mrs. Cohen began  a career at the State department of health and  mental hygiene where she became the direc tor of nursing home bed  registry, a position  she held for 25 of her 34 years with the de partment.  July 24, 1996  But her work with the State was just part of  her dedication to helping others. Mrs. Cohen  and her husband, Leonard, whom she met at  a Benny Goodman dance in 1940, have been  weekend volunteers at the Ronald McDonald  House  in Baltimore for the past 1 O years.  In  their work at  the Ronald McDonald House,  they comforted out-of-town families with very  sick children at Baltimore area hospitals and  made these  families  feel at home. She and  Leonard also found time to do hospice work at  Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hos pital and help sick children at  the Mount  Washington Pediatric Hospital.

293,,104,0.541,1364,13,Mr. FIELDS of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  it was  with mixed emotions that I announced last De cember  11 my decision  to  retire  from  the  House at the conclusion of my current term.  As I explained at the time, the decision to re tire was made more difficult because of the  loyalty and dedication of my staff-and be cause of the genuine friendship I feel for each  of  them. They have served  the men and  women of Texas' 8th Congressional District in  an extraordinary way.  Today, I want to thank one member of my  staff-Risden Wall, a legislative assistant who  is serving a congressional  fellowship through  the Brookings  Institution. Risden  is a senior  special agent with the U.S. Customs Service  who began his congressional fellowship in my  office in January 1995.  Risden, a native of Ridgeland, SC, earned  an associate degree from Brewton Parker Jun ior College  in 1966, and  received his bach elors degree from Florida State University  in  1970. From 1967 to 1969, he served  in  the  U.S. Army as an airborne combat infantryman  with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg,  NC, and as a rifleman/radio transmitting oper ator with  the 173rd Airborne Brigade  in  the  Republic of Vietnam.  After leaving the Army and obtaining his col lege degree, Risden went to work for the U.S.  Customs Service in Miami, where he served  as a ""sky mars hall,"" charged with deterring  possible skyjacketings of domestic and  inter national commercial  flights. Soon  thereafter,  Risden served as a special agent in the Cus toms Service's Miami office-working to pre vent narcotics smuggling, money  laundering,  fraud and other criminal activities. He served  in that position for 12 years before moving to  Washington to become a senior special agent  at Customs Service headquarters, where he  worked on financial  investigations and under cover operations.  In 1986, Risden was asked to represent the  Customs Service on  the National Drug En forcement Policy Board. On  the board,  he  ",1996
294,House,104,0.256,10,17,Ms. MOLINARI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 2594, the Railroad Unemploy ment  Insurance Amendments Act of 1996.  This  important  legislation will modernize rail road unemployment and sickness benefits so  that they are more in keeping with the State  systems that apply to all other industries.  Too often Republicans are accused of sup porting  the  interests of big business over  those of  the working people.  I am pleased  today to stand in support of legislation that will  directly benefit the interests of working people.  H.R. 2594 will increase the daily benefits pay able to unemployed rail workers from $36 to  $42. It will also reduce the waiting time before  benefits begin  to accrue  from 14 days to 7  days. This means an automatic  increase of  $294 for any qualified employees. The cost to  the industry of these increased benefits will be  partially offset by a reduction in the maximum  number of days of extended benefits, and a  reduction in the permissible amount of outside  income.  These increased rail unemployment benefits  will not  impost any additional costs on  the  American  taxpayer. Because the railroad un employment system is funded through payroll  taxes, the  industry will bear the  full costs of  the new benefits.  This bill has been awaiting enactment for a  long time. The House passed virtually identical  legislation  in  the 103d Congress, but it was  never taken up by the Senate. Because of the  complicated budgetary effects of  the  legisla tion,  it has taken a long  time  to be able  to  bring the  legislation to this point.  I also want  to thank my colleagues on the Budget Com mittee for assisting our efforts in bringing this  legislation forward.  I urge my colleagues to vote ""yes"" on H.R.  2594.  ",1996
295,House,104,0.672,49,17,Mr. SCARBOROUGH.," Mr. Speaker,  Medicare is bleeding to death. It is los ing more money than it ever has be fore.  In 1995  the President's Medicare  trustees said that Medicare would be  bankrupt by 2002. This year we hear  that it is bleeding to death even faster  and it is going to be bankrupt by 2000.  In 1993 President Clinton understood  that fact and so he proposed that Medi care spending's rate of increase go to  6.9 percent. In 1995 we understood that,  so we proposed a 7.1-percent increase.  We were absolutely savaged by a mi nority  that was so desperate  to get  back into control that the truth meant  absolutely nothing and  they shame lessly demagogued on this issue.  In fact, let me give you a few quotes,  not from Republican publications but  from publications  that have consist ently supported the Democratic Party.  The Washington  Post  accused  the  Democratic minority  of  shameless  demagoguery. Those are  their words,  not mine.  ",1996
296,House,104,-0.166,62,17,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Alabama for yield ing. I, too, Mr. Speaker, rise today to  pay tribute to two fine gentlemen from  the State of Alabama. I am also proud  to be here among the other folks that  are here paying tribute. I find myself  in excellent company.  I have had  the privilege of serving  with these two gentlemen for my ten ure here in the Congress. I feel like it  has been a real honor to be along their  side.  Congressman TOM BEVILL has served  the Fourth District of Alabama with  distinction  since  1966,  but  in many  wavs he has served all of our districts  at one time or another. As chairman of  the Energy and Water Appropriations  Subcommittee from 1977  to 1994, Con gressman BEVILL  has  probably been  more  instrumental than any Member  in protecting, preserving, and manag ing America's water resources.  His charge has not been an easy one  in  distributing  an  ever-shrinking  amount of funds to an ever-increasing  number of worthy projects from around  the Nation. Yet he has always been fair  and nonpartisan in his work, and his  word is ironclad.  When I first came to Congress 4 years  ago, the appropriations process was an  unintelligible maze to me. In an effort  to understand the process better and to  serve my district, I went to TOM BE VILL  for advice. It could have been a  very intimidating experience, a young  woman, new on Capitol Hill, visiting a  powerful chairman, but it was not. TOM  BEVILL welcomed me as an equal and  treated me with the utmost of respect.  He helped me  learn more about  the  process and was instrumental in guid ing several landmark Arkansas water  projects through the Congress, one on  behalf of the people of the First Dis trict of Arkansas. I want to thank him  for his hard work on our behalf.  I know that Mr. BEVILL's best days  are ahead of him as he leaves Congress  to return to his life of a private citizen.  I want to wish him and his wife Lou  the best.  There  is one story  I  think  that I  must share with the rest of my col leagues, and I think it says a little bit  !  that we all really  about Mr. BEVILL  know.  Not only has he served the people of  this country and of Alabama and all of  our other districts well, he has done so  in a very wise and gentlemanly way,  but he has not forgotten the important  things in life. One day as we sat on the  floor here, Mr. BEVILL and I were visit ing, and I had on a red jacket. And he  looked at me and he said: I see you in  that red jacket and, he said, I am re minded. My wife was wearing a  red  jacket the day that we first had our think it was the day you proposed to  her, perhaps? Or maybe it was your  first date.  TOM BEVILL does not forget, and he  does not  forget  the most  important  things in life. He has served us all very  well in this institution. He served our  Nation and the folks of Alabama. We  would all do well to follow the example  of his career,  commitment,  fairness,  grace, and humility. TOM BEVILL is the  kind of Member and person that we all  strive to be, and I am proud to have  served here with him and  to  have  learned so much.  Mr. Speaker,  I also want  to say a  word about my  fellow Congressman,  GLEN BROWDER, from Alabama's Third  District. I have had the true honor of  serving as a blue dog with GLEN during  the 104th Congress. GLEN,  like myself,  is a founding member of this notorious  band of  independent Democrats. We  have worked hard for that name and  have had a great deal of fun with it.  The blue dog mission, however, has  been  about meeting  two  principal  goals: balancing  the budget  in a  fis cally responsible as well as a fair way,  and bringing commonsense solutions to  Washington, DC.  Since coming  to Congress  in 1989,  GLEN  has never  swayed  from  those  goals. He was instrumental in crafting  the blue dogs' balanced budget and had  an active voice in all of our policy deci sions.  I am not sure what GLEN'S plans are  for the future, but I certainly know he  will bring  the same dedications and  honor to his new endeavors as he has to  his work here in Congress. I  join my  colleagues in honoring these two gen tlemen, and I wish them Godspeed in  the future ahead for both of them.  ",1996

300,Senate,104,0.271,101,17,Mr. GORTON.," Within  the programs  authorized in S. 1994, the Federal Avia tion Administration  reauthorization  bill, are allocations for noise mitiga tion. Under the Airport Improvement  Program  [AIP],  the Federal Aviation  Administration  [FAA]  has  allocated  funds to airports of all sizes to imple ment noise mitigation programs. Due  to lower funding levels of the AIP, the  FAA has recently implemented a rule  that  limits an airport  to $8 million  maximum for Federal noise mitigation  funds-$5 million a year for single family housing and $3 million a year for all  other uses.  Mr. President, while this type of new  cap may be appropriate in certain cir cumstances, I believe that a single cap,  regardless of an airport  interests or  needs, is inappropriate for two reasons.  First, in evaluating existing noise pro grams around the country, I think it is  evident  that  certain  airports  have  made noise mitigation a  top priority.  Seattle-Tacoma International Airport,  for  example,  has been  the national  leader and was the first to implement  the  local housing insulation program  to reduce noise impacts in houses sur rounding the airport. Having enacted  noise mitigation programs, certain air ports that enacted plans prior to impo sition of this new cap, and after exten sive  negotiations  and  commitments  with  both  the  surrounding  commu nities and the FAA, are now expected  to follow through on previous commit ments. If the program cost exceeds the  new cap, the FAA is essentially aban doning its previous commitments. I be lieve that is unacceptable.  Second, it is clear that large airports  in densely populated areas should have  to implement broader noise mitigation  programs than small, general aviation  airports. For that reason, a single, hard  cap for all airports, regardless of size  and location, is not the best way to dis tribute funds in an equitable manner.  Mr. President, the Senator from Ari zona knows that I included language in  the fiscal year 1997 Transportation ap propriations Senate report that directs  the FAA to consider pledges and agree ments made by the airport authority,  in consultation with the FAA, to com munities prior to the promulgation of  the new ceiling, and  to make appro priate exceptions to the policy where  necessary to meet legitimate expecta tions of neighborhoods near airports.  Because the fiscal year 1997 Transpor tation appropriations House report was  silent on  the  issue,  the Senate  lan guage is the prevailing language that  should be followed by the FAA.  I believe it is appropriate, however,  to also discuss this matter within the  context of  this  legislation  to ensure  that my sentiments on this issue are  correct.  Mr. McCAIN.  I agree with the Sen ator from Washington. We all under stand  that,  in an era of constrained  budgets, it may be necessary for the  FAA to try to limit noise mitigation  funds per airport. As the Senator men tioned, however,  I  agree  that where  prior commitments have been made it  is necessary and appropriate that the  FAA  show  flexibility  so  that  those  commitments may be honored.

301,,104,0.176,270,17,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, all eyes in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania-and increas ingly  throughout  the  Nation-are  fixed  admiringly on Clarion County.  I have the pleasure to report  that Clarion  County, in the Fifth Congressional District, is  the selection for the prestigious Community of  the Year honor by  the Pennsylvania State  Chamber of Business and  Industry. And  this  distinction follows on the heels of the Clarion  River's selection for tribute during Pennsylva nia's River Month last June.  On what grounds, Mr. Speaker,  is Clarion  County sweeping all honors this year? I have  a hunch, and  I will share  it with you. But  I  maintain that the best way for you and our col leagues to understand  is  for each of you  to  visit for yourselves.  That's because Clarion County  is nothing  short of a stunning natural treasure. And,  im portantly, those who call it home recognize its  wonders and  true value. They share a very  real commitment to serve as its stewards not  only for today but for all future generations.  And  it's paying off. Their dedication to pre serving the beauty of northwest Pennsylvania  has contributed to the region's flourishing rep utation as a  tourist's haven. The dividends,  cautiously earned, will continue  to be paid  through the years.  I am especially pleased, Mr. Speaker,  to  share  this honor with my colleagues  in  the  House today. Just hours ago, the Resources  Committee  reported  legislation  to designate  51.7 miles of the Clarion River as part of the  National Wild and Scenic River System. This  legislation is really the product of 41h years of  impassioned public effort, and  I ask  for  the  support of the House to enact it in the waning  days of the 104th Congress.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity  to off er my most sincere congratulations to the  people of Clarion County, PA.  HEALTH CARE FOR KIDS  HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 18, 1996  ",1996
302,,104,-0.631,270,17,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  introducing  today a bill to require insurers to off er health  insurance policies for kids, coupled with a slid ing scale 80 percent refundable tax credit to  help families buy such insurance policies.  There are 1 O million children  in the United  States without health insurance. Health insur ance equals access to health care. Access to  health care equals better health and a better  quality of life. It is that simple. As a recent arti cle in the Journal of the American Medical As sociation (JAMA, August 14, 1996, p. 477) so  well said:  ... access to health care is dramatically  increased if one has health insurance, and  this increased access has in turn been shown  to improve outcomes, such as whether one  lives or dies. The most significant action  within the health system that we can take to  preserve health and improve longevity is to  provide heal th insurance to everyone.  The bill  I am  introducing  is about  the  life  and death-and  lifetime productivity-of our  Nation's children.  This bill  is not a mandate;  it does not re quire any individual to buy health insurance. It  does, however, make sure that there is wide spread competition  in  the offering of  these  health insurance policies and it does help fam ilies, even very low income families, buy a pol icy of their choice.  Health insurance for children in America is  getting worse-not better. With  the cuts  in  Medicaid,  it may get disastrously worse. We  desperately need to reverse the trend of rising  uninsured rates for children. The General Ac counting Office recently issued report to Sen ator  CHRISTOPHER  DODD,  dated  June  17,  1996, entitled ""Health Insurance for Children:  Private Insurance Coverage Continues to De teriorate""  (GAO/HEHS-96-129). The  report  states:  The number of children without health in surance coverage was greater in 1994 than at  any time in the last 8 years. In 1994, the per centage of children under 18 years old with out any health insurance coverage reached  its highest level since 1987-14.2 percent or 10  million children who were uninsured. In ad dition, the percentage of children with pri vate coverage has decreased every year since  1987, and in 1994 reached its lowest level in  the past 8 yea~.6 percent.  To repeat, health  insurance can mean the  difference between  life and death-and be tween a good quality  life and a stunted  life.  The GAO's report I have just cited provides a  concise summary of why the lack of insurance  is so important:  Studies have shown that uninsured chil dren are less likely than insured children to  get needed health and preventive care. The  lack of such care can adversely affect chil dren's health status throughout their lives.  Without health  insurance, many  families  face difficulties getting preventive and basic  care  for  their children. Children without  health insurance or with gaps in coverage  are less likely to have routine doctor visits  or have a  regular source of medical care.  They are also less likely to get care for inju ries, see a physician if chronically ill, or get  dental care. They are less likely to be appro priately immunized to prevent childhood 111ness-which is considered by health experts  to be one of the most basic elements of pre ventive care.  My bill is a small, incremental step forward.  If is by no means everything I would like. If I  could waive a magic wand, I would make sure  that everyone  in America had high quality  health  insurance  tomorrow morning. That  is  not going  to happen-but  this  small  step,  starting with children, could help millions of  children grow up to be healthier, more produc tive citizens. Like my amendment which start ed  the COBRA Health Continuation Program  which has been used by 40 million Americans,  this bill could make a world of difference to  millions of Americans in the years ahead.  Under the bill,  insurance companies would  be subject to a tax penalty if they did not off er  for sale-so-called guaranteed issue-a policy  which provided a Medicare-type package of  health benefits, with additions designed  for  well-baby and well-child care and with a 1 O  percent-but no more  than $10 per Part B  service-rather  than Medicare's 20 percent  copay. By  requiring  insurers to off er such a  benefit package, consumers will be able  to  shop widely for a policy they can afford. The  competition in this sector should help make af fordable policies available.  The key problem is to make this policy af fordable to the families of the 1 O million unin sured. The basic reason so many children are  uninsured is that they are in working families  which are not eligible  for Medicaid, but  the  families do not have health insurance offered  through the workplace and cannot afford the  $500 to $700 per child these policies will prob ably cost. Therefore,  I propose a refundable  tax credit to make the policies affordable. The  tax credit/payment will be phased out at the  rate of 50 cents per dollar of tax liability of the  purchaser.  In the past, refundable tax credits have had  integrity problems.  I propose  to avoid  this  abuse of the program by requiring that the tax payer submit a 1099 type form with their tax  form, in which the insurance company will cer tify that a tax-qualified kid's insurance policy  has been purchased. The companies will, of  course, also submit this documentation directly  to the IRS so that a data match can be per formed before refunds are issued.  I do not spell out how the 80 percent credit  is to be financed, but the money can be found  as part of a future reconciliation bill.  If addi tional funds can be found, the credit percent age can be phased out more slowly to help  additional families.  To repeat, the bill is not a mandate, but a  chance for parents to have affordable private  health insurance for their children. It uses the  private market exclusively. It is a first step and  as additional moneys become available, we  can add a maternity and prenatal benefit for  mothers-to-be and a slower phaseout of the  credit.  I welcome cosponsors of the bill, and com ments and suggestions  from  the public on  ways to improve the bill and to help finance  the proposal.  I am  introducing the bill late in  this Congress so  that the public can  review  the bill before the start of the 105th Congress  ",1996
303,House,104,0.203,283,17,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, the  gentleman from Georgia [Mr. LEWIS),  the gentleman  from California  [Mr.  FAZIO] earlier, are absolutely correct. I  would like to join my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle in publicly stat ing that the American people and this  Congress have not only the right, but  we as representatives of those people  have the responsibility to see the Com mittee on Standards of Official Con duct complete its process, when it is  complete. I repeat, when it is complete.  The Committee on Standards of Offi cial Conduct, chaired by  the gentle woman from Connecticut [Mrs.  JOHN SON], our colleague, has conducted this  investigation  in accordance with  the  rules established by this House.  When the committee has completed  its responsibilities, I am confident that  the report will be made public and then  the American people and the House of  Representatives will have  the oppor tunity and  the  responsibility  to  re spond to those conclusions.  Until such time, I would call on my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  let the rules of the House and the Com mittee on Standards of Official Con duct complete its task and its respon sibility.  I believe  that will be done  properly.  HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR A  REASONABLE INVESTIGATION?

304,House,104,0.453,283,17,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  after a decade of progress under Ronald  Reagan and George Bush, Bill Clinton  is leading the full-scale retreat on the  war on drugs.  Upon arriving  in  the White House,  Bill Clinton began by dismantling the  war on drugs. He began by slashing the  U.S. military's drug interdiction budg et by 1,000 positions. In February 1993,  he eliminated 83 percent of the staff at  the Office of National Drug Policy.  That is where the drug czar works.  Bill Clinton  cut Customs  Service  interdiction by 20 percent. And to top  it off, in December 1993, the Clinton-ap pointed Surgeon General, Jocelyn El ders, publicly talked about drug legal ization.  Mr. Speaker, is it any surprise that  under Bill Clinton's watch the number  of 12to 17-year-olds using marijuana  has doubled? And marijuana use today  starts at a younger age. The average  age of first use is about 13112 years.  The children of  today are coming  under  the era of  the President who  said, I didn't inhale. And now it is our  communities that are feeling the pain.  ",1996

307,,104,0.52,465,17,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr.  President,  the  Washington Post  today had an edi torial  that was critical of me. Basi cally, it said, wait a minute, we grant ed waivers to other areas. Why would  you  try and  take away parts of the  waiver-they actually said we were re pealing the entire waiver. They were  wrong. Why would you do this just for  for  if not  the District of Columbia  other areas?  The legislation I introduced, frankly,  did not apply just to the District of Co lumbia. It says a 5-year time limit air  plies  to  everybody  in  the  country.  There won't be a single waiver to ex empt someone from  the 5-year limit.  That was the guts of the bill. There  would not be a waiver that would undo  work requirements. Those were the two  major elements of the bill. It just so  happens that the District of Columbia  was the only waiver request that went  directly away from welfare reform.  There are 30 States, plus the District  of Columbia, who have received welfare  waivers. Guess what? All 30, except for  the District of Columbia, moved  to ward work requirements, toward time  limits-most of which had shorter time  limits than 5 years. But not the Dis trict of Columbia; it was a waiver away  from welfare reform, a waiver for the  status quo, and it was a waiver, basi cally, where President Clinton and the  Clinton  administration was  saying:  District of Columbia, you are exempt  from welfare  reform. We don't think  you need to do it.  I am pleased I finally hear that HHS  has rescinded the order. I believe they  did it because it is the political season,  and they knew they were going to take  some heat. They made a serious mis take. But we have to make sure they  are not just postponing it for 2 months.  We want to make absolutely sure that  there  is no way that sometime after  the election,  in November or Decem ber, they would go ahead and grant a  10-year waiver. We want to make sure  that is not up their sleeve. If we have  to pass  legislation  to make  sure of  that, we will do it. There is no reason  in the world why we would work as  hard as we did for real welfare reform  for everybody in the country-to end  cash assistance as an open-ended enti tlement, a perpetual way of living-and  not do it in the District of Columbia.  I might mention, Mr. President,  I  think there are some games that were  played. This waiver  request  by  the  Clinton administration was granted in  14 days. I might tell my colleagues that  some areas have had waiver requests  pending before the administration for  months,  some  for years,  some  for 2  years, all of which were trying to have  a waiver from the old law, which would  not allow  time  limits. Most of  the  waivers that States wanted to enact,  like Wisconsin, Illinois, Oklahoma, and  others, wanted to have time limits and  work requirements. They wanted peo ple to get off welfare and go to work.  They wanted to have learnfare require ments where children of welfare recipi ents would be required to go to school,  like every other child. If they didn't  have their kids in school, they would  lose welfare payments; or they have to  make sure their kids receive vaccina tions, or they might receive penalties.  ",1996
308,Senate,104,0.391,478,17,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, pur suant  to section 303 of the Congres sional Accountability Act of 1995  (2  U.S.C. sec. 1383(b)), a notice of adoption  of amendments to procedural rules was  submitted by the Office of Compliance,  U.S. Congress. The notice publishes  adopted amendments to the rules gov erning the procedures for the Office of  Compliance under  the Congressional  Accountability Act.  Section 304(b)  requires  this notice  and  the amendments to  the rules be  printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  Therefore  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  the notice and amendments be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as fallows:  OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE-THE CONGRESSIONAL  ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995: AMENDMENTS  TO PROCEDURAL RULES  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO  PROCEDURAL RULES  Summary: After considering comments to  the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pub lished July 11,  1996  in  the Congressional  Record, the Executive Director has adopted  and is publishing amendments to the rules  governing the procedures for  the Office of  Compliance  under  the Congressional Ac countability Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat.  3). The amendments to the procedural rules  have been approved by the Board of Direc tors, Office of Compliance.  For Further Information Contact: Executive  Director, Office of Compliance, Room LA 200,  110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.  20540-1999. Telephone No. 202-724-9250.  SUPPLEMENT ARY INFORMATION:  I. Background  The Congressional Accountability Act of  1995 (""CAA"" or ""Act"") was enacted into law  on January 23, 1995. In general, the CAA ap plies the rights and protections of eleven fed eral labor and employment law statutes to  covered  employees  and  employing offices  within the legislative branch. Section 303 of  the CAA directs that the Executive Director  of the Office of Compliance (""Office"") shall,  subject to the approval of the Board of Direc tors (""Board"") of the Office, adopt rules gov erning the procedures for the Office, and may  amend those rules in the same manner. The  procedural  rules  currently  in  effect,  ap proved by the Board and adopi;ed by the Ex ecutive Director, were published December  22,  1995  in  the Congressional Record  (141  Cong. R. S 19239 (daily ed., Dec. 22, 1995)). The  revisions and additions that follow amend  certain of the existing procedures by which  the Office provides for the consideration and  resolution of alleged violations of the laws  made applicable under Part A of title II of  the CAA, and establish procedures for con sideration of matters arising under Part D of  title II of the CAA, which is generally effec tive October l, 1996.  Pursuant to section 303(b) of the CAA, the  Executive Director published for comment a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Con gressional Record on July 11, 1996 (142 Cong.  R. 87685-88, H7450-54 (daily ed., July 11, 1996))  inviting comments regarding  the proposed  amendments to the procedural rules. Three  comments were received in response to the  NPR: two from Congressional offices and one  from a labor organization. After full consid eration of the comments received, the Exec utive Director has, with the approval of the  Board,  adopted  these amendments  to  the  procedural rules.  II. Consideration of Comments and Conclusion~  A. Definition of participant  One  commenter  suggested  deleting  the  terms ""labor organization"" and ""employing  office"" from the definition of ""participant""  found at section 1.07(c) of the proposed rules.  The commenter noted that a ""party"" is in cluded in the definition of participant and  the term ""party"" is defined in section 1.02(i)  of the rules as including a labor organization  or employing office.  The final rule, as adopted and approved, in corporates the modification suggested by the  commenter.  B. Contents or records of confidential  proceedings  One commenter asked that section 1.07(d)  of the rules be revised to reflect the com menter s understanding that ""an employing  office may acknowledge the existence of a  complaint and the general allegations being  made by an employee, and the employing of fice may deny the allegations."" This com menter  further  requested  that  the phrase  ""information forming the basis for the alle gation,"" found  in the same section of the  rules,  be  defined. According  to  the com menter, the phrase is ambiguous. The com menter did not, however,  identify  the as serted ambiguity.  The statute requires that the filing of a  complaint and  its subject matter be kept  confidential. Thus,  it  is not  permissible  under the statute, as enacted-much less the  procedural rules implementing the statute for an employing office to disclose the infor mation described. Moreover, no ambiguity  has been  identified or  is apparent which  would warrant modifying the proposed rule.  Accordingly, the rule has been adopted and  approved without modification.  C. Requests for extension of the mediation  period  Two commenters correctly point out that,  although it was noted in the preamble of the  NPR that section 2.04(e)(2) is proposed to be  modified to allow oral as well as written re quests for the extension of the mediation pe riod, the actual text of the proposed revision  was inadvertently omitted. Although neither  commenter stated an objection to the sub stance of the proposed revision, one com menter requested that the text of the pro posed amendment be published and the com ment period be extended prior to its adop tion.  The proposed amendment, and its intent,  were clearly explained in the NPR so as to  give sufficient notice of the proposed modi fication. And as the adoption of the amended  rule will not work a disservice to any party  to a mediation, but rather will enable all  parties to more fully utilize the mediation  process,  the proposed modification  to  the  rule has been adopted and approved.  D. Answer to complaint  All  three commenters expressed concern  that proposed section 5.0l(f) could be inter preted to foreclose a respondent from raising  certain affirmative defenses or  interposing  certain  denials.  One  commenter  further  urged the adoption of a  specific rule that  would allow the filing of a motion to dismiss  or a motion for a more definitive statement  in lieu of an answer.  With respect to the request that the Exec utive Director adopt a rule allowing for the  filing of the specific motions suggested, it is  noted  that, although not specifically pro vided  for,  such matters are already per mitted under the existing procedural rules.  Thus, no modification is necessary.  As to the commenters' other concerns, the  language of section 5.0l(f), as adopted and ap proved, has been clarified  to provide that  only affirmative defenses  that could have  reasonably been anticipated based on  the  facts  alleged  in  the  complaint  shall  be  deemed waived if not raised in an answer. In  addition, the rule has been modified to de scribe  the circumstances under which mo tions for leave to amend an answer to raise  defenses or interpose denials will be granted.  E. Withdrawal of complaints  One commenter argued that the require ment contained in section 5.03 that the with drawal of a complaint be approved by a Hear ing Officer should be deleted because, accord ing to the commenter, under the CAA a com plaint may be withdrawn at any time. In the  commenter's view, a rule requiring Hearing  Officer approval of such a withdrawal is ""an  inappropriate exercise of the Executive Di rector's authority."" This commenter further  took issue with the distinction made in the  rule between approval of the withdrawal of a  complaint by  a  covered employee, which  must always be approved by a Hearing Offi cer, and the withdrawal of a complaint by  the General Counsel, which may occur with out Hearing Officer approval prior  to  the  opening of a hearing.  Contrary to the commenter's assertion, it  is entirely appropriate and, indeed, the norm  in our legal system to require approval of  the withdrawal of an action after formal pro ceedings have been initiated. See, e.g., Fed eral Rule of Civil Procedure 41. Moreover,  the different restrictions placed on covered  employees and the General Counsel are also  appropriate. Under section 220 of the CAA,  and the regulations adopted by the Board  pursuant to section 220(d) to implement sec tion 220, the General Counsel's prosecutorial  discretion has been properly acknowledged  by permitting the General Counsel to with draw a complaint without Hearing Officer  approval prior to the opening of the hearing.  Accordingly, the final rule, as adopted and  approved, has not been modified.  F. Objections not made are deemed waived  Two commenters expressed  the  concern  that proposed section 7.0l(e) could operate to  work a disservice to unrepresented parties or  to preclude Board consideration of appro priate matters on appeal.  The  rule, as adopted and approved, has  been modified. Further, it is noted that a  Hearing Officer  is always free  to consider  issues  about which  objections were not  made.  ",1996
309,,104,-0.383,569,17,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize  the contributions of women  to  the  financial  services industry and to honor an organization  that makes  this success possible: Financial  Women International.  Women have made a major impact  in the  realm of financial services, leading to the in dustry's  growth  and  flourishment.  For 75  years, Financial Women International has ad vanced these goals by helping women in the  financial services industry to expand their per sonal and professional capabilities.  When  the group was  founded  in 1921,  it  claimed 59 members who held high positions  in their banks. Today, Financial Women Inter national counts more  then 10,000 members  from all 50 States and several  foreign coun tries. These individuals come from all facets of  the rapidly expanding world of financial serv ices.  Financial Women  lnternational's impressive  record stems from  its emphasis on education.  The group appreciates the importance of con tinual learning. For this reason, it offers semi nars and many other programs  that  teach  women  in  the  financial services  industry the  skills they need to become and remain com petitive.  In addition, Financial Women  International  advances the interests of working women by  promoting pay equity and through its contribu tions to the efforts of the Glass Ceiling Com mission.  I am pleased  to honor Financial Women  International. I ask my colleagues to join me in  saluting this organization and the many hard working women of the financial services indus try.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CHILD  LABOR FREE CONSUMER  INFOR MATION ACT OF 1996  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 1996  ",1996
310,,104,-0.552,569,17,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to be able to introduce today new legEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  islation  to aid consumers wanting  to avoid  products made with abusive and exploitative  child  labor. The measure, called  the Child  Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1996,  encourages apparel and sporting good compa nies  to voluntarily adopt a ""child  labor free""  label on their products or packaging.  Over 60 Members of the House have joined  me in introducing this important piece of legis lation that I wrote with my good friend Senator  TOM HARKIN of Iowa, who has been a relent less fighter for children and for human rights.  Our bill would create the broadest anti-child  labor label in today's market. It builds on suc cessful efforts to use labels to inform consum ers of socially responsible actions by manufac turers and  retailers. The Rugmark  label,  for  example, guarantees that certain hand-knotted  Asian rugs were not made by exploited chil dren. And the Green Seal and other environ mental labels, such as the Dolphin Sate logo  on cans of tuna  fish and  the European ""E""  label, provide  important  information  to con sumers concerned about environmental pro tection.  On most products today there is a world of  information. You can know if a shirt was made  in  the United States or abroad, made with  union labor, made of cotton or synthetics, and  how to care for it. Nowhere, however, will you  see  reference  to any  labor protections ad hered to in the manufacture. And yet,  this  is  an  important piece of information to consum ers that could influence their purchasing deci sions. It is important to workers, and it is im portant to the children that are being exploited  and abused in the workplace because of insuf ficient pressure on countries and businesses  to put these children in school rather than to  work.  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that consum ers want  to avoid products made  in sweat shops or by child labor, but they have no way  of knowing which products to avoid. Our legis lation asks companies  to  ""put your money  where your mouth is""-if your product is free  of child  labor, tell  the consumer right on  the  label.  Numerous polls and surveys show consum ers want information about socially responsible  business practices. One study, by Marymount  University in Virginia,  found that three out of  four Americans would boycott a store  if they  knew it sold goods made in sweatshops.  Regrettably, products made with abusive  and exploitative child labor and in sweatshops  are prevalent. The International Labor Organi zation estimates  there are several hundred  million children making goods, many of which  are sold in U.S. markets.  Attention to this issue was heightened this  year after it was disclosed at a hearing that I  chaired by the Democratic Policy Committee  that celebrity product lines, such as the Kathie  Lee Gifford clothes sold at Wal-Mart stores,  were made in part by underage youth and at  sweatshops. Life magazine added to the at tention by  later  reporting  that most soccer  balls in the world are made by poor children,  some as young as 5 years old.  Last year,  the United States  imported al most 50 percent of the wearing apparel sold  here and the garment industry netted $34 bil lion. And according to the Department of Com merce,  last year the United States  imported  24099  494.1  million  pairs  of  athletic  footwear enough shoes to encircle the Earth five and a  half  times-and produced only 65.3 million  pairs domestically.  Many companies say  their manufacturing  contracts specifically prohibit the use of child  labor and other labor violations and that they  will  terminate contracts with companies  that  violate those terms. Regrettably, these codes  of conduct are  rarely  independently verified.  In-fact,  the Gifford  line and Wal-Mart both  have codes of conduct against child labor and  sweatshops.  Gifford, who has become an outspoken op ponent of  these  labor violations,  told Good  Housekeeping magazine  this  month  that  codes of conduct are inadequate:  Other celebrities say, ""Oh, I've got some thing in my contract that says this kind of  labor can never be exploited."" I've had the  same clause in my contract since Day One.  It's always been a concern of ours. But how  much good does it do?  The Child Labor Free Consumer Information  Act would establish a commission of govern ment, business, union and non-profit members  working together to create guidelines for the  use of a  ""Child Labor Free"" or ""Not made  With Child Labor'' label. The label could be at tached  to or printed on  the product or the  product packaging. The Commission would  also be charged with investigating complaints  brought to it that a company may be fraudu lently using the label. Even though use of the  label would be voluntary, companies would  face increased penalties under Federal Trade  Commission law for fraudulently using it.  Companies that adopt this label will find that  they will be rewarded  in  the marketplace by  consumers  that  repeatedly state  they don't  want to support labor exploitation, particularly  of small children. This is a socially responsible  and economically attractive step  for compa nies  to  take. We know we cannot  rid child  labor from  the world, but we hope that con sumers will be able  to make an  informed  choice about whether  they want  to support  products made with child labor or not.  I recognize that it  is  late  in  the  legislative  session to be introducing new legislation. And  I expect  to  reintroduce  this  legislation again  next year. But  I believe it is  important to re mind  the public and my colleagues that this  issue will not simply fade away. And this legis lation also contains an  idea that businesses  could act on today, without its passage, if they  were so inclined.  I hope they will consider a  label seriously as a means to prove to con sumers  their commitment  to stopping child  labor violations.  Finally, Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to attach  to this statement a report that I have prepared  based on the information gathered at the April  hearing and on subsequent investigations by  my staff. The report makes a compelling argu ment for the use of voluntary product labels to  achieve socially-and economically-desirable  goals.  THE NEED FOR BE'ITER PRODUCT LABELING  INTRODUCTION  Although  the  rapidly  expanding  global  marketplace has brought to U.S. consumers  an  ever-broadening  array  of goods  from  around  the world,  the market  has  not  brought additional information to consumers  ",1996

The Administration  strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 1350  without amendment when the Senate votes  on this bill on September 24, 1996. Early en actment of this legislation is important to  national security. The Administration takes  no position on the merits of these amend ments at this time.

314,House,104,0.336,816,17,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise in  support of H.R. 1720, the Government-spon sored Enterprise Privatization Act. of 1996.  This legislation will privatize two Government sponsored enterprises, the Student Loan Mar keting Association ""Sallie Mae"" and the Col lege Construction Loan  Insurance Association  ""Connie Lee"".  In addition,  it provides for the  elimination of more  than 40 unfunded pro grams found in the Higher Education Act., con solidates and  improves Federal  library and  museum programs, and provides extensions  for the National Literacy Act,  the Adult Edu cation and Literacy Act., and the Carl D. Per kins Vocational and Applied Technology Act..  Sallie Mae and Connie Lee are both Gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises  chartered  under the Higher Education Act.. Both are for profit,  stockholder owned  companies which  have successfully  fulfilled  their intended pur poses. After more than a year of discussions  with the Treasury Department with respect to  privatization,  I am happy  to support this bill  that paves the way for a smooth transition to  private sect.or status which works  for Sallie  Mae, Connie Lee, and  the Federal Govern ment.  The bill before us also extends  the Adult  Education Act for 1 year and although it does  not make major improvements to the act, we  have  included one  important change. H.R.  1720 clarifies that funds under the Adult Edu cation Act may be used for family literacy pro grams.  If we are going  to effectively  reduce  the  number of adults who are illiterate, we must  work with families. Children with parents who  can help them with their school work have a  greater  likelihood of succeeding  in  school.  Family  literacy programs provide adults with  the education and parenting skills necessary  to help their children succeed in school. At the  same time, they work with children to improve  their academic skills. While some States do  use their adult education  funds for family  lit eracy programs, it is important that we amend  current law to clarify that this is an allowable  use of funds.  Finally,  this  legislation extends  the author ization  for  the National  Institute  for Literacy  and revises current law to allow the Institute to  more effectively assist with national efforts to  improve the literacy level of our country's citi zens.  My one regret about H.R. 1720,  is  that it  represents only a small fraction of the reform  in the area of job training and education that  I have pushed  for during this Congress. My  ",1996
315,House,104,0.453,829,17,Mr. MICA.," Madam Speaker, I  thank  the  gentleman  from California  for  yielding me time. I want to also recog nize the gentleman's outstanding lead ership and hard work on this piece of  legislation. He,  as  chairman of  the  House Subcommittee on Government  Management,  Information, and Tech nology, and his able staff have worked  diligently to craft, working with the  minority,  a  bill which  I  think  the  House can be very proud of.  I would also like to take this oppor tunity to  thank  the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, Chairman CLINGER,  of  the Committee on Government Reform  and Oversight,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania, Chairman GOODLING, of  the Committee on Economic and Edu cational Opportunities, the gentleman  from Illinois, Chairman HYDE, of the  Committee on Judiciary, and the dis tinguished gentleman from Connecti cut, Mr.  SHAYS,  and  the gentleman  from New Hampshire, Mr. BASS,  for  their leadership on this measure. Each  of them has in fact made  invaluable  contributions to this legislation.  I also want to take just a moment  and pay particular  thanks and com mendation  to  the gentlewoman from  New York [Mrs. MALONEY] for her hard  work and her leadership as the ranking  member. I know the gentlewoman has  a  few problems with  the bill, but I  think they can be worked out. Without  her leadership, the bill would not be on  the floor today.  Mr. Speaker,  I  introduced  this bill  because, like many Americans, I have  really  become  concerned  about  the  White House, which in fact even  the  casual observer today would find  the  White House lacks accountability and  operates without  responsibilities  to  laws that apply to the rest of us.  One of the things we did and I did as  a member of the new majority was to  make  this Congress  live  under  the  same laws as everyone else. Th.is legis lation in fact extends that same re quirement to our highest office in the  land, and should do so.  This bill addresses three major areas  of concern. The first concern is that  the Executive Office of the President is  I  not subject to the same employment  laws that cover business, private busi ness and the Congress.  Second, it would create a chief finan cial officer and also an inspector gen eral to improve financial management  and responsibility at the White House.  Third, it would clarify the definition,  as you have heard from the gentleman  from California, of special government  employees with respect to presidential  advisors.  This Congress  again  took historic  steps in its first 100 days when it made  itself live under  the same  laws  that  have been  imposed under the private  sector. Now it is  time  to really just  close  that  loop and put  the White  House under these same laws. It is time  to end what  have called ""the last  plantation,"" where wages and working  conditions of many of the employees  remain unaffected by Federal employ ment laws.  When this is done, I think the politi cal components of Government and the  White House will be required to wrestle  with the same knotty problems that  private citizens and private business  face every day. The President and the  White House will face compliance with  the same laws and edicts imposed on  all Americans.  Let me turn now, Mr. Speaker, to the  second objective of this bill,  the im provement of the management of the  financial  operations  at  the White  House. Through  the hearing process  during the past year we have observed  that the White House financial oper ations in fact lack both accountability  and structure. The Travelgate hearings  highlighted some of the shortcomings  in White House financial  responsibil ity.  Mr. Speaker, had there been a chief  financial officer at  the White House  back then, he or she who was in charge  would have reviewed the White House  travel financial management practices  and said ""Wow."" They would have said,  ""Wait, let's look at this."" The chief fi nancial officer would have in fact de tected  any  discrepancies  and  could  have helped the Travel Office managers  correct them.  The Congress  failed  the American  people by not having adequate finan cial structures or safeguards in place.  In fact, we must take part of that re sponsibility as. overseers. White House  employees were used, unfortunately, as  scapegoats, because we failed to have  reliable management or financial ac countability in our Chief Executive Of fice of the land.  Likewise, Madam Speaker, hearings  conducted by our Subcommittee on Na tional Security, International Affairs,  and Criminal Justice also reveal very  serious deficiencies  in oversight and  accountability  at  the White House  Communications Agency. I sit on that  subcommittee. I was stunned when we  heard the egregious examples of waste  and abuse, all a result of almost a total  lack of controls in this agency, which  is under  the operational control,  in  fact, of  the Executive Office of  the  President.  The accounting controls were so poor  that the agency recently had $14.5 mil lion in unobligated obligations. It has  been paying for equipment and serv ices.  Madam Speaker, now, let me restate  this. The accounting controls were so  poor that the agency recently had $14.5  million in unvalidated obligations. It  has been paying  for  equipment and  services  that are,  in fact, no  longer  necessary. It has been paying for items  that were never delivered to the agen cy, and it has occasionally paid for the  same items twice.  An audit by the Department of De fense's IG also found that the agency  paid only 17 percent of its bills on time,  causing the taxpayers to pay for inter est and penalties on the remaining 83  percent.  We  are  fortunate,  in  fact, Madam  Speaker,  that  the White House does  not have a mortgage, because of the  way it operates. It would have, in fact,  been repossessed by now.  Again, Madam Speaker,  these  are  problems that we believe a chief finan cial officer would have identified and  corrected.  The addition of an inspector general  at  the White House will  also help  eliminate waste,  fraud, and abuse  in  the Executive Office of the President. I  think, in fact, we can all agree that  strong  financial management at  the  White House  is imperative. This bill  will achieve that goal.  The third and final objective is to re quire more public accountability in so called volunteers who advise the Presi dent  in  the Executive Office of  the  President. Once again, Madam Speak er,  the Travelgate hearings have  re vealed why Congress must take these  actions.  The activities only, if we use Harry  Thompson as exhibit A, will  reveal  that this Clinton operative, an unpaid  volunteer, had office accommodations,  roam~d the halls of the White House,  participated in meetings with employ ees of the Executive Office and, in fact,  with  the President, and,  in fact, at tempted  to  influence policy  in some  places with a potential personal con flict of interest. In short, he acted as if  he was a White House employee. Under  this bill, he would have been subject to  conflict-of-interest laws.  Madam Speaker, the Presidential and  Executive Office Accountability Act is  a good bill. It will bring the Executive  Office of the President under the same  employment laws and civil rights laws  that Congress and the private sector  must live under.  ",1996

Mr. Speaker, the Animal Drug Avail ability Act makes important changes  to the process by which the Food and  Drug Administration reviews applica tions for new animal drugs.  We have heard a great deal in this  Congress about reforming Government  and streamlining regulation. This leg islation demonstrates that these goals  can be accomplished if all of the inter ested parties are willing to negotiate.  This amendment to H.R. 2508 is the re sult of compromise between the FDA  and the animal drug coalition. It is bi partisan, and it achieves reforms re sponsibly and carefully.  We are pleased that this legislation  incorporates FDA proposals included in  the Vice President's reinventing Gov ernment initiatives, one that will re duce unnecessary requirements and pa perwork associated with feed mill li censing and another that will authorize  FDA to establish import tolerances for  animal drugs not approved for use in  the United States.  The provisions of this bill complete a  task begun with enactment in 1994 of  the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clari fication Act. When  the House passed  that  important  legislation, we knew  that expanding drug availability would  require addressing the underlying issue  that there are not enough new animal  drugs available  for  veterinarians  to  treat all  the diseases and conditions  that affect animals. That is the issue  dealt with by H.R. 2508.

319,House,104,-0.519,933,17,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  call attention  to the 85th national day of the  founding of the Republic of China. Not only for  its rapid implementation of democratic policies  and reforms but also for its responsiveness to  trade  imbalances between our two countries  should the Republic of China on Taiwan be  honored and congratulated on this historic oc casion.  One proper way to celebrate the Republic of  China's national day is for us to recognize Tai wan's campaign to reenter the United Nations  and other  international organizations. There  really  is no  reason  to deny  the Republic of  China membership  in  the United Nations.  In  my mind, Taiwan's membership in the United  Nations  is  in  total conformity with  the U.N.  principle of universality; will definitely contrib ute to peace and stability in East Asia and will  serve  the  interests  of  the United States.  Today, we have taken a small step in advanc ing  this campaign by  the House adopting  House Concurrent Resolution 212, which sup ports Taiwan's entry into international organi zations.  In commemoration of Taiwan's 85th national  day,  I extend greetings and best wishes  to  President Lee Teng-Hui,  foreign  representa tive, Ambassador Jason Hu.

",1996
321,House,104,0.371,985,17,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of  the conference  report on H.R. 3666,  the  VA/HUD appropriation for 1997.  In particular, as chairman of the Subcommit tee on Health of the Committee on Ways and  Means, I want to point out that two legislative  provisions contained  in the conference report  amend Public Law 104-191, the Health Insur ance  Portability  and Accountability Act  of  1996, which falls within the jurisdiction of the  Committee on Ways and Means. The  rule,  which the House just passed, waives the nec essary points of order allowing the conference  report to be considered with these legislative  items.  First, title VI of the conference report, titled  ""Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection  Act of 1996,"" would introduce new rules which  must be met by group health plans subject to  the requirements of the Health Insurance Port ability and Accountability Act of 1996. These  rules would prevent group health plans from  restricting certain benefits for hospital care in  connection with childbirth.  Second, title VII of the conference report, ti tled ""Parity in the Application of Certain Limits  to Mental Health Benefits,"" would  introduce  new rules which also must be met by group  health plans subject to the requirements of the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act of 1996. These rules estC'blish certain re quirements concerning application of  lifetime  or annual  limits  to mental health benefits,  if  mental health benefits are  the  group health plan.  The conferees have noted  :n  their  report  language that, in order for this provision to be  in~luded in  fully implemented, the Internal Revenue Code  must be appropriately amended. Such amend ments would permit enforcement of these new  requirements through the tax penalty structure  that was recently enacted in the Health Insur ance Portability and Accountability Act applica ble to group health plans. In other words, we  are adding new requirements to only the Pub lic Health Service Act and ERISA-Employee  Retirement and Income Security Act-portions  of the underlying law without being able at this  time,  to make  the necessary conforming re quirements to the Internal Revenue Code due  to procedural constraints on  this appropria tions bill. It is our intention on the Committee  on Ways and Means to move the conforming  tax provisions as soon as possible.  It is also important to note thatthe maternal  stay provision has been scored as having a  negative income and payroll tax revenue effect  of $112 million over  the period 1997-2002.  The mental health parity provision has a nega tive  revenue effect of $431 million over the  same period. These revenue losses are clear ly a matter of concern and  responsibility  for  the committee with jurisdiction over tax mat ters.  The legislative language needed to accom plish full  implementation of the maternal stay  and mental health provisions in the framework  of the underlying Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act,  is reflected in the text  of H.R. 4135, introduced today by myself and  Mr. STARK, the ranking minority member of the  Subcommittee on Health. We are entering the  text  of H.R.  4135  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD to indicate the changes the Commit tee on Ways and Means intends to pursue.  Finally, we have exchanged  letters regard ing these jurisdictional matters with the chair man of the Committee on Appropriations and  I understand that these  letters will be placed  in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  H.R. 4135  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

322,,104,0.585,1076,17,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  would like to recognize one of the best men I  have had the privilege to know. His life reflects  his  life's work: Preaching  the message of  Jesus. Dr. Russell F. Blowers has served his  congregation at East  91 st Street Christian  Church in  Indianapolis for 45 years. As Russ  retires  I am filled with mixed emotions. While  I am happy that he will be able to have time  for new ventures, he will be sorely missed in  the weeks, months, and years to come.  Under his committed  leadership, Dr. Blow ers has seen church membership grow from  85 people on his first Sunday, to nearly 4,000,  making  it one of  Indiana's  largest congrega tions. East 91st Street Church has provided a  myriad of ways for its members to serve, grow  spiritually, and evangelize. Russ attributes this  amazing growth to having stayed true to the  Christian scriptures. By God's grace, Russ has  remained  faithful  to  the gospel by preaching  the lordship of Jesus Christ, the power of the  Holy Spirit,  the essential plan of salvation  through  the Cross and  resurrection, and  the  inerrant nature of the divinely inspired Word of  God.  Russ Blowers has preached about  issues  that transcend politics and  reflect unchange able Biblical  truths,  such  as  opposition  to  abortion and  that homosexuality  is against  God's will. Russ has counseled Senator RICH ARD  LUGAR,  former  Vice  President  Dan  Quayle, Representative ANDY  JACOBS,  and  myself, a member of the church since 1981.  ANDY JACOBS has said, ""I think Russ's legacy  will be that he showed us all the potential of  the human heart. He showed us what a con siderable contribution one person can make  by simply seeking to love and be loved in re turn.""  I wholeheartedly agree with my  col league. Russ Blowers has lived out the words  he has preached. He is Christ-like.  Russ was born in Zanesville, OH,  in 1924.  He  is a World War II veteran, having served  with the 343d Fighter Squadron, 55th Fighter  Group of  the 8th Air Force  in England and  Germany. After his  return  from  the 8th Air  Force, Russ entered Ohio University as a jour nalism-advertising major and met his  future  wife, Marian. She  introduced Russ  to Chris tianity. ""She didn't beat me over the head with  the Bible."" he says. ""She just lived the life and  answered my dumb questions about the Bible.  I fell  in  love with her first and then with my  Lord.""  After graduation from Ohio University, Russ  received a Master of Divinity  from Christian  Theological Seminary and Milligan College  later conferred on him with the Doctor of Divinity. Dr. Russ Blowers became pastor of  East 49th Street Christian Church in 1951. As  the church grew, the congregation changed its  name when it moved to 6049 East 91 st Street.  Russ Blowers preached his  final sermon on  September 8, 1996. He sums up his ministry  by reflecting, ""Above all, as I close this phase  of my ministry, I give God the glory for what ever has been accomplished. He has been  faithful  to me beyond my deserving, and my  most precious honor is being one of His chil dren, one of His servants.""  Russ has also been involved in ministry be yond his local congregation. He has preached  in 11 nations and has hosted nine tour groups  to Europe and  the Middle East. He hosted  ""The Chapel Door"" live on WISH-TV daily for  12 years. Russ has also been a contributing  columnist for ""The Lookout Magazine"" as well  as the church's newsletter ""The 91 st Edition.""  Russ and Marian have  two sons: Philip,  Marion County deputy prosecuting attorney;  and Paul, associate professor of church his tory at Emmanuel School of Religion. Their  accomplished sons will confirm that this Pastor  who  loved  the  congregation  of East  91 st  Street  is  the same genuine article at home  with his family as he is in the pulpit. The Blow ers also have  four grandchildren: Shannon,  Alison, Leslie, and Colin.  Russ has not only been a great pastor, he  has also been my good friend and confidant  through the years. May  the Lord continue to  bless Russ and Marian very generously in the  years to come, in the way that they have been  a blessing to others.  ST. BONIFACE CHURCH  CELEBRATESlOOTHANNIVERSARY  HON. PAUL E. KANJORSKI  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 24, 1996  ",1996
323,,104,-0.303,1076,17,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to bring to the attention of my colleagues, the  1 OOth anniversary of St. Boniface Church  in  Wilkes-Barre, PA.  I am pleased to have been  asked to participate in the observance of this  milestone.  On August 16, 1896 a group of German im migrants from the Pfalz region of Bavaria met  to  form a new congregation. An executive  committee of 12 was formed to obtain permis sion  from  the bishop to build a new church.  When permission was granted a lot was pur chased on Blackman Street  in Wilkes-Barre.  Five men mortgaged their homes to provide  the initial money to build the church. On Octo ber 4, 1896 the cornerstone of the church was  laid by Bishop O'Hara. The original construc tion cost of the church was $4,345.  On the suggestion of Bishop O'Hara and re flecting the German heritage of the majority of  the parishioners, the church was named after  St. Boniface, the apostle of the Germans as  the church's patron saint.  The  first mass was held  in March 1897 in  the newly built church which still didn't have  pews. The dedication of the church  followed  shortly after that. The first pastor of the church  was  the Reverend Charles J. Goeckel who  lived with neighbors until a rectory could be  built at the church.  The church began a series of fundraising  activities and parish socials in order to raise  money for construction of facilities and to pro vide community services for the parishioners.  The traditional St. Boniface ""Kaffee Klatsch"" is  still held today on Shrove Tuesday night as a  way for members of the parish to get together.  Under  the  leadership  of  the  Reverend  Charles Von Weldon, the parish and commu nity offerings of St. Boniface grew and the ad joining convent was enlarged.  Mr. Speaker, every succeeding pastor of St.  Boniface helped  to expand and enlarge  the  property and make  the parish prosper. The  church today is an  important presence in the  religious  life of the Wyoming Valley. Serving  German immigrants and others for 100 years,  St. Boniface has continued the traditions and  preserved the heritage of its founders.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to congratulate St.  Boniface on  this milestone  in  its history and  send best wishes for continued prosperity.  THE PASSING OF EVELYN DAVIS  HON. BENJAMIN A.

Evelyn Burtz Davis, a resident of Old Tap pan, NJ, was  the publisher of the Rockland  County Times, located in Haverstraw, NY. Re cently,  she became publisher also  of  the  Rockland Review, also published in Rockland  County, NY.  In her role as publisher of the Times since  1984, she became known for the caustic com ments and unique insight of her editorials. Al though she quite often advocated stands on  issues with which on occasion  I was  in total  disagreement, no one could ever question the  extensive research which Evelyn undertook on  each and every editorial she composed. While  many of us may have often questioned her  conclusions, no one ever questioned the fac tual validity of the data which led her to make  these conclusions. No one ever questioned  the intellectual integrity for which Evelyn Davis  became a living legend in our community.  Perhaps most significantly of all, no matter  how deeply Evelyn may have disagreed with a  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

326,,104,0.29,1089,17,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, today,  I introduced legislation along with Representa tive  MENENDEZ  to  encourage  America's  schools to teach our young students about a  tragic period  in history that nearly destroyed  the people and country of Ireland and forever  changed the face of America.  The mass starvation in Ireland from 1845 to  1850  initiated by  the dramatic  failure of  the  Irish potato crop is most commonly referred to  as the Irish Potato Famine. Although Europe's  poorest country  in  the middle 19th century,  Ireland's 8 million  inhabitants were curiously  well-nourished. The Irish people relied on the  potato for the bulk of their diet since it was in expensive and high  in nutrients. However, in  1845, the Irish potato crop was ruined across  the  entire  countryside  by  phytophthora  infestans, an airborne petilence. At the time,  no one knew what caused  the potato blight  and so little could be done to save the crops.  Across the whole of Ireland, potatoes simply  rotted on the ground.  The failure of the potato crop led to the in ability of most Irish families to pay the rent on  their cottages which, after Britain's annexation  of the  island  in  the  late 18th century, were  ",1996
327,Senate,104,-0.342,1115,17,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, I want  to thank the subcommittee for its hard  and diligent work on this bill. In par ticular,  I appreciate  the earmark of  $500,000  for  the Coordinated Tribal  Water Quality Program for fiscal year  1997.  This program began in 1990 when the  26  tribes and  tribal organizations  in  Washington State came together with  a cooperative intergovernmental strat egy to accomplish national clean water  goals. As a result of Federal court decisions, the State of Washington has rec ognized  the  tribes as comanagers of  water quality in the State. This pro gram has been an effective  tool  for  leveraging scarce public funds  to cre ate viable, watershed-based water qual ity protection plans.  It  is my  understanding  that  the  $500,000 earmark in the committee re port is not intended to preclude the Co ordinated Tribal Water Quality Pro gram from receiving the needed addi tional $2 million  from  the Environ mental Protection Agency's existing  funds under section 104(b )3 of the Clean  Water Act.  ",1996
328,House,104,-0.509,1232,17,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, it is not  often that I have occasion to rise and  commend  the Federal Reserve Board,  but the decision yesterday to hold the  line on interest rates certainly merits  commendation.  We  all know  the Federal Reserve  Board  is  allergic  to  good  economic  news. If too many Americans find jobs,  the Fed ominously warns of runaway  inflation when there is no evidence of  inflation, and cranks up interest rates  to slow  the economy down. The Fed  has seemed determined to maintain an  unemployment rate,  to guarantee an  unemployment rate of at least 5.6 per cent or more. To keep this in perspec tive, every percentage point of unem ployment represents 1.3 million Ameri cans.  That should be a cause for concern to  anyone in this Chamber who has been  conscientiously cutting the deficit or  scrapping the Nation's social safety net  in  the belief  that  their efforts will  lower interest rates and put people to  work.  So my congratulations to the Federal  Reserve  for  enduring  the  economic  good news with  restraint. Hopefully  this is a sign that in the future we may  be able to begin to count on the Fed to  help, not hinder, the effort to improve  the lives of all Americans.  And as a  consequence of this, Mr.  Speaker, I again ask and I join my col leagues in asking that the Ethics Com mittee stop covering up and release the  Gingrich report.

331,House,104,0.332,1336,17,Mr. FAWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding this time to  me.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that I rise  in support of the Child Abuse Preven tion  and  Treatment Act  [CAPTAJ  Amendments of 1996. Since its passage  in 1974, CAPTA has provided protection  and assistance for one of our nation's  most  vulnerable  segments-children  who have been abused and/or neglected.  I am delighted to say that this is yet  another bipartisan measure produced  by the House Opportunities Committee  and brought to the floor under suspen sion of the rules. I commend Chairman  GOODLING  and  ranking member, Mr.  CLAY and Mr. KILDEE for their fine ef fort in bringing this important legisla tion to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, for a number of years, I  have -sponsored  the  ""At-Birth Aban doned Baby Act"". The bill guarantees  all babies abandoned at-birth, or short ly thereafter,  the right to immediate  placement  and  bonding  with  ''preadoptive  parents.''  The  preadoptive parents are given the right  to immediately initiate proceedings for  an expeditious adoption of the aban doned baby.  One of the major provisions of the  At-Birth Abandoned Baby Act simply  requires State welfare authorities  to  immediately place ""at-birth abandoned  babies""  with . suitable  ""pre-adoptive  parents"" who, in turn, will be allowed  to immediately file for an expeditious  adoption of the abandoned baby in the  State court of proper jurisdiction.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Child  Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  contains similar provisions which will  provide for an expedited adoption pro cedure for abandoned infants. The bill  requires that in order to be eligible to  receive  funds under  the Child Abuse  Prevention and Treatment Act, States  must have in place a program within 2  years which will provide ""for the expe dited termination of parental rights in  the case of any infant determined to be  abandoned  under  State  law"". Mr.  Speaker, I strongly support the inclu sion of this provision in the bill.  I would also like to mention that the  bill contains a provision which will re quire  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services,  in dispensing  funds  under  the Abandoned  Infants Assist ance Act,  to give priority  to States  which have developed and implemented  procedures for expedited placement of  abandoned infants. I believe this provi sion will give States the added incen tive to implement this vital expedited  adoption procedure.

335,,104,0.418,1427,17,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to  inform my  colleagues  about  National  Dystonia Awareness Week, September 28 to  October 5, 1996.  I was privileged, Mr. Speaker,  to attend a  chili supper in June given by a group of resi dents of  the Second District who deal with  dystonia everyday. These residents  regularly  meet and discuss  the challenges  they meet  everyday.  Dystonia is a relatively rare neurological dis order characterized by severe muscle contrac tions and sustained postures  that afflicts an  estimated 300,000 people  in North America.  Dystonia is a complex disorder that consist of  three types and  is often times misunderstood  and misdiagnosed.  The  three  types of dystonia are primary,  focal dystonias, and secondary dystonia.  Primary  dystonia  or  idiopathic  torsion  dystonia  [ITD],  causes  spasms  that affect  many different parts of  the body and often  starts in childhood.  Focal dystonias affects one specific part of  the body and is distinguished for five varieties.  Blespharasposm causes eyelids to else tightly  for seconds to hours. Cervical dystonia is the  contraction on neck muscles turning the head  to one side or pulling it forward or backward.  Oromandibular dystonia-Meige's Syndrome is  a  combination  of  blepharospasm  and  oromandibular dystonia in which the muscles  of the lower face pull or contract irregularly to  cause facial distortions. Spasmodic dysphonia  affects  the  speech muscles of  the  throat,  causing strained,  forced, or breathy speech.  Writer's cramp is characterized by muscles in  the hand and forearm contracting.  The  last  type  of  dystonia,  secondary  dystonia, is caused by an injury or other brain  illness.  Unfortunately, there  cure for dystonia.  Researchers, however, have made promis ing advancements  in understanding this dis order.  In 1989, Ors. Xandra Breakefield and  James Gusella made the discovery of a ge netic marker that will significantly advance fuis no known cause or  24957  ture  research.  In  addition,  hundreds  of  dystonia patients and their families have made  the commitment to donate their brains to fur ther dystonia research.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for al lowing me  this opportunity  to  familiarize my  colleagues with dystonia and encourage each  of my colleagues to learn more about this neu rological disorder.  More  information about dystonia can  be  found on  the world wide web. The Dystonia  Medical Research Foundation's home page  not only offers information about dystonia, but  also details meeting places and  dates  for  those who are or have a family member af t ected by dystonia and can be  reached at  hhtp://www.iii.net/biz/dystonia/. You  can also  learn more by visiting an  internet newsgroup  dedicated to dystonia at ""aft.support.dystonia.""  HONORING THE COMMUNITY OF  HIGHLANDS, TX  HON.
