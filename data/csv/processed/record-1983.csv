0,Senate,98,0.391,41,3,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  to  introduce a bill which  would amend  title 38 of  the United  States Code to authorize eligible veter ans  to  receive  reimbursement  for  chiropractic services  received  in cer tain circumstances through the Veter ans' Administration medical care pro gram.  Under current law, the VA has the  authority to provide chiropractic serv ices to veterans and any VA physician  may, on a case-by-case basis, refer an  eligible veteran to a chiropractor for  treatment.  Despite  this  authority,  only a few, if any, veterans have ever  been ref erred by VA physicians to a  chiropractor at VA expense.  Mr. President, I believe our Nation's  veterans deserve  the same access  to  medical  treatment,  including  chiro practic treatment, as do recipients of  other Federal and State health care  programs, many of which now provide  chiropractic treatment to their benefi ciaries. It is time that the V A's policy  and practice be brought more in line  with  these programs. For  instance,  under the medicare program which is  administered by  the Department of  Health and Human Services, it is typi cal  for  eligible persons  in need of  chiropractic care  to seek and obtain  the services of a doctor of chiropractic  and to receive reimbursement for such  services  from HHS. Reimbursement  for chiropractic services  is also cur rently provided under the Federal Em ployees  Compensation Act  and  a  number of States include chiropractic  services under their medical assistance  programs.  Mr. President, the legislation which  I propose today is nearly identical to  S. 1956, a bill which I introduced and  which was  passed  by  the  Senate  during the 97th Congress. It will es tablish a pilot program to compel the  use of chiropractors within the VA. It  limits the number of veterans who are  eligible for its benefits and also limits  total  expenditures  for  chiropractic  services under the pilot program to $2  million in any fiscal year. Unless ex tended, the program as proposed will  expire on September 30, 1986.  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me  say that while the House has, on two  occasions, rejected this Senate-passed  pilot program, it has joined the Senate  in strongly urging  the V A's Depart ment of Medicine and Surgery to re evaluate its position and to use its ex isting authorities to provide, at least  on a pilot basis, chiropractic services  in appropriate cases as part of the hos pital  care  or medical  services  fur nished to veterans. This message was  ignored by the VA. I, therefore, urge  Congress to send a stronger message  to the VA on this matter by favorably  considering this bill.  Mr. President, I send the bill to the  desk and ask that it be referred to the  appropriate  committee  for  prompt  consideration, and  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  it be printed  in  the  RECORD at the conclusion of my  re marks.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.567  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That <a>  section 601 of title 38, United States Code, is  amended by adding at the end thereof the  following new paragraph:  ""(9)  The  term  'chiropractic  services'  means  the manual manipulation of  the  spine performed by a chiropractor <who is  licensed as such by the State in which he or  she performs such services and who meets  the uniform minimum standards promulgat ed for chiropractors under section 1861<r)(5)  of  the  Social  Security Act  <42  U.S.C.  1395x(r)(5))) to correct a subluxation of the  spine. For the purposes of this paragraph,  such term does not include physical exami nations, laboratory tests, radiologic services,  or other tests or services determined by the  Administrator to be excluded."".

1,Senate,98,0.631,80,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr.  President,  I  wonder if Senators noted an article in  the August issue of Reader's Digest,  entitled, ""Sign Up-Or Else!""  The article describes a situation in  which New York union officials used  violence and coercion in a campaign of  terror to force a successful electronics  company into bankruptcy.  The owner and employees of  the  company would have been unable to  resist this terror in the courts if not  for  a  charitable  legal  organization  based in Springfield, Va.  I applaud the noble efforts on behalf  of  the workers  taken up by Steve  Antosh and the Center on National  Labor Policy, an outstanding charita ble legal foundation located in Spring field, Va.  The  Elector-Harmonix  case  is  a  grim, forceful reminder to us all. Only  when union officials are held responsi ble for their acts of intimidation and  violence can workers truly enjoy the  freedom  to  pursue  the American  dream.  Mr. President, I ask that the article  be printed in the RECORD.  ""SIGN UP-OR ELSE!""  <By Randy Fitzgerald)  With $1000 he had saved as an electrical  engineer, 26-year-old Mike Matthews found ed Electro-Harmonix, Inc., in 1968. The firm  designed and manufactured electronic musi cal instruments and accessories. First-year  sales amounted  to only $50,000, but  ten  years  later  they had reached $5 million.  Electro employed 150 persons, nearly all of  them black, Hispanic or Asian.  Mike Matthews was a fair-minded employ er who cared  for his workers. Although  most of them began on an assembly line at  the minimum wage, they had unlimited op portunities to advance. For example, Willie  Magee, a 38-year-old black, worked his way  up from unskilled laborer to vice president  of sales at an annual salary of $51,000. And  Manny Zapata, a Spanish immigrant who  spoke no English when he arrived at the  company, became director of foreign mar keting.  All the technicians who worked with the  oscilloscopes,  voltmeters  and  generators  that  tested Electro's complex  electronic  products had started out with the company  as  unskilled  laborers. Dozens  of  others  moved up to bookkeeping and office posi tions while receiving on-the-job training.  Matthews  created  an  environment  in  which  unskilled  people  could  become  skilled, productive citizens. His philosophy:  workers  should advance by merit  rather  than by seniority. In 1978 Matthews was  named New York State Small Business  Person of the Year.  The award apparently attracted the atten tion of the Plastic, Moulders' and Novelty  Workers' Union, Local 132 of the Interna tional Ladies' Garment Workers' Union  CILGWU). Within weeks, a union official  called and said he wanted Matthews to in stall a union shop  in which all workers  would have to join the ILGWU. ""It won't  cost you a dime,"" Matthews was  told. ""In  fact, you can save money.""  Matthews rejected the overture. To per suade  employees  to  sign  ILGWU  cards,  union organizers stationed themselves out side  the company's small  loft factory on  New York City's West 23rd Street. They  made little headway. After a few weeks the  organizers withdrew in defeat, claiming that  Matthews had frightened his workers into  opposing the union.  Actually,  the organizers  failed  because  Matthews had a  remarkable rapport with  his employees. Everyone addressed him by  his first name, cracking jokes and kidding  him as he walked through the factory. Mat thews organized parties and outings for his  workers. On two occasions he closed down  the  factory,  rented buses  and  took  the  entire work  force  to Long  Island  for  a  picnic. He provided his employees with med ical benefits and paid vacations. They recip rocated with affection and loyalty.  Three years after the first organizing at tempt,  the union  returned. Alleging  that  Matthews was abusing  the exploiting mi norities, organizers distributed union cards  to the Electro employees. To call a repre sentative election, signatures were needed  from at  least 30  percent of Matthews's  workers. After a week, fewer than a dozen  cards had been returned. Once again the  union faced an embarrassing rejection.  On Monday, August 10, 1981, a  raucous  crowd of about 50 people assembled in front  of Electro. As Matthews approached  the  building's entrance, he was accosted by five  toughs. One slugged him in the face, an other two pulled at him from behind, while  two  others  kicked  him.  As  employees  emerged from the subways in the morning,  they were confronted and offered money for  lunch, and then asked to sign union cards. If  they refused, they were pelted with eggs or  threatened with fists and clubs. Pho Kham,  a 20-year-old Laotian refugee who had es caped communist  tyranny a year earlier,  was warned, ""Sign up or you'll go to a hospi tal!"" Ecuador-born Fausto Quevedo, 48, was  told by an organizer that if he did not sup port the union, he would be shot in the legs.  Employees trying to enter the building had  to run a gauntlet of shoving, kicking, punch ing and screaming organizers the union had  sent in. Even though police arrived to set up  barricades, only about 20 of Matthews's employees were able to get inside. Production  came to virtual standstill.  For the rest of the week employees were  threathened and taunted as they tried to  report  for work. On his way home one  evening Steve Griffin, 25, was ambushed by  four union thugs and struck over the head  with a bottle. On another night union van dals crept into the building and poured glue  into door and elevator locks.  The following week the union's campaign  of terror resumed in full force. When he left  work at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, August 18, cus tomer-service  representative Geoff Becker  was accosted by several union goons. One of  them slammed a fist into the side of Beck er's face, knocking him unconscious. For six  weeks after the attack Becker experienced  horrible headaches, until a brain operation,  to remove a blood clot caused by the blow,  relieved the pressure inside his head.  By Wednesday Electro's labor force had  been reduced  to a handful of frightened,  angry workers. Since police were unable to  assure Matthews that his workers could be  protected beyond  the plant entrance, he  closed the company and sent his employees  home.  On Thursday morning, after a TV report  the previous evening had shown union orga nizers  involved  in violent acts, police as signed additional officers to the area. The  next day Matthews and about 60 of his em ployees  assembled  at  the Fifth Avenue  subway entrance and marched to Electro in  open defiance of the pickets. They were now  more determined than ever to survive the  union campaign of terror.  Over this period of picketing and harass ment, Matthews and his work  force had  maintained high morale in the face of accu mulating financial problems heightened by  the union's disruptive  tactics. And  then,  convinced  that Electro could not survive,  the Philadelphia  lender  that had backed  Matthews withdrew  its funding.  It was a  savage blow. Faced with a  credit cutoff,  Matthews searched desperately for other fi nancial backing. He did not find it.  On August 25,  just as suddenly as they  had appeared,  the union organizers were  gone, ending three weeks of abuse and hoo liganism. But not before seven of them had  been arrested on charges including assault,  disorderly conduct and harassment. <The  charges  have  since  been  dismissed.)  seemed to Matthews that the union had in tentionally set out  to bankrupt him and  make unemployment statistics of his work ers.  For the next five months Matthews and  about 40 employees hung on valiantly in an  effort to save the company and their jobs.  Even when he fell  four weeks behind on  their wages, his employees kept reporting  for work, determined to stand by Matthews  in his hour of need.  On January 18, 1982, the National Labor  Relations Board ordered the union to ""cease  and desist"" from threatening employees of  Electro-Harmonix, inflicting physical harm  upon them, or giving them money in return  for their signatures on union cards.  But this condemnation of union violence  and coercion was too little and too late to  help Mike Matthews and his employees.  Electro-Harmonix had been without phone  service or electricity for over three months,  the workers toiling by candlelight. The em ployees, like Mike Matthews himself, were  broke.  A week after the board's ruling, Matthews  held a tearful farewell party with his emIt  ",1983

4,,98,-0.35,145,3,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my  colleagues an article from the Wash ington Post on February 20, which  marks  the beginning of an era  in  which nuclear war becomes even more  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  likely. India, the article explains, has  become the first developing country to  begin accumulating sizable stockpiles  of separated plutionium, and doing so  at a rate that would enable it to build  about 20 atomic bombs a year! The sig nificance of this much dreaded event  must not escape us.  I hope that my colleagues will give  some thought to this development and  to the horrors which could ensue. We  must realize that now the importance  of making substantial progress in the  arms reduction talks with the Soviet  Union increases greatly. For only if we  show our commitment in this arena  can we be respected and serve as an  example when we push other nations  in the same direction. I urge my col leagues to take the time to read the  article which follows.  INDIA STORING ARMS-GRADE PLUTONIUM  <By Milton R. Benjamin)  India has become  the  first  developing  country to begin stockpiling separated plu tonium at a  rate that would enable it to  build about 20 atomic bombs a year if it de cides to pursue a nuclear weapons program,  according to U.S. and international sources.  The process of separating the plutonium  from burned-up  fuel produced by  Indian  atomic power plants is taking place at the  Tarapur reprocessing facility near Bombay,  which went into large-scale operation last  November, according  to  the International  Atomic Energy Agency <IAEA>.  Previously, the plant only had been used  to  reprocess small amounts of spent fuel  from research reactors.  According to IAEA officials, the separated  plutonium is being kept in a storage room  there where it will be held until Indian offi cials decide its use. Indian atomic energy of ficials  said yesterday  that  the plutonium  might fuel an experimental fast-breeder re actor, which itself would produce additional  plutonium.  The significance of large-scale reprocess ing in India, however, is that it marks the  beginning of the era that has long worried  nuclear nonproliferation experts-the time  when nations without nuclear arsenals start  accumulating sizable stockpiles of separated  plutonium.  ""There simply is no reason connected to  their civilian power programs why any of  these countries need  to begin stockpiling  separated plutonium in this decade,"" a U.S.  government official said. ""It makes no sense  in an atomic power context at all."" Until  now, virtually all of the plutonium produced  in atomic power plants in developing coun tries has remained part of the highly radio active spent fuel.  The plutonium  stored  in  this way  in  spent-fuel pools in several dozen countries is  not easily accessible.  If a nation decided to use such plutonium  to build nuclear weapons, it first would have  to construct a  reprocessing plant, which  would take at least two years.  But is a country has a stockpile of sepa rated plutonium,  the  temptation  to build  nuclear weapons in a time of crisis might in crease greatly. A country that already had  done weapons-design work might be able to  fabricate separated plutonium into bombs in  a matter of weeks, or perhaps days.  The fact that India is beginning to stock pile large amounts of separated plutonium  is certain to increase apprehension in neigh2869  boring Pakistan, where U.S. analysts believe  the government is attempting to develop a  nuclear weapons capability.  India has stated that it does not plan to  build nuclear weapons.  But the atomic device exploded by India  in 1974 was made from plutonium. So if New  Delhi decided in response to developments  in Pakistan or  for other reasons  that  it  needed  a nuclear arsenal,  it presumably  could turn a stockpile of separated plutoni um into weapons in a relatively short time.  The spent fuel being run through the Tar apur reprocessing plant, located about half  a mile from the U.S.-built Tarapur atomic  power  station,  is  from  the Canadian-de signed Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant l, ac cording to IAEA officials.  At  the moment,  two agency  inspectors  with a mandate to keep track of the plutoni um and sound a warning if any is diverted  for military use are observing  the entire  Tarapur reprocessing operation.  But agency inspectors will not be permit ted to observe all of Tarapur's reprocessing  runs in the months ahead, since India re fuses to place the plant under full interna tional safeguards. Only plutonium subject  international  control  because  of  specific  agreements between India and foreign gov ernments will be monitored.  The IAEA also has not decided whether to  keep the separated plutonium for which it is  responsible under ""continuous inspection,""  or simply  to check on  it ""perhaps every  second week,"" officials said.  The Tarapur facility is designed to reproc ess 100 tons of spent fuel annually, so if it  operated at full capacity-highly unlikely  since commercial  reprocessing plants  fre quently encounter problems-it would be  able to separate 135 to 150 kilograms of plu tonium per year. <A kilogram equals 2.2  pounds.) Six  to 8 kilograms of plutonium  are needed for a nuclear weapon.  The ability to separate plutonium on this  large a scale puts India far ahead of Paki stan, which has built but not yet begun to  operate a much smaller reprocessing plant  next to the Pakistan Institute for Nuclear  Science and Technology on the outskirts of  Islamabad.  It also puts India well ahead of countries  such as Argentina and Brazil, which have  laboratory-scale  reprocessing  facilities  where years might be required to separate  enough  plutonium  for  a  single  nuclear  weapon.  But Pakistan is trying to complete a re processing plant even larger than Tarapur  from a French design; Argentina is building  a  reprocessing facility  that could produce  significant  quantities  of  plutonium,  and  West Germany  is helping Brazil design a  plant.  The only non-nuclear weapons country  other than India operating a commercial size reprocessing plant and stockpiling large  quantities of separated plutonium is Japan,  which has a larger and far more advanced  civilian atomic energy program than India.  It is estimated that Japan has 500 kilo grams of separated plutonium stored at its  Tokai reprocessing plant, according to U.S.  sources. But Japan is operating a breeder  that requires 180 kilograms of plutonium a  year and has an atomic power research pro gram that requires 145 more kilograms of  plutonium per year.  India, by comparison, has said it ultimate ly will need 50 kilograms of plutonium to  fuel a small experimental breeder reactor  being built at Kalpakkam near Madras. Yet  its reprocessing plant is capable of turning  ",1983

Konstantine Tsigas  will be honored by his friends for his  many years of service at St. Andrew's  Greek Orthodox Church in Randolph,  N.J. He has been an inspiration to all  who know him and has worked tire lessly  to bring his congregation  the  message of God.  Reverend Tsigas grew up in the vil lage of Sitarlona in Greece, and it is  there that he was inspired to preach  the Gospel. In 1953, he went to the  University  of  Athens  Theological  School and, in November 1962, was or dained a priest in the Greek Orthodox  Church. Just 1 month later, he, his  lovely wife, Spiridoula, and his chilEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dren sailed on an ocean liner to this  country in order to spread the faith to  Greek  immigrants  in America. The  people of St. Andrew's wisely knew a  good man when  they saw one, and  asked the Reverend to be the priest  for their church.  The church  serves  all of Morris,  Sussex, Warren, and parts of Somerset  Counties and has grown from 75 fami lies to nearly 400, a testimony both to  the ability of Reverend Tsigas and the  love and concern which exudes from  the  congregation. The  church was  originally  located  in Dover, but the  amazing growth of the congregation  led to a new, larger home in Randolph,  built in 1975.  Since Reverend Tsigas  is  the only  Greek Orthodox priest in the area, he  drives more than 3,000 miles a week to  care  for  the needs of  those people  under his attentive watch. His devo tion  to  the service of God and the  Greek community is reflected  in his  commitment to his daily work and re sponsibilities.  As an American, Reverend Tsigas  can testify to the value of our consti tutional right to religious freedom. He  bravely fought the advance of Hilter  as  an  officer  in  the Greek Army  during the Nazi occupation in World  War  II,  and during  the attempted  Communist seizure of power during  the Greek civil war.  I am pleased to share with my col leagues the valuable contributions this  Greek immigrant and his family have  made to the people of northern New  Jersey. I  join St. Andrew's Church in  honoring  this man  revered  for his  wisdom and compassion for his fellow  man. My best wishes  to Reverend  Tsigas, his wife, Spiridoula, and their  three  children, Demetrios, Vasiliki,  and Kathryn, so that he might contin ue his life's work with all God's bless ings.   ILLINOIS VALLEY: HUSTLING  FOR JOBS  HON. TOM CORCORAN  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 23, 1983  e ",1983
6,,98,0.319,158,3,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, the  people of my home county of La Salle  in north central Illinois have been suf fering since 1979 from rates of unem ployment substantially above the na tional average. Back home, the impor tance of assisting small businesses to  the creation of new jobs is well-recog nized, as  is discussed  in a  report on  several meritorious efforts  there by  the Chicago Tribune's veteran colum nist, Bob Wiedrich. One of Mr. Wied rich's continuing themes, in addition  to the shortcomings of congressional  operations,  is  the  low  return  in ex penditures of  tax dollars  Illinoisans  February 23, 1983  send to Washington. Though he does  not mention Illinois Valley citizens' ef forts to improve that situation, it was  my pleasure to recently participate in  the announcement of Federal discre tionary  bridge  funding  for  the La  Salle-Peru Bridge-the result of an other combined effort by valley resi dents.  My colleagues may well find this ac count of local cooperation in pursuit  of employment opportunities and a  better life to include ideas which can  be  applied  in  their districts, and  I  therefore insert it in the RECORD.  [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 22, 19831  WE ARE HUNGARY FOR JOBS  LA SALLE,  ILL.-""We're hungry for  jobs,""  the Downstate chamber of commerce offi cial declared. ""And when you're hungry, you  get out and hustle.""  ""You don't really have to go out of state  to find people who care about small busi ness,"" wrote Leonard J. Corti, the chamber  of commerce executive director from Down state La Salle. ""One can find a very healthy  attitude in the Illinois Valley.""  I accepted Corti's invitation to visit that  region of north central Illinois, about a hun dred miles southwest of Chicago along Hwy.  80, and what I found was an amalgam of  business, labor and elected leaders working  to overcome the ravages of 16.8 percent un employment brought on by recession and  the successful recruiting efforts of Sun Belt  states.  ""The community decided  that it wasn't  going to get big employers like Ford or Gen eral Motors to come in and solve our unem ployment problems,'' said Mayor Don Baker  of Peru, La Salle's sister city along the Illi nois River.  ""So we decided  to settle  for  many small companies with as few as six or  eight employees on which to build a firm in dustrial tax base.""  Judging by the growth statistics, the game  plan is working. In the last five years, the Il linois Valley, with 140,000  residents, has  become home to 15 new light manufactur ing ventures, some with as few as 6 to 10  employees, for a  total of 1,000  jobs. Their  combined payrolls represent $18 million a  year.  And complementing those are the reloca tions of five major  trucking  lines  to  the  valley that employ 700 people, for a  total  annual payroll of $22.5 million. The new  ventures have helped boost sagging  real  estate and sales tax revenues. They have  provided jobs.  More important, they have offered hope  to people whose economy was devastated  when  the valley's single  largest employer  started closing its doors five years ago for a  move to Alabama.  Westclox, a company that had been in the  La Salle-Peru area for almost a hundred  years, finally closed its doors in 1980. At its  peak, the firm employed 5,000.  Worse, as the recession has deepened, the  valley has been losing an increasing number  of its most talented young people. About 80  percent of those who go to college do not  return. And what makes that figure even  more staggering is the fact that more than  50 percent of all high school graduates go to  college.  Community leaders are moving to mini mize traditional dependence on a handful of  major employers by seeking greater diversi ty of smaller industries.  ",1983
7,House,98,-0.123,171,3,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, if there  is any one thing that is absolutely es sential that we  learn coming out of  our experiences with the Environmen tal Protection Agency  and  all  the  problems that we have been having, it  is simply that as long as we continue  to dispose of toxic hazardous waste in  the ground or on the ground, we are  going  to continue  to have problems  with any administration and with any  agency in trying to delicately balance  all the interests that are concerned.  I will be introducing legislation this  morning which will, within 5 years,  completely eliminate all land disposal  of toxic hazardous waste. The legisla tion would also immediately after its  enactment eliminate the use of landfill  disposal of hazardous wastes if the ad ministration can certify that there are  other means of  treating  these  toxic  hazardous wastes such as incineration,  such as neutralization, such as chemi cal destruction, such as  thermal de struction.  There are numerous other ways that  we should be handling toxic chemical  wastes other than sticking them in the  ground or on the ground.  I would urge my colleagues to look  at this legislation and consider cospon soring it.

10,House,98,0.379,171,3,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, the Presi dent's opponents claim  they are for  the little guy. But look at what some  of  them want  to do-they want  to  eliminate tax indexing, which  is  the  best  protection  low-income workers  have against higher taxes.  Without  tax  indexing,  inflation  causes  taxes  to go  up by pushing  people into higher tax brackets. The  tax-and-spend crew in Congress likes  this because  it means higher  taxes  without the embarrassment of having  to vote for them.  Because of  the bracket creep,  for  every 1 percent of inflation, the Feder al Government's  income  tax  collec tions go up 1.6 percent; 1 percent of  that  figure  keeps  the Government  even with inflation, but the extra 0.6  percent is a windfall for the Govern ment-a windfall at the expense of the  taxpayers who lose purchasing power  even  though  their pretax wages are  only keeping pace with price increases.  The indexing law which is scheduled  to go into effect in 1985 is designed to  stop this mugging of the taxpayers.  Who benefits from  indexing? It is  the guy with a  low  income, not the  rich. The tax brackets are narrowest  at the low end of the scale, and the  rich are already in the highest brack et, so it is those who are hurting the  most who find themselves paying more  as a result of bracket creep.  Why,  then, do  the ""friends of the  poor""  in  this Congress want  to do  away with indexing? Such legislators  are addicted to high spending policies.  For them, raising taxes  takes prece dence over most everything else.  TO REPEAL SECTION 311 OF THE  FEDERAL  PUBLIC  TRANSPOR TATION ACT OF 1982  ",1983

13,Senate,98,-0.362,197,3,Mr. BUMPERS.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  replace the current system for issuing  oil and gas  leases on Federal  lands  with an all-competitive  system. The  legislation is identical to the proposal  which I  introduced in the past Con gress,  and  to  legislation which  the  Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee approved in the 96th Con gress.  The legislation is based upon several  premises. First, issuance of Federal oil  and gas leases constitutes an award of  valuable Government property  that  should be made on a competitive basis  in order to assure the public of a fair  price. Second,  the rights  to develop  energy resources which belong to the  taxpayers  should  not  be  awarded  through a system which invites fraud  and speculation. Third, replacing the  existing lottery system for awarding  leases with an all-competitive bidding  system would generate additional reve nues, promote diligent development of  leases, and simplify leasing procedures  to encourage rapid development of oil  and gas on Federal lands.  Mr. President, every Member of the  Senate is aware of my strong opposi tion to the way in which our federally  owned oil and gas reserves are leased. I  first became aware of the Interior De partment's leasing procedures in 1979,  when 33,000 acres near producing gas  wells  at Fort Chaffee, Ark., were  leased noncompetitively  for only $1  per acre. But  the situation at Fort  Chaffee is not unique. In many areas,  ",1983
14,Senate,98,0.196,223,3,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President,  Tuesday,  the U.S.  Supreme Court  ruled that a driver's refusal to submit  to a blood alcohol test can be intro duced as evidence against him at a  trial on drunk driving charges. This  decision gives local prosecutors yet an other weapon  in  the  fight  against  drunk driving, which, in the words of  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ""occurs  with tragic frequency on our Nation's  highways.""  I commend the Court's action. Tues day's decision, South Dakota against  Neville, recognizes that the decision to  drive or not to drive is one of choice,  and that our judicial processes should  work in ways that hold individuals re sponsible for their free actions.  Mr. President, I hope Congress will  use the occasion of this landmark deci sion  to put  its own house  in order.  Today there exists an unconscionable  loophole  in  the bankruptcy  statute  which makes  it possible  for drunk  drivers who have  injured, killed, or  caused property damage to others to  escape civil liability for their actions  by having  their  judgment debt dis charged in Federal bankruptcy court.  This  loophole  affords  opportunities  for scandalous abuse of judicial proc esses.  Imagine the heartbreak of a parent  who has been notified that his or her  child has been killed or permanently  disabled by some fellow weaving down  the road, intoxicated and totally obliv ious to the danger he poses to others.  Then  imagine  these distraught par ents  losing whatever  compensation  they have recovered for their loss be cause the drunk driver has turned to  the Federal bankruptcy court system  and has had his liability discharged.  Or, imagine the hardship on children  who lose a father, a mother, or per haps both to a drunk driver who  is  then relieved of his debt. Unfortunate ly, these are not simply hypothetical  possibilities. The bankruptcy process   ",1983

There are many proposals now pend ing before this Congress to provide as sistance to the unemployed.

The  administration  has  projected  unemployment levels above 10 percent  for  the remainder of  this year, and  near that for the next 2 years. It is not  that people are not  trying  to  find  work; they are and the media is full of  examples-20,000 people in Milwaukee  lined up in January for 200 jobs; 2,000  people in Peoria lined up for 100 jobs;  30,000  people  in Chicago  lined  up  for 2,000 jobs. The list is endless.  People are doing without the basic  necessities,  losing  everything  they  have worked  their whole  lives  to  obtain; standing in line for hours to  get a pound of cheese or a single stick  of butter; losing their homes; keeping  their heat  turned off because  they  cannot afford the utility bills; neglect ing medical care for  themselves and  their children because they no longer  have issurance and do not qualify for  medicaid.

18,,98,0.304,262,3,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, my col league the senior Senator from Illinois  recently addressed  the  Illinois Mine  Workers Legislative Conference on the  problems of the high sulfur coal indus try and the need to assure the future  of midwestern  coal. Senator PERCY  finds that the impact of proposed acid  rain legislation is as severe for Illinois  as it is for Indiana and other midwest ern  coal-producing  States.  Senator  PERCY points out that the acid rain  legislation proposed last year by the  Senate Committee  on Environment  and Public Works may have no impact  on acid rain problems in the most sen sitive areas while a  liming program  would provide immediate relief, relief  which is needed until scientific knowl edge advances far enough to suggest a  reasonable solution  to  the acid  rain  problem.  The  Subcommittee  on  Energy,  Nuclear  Proliferation  and  Government Processes has  also  re leased  two  valuable  studies of  the  impact of this proposed legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of Senator PERCY'S speech and  the  studies. by  the Department of  Energy  and  the Congressional Re search  Service  be  printed  in  the  RECORD  for  the benefit of my col leagues.  The material follows:  ADDRESS OF SENATOR CHARLES H. PERCY  Rich Trumka, John Banovic, Leroy Bauer,  Joe Angleton, Jerry Hawkins, and my mine  workers friends. I deeply appreciate your in viting me here today to address this Annual  Legislative Conference of the United Mine  Workers of America.  Since the topic of your conference is legis lation, let me begin by just mentioning one  piece of legislation which I feel will adverse ly affect not  just mine workers, but all  Americans who work and strive to save and  invest for their financial futures.  Last  summer,  the Congress decided  it  would be a good thing to begin withholding  Federal income taxes on both interest and  dividend  income. In the Senate, that par ticular provision passed on a close vote of 50  to 48. I am proud of the fact that I was one  of the 48 Senators who opposed this provi sion. It runs counter to all of the things we  have been trying to do in order to stimulate  more personal savings.  I wanted to tell all of you who have taken  the time to write your elected representa tives in Washington about this matter that  your message is being heard loud and clear.  In the last four weeks, my office alone has  received over 200,000 cards and letters on  this  issue-more mail  than on any other  single issue in the entire time I have been in  the Senate. More mail on withholding than  on Watergate, Vietnam, the Panama Canal,  and even labor law reform. I have already  introduced  legislation  to  repeal  this  law.  Keep those cards and letters coming in until  it's taken off the books!  I certainly do not need to tell you about  the troubles faced by Illinois miners. Thirty  percent of our miners are out of work-5,000  miners out of a work force of 16,000. Domes tic and international markets for our coal  are sluggish, despite a good price and our  best efforts to promote exports. Non-unionized Western coal continues to make inroads  into  the  traditional markets for our coal.  And  acid  rain  legislation  in Washington  poses a significant threat to the Illinois coal  industry.  I am not pleased with the present condi tions for Illinois mine workers, and I know  you aren't. Your challenge and mine is to  see what we can do about it. There are some  important and meaningful things that we  can do. There are some things we should  not do.  Illinois  is  the  ""Saudi Arabia"" of coal.  There are an estimated 162 billion tons of  identifiable and recoverable coal reserves in  Illinois-enough coal to provide centuries of  power to American and foreign consumers.  We must not permit Illinois coal to be lost  as a national energy asset.  We are not going to let the Federal Gov ernment turn its back on important funding  for fossil fuel research and development. I  will vigorously fight the Office of Manage ment and Budget's proposal to slash by 58  percent the funding for these crucial R&D  projects. We need more of the kind of re search being carried out at Argonne Nation al Laboratory in Illinois-like the dry-scrub ber that I dedicated one year ago-not less.  I will also continue to fight with Congress man PAUL SIMON  to  turn the Carbondale  Mining Technology Center into a national  center  for  research  into overcoming  the  problems of the high-sulfur coal industry.  We must not allow the current glut in the  oil market to lull us into excessive depend ence on a single energy source. The full uti lization of high-sulfur coal as a liquid fuel methanol-can and will be  important  to  future generations.  In fact, while we  in  the United States  have been slow to develop a real interest in  the use of methanol, the Japanese have al ready  expressed  their  eagerness  to  use  methanol as a clean burning boiler fuel. As  Chairman of the Foreign Relations Commit tee, I have been working on a project with  the Japanese government which, over a 30year period, could use as much as 186 mil lion tons of number six Illinois coal.  In a nutshell, the project calls for the con struction of a methanol plant in Panama  that would be supplied with  Illinois coal  shipped through New Orleans. The metha nol would be piped across Panama to super tankers for the trip across  the Pacific to  Japan. I am happy to report that progress  to date on this project ha.s been good-we  already have $2.5 million in federal support  for the project and we fully expect the pri vate sector  in  the U.S. and the Japanese  government to lend additional support.  I know that the issue of highest priority  at your Legislative Conference this year is  the acid rain legislation that has been intro duced in the 98th Congress. Despite the lack  of firm scientific evidence,  this legislation  calls for a ten-million ton annual reduction  of sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmos phere. It places the entire burden of reduc ing emissions on the Midwest-on the utili ties  that burn high sulfur coal and, ulti mately, on  the miners who extract  that  coal.  It callously  disregards  the human  misery that will be felt from Illinois to West  Virginia.  Up until now, the debate on this legisla tion has unfortunately been couched in the  rhetoric  of  ""environmentalists""  versus  ""labor and industrial concerns."" I do not see  it that way. In my sixteen years in the U.S.  Senate, I have worked closely with both in dustry and labor and I have enjoyed your  support. And no one can question my record  as an environmentalist or my support for  providing a  clean and healthful environ ment for all Americans. The real question at  hand on this legislation is whether this can  be achieved without sufficient evidence as  to whether the benefits will outweigh the  costs which would be borne by thousands of  American workers and consumers.  Let's look at those costs. Six months ago, I  asked  the U.S. Department of Energy  to  prepare an impact statement on how this  acid rain legislation would affect the high  sulfur coal  industry. I was so startled by  their findings that I asked another agency,  the Congressional Research Service of the  U.S. Library of Congress, to conduct its own  study. I am releasing both of these studies  to you today. This is what they had to say:  Over  21,000  Illinois miners  and  allied  workers will permanently lose their jobs if  this legislation becomes law;  Most utilities now burning  Illinois coal  will switch to low-sulfur Western coal as the  least costly way to comply with the strin gent S-0-2 reductions called for in the legis lation;  By 1995, Illinois coal production will drop  by at least 40 percent, or 25.6 million tons, if  this legislation becomes law;  The brunt of this decline in coal produc tion will be felt in Randolph, Perry, Jack son, Williamson, Saline, and Gallatin Coun ties. Dr. Larry Parker of the Congressional  Research Service  calls  the  impact  ""very  harsh."" Unemployment  in  these counties,  already at 18.2 percent last December, will  be driven up to an unbelievable 29 percent.  Personal income in those counties will drop  by $200 million or 20 percent.  These casualties will be created despite  the lack of evidence on the ""benefits"" side.  despite  the fact that we already have an  acid rain strategy in place that requires up  to a 90 percent reduction in S-0-2 emissions  for new emissions sources. Despite the belief  by some scientists that the 10-million-ton S0-2 reduction called for by the legislation  may not save a single fish or tree.  Let me tell you about my approach to this  problem. It calls for evidence, hard facts on  the benefits and the costs. I have cospon sored legislation with Senator Byrd of West  Virginia that will accelerate  the study of  this problem, and get us clear answers to  this problem no later than 1987. Our ap proach says let's not wait until 1995, as the  acid rain legislation says, to bring relief to  the sports fishing industry of the Northeast.  Let us bring relief in 1984 through a federal  program  to  fund  the  liming of acidified  lakes, regardless of the cause.  Let's follow the lead of Sweden, which has  successfully brought back to life up to 1,500  lakes where  fish  had  previously  been  dying-at a cost of only five million dollars,  no lost jobs, and no increased costs to utili ties and consumers. Sweden plans to expand  this program to 20,000 lakes by 1986.  The Byrd bill, which I fully support, pro vides for up to 75 percent federal support  for state liming programs similar to those  which have been so successful in Sweden.  The most important aspect of this bill  is  that we are preserving  jobs while we are  searching for a viable solution to the acid  rain problem-one which is based on hard  facts and clear evidence.  We have learned from the U.S. Depart ment of Energy and the Congressional Re search Service that the acid rain legislation  currently pending in Congress would cause  an economic catastrophe in America's heart land. It will retard conversions to coal from  overpriced Canadian natural gas and  im",1983
19,Senate,98,0.219,288,3,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I sup port S. 4 7, the Ocean Shipping Act of  1983,  a  bill  to  revise  regulation of  international liner shipping operating  in the U.S. foreign commerce.  After years of hearings and debate,  this long-awaited legislation will bring  U.S. regulation of international ocean borne commerce into the 1980's-this  change is sorely needed.  The Shipping Act of 1916 cannot ac commodate the radical changes that  have taken place in both international  and domestic economic and political  environments. First, the Ocean Ship ping Act of 1983 responds to the need  to achieve comity with our  trading  partners  in  regulating  ocean  com merce. This is accomplished by clarify ing the antitrust immunity that is ex tended  to  international ocean  liner  conferences. Essentially, the rules of  the game  are better definded  and  more  consistent with  international  practices.  Second,  in clarifying  the scope of  the antitrust immunity, the legislation  serves to better balance the burden of  fear of prosecution under U.S. anti trust laws. Existing law weighs heavily  on American  interests while  foreign  liner operators, under the protection  of  their governments, have  little or  nothing to fear from enforcement of  U.S. antitrust laws. It is high time that  we act to correct the unfairness of this  situation by making  the  rules  the  same for everyone in the liner ship ping business.  Third, this bill deregulates sensibly.  By eliminating the costly and  timeAs  consuming preapproval review of com mercial  agreements by  the Federal  Maritime Commission, private enter prise can more quickly respond to a  changing  international marketplace.  Elimination of unnecessary  interven tion by  the Federal Government  in  commercial activities is a primary ob jective of S. 1593, and  is consistent  with  the  Commerce  Committee's  desire and  the Senate's wish  to  im prove the performance and productivi ty of Government agencies. Ths bill  also  reduced  the wasteful, needless,  and  confusing dual  jurisdiction be tween the Federal Maritime Commis sion and the Department of Justice.  Predictability  in the enforcement of  our maritime statutes has been want ing of  late. Unfortunately,  this has  caused increasing friction among our  trading partners and uncertainty  in  the industry, the tremendous costs of  which are not easily measured.  Finally,  the passage of S. 4 7 will  begin an era of prosperity for U.S. ex ports. No one here can argue the im portance of increasing the export of  U.S. goods and products  to  foreign  markets. The health and welfare of  the American  economy depends on  sustaining growth  in  this area. The  key to growth is in creating an envi ronment conducive  to shipping U.S.  goods abroad. This important legisla tion is a critical step in that process.  the bill  took shape, compromises  reached between the export shippers  and  the ocean carriers assured that  commercial flexibility is at the heart  of  this  legislation.  In providing  for  service  contracts,  including  time/  volume rates, and independent action,  this legislation allows U.S. shippers to  exercise considerable flexibility in ar ranging favorable  terms for the car riage of U.S. products to foreign mar kets. This means that U.S. goods will  be more competitive  in foreign mar kets. Export growth will follow.  Furthermore,  American  interests  will be better able to capitalize on the  efficiencies of intermodalism by clari fying regulatory  jurisdiction of such  cargo movements. Dual intermodal ju risdiction between the ICC and FMC is  harmful to U.S. foreign commerce and  needs  to be eliminated. This Nation  can no longer afford to not take full  advantage of advances  in intermodal  technology and the commercial oppor tunities that follow.  Even beyond the strong support of  the many and diverse elements of the  maritime industry, this legislation has  widespread support from other areas  as well. Our Nation's ports have en dorsed this bill. Shippers, both large  and small, believe this bill would result  in lower freight rates and more flexi ble service. The overwhelmingly favor able vote on a similar bill last year in  the House of Representatives-350 in  favor  to only 33 opposed-is further  evidence of the worth of this legislation. The issue clearly enjoys biparti san support.  This legislation is sorely misunder stood. The bill is fundamentally a long  step toward deregulation. It provides  U.S. enterprise with greater freedom  and flexibility to better compete in a  dynamic international marketplace. It  clarifies the scope of antitrust immu nity clouded by years of piecemeal  court decisions and regulatory zeal.  The need to change the way we reg ulate international maritime trade  is  long overdue. S. 47 is a good start and  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this measure.  e ",1983
20,Senate,98,0.135,288,3,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the committee that has  oversight over a number of transporta tion modes,  I  am pleased with  the  product now being brought before the  Senate and urge its passage.  The Shipping Act of 1983 is unusual  in that it repiesents for the most part  a consensus of carriers and shippers those who  provide  ocean  shipping  services and are seeking to maximize  income, and those who are consumers  of that service seeking the lowest cost  ocean transportation. For this reason,  I  feel  comfortable  that  the Senate  Commerce Committee  has  reported  out an excellent piece of legislation.  At the end of World War II, U.S.  ships carried the most of U.S. goods  moving in foreign commerce. Today,  roughly  25  percent of  these goods  move on U.S. ships. In other words,  U.S. carrie?""s receive only $4.5 billion  of the $15 billion freight bill paid by  U.S. producers to move $200 billion of  U.S. goods on liner ships.  A major reason for U.S. carriers' di minishing role in ocean commerce is  our outmoded and complicated system  of Federal regulation, which has been  more heavily  enforced  against U.S.  carriers than their foreign competition  and imposed operating restrictions in hibiting  their ability  to  respond  to  changing market  conditions  and  to  best serve shippers' needs.  S. 47  is a  long-overdue update and  recodification of these laws. Its intent  is to clarify this antiquated and highly  technical statute <the Shipping Act,  1916)  to  reflect  today's commercial  needs and requirements.  By  streamlining  the  regulatory  review process and by increasing op portunities for marketplace competi tion, many federally imposed barriers,  which helped to inflate transportation  costs, will be removed. Once these bar riers are removed,  the marketplace's  competitive forces should aid U.S. pro ducers and carriers in their efforts to  contain and reduce ocean transporta tion costs.  A recent General Accounting Office  study on the need for maritime regula tory reform also recommends eliminat ing these Federal regulatory barriers.  It offered  two options for doing so.  ",1983
21,,98,-0.304,314,3,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to draw congressional attention  to the intensification of antichurch ac tivities in the Soviet Union.  Any Soviet official will tell you that  individuals can worship as they please  in the U.S.S.R. The Soviet Constitu tion, he says, guarantees freedom of  religion and freedom from religion. A  clever phrase, but what does it mean?  It means religious sites are razed, reli gious processions are disrupted, and  religious  officials  are  prevented sometimes  violently-from  carrying  out their functions.  In the wake of the Polish unrest and the strong role of the Catholic  Church in that protest-religious re pression has become more widespread  and more brutal, particularly in Po land's small but  strategic neighbor  Lithuania. Since October 1980,  three  priests have been murdered under sus picious  circumstances  in Lithuania.  Eyewitnesses saw one of the victims,  Father Bronius Laurinavicius, thrown  beneath  the wheels  of  a  speeding  truck. The KGB has been implicated  in  all  three deaths  and numerous  other physical assaults on priests. The  young Father Ricardas Cerniauskas  was warned by Soviet security police  to silence his criticism of the system or  face an extraordinary death. And now,  for the first time in 10 years, a priest  faces  imprisonment  in Lithuania for  February 24, 1983  religious activity. On January 26, the  Soviet news agency Tass reported that  Father Alfonsas Svarinskas had been  charged with anti-Soviet activity for  giving sermons that systematically in stigated believers,  to wage, an open  struggle against Soviet power.  The opening of criminal proceedings  against  Father  Svarinskas  coupled  with heightened harassment of Catho lics  in general  is a clear sign  from  Moscow to the Lithuanian Church: It  will not enjoy the latitude allowed the  Polish Church. At the same time, the  unusual announcement of a human  rights arrest by Tass may be regarded  as an ominous test of Western opinion  before  a  renewed  crackdown  on  human rights activity in Lithuania.  The Soviet Union adheres to a clear  double  standard  on  human  rights  issues. It is fine for the government to  profess its commitment to liberty and  freedom, but any  individual who re quests that these promises be kept is  subject to intimidation, imprisonment,  or even death. We cannot allow this  brutal disregard for human dignity to  go unnoticed. The people of Lithua nia-a nation that has always received  steadfast U.S. support-deserve our at tention and concern. I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in public protest  against religious repression in Lithua nia.e  LEGISLATION  TO  DESIGNATE  JANUARY  4,  1984 AS ALASKA  STATEHOOD DAY  HON. DON YOUNG  OF ALASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1983  e ",1983
22,,98,0.278,314,3,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speak er, 25 years ago  this June, Congress  approved  the Alaska Statehood Act,  paving the way for Alaska's entry into  the Union as  the 49th State.  I am  proud to introduce today in the House  of Representatives a  resolution com memorating the silver anniversary of  Alaska statehood.  Alaska's entry into the Union was  not easily accomplished. World War II  had pointed to the necessity of state hood for Alaska. The Japanese inva sion of the Aleutians, lend lease flights  across Alaska to the Soviet Union, and  later  the cold war and  its resulting  early warning radar stations convinced  the Nation that Alaska was vital  to  the national defense. Even  so,  the  Alaska statehood  issue was a hotly  contested  subject during  the 1950's  with  the  chief  arguments  against  statehood being Alaska's alleged  in ability to pay its own way and the fact  that Alaska was not contiguous to the  continental United States.  In  June  1958,  after numerous proposals and  counterproposals, Congress approved  statehood for Alaska. On July 7, 1958,  ",1983
23,,98,-0.516,327,3,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, it is with great pride and admira tion that I join in the commemoration  of the 65th anniversary of Estonian  Independence Day. The  remarkable  strength and proud heritage of the Es tonian people  in  the Soviet Union,  who  face  a  never-ending  quest  to  regain their freedom, has established a  model for the world.  Today we mark the proclamation of  independence for the Republic of Es tonia. The Estonians made significant  economic,  educational,  and  cultural  progress until their freedom and inde pendence came to an end in 1940 when  they were  forcibly  annexed by  the  Soviet Union. On a day-to-day basis in  the Soviet Union,  the Estonians are  facing serious attacks to rid them of  their strong sense of heritage. They  face serious threats to their language  and culture. This is yet another exam ple of the Soviet attempt to Russian ize these people out of existence.  Free nations of the world must con tinue to speak out against this Soviet  aggression. We will never  recognize  their seizure of Estonia. As a signatory  of  the Helsinki accords,  the Soviet  Union continues to deny these individ uals  their basic human  rights-the  free exercise of political, cultural, and  religious freedoms.  Mr. Speaker, I am very moved by the  strength and conviction of these brave  people. I am thankful for this oppor",1983
24,,98,0.227,340,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  want to call the attention of my col leagues to a recent tragedy in Afghani stan. I believe that this incident recon firms that the Soviets will do anything  to maintain  their viselike grip over  that once free and peaceful nation.  As all of you know, the brutal Soviet  occupation of Afghanistan began  in  1980. Since that time, Afghani resist ance fighters have engaged in a lonely,  and  difficult  guerrilla  campaign  against  superior  Russian  air  and  ground  forces. Although  the heavy  fighting will  continue,  the Kremlin  has already basically fulfilled its pri mary objectives in Afghanistan. It has  set up the puppet Karma! regime in  Kabul and has occupied the country  with 105,000 well-armed troops.  According to the article which ap peared in the Washington Post this  month, over 105 Afghani men, women,  and children were brutally burned to  death  in  an  underground well  by  Soviet soldiers. The ""Resting Place of  the Comb"" is a small village some 30  miles south of Kabul.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  As Soviet  soldiers  and  tanks  ap proached the small village, many of its  frightened inhabitants fled and hid in  an underground water  tunnel  that  serves as the town's water supply. Fol lowing  the  commanding  officer's  orders, Soviet soldiers pumped hun dreds of gallons of gasoline into the  tunnel when the Afghani villagers re fused  to  come out of  their hiding  place. A few minutes later, after incen diary chemicals were dropped into the  tunnel, the gasoline was  ignited and  105  innocent people were burned to  death. It took 7 days for the villagers  to drag all of the bodies out of the  tunnel.  The World Press has carried equally  horrible stories of Soviet forces poi soning village wells, using poison gas,  and strafing innocent Afghanis with  the  intimidating  firepower of  their  helicopters. While all of this violence  goes on, the Kremlin insists that it is a  peace-loving  nation which  respects  human rights and has no expansionist  tendencies.  In spite of more than 12,000 Soviet  dead and wounded and an estimated  $1.5 billion in direct aid merely to prop  up the Afghan army, I believe that the  Russians intend to stay.  With this in mind, our Government  should do everything in its power to  call this bloody occupation of a small  and peaceful nation to the attention  of the world. Let us also bring pres sure to bear on the Soviets to convince  them that they must withdraw. I am  sure that many of my colleagues can  recall  the many  clever  techniques  which the Kremlin used against our  Government when we were so heavily  involved in Vietnam a number of years  ago. Let all of us  in  the Congress  commit ourselves to getting the illegal  occupiers out of Af ghanistan.e  CONGRESSIONAL  COMMEMORA TIVE  SALUTE TO THE ESTO NIAN  PEOPLE ON THE  65TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  ESTONIAN  INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON.

26,,98,-0.336,353,3,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker, during  the January 1983  recess,  I  joined a  congressional  delegation  tour  of  Russia and three Eastern bloc coun tries to review our Government's rela tions with those nations, particularly  concerning East-West trade-including  export controls-rights violations, and  the status of current disarmament ne gotiations. The delegation visited Len ingrad, Moscow, Budapest, Bucharest,  and Belgrade. The trip also included  Athens where our delegation met with  European parliamentarians on similar  issues.  While the U.S. delegation met with a  variety of officials and covered a range  of subjects, I am limiting this report to  human rights issues.  Overall, there is no discernible im provement  in  the oppressive  condi tions that exist in Communist coun tries. As the world becomes more con scious of human rights as a measure of  national decency and many countries  are working to improve the political  conditions as an acceptable form of  national behavior, we found little evi dence  of  similar  improvements  in  Russia and her satellite neighbors. If  anything,  the political  climate has  worsened in Russia and Romania with  small likelihood that there will be any  easing of the internal tension that is  so obvious in those two countries. We  discovered cautious optimism  in  the  other countries as limited freedom is  3077  being experienced, but that may prove  illusionary depending on a number of  factors in what definitely is an uncer tain future  for  the people of  these  areas.  At least two important developments  add to that uncertainty. First, Secre tary Yury Andropov, who has emerged  as the undisputed boss at the Kremlin,  remains an enigmatic political figure.  In Russia, it is obvious that everyone  was waiting and watching to see what  kind of  leadership he will provide.  Andropov has moved quickly on  a  campaign against  corruption, which  was interpreted as legitimate given the  widespread abuses at higher levels, but  also a move of weeding out the decay ing and possibly hostile elements  in  high level government and party posi tions.  The new Kremlin leader is viewed as  smart and tough, and capable of pro viding  enlightened  leadership  com pared to the more bureaucratic Leonid  Brezhnev, but he is equally adept of  using his personal resources as a ruth less and unrelenting advocate of global  communism. The consensus is that it  is much too early to tell how he will  deal with  human  rights  issues  at  home, or how much latitude will be  given to Soviet-dominated countries in  Eastern Europe.  The second factor may be beyond  Andropov's or anyone's control, for it  concerns the economic fate of these  countries. Everywhere we visited,  it  was the state of the economy, particu larly the emerging Third World coun tries and the shaky international fi nancial  system  that worried people  the most. Economic strains were being  felt, particularly in Hungary, Roma nia, and Yugoslavia. The link between  economic -conditions,  public  unrest  and  suppression  is an undisputable  fact. Poland is an obvious reminder.  Leaders with whom we met talked in cessantly about their economic prob lems and urged the United States to  be sensitive and provide more help. In  my judgment, the human rights pic ture will not improve under such con ditions. As these regimes become more  threatened by greater unrest among  their populations, who have enjoyed  meager but relatively bitter economic  standards, there will undoubtedly be  more repressive measures introduced.  u.s.s.R.  In our 4-day visit  to Russia, we  found no improvement in the human  rights situation. If anything, we heard  repeated  statements  about  a  new  crackdown. There was little evidence  that immigration quotas, which have  declined remarkably in recent years,  would improve. Refuseniks were frus trated in their attempts to leave the  country.

27,House,98,-0.502,366,3,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  natural gas decontrol bill which the  Reagan administration is  introducing  today  is hailed by  the President as  that rarest of all commodities-a free  lunch. According  to  the President,  prices will go down, supplies will go  up, the free market will operate per fectly to bring buyers and sellers to gether in harmony-in short, everyone  will be fat and happy.  Mr. Speaker, that ""free lunch"" will  be cooked with gas, but it will not be  free. It is the American consumer who  is going to pick up the $50 billion tab.  We are in our present predicament,  with demand down and prices soaring  up, because natural gas producers and  natural gas pipelines used current leg islation  and  an  inactive  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission to bid  prices  out  of  reason  on  contracts  which pass costs on to the consumers  whether or not  the gas  is  actually  shipped or consumed.  Those same companies now claim  that the contracts which they negoti ated are the blame of regulation and  not their own greed. So how does the  administration respond?  D 1230  Take away any ceilings on gas dis covered before 1977, which was never  to be decontrolled.  The  administration's proposal  for  extinguishing a fire is to pour on more  fuel. It is  like saying ""We are going  too fast; step on the gas.""  What we need is a solution to the  current gas price increases that treats  all Americans fairly, that assures ade quate supplies, adequate incentive for  gas exploration and reasonable prices.  The  President's proposal  assures  none of these basic criteria. His pro posal  is only a  fool's rush  to stuff  more dollars into the pockets of the  major oil companies. There is no free  lunch. There can be none. When the  President  learns  that  basic  lesson,  then and only then will the American  people  accept  his word  on  energy  policy.  The residential consumer and Amer ica's small businesses and farmers de serve the assurance that their liveli hoods will not be endangered by the  cost of keeping warm. They deserve  the help in the midst of their peril.  They deserve much more  than  the  wolf of decontrol  in  the attractive  wrapping of consumer protection.  ",1983

29,Senate,98,0.444,431,3,Mr. TOWER.," Mr. President, I would  like  to call  to  the attention of  the  Senate a report written by my distin guished colleague, the senior Senator  from South Carolina, Senator STROM  THURMOND.  Senator THURMOND visited the Fed eral Republic of Germany following  the adjournment of the 97th Congress  and  toured several military  installa tions. He also had occasion  to visit  with Ambassador Burns and his staff  and receive  their views on German American relations. Additionally, Sen ator THURMOND had the opportunity  to meet with officials of the German  Ministry of State and Ministry of De fense.  Senator THURMOND's report indicates  very  serious German  concern  over  issues such as ""Specialty Metals"" and  the deletion of funds for ""Host Nation  Support."" The decision on ""Specialty  Metals"" alone could well destroy the  cooperative efforts on standardizing  NATO arms that have been underway  since 1976.  Mr. President, I find Senator THUR MOND's analysis  to be  timely and  I  commend it to the attention of my col leagues. I ask that the report with en closures be included in the RECORD at  the conclusion of my remarks.  The report follows:  General.-During  VISIT TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF  GERMANY-SENATOR STROM THURMOND  INTRODUCTION  the  period December  26-31,  1982,  Senator Strom Thurmond,  Ranking Majority Member of  the Senate  Armed Services Committee and Chairman  of its Military Construction Subcommittee  visited military installations in the Federal  Republic of Germany <FRG ). In addition,  Senator Thurmond met with officials of the  German government, and with Ambassador  Burns and his staff.  Purpose.-Senator Thurmond last visited  the FRG during April 1981. In making a  return visit to the FRG, Senator Thurmond  set several objectives:  1. To review the facilities situation with  emphasis on the living and working condi tions faced by American service personnel;  2. To review with major U.S. military com manders the overall balance of forces situa tion;  3. To meet with key German government  officials to discuss matters of mutual con cern; and  4. To confer with Ambassador Burns and  his staff to get the benefit of their views on  German-American relations.  Itinerary.-Travel to and from the FRG  was by regularly scheduled Military Airlift  Command C-5 aircraft. Senator Thurmond  arrived in the FRG on the morning of De cember  27,  1982,  and  departed  in  the  evening on December 31, 1982. Locations  visited included Ramstein Air Force Base  Baumholder, Heidelberg, Bonn, Frankfurt:  Fulda, Wildflecken, and Rhein Main Air  Force Base. Key officials contacted included  General Frederick Kroesen, Commanding  General, U.S. Army Europe; Lieutenant  General Robert Bazley, Deputy Command ing General, U.S. Air Forces Europe; Dr.  Arthur Burns, U.S. Ambassador to the Fed eral Republic of Germany; His Excellency  Peter-Kurz Wuerzbach, FRG Ministry of  Defense  and His Excellency Berndt von  Staden, FRG Ministry of State.

32,Senate,98,0.115,470,3,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, today we observe the 11th anni versary of the signing of the Shanghai  Communique which  recognized  the  People's Republic of China as the one  and only Government of China. This  is a particularly memorable occasion  for me because 4 years ago today I ad dressed this issue in my first speech in  the Senate.  This communique and the Taiwan  Relations Act created a deliberately  ambiguous situation. These acts recog nized the legitimacy of the PRC while  insuring a close and continuing friend ship with Taiwan. This policy has  become particularly vexsome because  both share a common vision of China,  both  claim  the  same  territory  for  China, and both adamantly refuse to  consider any form of partition. This  ambiguity became particularly clear  when our Government entered  into  negotiations to sell fighter aircraft to  Taiwan.  While the political and military as pects of this situation have been high lighted in the press,  there is a very  worrisome issue that has not received  the worldwide attention  that  it de serves. The human rights situation in  Taiwan remains as serious as it was 4  years ago, when I was prompted  to  speak out in the Senate. The concerns  I had then are the same today. While  we have guaranteed our political rela tions with Taiwan, we have done noth ing to insure that the Government of  Taiwan  observes  the  basic  human  rights of its people. Today, under mar tial  law,  the people of Taiwan are  denied the same rights guaranteed to  the citizens of our other allies. I can  see no excuse for denying the Taiwan ese  the  freedoms  and  fundamental  rights  that  are  already  denied  to  people on the mainland. Martial law  must come to an end in Taiwan so that  the people's right  to self-determina tion  and  representative  government  can begin.  But martial law is not the only issue.  We often overlook the fact that the  native Taiwanese are distinct from the  mainland Chinese. As such, they are in  the unenviable position of seeing their  homeland treated by both the Com munist and the KMT governments as  simply a  province of China,  rather  than a distinct entity. Their position is  not dissimilar from that of people in  the Baltic States, who have been in corporated into the Soviet Union de spite a history and ethnicity which are  not Russian.  The Shanghai Communique  is  a  unique solution to a vexsome problem  involving  three governments. But  it  accepts without question the position  long held by both the Communist and  the KMT  governments  concerning  Taiwan. As such, it is incomplete, for  it does not take into account the views  of  the native Taiwanese  themselves.  This oversight  is  regrettable,  to say  the least.  Clearly, we  cannot  repudiate  the  Shanghai Communique. But I believe  that we ought to bear in mind the po sition and the concerns of the native  Taiwanese when we deal with the Peo ple's Republic and with authorities on  Taiwan. To accept without question  the view  that native Taiwanese are  Chinese  subjects-regardless of who  ",1983

Recently.  the announcement of a  new waste-to-energy  powerplant  in  Lincoln, Nebr., proved  the value of  these  tax credits. Thanks  to  these  credits  and  accelerated depreciation  provisions of the 1981 Economic Re covery Tax Act, more than 200 tempo rary construction jobs will be created  in  the  community  by  this  plant.  Roughly 20 permanent  jobs will be  created and the environmental condi tion of the city will be  improved as  well.

35,House,98,-0.472,509,3,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 999, and wish to com mend  the  Interior Committee  on  which I serve, and the Education and  Labor Committee for moving expedi tiously to report H.R. 999 for the full  House's consideration. The legislation  before us, draws our attention to and  properly  focuses  on  the  important  issues of youth unemployment and the  protection  of  our natural  resource  base. With youth unemploYrn.ent at  record levels,  this bill will provide a  cost-effective program by which we  can  off er  our  unemployed  young  people meaningful conservation  jobs  that foster in them a value and under standing of our natural resources and  in doing so, show them that they are a  worthwhile part of what makes this  country as great as it is.  In my own State of Minnesota, we  have had a  successful Federal-State  conservation program for a number of  years. Before Reagan administration  budget cuts  took hold, between 500  and 600 young Minnesotans were in volved in a coordinated effort to reha bilitate and upgrade Minnesota State  parks, historic sites, game refuges, and  wildlife areas. With the demise of the  YCC  and YACC  programs,  the  re source managers within the State of  Minnesota have been hard pressed to  respond to conservation and rehabili tation needs.  The need for resource conservation  work is well documented. H.R. 999 is a  means by which we can meet this need  in a cost-effective way while achieving  important social goals. In the present  time of fiscal restraint, this legislation  will deliver services of a greater value  than the cost of the program. With  funds  to  carry  out  the  program  coming from the sale and use of our  natural resources, we are recognizing  the rieed to retrench funds back into  the resource base.  H.R. 999 is designed to promote the  development of our greatest natural  resource-our young people. The un employment  rate  that exists among  our youth,  especially minority  and  economically disadvantaged youth, is a  national shame. At a  time when we  should be promoting the development  of our young people to become produc tive members of our society, the stark  figures of youth unemployment attest  to our  inability  to make use of the  minds,  energy,  and  ambition  our  young people possess.  Shortly,  this House will begin  the  consideration of emergency jobs legis lation. H.R. 999 gives us the opportu nity to work hand-in-hand with that  effort to alleviate the tragic statistics  of youth unemployment. In a modest  way, the American Conservation Corps  program  is a step that says we are  going to do something with regard to  addressing  the serious youth unem ployment tragedy.  Sympathy  for  the problem  is not  enough. There  ne.eds  to  be  some  action. The American Conservation  Corps program fits  that need. If we  are serious about the problems we face  in maintaining our natural resources  and providing '.for the growth and de velopment of our young people, then  we will enact H.R. 999, I urge its pas sage.

As he knows,  the  amendment  is  technically nongermane to this bill as  this bill does not deal with the promo tional  aspects  of merchant marine  policy, but merely with its regulatory  aspects.  The Senator from Minnesota also  knows that I have some very real sym pathies with him in some of the goals  which  he  is  attempting  to  reach  through  the  presentation  of  this  amendment. During the course of the  97th Congress he and I were on oppo site sides of a number of attempts to  either repeal the preference elements  of Public Law 480 or to at lea.st put a  limit on those elements.  He knows that while I feel it appro priate to preserve present cargo pref erence laws, I have not been active in  any attempts to expand or to increase  them.  The Senator from Minnesota also  knows that I do not wish in any way to  subvert or to harm the prospects of  the United States in selling agricultur al commodities overseas. That kind of  sale is going to be every bit as benefi cial  to my own constituents  in  the  State of Washington as it will be to  those of the Senator from Minnesota.  We  attempted  to  come  up with  something, working frantically while  debate was going on on other amend ments, which could do this. I am sym pathetic, but in the absence of hear ings on the subject dealing specifically  with new programs, such as PIK, we  were unable to reach that kind of ac commodation at this point.  I would simply want to thank the  Senator from Minnesota for bringing  this matter to our attention, for not  pressing it to a vote on a bill which is  already controversial, and  to assure  him, as he already knows, that I do  have a great deal of sympathy with  some elements of what he is trying to  do  in order to strike an appropriate  balance  preserving  the  merchant  marine but granting  the maximum  possible ability to all of our farmers  and agriculturalists to sell as much of  their commodities overseas as possible.  I can assure him I will try to help  him reach that goal in the future.  ",1983
42,Senate,98,-0.332,574,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I am sub mitting legislation entitled the ""Feder al Correctional Education Assistance  Act."" It would authorize the Secretary  of Education to make grants to State  education  agencies  for  educational  programs in correctional institutions.  The need for this legislation is con siderable. The prison population of  our Nation,  today,  is at an all-time  high of 500,000 people. Over the past 4  years the incarceration rate for adult  offenders has increased by more than  50  percent.  In  addition,  another  1,800,000  juveniles and adults are on  probation and parole.  The United States currently spends  about $6 billion a year to house  in mates in State correctional facilities,  local  jails,  and Federal  institutions  and centers. This amounts to almost  $13,000 a year for each inmate. That is  a  staggering amount, which exceeds  the cost of education for a year at  either Harvard or Yale. In fact, on the  average this Nation spends 2112  times  as much money on keeping a person in  prison than on sending a young man  or woman to college.  As awful as  these figures are, one  might derive some consolation from  them if these inmates were being pre pared for a productive, responsible life  upon release from prison. Sadly, that  simply is not the case.  Of the $6 billion spent to maintain  our prison system, more than 80 per cent is spent on control and security.  Less than 20 percent is spent on reha bilitation  and  training,  and  the  amount  spent  on  educational  pro grams and  services  is  even smaller.  Recent data from the National Institute of Education revealed that only 2  percent of the total cost of incarcer ation goes to vocational education and  related programs. On the average, a  State spends only 1.5 percent of its  total correctional budget on  inmate  education and training programs. Fur ther, corrections education programs  are generally plagued by  inadequate  funds, space, equipment, and trained  staff.  To make matters even worse,  the  lack of adequate education programs  is further complicated by the nature  of the prison population. As noted by  the National Advisory Council on Vo cational Education  in  its  excellent  report, Vocational Education in Cor rectional Institutions:  The typical inmate is a 25 year old male,  with an uncertain educational background,  limited marketable skills, and few positive  work experiences. He completed no more  than 10 high school grades and functions 2  to 3 grade levels below that. He is likely to  be poor, having earned less than $10,000 in  the year prior to his arrest.  Although the U.S. prison population is 96  percent male, the plight of the incarcerated  woman cannot be overlooked. She is typical ly under 30, a single mother with two or  more children, poor and on welfare. She is  likely to have problems with physical and/  or mental health, drugs and/or alcohol.  This  situation  does  not  improve  when a person is released from prison.  The unemployment rate among ex-of fenders is three times the rate for the  general public. Those that do find jobs  often work in low-income, semiskilled  positions. If they do not commit an other crime, many ex-felons end their  lives  in suicide or dereliction among  the skid row population. As Chief Jus tice Warren Burger put it so eloquent ly:  Ninety-five percent of the adults who are  presently confined in our nation's prisons  will eventually return to freedom. Without  any positive change, including learning mar ketable skills, a depressing number-prob ably more than half of these inmates-will  return to a life of crime after their release.  The situation is, in fact, even more  distressing than that described by the  Chief  Justice. Sixty  to  seventy-five  percent of the 150,000 offenders re leased from institutions each year will  return to crime, and 30 to 50 percent  will be recommitted to prison within 1  year. Among juveniles, the rate of re cidivism reaches as high as 80 percent.  In response to this deplorable set of  circumstances, the Chief Justice pro posed in his 1981 report to the Ameri can Bar Association the introduction  of mandatory educational and voca tional programs  for all  inmates. He  urged that every inmate who could not  read, write, spell, and do simple arith metic would be given that training. In  addition,  the Chief  Justice  recom mended a large expansion of vocation al  training  in  the skilled and semi skilled  crafts .. His  recommendations  were not only echoed but amplified  and expanded upon by the report of  the National Advisory Council on Vo cational Education  to which  I have  previously  ref erred.  That  report  should be required reading for every  public official in this country.  The Chief  Justice's  recommenda tions, combined with those of the Na tional Advisory Council on Vocational  Education, clearly point to the need  for a greater Federal commitment in  the corrections education area. To my  mind, their observations and findings  provide the strongest support possible  for the legislative initiative embodied  in this bill. In addition, they are but tressed by  the  results of studies  in  California, Maryland, New Mexico,  Texas, and Washington which corre late a reduction in the recidivism rate  to the education and training received  by the inmate while in prison.  Mr. President,  the Federal correc tional education assistance would au thorize $25 million a year in grants to  State education agencies. The size of a  grant would be determined by  the  ratio of a State's inmate population to  the  total  inmate population  in  all  States, but no State would receive less  than $100,000. The States would be  permitted great latitude in fashioning  programs to meet their own specific  needs and conditions. Funds could be  used for a variety of educational pro grams, including:  One, academic programs  for basic  education, special education, second ary school credit, postsecondary edu cation,  fine  arts,  recreation,  and  health.  Two, vocational training programs.  Three,  library development and li brary services.  Four, teacher training in correction al education, particularly in social edu cation, reading instruction, and abnor mal psychology.  Five, educational  release programs  for off enders with special attention on  vocational work release training pro grams.  Six,  guidance  programs,  including  testing, counseling, psychological eval qation, and placement services.  Seven, supportive servic.es, with spe cial emphasis upon job placement and  coordination of  educational  services  with other agencies furnishing services  to criminal off enders after their re lease.  Eight,  cooperative  programs with  private business and industry to pro vide both  job  training and employ ment opportunities for off enders.  Mr. President, this marks the third  time since 1979 that I have introduced  legislation of this nature. I am very  encouraged that this year the serious  situation which this bill addresses will  be the subject of a hearing to be con ducted in conjunction with the reau thorization hearings on the Vocational  Education Act. This is a significant de velopment, and I want to take this op",1983
43,Senate,98,0.322,678,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, on behalf  of myself and Senators HEFLIN  and  THURMOND, I am pleased to introduce  the Court Improvements Act of 1983.  The most significant of the reforms  included in the package is the creation  of an intercircuit tribunal to exercise  jurisdiction over cases ref erred to it by  the Supreme Court.  The purpose of the tribunal is to re lieve the dramatically increased work load of the Supreme Court. In recent  months,  in highly unusual  fashion,  eight  Justices  of  the Court  have  spoken publicly about the problem of  docket congestion. A few weeks ago,  the Chief Justice of the United States  specifically endorsed the creation of a  temporary intercircuit tribunal to help  alleviate the growing overload.  For  years,  judicial  commentators  and scholars have tracked the alarm ing rise in the number of cases before  the Court. In the Court's past session,  there were more than 6,000 petitions  for  certiorari,  an  increase of more  than 80 percent over the past 10 years.  Of  sheer  necessity,  an  increasing  number of  these  requests  for High  Court review were decided in summa ry, or per curiam fashion.  Almost 10  years ago,  the Hruska  Commission, which was established to  study  the Federal appellate system,  recommended that a national court of  appeals be created to serve as a safety  valve  for an  increasingly overloaded  and overworked Supreme Court.  In  the  intervening years,  the pressures  which  led  to  this  recommendation  have intensified and the Hruska pro posal has continued to receive interest  and support. In this and the past Con gress, Senator HEFLIN, the ranking mi nority member of the Courts Subcom mittee, has proposed the creation of a  permanent National Court of Appeals  along the lines recommended by the  Hruska Commission, and his well-rec ognized expertise in this area was in strumental in the development of this  intercircuit tribunal proposal.  The intercircuit tribunal can be an  important new tool to ease the alarm ing burdens on the Court.  The elements of  the proposal are  straight-forward: A  temporary court  would be created for a 5-year period to  settle important matters ref erred to it  by the Supreme Court. The proposal  follows  the recommendations of  the  Hruska Commission in that the tribu nal would have no original  jurisdic tion. It would decide only cases which  the Supreme Court ref erred to it by  majority vote. The Supreme Court  would retain the power to overrule or  modify any decision of the tribunal,  consistent with its constitutional role  as the highest court in the land.  The circuit council of each circuit  court of appeals would nominate two  judges to sit on the 26-member tribu nal. Five judge panels would then be  formed within  the  tribunal  to hear  and decide cases. No two judges from  the same circuit could sit on the same  panel. Judges would be designated to  sit on panels by a  lottery system in  such a way that all judges of the tribu nal would hear and decide cases that  represent all types of cases before the  tribunal.  The  legislation  also  incorporates  Senator HEFLIN's proposal to establish  a Chancellor of the United States who  would be appointed by the Chief Justice from among circuit judges in regu lar  active  service. The Chancellor  would be responsible for assisting the  Chief Justice with the ever increasing  administrative burdens of the position  of Chief Justice. He would also serve  as a member of the intercircuit tribu nal and be responsible for the adminis tration of that court.  Mr. President, this proposal consti tutes a balanced and cost-efficient re sponse to the Supreme Court's urgent  need  for  relief  from  its burgeoning  caseload. Because  the proposal does  not involve the creation of new judge ships, nor the establishment of a sepa rate administrative support structure,  its costs should be minimal. In addi tion, the temporary nature of the tri bunal should address the reservations  of some about creating a new appel late layer to the Federal court struc ture in the form of a permanent Na tional Court of Appeals. Rather, this  5-year  experiment will  provide  the  Congress with  needed  information  concerning the feasibility and wisdom  of  taking such a step. At the same  time, the tribunal will provide desper ately needed additional decisional ca pacity for  the resolution of disputes  where  nationwide  uniformity  is  needed, many of which are now left  unresolved  because  the  Supreme  Court cannot make room on its docket.  The remaining components of  this  court improvements package consist of  proposals which are similar or identi cal to bills which were introduced in  the last Congress. All were mentioned  in the year end report of the Chief  Justice as needed improvements in ju dicial administration.  First,  title  I would  eliminate  the  mandatory  jurisdiction  of  the  Su preme Court. Under current law, cer tain cases may be appealed directly to  the Supreme Court and the Court is  obligated  to hear and decide  them.  The majority of these cases do not in volve important issues, are summarily  dealt with, and essentially serve only  to clog the Court's docket.  Identical  proposals have passed at  least one  House of Congress in the past three  Congresses.  Title II would eliminate most civil  priorities. Over the past several years,  the Congress has enacted so many  statutory  provisions  requiring  the  courts to give expedited consideration  to certain civil cases, that they have  become virtually meaningless. Title II  would eliminate all  these  identified  priorities, except  for habeas corpus,  civil rights, and FOIA cases, and appli cations  for  temporary  restraining  orders or injunctions. A proposal virtu ally  identical  to  title  II passed  the  House last year as part of the Rails back court reform package.  Title  III would make certain  im provements to judicial survivor's bene fits to make them more comparable to  ",1983

""Pete"" Allen, Jr., who  was recently selected to be the chair man of the National Food Processors  Association at its 76th annual meeting  in Los Angeles earlier this month.  Although  the honor was a choice  one for Pete, who has spent his entire  life  in  the food processing business,  the honor also belongs  to the Allen  Canning Co. and to the entire State of  Arkansas. Pete is the first Arkansan in  the history of the association to serve  as chairman.  At this time, I am inserting in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, the article en titled, ""Allen: World's Largest Private  Canner, and Growing"" from the Janu ary issue of the publication entitled,  ""Processed Prepared Foods,"" which  documents the amazing Allen success  story.

45,,98,-0.49,743,3,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, Lincoln  University has a  rich and distinctive  history in the life of the State of Mis souri and our Nation.  It was founded as an institution of  higher education in 1866 to provide for  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the academic and intellectual develop ment of  the sons and daughters of  former  slaves.  Lincoln  University,  therefore, has a specialness in the very  lifeblood of black Americans because it  offers  through the provision of aca demic and intellectual skills a conduit  for black Americans to enter the socio economic mainstream of American so ciety.  To that extent, it is very dear and  much cherished by black Americans.  It is most important that this peculiar  heritage of Lincoln University and its  precious roots be maintained and ex tended in the present and future.  It should be noted as a matter of his torical record that Lincoln University  has always, as is true of other predom inantly black colleges and universi ties-namely, Howard, Morgan, Talla dega, Hampton, and so forth-founded  during  the same period, opened  its  doors to all races. Lincoln University  must  remain,  in  the  present  and  future, a vital and creative part of  black America.  In this connection, Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues  a  position  paper  prepared  by Dr.  Willie  J. Kimmons  regarding  the  maintenance of the heritage of Lin coln University.  The paper follows:  MAINTAINING THE HISTORICAL HERITAGE AND  INTEGRITY OF LINCOLN UNIVERSITY  <By Willie J. Kimmons>  According  to Randolph Bracy,  Jr.,  the  major goal of Black institutions of higher  learning is the development of strategies for  preparing Black people with the essential  skills to govern and compete in the Black  Community  and  the American  society.  (""The Black Private College and Strategies  for its Survival,"" Journal of Negro Educa tion, Vol XLIX, No. l, 1980.)  In 1866, shortly after the Civil War, a  group of Black men had a vision and saw a  need for a Black institution of higher learn ing in the Jefferson City, Missouri area. Be cause they had no financial backing they  decided  to contribute some of  their own  earnings. Thus in 1866, because members of  the 62nd and the 65th colored  infantries  had a vision and decided to contribute from  their personal earnins, Lincoln Institute was  created. This dream encouraged by other in dividuals became a reality and on Septem ber 17, 1866 Lincoln opened its doors for the  first time to Black students desiring a post high school education. Twenty four years  later, in 1890 the State of Missouri estab lished Lincoln as a land-grant institution of  higher  learning.  In 1921,  this  institution  became Lincoln University.  Since  its  inception,  this  institution has  broadened  the horizons of  thousands of  Black young men and women by helping  them  to  realize  their potential  to  fulfill  themselves, serve humanity, and stand-up in  support of the dignity of all persons. The  tradition upon which Lincoln University  was founded, nurtured and developed must  remain as strong and true today and tomor row as it was yesterday.  According to Dennis Daily Murphy, one of  the major goals of Black institutions is to  provide  creditable models  for  aspiring  youth. He stresses the importance of young  3467  Black men and Black women seeing other  Blacks managing important affairs and ad ministering  important  enterprises.  <""The  Future of Predominantly Black Public Col leges and Universities,"" Urban Education,  Vol. 16, No. 1, April, 1981.)  Faustine  Jones  emphasizes  that  since  their founding, the worth of Black Colleges  is very often substantiated by quantitative  measures such as the number of graduates.  From a quantitative perspective, most of the  teachers,  lawyers, physicians, social work ers, and other Black professionals who have  made significant contributions or who have  attained outstanding social distinction are  alumni of Black Colleges. (""In appreciation:  The Worth of Black Colleges"" Journal of  Negro Education, Vol. 50, No. 3, 1981.)  One of the outstanding strengths of Lin coln University  is  the pride and commit ment of  its  graduates. These  graduates  along with the faculty and staff are dedicat ed  to advancing excellence  in  the  liberal  arts,  in the professions, and technical ca reers. A few of  its outstanding graduates  are:  Mr. William Gillespie, National President,  Lincoln  University  Alumni  Association,  Chesterfield, Missouri.  Mr. Paul Thornton, Assistant Director, In ternal Revenue Service, Detroit Office, De troit, Michigan.  Mr. Jesse Hill, Jr., President, The Atlanta  Life Insurance Co., Atlanta, Georgia.  Mr. Thomas Shropshire, Vice President,  Miller Brewery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Dr. Henry Givens, President, Harris-Stowe  College, St. Louis, Missouri.  Mr. Stanley Scott, Vice President, Phillip  Morris, New York, New York.  Mrs. Barbara Vance, Staff Facilitator, Col lege of Education, Wayne State University,  Detroit, Michigan.  Dr. Lionel Newsome, President, Central  State University, Wilberforce, Ohio.  Mr. Earl Wilson, Marketing Director for  European Countries, I.B.M.  Dr. Queen Randall, President, El Centro  Community College, Dallas, Texas.  Dr. Odell Nails, Superintendent, Pontiac  Public Schools, Pontiac, Michigan.  Mr.  Julius Hollis, Corporate Attorney,  General Motors, Detroit, Michigan.  Dr. Roy Cheatham, Dean, St. Louis Uni versity, St. Louis, Missouri.  Lincoln University graduates have distin guished themselves across this nation. Lin coln has produced and will  continue  to  produce some of the greatest role-models  and  image-builders  this  country has  to  offer. It has graduated some of the greatest  minds that have competed and contributed  at all levels and in every facet of American  life. Indeed the Alumni Association is en gaged in many exemplary efforts promoting  excellence in education and in maintaining  the University's historical integrity, person al, and professional growth throughout its  local chapters in more than 20 cities across  the United States of America. The Associa tion will continue  to support the mission  and goals of the institution and will contin ue their dedication to educating Black stu dents,  to all young people,  and  to our  nation.  Historically Black Universities  such  as  Lincoln provide opportunities for Black men  and women with advanced degrees to find  positions to teach and administer in a more  congenial and more comfortable settings.  According to Andrew Billingsley, among the  nation's more than three thousand predomi nantly white colleges and universities, less  than one percent of the faculties are Black.  ",1983
46,Senate,98,-0.598,756,3,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on  December 7, 1982, an article on the nu clear  freeze  resolutions now before  Congress, entitled ""Cold, Hard Facts  on the Freeze,"" appeared in the Wash ington Post. This piece was written by  the Honorable Congressman ALBERT  GoRE, JR., of Tennessee. This provoca tive, penetrating look at the nuclear  freeze issue deserves this body's atten tion, and I encourage my colleagues to  take the time to consider Congressman  GoRE's views.  ""Cold, Hard Facts on the Freeze"" is  an article  that clearly demonstrates  the futility in this Congress assuming  a negative role on the Reagan adminis tration's policies  toward  the Soviet  Union. ""What looms ahead for Con gress,"" Congressman GoRE writes, ""is a  protracted struggle over the future of  nuclear weapons,  on  a  system-by system basis, without benefit of any  common  framework  for  evaluating  each one and debating its merits in re lation to an agreed national strategic  plan.""  This  is a sizable challenge  indeed,  but it is a challenge that we must meet  as  soon  as  possible.  Congressman  GoRE's article could prove useful  in  setting this new course.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the article be printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  COLD, HARD FACTS ON THE FREEzE  (By ALBERT GORE, Jr.)  During the next two years, Congress, and  the House in particular, is likely to be the  scene of a major crisis in our nation's de fense policy. Enormous federal deficits will  demand major  reductions  in government  spending. Those cuts are not all going to  come out of social programs, and therefore  many will come out of the military budget.  ,And in the military budget, nothing is more  visible  and vulnerable  than  the nuclear  weapons program: big-ticket  items whose  value  to  the national  security has been  sharply challenged by  the nuclear freeze  movement.  Among the nuclear weapons program, the  one with  the least chance for survival  is  clearly the MX missile. But there are al ready indications that other programs, in cluding the Pershing II missile for NATO  and, very likely, the Bl, again, will be chal lenged. Other programs,  including cruise  missiles  and  the Trident D5  submarine launched missile, have their critics too, but  are not as  likely-for  the  time being, at  least-to be at the center of controversy <al though even this judgment may have to be  modified,  in  the case of ground-launched  cruise missiles for Europe).  We can expect President Reagan to show  very little flexibility  in this area. He will  insist that the country requires all  these  weapons systems, and he will charge that if  Congress refuses to fund them, it must take  responsibility for weakening the national se curity, diminishing Soviet interest in arms  control,  and  ultimately,  increasing  the  hazard of war.  Proponents of the freeze reject this logic,  and are likely to have enough votes in the  next Congress to ensure that Reagan's argu ments for major nuclear weapons programs  across the board are rejected.  This having been done, however, members  of Congress will then have to face the hard  facts  that < 1) Reagan will not adopt the  freeze programs as his own, because to do so  would require him to abjure everything he  believes about dealing with the Soviets; (2)  funding decisions for nuclear weapons pro grams will have to be taken by Congress  without benefits of an arms control frame work; <3> new or modified Soviet nuclear  weapons systems will continue  to appear  and  to move  toward deployment, and <4>  public opinion, which has been inspired to  doubt the value of nuclear superiority, has  never lost its repugnance for conceding it to  the Soviet Union by unilateral actions.  What looms ahead for Congress,  there fore, is a protracted struggle over the future  of nuclear, weapons, on a system-by-system  basis, without  benefit  of  any  common  framework for evaluating each one and de bating its merits in relation to an agreed na tional strategic plan.  The president's philosophy will not serve  for this purpose, but neither will that of the  freeze movement. On  the day after  the  House  passes  a  resolution  affirming  its  desire for a mutual, bilateral freeze with the  Soviet Union, it must nevertheless continue  to decide the fate of U.S. nuclear weapons  in the absence of such an agreement, or  even of the hope for one while Reagan is in  office.  Congressional advocates of a  freeze will  face an especially painful dilemma. A pat tern of votes against nuclear weapons programs adds up to unrequited concessions to  the Soviet Union. But a pattern of votes in  favor of such weapons adds up to approval  of a process  that will  rapidly erode  the  freeze as a viable policy for a future admin istration.  What we lack today, and what the next  Congress will urgently need, is a standard  that will  help us  reach better-informed  judgments as to what kind of nuclear pos ture we should have, as to what kinds of nu clear weapons programs are compatible with  that posture, and as to how these decisions  affect the stability of the nuclear balance  and prospects for reaching an agreement  with the Soviets.  Two months ago, I joined with Reps. Les  Aspin, Thomas Downey, and Joel Pritchard  to introduce a  resolution suggesting what  this standard ought to be.  The United States and the Soviet Union  are heading  toward a situation  in which  each will have the ability to menace a sig nificant  portion  of  the  other's nuclear  forces; specifically, the land-based ICBMs,  which are the most accurate and in many  ways the premier weapons systems.  Our response to the ICBM vulnerability  problem has been the development of two  new generations of ballistic missiles:  the  MX, for depolyment on land, and the Tri dent II D5, for deployment at sea. Each will  mark an increase in the number and accura cy of U.S. ballistic missile warheads, such  that either system, and certainly the two to gether, will constitute a threat to all Soviet  ICBM silos.  The increasing vulnerability of U.S. land based forces, and the coming vulnerability  of Soviet land-based forces, are trends that  are fraught with danger. Mutual fear of a  first strike is highly destabilizing and mark edly increases the risk of nuclear war, while  putting at risk any prospect for meaningful  arms control.  Congress should recognize this fear of a  first strike as the central issue in judging  whether existing deployments are adequate,  for deciding what new deployments make  sense, and for assessing whether arms con trol  is on the right  track. In the highly  charged tension between the U.S. and the  U.S.S.R.,  even  a  hypothetical  advantage  gained by striking first is dangerous and de stabilizing, because  it generates  fear and  raises the specter of political intimidation.  Our resolution states that, as part of the  strategic  arms  reduction  negotiations  CST ART>.  the United  States  and  the  U.S.S.R.:  < 1) Should place the highest priority on  efforts to reduce and eliminate the fear by  either  nation  of  a  nuclear  first  strike  against it by the other.  <2> Should seek a verifiable agreement  that produces stability in the strategic rela tionship between the two nations by ensur ing  that a nuclear first strike would not  confer upon the attacking nation even a hy pothetical advantage.  To grasp this framework and apply it, the  president need not repudiate his view of the  world, but rather, modify and refine it. In  theory,  the next Congress might seek  to  bind the president to freeze measures by  threatening  to block major spending bills  until he gives in. I hope we will avoid that  kind of confrontation, but to do so requires  the development of a bipartisan consensus  on the nuclear problem, rather than polar ization of the debate.  The freeze resolution, which I have sup ported, states an ideal we are not going to  see realized, or even pursued, by the present  ",1983
47,Senate,98,-0.382,782,3,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased today to join as a cospon sor of Senate Resolution 77 offered by  my distinguished colleague from New  York, Senator D'AMATo. Senate Reso lution 77 will deny  the deferral of  funding for much-needed assistance to  our Nation's mass transit capital facili ties. These funds are of critical impor tance to my State of New Jersey and  other States which are dependent on  mass transit for their economic well being.  In the gas tax legislation passed by  the Congress and signed by the Presi dent, mass transit was to receive 1 cent  of  the 5-cent  increase  in  revenues.  This was an  important victory  for  mass  transit  and  a  credit  to  the  wisdom of the Senate. It was also a  tribute  to the efforts of the Senate  Committee on Banking and Urban Af fairs, its chairman Senator GARN and  its  entire  membership.  Senator  D' AMATO worked particularly hard to  insure that mass  transit capital and  operating needs received the attention  they deserve.  Yet, it was not long before the ad ministration moved to impose substan tial cuts in mass transit, far out of pro portion to any other surface transpor tation reductions. Should this be al lowed to happen, mass transit's victory  of last year will have been a brief and  bitter one indeed.  Again, I join my esteemed colleague  in his effort  to  restore  these badly  needed funds.   NOTICES OF HEARINGS  COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET  Mr. DOMENIC!.

50,House,98,-0.173,821,3,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman,  the Committee on  Science  and Technology  joins  the  Committee on Education and Labor in  supporting H.R.  1310,  proposing  a  broad and comprehensive bill to deal  with what has been termed a crisis in  science  and math  education. H.R.  1310, while comprehensive in nature is  not seen by either committee as a solu tion to all the problems confronting  our educational system  today  in sci ence, math, engineering, and technolo gy. Rather it should be viewed as a  first  step-although  an  important  one-in a series of steps to be taken  collaboratively by the Federal Govern ment with State and  local govern ments,  academia,  business  and  the  other elements of the concerned pri vate  sector. True  resolution of  the  problems will  require  a  protracted  effort on everyone's part  to  reverse  the present trends of our educational  system and meet our human resource  needs of tomorrow.  Chairman,  both  committees  have had extensive hearings on  the  issue of science and math education  and its impact on the Nation's trained  technical, engineering or scientific per sonnel. The Science Committee held  five series of hearings in the last Con gress as well as a final set of hearings  in this Congress. The last day, in fact,  we heard from over 20 witnesses repre senting industry, academia, State and  local governments and various prof es sional and educational groups and so cieties. In addition, dozens of confer ences, meetings, and colloquiums have  been held  throughout  the  country  with sponsors including the National  Academy of Sciences,  the American  Association  for  the Advancement of  Science,  the National Association of  Manufacturers, the American AssociaMr.  and  Societies  tion  of  Engineering  many others.  Let me note here a few of the facts  and  ideas we have heard  resulting  from these oversight and investigative  activities:  Fifty percent of new  science and  math teachers at the secondary school  level are unqualified  to  teach  those  subjects.  Fewer than 30 percent of the Na tion's high schools require more than  1 year of science and math.  There currently exists a 9-percent  shortage of engineering faculty at just  the time when engineering course en rollments are increasing.  Overcrowding of classrooms, lack of  advanced  instructional and  research  instrumentation, as well as noncom petitive salaries are attracting young  engineering  faculty  and  instructors  out of the university and into indus try.  Fewer American  engineering  stu dents are entering graduate level pro grams to create the next generation of  teachers and researchers in this area.  To put it another way, we are eating  our  ""seed  corn""-and  that  ""seed  corn"" -our teachers and  instructors,  our researchers and engineers-will be  critical  to  this Nation's future well being.  As the President recently recognized  in his second state of the Union ad dress:  Education,  training  and  retraining  are  fundamental to our success as are research,  development,  and  productivity  . . . We  Americans are still the world's technological  leader in most fields. We must keep that  edge, and to do so we need to begin renew ing the basics-starting with our education al system.  I believe we all agree on the need as  we stand here today. As I have noted,  the problems are quite extensive, un derscoring the need for quick action.  In  the 97th Congress, over 40 bills  were  introduced,  but  none  were  passed. I believe Members who have  studied this problem are now prepared  to act.  The bill before us today represents  the culmination of almost 2 years of  effort by numerous  individuals both  here  in Congress and from outside.  Again, it is not intended to be a single  answer to the complex issue confront ing us. Rather, it is a start in the proc ess.  Let me briefly mention  the high lights of the Science Committee's ac tions and recommendations as report ed for consideration on the floor. As  already noted by my distinguished col league from Kentucky, the chairman  of the Education and Labor Commit tee, Congressman CARL PERKINS, H.R.  1310 has two parts, title I-the ""Engi neering Mathematics and Science Edu cation and Jobs Act"" and title II-the  ""National Engineering  and  Science  Personnel Act of 1983."" The elementary and secondary portion of title I was  considered  solely by  the Education  Committee; the other portions of title  I  jointly by our two committees; and  title II solely by the Science Commit tee.  In the title I activities considered by  the Science Committee we found our selves in agreement with the Educa tion Committee as to the actual activi ties to be taken, although there were  some changes  in responsibilities and  resources allocated between  the De partment of Education and  the Na tional Science Foundation. These in cluded:  A special national teacher incentive  scholarship program  to be adminis tered by the Department for providing  new elementary and secondary math  and critical foreign language teachers.  A special national teacher incentive  scholarship program  to be  adminis tered by the Department for providing  new elementary and secondary math  teachers, and teachers of critical for eign language.  Summer institutes and workshops to  be operated by both the foundation  and the Department aimed at improv ing teaching skills.  Postsecondary mathematics, science,  and foreign language improvement at  institutions of higher education; and  investigations of effective educational  methods and programs.  In title II the major thrust is two fold. One, to establish a clear policy as  to the Federal role in maintaining an  adequate supply of properly qualified  technical,  engineering and  scientific  personnel. Second, to establish a spe cial matching  fund administered by  the National Science Foundation. This  cost-sharing fund would focus on the  following:  Recruitment and retention of new  engineering faculty.  Two-year and community college, as  well as  four-year  institution  faculty  development in high technology and  scientific fields.  Instructional  Instrumentation with  special emphasis on computer accessi bility in post secondary institutions.  Precollege science programs includ ing the use of industrial personnel and  resources in education programs; and  the promotion of public understanding  of science and mathematics.  The funding level in title I as report ed by our committee was $325 million  for fiscal year 1984; in title II $100 mil lion per year is authorized for a 5-year  period beginning in fiscal year 1984.  The total amount in fiscal year 1984  would be $425 million.  Although $425 million  is a  lot of  money, I would note that the Nation  now spends over $200 billion annually  for our public education enterprise.  The $425 million is less than one-quar ter of 1 percent of $200 billion. Given  the crisis we have all acknowledged as  ",1983
51,House,98,0.254,834,3,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to commend the chairmen  and members of the Committees on  Science and Technology and Educa tion and Labor for the work they have  done on H.R. 1310,  the Emergency  Mathematics and Science Education  Act. I join my colleagues in support of  the concepts and  intended goals of  H.R. 1310. This  legislation will not  solve all of our problems, but it is an  important effort by the Congress  to  provide leadership and to put a nation al  focus  on  the need  for qualified  teachers. Until we as a nation recog nize the importance of teachers in our  children's  lives, and pay  them com mensurately,  the problems with em ploying and  retaining  teachers who  can inspire students to learn will con tinue. The pay issue must, of course,  be addressed at the State and  local  level, but I hope that passage of this  legislation today will serve to empha size how serious we  think  the prob lems are.  During the past decade the United  States has experienced a serious de cline  in  the quality of education  in  mathematics and science. Most alarm ing to me was an article in the March  1982 issue of Education Week indicat ing that since 1972 there has been a  77-percent decline  in  the number of  secondary-level mathematics teachers  prepared in 600  teacher-training pro grams nationwide. Among newly em ployed science and mathematics teach ers, 50.2 percent were judged by princi pals  to be unqualified  to  teach  in  those fields but had been employed on  an emergency basis because school of ficials could not find qualified teach ers.  This shortage of mathematics and  science  teachers hampers the ability  of the schools to provide the quality  curriculum and  instruction so neces sary to academic achievement. During  an age of technological advances, it is  incumbent upon us to provide our stu dents with the necessary skills to com pete in today's society. I think this leg islation we are considering here today  is an important first step which could  well determine this country's leader ship role as we advance into the 21st  century. I urge my colleagues to sup port H.R. 1310 because I feel that in  order to achieve academic excellence  tomorrow, we must make a commit ment to education today.  0 1445  ",1983

54,House,98,0.268,834,3,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Chairman, we do  indeed  face  a  crisis  in  science and  math education. And I do believe that  H.R.  1310 makes  a  good  first-step  effort.  Speaking as a former scientist, engi neering professor, former member of  the Science and Technology Commit tee, someone who has been deeply con cerned  in his own district with  this  question of better math and science  education, I see H.R. 1310 as a major  effort to increase the flow of science  and math  teachers  in  the pipeline;  that is,  to educate,  to  train, and  to  make available, I think H.R. 1310 goes  a long way. It makes a yeoman effort.  But the problem is going to occur at  the other end of the pipeline. Once  the teachers are prepared, will the op portunity  be  there  in  a way  that  people can provide for their families in  somewhat similar fashion  than  they  can do were they to work in the pri vate sector?  I submit that that question is not  yet addressed. In reponse to a previous  statement, we are not in a postindus trial age; we are in a new  industrial  age. We will continue to build cars, we  will continue  to make steel, we will  continue  to produce chemicals. This.  country is not to be turned into one  large Silicon Valley where everybody  is making Ataris.  Incidentally, Atari  just shipped 1,700 jobs to Taiwan and  Hong Kong. No;  it  is  the  infusion  throughout America of new  technol ogies. And  the prime  sponsors  are  going  to be  those able  to  teach  in  these areas.  I  submit  that opportunities, once  they are  through  the pipeline, once  H.R. 1310 and the system has worked  its will, that opportunity will not be  there if the market forces for talent  are being repressed. The teacher re cruitment and  retention problem  is  largely a matter of economics. Here  are some  interesting aspects of  the  problem.  In a recent study by James Guthrie,  chairman of the School of Education  at University of California the author  noted that the dramatic shortage of  mathematics and science teachers may  doom the United States to a ""second  rate"" future in high technology. The  author noted  that private  industry  offers more  lucrative pay  to people  qualified to teach math and science.  For example in the San Francisco Bay  area,  starting  teachers earn $12,680  while  private  industry  likely would  pay them $20,000, the report said.  The report suggested five tactics for  fighting the high school brain drain in  technical fields. One of the five recom mendations was  to allow  schools  to  off er higher pay  for  these  higher  demand fields.  In Houston  teachers with  critical  skills, such as science and math teach ers will be paid bonuses of $2,000 a  year. If they agree  to  teach  in the  poorer neighborhoods they receive an  additional $2,000. And if they teach in  a school where test scores rise above  the anticipated norm, they get an ad ditional $1,300.  This has  led  to an extremely  low  number of vacancies in these areas in  the city of Houston. Only four vacan cies in math and science.  Many  teachers  are  drifting  away  toward industry at this point and ac cording to Henry Tunis, research di rector  of  the National Council  of  Teachers of Mathematics  it will get  worse as economic recovery progresses.  At that point he notes potential sci ence and math  teachers will  find  it  easier and more rewarding to go into  industry.  Herman L. Carter, personnel super visor for  the Richmond, Va. schools  noted that he received over 300 appli cants for teaching positions after of fering a $1,500 bonus. He noted:  It used to be in some cases that you'd hire  the only  (science) applicant who applied.  Now for the first time we have the opportu nity to pick from them.  In Oklahoma City  the school sys tem's personnel chief is offering math  and science teachers $500 plus an addi tional $100 for each credit hour they  teach. And the result has been an im provement in the situation.  And I know this is a touchy political  situation. Every school administrator,  in fact, many teachers whom I spoke  with back in my district, recognize it  as a touchy situation. But they all rec ognize  that a physics  teacher or a  mathematics teacher does command a  different rate of return and something  has to be done.  The CHAIRMAN.

61,,98,-0.496,964,3,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am reintroducing legislation,  by request, which would amend the In ternal W.evenue Code of 1954 to pro vide a $30 refundable tax credit to tax payers who vote in a Federal general  elections.  The concept of a voting tax credit is  the brainchild of Mr. Frank Martino,  president of the International Chemi cal Workers Union.  It  proposes  a  voting tax credit as a method to get  more Americans out to vote in Federal  elections. According to the ICWU, the  credit is ""designed to provide an incen tive for all Americans, rich and poor  alike, to exercise their franchise as re sponsible citizens of our country.""  Mr. Speaker, the low percentage of  voter turnout in Federal elections has  become a deplorable situation in this  country. Apathy on the part of eligible  voters has soared, and lately we have  seen trends which indicate that many  Americans do not vote simply because  they are  frustrated with politicians.  More and more Americans seem to be lieve that their vote is not really im portant any more.  The extent of voter alienation is ap parent  in statistics  released by  the  Census Bureau. These figures are dis heartening as well as alarming. In the  1968 Presidential election, there was a  60.9 percent voter turnout. In the 1972  election,  after  18-year-olds  got  the  vote, voter  turnout dropped  to 55.6  percent. And in the latest Presidential  election,  only  53.2  percent  of  the  American population eligible  to vote  participated. The  figures  are  even  more alarming for off-year elections.  In 1970 there was a 43.5-percent turn out compared to 35.5 percent in 1978with a population increase of 21 per cent.  March 2, 1983  The nationwide  decline  in voting  should be of serious concern to anyone  who believes in democracy. One of our  basic freedoms as American citizens is  to choose our public officials through  the election process. Then if we are  not satisfied with those in office, we  can make changes by exercising our  right to vote. Those who cite disillu sionment or disgust with the system as  their reason for not casting a ballot  are simply perpetuating the situation  they dislike. We cannot stand back. It  is  time  for all Americans  to  realize  that our votes do count, and we must  do  something  to  encourage  eligible  voters to participate.  The voting tax credit is one way to  encourage eligible voters to take the  time to vote. Taxpayers who vote in a  Federal general election-or the equiv alent thereto-will receive the credit $60  for a  joint return-by attaching  their  ballot  stub  to  their Federal  income  tax  return.  In  those States  where a ballot stub  is not used,  a  stamp or other document which is evi dence of voting will be issued.  Critics of a voting tax credit argue  that increased voter turnout does not  guarantee  an  improvement  in  the  quality of  legislators being  elected.  Certainly there is some merit to that  argument, but we have to examine the  overall picture. We all have to work  for  improved voter  turnout, but we  also have  to help educate voters so  that they can cast a responsible vote.  I think we owe it to the country to  give this proposal our attention.   POETS ON A COFFEE BREAK  HON. RONALD V.

63,,98,-0.293,977,3,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  com mend to you and our colleagues the  following  editorial on  the need  for  campaign finance reform, written by  Mark Shields,  the Washington Post,  February 25, 1983.  As a  long time proponent of cam paign finance reform, I believe that we  must move  speedily  on  this  issue,  before the public's confidence in this  institution is completely destroyed by  the events Mr. Shields very correctly  warns cannot be far off.  THE COMING CAMPAIGN SCANDAL  An unconditional prediction: a new federal  campaign  finance  law-one  that  imposes  severe limits on all political action commit tees and provides for some form of public fi nancing of congressional elections-will be  enacted within the next 24 months. While a  majority in Congress and the president now  3701  almost surely oppose any such law, their re sistance will  be overwhelmed by  future  public events. A major political money scan dal will be uncovered that will guarantee  passage of the laws.  All congresses respond to crisis. The crimi nal excesses of Watergate, particularly in  the illegal raising and spending of campaign  funds, probably made  full disclosure and  public funding of presidential campaigns in evitable. We and Congress will learn, sooner  rather  than  later, of another <probably  more than one) major political money scan dal. Once again, promising careers will be  ruined, prison sentences will be handed out  and Congress will pass and the president  will sign a tough new campaign finance law.  Able and committed politicians  in both  parties see the problem clearly. Bob Teeter,  the Republican pollster whose 1976 strategy  brought President Ford from a deficit of 16  million votes to within an eyelash of victory  in 11 weeks, is worried by the rivers of cam paign money now drowning American poli tics: ""It's just like 1972,"" he says. ""There's  too much money around not to have a scan dal."" Missouri Democratic Sen. Tom Eagle ton, who has been winning statewide races  since 1960, argues that contemporary politi cal fund-raising is ""a national scandal"" that  ""is taking place every day."" New York Rep.  Barber Conable, the ranking Republican on  the House Ways and Means Committee, sees  the ever-growing public perception of scan dal in present fund-raising practices as pro ducing more pressure for public financing of  elections. Conable, who  refuses campaign  contributions of more than $50, compares  the existing system of candidates' dunning  all who represent interests before the House  for contributions to his days in private law  practice, when judges running for reelection  raised their compaign budgets by ""putting  the arm on all of us lawyers who appeared  before their court.""  Public financing will not be entirely un welcome. Most candidates would,  if given  the alternative, choose root canal work over  asking anyone for money. Most of the cur rent resistance  to public financing comes  from the Republicans, many of whom, after  telling us  there is no connection between  contributions  and  a  congressman's vote,  then  remind us  that ""there  is  no  free  lunch,"" that every program has a price tag.  Apparently altruism only applies to contri butions by political action committees. But  it will probably make little difference what  anyone argues, because a major scandal will  end the debate and move the previous ques tion.e  RULES  OF  PROCEDURE  AND  STATEMENT  OF  POLICY  ON  PRIVATE IMMIGRATION BILLS  HON.

Presi dent Reagan pledged, in his recent Ameri can Legion speech, ""to explore all possibili ties for reconciliation and peace in Central  America."" It is a tall order, and he has yet  to deliver on it.  The Post is hardly alone in calling  for a political settlement in El Salva dor through means including negotiaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tions. Most of our country's major  newspapers-including  the Christian  Science Monitor,  the  Los Angeles  Times, the New York Times, and the  Miami Herald-have endorsed a politi cal route to a settlement in El Salva dor in recent editorials.  These and other editorials reflect a  growing  domestic  and  international  consensus. As chairman of the Sub committee  on Western Hemisphere  Affairs, I have had occasion to meet  with and hear testimony from a great  many of our country's Latin America  experts, and they are virtually unani mous that a political settlement is the  only way out for us in El Salvador. In  the same capacity, I have also traveled  frequently and widely throughout the  region, and it is unquestionably  the  opinion  of  our  democratic  friends  there that we should be seeking a po litical settlement of the war.  No one  is arguing that we should  pull out, or cut and run, or whatever  the administration's current rhetoric  accuses us of wanting. What they do  argue is that our strategy for involve ment  is  fundamentally  flawed. Our  friends  in Latin America want us to  work constructively for a stable, demo cratic El Salvador, an outcome that  cannot be achieved with our current  policy. They do not want us  to go  down with a rapidly sinking ship.  Mr. Speaker, I include at this point a  sampling of recent editorials on this  subject:  .  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 19831  MORE Am FOR EL SALVADOR?  More aid for El Salvador, as the Reagan  administration requests? Of course. It is an  $80-million-a-year war-that's  the amount  sent la.st year and sought next year. This  year, the foreign aid bill collapsed, leaving  El Salvador short $60 million. Not to pony it  up would probably finish off the govern ment. Is that what the Congress wants or is  ready to take the responsibility for?  The trouble is that the administration and  its critics are drawing divergent conclusions  from the condition that has launched this  latest argument, the sagging of the Salva doran war effort. The administration would  bull through its program of financing the  war <while sending more advisers), trying to  edge  forward  reforms and human  rights,  and cosponsoring  the  local government's  plan to draw the opposition into its electoral  scheme. The doubters fear the bottom  is  dropping out. They urge an effort to save  the American investment by promoting ne gotiations, talks, ""dialogue.""  They  are  right.  The  administration  equates  talks with  letting  the guerrillas  ""shoot their way into power."" But a little  perspective  is  in order. The generals who  are now on top shot their way in. Granted,  at American prodding they have devolved  uncertain power on a body elected since. If  full power had actually been taken by the  body elected a year ago, the administration  would have had fits, since a  feudal party  won. The  point  of  government-guerrilla  talks, their State Department advocates say,  is not to distribute power arbitrarily but to  shape democratic political processes.  It's  certainly  risky.  Increasingly,  it  looks  like  the only alternative.  3727  Secretary of State George Shultz's atti tude is puzzling. He was questioned in the  Senate on the calls for dialogue emanating  from Salvador's acting archbishop and from  Pope John Paul II, whose visit to Salvador  next Sunday is eagerly anticipated by parti sans of reconciliation. Mr. Shultz replied  with a reference to ""churchmen who want  to see Soviet influence in El Salvador im proved."" Separately, he was asked  if the  United States would actively oppose govern ment-guerrilla negotiations even if the Sal vadoran  government were  interested.  ""I  wouldn't think it would be a good idea,"" the  secretary said.  President Reagan pledged,  in his recent  American Legion speech, ""to explore all pos sibilities for reconciliation and peace in Cen tral America."" It is a tall order, and he has  yet to deliver on it.  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 19831  THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR  The military news in El Salvador is the  guerrillas' capture and holding for two days  of Berlin, population 35,000, a city in an in terior province remote from  their strong holds  near  the Honduran  border. Most  American observers have reacted cautiously,  aware perhaps of the exaggerated response  to the communists' Tet offensive  in Viet nam. Still, Berlin was a serious embarrass ment to the government. The guerrillas, re lying on ambushes, sabotage and intimida tion, do not seem to be near a country-wide  military victory. Nor is there evidence that  they have developed a mass following. But  their pressure is constant and perhaps grow ing, and neither  in San Salvador nor  in  Washington  are  the  authorities  certain  what to do.  Some  of  the Salvadoran  government's  probleins are familiar: Nicaragua continues  to augment the guerrillas locally obtained  arins. The Reagan administration has not  gotten from Congress all the military aid it  has sought. Other probleins arise directly  within El Salvador.  The Salvadoran armed forces had a year,  1982,  to use  their new American aid and  training  to  turn the corner, and did not.  They have been slow to adopt the aggres sive, small-unit patrols their American ad visers feel are best suited to routing guerril las. The Americans favor reform, but now  say the armed forces have been ""distracted""  by politics (pushing land reform> and politi cal infighting. Others note that Salvadoran  commanders, uncertain of their troops, have  preferred  the  safer  tactic  of  large-unit  sweeps, and that the government has been  spread thin by having to defend economic  targets.  Some officers have political associations  on the feudal right. One of them, much ad mired by  the Americans  for his military  record, Col: Sigfredo Ochoa,  last month  challenged the reform-minded chief of staff  in what Georgetown University's Robert  Leiken aptly calls an episode pitting ""the  Americans' darling against their right-hand  man.""  There is a sense of a new turning point.  The Americans nervously ask for ""a more  dynamic approach"" by the Salvadorans and  the  transfer of American  advisers  from  training  to  brigade-level  operations. Mr.  Leiken suggests that anti-communist mili tary groups  in El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras and  the Nicaraguan opposition  may join and launch their own combined re gional offensive.  ",1983

MIKE SYNAR  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 2, 1983  e ",1983
67,,98,-0.321,1016,3,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing legislation to curb un necessary bankruptcies without deny ing bankruptcy  relief  to consumers  who need the ""fresh start"" the bank ruptcy system is designed to provide.  Personal  bankruptcies  have  risen  dramatically  since  the Bankruptcy  Code became effective on October 1,  1979. Three years later bankruptcies  continue to run at an annual rate of  about 450,000, or 200 percent of the  rate for the 12 years prior to enact ment of the code. This rise is inexpli cable, even when coupled with high in terest rates, inflation, unemployment  and  increased  public  awareness  of  bankruptcy from lawyer advertising.  Economic conditions cannot account  for the many debtors who have been  counseled to discharge all of their debt  in a  straight chapter 7 bankruptcy  when they might easily have complet ed repayment of such debts in a court  supervised chapter 13 program.  Some experts believe that as much  as $1 billion of the $6 bi!lion scheduled  in bankruptcy annually is unnecessar ily discharged and can be paid by debt ors without hardship. This $1 billion is  being  paid  by  other  consumers  through higher prices and limitations  on credit availability.  There  is a virtual consensus  that  help is needed. The only question is  how. The legislation I am introducing  today presents a firm middle ground  between the two approaches already  introduced in the 98th Congress: H.R.  1147 by Congressman PETER RODINO  and H.R.  1169  by Congresswoman  MARILYN LLOYD BOUQUARD. Both are  good  bills  that  address  important  problems facing the consumer credit  industry; I believe my bill is a sound  compromise that addresses these prob lems thoroughly while protecting the  vast majority  of  consumer  debtors  who  need  and  deserve  bankruptcy  relief. I am pleased that my Judiciary  Committee  colleagues  Congressmen  BARNEY FRANK, HAL SAWYER, and BILL  McCoLLUM have joined with me today  as cosponsors,  along with Congress men GILLIS  LONG, BUTLER DERRICK,  DICK GEPHARDT, BILL GRAY, VIC FAZIO,  TRENT LoTT, BILL EMERSON, and HAL  DAUB.  March 2, 1983  Our legislation builds upon a hear ing record formed  in the 97th Con gress. In 1981 a consumer bankruptcy  reform bill was introduced which con tained several provisions to modify the  bankruptcy process.  It contained  a  provision which would have allowed a  creditor to challenge the eligibility of  a consumer debtor to take chapter 7  relief based on an ability to pay test. I  did not cosponsor that measure, be lieving another approach could curb  unnecessary bankruptcies while better  protecting  the  rights  of  deserving  debtors.  Our legislation achieves this goal by  following the suggestions of the final  report of  the National Bankruptcy  Commission  that  consumer  debtors  seeking bankruptcy relief be counseled  as to their options before selecting a  chapter 7 straight bankruptcy or a  chapter  13  repayment  plan.  I  am  keenly aware of  the  importance of  credit in the daily lives of millions of  consumers and believe that counseling  debtors may prevent their jeopardiz ing  their  future  ability  to  obtain  credit. As  the National Bankruptcy  Commission, among others, has noted,  debtors often  find  themselves  in a  straight  bankruptcy without  being  aware of the repayment alternative.  Mr. Speaker, our bill also grants a  court the authority, on its own motion  and only on its own motion, to abstain  from or dismiss a chapter 7 proceeding  where to permit it to continue would  constitute an abuse of the Bankruptcy  Code. When this was first brought to  my attention I was shocked to learn  that courts cannot now stop a bank ruptcy  proceeding  even when  the  judge is convinced the relief sought is  unnecessary. This provision is an alter native to the highly criticized thresh old  test or future  income  test con tained in other legislation. Our inten tion  is  to protect consumer debtors  from routine harassment which some  feared could result from the threshold  test, which gave creditors a  formal  procedure by which to challenge chap ter 7 proceedings, while at the same  time helping to curb abuse of chapter  7 relief.  Our bill gives creditors no  formal  procedure. Rather, the court alone de cides. If a creditor does seek to raise  the issue at any point in the proceed ing, the bankruptcy judge is under no  obligation  to hear or consider  the  creditor's motion or petition. It may  be dismissed without comment or con sideration and  the creditor has no  right to appeal. Therefore, the credi tor has no means of bringing any pres sure on the judge to exercise his dis cretion and no means of putting any  pressure on the debtor not to pursue a  chapter 7 straight bankruptcy. Fur ther, creditors who do seek to harass  debtors by filing superfluous motions  or petitions would be subject to all the  ",1983
68,Senate,98,0.508,1068,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  in 1968, Congress authorized the con struction of the Dallas Creek project,  Colorado River Basin Project Act,  Public Law 90-537. In November 1976,  the definite plan report for the project  was completed. The repayment con tract was approved in late 1976 at an  election of the residents of the Tri County Water Conservancy District,  the contracting and marketing  local  governmental agency for the project.  In January 1977,  the contract was  signed by the Department of Interior  and the Conservancy District. In Sep tember  1977,  the Commissioner  of  Reclamation authorized  the start of  construction.  Thus,  final designs  and  specifica tions for stage I were not completed  until mid-1979.  Due to dam safety design consider ations prompted by the Teton Dam  failure, the Bureau of Reclamation de cided to proceed with construction in  two phases. Invitations for bids on the  first  phase were  not  issued  until  August 1979. In tum, a contract was  not awarded to the successful bidder  until December  1979,  the Bureau  having obtained an extension of time  from the bidders for the awarding of  the contract. As soon as the contract  was  awarded,  the  contractor  com menced work on the first phase and  has proceeded on schedule  to date.  Construction on  the  first  phase  is  scheduled for completion later in 1981.  At the time the repayment contract  was signed, the estimated costs alloca ble to municipal and industrial water  supply were $27 ,966,000 based on Jan uary 1976 prices and the interest rate  provided for  fiscal year 1976. As of  June 1981, the Bureau of Reclamation  estimates that the costs allocable  to  municipal and industrial water supply  will be approximately $69 million. Ap proximately 60 percent of the increase  from $28 million to $69 million has re sulted from increases in construction  costs caused by design changes, state  of the art considerations, dam safety  considerations, and added instrumen tation, all of which were unanticipated  at the time the repayment contract  was negotiated. The remaining 40 per cent of the cost increase is attributa ble to inflation.  The repayment contract does not ob ligate the Conservancy District to re negotiate, or make any other adjust ments  in  its  contractual  obligation  should the costs allocable to municipal  and industrial water supply exceed $38  million. To the contrary, the $38 mil lion figure is an absolute ceiling.  This provision stands in marked con trast to the terms of all other repay ment contracts, which  typically pro vide  for  ceilings  that must be  in creased to cover the costs allocable to  municipal and industrial water supply  should such costs prove to be in excess  of those contemplated at the time of  the execution of a contract. The lack  of this renegotiation provision in the  repayment contract executed by the  Conservancy District  indicates,  and  ",1983
69,Senate,98,0.498,1107,3,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President,  the  emergency  supplemental  appropria tions bill is being described as an anti recession jobs bill by some-but I have  grave doubts as to how many items in  that bill deserve that label. I have ex pressed my concerns  in a memoran dum to Senator HATFIELD, chairman of  the Appropriations Committee,  and  have suggested  to him various steps  that could be taken to insure that the  bill really becomes what it has been la beled. A copy of that memorandum is  attached to my statement.  The Appropriations Committee will  mark up the bill on Monday, March 7  and it will therefore not be ready for  Senate  action until well  into next  week. I believe that the issues raised  by this bill are of major importance  and deserve  reasoned  consideration.  That will not be possible, however,  unless we deal with  the  immediate  emergency that is facing us-the fact  that the States will soon run out of  money to pay unemployment compen sation claims. Additional money must  be made  available  by next Friday,  March 11. I am therefore introducing  with Senator CARL LEVIN an emergen cy  supplemental  appropriation  bill  that will only be sufficient to meet all  the States' needs for unemployment  compensation until the Easter recess.  By enacting that bill immediately, we  can both deal with the unemployment  compensation crisis and give fair conin sideration  to  the complex  issues  volved in the jobs supplemental.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of my memorandum to Senator  HATFIELD and the text of the bill be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  COMMITTEE ON LABOR  AND HUMAN RESOURCES,  Washington, D. C.  To:  Senator MARK  HATFIELD.  Chairman,  Senate Appropriations Committee.  From: DAN QUAYLE.  Date: March 2, 1983.  As you know,  I am concerned that the  Emergency  Supplemental  Appropriation  Act actually be a constructive response to  current high unemployment rates. It seems  to me that any measure which promises to  provide jobs as a countercyclical tool must  be based on four principles:  First, it must provide a reasonable number  of jobs in relationship to the proposed ex penditure;  Second, it must provide those jobs during  the current high unemployment period;  it must concentrate jobs areas of  high unemployment; and  Fourth, it must target those jobs on those  hardest hit by unemployment.  It is, of course, difficult to assure compli ance with these principles in the context of  an appropriations bill. However,  I believe  that the very same conditions which justify  an emergency bill require a non-traditional  approach to that bill.  I therefore recommend that with respect  to any appropriations account  that is  in cluded in the emergency bill because it is de Third,  signed as a jobs response to the current re cession,  the following provisos be added to  the appropriations language:  1. No grant shall be made under the pro gram unless the grantee certifies that funds  will be used so that there will be at least one  person year of direct employment for every  $20,000 of funds received.  2. Funds shall be available for obligation  until September 30, 1983 and for expendi ture for no more than 18 months after date  of obligation.  3. Funds shall be distributed so that at  least 75% of the funds are distributed  to  States (in the case of State grant programs>  or areas <in the case of direct grants to sub state areas> in which the rate of unemploy ment for the last three months of 1982 was  higher than the national average rate of un employment.  4. No grant shall be made under the pro gram unless 75% of the persons hired pursu ant to the grant shall be certified by the  local agency of the USES as unemployed  and as having been unemployed for at least  15 weeks in the preceding six months.  The inclusion of such language would pro vide statutory safeguards  that  the maxi mum number of jobs be created, that they  be created during the period when unem ployment is projected to remain in the 10%  range and that the jobs be targeted both to  high unemployment  areas  and  to  those  hardest hit by unemployment.  I believe it is important that these provi sions be incorporated into the House passed  bill either in the Appropriations Committee  or on the floor. We are promising the Amer ican people a jobs bill and I fear that with out such provisions the bill would fall short  of the promises.  S.678  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That the  following sums are appropriated, out of any  money in the Treasury not otherwise appro priated, for the fiscal year 1983;  DEPARTMENT OF LABOR  EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION  ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND  AND OTHER FUNDS  For an additional amount for ""Advances  to  the Unemployment Trust Fund  and  Other Funds"", $600,000,000 to remain avail able until September 30, 1984.e  By Mr. PERCY:  S. 679.

70,Senate,98,0.099,1107,3,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, it is my  privilege  to  introduce  today  in  the  Senate a creative and sound approach  to this Nation's unemployment prob lem, one which was developed and in troduced in the House of Representa tives by my distinguished Illinois col league, Congresswoman LYNN MARTIN.  This  legislation-H.R.  116  in  the  House-authorizes a new type of reve nue-sharing program to be used by the  States, with Governors  as  the key  leaders in developing employment pro grams for the unemployed.  Our legislation provides for a 2-year  program of grants to the States, with  a yearly authorization of $3 billion.  The funds would be allocated among  the States  according  to  a  formula  based  one-third  on  population  and  two-thirds on wage and salary growth  compared to the national average. All  of the money will be under the juris diction of the Governor of each State.  He or she will be directed to spend 50  percent of  the money on qualifying  employment projects in those counties  of the State which have above average  unemployment and below average per  capita income, according to a formula  spelled out in the bill. The other 50  percent can be spent in the rest of the  State.  In all cases of funding, it is the Gov ernor who determines what jobs pro grams will be undertaken. He must  consult with the State job training co ordinating council as established last  year by the Job Training Partnership  Act. The council is composed of busi ness and labor representatives and of  State and local officials. He must de termine that the projects funded will  contribute most to the creation of jobs  for the unemployed in the State and,  further, he is required to present an  explanation of how these expenditures  can be expected to increase jobs and  why one particular use of funds  to  create jobs was chosen over another.  ",1983
71,Senate,98,0.078,1120,3,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing the Natural Gas Policy  Act Amendments of 1983.  Its enact ment would provide  immediate price  relief  to all natural gas consumers,  providing an average annual savings  for each  residential consumer of at  least $200, a nationwide total annual  savings of $25 billion.  In no way is it an oversimplification  to  state  that many Pennsylvanians  and people across our Nation will be  faced with the choice of heating or  eating this year.  The citizens of my home State and  many others know only too well that  gas prices have outstripped both their  income earning capabilities and that  these crippling price increases have af fected other goods and services.  Consider  that  between  1978  and  1981,  the  income of a Pennsylvania  manufacturing employee increased by  30 percent while his natural gas bill in crease by 127 percent.  Consider that between September of  1978 and September of 1982, the gas  rates charged by the six pipelines serv ing Pennsylvania increased by an aver age of 175.6 percent while  the Con sumer Price Index was growing by 47.2  percent.  Consider  that  between  1978  and  1982, gas prices charged to residential  consumers in the city of Philadelphia  increased by in excess of 94 percent  and  in the city of Pittsburgh by  in  excess of 86 percent.  I said earlier, many Pennsylva nians will be faced with the choice of  heating or eating this year.  Over 350,000 Pennsylvania families  fall below 125 percent of the poverty  level,  the  financial dividing  line  for  most  Federal  assistance  programs.  That line is $5,016 per year, or $418  per month in disposable income. After  spending money for rent, the gas bill,  the nonheating electric utility bill, and  food,  the  average  family  of  three  below the poverty level will find itself  $33 in debt.  Just as bad  is  that plight of  the  single  elderly Pennsylvanian  totally  dependent on a maximum supplemen tary  security  income  payment  of  $317 .60 per month.

72,Senate,98,-0.422,1133,3,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, for the  past 2 years, this administration has  tried to achieve economic growth with  only one tool: fiscal policy. This led to  almost no growth or anemic growth at  best.  At the same time, the Federal Re serve Board has conducted a very con servative monetary policy  that has  made growth nearly impossible. As a  result, at a time when we most need to  expand  the  economic pie,  it keeps  shrinking.  The  resolution Senator MOYNIHAN  and I are introducing calls on the Fed eral Reserve Board to manage mone tary policy so as to achieve the aver age real growth rate of previous post war recoveries. It is based on the expe rience of  those  recoveries  that eco nomic growth requires an accommoda tive monetary policy. It makes high  economic growth, once again, the pri mary economic priority of the United  States.  The  danger  of  failing  to move  toward an accommodative monetary  policy at this time is clear: the recov ery which most economists believe is  now beginning could quickly founder  and we could sink into a third reces sion in as many years.  It is  time for a strong, affirmative  statement that all our economic poli cies-monetary and fiscal-will be di rected toward high economic growth.  This is essential for the health of our  changing economy and for the health  of the world economy. A move by our  Government toward a more accommo dative monetary policy would alleviate  the growing debt problem of develop ing countries and would give a needed  boost to the economies of our allies.  The benefits from hlgher growth are  striking:  The Moynihan-Hart proposal would  give u.s a GNP of $577 billion by 1988,  11.6 percent higher than the current  administration projections.  Putting monetary policy back on a  growth path would put 1,400,000 more  people back to work by 1988 than the  administration plan.  Personal income and corporate prof its would also be higher.  There would be substantial recovery  in housing and autos.    Growth  also makes  a  substantial  contribution to  reducing  the size of  the deficit in future years if we also  need to take a number of other initia tives to contain spending and increase  revenues to keep the deficit under con trol. For instance, the combination of  higher growth under Moynihan-Hart  and a delay in the implementation of  indexing brings the 1988 deficit down  to $15 billion.  The program does contain one cost:  Under Moynihan-Hart plan, the Con sumer Price Index would rise from 6.1  percent in 1982 to 6.8 percent in 1988.  This assumption is based on oil price  estimates that came before the recent  tumble  in world oil prices-the 1988  results would look better if they were  based on today's estimates.  However, we still need to develop a  program to control inflation. The past  2 years are a stark reminder of the  costs of fighting inflation with a deep  recession. The country has lost hun dreds of billions of dollars, millions of  people have been thrown out of work,  and  investments  in our future have  been delayed, cut back or cancelled.  The controls of  the Nixon years  proved to be costly in a quite different  way and are an unacceptable solution.  What we need  is a  policy or more  likely a combination of policies that  will continue to wind down inflation  and prepare us for any future price  shocks.

At a  time  when the value of devoted public serv ice is too often ignored, it is refreshing  to report that the Portage County Bar  Association will acknowledge its appre ciation on March 23, 1983, by present ing these two fine people with certifi cates of merit for outstanding service.  Mrs. Dennison and Mr. Kramer have  demonstrated unfailing patience and  courtesy, devotion to duty and atten tive service to both the public and to  members of the Bench and Bar Asso ciation in Portage County.  Mrs. Dennison, presently the assign ment commissioner  for  the Portage  County Common Pleas Court, was se lected for  the position  in 1972. She  previously worked for 5 years as the  Jury Commissioner and  receptionist  for the Court of Common Pleas and as  2 years as secretary to the 11th Dis trict Member of Congress from Ohio.  Mrs. Dennison has also been active in  local charity work, educational activi ties, Little League Baseball, and politi cal campaigns. She and her husband,  Robert, have three childre and are the  proud grandparents of a grandson.  Mr. Kramer, currently administrator  for  the  Portage  County  Juvenile  Court, was chosen for his position in  1967 by the late Honorable Sam Sum mers. Mr. Kramer first joined the ju venile court as a probation officer in  1951 and then became chief probation  officer in 1960. Prior to his work in ju venile court, Mr. Kramer served as a  Kent City patrolman for 5 years and  as a member of the U.S. Air Force for  4 years. He has long been active in the  Fraternal Order of Police,  the Kent  Masonic  Lodge,  the  Northeastern  Ohio Youth Commission and the Ohio  Court and Correctional Association.  His community work has included area  youth sports organizations,  the Cub  Scouts, the Kiwanis Club and others.  He and Muriel, his wife of 44 years,  reside in Kent, Ohio.

76,House,98,-0.161,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may re quire.  Mr. Chairman, may I say that the  job we have here today-and it is a job  in itself-is one that I did not volun teer for, but I was more or less drafted  to do. However, being drafted as I was,  I felt it is an area where we need, as I  see it, to work together for the good of  the country.  There is no question that unemploy ment  is  rampant over  the country.  There is no question that many, many  people are in bankruptcy, and the situ ation is growing worse. I read in the  papers  that  the  stock market has  picked up, but we know that the stock  market has picked up  in  times past  when the bottom was falling out. Now  is the time that we do something for  the  unemployed  people  of  our  country.  May I  trace briefly with the Mem bers the legislative situation that we  have here. Last year I was asked to  deal with a bill that was ref erred to  our Committee on Appropriations that  amounted to jobs relief to be distribut ed over the United States. It was my  advice that there was no way that the  Congress should pass such a bill as it  was proposed. After conferring with  my friends who had introduced it, the  authors,  the gentleman  from Ken tucky <Mr. PERKINS),  the gentleman  from Texas <Mr. WRIGHT), the gentle man from Minnesota <Mr. OBERSTAR),  and  the gentleman  from California  <Mr. HAWKINS), we rewrote it into a jobs  bill in the Committee on Appropria tions.  May I say that when the pressure  was on us to come up with a jobs bill, I  did not know any better way  to ap proach it than the way we did.  Then during December  in connec tion with  the continuing  resolution,  we developed a  jobs bill which  the  House passed, and which  the Presi dent had said  in the newspapers he  was going to veto. Later in conference,  it was withdrawn with the approval of  the leadership of the House. This year  I called the subcommittee chairman of  the Appropriations Committee togeth er and asked them to bring to us those  projects  in  their  respective  jurisdic tions which take care of our country's  needs and create jobs. Many of these  programs have been justified but not  funded. I do not know how we could go  about getting a better base on which  to start, because  the Appropriations  Committee and its 13 subcommittees  each year holds hundreds of days of  hearings before the committees. That  is an annual procedure.  In the  last  Congress, the 97th Congress, we had  over 11,000 witnesses, Americans, that  come before us and testify in behalf of  various projects.  So there is no better starting point,  in my opinion, than to ask the sub committee's who are familiar with it  and  the  subcommittee chairmen  to  bring  forward  the needed projects,  again those which had been justified  but had not been funded, as a starting  point toward putting people back  to  work.  Please remember, last year's bill was  passed by the House, and .it went to  the Senate. We were  in process of  working out a compromise with our  counterpart on the other side, and the  President  announced  that  he was  going to veto it if we  tried to move  with a jobs title. At ,that point I came  to our leadership and said, ""The Presi dent has said in advance  that he  is  going to veto it, and we might just as  well withdraw it."" So we went ahead  and did withdraw it.  ",1983

Let me add: When the United States  is at  the  lowest economic point  in  nearly 50 years, when you are near the  bottom, there is only one way to go,  and that is up. That is up and hopeful ly that is where we are headed.  Mr. Chairman,  I want  to  take  a  moment  to  address  something  the  ranking minority Member mentioned  in his debate concerning the McGee  Creek project in Oklahoma. He men tioned Oklahoma has 6. 7 percent un employment, and that is probably true  for the entire State of Oklahoma. The  ranking minority Membe.r from Massa chusetts is a friend of mine. And hope fully, there might be some money for  that project if the Bureau of Reclama tion sees fit. In Atoka County where  that project is,  there is 13.4 percent  unemployment. There is 17 .3 percent  unemployment  in  the  neighboring  Pushmataha County. There  is  16.4  percent in the coal county just north  of Atoka County and there is 15.4 per cent in Choctaw County to the south.  That is an economic rural depressed  area of chronically unemployed and  underemployed  in  this Nation,  that  has not been addressed by this Con gress or by this administration. The  people in rural America are the under dogs of the underdogs. They are the  forgotten people.  I  regret very much when  I  find  people  coming up  and  attacking  a  project or an area who do not have the  facts concerning the economic situa tion. Sixty-eight percent of the people  have left many of these counties  in  the 50 years in the search for a  job.  They have left trying to find a der.ent  fulltime job. Our children still ou\mi grate and the Grapes of Wrath of our  educated young people is continuing.  I ask the people to take these facts  into consideration when they vote on  this jobs bill. I have asked the leader ship of the House and I have asked  the administration not to just look at  State statistics, but ask, ""What about  economically deprived, depressed rural  areas of  this  country?"" They have  been ignored in the past, but hopeful ly this bill will meet a  few of those  needs.  I ask you to support this bill.  D 1330  The CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Chairman,  this measure does  not please any of us completely, yet it  is a program which I believe permits  us to get the beginnings of aid quickly  to many of those who need it desper ately.  Hawaii's jobless banks are filled with  those who have remained without em ployment for extremely lengthy peri ods. Seventy percent of  the unem ployed have remained so for 5 weeks  or longer; a full 30 percent have been  jobless 14 weeks or more. Those who  are suffering as a result of Honolulu's  ailing construction  industry will cer tainly benefit  from  the  infusion of  community development block grant  ( CDBG) and other construction funds  provided by this legislation.  I  am,  however,  deeply  concerned  that the measure before us will not  adequately aid the rest of our long term unemployed. A more direct and  substantial means of providing  jobs  must be produced to assist these struc turally unemployed in Hawaii and the  rest of the Nation.  Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I urge  my colleagues  to swiftly adopt H.R.  1718, but just as swiftly develop fur ther legislation with far greater job creation value.e  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 1718 providing $4.6  billion in emergency expenditures to  create new jobs and to urge its approv al by the House.  Mr. Chairman, the committee report  cites a 13.6 unemployment rate in my  home State of Pennsylvania. In some  sections of my congressional district it  is nearly double that figure. And for  those of us who have wished prosperi ty and those of us who have supported  policies we thought would speed that  prosperity these are cold and grim and  disappointing statistics. For in them selves  they contain  those who have  given up the hope for work and those  who are now saying ""I'll do anything  for a job."" They do not speak to those  just entering the job market fearing  their skills will have no place to be put  to the test.  We agreed to meet those needs and I  believe today this bill takes a positive  step  in that direction.  I know  there  will be members and critics who will  deride this bill as another make-work  bill. In these days of high unemploy ment the term make-work carries less  of a stigma than in times of prosperi ty. We have to make work and we have  to make more work  than  is  even  dreamed of in this bill if our Nation is  to prosper.  Before the Members of this House  raise the roof over the issue of make work jobs, let me ask you to take a  look at the $5 billion you are about to  appropriate  to keep  the unemploy ment compensation fund so.lvent and  keep benefits  flowing  to  the unem ployed. Ask yourselves whether or not  we should put those people to work or  whether we ought to meet here again  in 6 months and vote for another mul tibillion-dollar replenishment.  My friends, I call your attention to  the segments of the bill relating to the  Interior and related agencies appro priations. We provided funds for ac tivities with  a  quick  payout. We  funded programs that were already in  place and ready to go. and we funded  programs where we knew that there  were a meaningful number of jobs cre ated for the money spent.  We added funds for the successful  weatherization program. This program  not only helps save energy  it puts  roughly 50 people to work full time in  a construction program for every mil lion dollars we spend. We added $50  million for cyclic maintenance to the  National Park Service, relying heavily  on the administration's priority needs  and committing money now for  this  work in time for the spring construc tion  season. Likewise we  added an other $45 million for maintenance and  construction needs  of  the national  forest system, another $40 million for  badly needed Indian health construc tion and $25 million for cyclic mainte nance at the Nation's fish and wildlife  refuges and hatcheries.  This bill  also  contains  significant  outlays of money for our existing com munity development block grant pro gram, urban action grant program and  to the programs of the Economic De velopment Administration. Mr. Chair man, I can think of no quicker way to  get jobs, especially construction jobs,  underway  on  vital  public  improve ments than to expand the community  development program. To those who  believe as I do that the Federal dollar  is a carrot on the stick that builds pri vate investments into public expendi tures let me suggest that the urban  action grant program and the econom ic development grant program lever age private dollars from a tight econo my that otherwise might not be invest ed. These programs have proven track  records of generating as much as five  and six private dollars for every one  Federal dollar invested in the creation  of new jobs.  Mr. Chairman, the most optimistic  among us must concede that at most  we may be creating 300,000 jobs. The  most pessimistic among us may say  that is not enough. Both are  right.  But I will vote for this bill rather than  sit idly by and wait for our appropria tions committee  to come forth with  the next installment in the replenish ment of the unemployment compensa tion fund.  This bill is not perfect. It contains  no new ideas on job creation. It relies  mostly on existing programs.  It re quires  few  if any new structures.  I  intend to support it and I am hopeful  that  the  investment we make here  today will create new jobs tomorrow.   e ",1983
82,House,98,0.253,1198,3,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Chairman, last Wednesday, the direc tor of the Employment Security Divi sion in Arkansas notified me that as of  this Friday, March 4, due to insuffi cient funds  they would be forced  to  resort to mailing IOU's to over 70,000  unemployed  citizens.  Fortunately;  however,  information was  received  today  advising  that  $8,030,461  has  been allocated, to Arkansas in addition  to the $6,524,000 which was provided  earlier. This total of $14,554,461 will  now be  sufficient  to provide  funds  through March 15.  I know my col leagues will agree that it is preposter ous  to  think  that  unemployment  checks would not have been issued had  this not occurred.

That is what is going to happen.  They will  just delay it and delay  it,  and we are giving the agencies a blank  check  to delay  this as  long as  they  want to.  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a bad  amendment, and members ought to be  aware of the problems involved before  its goes to conference.  The CHAIRMAN.

85,House,98,-0.378,1224,3,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, in the sections of this bill dealing  with funds for health and social serv ices,  the committee  report makes  it  clear that those funds shall be target ed based on unemployment and  the  greatest  demand  for  services. This  amendment  assures  that  the provi sions of the bill aimed at job creation  shall be focused on the areas where  there is the greatest need for job cre ation. The ref ore,  the amendment  is  both necessary  and  consistent with  other portions of the bill.  This Nation has  reached  a  point  where CARE packages are being sent  to the unemployed in Michigan from  West Germany  and  the mayor  of  Cleveland states that his city is run ning out of ways to feed its hungry. It  is time for action.  This  is  the  sentiment  that  has  strongly prevailed among new Demo cratic Members  as we  have  spent  hours working on the jobs issue. Influ enced  by  this work,  Congressman  BRUCE MORRISON and I presented  to  the  Rules  Committee  a  targeting  amendment, a proposal now incorpo rated in this amendment; 12 days ago  when  I was  talking  to unemployed  women and men in a suburban Detroit  unemployment  compensation  office,  an unemployed worker  said  to me:  ""The toughest job in Michigan today  is finding a job.""  This amendment is critical if we are  to respond to that poignant commen tary on  the state of  the Nation  in  March 1983.  Mr. MORRISON  Mr. Chairman, will  yield?  ",1983
86,House,98,-0.396,1224,3,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, this targeting amend ment  is one of  the most  important  goals we should have  in considering  this bill. This is a  jobs bill. This is a  bill that is intended to bring relief to  millions of unemployed people in this  country, and if we are to bring that  relief, we should to the greatest extent  possible  target it in accordance with  the need.  Now, there is some concern that had  been expressed about individuals who  have been out of the work force for so  long that they are not counted among  the unemployed. There are many such  individuals in my community, in one  of the towns I represent, New Haven,  Conn. In fact, New Haven, Conn., has  the seventh largest rate of poverty in  the United States, and,  in fact, New  Haven, Conn., has a relatively low un employment rate. It is true that when  individuals have been so long out of  the work force, they stop being count ed as unemployed.  But something else happens. They  are counted as poor. They enter the  statistic about the poverty rate, and  one critical element of  this amend ment is that it takes that fact into ac count. The poverty rate, as well as the  unemployment rate,  is being used to  target these funds. That is being done  by  using  the  urban  development  action grant program which targets on  communities in distress.  We have achieved  in  this amend ment a way of  targeting that group  that the distinguished gentleman from  Iowa <Mr. SMITH) has referred to, the  unemployed poor who have been out  of work for so long that they are no  longer  counted  as  unemployed. We  have done  that for all  jurisdictions,  towns, townships, cities, and counties,  and we have also done it for pockets of  poverty within jurisdictions where the  poverty rate or unemployment itself is  not high.  Targeting is a key to this bill, and  the addition of this amendment will  give us  the  targeting  that we need,  both in those communities of high un employment and in those communities  of high rates of poverty.

91,,98,-0.318,1302,3,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker. every  war produces those who stand out as  individuals  who  expressed  their  unique abilities  through acts of un common courage and valor. The most  supreme acts of heroism are  recog nized with the Medal of Honor.  This recognition by the President in  the name of the Congress may only be  accorded an  individual who  ""distin guished himself conspicuously by gal lantry and intrepidity at the risk of  his life above and beyond the call of  duty"".  New Jerseyite John Basilone distin guished himself not once. but many  times, on the field of battle as Ameri can forces engaged the enemy in the  Pacific some 40 years ago. Basilone's  herosim at Guadalcanal was awarded  by the presentation of first Congres sional Medal of Honor to be received  by an enlisted Marine in World War  II. Forsaking stateside duty, Sergeant  Basilone was  reassigned  to  combat  duty at his own request; 38 years ago  this month, Basilone died in service to  his country. Basilone was posthumous ly awarded the Navy Cross, the Navy's  second highest military decoration, for  gallantry displayed as he led his unit  through Iwo Jima enemy lines.  It is sad that more people do not re member John Basilone and his uncom mon contributions. I support the ef forts of Mayor Steve Del Rocco and  the people of Raritan, N.J., Basilone's  hometown, to gain greater recognition  for  this  special American. Donato  Sodano of the New Jersey Army and  Navy Union has also been tireless in  supporting efforts to honor Basilone.  Perhaps the greatest honor we may  bestow upon John Basilone, and the  over 1 million other Americans to have  died in war, is to remember those who  still suffer as a result of having sur vived war.  Our great task now as a nation is to  insure that those who served, and suf fered  in defense of our liberties, are  not denied the respect, benefits, and  rights they have earned. I urge my col leagues to join me in this task.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  John Basilone's story for the benefit  of my colleagues.  March 3, 1983  [From the Sunday Star-Ledger, Feb. 13,  1983]  GREATER RECOGNITION SOUGHT FOR JERSEY  WAR HERO  FRIENDS PUSHING STATE TO HONOR MEMORY OF  MARINE AT IWO JIMA  <By James Benson)  New J erseyan John A. Basilone will for ever be remembered in United States mili tary annals, but today few residents in his  home state know about the heroic Marine  who was killed at Iwo Jima.  The Raritan resident was the first enlisted  Marine in World War II to win the Congres sional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest  military decoration, for heroism at Guadal canal.  Given a stateside tour of duty promoting  the sale of war bonds after Guadalcanal, Ba silone requested a return to combat.  He was killed by a mortar blast during the  invasion of Iwo Jima 38 years go this Satur day, on Feb. 19, 1945, after an amazing dis play of courage on the battlefield for which  he was posthumously awarded  the Navy  Cross.  He is buried in Arlington National Ceme tery, Arlington, Va.  Some people say he should have received  a second Medal of Honor for his heroism on  Iwo Jima.  Many contend that despite a number of  monuments to Basilone erected around the  state, he has never been appropriately me morialized in New Jersey.  Now  a  longtime  admirer  of Basilone.  Donato Sodano of Maplewood,  is  calling  again for ""proper recognition"" of the ser geant and his deeds.  Sodano took part in memorial ceremonies  for Basilone on the anniversary of his death  almost every year until 1973. Since  then,  health problems have  forced him  to stay  home.  ""I don't think the state of New Jersey has  done  enough  to  honor  this outstanding  man,"" remarked Sodano, 75, a retired insur ance agent who served in the Army during  World War II.  As an official of the New Jersey chapter  of a veterans' organization, the Army and  Navy Union, Sodano spearheaded a drive in  1950 to have the New Jersey Turnpike, then  under construction, named for Basilone.  The Turnpike authority turned down So dano's group and other veterans' organiza tions supporting the proposal.  Pike officials said legislation authorizing  construction of the superhighway required  that it be named as it was, the New Jersey  Turnpike.  As a gesture to the vets' groups, the turn pike officials agreed to name the turnpike  bridge over the Raritan River in New Bruns wick for Basilone.  Sodano and his group were not invited to  the dedication of the bridge, he said.  ""I intend to confer with our Department  of New Jersey Army and Navy Union offi cials to start a statewide campaign in con junction with other veteran groups to have  the state of New Jersey take some action to  accord proper recognition to one of its most  illustrious sons and one of our country's  outstanding heroes,"" Sodano said.  October 1942, the month when John Basi lone won the Medal of Honor, was a grim  and desperate time for Americans struggling  to hold the strategic airbase called Hender son Field on the island of Guadalc;mal.  The outcome of the first American Pacific  offensive of World War II was uncertain as  ",1983

One of these stamps will feature the  Bobtail, the last horse-drawn streetcar  in America, located in Sulphur Rock,  Ark. The Bobtail was  in operation  from 1889  to 1926 when  it was  re placed by the automobile.  Sulphur Rock's post office was es tablished in 1834. When the streetcar  line opened, it connected the town's  business  section with  the  railrmid  depot, 1 mile away.  The honor of this postage stamp is a  great tribute to the people and history  of Sulphur Rock and  Independence  County and also the pioneering efforts  of the line's owner and operator, John  C. Huddleston.  It is also well-deserved recognition of  the enterprising spirit of smalltown  Arkansas and smalltown America.  I  commend the Postal Service on this  selection.

95,Senate,98,0.589,103,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  proponents of an $8.5 billion expan sion of the U.S. commitment to the  International Monetary Fund have in cluded  among  their  arguments  the  point that an increase in the Fund's  resources will protect the stability of  the  international banking system  in  general,  and more  particularly  the  standing of many of our Nation's larg est  banks. After  reading  the  1983  Annual Banking Survey, published in  the April 11 issue of Forbes magazine,  one cannot help but wonder if anyone  has bothered to tell the banks that  they are supposed to be in so much  trouble.  As  the survey's authors point out,  the banks have adopted tactical book keeping maneuvers to insure that the  real  impact of  their shaky  foreign  loans does not filter through to the  bottom  line. An  increase  in  the re sources of the IMF will lead directly to  greater  demands  for  private  bank  lending, which in turn will cause this  charade to be played out still further.  If 1983 is going to be as good a year  for the banks as the analysts predict,  Mr. President, they should not fear a  partial write-down of these  loans  to  more realistic values. If the predicted  performance of the banking industry  is illusory, it is all the more reason to  guard against a situation in which in capable  foreign  borrowers will pull  them more deeply into the hole simply  because the IMF, in a market-defying  allocation of capital, makes its assist ance contingent upon greater bank ex posure. In essence, the time has come  to reject the IMF quota increase and  to rely upon the free marketplace to  expose the reality of the international  ",1983

98,House,98,-0.321,129,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  one of the aspects of the American  dream is owning your own home. Mil lions of Americans have toiled away in  our factories, our mines, and markets  in search of the financial resources to  realize that dream.  This cruel recession that started 2  years ago has dashed that dream for  many Americans. Many people in my  district are out of work as a result of  the worst economic downturn  in 50  years. The recession has stopped the  demand  for  copper,  uranium,  and  other minerals mined in northern New  Mexico. The  lifeline of employment  for so many thousands in my district  has been cut off and families are faced  with the horror of not being able to  make their house payments. Some are  faced with the prospect of losing their  homes.  Mr. Speaker, some 61,000 New Mexi cans would  fall within the scope of  this legislation. That is a clear indica tion of how many people in my State  are in dire need of relief. The Emer gency Housing Assistance Act will be  an important first step for the people  of my district and homeowners across  the country to keep their homes while  they wait for the recession to end and  for their jobs to return.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Emergency Housing Assistance Act. I  commend my distinguished colleague  from the State of Texas, the chairman  of  the Housing Subcommittee,  for  bringing to the floor a piece of legisla tion that will show that we in the Con gress have compassion in our hearts  and  that we want all Americans  to  have a place that they can call home.

I was absolutely shocked and amazed  by what I saw on that trip. Everybody  there knows that the United States is  financing  an  effort  by  Somoza's  former security forces  to move from  Honduras into Nicaragua to raid the  common citizens of that country,  to  kidnap  them,  to murder  them, and  this sort of activity. They all know  that it is the United States, and I hope  that we realize that we are doing the  financing.  First of all,  it is morally wrong.  I  wish you could have been with me and  met with the mothers whose children  had been killed by those former secu rity forces.  Second,  it  is  surely pragmatically  wrong. Do we think for 1 minute that  we  are  going  to  do  anything but  strengthen the hold of the Sandinista  government on the people by arming  former criminals to come back and kill  the people within  that country? As  one of the Sandinistas told me:  If you really want democracy, we cannot  understand why it would be that you would  want the former security guard of Somoza  to come back and take over our country.  I would hope that the people of this  body would look at what is really hap pening and  rise up and  take what  action should be taken to stop this ter rible, terrible activity of our Govern ment.

Here is the reason I  asked the question: The freeze cannot  be understood as a statement or reflec tion of congressional interest, a policy  interest on the part of the Congress  unless  it  is understood against  the  policy objectives of the START negoti ations. That is why the freeze  is on  the floor today.  One  of  the weaknesses,  of  the  START negotiations, and indeed, one  of the strengths of the freeze resolu tion, is that in the case of bombers,  bombers are frozen under the freeze  but not under START. Let me  just  give the gentleman a couple of exam ples.  The Backfire bomber: The Soviet  Union has 180 of these today. Under  the freeze, they would be left there at  180. Under START there is no limit.  As many dreaded Backfire bombers as  possible could be built.  The Blackjack bomber: The Black jack bombers, which all of us are con cerned about, and do not want the So viets  to develop,  and produce,  and  deploy, they have one on a test basis  right now. Under the freeze, because  the  freeze  deals with bombers and  START does not, under  the  freeze  they would be  left with one. If we  want to stop the Blackjack, the freeze  is the way to do it. The START negoti ations leaves that unlimited.  I want to add one other thing.  ",1983

104,House,98,0.691,155,7,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise in support of the Levitas amend ment. It offers a  reasonable alterna tive which should satisfy both sides.  Some commentators are billing the  upcoming vote on House Joint Resolu tion 13 as being historic, the first offi cial statement that the Congress of  the United States is in favor of putting  a stop to the arms race as a prelude to  ending that race. Melodramatic rheto ric aside, I rise to question the use of  the term ""historic"" as well as the logic  of concluding that this freeze will help  end the arms  race.  It seems  to me  that, if you remove any incentive one  side might have to negotiate an equi table  reduction of nuclear weapons,  the end result will be either a continu ation of the arms race or an ever wors ening strategic situation for the other  side or both.  The word ""historic"" implies that the  event under discussion  is either un precedented or of momentous signifi cance. However,  this  is not the first  time Americans, or peace loving peo ples of other nations, have attempted  to legislate an arms reduction agree ment or an agreement limiting produc tion  or  deployment  of  a weapons  system considered  to be particularly  dangerous. Indeed, what is so interest ing about this particular effort is not  that is plows new ground, but rather  that it goes over ground plowed so un successfully in the past which, in turn,  suggests the effort is not momentous  in a positive sense.  No one likes to think that war is in evitable or that a sound and lasting  peace  is  impossible  to achieve, but  during more than 4,000 years of re corded  human  history,  there  have  been very few years in which no war  has been fought. In just the 206 years  since  the Declaration of  Independ ence, America has fought no less than  10 wars-6 declared, 3 undeclared and  1 civil-spanning 29 years in time. In  each case, this Nation came to its own  defense or that of its allies, but the  fact we have not been in the habit of  initiating wars has not kept us out of  them. In short, the pages of history  clearly suggest that a national desire  to stay out of war is an insufficient  guarantee  that  a  nation  can have  peace and yet stay  free. For every  nation like Switzerland there must be  10 examples of nations that have had  to fight for their freedom or have seen  that freedom go by the boards.  Just as the desire for peace has not  been an antedote for war, neither have  broad declarations of peace or one sided disarmament  agreements kept  war from breaking out. No better ex ample of that grim reality exists than  the era between World Wars I and II.  In 1922, for example, a naval agree ment was reached calling on many of  the world's naval powers to limit war ship construction, yet that agreement  did not forestall Japan from building  up their navy to the point where it  could  launch  a  devastating  sneak  attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1928, the  United States and many other nations  signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which  essentially outlawed war but its exist ence did not deter Japan from invad ing Manchuria,  Italy  from  invading  Ethiopia, or Germany from invading  Poland and starting World War  II.  Neither did the self-imposed Neutrali ty Acts of the 1930's, which put strict  limitations  on  the  kinds  of  goods  American companies could ship over seas, keep  the United States out of  World War II. Nor did  the Munich  Pact of 1938, which the British Prime  Minister hailed as ""peace in our time,""  keep the Germans from swallowing up  the other half of Czechoslovakia 6  months later. The key to any peace  agreement or disarmament arrange ment lies in the ability of its adher ents to enforce it. And without a mili tary capability clearly perceived to be  at least equal to,  if not superior to,  any and all others, such enforcement  efforts are doomed to failure, if indeed  they are launched at all. Potential ag gressors have never viewed a sheaf of  papers as a substitute for an adequate  military deterrent;  if anything,  the  substitution of words for weapons has  been viewed as a sign of weakness de serving of exploitation.  It is often argued that nuclear weap ons are so horrible that no one would  dare start a war, especially since either  of  the  superpowers  supposedly has  enough nuclear weapons to totally de stroy the other. However, the history  of weapons and war pokes holes in the  first  argument  and  logic  says  the  second  is  questionable  on  the one  hand and limited in its applicability on  the other. Of course, nuclear weapons  have a  terrible potential for destruc tion, when compared to conventional  air warfare for instance, but think of  the terror that must have been felt by  the swordsmen, spearthrowers and ci vilians of the Middle Ages when gun power was  first  introduced and  the  musket became a weapon war. Yet  that terror did not prevent the advent  of another war. Think too how 19th  century soldiers must have felt when  the forerunner of the machine gun the gatling gun-cut  them down  in  rows as they tried to advance on an  enemy position. Yet that terror did  not prevent  the outbreak of World  ",1983
105,House,98,0.325,168,7,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding  this  time  to  me.  Mr. Chairman, I would like  to ex plain briefly the reason I objected to a  time limitation before was that I had  not had an opportunity  to read the  Levitas amendment.  I have the same concerns similar to  those expressed by our colleague, the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  <Mr.  AsPIN).  I am of  the opinion  that a  builddown as a part of this freeze reso lution could actually put us in more of  an  inferior position  than  the freeze  itself. The reason I say that is since we  began converting or modernizing our  Minuteman forces to the Minuteman  III  configuration,  the Soviets  have  fielded  three brand new ICBM mis siles.  That means that their force modern ization is way ahead of ours, and if we  want to get any kind of a moderniza tion program to try to keep some kind  of a parity, we are going to have to  modernize but under this amendment  build down at the same time. The So viets  have  already modernized  and  they do not have that same require ment.  I am just really worried about what  we are getting ourselves into.  When the Levitas amendment was  actually a  substitute  for  the  freeze  and,  therefore, was more a political  ploy to do away with the freeze, I was  prepared  to  support  it,  to be very  honest with you, because I knew, had  it been adopted, the leadership would  have pulled the resolution from  the  floor and there would have been no  further action.  But, now we find a different animal.  Now we have a perfecting amendment  to the freeze and that makes it a far  more serious matter. In my opinion,  and I think we ought to pay close at tention to not the politics of it but ex actly what does this do to our strategic  position relative to the Soviet Union. I  think  it  is more  serious  than  the  freeze itself.  ",1983
106,House,98,-0.32,168,7,Mr. ASPIN.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Florida has made exactly  the point  that I was going to make, and I think  that the object of a 2-for-1 builddown  is in itself an interesting idea, but we  need some hearings on the idea. We  need  to state exactly what kinds of  systems we are going to be interested  in producing  in order  to have  that  builddown.  I think it would be very, very risky  to do  this resolution,  to put this as  part of the freeze resolution.  Just in response to the comment of  the gentleman from Illinois, the freeze  is not exactly the same leap  in the  dark that the Levitas amendment is.  We did, as I understand it, have hear ings in the appropriate committees.  ",1983
107,House,98,0.312,181,7,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I am just as weary as  anybody  in  this  room and maybe a  little more so of debating this issue. It  is  absolutely,  positively  a  political  issue, not arms control, and never was  that more  graphically  underscored  than by  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Iowa, which I am  sure is consonant with the dictates of  ""the freeze movement.""  Notice the absence of a ""reductions  movement."" Notice the hangup on the  word ""freeze"" which, of course, stops  modernization, keeps us in the antique  category as far as our weaponry is con cerned, and prevents us from respond ing to the SS-20's, 354  triple-headed  SS-20's aimed at Western Europe.  There is no reason in logic or in com monsense why you cannot reduce as  well as freeze.  Why in the world are you so hung  up on ""first we  freeze and  then we  reduce""?  The gentleman f;rom  Iowa has just  said our European allies want us to be  forthcoming on arms  control. Why  chose the door and just say talk about  freeze first? Why not leave the option  to reduce?  Is  there  something  incompatible  with  arms  control, with  fostering  peace, that says you cannot reduce?  What if the Soviets want to reduce?  We cannot talk to them?  We are going to have to negotiate a  freeze first.  Freezing first requires negotiations  on inventory, on verification. If you  think verification is going to be easy to  negotiate, you do not understand the  subject.  If you ask anyone in the intelligence  community how many atom bombs  Israel has, do you know what answer  you get? It is from zero to 200. We do  not know. That is a  little country, a  free country  the size of a  postage  stamp compared to Russia, and we do  not know.  But now we are going to verify nu clear weapons production and deploy ment in the Soviet Union.  To negotiate  the verification will  take years. What nonsense to foreclose  our negotiators from being able to dis cuss reductions.  The President no  longer can say,  ""We will cut it in two; we will elimi nate this; we will eliminate that."" We  have got to freeze first.  That  is not  forthcoming. That  is  stupid. I cannot see why you have to  march to the drum of the freeze move ment because they are hung up on the  word ""freeze.""  Reductions, disappearance of all nu clear weapons, ought to be the ulti mate goal. Why not at least let that  word  creep  into  the  resolution  by  saying  that,  too,  is an objective of  what we are doing.  I yield back the balance of my time.  I  is  Objection  CHAIRMAN.

109,House,98,-0.291,194,7,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of House Joint Resolu tion 13, a deserving initiative calling  for negotiations toward a mutual and  verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons to  be followed by equitable reductions in  strategic systems. It is my belief that  the resolution before us today conveys  the deep concern of those we repre sent about the arms race. The continu ing buildup of  the nuclear arsenals  places the prospect for true arms re duction further and further from our  grasp. It is  time to at least attempt  through negotiation to halt the esca lating nuclear arms race before we are  powerless to do so.  One  provision  of  the  resolution  which I strongly endorse states that,  ""Negotiations toward a freeze should  give special attention to destabilizing  weapons, especailly those which give  either nation capabilities which confer  upon it even the hypothetical advan tage of a first strike."" In an interesting  parallel, the report of the President's  Commission on Strategic Force advo cates similar emphasis in arms control  negotiations by  recommending  that,  ""We should try to promote an evolu tion toward forces in which each side  is encouraged to see to the survivabil ity of its own forces in a way that does  not threaten the other."" I believe that  negotiations toward a mutual and veri fiable  freeze must begin now, and I  strongly encourage my colleagues  to  join me in voting for the resolution.e  e ",1983
110,House,98,-0.351,194,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  House considers today a unique propo sition. Unique not because of its mag nitude, its subject, or because of the  controversy surrounding it. The pro posal  for  a mutual  and  verifiable  freeze on the testing, production and  deployment  of  nuclear weapons  unique  in  its origin,  its momentum,  and in the fact that no matter what  we here today decide to do with it, it  will eventually succeed. The American  people are behind it, united in a way  as  they have not been since World  War II. They will not be denied.  We  here  in Washington did not  think of the freeze. We did not pro pose it to our constituents. They have  presented it to us, and have demanded  its passage by this House. The beauty  of the freeze resolution is its simpliciis  ty. Clearly, it could never have been  developed  in one of our committee  rooms. One does not need a lawyer or  a defense analyst to understand it. My  constituents understand it. They un derstand that despite 40 years of com plicated solutions to the arms race, we  are less safe than ever before. They  understand that the testing, produc tion, and deployment of nuclear arms  has  to be stopped.  I support House  Joint Resolution 13 because I think it  is a good idea, but more importantly  because  I was  instructed  to by  the  people of the Fifth District of Iowa. I  am certain that if every Member of  this House voted as  the majority of  their constituents want them to, this  resolution would pass.  Now is the perfect time to adopt a  freeze, for the United States to negoti ate one with the Soviet Union. Our nu clear forces are in a state of rough  equivalency with the Soviet Union. We  have more  strategic  nuclear war heads-9,600 versus 8,000. We have  twice as many  tactical nuclear war heads-20,000 versus 10,000. Our sub marine missile force is far larger, more  accurate, and more reliable. We have  more long-range bombers, with greater  range and better avionics. There are  U.S. nuclear forces within range of the  U.S.S.R.  in Europe and  the Pacific,  the Soviets have nothing comparable.  Most importantly, we maintain a nu clear arsenal balanced between  the  land, air, and sea; 70 percent of the  Soviet  strategic  nuclear  forces  are  based on land, making them almost  completely dependent on forces most  vulnerable  to a surprise attack. The  Soviets have four potential nuclear ad versaries-the United States, Britain,  France, and China-and is surrounded  by potential enemies. We have peace ful borders and only one potential ad versary in a nuclear war.  Russia has some advantages. Their  ICBM's are larger and usually carry  more powerful warheads. They have  more  land-based and sea-based mis siles, and more strategic delivery vehi cles, although the United States still  leads in total warheads since our mis siles are heavily MIRV'ed. They also  have a greater total explosive power,  or megatonnage. These advantages are  really symptoms of a force that makes  up with size and power what it lacks in  accuracy and reliability.  All of  this adds up  to a state of  rough equivalency. Before we start on  a new arms race, let us stop now while  we are ahead. Let us stop now before  there comes the day when survivors of  a nuclear war pick through the radio active rubble and wonder who was the  winner.  Some have other  ideas. Over and  over, we  hear  the  call,  sometimes  plaintive and sometimes strident, for  reductions  in nuclear  forces  rather  than the freeze. Under the misleading  ",1983

Because  it  important  for  the  United States  to maintain as broad  contact as possible with a wide cross section of Palestinian groups and lead ers, the United States cannot ignore  the Village Leagues. It is hoped that  current policy of not meeting with Vil lage League officials will be reviewed  in the coming months. Such a meeting  can take place without conveying sup port for  the Village Leagues or  its  members. The Village Leagues will ul timately obtain power and legitimacy  is  April 13, 1983  only through solid support within the  Palestinian community and not from  meetings with American diplomats.  The correspondence follows:  COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., March 1, 1983.  Hon. GEORGE P. SHULTZ,  Secretary, Department of State, Washington,  D.C.  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I had the opportuni ty recently to meet with Mustafa Dudeen  and other officials of the Israeli-sponsored  West Bank Village Leagues while they were  in Washington.  I have tended to support the elected offi cials of the Palestinians, but I nonetheless  feel  that it is  important that the United  States maintain as broad contact as possible  with as many Palestinian  individuals and  Palestinian  organizations  as  possible.  I  would like to know why United States offi cials, even at a low level, will not meet with  Mr. Dudeen or other officials of the Village  Leagues. I believe it is in our interest to be  talking to as wide a spectrum of Palestinian  opinions as we possibly can.  I  appreciate your consideration of  this  letter and hope that you will give serious  consideration to the possibility of a meeting  with Mr. Dudeen  in  the  future. Such a  meeting would be conducted without con veying any sense of support for the Village  Leagues or its specific members.  I look forward to hearing from you on this  matter in the near future.  With best regards,  Sincerely yours,  LEE H. HAMILTON,  Chairman, Subcommittee on  Europe and the Middle East.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE  Washington, D.C., March 24, 1983.  DEAR MR.  IIAMILTON: This is  in reply to  your letter of March 1,  in which you ask  why United States officials, even at a  low  level,  have  not met with Mr. Mustafa  Dudeen or other officials of  the  Israeli sponsored West Bank Village Leagues.  As a matter of policy and principle, we  very much agree with your comment that it  is important that the United States main tain as broad contact as possible with a wide  range of Palestinian individuals and organi zations. Within this context, however, it is  our obligation to assess what impact meet ing with, or not meeting with, a given indi vidual or organization will have on our over arching  interest  in  achieving  expanded  peace negotiations on the basis of the Presi dent's September 1 initiative.  As you are aware, Mr. Dudeen and the Vil lage Leagues are widely perceived on the  West Bank and elsewhere as being key ele ments of a concerted Israeli effort to dis credit and strip away the influence of the  elected local Arab leadership. This leader ship  includes both the mayors who have  been removed from office and those who  have been expelled from the area <notably,  Mohammed Milhem of Halhul and Fuad  Kawasme of Hebron> by the Israeli authori ties. Much as we disagree with many of the  positions held by these leaders, we frankly  do not believe it would serve our larger in terest if we were to seem to acquiesce in or  lend sustenance to the active effort to sup plant them with Village League figures. It is  our judgment that such would inevitably be  the  implication of  a meeting with Mr.  Dudeen or his colleagues at this delicate  stage.  ",1983
113,,98,-0.422,259,7,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, please  allow me the privilege of reprinting, in  the RECORD, for the benefit of my col leagues  the  report  entitled,  ""The  Report of the Secretary General on  the Work of the Organization""-1982.  The Secretary General of the United  Nations, Javier De Cuellar, points out  in his eloquent and learned address his  belief  that  the only way  for world  peace to exist is when the five perma nent members of the Security Council  resolve their differences and use their  power collectively to prevent war, as  they agreed  to do  in writing when  each signed the U.N. Charter. I think  we could all benefit by thoughtfully  considering  the Secretary General's  remarks.  The report follows:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  [Original: English, September 19821  REPORT OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL ON THE  WoRK OF THE ORGANIZATION  The past year has seen an alarming suc cession of  international crises as well as  stalemates on a number of  fundamental  international  issues. The United Nations  itself has been unable to play as effective  and decisive a role as the Charter certainly  envisaged for it. Therefore, in this, my first  annual report to the General Assembly, I  shall depart from the usual practice of sur veying the broad range of the work of the  United Nations; instead I shall focus on the  central problem of the Organization's capac ity  to keep  the peace and  to serve as a  forum for negotiations. I shall try to ana lyse its evident difficulties in doing so, diffi culties related to conflicts between national  aims and Charter goals and to the current  tendency  to  resort  to confrontation, vio lence and even war in pursuit of what are  perceived as vital interests, claims or aspira tions. The general  international divisions  and disorder which have characterized the  past year have unquestionably made it even  more difficult than usual for the Organiza tion to be, as it was intended to be, a centre  for harmonizing the actions of nations in  the attainment of common ends.  The problems faced by the United Nations  in fulfilling its mission derive in large meas ure  from  the difficulties which Govern ments appear to have in coming to terms,  both within and outside the Organization,  with the harsh realities of the time in which  we live. This question is, of course, highly  relevant to the use, misuse or non-use of the  United Nations as an instrument for peace  and rational change.  I am of the view that we now have poten tially better means  to solve many of the  major problems facing humanity than ever  before. For this reason I retain, in the last  analysis, a sense of optimism. This basic op timism, however, is tempered by our appar ent inability to make adequate use of these  means. Instead we sometimes appear still to  be in the grip of the dead hand of a less for tunate past. As a result we often lack the  vision  to differentiate between short-term  advantage and long-term progress, between  politically expedient positions and the indis pensable objective of creating a civilized and  peaceful world order. While such attitudes  do not affect the validity of the ideals of the  Charter, they seriously impair the proper  utilization of the machinery of the United  Nations for the purposes for which it was  set up.  We live today in the presence of a chilling  and unprecedented phenomenon. At  the  peak of world power there exist enough nu clear weapons to destroy life on our planet.  It seems evident that nothing worthwhile  would survive such a holocaust, and  this  fact, above all else, contains  the nuclear  confrontation-for the time being at least.  In the middle level of world power there  exist vast quantities of sophisticated, so called  conventional weapons.  Indeed we  have  seen  some of  them  in devastating  action this very year. These weapons are, by  comparison with those of former times, im mensely destructive, and they are actually  being used. They are also the objects of a  highly profitable international trade.  At yet another level we have the poverty  of a vast proportion of the world's popula tion-a deprivation  inexplicable  in  terms  either of  available  resources  or of  the  money and ingenuity spent on armaments  and war. We have unsolved but soluble  problems of economic relations, trade, dis8499  tribution of resources and technology. We  have many ideas and plans as  to how to  meet the growing needs of the large mass of  humanity, but somehow such human con siderations seem to take second place to the  technology and funding of violence and war  in the name of national security.  It is for these reasons that our peoples, es pecially the young,  take to the streets in  their hundreds of thousands in many parts  of the world to proclaim their peaceful pro test against the existing situation and their  deep fear of the consequences of the arms  race and nuclear catastrophe. Who can say  that these gentle protesters are wrong or  misguided? On the contrary, they recall us  to the standards and the duties which we  set ourselves in the Charter of the United  Nations. The States Members of this Orga nization should not ignore the significance  of what they are trying to say.  What in reality is the role and the capac ity of the United Nations in such a world?  Our Charter was born of six years of global  agony and destruction.  I  sometimes  feel  that we now take the Charter far less seri ously than did its authors, living as they did  in the wake of a world tragedy. I believe  therefore that an important first step would  be a conscious recominitment by Govern ments to the Charter.  Certainly we have strayed far from the  Charter in recent years. Governments that  believe they can win an international objec tive by force are often quite ready to do so,  and domestic opinion not infrequently ap plauds such a course. The Security Council,  the primary organ of the United Nations for  the maintenance of international peace and  security, all too often finds itself unable to  take decisive action to resolve international  conflicts and its resolutions are increasingly  defied or ignored by those that feel them selves strong enough to do so. Too frequent ly the Council seems powerless to generate  the support and influence to ensure that its  decisions are respected, even when these are  taken unanimously. Thus  the process of  peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed  in the Charter is often brushed aside. Stern er measures for world peace were envisaged  in Chapter VII of the Charter, which was  conceived as a key element of the United  Nations system of collective security, but  the prospect of realizing such measures is  now deemed almost impossible in our divid ed international community. We are peril ously near to a new international anarchy.  I believe that we are at present embarked  on an exceedingly dangerous course, one  symptom of which is the crisis in the multi lateral approach in international affairs and  the concomitant erosion of the authority  and status of world and regional intergov ernmental institutions. Above all, this trend  has adversely affected the United Nations,  the instrument that was created specifically  to prevent such a  self-destructive course.  Such a trend must be reversed before once  again we bring upon ourselves a global ca tastrophe and find ourselves without insti tutions effective enough to prevent it.  While I do not propose here to review in  detail specific situations and developments,  it is, of course, my deep concern about them  that leads me to examine the underlying de ficiencies of our present system. The trage dy of Lebanon and the imperative need to  resolve the problem of the Middle East in  all its aspects, including the legitimate right  of the Palestinians and the security of all  States in the region; the war between Iran  and Iraq; the political situation relating to  Afghanistan;  the prevailing convulsion of  ",1983

It  has great destinies, and I have no doubt,  will  ameliorate  the  condition  of man  throughout the world.""  The writer of  these  lines was Thomas  Addis Emmet, brother of the Irish patriot  Robert Emmet. His words, written when the  United States were just two generations old,  are strikingly perceptive. They are also typi cal"" of  the  faith and commitment which  countless Irish people before and after him  brought to this, their country of adoption.  Their energy, courage and skills contributed  much to  translating  into reality Emmet's  prophetic vision of the future greatness of  the United States. Today their descendants  immi are to be found in the highest offices of the  land and in every field of endeavour. Their  presence here constitutes a special bond be tween Ireland and the United States and  gives a special dimension to the relationship  between the two countries. From the very  beginning,  that relationship  is one which  has enriched both countries. As one histori an has written: ""An Irishman was among  the five who died in the Boston Massacre,  and eight signers of the Declaration of Inde pendence,  the secretary of Congress who  certified it, the officer who first read it to a  public gathering, and even the printer who  turned out the first copies were all Irish. born or  the descendants of  Irish  grants.""  If the Irish contributed significantly  to  the  establishment  of  this  nation,  the  achievements and the concern of the Irish  in  the United States were  a  source of  strength and encouragement to people  in  Ireland in times of difficulty and despond ency. The energies and  the capacity  for  hard work of the Irish people helped to lay  the first foundations of the prosperity of  the United States. Today the performance  of American corporations who generate em ployment  and  exports  in  Ireland  are  a  valued element in our  industrial develop ment. Our overall record of economic devel opment since independence has been a very  positive one. The average  Irish family  is  now three times better off than when the  State was  founded. Yet, as a small open  economy, Ireland has felt in full measure  the chill of the current world recession. The  Irish Government has taken the necessary  steps to ensure the future health of our  economy. We are determined to protect the  basis of our economic growth. Our current  difficulties can and will be overcome. They  are nevertheless real and painful. They add  to the importance for us of our economic  partnership with the United States. That  partnership is again one of mutual benefit.  The 350 U.S. corporations manufacturing in  Ireland enjoy  the benefits of a generous  system of incentives, access to the European  market, a consistent industrial policy and an  educated and highly motivated work force.  In spite of the climate of recession the aver age rate of return on investment in Ireland  by U.S. corporations is 31 percent. For us in  Ireland that partnership provides employ ment opportunities which are particularly  important because of our young and grow ing population. They are particularly appre ciated  in  a  country where  the painful  memory of widespread emigration is all too  recent.  My presence here in the United States on  this St. Patrick's Day is  to celebrate the  bonds of friendship between Ireland and the  United States-countries so different in his tory and scale, yet so akin in many of the  fundamental  values which  their peoples  hold dear. It is also to share with you our  concern on a problem which touches all of  us deeply, as it must touch all who have the  welfare of Ireland at heart. The continuing  and unresolved tragedy of Northern Ireland  casts a shadow over our celebration of the  joyful feast of the patron saint of Ireland.  Our many  friends  in  the United States  share our anguish at what  is happening.  They ask us: how has  this  tragedy come  about? Can it be resolved? Are there ways in  which we can help? Here on a day when in terest is focused on Ireland and in the cap ital city of a people whose sympathy and in terest in Ireland has been a cherished part  of our relationship, I would like to try to  answer those questions.  The Northern Ireland problem is a prod uct of the long and complex history of the  relationship between Britain and Ireland.  Its most recent manifestation arises from  the attempt made by Great Britain some  sixty years ago to resolve the problem of di vision of Irish opinion on the basis of a divi sion of Irish territory. It aimed to protect  the unionist minority in Ireland by creating  the new entity of Northern Ireland in which  the unionist community was ensured a local  majority. However,  that measure went  beyond the protection of a minority. To the  extent that it did so it sowed the seeds of in stability. It created a new minority-the na tionalist  population which  found  itself  dominated by the permanent unionist ma jority of Northern Ireland. Each of the two  communities in Northern Ireland is deter mined to avoid permanent minority status whether as a nationalist minority in North ern Ireland or a unionist minority in Ireland  as a whole. It is that which gives the con flict its particular bitterness.  Nationalist opinion in Ireland opposed the  partition of  Ireland. It believes  that the  elimination of division between  the  two  parts of Ireland is an important goal. But  there are two sharply different perceptions  of how this can be attained. There are two  fundamentally divergent approaches to the  problem of ending the division between the  two Irish traditions which partition cast in  territorial form.  In recent years in Ireland we have seen  the effect of a destructive approach which  has systematically attacked the links which  tie North and South together. It has done  so on the level of physical infrastructure. It  has done so in relation to the personal and  commercial relations which draw people of  the two parts of Ireland together. That is  the approach of the IRA. There is the con structive approach which seeks to hold on  to  the bonds between North and South  which already exist in many fields of endea vour. That is the policy of the Irish Govern ment.  There is a form of nationalism that has  been frozen or warped by the burden of past  history. It is so vengeful and narrow as to be  rejected by the great majority of nationalist  people living in Ireland, not to speak of the  unionist community. That is the outlook of  the IRA. There is a spirit of Irish national ism which is generous and forward-looking.  It seeks to accommodate the basic concerns  of all the people living on the island of Ire land in a spirit of reconciliation and harmo ny. That is the philosophy of the Irish Gov ernment and  the majority of  the  Irish  people.  There is an approach which invokes the  rhetoric of Irish unity to justify a campaign  of violence  in N orthem Ireland which  is  tribal and sectarian  in practice. A recent  survey showed that in Northern Ireland one  Protestant in four now has personal experi ence of the killing or serious injury of a rel ative or personal friend. The victims are  most often gunned down while about their  daily business-a police officer murdered in  sight of the children he was helping across  the road, a postman shot delivering a letter  which had been mailed to lure him to an  isolated farmhouse, a bible teacher killed in  front of his class, a school bus driver mur dered  in  the presence of his passengers.  These are recent additions to a long litany  of victims. Each and every such atrocity  gives  fresh  intensity  to  the  fears  and  hatreds which-on  anyone's definition must be dismantled  if  Irish unity  is  to  become a reality.

115,,98,-0.308,285,7,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, six mem bers of the House Ways and Means'  Subcommittee on Trade recently trav eled to Japan to meet with officials of  the Japanese Government. We went to  Japan as  legislators, not diplomats,  and while our delegation did not cause  an earthquake, we did send tremors  through Japanese Government and in dustrial  circles. Our message was  simple and direct: ""Trade must be a  two-way street.""  This is the topic that I addressed in  my most  recent weekly  newspaper  column. It follows.  WASHINGTON REPORT  <By Don J. Pease, U.S. Congressman, 13th  District>  No  earthquake was  registered, but  the  House Ways and Means Committee's Trade  Subcommittee definitely caused some rum bles in Japan during a series of Easter week  meetings with Japanese officials.  In meeting after meeting, the six-member  delegation of which I was a part pounded  away at the Japanese government for keep ing American products out of Japan while  helping their companies penetrate the U.S.  market.  We six congressmen went to Japan as leg islators, not diplomats,  and we  saw  no  reason for diplomatic pussy-footing around  the issues.  ""The political consensus for free trade has  been destroyed in America largely because  of  resentment of Japan,""  thundered one  member of our delegation to Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone.  In a heated discussion with Japanese For eign Minister Shintaro Abe, one of our  Trade Subcommittee members was fuming:  ""I've listened to your excuses about autos,  and I don't buy them. I've listened for 15  years to your excuses on oranges and beef  restrictions, and I don't buy them.""  The Japanese were well aware of my role  as a principal sponsor in the Congress of the  automobile  domestic  content  bill which  would require cars sold in the United States  to have a high content of U.S.-made parts.  The bill's passage in the House of RepreEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sentatives last year and its reintroduction  this year have the Japanese scrambling to  ease some of their barriers to U.S. products  going into Japan.  Thus, the Japanese were not surprised at  my insistence that U.S. autos should be able  to enter the Japanese market as freely as  Japanese cars enter our country. But Japa nese officials were impressed by the strong  support I got from Sam Gibbons, D-Florida,  chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, and  other members of our delegation who had  opposed the domestic content bill.  Referring to political pressures building in  the United States, one member said, ""I'm a  free  trader with no apologies, but we're  about to be overwhelmed.""  The Japanese were also impressed when  two other congressmen from non-automo bile areas joined me in pressing for a fourth  year of voluntary restraint on the part of  Japanese automakers exporting cars to the  United States.  All in all, I felt it was a great team effort  on the part of our six-member delegation in  dealing with not only auto, orange, beef and  cigarette  restrictions, but also with vital  broader issues like Japanese targetting of  U.S.  industries and the undervaluation of  the yen <which makes Japanese cars 20 per cent cheaper in the United States than they  would be if the yen were properly valued>.  Most importantly, we got to deliver our  strong message to absolutely the top people  in Japan. In addition to the prime minister  and foreign minister we had long meetings  with the chief cabinet minister, with the  minister of finance, with  the minister of  trade, with leaders of the ruling political  party in Japan, and with the presidents of  all of the auto manufacturers in Japan.  Nor did we  forget  the public. In a 75minute press conference for Japanese and  American reporters, the same points were  emphasized. The next day, all of the major  Japanese  newspapers  carried  prominent  news stories.  As I say, our Trade Subcommittee delega tion didn't cause an earthquake, but we did  send a few  tremors reverberating through  Japanese government and industrial circles.  The messages: ""Trade must be a  two-way  street.""e  MARY DETERT-CYCLING  AGAINST CANCER '83  HON. JOHN HILER  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983   ",1983
116,,98,0.413,285,7,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Speaker, William  Arthur Ward once spoke of achieving  the impossible.  If we can imagine, he said, we can  achieve. If we can dream, we can make  it real.  Mrs. Mary Detert, a South Bend citi zen, is trying to prove that Mr. Ward  was correct. She  is chairman of an  event that is being held on May 1,  ""Cycling Against Cancer '83."" She is  spearheading  this 8-mile bike-a-thon  in an effort to raise funds for St. Jude  Childrens Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,  her contribution in the effort to fight  leukemia.  The reasons that she is so involved  in this effort are personal. Her sister  8525  died of  this dreaded disease at  the  young age of 16. Mary was so moved  by her battle for life that she has dedi cated herself to help others in their  own personal wars against leukemia.  Mr. Speaker, Mary Detert is one of  the everyday heroines of our society.  Her only reward is that she may be  able,  through her own efforts and  leadership,  to  help  raise  enough  money that might just lead to a cure  for this disease.  Mary Detert is one of the reasons  that despite  the recession  last year,  charitable  contributions  increased.  She is one of the reasons that Ameri cans are known as one of the most  compassionate peoples on this Earth.  She holds no illusions about her ef forts. She knows that leukemia is a  difficult and ominous enemy, particu larly of children. But she believes in  miracles, and I am confident that her  efforts will not go unrewarded. Her ef forts and the efforts of hundreds like  her are our best hope in the effort to  cure many of our Nation's ills.  I know St. Jude Childrens Hospital  appreciates her efforts, and I urge all  my colleagues to join me in honoring  Mary Detert  for  her unselfish  ef forts.e  ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT  AND  INDUSTRIAL REVITALIZA TION ACT OF 1983  HON.HENRYJ.NOWAK  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983   ",1983
117,,98,-0.332,285,7,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker, our Na tion's older cities are facing the pros pect of long-term economic deteriora tion. The demise of our country's in dustrial base, persistently high unem ployment and the plight of our dis placed workers are dramatic symbols  of the grim problems encountered by  these urban centers.  In light of these serious economic  problems, on March 23, 1983, I intro duced  the Enterprise Development  and  Industrial Revitalization Act of  1983. This act is a refined version of  the Enterprise Development Act of  1981, as well as being an active  re sponse to the recommendations of the  report on job creation and the revital ization of small business released by  my Subcommittee on Tax, Access  to  Equity Capital and Business Opportu nities.  These  investigations  reemphasized  the  importance of  targeting aid  to  small-and medium-sized businesses in  distressed areas, particularly  in our  older urban centers. This development  process  encompasses  procedures  to  insure a viable infrastructure base, up front  incentives  for  investment  plant and equipment and for working  capital.  in  ",1983

119,Senate,98,-0.145,350,7,Mr. NUNN.,"  In my  judgment, Dr.  Adelman has demonstrated in his writ ings, his testimony for the most part,  and his experience that he is a bright,  capable individual.  Were  this debate occurring at the  beginning of the Reagan administra tion, I have no doubt that Dr. Adel man would  be  confirmed  by  the  Senate with  little  controversy  and  would be in a position to make a real  contribution  to  the administration's  arms control policies. That is obvious ly not the case today.  While Dr. Adelman has the requisite  capabilities to do a good job at ACDA  under  normal  circumstances,  these  times are not normal.  In my mind,  then, the issue is not really Dr. Adel man's integrity or his capabilities. The  issue is the long-term best interests of  this country in the arms control arena.  There  is a growing focus, both  in  this country and abroad, of the need  to move arms control to the front and  center in the search for peace and sta bility. There is a growing pressure and  impatience for some signs of progress  and  continuity.  In  fairness,  the  Reagan administration has put  for ward several sound proposals in this  area. From the outset of this adminis tration, however, the path to progress  has been  littered with unwarranted  and  unneeded  rhetoric which  has  caused considerable controversy and  confusion both  in  this country and  abroad. For  every  step  forward  it  seems we take two steps backward.  Arms control in 1983  is one of our  most important foreign policy objec tives. More than ever before, other im portant foreign policy and national se curity goals are intertwined with our  arms  control proposals. Progress  in  this area, which is essential to many of  our national security objectives, de pends on the European citizenry, as  well as our own, believing  that this  country's leadership  is serious about  arms control. If the European public is  not convinced, then the European po litical leaders are going to have diffi culty deploying . the Pershing II and  ground launched cruise missiles. If the  Soviets perceive that NATO will not  deploy those missiles, there will not be  an  intermediate range nuclear force  agreement. If we do not reach an INF  agreement, the prospects for START  diminish considerably. We are  in a  battle for the hearts and minds of the  European public as well as the Ameri can public. It is  important that our  friends  and our  adversaries  believe  that U.S. arms control policies have  broad bipartisan support with continu ity from administration to administra tion. The Adelman nomination and  this debate certainly does not encour age that belief.  I would have preferred that Presi dent Reagan withdraw Dr. Adelman's  nomination without  prejudice  and  nominate someone who would enjoy a  broad bipartisan  consensus. Despite  his  impressive general qualifications,  Dr. Adelman has admitted that he is  not a recognized expert with interna tional standing  in  the arms control  field. The President, however, as is his  prerogative, has not withdrawn  this  nomination, and  the Senate  is now  faced with deciding between two unde sirable choices: Confirming or defeat ing the nomination by a small margin.  In my view, our Nation loses either  way.  Mr. President, I am convinced that  there will be no success in arms con trol unless the Soviets are firmly con vinced that U.S. arms control policies  have continuity and strong bipartisan  support  and will  not  significantly  change  in  1985 whether President  Reagan is  in office or not. This is a  major challenge for  the Reagan ad ministration during the remainder of  this term.  In my judgment, the Adelman nomi nation is a move away from this essen tial national goal.  I will,  therefore,  vote ""no"" on this confirmation.  Whatever  the outcome of  today's  vote, it is imperative that both the ad ministration and Congress begin to ap proach our national security and arms  control policies on a bipartisan basis.  Unless this is done, there will be little  chance of providing continuity in our  arms control efforts.  Mr. President, I yield back the re mainder of my  time  to  the Senator  from Rhode Island.

120,Senate,98,-0.214,350,7,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my friend, the ranking member on the  Foreign Relations Committee.  Mr. President, I have been agonizing  over this vote for a long time. Unfortu nately, I have been tied up the last  few days with the night-and-day ses sions in the Senate Budget Committee  and therefore have not been able to be  on the floor to the extent that I would  have liked to listen to the debate to  try and help  inform me on how  I  should vote on this nomination.  As I said when I was on the floor a  couple of days ago and had a chance  to listen to some of the debate then,  during that time I became involved in  the debate and I said I felt that prob ably this was the most important vote  or one of the most  important votes  ",1983
121,Senate,98,-0.426,376,7,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I think  it is a sad day for America that Ken neth Adelman's nomination was con firmed by the Senate. Now that he is  in this position, the only way we can  remove  him  is  by  removing Mr.  Reagan  from  the Presidency.  I  am  very much of the opinion that in 1984  our Nation, for a variety of reasons,  will take that step and we will in fact  elect a new President. In so doing, we  will not only put the Presidency into  new  and more  capable  hands  but  afford ourselves  the chance  to  then  select on behalf of our Nation some one to head the arms control effort  who brings the qualification and the  professional standing and the aware ness of the issues that this vital, abso lutely critical issue requires.  In a sense, I suppose the confirma tion today draws the issue even more  clearly, and that is the problem of a  lack of movement on arms control and  in the end is a problem of inadequate  Presidential leadership.  I think it is time for us now to deal  with  the  problem-of  President  Reagan; when this term is up, to re place him with a President that can  perform this job at a higher standard  and in a much better way.  ",1983
122,,98,0.233,441,7,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  December 1981, and again in February  1983, I  introduced legislation to stop  the erroneous payments of social secu rity benefits to deceased persons. Re cently this bill was included as section  337  in H.R. 1900, the Social Security  Act Amendments of 1983.  Section 337 requires the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to gather  from the States a data base of each  certificate information, set up a com puter system with  the data base  to  cross-check beneficiary records, identi fy  through  computer matches  de ceased people on benefit  roles and,  after validating the computer identifi cation of a deceased person,  remove  the deceased person from the roles.  The provision also allows Health and  Human Services  to share  the data,  under specified safeguards, with other  Federal agencies and  the States. As  many as 10 Federal agencies can bene fit from the use of this data to purge  deceased  recipients from  their roles.  All of the States can use the data to  tighten  up  various  State-run  pro grams.  The key legislative provision of sec tion 337, without which the Social Se curity Administration <SSA) has been  unable to establish a computer s~stem  using death certificate data, is an ex-  elusion of the death certificate data  from the Freedom of Information and  Privacy Acts. This  exclusion  allows  States with confidentiality laws which  prohibit the public disclosure of death  certificate information to release the  information without breaching such  laws. The Freedom of Information Act  <FOIA) grants the public legal access  to  any Federal  agency  documents,  except  those  important for national  security. Without an exclusion from  FOIA, the public could obtain death  certificate data from SSA and  then  the States'  laws  could be violated.  With an exclusion from  this act for  the death certificate data, the States  will be willing to let SSA use the data  since the exclusion protects the data  from public disclosure and their laws  would not be violated.  The drafting and passage of this sec tion were aided greatly by the work of  SSA, the National Center for Health  Statistics,  the State  registrars,  the  General Accounting Office <GAO) and  Senator ROBERT DOLE. Of particular  note were pilot projects which SSA  and GAO each developed based on the  methodology suggested by H.R. 5188,  which I  introduced in the 97th Con gress. Both pilots  found  significant  numbers of deceased persons on bene fit roles. SSA's pilot found millions of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dollars in social security payments to  the deceased, while GAO found death  fraud in nine different Federal agen cies. These studies showed the efficacy  of H.R. 5188 and helped insure its pas sage.  The legislative history of H.R. 5188  may be of interest. The bill was made  a part of the Miscellaneous Social Se curity Act Amendments of 1982, after  the Social Security Administration tes tified in support of H.R. 5188 during  hearings on the miscellaneous amend ments in December 1982. The bill sub sequently was made a part of the Mis cellaneous Social Security Act Amend ments of 1983, which in turn was writ ten  into H.R.  1900.  Senator DoLE  added an amended version of the bill,  incorporating suggestions by GAO and  SSA, into S. 1, the Senate social secu rity reform legislation. Then, finally,  that version was adopted in the House Senate conference on H.R. 1900.  The legislation becomes effective on  January 1, 1984. My only concern now  is  its effective  implementation. The  bill purposefully gives the Secretary of  Health and Human Services some dis cretion in determining which Federal  agency should maintain the data bank.  The most likely place for the data  bank is SSA itself, because SSA will  have the greatest use for the informa tion. The other major alternative  is  the National Center for Health Statis tics <NCHS) because NCHS now al ready maintains a data bank contain ing some of the death certificate infor mation needed for the section 337 data  bank.  I have been working with GAO and  SSA to provide some oversight of the  implementation of  the bill and am  pleased  to  note  that Health  and  Human Services is proceeding quickly.  I will continue to follow the agency's  progress closely; section 337  requires  Health and Human Services to report  on  the  section's  implementation  in  1984 and I am hopeful that by that  time the system will be in place.e  THE B-52: AN AGING WARRIOR  HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983  e ",1983
123,,98,-0.306,454,7,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  bring to the attention of this body the  roguish and  irresponsible manner  in  which the Interstate Commerce Com mission is implementing provisions of  the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.  During our consideration of this rail road reform legislation, I and others  worked  to strike a balance between  the revenue interests of the railroads  with those of coal and other captive  shippers by maintaining an appropri ate degree of rate regulation. Since en actment of  the Staggers Rail Act,  I  have watched as the Commission con sidered and decided how to interpret  and promulgate key provisions of the  act. I have repeatedly called for con gressional oversight hearings on this  process. And, I have issued alerts when  I felt the Commission was ignoring the  intent of the law.  However,  these  efforts  and  the  intent of Congress to provide captive  shipper protections,  have  been  for  naught. The ICC has taken a cavalier  attitude  toward  implementing provi sions of the act meant to protect cap tive shippers from monopolistic pric ing practices and has mounted a cam paign  to administratively deregulate  rail pricing  for captive  traffic;  that  traffic which lacks viable transporta tion alternatives and is captive to the  railroads. In a number of proceedings  the ICC has subverted the meaning of  market dominance,  sanctioned  a  15  percent per year increase above infla tion on coal movements, has deter mined that captive, or market domi nant, movements may be made to pay  for other less profitable traffic carried  by  the  railroads and has exempted  from any  type of  regulation export  coal to the east, gulf and west coasts.  To the detriment of coal producers  and users such as the utility industry  which purchases about 80 percent of  all coal produced and depends on this  coal for 52 percent of its electrical gen eration, the ICC's various and sundry  actions have lead to:  Unrealistic and illegal definition of  rail market dominance by  including  product and geographic competition,  leaving  captive  shippers with  little  prospect for recourse before the Com mission;  Adoption  of  a  cross-subsidization  scheme which  enables  a  carrier  to  charge a disproportionate amount of  its fixed costs to captive shippers so  that it can move  less profitable and  more competitive traffic;  A ruling that rail rates on coal may  increase by the arbitrary amount of 15  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  percent per year above  inflation de spite  the fact  that Congress  in  the  Staggers Rail Act already provided for  inflation-based increases and a zone of  rate flexibility which allows an addi tional 6 percent per year increase;  Unrealistic definition of railroad rev enue adequacy based solely on the cur rent cost of capital, despite past use of  other relevant tools of financial analy sis, which has resulted in the determi nation that only two class I railroads  are revenue adequate; and  Exemption from regulation of coal  export  traffic despite  the  fact  that  U.S. coal is already 15  to 20 percent  more expensive on the world market  largely due to transportation costs.  In short, the ICC has declared an  open season on capitive coal  traffic.  Already faced with escalating railroad  transportation costs-a 50-percent in crease over the past 3 years-coal ship pers and the electric utility and export  markets  they serve have nothing  to  look  forward  to  for  effective  relief  from oppressive market conditions. At  stake is the basic fabric of a sound na tional energy policy. Over 65 percent  of all coal produced is transported by  rail with 85 percent of  this amount  captive  to  the  railroads. Without a  doubt, higher transportation costs for  electric utilities using coal to generate  over 52 percent of the Nation's elec tricity will be passed on to the con sumer.  According to a recent study conduct ed by the National Economic Research  Associates, Inc., deregulated rail trans portation rates for coal would be any where from 30  to 60 percent higher  than regulated rates. In 1981, the rail roads earned about $6 billion in reve nues  for hauling coal with coal ac counting for 27 percent of carloadings  and 20 percent of gross freight reve nues. Of this $6 billion, electric utili ties paid about $4.7 billion. The NERA  study indicates that if coal rates were  deregulated in 1981,  this would have  translated into an extra delivered coal  cost to utilities of between $1.4 to $2.8  billion, by 1990, an extra $2 to $4 bil lion. It should be noted that currently  on the average 30 percent of the deliv ered price of coal to a utility is due to  railroad transportation costs.  Mr. Speaker, I submit that this  is  not the scenario Congress envisioned  in enacting the Staggers Rail Act of  1980. The act was intended to provide  the financial mechanism for the resto ration, maintenance, and improvement  of  the rail system. The shortage of  capital to invest in rail plant has large ly disappeared and  the major coal hauling  railroads  are  now  in  fact  highly profitable:  April 1#,, 1983  [In percent]  Railroad and coal revenues  revenue)  (total  Profitability  (return on equity)  Growth  (earnings  per share)  Burlington Northern  (29.4) .................  csx Corp.

Now, it is time to attend to an other purpose of the act, that of pro viding captive shipper protections.  Today,  I  am  introducing  amend ments to title 49 which will accomplish  this task. In light of the recent deci sions made  by  the  ICC-decisions  which  run  roughshod  over  captive  shippers-it appears it is time to clari fy what exactly is meant by market  dominance,  provide  commonsense  business  standards  for  determining  revenue adequacy and insert addition al guidance with respect to developing  standards for rail rates. In no way do  these amendments run counter to the  intent  of  the  Staggers Rail Act.  Rather,  they enhance and  reinforce  the provisions of this act intended to  protect captive shippers.  The  amendments would  establish  three basic tests in the determination  of market dominance. As  in current  law, making  a  showing  of market  dominance  is a prerequisite  for  the  ICC to investigate a rate. The first test  is  the revenue-to-variable cost ratios  which establish the threshold for ICC  jurisdiction over rail rates contained in  the Staggers Rail Act. Second,  the  Commission would consider whether  the shipper has a substantial invest ment  in  railroad  related plant and  equipment and third, whether 70 per cent or more of a specific movement  was handled by the rail carrier. The  latter two tests were used by the Com mission prior to its recent proceeding  on market dominance in which it de cided to include both product and geo graphic competition during consider ation of the presence of market domi nance.  It should be made clear  that  the  Staggers Rail Act did not require a  change in approach to market domi nance and in fact retained the defini tion of market dominance contained in  the 4-R Act <Railroad Revitalization  and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976).

124,Senate,98,0.213,493,7,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  today I am submitting a resolution to  promote U.S. agricultural and other  exports by opposing unnecessary re strictions and  regulations developed  and administered by international or ganizations.  On March 22, I reported to this body  that I had expressed my concerns to  Secretary of State George P. Shultz  about  recent  developments  in  the  United Nations  that could adversely  affect exports of American products,  especially  agricultural  commodities  and finished goods.  My concerns  focused generally on  the dramatic increase in the number  and scope of U.N. attempts to regulate  or otherwise influence our internation al trade, and my specific concern was  the proposed worldwide consumer pro tection guidelines pending before the  U.N. Economic and Social Council. As  Ambassador  Jeane  J.  Kirkpatrick  stated in her article, ""Global Paternal ism,"" published in the January /Febru ary 1983 issue of Regulation:  Attempts  to deal with  these problems  [health and safety] within the U.N., howev er, too often are caught up, in a very crude  kind of anti-capitalist ideology that is more  concerned with restricting and discrediting  multinational/transnational corporations.  Mr. President, this is a subject that  should concern all of us in Congress  from a jurisdictional, as well as a sub stantive, point of view. I chair two sub committees with  foreign  trade over sight responsibilities, and I represent a  State that has significant interests in  matters affecting foreign  trade. Yet,  neither I nor any similarly situated  colleague, to my knowledge, was given  direct notice of  the pendency  and  scope of these so-called consumer pro tection guidelines that !ire expressly  intended  to affect  the regulation of  both our foreign and domestic com merce.  Unless article I of the Constitution  was amended recently, Congress still  has exclusive jurisdiction over the reg ulation of American commerce here  and abroad. Yet, according to a State  Department response  to my original  letter, only the views of trade associa tions, consumer groups and Federal  agencies were directly solicited by the  executive branch  to approve  in  the  name of  the United States concepts  for regulating our commerce. What is  next-the signing of binding foreign  trade agreements without our review?  Mr. President, because of the impor tance of this subject to American agri culture, trade and this body's own con stitutional mandate, I ask unanimous  consent that the State Department's  response  to my original  inquiry be  printed at this point in the RECORD,  followed by my reply to that response,  and my most recent letter to Secretary  Shultz. My  original  five  questions  appear at page 6559 of the March 22,  1983 RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  Record, as follows:  DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  Washington, D.C., Aprill, 1983.  Hon. LARRY PRESSLER,  U.S. Senate.  I  DEAR SENATOR PRESSLER: Secretary Shultz  has asked me to respond to that portion of  your letter of March 10 which deals with  the draft United Nations ""Guidelines for  Consumer Protection.""  am pleased to enclose answers  to  the  specific questions which you asked. If you  wish additional details  from  the Depart ment of State, your staff should contact  William Brew, Special Assistant for Legisla tive, Consumer and Public Affairs; Bureau  of Economic and Business Affairs; Tele phone: 632-9310.  Sincerely,  ALVIN PAUL DRISCHLER,  Acting Assistant Secretary  for Congressional Relations.  With respect to the Draft U.N. Guidelines  for  Consumer  Protection  now  pending  before  the Economic and Social Council,  please answer the following questions sepa rately:  Q<a>: What is the present position of the  United States on these Guidelines, and how  was that decision arrived at?  A: The general approach of the comments  on the Guidelines, which were delivered to  the U.N. Secretariat on March 25, is recogni tion of the importance of the goal of con sumer  protection both  domestically  and  internationally,  but  skepticism  that  the  Guidelines are the best or only means of  achieving  that goal. Our comments dealt  with every section of the Guidelines, oppos ing some concepts, approving of others, and  raising  questions  about  the  remainder.  Copies of the Guidelines and the March 25  comments are enclosed.  The  comments were  developed  on an  interagency basis, with each agency com menting on sections of interest to it at meet ings or in writing. Each agency was provided  copies of public <usually trade association>  comments  that had  been  received. The  State Department served as the ""secretar iat"" for  this  interagency process, drafting  the comments on the basis of the views ex pressed.  Q<b>: What evaluations were made with  respect to the effect of the Guidelines,  if  implemented worldwide, on the export of  agricultural commodities?  A: No econometric or analogous analysis  of the potential impact of the Guidelines on  exports of agricultural commodities was at tempted. The draft Guidelines  focus,  in  part, on food products and national food  policies and, except for one significant ex ception, speak in fairly general terms; por tions of the Guidelines were reviewed for  consistency with U.S.  policies  in  similar  areas. The exception is a reference to highly  processed foods; as can be seen from the en closed comments, the negative reference to  such foods <which might be interpreted as  meaning value-added agricultural commod ities) was not accepted. Our opposition  is  ",1983

143,Senate,98,-0.443,558,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, just  to  respond,  I  do not  think anyone  denies the right of petition. I  think  the Senator from Kansas has probably  said  it the best. He said  the banks  have  the right to petition Congress,  but not  to bury  it.  I  think  that  is  really what we have seen over  this  period of time.  No  one  questions,  obviously,  the  right to petition, but I will also say to  the  Senator  from Wisconsin  that  never before  in my 20 years  in the  Senate have I seen such a campaign by  a group that has so distorted and mis represented the truth. I do think it is  legitimate and fair to point out to the  Senate that when these cards come in  they come in various types of big enve lopes. Unfortunately I cannot include  them in the REcoRD, but the fact is  they come packed in big bundles such  as  this, and they come  in envelopes  paid for by the banks.  This is a good deal different from  what I think most of us consider peti tioning  the Government, which  is  when the letters are sent by individual  citizens who are sufficiently concerned  about  the  issue  that  they  take  the  time to write it themselves, and to put  a stamp on it. I think it is important  that we characterize the nature of this  appeal to the Congress for what it is.  The Senator from Kansas and I have  tried  to point out  that  the claims  being made are a distortion and a mis representation.  Second we  have pointed out  the  nature and quality of  the petitions,  that we have received.  ",1983
144,Senate,98,-0.212,597,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I am  strongly committed to balanced budg ets. I am willing to make the tough  choices involved in cutting back Feder al spending.  Furthermore, I strongly support ex ecutive branch and legislative branch  reforms that can mean balanced budg ets for years into the future.  It is clear that the current system  actually encourages increased Govern ment spending and  increased  taxes.  is  the  time  to eliminate  those  biases and help Congress keep a lid on  spending and taxes.  I rise today, Mr. President, to intro duce a bill that will do this. This legis lation proposes what I believe is the  correct way to impose constructive re straint  on  the  burgeoning Federal  budget.  This bill uses two basic procedures  to accomplish the objective of impos ing constructive restraint on the FedThis  eral budget: First, no deficit spending  could be enacted unless both Houses  of Congress have agreed to it by three fifths votes. Second, each Member of  Congress would be required to vote for  or against any  tax  increase greater  than the percentage  increase  in the  gross national product-including the  tax increases brought on by inflation.  In essence, the measure will insure  that Congress decisively confronts pro posed  increases  in Federal  taxation  and Federal spending.  My bill would require the submission  of an alternate budget if the adminis tration's proposed budget contains a  deficit. The submission of an alternate  budget is critical, since it would permit  Congress quickly and directly to con sider and evaluate the option of adopt ing a balanced budget.  Later, during consideration of any  concurrent budget resolution or con ference report on such a .resolution, a  second requirement is applied. If the  percentage of proposed Federal reve nues compared to the estimated gross  national product exceeds the percent age for the previous year, a separate  vote must be taken on the question of  whether the increase should be accept ed.  In  this manner, Congress will be  forced to address an issue of concern  to the taxpayers and the voters of this  country-the growth of Federal spend ing beyond growth in the economy.  Finally,  if Congress decides  to ap prove a deficit budget,  it can do so  under my proposal. But, a three-fifths  majority vote of both Houses would be  required. I believe this extraordinary  majority requirement properly places  the presumption in favor of a balanced  budget. It would still be possible to use  deficit spending if economic exigencies  required it. However, the burden of es tablishing the need for a budget out of  balance would be placed on its advo cates-not its opponents.  I am under no illusion that this leg islation will  solve  all our economic  problems. It will not. But, it represents  an important first step.  Congress must address the public's  demand for restraint on Government  spending and appropriately balanced  budgets. The huge deficit projected  for the coming fiscal year will keep in terest rates high, choking off econom ic recovery and economic growth. The  prospect  of  continued  record-high  deficits is a frightening one.  Adoption of this bill and the subse quent reduction of deficits would send  a clear signal  to business  that Con gress is serious about regaining control  over Federal spending.  Interest rates are the key to whether  or not the economy will recover. Bal ancing  the budget will help  insure  that interest rates stay down.  Last year, for instance, farmers paid  $22  billion  in  interest  costs, while  earning only $20 billion. There will be  no economic recovery until this trend  changes. Interest rates have also hurt  farm exports, and crippled the hous ing and timber industries.  The first step toward. getting inter est rates  to a  reasonable  level  is  to  reduce the Federal deficit. This bill is  a good step toward making the long term reductions that are needed.e  By Mr. MATHIAS:  S. 1078.

145,Senate,98,-0.095,610,7,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President, as a  member of the advisory board of the  American University here in Washing ton, I consider it a privilege to be asso ciated with  its young and dynamic  president, Dr. Richard Berendzen.  Recently, while speaking before a  group of senior honor students, Dr.  Berendzen  reflected on  four  signifi cant lessons he learned while obtain ing his B.S. from Massachusetts Insti tute of Technology, and his M.A. and  Ph. D. from Harvard University. His  message to these young leaders of to morrow  is  timeless,  impressive,  and  thought provoking. It is a message not  only for our youth, but for us all-one  which can serve  to  remind us  that  through education we should obtain  the knowledge and wisdom to become  productive members of this society.  I am sure my colleagues will be in terested  in Dr. Berendzen's remarks  and I ask that they be printed in the  RECORD.  MAN OF THE YEAR FOR 1983: EDUCATED,  CARING PERSONS  <By Richard Berendzen)  Congratulations,  members  of Mortar  Board! By virture of being in this society,  you have demonstrated achievement at the  college  level.  Soon,  your  undergraduate  classes, papers, and exams will end. But in  these few words, I should like to return to  that education.  Before doing so, however, I wonder as you  read this if you know what time it is. Do  you know for certain what ""1983"" means?  You might say it is 1,983 years since the  birth of Christ. No, He was born about six  years before that. And He wasn't born on  December 25th or even on January 1st;  rather, he probably was born in the spring.  What precisely is a year? I am writing this  in January. Why does  January have 31  days? Isn't a month related to the moon?  Yet it takes the moon only 28 days to orbit  the earth, not 31. Why, by the way, are  there 12 months in a year? Wouldn't it be  more orderly to have a 10-month year, in a  decimal system? How can one month have  28 days and another 31? And what, exactly,  is a day? For that matter, what  is  time  itself? We make time, measure time,  take  time, spend  time, waste  time; we all  talk  comfortably about time, as if we know what  it is. But what, in fact, is time?  In short, are you-a senior honor stu dent-certain you actually know how to tell  time? And if you don't even know that, how  do you expect to succeed in life beyond col lege?  Almost everyone-whether student or ex perienced professional-take commonplace  things for granted.  LESSON NUMBER 1: You always have  more to learn. Wisdom comes not in what  you learn but in the realization of what you  have yet to learn.  As you may have guessed, my own profes sional field is astronomy. I'd now like to give  you a short riddle. Read it carefully.  ""What is the beginning of eternity,  The end of time and space;  The beginning of every end,  The end of every place?""  It is the letter e.  Lesson Number 2: Sometimes the answer  lies right before us, if only we could notice  and not be misled. The mark of the truly  educated person is not so much the ability  to penetrate the unknowable as it is to rec ognize and understand the knowable.  Now, let me give you an old proverb.  ""He who knows not and knows not that he  knows not, he is a fool. Shun him.  He who knows not and knows he knows  not, he is simple. Teach him.  He who knows and knows not he knows,  he is asleep. Wake him.  He who knows and knows he knows, he is  wise. Follow him.""  Lesson Number 3: Do not confuse words  for wisdom, pomposity for profundity. In  pretentiousness, this proverb awesomely re sembles modern rhetoric-from government  manuals to political speeches, from business  reports to scholarly tomes-except it is more  elegant and less pedantic than they often  are. At  least  it has no  ""points-in-time,""  ""interfaces,"" ""bottom  lines,""  ""prioritizes,""  or ""inputs.""  If you have things to say and genuinely  wish to say them, you can do so unequivo cally.  In this essay, I'd like to say some things  directly.  Sad to say, during much of your lifetime,  our nation-the nation I hold dear-has, by  many demonstrable measures declined.  By many measures, we have lost our re solve. We demand  little of ourselves and  accept  the  result. Our productivity slips.  Our work ethic plummets.  What is needed-not only in higher educa tion but in all of education, not only in edu cation but in all of American life-is a re dedication to a personal, institutional, and  even national sense of pride. When profes sions become only jobs, when mediocrity re places meritocracy, when today towers over  tomorrow,  then gradually,  inexorably,  the  foundation for self-respect deteriorates.  To assign blame and find solutions,  the  search need not go far. We collectively, have  lost confidence to demand excellence of our  nation and even of ourselves.  Schools alone can not teach rudiments of  civil living, respect for knowledge, apprecia tion of creatively, self-discipline-in short,  attributes that should be learned first in the  home.  In  today's rapidly evolving,  increasingly  complex world, many of our guiding social  institutions have diminished in significance.  Without doubt, one of the most poignant of  these declines has been in the role of the  family.  I  lament not a  changing  family  structure, but a weakening family responsi bility.  And, at the epicenter-more fundamental  than standards or work ethic, than pride or  even family-lies the singular concept that  home and family  teach best:  love.  In our  modern, chic world,  let us not fear to ac knowledge this basic human need.  You soon will not just graduate; you will  assume a  responsibility-literally,  to help  the nation be what it can be and should be.  To do so, however, you must be concerned  with more  than  just yourself.  In  recent  years,  the national economy has changed  many students' motivations. The humble  learner and  fledgling  scholar have given  way to the questioning consumer and future  job-seeker. And many students have come,  not for education but for certification. The  Wizard of Oz did not give the scarecrow a  brain; he gave what was perhaps more  useful-a diploma. Past satire has foreshad owed current reality.  In it most deliciously cynical form,  the  mandate of ""relevance  in education"" has  ",1983

150,House,98,0.46,688,7,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to join my distinguished and eloquent  and  compassionate  colleagues,  the  gentleman from Ohio and the gentle man  from Connecticut,  in  talking  about  this  rule and using  this rule  time to talk about what could become  the worst bill of this session.  I  rise, as did  the gentleman from  Ohio, to reluctantly support the rule,  but to point out to the House the need  for an open rule and the reason that  we are going to have to have extended  debate, as we should have had in the  past on  this bill. The amendments,  and I  found 14 of them filed  today  under this open rule, with amendment  after amendment, will point out con clusively to the Members of this House  and the American public the inherent  flaws of this bill.  Frankly, I am optimistic that at the  conclusion of debate, and whether the  debate ends today or sometime later, I  am optimistic that this House upon  reading the bill and realizing what this  legislation does to hurt people in this  country, that this House in a biparti san display of good sense will, in fact,  defeat  this  legislation. Even better,  this House should support and adopt  the Wylie amendment, which would  put into law the forbearance that the  regulatory agencies desperately need.  the gentleman from Connecticut  stated, that forbearance law could be  implemented and enacted today and  put into  the law by next week and  begin helping people immediately.  The open rule is needed. I count 14  amendments, 14 amendments that will  seek to try to clean up this bill if, in  fact, it can be cleaned up, 14 amend ments that will probably make some  As  improvements,  including  to  provide  that we use existing remedies under  existing law in chapter 13,  including  that we would use forbearance,  that  we would  just simply  target  this  to  those most in need and in unemploy ment; but the essential flaw of this  legislation cannot be cleaned up by  amendment. That  flaw  in  this bill  would  tell every financial  institution  in America that if you forbear, and  provide  partial  payments  and  give  homeowners a chance to get back on  their feet, then the financial institu tion would not get paid, but if this bill  passes and  the  financial  institution  does not forbear, but forecloses,  in stead,  the U.S. Government would  make those mortgage payments for 3  years and  the  institution would get  paid. In short, with the passage of this  bill, a financial institution would not  be paid if the institution forbears, but  would be paid if the institution fore closes. Thus would be created a cruel  irony, a powerful  incentive  to  fore close.  0 1420  If this bill passes the financial insti tution is  told all you have  to do  to  foreclose, all you have to do  to get  your money is to get paid and the Fed eral Government will pay the financial  institution that mortgage payment for  3 years, 36 months, no questions are  asked. But only for  the first 76,000  that would  foreclose,  and  I would  submit to my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle that you would see the  fastest, the largest, the most depress ing, and the cruelest stampede to fore closures  that  this Nation has  ever  seen.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983

152,House,98,-0.299,688,7,Mr. MINISH.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R. 1983, the Emergen cy Housing Assistance Act. This legis lation represents a plea on the part of  the American people; it is a plea for  Congress  to act decisively to protect  the most fundamental possession this  society  affords  its members,  their  home. This is an issue upon which this  body cannot afford to equivocate or be  hesitant. We must answer the cries of  Americans about to lose their homes  through foreclosure and vote to pass  this bill.  H.R. 1983 responds directly to condi tions which  are  the  result of  the  severe  economic  recession  that has  gripped  this country for  the past 2  years. To  qualify  for  assistance,  a  homeowner would  have  to  demon strate that the inability to make mort gage payments resulted from a sub stantial loss of income due to circum stances beyond their control. This bill  does not make assistance available to  households  where  irresponsibility  leads  to default on mortgage pay ments. Instead, it is reactive to an un employment  rate  which  currently  stands above 10 percent and a mort gage default rate which has risen to  2.36 percent.  Some Members are inclined to point  to statistics recently released by vari ous Government agencies which indi cate that our economic downturn may  be abating, and suggest that there is  no  longer a need for an emergency  mortgage relief program. While it is  certainly the hope of all of us in this  Chamber that this country will soon  experience a  time of economic pros perity, we should not lose sight of the  fact that recovery will be a slow proc ess and that the people who are losing  their mortgages need help now.  If this Congress is truly committed  to assisting homeowners to keep their  homes, we should show no reluctance  in authorizing  the appropriation of  the relatively modest sum of $760 mil lion necessary to establish the emer gency loan fund. By passing this bill,  this Congress would be giving a sign of  good faith to the American people. We  would  be  showing  them  that,  by  making 18-month emergency mortgage  ",1983

158,House,98,-0.422,714,7,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend  the able Member  from Texas <Mr.  GoNZALEZ) for sponsoring this legisla tion.  If you look out over this country,  and see how many homes have been  lost under  foreclosure,  people have  been taken away from the altars of  their family because of economic con ditions for which they are not respon sible, you can appreciate  the impor tance and the meaning of legislation  like this.  I think the record shows that under  the present economic conditions that  we have there are more mortgage fore closures than there have been at any  time since the Great Depression.  We have had more bankruptcies and  I  believe more  farm  foreclosures.  I  think this administration, and if we do  not do something about it, this Con gress is delinquent in not having given  greater assistance to the people of this  country against those conditions than  we have done so far.  And I base that upon the experience  that this country had in the New Deal  days. President Roosevelt was respon sible  for  the  establishment of  the  Home Owners Loan Corporation. And  I know, because I was in the Senate at  that  time,  that  that  organization  saved  thousands of homes  for  the  people of this country.  Maybe you have never had a home  sold  under  foreclosure, which  you  owned, where you had the family sen timents  so  embedded, but you can  imagine what it meant to all of those  people who have had  their homes  foreclosed away from them.  During  the New Deal  days,  the  Home Owners Loan Corporation not  only saved thousands of homes for the  people of this country but it made a  great profit upon what it did.  Only a few evenings ago I met Mr.  Brownstein, who was head of the FHA  in those days. I asked him how much  he thought the Home Owners Loan  Corporation netted in profit from its  operations during those days. He said,  ""I do not remember exactly but I be lieve it was somewhere in the neigh borhood of $200 million.""  I had lunch one day in the Senate  restaurant about the time the organi zation  terminated  its  activity. My  recollection is that the then head told  me it made a profit of $100 million. So,  we are not talking about waste, extrav agance,  throwing  the  peoples'  tax  money to the winds. We are talking  about saving the peoples' homes and  making  a  profit  in  the  operation.  Why? Because everybody knows that  America  is going  to come back, no  matter how deep the depression may  be.  I am one of the few in this Chamber  who lived through the depths of those  Depression days. I remember the time  when my law firm, which was a fairly  ",1983
159,,98,-0.418,818,7,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, there  has been a great deal of discussion  generated concerning  the  feasibility  and desirability of a space-based anti missile system as a result of President  Reagan's March 23 speech. One such  plan, which has gained wide attention,  is called High Frontier. It is my opin ion  that  this  concept  is  extremely  shortsighted and has many flaws. The  costs together with the many strategic  and  technical drawbacks make High  Frontier  impractical-and  an  idea  which should be soundly rejected.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I  submit in the REcoRD a brief-but con cise-critique of  the High Frontier  proposal which has been prepared by  the Center for Defense Information. It  is an excellent summary which de serves careful attention.  THE HIGH FRONTIER PROPOSAL: A CDI  CRITIQUE  The Center for Defense Information has  completed an analysis of the High Frontier  concept of space-based defense against bal listic missiles. The results of the study are  set forth in the following critique:  The High Frontier proposal for a Global  Ballistic Missile Defense <GBMD>  system  claims that it would < 1 > negate the Soviet  nuclear threat; (2) assure the survival of the  U.S. population; and (3) secure space for  commercial development.  The High Frontier project initially calls  for space-based missile defense and ground based point defense <a short-range defense  of missile  silos),  to be augmented by a  second tier or space-based defense <possibly  employing  laser weaponry),  an extensive  civil  defense program,  advanced manned  military space vehicles, and more.  The architect of High Frontier, Lt. Gener al Daniel Graham <USA-Ret.), former Direc tor of  the Defense  Intelligence Agency,  claims that the initial system can be de ployed using ""off  the shelf  technology"",  within 5-6 years, and at a ""reasonable cost""  of $40 billion.  These High Frontier claims are evaluated  as follows:  TECHNOLOGY  Technology for a space-based ballistic mis sile defense deployment does not exist. De spite decades of U.S. efforts, there are seri ous doubts that the simpler task of ground based  point  defense  of  ICBMs  can  be  achieved, especially against relatively cheap  and easy Soviet countermeasures. The High  Frontier's claims of existing ""off the shelf  technology"" have been debunked by Reagan  administration officials.

Be cause the award recognizes citizen in volvement by community residents, it  is also a direct reflection on the mayor  of Santa Ana, Gordon Bricken.  Having served as mayor of Santa  Ana since April 14, 1981, Mr. Bricken  is now stepping down from that post.  Gordon Bricken has been an out standing leader in contributing to the  general welfare and prosperity of the  city of Santa Ana, and has been a cen tral force in the growth of the commu nity. Mr. Bricken has been instrumen tal in creating a new image for the city  of Santa Ana through community ac tivities such as the Golden City Days,  the Community Christmas Tree and  Christmas Parade, and the Ambassa dor's Ball. He has also  encouraged  open communications between citizens  and local government through commu nity programs such as  the Mayor's  Roundtables and the Santa Ana To morrow Conferences.  During Mr. Bricken's term as mayor,  many projects came to fruition in the  city  of Santa Ana,  including  the  awarding of a cable  television  fran chise,  the opening of the Downtown  Parking Structure, the initial develop ment of Sasser Park, and the opening  of the Orange County World Trade  Center.  Gordon Bricken has taken part in  various programs that have had a ben eficial  impact on  the city of Santa  Ana. Mayor Bricken led the Orange  County delegation  to  the ""Invest in  America's Cities"" Conference in Hong  Kong and served on the board of direc tors of the Santa Ana Economic Devel opment Corp.  In addition,  as  chairman of  the  urban rail subcommittee of the U.S.  Conference of Mayors, Mr. Bricken  has supported local rail transportation  through active participation  in local  and national conferences.  In recognition of his distinguished  and  unselfish  contribution  toward  civic betterment,  it  is with pleasure  that I invite my colleagues to join me  in recognizing Gordon Bricken for his  dedicated work as mayor of Santa  Ana, Calif.

161,,98,-0.24,844,7,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Speaker, of all  the many pressing issues this Congress  will be addressing during the coming  months, some of the more crucial will  have to do with agriculture. With in creasing regularity, we are faced with  insurmountable  evidence  that  the  problems confronting U.S. agriculture  are structural. The amazing productiv ity of the American farmer has led to  mounting surpluses that threaten to  overwhelm the conventional sources of  demand for food, feed, and fiber, and  the search for balance is driven not  just by the desire to end the billions of  dollars of taxpayer outlays required to  pay for land idling and surplus com modity storage, but also to reduce the  growing pressures on the international  trading system.  Perhaps never before has the need  for farsighted changes in agricultural  policy  been  so  urgent. There  has  always been a great deal of discussion  about how new domestic outlets for  domestic agricultural production can  be  encouraged with a minimum of  Government  interference,  and  in  a  cost effective way, but  today,  those  new outlets are needed as part of a  structural reorientation of American  agriculture. The objective must be to  stimulate new value added processing  industries that will utilize U.S. agricul tural production in a way that benefits  consumers, producers, and  taxpayers  alike by providing demand for fuel and  chemical outlets,  in addition  to  the  conventional food, feed, and fiber.  A recent analysis of some of the per ceived changes in Soviet agricultural  policy since Yuri Andropov's rise  to  April 19, 1983  power  is worthy of consideration  in  this regard. In a recent Pro Farmer ar ticle, a highly regarded Soviet analyst  noted that changes  in Moscow's ap proach to agriculture point to a live stock policy emerging which counts on  domestically  grown  feeds,  possibly  supplemented by high protein concen trates as the best tor the maintenance  of these animals (emphasis added). To  some, this may appear to be yet a fur ther  exacerbation  of  our  current  export problems,  in which past cus tomers are moving further away from  consumption of excess U.S. produc tion. However,  this change  in policy  could  actually  afford  the United  States  an  opportunity  that  could  enable  us  to  contribute  toward  a  number of important national objec tives simultaneously. This opportunity  should not be lost.  As the following article printed in  last summer's Foreign Affairs maga zine points out, a U.S. fuel ethanol in dustry would provide our agricultural  policymakers with a new degree of  much-needed flexibility. By converting  the starch portion of U.S.-produced  corn and other grains  into  a  high  grade liquid fuel (ethanol), while still  preserving all of the original protein,  vitamins, and minerals, U.S. grain un dergoes  a  value-added process  that  meets both United States, and Soviet  (or any other trading partners') needs.  The  concentrated  <one-third  the  weight) high protein coproduct is an  excellent animal feeding material, and  its  transportation and storage  is far  more efficient than that of the bulk  grain. The United States benefits by  the production of a high grade liquid  fuel extender and octane enhancer, in creased economic  activity  and  jobs,  and improved trade flexibility, and the  Soviets and other U.S. customers bene fit from a concentrated feeding prod uct that more efficiently suits  their  needs.  Mr. Speaker, I commend this article  to my  colleagues' attention  as we  begin to focus on the crucial agricul tural policy questions in the weeks to  come.  The article follows:  MORE BANG FOR THE BUSHEL  To the EDIToR:  Karl-Eugen Wa.dekin's Spring 1982 look at  ""Soviet Agriculture's Dependence on  the  West"" was  a  thought-provoking  analysis  that should be required reading for U.S. ag ricultural policymakers of all stripes. While  it is certainly lamentable, there can be little  doubt  that American agriculture's profit ability under the current method of ""doing  business"" is heavily dependent upon sales to  Moscow.  In analyzing what to expect in the way of  Soviet grain purchases for the next five or  more years, Mr. Wadekin acknowledges that  Moscow will try very hard to cut down on  food imports and speculates that the Ameri can farmer will  find his market  reduced  thereby within a few years.

163,Senate,98,-0.329,883,7,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, the  Senate is going to vote on a delay of  withholding tax on interest and divi dends, and it is well and good, but the  vehicle is not any good and the House  of Representatives  is  not  seriously  thinking of doing anything on this rec iprocity bill before July 1. Maybe they  never will. The House of Representa tives  is  going  to want  to originate  whatever action is taken on this, and  we may wait a long time over here and  the people of this country may wait a  long time and find out that July 1 has  come and gone and this provision of  law is put into effect.  What  the people of  this country  would like our system of government  to do  is  for  the Senate  to pass an  amendment  to  either  stall off  the  withholding provision or repeal it and  the House of Representatives  to do  the same and vote on it and then the  President sign it.  All this talk about the President ve toing it is one thing. That is his pre rogative to veto it if he wants to. But  my concern  is  that the Senate act,  have  the chance  to vote on  it,  the  House of Representatives have  the  chance to vote on it and get to the  veto. We will also have a chance to  vote on the veto.  This vehicle today does not give us  that opportunity because  this  reci procity bill was not orginated in the  House of Representatives  itself and  the bill is in jeopardy. Because of the  nature of  the  reciprocity bill,  this  issue may never be voted on in the  House  of  Representatives  quickly  enough using this method.  I feel very strongly that we are going  to have to have another vehicle later  on if we ever hope to have a House  vote on it and then the President have  his chance to veto it if he wants, and  we will also have a chance to override  that veto.

164,Senate,98,0.257,987,7,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr.  President,  Congress  often  designates  special  weeks and months commemorating a  particular group or event. In addition  to providing an opportunity for na tional  recognition  of  such  groups,  these weeks  have  come,  in  recent  years, to be used as a way to focus at tention on a particular problem or dis ease. National Alzheimer's Disease  Week,  National  Physical  Fitness  Month, National Employ  the Older  Worker Week, all serve to awaken us  to the importance of these issues. This  month of April  is of special  impor tance because it has been deemed ""Na tional  Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month.""  According to the National Commit tee for the Prevention of Child Abuse,  the last 5 years have witnessed a 100percent increase in the number of re ported incidents of child abuse. Last  year alone, an estimated 1.1 million  children were in some way abused or  neglected. These figures become even  more staggering when one notes that  they are representative of only those  cases that are reported. And I  think  here is where the whole notion behind  prevention becomes critical. Although  it has been determined  that child  abuse cuts across all class lines and re ligious  and  cultural  backgrounds,  there remains a very deep fear of the  stigma attached to it. Experts also cite  a fear that the child will be perma nently taken away from the parents as  another reason why incidents go unre ported. What this also means, howev er,  is that neither the child nor the  parent  can  receive  the  assistance  needed to solve the problem.  A New York Times article addressing  this issue discussed the cases of several  parents who, under the strain of enor mous pressure, be it emotional, profes sional or  financial,  simply were no  longer able to deal patiently with the  average misbehavior of their children.  They recognized how close they were  to abusing their child. They also saw  the grave necessity of seeking some  outside help. These are not parents  who are alcoholics, or suffering from  some other disorder. These are aver age people who,  like you and I, are  faced with the problems of daily life  and have buckled under the enormous  stress that our lives are often charac terized by. Fortunately,  the persons  discussed in this article had a place to  tum.  In response to the growing incidents  of child abuse, nurseries and centers  equipped to keep children for a day or  two are springing up all-over the coun try. If a parent fears that they might  abuse, batter, or in some other way  harm their child,  they can take the  child to one of these centers where  they will be fed and can sleep until  some other course of action can be ar rived  at. Often,  the parent  simply  needs some time to get over what pre cipitated the crisis in the first place. If  the  problem  is more  deep  rooted,  social workers are recruited, or child  care  facilities  are  provided,  or  the  parent is enrolled in some sort of a re habilitation program designed  to ad dress whatever problem they may be  experiencing. What  is  important,  though, is that a possible incident can  be  averted. Programs  such  as  this  truly are preventative  in  that  they  offer immediate respite from a crisis  situation, and then provide the neces sary followup to insure that both the  child and the parent will be protected  from  the future possibility of child  abuse and the terrible suffering that  both experience as a result.  I extend my strongest support to the  development of  this  idea, and hope  that with this month and the atten tion and concern that will be directed  toward  this  tragic problem,  further  initiatives will emerge  that will ad dress child abuse  in a  realistic, con crete manner    THE REDIRECTION OF JOBS  BILL FUNDING   ",1983
165,Senate,98,-0.38,987,7,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President, on  April 7 the Department of Agriculture  announced at a hearing before the Ap propriations Committee's Subcommit tee on Agriculture, Rural Develop ment and Related Agencies that they  had unexpectedly run out of funds in  17 States to loan farmers for operating  capital  through  the Farmers Home  Administration.  Secretary Block, time after time, has  proudly stated that the Reagan ad ministration  has  significantly  in creased  the  level of operating  loan  funds extended by FmHA. What he  has not said, however,  is  that these  funding levels have been necessitated  by the disastrous economic situation  our  farmers have  faced. More and  more  farmers have had  their  local  bank turn them away, making FmHA  their only credit source.  Until April 7,  administration wit nesses have consistently testified that  they had sufficient funds to serve the  needs of qualified  farmers.  In fact,  even the first time the question of the  adequacy of funds was raised at the  hearing on April 7,  the administra tion's witness indicated that operating  loan funds remained and that those  funds might very well be sufficient to  last the fiscal year.  I raise this issue, Mr. President, for  two basic reasons. First, it is clear that  the Reagan administration has not  acted  in good  faith by keeping  the  Congress informed that operating loan  funds were in short supply. By the end  of the first week in March, notices had  been sent  to 10 States authorizing  them  to use funds  reserved for  the  third and fourth quarters of this fiscal  year to help offset the high demand  for loans. At that point, it should have  been obvious that a problem existed.  Was Congress notified? No.  In fact,  representatives  of  FmHA  testified  before the Appropriations Committee  in  the House  and  the Agriculture  Committees of both the House and the  Senate between early March and April  7,  but no mention was made  that  funds for operating loans were quickly  dwindling. Only when they had com pletely run out of money in 17 States  and were faced with a politically em barrassing problem did the Reagan ad ministration  admit  that  a  problem  even existed. This  inept  silence by  FmHA, combined with the unwilling ness of the Office of Management and  Budget to allow a supplemental to be  sent forward to the Congress created  the emergency situation we faced.  Mr. President, this brings me to the  second reason I have raised this issue  today. Last Friday, Secretary Block  announced that due to the extraordi nary emergency that existed, he would  utilize authority provided him in the  Department of Agriculture Organic  Act of 1944 (7 U.S.C. 2257) to transfer  funds from other programs to provide  an additional $400 million for operat ing  loans.  Instead  of  transferring  funds from the FmHA emergency loan  program, which has an unlimited ap propriation available to it, the Reagan  administration chose  to  redirect an  amount equal to one-half of the funds  the Congress recently provided in the  jobs bill for the rural water and waste  disposal  loan and grant programs funds specifically appropriated on an  emergency basis to create jobs in rural  America.  Currently, there is a backlog of over  $1 billion worth of water and waste  disposal project on hand, and millions  of Americans who are unemployed and  eager to return to work. To make the  specific decision to utilize these funds  when a perfectly legitimate and feasi ble  alternative  existed  clearly  indi cates the degree of callousness of this  administration  towards  the needs of  the unemployed and rural America.  The use of the interchange author ity granted by the Organic Act of 1944  in this manner, redirecting funds the  Congress had specifically appropriated  to meet an emergency need  just 1  month  ago,  raises  serious  question  whether  this  interchange  authority  should be  reviewed and further  re stricted.

173,House,98,-0.256,1039,7,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of legislation to pro tect  the health of our people,  the  purity of our environment, and the vi tality of our commerce and industry  from dangers posed by reckless dispos al of hazardous wastes.  I urge Congress to give prompt and  favorable  attention  to  two major  pieces of legislation of which I am a  cosponsor: H.R. 2478,  the Hazardous  Waste Control and Enforcement Act  of 1983,  introduced by Congressman  FLoRIO; and the Hazardous Substances  Response Act of 1983,  introduced by  Congressman RICHARDSON.  Together  these two measures would strengthen  Federal regulation of current hazard ous waste disposal, establish incentives  for  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes  through recycling and other alterna tive means, and expand State and Fed eral efforts to clean up existing haz ardous waste disposal sites.  Our Nation's productive capacity is  unequaled in the world. One byprod uct of this great capacity, however, is  an ever-increasing volume of hazard ous waste. Each year our Nation pro duces between 255  and 275 million  tons of wastes that are highly toxic to  humans.  For many years, those who generat ed hazardous wastes faced few State  or Federal restrictions on their right  to dispose of these wastes. As a result,  immense volumes of wastes have been  deposited in a careless and irresponsi ble manner allowing escape of wastes  into the land, water, and air. Tragedies  such as those that have befallen the  citizens of Niagara, N.Y., and Times  Beach, Mo., have finally focused the  attention of the American public on  this menacing and difficult problem.  My own State of South Carolina  faces serious problems in cleaning up  carelessly deposited hazardous wastes.  Three of the 418 sites that the Envi ronmental  Protection  Agency  has  identified as the Nation's most danger ous are in my State, and one of these  sites is in my district. Although clean up of these sites has made progress,  there have recently been discovered in  my State a large number of other sites  that pose potential hazards and that  will undoubtedly prove costly and dif ficult to clean. The State administra tive agency charged with responsibil ity for hazardous waste management  could efficiently use additional staff  and resources  to carry out a speedy  cleanup of these many sites. The legis lation  that  I  am  supporting  today  would provide such assistance.  Meanwhile hazardous wastes contin ue to accumulate in South Carolina at  a rapid rate. My State is a major re pository for hazardous wastes generat ed not only in South Carolina but in  other States as well. In fact, almost  half of the hazardous wastes placed  each year in landfills in South Caroli na is generated outside the State. One  of the major sites for such disposal is  in Sumter County, in my district. We  must take steps to insure that hazard ous wastes deposited on such sites are  safely and adequately contained.  A major new hazardous waste dis posal facility was also proposed for a  site just across the State border from  my district, in Anson County, N.C. An  environmental study showed that the  composition of the soil and the high  watertable underlying this site made it  unsuited  for  containing  hazardous  waste. Many of my constituents were  justifiably concerned that if a hazard ous waste facility were placed on this  site, hazardous wastes would seep into  groundwater near the site and pollute  a  tributary of  the Pee Dee River,  which provides a principal source of  water for drinking, agriculture, and in dustry. The  fact  that  this  landfill  could potentially have affected  resi dents in more than one State, and that  it possibly could have qualified for a  permit under current Federal regula tions, illustrates the need for more rig orous waste disposal  laws applicable  thoughout the country.  The legislation that I urge Congress  to adopt would  take major steps  to  prevent continued careless disposal of  hazardous wastes and to clean up al ready existing hazardous waste dispos al sites.  The Resource Conservation and Re covery Act of 1976 <RCRA> establishes  the legal framework for EPA's current  regulation of hazardous wastes. It is  now generally recognized that RCRA  fails to mandate sufficiently rigorous  regulation of hazardous wastes. The  regulations  that EPA has  issued  to  date under RCRA  exempt  far  too  many hazardous wastes and hazardous  waste facilities, and they set perform ance standards that in many cases are  too lax. H.R. 2478 remedies these defi ciencies in RCRA.  H.R. 2478 adopts the general policy  that reliance on land disposal facilities  should be minimized because landfills  cannot insure perpetual containment  of hazardous wastes. The bill, howev er, takes a realistic and balanced ap proach to the issue of landfills by im plicitly assuming that, under rigorous  safeguards, landfill disposal of certain  substances must be allowed to contin ue for some time, until suitable alter native  technologies become available  for widespread use.  To reduce the risks of landfill use  during this interim period, H.R. 2478  would prohibit  the  land disposal of  certain of the most dangerous wastes,  including,  in certain concentrations,  cyanide, PCB's, arsenic, and cadmium.  It would authorize EPA  to prohibit  land disposal of many other wastes,  and  it specifically  lists dioxins as a  hazardous substance subject to EPA  regulation. It also prohibits the under ground injection of hazardous wastes  near sources of drinking water, and it  restricts the landfill disposal of liquid  wastes.  I believe that States can make a val uable contribution to hazardous waste  management. Many States  regulate  hazardous wastes that totally escape  Federal  regulation, and some States  have developed farsighted waste man agement programs that now serve as  models for Federal action. The Reagan  administration, however, has drastical ly  reduced  the  amount of  funding  available under RCRA for State haz ardous waste programs.  To strengthen  the  role of States,  H.R. 2478 would authorize increases in  Federal assistance to States for devel opment and implementation of State  hazardous waste programs. It would  also authorize EPA to make grants to  local governments to construct demon stration recycling centers for hazard ous wastes. South Carolina, which has  already  gained  considerable  experi ence with  hazardous waste,  could  make effective use of such assistance.  To protect public safety, H.R. 2478  sets deadlines by which all  landfills  and other hazardous waste facilities  must  either  receive  permits or be  closed. This will insure that landfills  and other facilities currently operat ing under EPA permits will not stay in  business  indefinitely  unless  they  comply with the bill's new permitting  standards.  H.R. 2478 would exempt from regu lation only  those who generate  less  than one-tenth of a ton of hazardous  waste each month. The bill would also  authorize EPA to apply more stringent  regulatory  standards  to  those who  each month generate less than 1 ton  of hazardous waste than to those who  generate more than 1 ton. This flexi ble approach  takes account both of  the need to regulate disposal of the  considerable volumes of wastes gener ated by some small businesses, and the  relatively heavy cost that enforcement  of  the most  stringent  regulations  could impose on such businesses.  Finally, H.R. 2478 strengthens the  remedies available to citizens, States,  municipalities, and the EPA to enforce  hazardous waste laws and regulations;  it reenfores the authority of criminal  investigators; and it increases criminal  penalties for certain classes of hazard ous waste offenses.  H.R. 2478 would take major steps to  prevent recurrence of the type of haz ardous waste disasters  that have af fected many of our people in recent  years. Such prevention of hazardous  waste problems will  prove  far  less  costly  than  cleaning  up  hazardous  waste sites created through irresponsi ble forms of disposal.

174,,98,0.43,1052,7,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Speaker, from  1959  to 1975 millions of Americans  served their country proudly in Viet nam. Over 57,000 never returned. For  the veterans who came home and the  families of  those who did not, 1982  marked the end of a long silence, when  their country finally turned to them  and reverently saluted their sacrifice.  With the dedication of the Vietnam  Memorial on November 13, 1982, the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Nation  rose above  the  internal con flicts the war evoked in order to recog nize and to honor  those who served  their  country. Since  its dedication,  over 1 million people have come to the  monument to pay tribute to the Viet nam veterans and to rekindle memo ries of lost family and friends.  Helene Monberg, a veteran Washing ton news correspondent, recently ac companied a  family  from Leadville,  Colo., who  came  to Washington  to  visit the memorial and see the name of  their lost loved one engraved in the  polished stone,  to stand among  the  long, solemn granite walls which seem  to state, ""that you gave your lives or  that you gave your youth will always  be remembered.""  I ask permission to have inserted in  the record Mrs. Monberg's eloquent  portrayal of  their experience, which  directly or indirectly is shared by all  of us.  [From the Herald Democrat, Leadville,  Colo., Mar. 11, 19831  MARINE SERGEANT KASTRINOS  WASHINGTON.-Four  residents  of  the  Washington, D.C. area went on a pilgrimage  on Feb. 19 to seek out the name of an Amer ican Hero, Marine Sergeant Jerold (Jerry>  Kastrinos of Leadville.  They were Helene C. Monberg, veteran  news correspondent and a Leadville native  distantly related to the young sergeant by  marriage; her grandniece Jessica Hately, 11,  of McLean, Va.; Mrs. Barbara Evans and her  son Johnny Neitzey, 8, both of Alexandria,  Va.  Their destination was new Memorial  to  the men and women who died in the Viet nam conflict. Jerry Kastrinos left a young  wife and  two small children  to serve his  country in Vietnam, where he was killed in  December, 1967. He also left two grieving  parents, Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kastrinos of  Leadville.  The Washington area was a mess  that  day. A snowstorm had blanketed the Wash ington area on Feb 11 and people were still  digging out. The area around the memorial  was knee-deep in mud. The memorial, pol ished black granite, contains the names of  the 58,000 Americans killed in the Vietnam  conflict, but it looked that day like the end  of a beat-up football field.   Still the people came, hundreds of them  on the first nice weekend day since the Big  Snow. Our group chose  the day because  Mrs. Evans and her son Johnny will soon be  -going overseas  to  join her new husband,  Major Mitchell Evans, in Germany, where  Johnny is looking forward to playing soccer  with the natives.  Jessica, a native of Colorado Springs who  recently moved  to  the Washington area  from Dallas, has been sightseeing, and she  knew where  the Memorial was  located,  hidden between the big memorials to Wash ington  and  Lincoln,  on Washington's  famous Mall.  Once on the site, the 70 slabs of granite  are  intimidating. But  there  is a  friendly  woman on  the site with a  list of nearly  58,000 names of men and women killed in  the Vietnam conflict. She let the group take  a picture of her, with Jessica and Johnny.  Then she found Jerry's name: Jerold Lloyd  Kastrinos, Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, of  Leadville, Colo., on panel No.  31. They  walked over to the panel, which is on the  April 20, 1983  right side of the V-shaped memorial, and  there, about the middle of the panel, was  Jerry's name. It gave one a catch in his  throat. Jerry's name finally honored after  all  of  these  years  of  torment  for  his  family ....  Everyone  took pictures of everyone else  pointing to Jerry's name. It came out quite  clearly  in a couple of  the pictures, even  though the names aren't that large on the  panels. A tiny American flag was placed by  panel 31E. The group took a picture of that  too, and of the large crowd slowly moving in  and around the memorial, many bent on  finding a name just as the four had. Most  walked to the east, enroute to the Washing ton Monument, and at the end of the Viet nam Memorial there was a veteran passing  the American POW I  out literature about  MIA's on which there has been no word to  relatives and friends for many years. They  are potential prisoners of war and missing in  action  servicemen who have never been  heard from even though the Vietnam con flict ended on April 30, 1975. Everyone took  a pamphlet from the veteran from the Vet erans' Vigil Society.

176,,98,-0.429,1078,7,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing today with 30 Members of  the New York State  delegation  a  House  joint  resolution which  com memorates the centennial of the open ing of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The resolution calls upon the Presi dent to designate the day of the anni versary, May 24, 1983, as ""Brooklyn  Bridge Day,"" asks the Speaker to ap point  a  congressional delegation  to  attend the celebrations of this imporApril 20, 1983  tant anniversary which are planned in  New York, and requests that enrolled  copies of the resolution be transmitted  to New York's Governor Cuomo,  to  the mayor of the city of New York and our former colleague-Ed Koch,  and  to Brooklyn Borough President  Howard Golden.  The Brooklyn Bridge enjoys a spe cial place in our national history,  in  the archives of architectural achieve ment, and in many of the noted cul tural efforts of our time. When the  bridge opened 100 years ago, it was the  longest suspension bridge in the world.  The cost of $15 million was a signifi cant  investment and was shared by  New York State, New York City, and  by Brooklyn, which then was a sepa rate governmental entity. The bridge  took 13 years to complete.  The  lives of construction workers  were constantly at risk. Huge cham bers called caissons were lowered into  the water. Men worked below the sur face with little air, etching the huge  pilings on which the bridge stands into  the rock below  the surface. At one  point, a fire broke out in an underwa ter chamber. This,  and other acci dents,  resulted  in  the deaths of at  least 20 construction workers.  The project was conceived by John  A. Roebling, who pressed for a  link  over the East River between the cities  of New York and Brooklyn; Washing ton  Roebling,  who  succeeded  his  father  as  chief  engineer 6 months  after  the project began, and Emily  Roebling,  the wife of the chief engi neer, who  carried on many of his  duties once Washington was disabled  after working on a caisson during the  construction process. The Brooklyn  Bridge Centennial Commission stated  recently, ""Emily Roebling assumed an  unparalleled position for a  late 19th  century woman, becoming the link be tween her husband and  the outside  world.""  To mark the opening, on May 24,  1983, Montgomery Schuyler wrote the  following words in Harper's Weekly:  It so happens  that  the work which  likely  to be our most durable monument,  and to convey some knowledge of us to the  most remote posterity, is a work of bare util ity; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace,  but a bridge.  is  Arthur Miller has written about this  magnificent national  treasure  in ""A  View From the Bridge.""

177,,98,-0.351,1091,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. Speaker, during  the last several years, many Members  of the House have come increasingly  concerned  over  the  soaring  price  Americans pay for natural gas. This  concern  has  been  heightened  by  recent stories in local newspapers of  people  freezing  to death because of  their  inability  to pay  their heating  bills.  While natural gas prices are skyrock eting around the Nation, the situation  in Iowa has become critical. Within  the last 6 months, two of the major  natural gas pipelines which  supply  Iowa with 90 percent of its gas, have  raised their gas prices nearly 20 per cent,  costing  Iowans  an  additional  $791 million for the natural gas they  use. In fact, the average household is  expected to pay about $725 for natural  gas this year. This is double the figure  Iowans paid in 1979, even when energy  conservations is figured in.  The impact on the local economy is  also severe. For example, officials have  calculated  that  the 835 natural gas  users  in Gutherie Center, Iowa (735  residences and 100 commercial users),  will  pay  approximately  32  percent  more for natural gas during 1983 than  . what they paid in 1982. And that as sumes there will be no more rate in crease  requests added  to  those  that  are  now  pending. With  just  1,713  people, Gutherie Center could lose an  estimated $171,000 from its local econ omy-a hundred dollars for every man,  woman, and child in the town.  Farmers, already  facing  the worst  economic slump since the depression,  are also hit hard. Although they do  not usually heat their homes with nat ural gas,  they do use propane,  two thirds of which comes from natural  gas.  In addition,  Iowa's farmers use  natural gas, directly or indirectly, for  fertilizer and to dry their crops. Since  passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act  of 1978 <NGPA>-legislation which I  opposed-fertilizer  costs  have  risen  more than any other farm cost, except  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  raw  fuels  and  short-term  interest  rates. Farm income, which dropped 19  percent in 1982, threatens to fall an other 16 percent this year, especially if  Congress fails  to reduce the upward  pressure on natural gas prices.  Despite all this, the Reagan adminis tration and some members of the oil  and natural gas industry want to accel erate decontrol of natural gas. The  President's decontrol measure would  modify current law and lift price con trols on gas discovered prior to 1977,  old gas. It has been estimated that the  President's proposal will cause residen tial gas bills nationwide to soar 67 per cent by 1986 and cost Americans an  additional $50 billion  in natural gas  costs. Such decontrol would also cost  an average Des Moines area household  that heats with natural gas nearly  $560 in higher gas bills over the next 4  years.  The people of Iowa-along with mil lions  of  other Americans-deserve  better. They deserve  to be protected  from price gouging companies who do  not care about the consumer. For this  reason I have  joined 93 Members of  the House in cosponsoring H.R. 2154,  the Natural Gas Consumer Relief Act  of 1983. This bill tackles the shortcom ings of the NGPA head on. The bill:  Rolls back costs to what they were  in January 1982.  Extends for another 2 years controls  on 60 percent of the natural gas now  scheduled for decontrol in 1985 under  theNGPA.  Provides  strict  limits on  the con tracts pipeline  companies  can  sign.  Contract  proviSions  which  require  pipelines to pay the highest price of  any other contract  in a  given geo graphic area and other abusive provi sions would be  illegal. The pipeline  companies would be  required  to  re negotiate  their  present  high-priced  contracts  that violate  the  law,  and  they would be required  to purchase  the cheapest gas available.  Requires the Federal Energy Regu latory Commission <FERC) to limit a  pipeline's passthrough of gas costs to  the extent the pipeline has failed to  adopt and follow practices which mini mize its gas costs. This is an important  provision since FERC now allows pipe lines to pass almost any costs, whether  prudently  or  imprudently  incurred,  along to consumers.  Prohibit FERC from administrative ly raising gas prices. Through adminis trative action, FERC has allowed gas  producers to charge an extra amount  for production costs associated with  producing natural  gas. Historically,  these costs have been included in the  ceiling price. But, by regulation, FERC  has decided that price ceilings should  no longer include these costs. The net  result is a $10 billion increase in natu ral gas bills over the next 4 years. The  FERC has also administratively ex panded the definition of certain cate9331  gories of higher-priced gas. Under the  bill I have cosponsored,  the decision  on production costs would be reversed,  and  the Commission would  lose  its  ability to boost gas prices higher.  The Natural Gas Consumer Relief  Act, if passed by Congress, will lower  natural gas prices. For example,  the  average Des Moines-area household  will save $780 over the next 4 years  compared to current law, rather than  paying the $560 more under the Presi dent's decontrol plan.  The Natural Gas Consumer Relief  Act of 1983 offers a sound approach  for bringing about  lower prices  for  natural gas. The bill will correct the  serious deficiencies of the Natural Gas  Policy Act and will help restore fair ness and equity  to  the natural gas  market.  I  strongly support  this  legislation  and hope Congress will act soon in en acting this measure.e  CONSUMERS PAY FOR GAS  DECONTROL  HON.

178,,98,-0.334,1091,7,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to share with my colleagues an on  ed piece on natural gas from the April  18, 1983, edition of the Philadelphia  Inquirer.  This well  reasoned  and  timely  article was written  by Mr.  Randy Canale, chairman of the Penn sylvania Public Interest Energy Com mittee and president of the Delaware  County AFL-CIO Council.  I whole heartedly support this position.  The article follows:  CONSUMERS PAY FOR GAS DECONTROL  <By Randy Canale>  Just about everyone agrees that soaring  natural gas prices are a big problem. Not  only consumers who heat with gas, but  farmers, small businesses, major industries  and even gas ultilities and pipelines are  bearing the burden of gas costs that have  doubled since 1978. That is when Congress  passed the Natural Gas Policy Act <NGPA>  to phase out the controls that held down  well-head gas prices.  Even  the oil companies, which produce  most of  the nation's natural  gas,  have  changed their tune. Abandoning their old  complaint that gas prices are kept artificial ly low by federal regulation, the oil compa nies now are trying to convince us that the  remaining price controls are keeping gas  prices too high.  Just as oil prices fell after oil was decon trolled, they say, so would natural gas prices  fall in a totally decontrolled ""free market.""  In their view, the phased decontrol of the  NGPA is not enough-more gas must be de controlled faster.  It's a strange and wondrous argument the  oil  companies make. Why  the  sudden  change in rhetoric? Were they simply mis taken before, when they told us that con trols kept prices too low? And if decontrol  ",1983
179,House,98,-0.391,1130,7,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Chairman, as  a cosponsor of House Joint Resolution  13, I rise to strongly urge its passage.  A nuclear weapons freeze  is a vital  first step in reversing the insane and  wasteful  arms  race.  I  also  rise  to  strongly  oppose  the many  amend ments which have been offered  to  House Joint Resolution 13  to cripple  its  intent. While  these amendments  have the appearance of calling for re ductions in our nuclear arsenals, they  are only masquerades for the continu ation of the arms race at astronomical  levels.  The fact is that the United States  and the Soviet Union have far exceed ed the nuclear firepower necessary to  deter each other from launching a nu clear attack. The Soviets clearly know  that a first strike on the United States  would be  followed by  retaliation so  devastating that the U.S.S.R. would be  returned to the stone-age; indeed, in a  recent article for foreign policy, Leon  Sigal, guest scholar at the Brookings  Institute noted:  One Trident  submarine  alone  carries  enough nuclear warheads  to destroy 192  Soviet cities or targets of comparable value.  Three of the most modem class of Soviet  submarines have equivalent value. This reci procity  satisfies  the  requirement  in U.S.  strategic doctrine  for mutual assured de struction.  Opponents of the nuclear freeze say  that it will undermine President Rea gan's arms control efforts. The fact is  that those efforts are ephemeral.  The President has called  for  the  United States to create the ability to  fight a ""prolongd nuclear war"" in his  defense guidance. The administration  is planning a massive $1.6 trillion ex penditure over the next 5 years on nu clear weapons. It plans to build 17,000  nuclear warheads, new seaand land based missiles, cruise missiles, nuclear  submarines  and  strategic  bombers,  space weapons and chemical and bio logical weapons. The administration  has refused to push for the ratifica tion of SALT II, abandoned negotia tions  for a  comprehensive  test ban  <CTB> treaty, sought major changes in  the peaceful nuclear explosions <PNE)  treaty  and  the  threshold  test ban  <TTB) treaty, and proposed abrogation  of  the  treaty  limiting  spaced-based  weaponry. It has proposed $4.5 million  for civil defense,  including  the  ludi crous plans for delivering mail after a  nuclear holocaust. President Reagan  appointed Kenneth Adelman-whose  disdain for arms control is exceeded  only by his ignorance of disarmament  issues-to head the Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency.  The President most  recently  un veiled plans for a  large research and  development program for an antibal listic missile system-which may  re quire abrogating the antiballistic mis sile treaty, one of the most important  arms control agreements between the  United States and the Soviet Union to  date. This proposal would certainly set  off a new round in the arms race, as  each side attempts to develop counter measures to the other side's defenses.  Those countermeasures will likely in clude an accelerated stockpile of war heads to saturate the defenses of the  other side.  All of these policies would ironically  decrease our security despite this mul tibillion-dollar cost. They would fuel  the arms race, heighten tensions with  the Soviets, and waste precious  re sources that could be used to increase  our national  security by enhancing  our  economic,  social,  and  political  structures.  Millions of Americans have rejected  the administration's abandonment of  arms control and joined the grassroots  nuclear freeze movement. The resolu tion we are considering today is an ex pression of this widespread public sup port for arms control and has as its  prime objective pressuring the Presi dent to pursue realistic arms and arms  control policies.  The resolution calls on the United  States and U.S.S.R.  to negotiate  a  mutual and verifiable  freeze  in the  testing, production, and. deployment of  nuclear weapons. Such an agreement  would halt the senseless expansion of  Soviet  as well  as U.S.  arsenals.  It  would  directly  benefit  the United  States by freezing Soviet moderniza tion of warhead technologies. The res olution places priority on agreements  eliminating  the most  destabilizing  weapons, particularly those with high  accuracy, multiple warheads, large ex plosive power and short flight  time.  Such weapons have the appearance-if  not  the  actual  capability-of  first strike capability and could force  the  United States and U.S.S.R.  to adopt  launch-on-warning policies, greatly in creasing the chance of accidental nu clear war.  The resolution calls for agreements  to freeze the growth of nuclear arse nals to be followed by substantial and  equitable  reductions. The  resolution  also emphasizes that any arms control  agreement hinges on adequate guaran tees of verification and compliance.  In addition  to  increasing our mili tary security and stability, a  freeze  would greatly enhance our economic  security by saving an estimated $90  billion over the next 5 years.  It is long past time we defined na tional security  in terms beyond new  weapons systems. National security re quires educated children and trained  workers. It requires a strong healthy  industrial base and expanded scientific  research and development. It requires  a healthy, productive population. If  we neglect our children, our jobs, our  industry, our health care,  then no  amount of weapons will save us.  House Joint Resolution 13 is one of  the most vital measures we will deal  with in this Congress. I urge my col leagues to support it and join millions  of Americans in rejecting the insanity  of the nuclear arms race.e  e ",1983
180,House,98,0.375,1130,7,Mr. COATS.," Mr. Chairman, one of  the traps into which many of us have  fallen is this: we hold on to an idea or  a position even after a better idea has  come along to replace it.  We are certainly all concerned about  the arms race, about the spread of nu clear weapons. And we are all search ing for a means to reduce the threat  posed by  the  continued production  and deployment of nuclear weapons.  The nuclear freeze proposal has had  a great deal of popular support, not  because it is necessarily the best idea  or the only solution to the problem,  but because it has served to focus our  attention on a critical issue. In this re spect, the freeze has been important  to the nuclear arms debate. It has got  us thinking and talking about an issue  which affects our lives and the lives of  our children.  As a result of this debate, new ideas  and proposals have emerged. Many  have asked the question: Why cannot  we do better than a freeze? Instead of  accepting  the status quo, why not  demand real reductions in our nuclear  arsenals?  ",1983
181,House,98,-0.384,1143,7,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, the first gathering of American  survivors  of  the  Nazi  Holocaust  against  the Jews was held here  in  Washington. The suffering that was  inflicted on  those survivors, and on  the millions of European Jews who did  not survive, can,  in  some sense, be  traced to the Turkish massacre of the  Armenians that we recall today. For  Adolf Hitler, in justifying his ""Final  Solution,""  is  reported  to have said,  ""Who today remembers the massacre  of the Armenians?""  In observing Armenian Martyrs Day,  we seek to insure that the massacre of  more than 1% million Armenians will  not be forgotten. There are those who  seek to deny the historical fact of the  Armenian genocide. Their attempts to  revise history to erase the atrocities  that were committed against the Ar menians, must be overcome.  Only by keeping the memory of past  horrors fresh can we maintain our vig ilance against the possibility of future  genocides. The establishment of the  Holocaust Memorial as part of  the  Smithsonian Museum will  serve  to  educate current and  future genera tions of Americans on the massacre of  the Armenians as well as  the Holo caust  against  the  Jews,  and  help  insure  that  the United States will  always  stand  as  a  bulwark against  genocide.  One action that should be taken in  demonstrating  our  commitment  to  human rights and our understanding  of the lessons of the genocides of the  20th century is the ratification of the  Genocide Convention. For 34 years the  convention has been before the com munity of nations. In that time, some  88 nations have ratified it,  including  every othe major industrial power. Yet  the United States, despite our role as a  leading force for human rights, still  has not ratified.  I have introduced House Resolution  50, which expresses the sense of the  House that the United States should  ratify  the Genocide Convention. Ar menian Martyrs Day, and Holocaust  Memorial ceremonies, provide power ful reminders of the horrors of the  past. The Genocide Convention is the  tool we need to prevent future recur rences of those horrors. On this day, I  urge my colleagues to join me in call ing for U.S. ratification of this vital  international treaty.e   ",1983
182,House,98,0.122,1143,7,Mrs. JOHNSON.," Mr. Speaker, as a  part of the order to commemorate the  Armenian genocide, sponsored by my  respected  collegue  from California,  CHARLES  PASHAYAN,  I would  like  to  read the following quote:  I have issued the command-and I'll have  anybody who writes but one word of criti cism executed by a firing squad-that our  war aim does not consist in reaching certain  lines, but in the physical destruction of the  enemy. Accordingly,  have  placed my  death-head formations in readiness-for the  present only  in the East-with orders  to  them to send to death mercilessly and with out compassion, men, women and children  of Polish derivation  and  language. Only  thus shall we gain the living space which we  need. Who, after all, speaks today of the an nihilation of the Armenians? 1  I  Mr. Speaker, Adolf Hitler said that  on August 22, 1939, in a speech to su preme commanders and commanding  generals of his army, in the town of  Obersalzberg.  Mr. Speaker, who  indeed does  re member the annihilation of the Arme nians? Yet 68 years ago a million and a  half Armenians were massacred by the  Turkish Government  lead by Talat  Pasha, as part of a premeditated and  organized plan of genocide  that the  Turkish Government  of  today not  only refuses to acknowledge as histori cal fact, but also actively distributes  misinformation about an attempt  to  distort the historical record.  The  full horror of  the massacres  began on the night of April 24, 1915,  when the Turkish police rounded up  all of the Armenian intellectuals from  their homes in Constantinople, effec tively silencing the voice of a genera tion. In the villages, Turkish soldiers  gathered the unarmed Armenian men  into the village square <the Govern ment had already confiscated all weap ons), executed them, and then deport ed the women and children into the  vast Syrian desert. There were  few  survivors.  Today we commemorate a day of  mourning, not only for those who died  in the Armenian genocide, but for all  mankind. The criminals in this crime  of  genocide  are  not  the Turkish  people, but national chauvinism, prej udice  and  fear,  and  the  ultimate  enemy is silence. The genocide itself is  an eternal reminder to all mankind of  the moral obligation we bear to speak  out against persecution, and to main tain a constant vigil for the preserva tion of human rights. If we  fail  in  these obligations, we may well use as  our epitaph these words from George  'Louis Paul, Lochner, What About Germany?,  <New York: Dodd, Mead and Cornwall), 1942.  ",1983
183,House,98,0.013,1156,7,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  my Subcommittee on Housing and Me morial Affairs began hearings on the  VA housing program. One of the bills  being considered is H.R. 2618 which I  introduced on Tuesday.  This  bill would  provide  financial  relief  to unemployed veteran home owners facing foreclosure. If a veteran,  through no fault of his own, is at least  6 months delinquent in his mortgage  payments, the VA would be authorized  to set up an escrow account  in his  behalf to make him current and pro vide up  to 6 months of additional  relief. This assistance could be  ex tended, if necessary, but in no event  could  the  total monetary  advance  exceed $8,400.  This measure  is specifically geared  to those needy veterans who are suf fering from the effects of unemploy ment, underemployment or serious ill ness. Recent statistics  indicate  that  800,000 Vietnam and disabled veterans  are unemployed.  Mr. Speaker, I feel this is important  legislation  for  us  to  consider. The  economy appears to be on the upswing  but there are many veterans who con tinue to be unemployed. The chances  are good, however, that they will be  able to get back on their feet shortly.  Meanwhile,  foreclosures are at an  alltime high. We must do something  to help our veterans during this inter im period of economic adversity. As  you know,  the House Banking, Fi nance and Urban Affairs Committee  has reported legislation which would  establish  a  new  revolving  fund  to  assist homeowners facing foreclosure  on home mortgage loans not insured  by  the Federal Housing Administra tion or the Farmers Home Administra tion. Although  this measure would  help some veterans, we believe our bill  provides an alternative remedy.  It should be noted that our bill re quires no new money from taxpayers  to provide  this assistance. This program would be funded out of existing  revolving funds currently used to pay  claims.  It  is  possible  that  this bill  could even prove cost effective by sub stituting  this mortgate payment ad vance for the high expenses currently  incurred by the Veterans' Administra tion in paying claims of lenders, insti tuting foreclosure procedures and re selling acquired properties.  I am pleased to say that my bill is  cosponsored by the chairman of the  full committee,  the gentleman from  Mississippi, Mr. SONNY MONTGOMERY;  the ranking minority member of the  subcommittee,  Mr.  CHRISTOPHER  SMITH of New Jersey; Mr. BoB EDGAR  of  Pennsylvania,  the  distinguished  chairman  of  our Subcommittee on  Hnspitals and Health Care and a gen tleman who is known for championing  the cause of all veterans; Mr. LANE  EvANS of Illinois, a Vietnam veteran  and  outstanding member;  and Mr.  BILL RICHARDSON of New Mexico, a dis tinguished member of the subcommit tee who is vitally interested in assist ing veterans in need, especially those  who served in Vietnam.

185,,98,-0.514,1312,7,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  today  marks  the 75th anniversary of  the  New York County Lawyers Associa tion. For 75  years,  the New York  County Lawyers Association <NYCLA)  has served the bar, the bench, and the  public in an effort to insure that our  legal  system works  effectively. The  work that its lawyers have done can  only serve to act as a model for many  throughout the Nation.  On this day, 75 years ago, 143 ""attor neys or counselors of  the Supreme  Court of New York State  in active  practice, residing or having our office  in New York County"" officially incor porated the New York County Law yer's Association. This year, NYCLA's  Diamond Jubilee Year,  the original  143 lawyers of the association have in creased to over 10,000.  Since its founding in 1908, NYCLA  has devoted itself to serving the com munity. This commitment to service is  exemplified by the practical legal edu cation <PLE) series, the work of scores  of committees, and the dedication of  the library and administrative staffs  to the ideals of the New York County  Lawyers Association.  The center of these activities is the  ""Home of Law,"" NYCLA's landmarked  building at 14 Vesey Street, with its  nobly proportioned auditorium mod eled after Independence Hall in Phila delphia. There, and  in  the various  meeting rooms, members gather regu larly to do the work of the commit tees, to be enriched by PLE courses,  luncheon forums, panel discussions at  forum evenings and special symposia.  Social  pleasures  include  these  and  other events such as the Annual Re ception for the Judiciary, and gather ings in honor of distinguished Ameri cans and foreign visitors.  The New York County Lawyers' As sociation, one of  the  largest county  bar associations in the United States,  has long held a leadership position in  New York City,  legal capital of  the  world. Membership  is  drawn  from  every section of the profession: The  judiciary and court staffs, elected and  appointed government officials,  law yers from the largest law firms, and  single practitioners and newly admit ted attorneys.  NYCLA  is  proud  to  have  been  among the first bar associations in the  country to sweep away all race, sex,  and color barriers to membership, and  to have been one of the earliest bar as sociation authorities on professional  ethics.  From its inception, NYCLA has rec ognized a  responsibility  to serve the  profession and the public generally not only major firms but also  those  with more modest practices and public  interest groups-so that cost effective  legal services, determined by ability to  pay, may be made available  to  the  public.  virtually no aspect of legal practice,  domestic or foreign, is unrepresented.  Committee  reports  frequently  lead  to administrative reform and legisla tive change and amendment. In 1948,  for  example, NYCLA  launched  an  attack on court calendar congestion  which resulted in legislation and the  appointment of special pretrial refer ees in negligence cases. In 1952, the as sociation  recommended  to Congress  that ""immediate action be  taken  to  insure  the  adoption of appropriate  rules and regulations  to govern and  control the operation of all investigat ing committees"", resulting in hearings  by  the House Rules Committee.  In  1977, responding to a crisis caused by  overwhelming volume  in  the motion  part of the Supreme Court, New York  County, NYCLA's voluntary assistance  to the courts program developed a spe cial masters program, resulting in the  creation of a special term, part lA, and  referral of thousands of cases to sever al hundred volunteer  attorneys.  In  1982, several recommendations for ad ministrative changes reported out by  the Committee on the Federal Courts  were accepted by the Chief Judge of  the U.S. Court of Appeals, 2d Circuit.  Committees,  as  appropriate, meet  with the judiciary and court staffs to  discuss mutual  problems, whether  originating with the court or practi tioners. The informal setting and tone  of such meetings are no small factors  in the achievement of greater under standing and efficiency.  NYCLA is unusual, if not unique, in  the accessibility of committee assign ments  to all of  its members. As  a  result, our younger  lawyers-in  the  first 10 years of professional practice constituting approximately 40 percent  of our membership, are exceptionally  active.  NYCLA  committees  comment  on  proposals by the New York State and  American Bar Associations, in matters  impacting on the legal profession and  the public, Government  involvement  affecting the profession, and a wide  range of subjects of  import  to  the  practitioner.  PRACTICAL LEGAL EDUCATION  The PLE series was initiated in 1974.  Courses range from the basic, ""Gener al Practice for the Newly Admitted At torney,"" given every year, to such spe cialties  as  estate,  bankruptcy,  tax ation, matrimonial, real estate, and im migration  practice.

186,,98,0.284,1364,7,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to call to the attention of my col leagues the following thought-provok ing  column  in  today's Washington  Post by George Will:  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 19831  BLIND EYE ON CENTRAL AMERicA  <By George F. Will)  To begin, a two-question quiz.  First question: since d~tente was codified  at the Nixon-Brezhnev summit in 1973, the  Soviet Union has forced a nuclear alert by  threatening to intervene with troops in the  October 1973 war in the Middle East <a war  incited and financed by the Soviet Union>;  has organized and financed the destruction  of the Paris accords and a U.S. ally; has in tervened with Cubans and others in Angola,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ethiopia, Yemen, Cambodia, Nicaragua and  El Salvador; has invaded Afghanistan; has  orchestrated  the crushing of Poland; has  made a mockery of the Helsinki agreements;  has  repeatedly  violated  the  informally  agreed-to  threshold  test ban  treaty <al though we even changed the way we meas ure violations, in an effort to avoid the need  to make protests that would dampen de tente>; has tried to murder the pope; is vio lating the terms of SALT II (an amazing  feat, considering that SALT II is a tissue of  loopholes and ambiguities>; is funding and  organizing terrorism worldwide; and is con tinuing an arms buildup unambiguously de signed for political  intimidation and mili tary aggression. The first quiz question is:  why is there a ""return to the Cold War""?  Answer: President Reagan gave a speech  referring  to  the Soviet Union as an evil  empire.  Second question: the Soviet Union has an  army brigade (2,600-3,000 men), 2,500 mili tary advisers (increased 500 last year) and  6,000-8,000 civilian advisers in Cuba. It gave  Cuba 66,000 metric tons of military supplies  in 1981, 68,000  in 1982 <worth $1 billion).  Moscow's annual economic aid to Cuba is $4  billion <more  than one-quarter of Cuba's  GNP>. Cuba has 200 MiGs,  including  two  squadrons of MiG-23 Floggers, at least 650  tanks,  at  least  90  helicopters,  including  MI24 attack helicopters, a Koni-class frig ate, two Foxtrot attack submarines, at least  50 torpedo attack boats, two amphibious as sault ships. A Grenada minister says Cuba  will use Grenada's new airport when supply ing Cubans in Africa. Cuba, with one-sev enth of Mexico's population, has military  forces twice the size of Mexico's. The Soviet  Union is giving 20  times more military as sistance to Cuba than the United States is  giving to all of Latin America. In the newest  Soviet satellite, Nicaragua, 39 percent of all  males over  18  are  in uniform,  and  the  regime  intends  to build a  250,000-person  armed force, so one in 10 Nicaraguans will  soon be in the military or militia. <All of  Honduras' security forces  total 20,000. El  Salvador's total 32,000.) Nicaragua's regime  has built 36 new military bases and garri sons <the previous regime had 13). Nicara guan pilots and mechanics are being trained  in Bulgaria. The regime has received, so far,  50 Soviet tanks, 1,000 East German trucks,  100 anti-aircraft guns, Soviet !52-millimeter  howitzers with a range of 17 miles. Cuba has  4,000 to 5,000 civilian advisers in Nicaragua,  plus 2,000 military and security advisers.  There also are East Germans, Bulgarians,  North Koreas, Soviets and members of the  PLO. The second quiz question  is: about  what  in Central America does Congress  seem most worried?  Answer: fifty-five U.S. trainers in El Sal vador.  Events  in Central America are spinning  rapidly toward a decisive moment in U.S.  history. None of the fictions that were used  to rationalize acceptance of defeat in Viet nam can be used regarding Central America.  The threat there is close, clear and indisput ably communist. There the United States  will  show-will  learn-whether  it  is  any  longer capable of asserting the will a great  power requires, or whether the slide into pa ralysis is irreversible.  Governments such as Costa Rica's and  Panama's are  listening  as  congressional  complaints mount.  The  complaints  are  against U.S. assistance to armed opponents  of Nicaragua's Stalinists, and about even  minimal aid for the democratically elected  government of El Salvador that is under  April 21, 1983  attack  from  forces  that  are  extensions,  through Nicaragua and Cuba, of the Soviet  Union.  The conjunction of these complaints can  mean, in effect, the extension of the Brezh  nev doctrine  in this hemisphere. That is,  communist attacks on a regime leech away  the regime's legitimacy, and produce pres sure for negotiations aimed at ""power-shar ing"" with Stalinists who do not believe in  sharing power. But a communist  regime,  however freshly planted and dependent on  foreign totalitarians, as in Nicaragua, must  be treated as legitimate and irreversible.  There is a war raging, and if all the sub stantial, determined military assistance  is  one-way, there can be but one result. The  result will be a communist Central America,  and an Iran  just a wade across  the Rio  Grande.e  THE  MARYLAND  COMMITTEE  FOR  CHILDREN  PROVIDES  CHILD  CARE  INFORMATION  AND REFERRAL  HON.

188,House,98,-0.145,1377,7,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, supporters  of House Joint Resolution 13, which  calls for a mutual and verifiable freeze  in the development, production, and  deployment of nuclear weapons, and I  include myself among its supporters,  claim the freeze could bring a dramat ic halt to the nuclear arms race, with out jeopardizing our national security.  In a particularly cogent article pre pared  for  the Washington  Post,  former Director of the Central Intelli gence Agency, William Colby, agrees  with freeze proponents and declares  further  that it would end President  Reagan's policy of appeasement. It is  one of the best statements in support  of the freeze resolution that I have  seen and I urge my colleagues to read  it.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post]  REAGAN SHOULD TuRN FRoM ""APPEASEMENT""  TO A FREEzE  (By William E. Colby)  To use language meaningful to those of  President Reagan's generation  <and my  own), appeasement doesn't work. I am sure  the president would agree with that state ment, but in fact, he is engaged in a pro gram of appeasement. NATO's first resolute  decision to deploy 108 Pershing II missiles  and 464 cruise missiles to meet the Soviet  8820 buildup has been  followed by  the  president's proposal of a  zero option on  both sides, rejected by the Soviets, and then  a suggestion for an interim solution, also re jected by the Soviets.  The president's proposal to supplant the  SALT II treaty by the START proposal to  reduce strategic launchers to 850 on each  side and warheads to 5,000, no more than  half of which would be land-based, has been  rejected by the Soviets. The U.S.S.R. made  a minimal move in our direction by suggest ing an 1,800-launcher limit. The administra tion now considers means by which it could  move off its original proposal  toward the  Soviet position.  Another appeasement being attempted is  of the anti-nuclear and nuclear freeze move ments in the West. The political force of  these movements led the administration to  soften its previous positions, in hopes of di luting the impatience of millions of Europe ans and Americans over their governments'  inability  to  reduce  the nuclear  terror  to  which they are exposed. Minor variations of  the degree of terror certainly are not going  to appease  these movements, particularly  when these gestures are matched by plans  to bring in new weapons systems like the  MX, the 05, the B1, and a whole new di mension of space warfare.  The real requirement is for a bold move to  halt the arms race, as a clear indication of  resolution to reduce the nuclear terror to  which all our populations are subjected.  This is the basis for the call for a mutual  and verifiable freeze on the testing, produc tion and deployment of nuclear weapons  and their delivery systems. A recitation of  what this freeze will produce in benefits to  the safety of the United States is a compel ling argument for Regan to leapfrog the ob structionists who urge his to oppose it and  instead take leadership of it.  A simple projection of current weapons  plans that would be obviated by a  freeze  demonstrates its value to the safety of our  country:  (1 > A freeze on new types of land-based  missiles permitted under SALT  II would  halt the present Soviet testing of two new  types. It would also halt the MX. The prime  characteristic of these new weapons is an in crease in accuracy and consequent targeting  of  the  land-based missile systems of  the  other side. While the so-called ""first-strike""  scenario is discussed as a theoretical possi bility today, the advent of these new weap ons systems will bring it remarkably closer.  Both sides will be convinced that the other  will soon have the potential for a single dev astating blow, requiring that it keep itself  on hair-trigger alert for an equally devastat ing response. The decision time in such cir cumstances will be reduced so that automat ic, not human, decisions will have to be pro grammed, offering the sickening prospect of  mutual destruction through machine error.  (2) A freeze would bar the development of  cruise missile armadas on both sides. While  the United States is technologically ahead  with this new device to date, it is predictable  that the Soviets will develop their own capa bility within the next decade. They did just  that with respect to the MIRV, after it was  left out of SALT  I  in 1972 because  the  United States had no incentive to bar itself  from something the Soviets did not then  have. At the end of this decade, we can con fidently expect a national debate over the  need  for  a  comprehensive  air  defense  system to protect the United States from a  Soviet cruise missile armada. This whole de velopment would be eliminated by a freeze  today.  (3) A freeze would bar the further devel opment and deployment of the Blackjack  bomber on the Soviet side and of the Bl on  the American side. This would have to be  clarified in the discussions  leading to the  freeze agreement, but it seems clear that  the strategic arms negotiating history con siders intercontinental aircraft to be launch ers rather than platforms. Again, this would  prevent the buildup of a large Soviet inter continental nuclear air force requiring the  kind of air defense system the Soviets are  now hoping can hold off at least some of  our B52s.  (4) The freeze would bar the development  of the D5 missile by the United States, with  its improvements in accuracy leading to the  danger of first strike from the sea. Similar ly, it would bar a more accurate Soviet sub marine-launched missile. It would not bar  the replacement of Polaris submarines by  Tridents because  the negotiating history  has  considered  submarines  as  platforms  rather than as launchers. The Soviets are  currently considerably behind  the United  States in submarine technology, but again it  can be confidently expected that they will  improve over the next decades through a  combination of espionage, allocation of re sources and talent, and plain competitive de termination. A freeze on launchers would  limit the application of those improvements  in the nuclear dimension.  Each of the arguments against the freeze  collapses under careful examination:  (1) The Soviets are certainly not ""superi or"" to the United States in any meaningful  way today. If they were, we would see them  using that superiority, rather than indicat ing concern over the technological superior ity of the United States and its ability to  leap ahead  in  technology  in  the coming  years at a pace beyond that possible for the  Soviet Union. The present American retalia tion potential is absolute, and with a modi cum of maintenance,  its components will  not vanish from old age.  The Soviets  restrict  their  adventurism  these days to the safer techniques of proxy  war, subversion and attempts to encourage  weakness of American will and separation  from European opinion. This is not the blus ter of someone convinced that he has the  power  to dominate.  It is  the wiliness of  someone operating from a position of weak ness,  trying  to  slow  the opponent down  without direct confrontation.  (2) Could we verify whether the Soviets  would abide by such an agreement? The ad ministration's own reports show that we are  doing exactly that in our attention to poten tial violations of SALT II and the steady  buildup of Soviet power. The fact is that  our intelligence system will cover the Soviet  Union's nuclear weaponry whether there is  a freeze between us or not; a freeze treaty  would merely make it easier to do so be cause of the numerous elements included in  recent  treaties  to  facilitate  the process.  Even in areas of ambiguity, of which there  will certainly be some, such as the current  indications of Soviet violation of the chemi cal and biological treaty, it is plain that our  intelligence systems have picked up these  activities. They have not occurred without  being exposed to outside scrutiny.  The fact that the Soviets might violate a  treaty  is  not  the determinant. No  one  should ""trust"" them not to do so. The real  point is whether we would catch them at it  and be able to act upon that information.  The evidence  today  indicates  that this  is  clearly the case. Any violation that would be  extensive enough to have an impact on the  strategic balance would certainly be noticed  by us.  The real question is what we proposed to  do about a violation rather than whether we  would know of it. In this respect, there are  improvements that can be made in proce dures, such as third-party investigations and  decisions, interim sanctions and greater visi bility upon challenge.

189,Senate,98,0.084,43,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I sup port the conference report and I com mend  the chairman of  the Budget  Committee and the conferees.  I  believe  that  the  central  issue  before us is the need to reduce deficits  in order  to  insure  lasting economic  growth and jobs. This budget resolu tion does reduce deficits; it does assure  financial markets that there is a will  in this Congress to reduce the huge  demand of Government debt on pri vate capital markets. It assures that as  the expansion continues, there will be  adequate funds at reasonable interest  rate to fuel continued growth.  Furthermore this resolution calls for  lower  deficits  than  the President's  budget as revised in April would have  entailed. The resolution envisages a 3year total deficit of $471.2 billion; the  President's  revised  budget  deficit  would total $513 billion over the same  period.  Now there are some who claim that  this resolution is deficient because it  achieves deficit reduction through rev enue  increases  rather  than  through  spending cuts. In fact the resolution  calls for less spending than does the  President's budget  request. As  the  chairman has pointed out, the confer ence resolution provides total outlays  of $2.719 trillion over the next 3 fiscal  years,  but  the  President's  request  called  for $2.724  trillion-$5 billion  higher  than  the  conference  agree ment.  I am constrained to point out that  relying  on  spending  cuts  alone  to  reduce deficits is futile. The votes do  not exist in this or the other body to  implement  this strategy. The Hatch  substitute  to  the budget  resolution  won only 23 votes, Hollings substitute  only 16. To argue that the correct way  to reduce deficits is through draconian  spending cuts that simply cannot be  enacted is,  in my view sophistry. To  borrow a phrase, it is voodoo budget  policy.  I regret that the effort to pass this  budget has been so difficult. I believe  that the President has an important  stake  in strengthening  the congres sional budget process. His own pro gram of spending cuts and tax cuts  could not have been enacted in 1981  without the reconciliation procedures  provided by the budget process.  ",1983

191,Senate,98,-0.328,69,13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased  to  join Senators RIEGLE and  PELL in sponsoring the ""School Facili ties Child Care Act of 1983.""  On June 9, Senator SPECTER and I  convened the first policy forum of the  Children's Caucus. That  forum  fo cused on  the problems  confronting  latchkey children or those youngsters  who must care for  themselves after  school.  At that forum, we learned that be tween 6 and 15 million American chil dren could be home by themselves be tween the hours of 3 in the afternoon  and 6 or 7 in the evening. Such chil dren may face four serious risks. They  may be injured accidentally or victim ized. They may become less willing to  tackle school assignments because no  one is home to help them. They may  end up feeling lonely or bored. And,  they may act badly, vandalizing neigh borhood property.  We must provide latchkey children  with  alternatives  to  staying  home  alone if we are to protect them from  such risks. Afterschool programs pro vide alternatives.  At the June 9 forum, we heard from  two afterschool programs. The first,  Park Elementary  in Anne Arundel,  Md., is funded under a 2-year action  grant. After that 2 years, their fund ing runs out. The second, the Hearst  afterschool program  in Washington,  D.C., is funded entirely by tuition paid  by parents. The director of the Hearst  program spoke at  length about  the  numbers of parents in the District of  Columbia who cannot afford  to pay  tuition for afterschool care.  This legislation would allow HHS to  make grants to both private and public  services in public schools_ As such, it  recognizes  that the Federal Govern ment should play a role in fostering  partnerships between public  schools  and communities. Such partnerships  will help us solve the latchkey prob lem.  I urge my colleagues to join with me  in sponsoring this legislation to help  meet the pressing need for afterschool  care in this country    ",1983

195,House,98,-0.465,121,13,Mr. SHANNON.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  I seek this time to clarify something  that was said earlier. The gentleman  from Texas was  indicating that two earner  families  in  the  $30,000  to  $40,000  range would be experiencing  large tax increases under this proposal  when, in fact, I would point out to the  gentleman that only 2 percent of the  thank the gen taxpayers  described,  the  two-earner  family, $30,000 to $40,000, only 2 per cent of them would be affected at all  by this cap. They would be affected to  the tune of $43 a year or an average of  80 cents a week.  We are going to hear a lot of facts  later in the day, a lot of misstatements  of fact about what this cap does. But  let us make a few things clear.  Only 10 percent of the taxpayers in  the  country  are  affected  by  this.  Eighty-nine percent of the burden of  increased taxes will rest on people who  earn over $50,000,  and  the  tax  in creases,  the very small tax increases  that fall on people under $50,000 will  fall on a  very  small percentage of  people who earn under $50,000.

One-half of all of the jobs in Amer ica are provided by small business; 70  percent of  the new  jobs come from  small business.

So  there  is approximately a $10 billion  difference; an add on of $10 billion by  this conference report before us.  ",1983
202,House,98,-0.303,160,13,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Speaker,  the  choice we face today in voting on the  conference report on the first budget  resolution for fiscal 1984  is  really a  very simple one: Do we do the respon sible thing by voting for a budget out line to give ourselves and the country  a clear signal as to what our actions in  the next year are to be, or do we, by  defeating this resolution, commit our selves to a year of economic chaos by  closing our eyes to the hard choices  that have to be made, and just pretend  that if we ignore them, all our prob lems will go away?  For my part, I intend to choose the  first option. I am under no illusions  that the budget we have before us is a  perfect piece of budgetary planning.  Any document  that is  the result of  good  faith  bipartisan  compromise  seldom pleases anyone in all its parts.  For instance, I am still disturbed by  the inordinately high deficits that this  budget produces. Similarly, I am dis turbed by the fact that little attention  is paid to the rising costs of entitle ment programs. We  as  a Congress  must act, and must act soon, to revise  the system under which COLA's in  these programs are determined, and I  am disappointed that this resolution  does not begin that process. Finally, I  am less than satisfied by the inclusion  in this resolution of the so-called re serve fund. Frankly, to my mind, this  inclusion merely muddies the issue of  what the true deficit picture in this  resolution is. The one saving grace in  this situation is  that if these funds,  some $8.5 billion, are not used for spe cific  recovery and growth programs,  they cannot be used for any other pur pose, and thus would be available for  deficit reduction. I intend to examine  very closely any programs that are to  be funded under this reserve fund. At  this point in time, I would have to say  very frankly that I would prefer to use  these funds for deficit reduction pur poses, rather than new spending pro grams.  All that having been said, however,  there remain some very good reasons  to support this resolution. First, defi cits are significantly reduced both in  fiscal 1984 and in future years. Com pared to present policies now in place,  passage of this resolution will result in  deficit  reductions, excluding possible  Reserve funded programs, of $16.9 bil lion in fiscal 1984 alone. In the years  from 1984 through 1986, these deficit  reductions will  total  $124.4  billion.  This is no small saving. While the defi cits planned for here are still too high,  they represent a significant improve ment over present policy.  Second,  the  resolution provides  a  real  5-percent  increase  in  defense  spending. There is no one in this Con gress who believes more firmly  in a  strong national defense than I do, but  the  incredibly wasteful proposals of  the administration to double the size  of  this  large  increase with wish  list  philosophies of weapons procurement  are simply not acceptable. We learned  a  very hard  lesson  in  this country  when we destroyed the national con sensus for social programs by waste fully throwing money at them without  a careful examination of our priorities  and real needs. The administration's  present position on defense spending  threatens to similarly destroy the na tional consensus  for  a  stronger de fense, and I will play no part in such a  destruction.  Third, the House and Senate confer ees have agreed, in this resolution, on  a 3-year total tax increase of $73 bil lion to reduce long-term deficits when  the recovery is well established. This  may be the most controversial element  of the resolution, and I am sure it will  be the object of a great deal of distor tion. However, if we look at the facts  of the situation, something fairly sur prising  comes  to  light. Under  the  President's  proposals,  revenue  in creases in 1986 will result in a  total  picture of revenues as a percentage of  gross national product of 20.2 percent.  Under the resolution,  revenues as a  percentage of GNP in 1986 will be only  19.9 percent. In other words, the reso lution before us actually represents a  decrease  in taxation from  the Presi dent's  proposals.  In  effect,  then,  anyone voting against this resolution,  and supporting the President's propos als, is calling for an increase of taxes  as a percentage of GNP.  Fourth, the reconciliation language  of this resolution calls for deficit re ductions of $85.3 billion over the next  3 years. Reconciliation will take place  only if a budget is passed. In the plain est possible terms, failure to enact a  budget  this year will  result  in  in creased deficits of $85.3 billion over  the next 3 years. The abandonment of  the budget process will open the flood gates of overspending, without a sensi ble rein on the spending proclivities of  both the administration and the Con gress.  Finally, we have been told that the  administration  does  not  care  if  a  budget passes. In fact, it would almost  prefer that it does not. This is a very  curious position to take for an admin istration  which  keeps  proclaiming  loudly, to anyone who will listen, that  it is a staunch advocate of fiscal re sponsibility. An  editorial  from  the  June 22, 1983, issue of the Washington  Post summarizes  this situation very  well. In that editorial, which I ask per mission to insert into the RECORD at  the conclusion of my  remarks,  the  statement is made that the President  ""apparently sees more political advan tage  in disrupting congressional  at tempts to curb the deficit than in pro viding the leadership for a reasonable  compromise."" That is a strong charge,  and I sincerely hope that it is not, in  fact,  true. The budgetary process of  this Government is too important to  be made  into  a  political  football,  where political advantage, rather than  the national good, is the primary moti vation.  This  resolution,  as  I  have  said  before, is not perfect. It is the result of  a compromise between men of good  will who, although they may have dif fering political parties, and contrast ing philosophies, have come together  in a spirit of compromise and concilia tion to provide a reasoned, moderate  budgetary  pattern  for  the  coming  fiscal year. To  reject  the results of  their labor is to reject a plan that will  reduce deficits, provide meaningful in creases in defense spending and, in the  long  run,  reduce  the percentage of  taxes that we ask our citizens to pay.  To reject all of these things in favor of  cheap political grandstanding  is be neath the dignity of this Congress.  I urge my colleagues to do the re sponsibile thing, and vote for this reso lution. At this point I include the fol lowing editorial:  [From the Washington Post, June 22, 19831  BUDGET PROGRESS  As  ""Somewhat of  a miracle."" That's how  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete  Domenici described the accor!f reached by  budget conferees on Monday night. Perhaps  that's  an  exaggeration,  but miraculous  things can happen when hardworking legis lators sit down in a spirit of comity to work  out their differences.  they  JllOVe  the  budget  resolution  toward passage by the full Congress, con gressional leaders will still have to overcome  the  same  obstacle  that  has  impeded  progress thus far. That obstacle is the presi dent, who apparently sees more political ad vantage  in  disrupting  congressional  at tempts to curb the deficit than in providing  the leadership for a reasonable compromise.  Congress has every  reason  to  feel  ag grieved by  the president's behavior, since  the poor choices that it faces-the need to  cut spending, raise taxes and still face enor mous deficits-are so much the administra tion's doing. Nor does the president's cur rent position make much substantive sense.  For example, on taxes, the resolution calls  for $12 billion more in revenues next year  than the president's budget. The president  says those taxes will hurt the recovery. But  it is inconceivable that a $12 billion tax in crease will have any negative effect on a $3  trillion economy already  fueled by  three  years of massive deficit spending. It might,  however, have the beneficial result of calm ing the interest rate, which is already show ing renewed signs of anxiety over the pros pect of uncontrolled future deficits. As for  the tax increases proposed for subsequent  years, in opposing them the president is es sentially contradicting his own budget-or  giving further plausibility to the notion that  his ""standby"" taxes were only window dress ing to diminish the gargantuan deficits that  would otherwise have been evident.  For  the military,  the  resolution would  boost annual spending authority to $268.6  billion, an  increase of $24 billion. Actual  purchases next year would rise still faster  because of  the huge backlog of weapons  ",1983

205,House,98,0.382,173,13,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in opposition to this betrayal of  the American taxpayers. Let there be  no mistake-this proposed cap on the  July 1 tax cut is a working couples' tax  increase. And at a time when the econ omy  is making,  sure,  but  fragile,  progress toward recovery, the country  can ill afford to take more money out  of the wallets of working Americans  and  to undermine  the  incentives  to  work and save which the President's  tax relief plan has created.  Claims that this third year tax cut  benefits only  the wealthy are pure  nonsense. Almost half of those affect ed by  this cap have  incomes under  $50,000. It is also interesting to note  that a recent Gallup poll showed that  55 percent of all  respondents  favor  putting  the  tax cut  into  effect  as  scheduled  and,  interestingly,  that  among respondents with incomes be tween $15,000 and $25,000, 64 percent  support the tax cut. It is the middle  class who will be hurt by this cap, just  as  it has been the middle class who  has had to bear the brunt of so many  failures by Congress to see beyond the  political expediency of spend, spend,  spend budget policies that necessitate  tax increases.  As a small businessman and member  of the Small Business Committee,  I  am  particularly  distressed  that we  would consider a measure which would  make it more difficult for this impor tant sector of the economy  to grow  and  prosper. Eighty-six  percent  of  small businesses pay taxes under indi vidual  rather  than  corporate  tax  schedules and this means that nearly  2.5 million small businesses will see  their taxes increased if this $700 cap is  approved. Does  this say  to  the Na tion's small businessmen and business women-the backbone of our economy  and, I believe,  the key to recovery that we want them to suceed? No. It  just makes it harder for them to do so.  The problem is not the willingness  of  the American  taxpayers  to pay  their fair share, but the willingness of  the American Congress to make tough  choices. I submit that we will never see  complete  recovery until we have  a  Congress with the discipline  to stop  spending taxpayers' money as if it was  their own and the wisdom to stop pe nalizing initiative, hard work, and suc cess as if they were national embar rassments rather than tremendous national resources, of which I, for one,  am very proud.  Our constituents cannot afford any  more taxes. Let us stand up for their  rights and vote this irresponsible in crease down.  ",1983
206,House,98,0.217,173,13,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to this misguided and in equitable bill.  Mr. Chairman, every year this body  passes commemorative  legislation  to  designate days, weeks, years, in recog nition of outstanding achievements of  one group or another. Mr. Chairman, I  think this year should be designated  ""Congressional Irresponsibility Year.""  This will show the American people  that we in the Congress recognize the  fact that despite the Reagan adminis tration's valiant attempt  to foster a  strong and lasting economic recovery,  the House Democratic leadership has  done all it can to derail the President's  train of tax relief measures begun in  1981.  Thankfully,  they have  failed. But  they are now so desperate  to keep  their hands in the taxpayer's pockets,  they are resorting to shaking down the  little guy. Let's look at the facts. The  House's first concurrent budget resolu tion called for repeal of the July 1 tax  cut and income tax indexing. Failing  that, our friends on the other side of  the aisle now propose another plan  which would cheat the middle class  out of their portion of the Kemp-Roth  tax reduction by capping the July 1  tax reduction at $700. Although I real ize it is difficult for some to break old  habits,  it is  time  to teach these old  dogs new tricks.  Inflation-induced bracket creep,  in creased  social  security,  and  State  taxes, and  the August 1982 Federal  tax increase have joined to effectively  wipe out the first 15 percent of the  1981  tax reduction plan. On July 1,  the lower-and middle-income families  in the Nation will, for the first time,  reap  the  benefits  of  a  10-percent  across-the-board  reductions  in  their  marginal tax rates. Top bracket tax payers will not receive any relief from  the third year of the tax cut on their  income above $55,300 for singles and  $109,400 for joint filers. Clearly this is  a tax reduction that is well timed to  coincide with  the recovery and well  placed  to  give  those who  need  it  most-the  lowerand middle-bracket  taxpayers-an opportunity to increase  their disposable income.  Capping  the  tax cut at $700 does  little to provide ""tax equity"" between  lower and higher income brackets as  this bill purports. The cap  increases  the marginal  rates  in  the middle  brackets but would not increase the  50-percent rate that the affluent pay.  ",1983

208,House,98,-0.127,186,13,Mr. ROWLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I do  not believe that we are going to reach  any agreement today on whether or  not H.R. 1183  raises  taxes or  limits  cuts, but I believe we are all in agree ment on the need to reduce the budget  deficit.  I rise in support of the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Okla homa to link the level of the third year tax cuts with the ability of the  Congress  to reduce spending by  the  same amount.  .  I  certainly do not support  taking  money out of the pockets of the Amer ican  taxpayer  to use  for  increased  Government spending, but neither do  I  support  offering  exorbitant  tax  breaks when we are facing a $200 bil lion deficit.  When the 3-year tax reductions were  proposed in 1981, the assumption was  that the economy would improve, the  budget would be balanced, and  the  Government could afford to give the  taxpayers some relief.  We have seen our deficit go  from  $57.9 billion at the beginning of this  administration, and two tax cuts later,  it is approaching $200 billion.  There  is simply no  logic  in giving  taxpayers a few more dollars to spend  in a sick economy, when the Govern ment's efforts to cover the deficit are  keeping interest rates artificially high.  There has also been no evidence to  indicate  that  the  tax  reductions of  1982 have  resulted  in any  increased  spending or saving by those who bene fited.  Most of  those  individuals  in  the  $50,000 to $100,000 income bracket will  not experience significant changes in  their lifestyles with the additional 10percent tax cut.  The point is, however, that we must  be equitable in the distribution of the  burden of financing our Government.  Although many here say that to cap  the tax cut will mainly affect those  taxpayers under $50,000.  Perhaps  this  is  true,  in  absolute  numbers of people-for a rather obvi ous reason. The majority of the popu lation falls into this category.  But the fact remains that 89 percent  of the revenue generated by the cap  will . come  from  those making over  $50,000.  Are these the middle-income Ameri cans we are trying to protect? If demo graphics are of any importance in this  discussion, and  I  think  they are,  I  would like to point out that in my dis trict, less than 3 percent of the popu lation earn more than $50,000, and the  average income is around $16,000.  Approximately 88 percent of my dis trict will not be affected in any way by  the most  liberal estimates. This 88percent figure  is quite generous, be cause the assumptions upon which it  is based are that all of my constituents  are single, have no dependents, and do  not itemize on their tax returns.  In talking with the people of the  eighth district, I have been told time  and  time again  that  individuals are  willing to forgo the third year tax cut  completely, but only if the additional  revenue is applied toward the deficit.  This  legislation does not seek  the  repeal of the tax cut, but a fair com promise that the American people can  live with, if the deficit is reduced by  the same $6.2 billion that will be gen erated.  But  I  am  still concerned  that a  faulty perception exists that Congress  is voting to increase the taxes of every  working American, and this is just not  true.  If there  is a  smokescreen  to hide  behind in this issue, it is one of pro tecting the wealthy of this country to  the detriment of the middle-and-lower  income people.  Now is the time, if the Members of  this body are sincere in their commit ment to lower the deficit, to vote for  the McCurdy amendment and for final  passage of H.R. 1183.  These actions  are  indicative of a  desire to do more than pay lipservice  to reducing the budget deficit. I urge  my colleagues to take this opportunity  to show their true concern over our  Nation's overall economic health.  ",1983
209,House,98,-0.383,199,13,Mr. WRIGHT.," Mr. Chairman, there  are two very good reasons why this bill  ought to be passed today. The first is  that it reduced the deficit by $6.8 bil lion in the coming today. The second  is that it restores a semblance of fair ness to the tortured Tax Code through  which revenues have been drained by  the Reagan tax policies as through a  leaky sieve into the pockets of the fa vored few of this country.  Mr. Reagan preaches piously about  deficits; but the fact of the matter is  that his tax cuts for the wealthy, the  biggest  in history, have created  the  biggest deficits in history. The Presi dent's own budget  office  estimates  that his 1981  tax cut, most of it for  the most affluent, will cost the govern ment $609 billion by 1986.  In other  words, it will add $609 billion to the  deficits.  According to Secretary Regan in tes timony given before our Budget Com mittee, that tax cut of 1981 will drain  $135 billion away from the Treasury  this fiscal year and add $135 billion to  the deficit that now reaches $210 bil lion this fiscal year. It is the Reagan  deficit.  The Joint Committee on Taxation  reports that 35 percent of this enor mous loss will flow directly into the  pockets of the wealthiest 5 percent of  America's citizens, those who need the  tax cut the least.  This  bill would  not  recover  one  penny of the windfall that has already  gone to the fortunate few. It simply  places a  reasonable  limit upon  the  future drain of the Government's re sources into their already-swollen pri vate bank accounts.  It has been stated  repeatedly by  people on  the Republican side  that  this bill will not get a penny from the  biggest income Americans, and that a  $1 million taxpayer would get off scot  free. Well,  that  is  not what Alice  Rivlin says.  CLAUDE PEPPER, hearing that charge,  wrote a  letter today and asked Mrs.  Rivlin, Director of the Congressional  Budget Office,  exactly what would  happen to a $1 million income taxpay er as a result of this cap. I have her  reply  in my hand. She  said,  ""Mr.  Chairman, in response to your ques tion, a taxpayer with a million dollars  of income, filing a  joint return with  two dependents would have his tax cut  reduced by $3,736  if  the cap  is  im posed.""  In  other words,  he would  have  gotten an additional tax cut of $4,400  absent this bill; now he is going to get  a tax cut of $700 additional this year  instead if this bill is enacted.  Mr. Reagan came to office promising  a balanced budget by 1984. Do you re member that? Well, precisely because  he got his way in 1981 and 1982 and at  least partly because of his favored tax  treatment for the wealthiest few, the  Reagan deficit in 1983 will be $210 bil lion. That is more  than three times  higher than the highest deficit ever  suffered under any previous adminis tration.  If Jimmy Carter had presided over a  $210 billion deficit, there would have  been cries for his impeachment.  This huge deficit is the result of the  policy of spend and spend, borrow and  borrow, and pay and pay in tax wind falls to the wealthy few.  In 1980, Ronald Reagan blamed all  of our economic woes upon the Carter  deficit. Do you remember that? Well,  that deficit was about $57 billion. And  now, having personally engineered a  deficit in 1 year which exceeds all of  the deficits of the total 4 years of the  Carter  administration, Mr. Reagan  threatens to veto any bill that would  reduce his enormous deficit by $6 or  $7 billion.  Today, Mr. Reagan is speaking of his  new-found  concern  for  the middle income and the low-income taxpayers.  But his words have a hollow ring. It is  just exactly  like his new-found con cern  for public education, after his  personal efforts in the last 3 years to  rob public education of billions of dol lars of its needed funding.  0 1800  His  deeds  speak  louder  than his  words. Let us show you just how con cerned Mr.  Reagan  is  about  the  middle-income taxpayer. Last August  he asked over televison for increased  taxes on that middle-income  taxpay er's telephone bill, on his airline fare,  on his gallon on gasoline, and on the  medical bills that are paid by the indi gent. And now he wants an extra  standby surtax on the tax that this  middle-income  taxpayer  pays.  All  those  taxes are paid by middleand  low-income taxpayers. But Mr. Reagan  threatens to veto any bill that puts  any ceiling at all on  the additional  windfall tax cuts for the wealthiest 5  percent. That is  the measure of his  concern.  The Reagan administration has set  in motion the most retrogressive redis tribution of wealth in America's histo ry. From the pockets of the poorest  into the coffers of the richest.  In 4  years,  the Reagan  tax and  budget changes will  take $20 billion  away from households with incomes of  $10,000 and less and they will add $64  billion to the after-tax income of those  making $80,000 a year and more.  Mr. Reagan may consider people in  the $80,000 a year income moderate or low-income taxpayers. The average  taxpayer does not consider them such.  Mr. Reagan, himself, is reported to  have saved $90,000 on his taxes last  year because of the 1981 act.  Well,  in this bill  today, we  finally  say, ""Enough."" I do not think it is a  cheap shot to refer to the effects of  the 1981  tax cut upon those  in Mr.  Reagan's personal  income  range.  I  confess  to my colleagues personally  that it has meant money to me, it has  meant a  lower tax liability for me and probably for all of us here in this  Chamber today. But after all, let us  face it. Are we the average taxpayers,  are we typical of that average taxpay er for whom Mr. Reagan's heart pur portedly bleeds? Why, of course we are  not. We are not exactly typical of the  people who must  plow  their hard  earned money back into this economy  if we are to have a percolate-up action  that will start this economy moving  again. Those are the people who de serve a tax cut, the low and moderate  income  taxpayers, not the people at  the top of the economic pyramid.  So today, in passing this bill, we take  a first step away from the dangerous  precipice of  trickle-down  economics.  We make a modest beginning on defi cit reduction and we restore a modi cum of fairness to the badly ravaged  Code of Taxation. I ask you to join me  in taking that step today.  The CHAIRMAN.

214,House,98,-0.376,238,13,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, a  few  days ago on the floor of the House, I  denounced the Soviet Union's vicious  and officially orchestrated campaign  of anti-Semitism. The  latest step  in  this effort was  the creation of  the  Anti-Zionist Committee, which recent ly claimed that there are no Jews in  the Soviet Union who wish to emigrate  and charged Zionists with collaborat ing with the SS and Gestapo during  World War II.  Dr. William Korey, director of inter national  policy  research  at B'nai  B'rith International Council, has writ ten an analysis of  the new Jewish  policy of Soviet leader Yuriy Andro pov. Dr. Korey highlights the features  of that new policy beginning with the  background of  the creation of  the  Anti-Zionist Committee. He outlines  four features of the policy: First, an  end to emigration of Jews from the  Soviet Union; second, cutting ties be tween  the Soviet Jewish community  and Jews abroad;  third,  intensifying  forced cultural and linguistic assimila tion; and fourth anti-Zionist propagan da. This report has been copyrighted  and disseminated by the National Con ference on Soviet Jewry.  I  am  inserting  in  the RECORD  an  abridged version of Dr. Korey's analy sis:  ",1983
215,,98,-0.479,264,13,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing legislation today to reform  an excessively burdensome provision  of the medicare program.  As my colleagues know,  the basic  medicare hospital insurance program,  known  as part A,  is  automatically  available  to most  individuals when  they reach the age of 65. Those people  who during their working career-such  as teachers and other public employ ees-did not participate in social secu rity are not automatically eligible for  part A, but do have the opportunity to  purchase such coverage at a  rate of  $113 a month.  In addition, all medicare part A par ticipants have the opportunity to pur chase the supplementary medical  in surance, known as part B. This cover age now costs $12.20  a month and  covers physicians' and other services.  In each case,  the existing  law  re quires those eligible to purchase part  A or B coverage  to do so within 90  days of their 65th birthday. Anyone  purchasing part A or B coverage after  that  initial  enrollment  period  is  charged a penalty equal to 10 percent  for each year elapsed since the initial  enrollment period. Thus, individuals 1  year late in enrolling pay a 10-percent  penalty; those 2 years late pay a 20percent penalty, etcetera. This penal ty is paid each and every month of  coverage for the rest of the benefici ary's life.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  At the current rates, part A coverage  costs $113 a month. A 10-percent pen alty on top of this is $11.30, making  the  total monthly payment $124.30.  Medicare participants charged a penal ty are required under current law to  pay  that  penalty  each  and  every  month of coverage for the rest of their  lives.  These penalty fees can be a terrible  burden for seniors. To be sure,  the  Government has a legitimate need to  encourage prompt enrollment. With out such a penalty system, it would  only be natural for some individuals to  delay enrollment until the onset of a  major  illness. Such delays  in enroll ment would,  of  course,  deny  the  system significant revenues needed to  keep the system solvent.  On the other hand, in practice this  penalty-especially the part A compo nent-has  excessively  penalized  a  small  group  of  individuals. About  18,000 people nationwide-mostly  re tired public employees-purchase the  part A insurance, and only about 5,000  of them are paying some form of pen alty.  One group that I am aware of,  in  particular, are retired schoolteachers  in California, who believed  in good  faith that they had health insurance  from Blue Cross. That Blue Cross  policy was canceled, however, and by  the time the retired teachers learned  what had happened and understood  that they needed to sign up for medi care, many of them were assessed pen alties of from 1 to 3 years. Under cur rent law, these teachers will pay these  penalties for the rest of their lives.  My bill would keep the existing pen alty structure in place, with one signif icant change. Under my bill, the penal ty would be paid for twice the number  of years the enrollment was delayed  past the appropriate time, after which  the premium would revert to the regu lar monthly charge in affect at that  time.  Thus, someone 1 year late in enroll ing would pay a 10-percent penalty for  2 years; someone 2 years late would  pay a 20-percent penalty for 4 years,  and so on.  This legislation would apply to medi care  beneficiaries  currently  paying  part A or part B penalties. Such indi viduals would  receive  credit  toward  the total 6 years required for the time  they have already paid penalties. No  refunds, however, would be available.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is an  important  measure. For those who are forced to  pay it,  the penalty is a burdensome  and difficult requirement.  This is a moderate measure, which  attempts to maintain the basic prem ises  and  operation  of  the  penalty  system while at the same time elimi nating its most oppressive aspects.  I am pleased to have the support of  my colleague from California, Mr. PA NETTA, for this legislation, and urge its  June 23, 1983  careful and thoughtful consideration  by the Congress.

216,,98,0.173,264,13,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am plac ing in the record a  transcript of the  comments  Jerry  Greenwald,  vice  chairman of the Chrysler Corp. made  to  the  Congressional  Automotive  Caucus earlier this month. I strongly  recomment that my colleagues in the  House  read Mr. Greenwald's state ment. He offers an excellent insight  into some of the most important issues  facing the U.S. auto industry today.  JERRY GREENWALD SPEAKS ON AUTO  INDUSTRY SITUATION  Thank you all for coming this morning. I  think I understand very well now the advice  of a politician friend a few years ago when  he said, ""You have  to  remember  that if  you're going to come to speak in Washing ton, you have to learn how to speak and eat  at the same time."" I haven't learned that  trait as yet, and I think I'll just concentrate  on one of the two. I am both pleased and  privileged to be the first guest speaker of  the Automotive Caucus. I would like to do  everything I can both to offer our support  and to encourage you to make this caucus of  yours really become an important and for midable force in Washington. Others of its  type have worked very effectively and we  want to do everything we can to provide the  support that you would want of us.  A united front in Congress, when it comes  to the auto industry, can mean a great deal.  I can only emphasize to you what I suppose  you already know-that our industry, both  directly and indirectly, does represent em ployment for one out of six Americans in  our country. I'm not going to try to say to  you that what is good for the auto industry  is good for the Nation, but certainly some of  the remedies that will work for the auto in dustry will have the same impact for some  of the basic industry in the United States in  general. As we were discussing just a  few  minutes ago, I am happy to report that, for  now certainly, we see all the right signs that  Detroit is coming out of the doldrums. That  finally, having held our breath for 4 years,  the signs are up, car sales are up, employ ment  is beginning  to move. Some of our  plants are even working overtime.  I  think probably  the most  impressive  measure of the auto  industry's success  is  that Chrysler is making money. We, in the  first quarter of this year, in fact, we made  more money than any one quarter in more  than  54-55  years  of Chrysler's History.  That's still in an industry that is just begin ning to come out of recession. I think maybe  the best sign for you folks-I think I heard  a sigh of relief coming all the way from  Washington  into Detroit when we  an nounced that we are on the way to paying  off a full third of the loan guarantee pro gram. We're going to bring a great big check  on the 15th. We sort of tease some of the  ",1983
217,House,98,-0.402,316,13,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3190,  the Extra Long Staple Cotton Act of  1983. Extra long staple <ELS> cotton,  primarily grown domestically in three  States, including my district in west  Texas,  is known as the ""Cadillac of  Cotton."" This is because ELS is a spe cialty fiber used mostly in the manu facture of high-quality knitted prod ucts as well as sewing thread. Produc tion of the specialty fiber compared  with that of the more common upland  cotton  is on a much smaller scale U.S.  production  last  year  of ELS  cotton was 99,000 bales compared with  an upland figure of 11.9 million bales.  This bill would go a long way to af fording those farmers who grow ELS  cotton a greater degree of flexibility in  making their planting decisions and in  their ability to be competitive in both  the domestic and export markets. At  the same time that quotas and acreage  allotments  are  eliminated  for ELS  cotton, a mechanism is set in place to  guard against overproduction and de pressed prices.  Some of the key provisions of this  legislation  that should be noted  in clude:  The minimum price support loan for  ELS cotton would be 50 percent above  the rate established for upland cotton;  A target price program would be cre ated for ELS cotton, with the target  set each year at 20 percent above the  price support loan rate;  Existing legal authority for acreage  allotments would be terminated; and  Should the Secretary of Agriculture  determine that ELS suppliers were in  danger of becoming excessive, he could  require compliance with an acreage re duction program as a  condition  for  price support loans and  target price  protection.  Mr. Speaker,  this legislation repre sents the hard work of many diverse  interests  in  the ELS cotton growers  community, the textile industry, and  the USDA.  It  is  legislation  that  is  aimed at a  specific commodity and  that seeks to address the special needs  of those who must grow this precious  crop.  I am extremely pleased  to be  able to vote for this constructive legis lation that helps a vital constituency  not only within my district of west  Texas, but also throughout a tristate  area  in  the  Southwestern United  States.e  ",1983

224,Senate,98,-0.387,589,13,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, the  issue of abortion is one of the most  difficult matters  that comes before  this body. There are very strong views  on both sides, arising from deeply felt  personal convictions, religious beliefs,  and moral perspectives.  My own view  is  that abortion is a  tragic result for everyone concerned. I  believe that the real solution lies in  the development of public policies to  provide  realistic  alternatives  that  would  help  reduce  the number  of  abortions. Throughout my career  in  the Senate, I have actively worked to  develop such alternatives, particularly  through support of programs to make  safe and reliable family planning serv ices available to those who seek serv ices in order to avoid unintended preg nancies, to provide necessary medical  services to those women who seek to  carry a pregnancy to term, and to fa cilitate the availability of adoption for  women who choose that option.  However, the real issue before us is  not what the personal views of any  Member of this body are with respect  to abortion, but rather whether gov ernment-at any level-should be al lowed  to  intervene  in and  limit  the  choices of  individual women  in  this  most personal, private, and difficult  area. The Supreme Court held  10  years ago, and reaffirmed 2 weeks ago,  that if the right to privacy means any thing, it means the right to be free  from unwarranted governmental  in trusion in this area. Under the Consti tution, at present,  the question of  abortion is a private one with the deci sion as to propriety and necessity left  to the individuals and physicians con cerned. That is how it should remain.  That is the view held by the vast ma jority of Americans. National public  opinion polls repeatedly show that an  overwhelming majority feel that deci sions about abortion are best left to  those  involved, guided by  their own  personal beliefs and convictions, free  from governmental interference.  Mr. President,  the proponents of  this amendment seek  to  impose  the  views of one side of the abortion issue  upon  those who hold different, but  equally firm convictions. That goal is  in fundamental conflict with the basic  concept of  individual freedom which  Americans have always held dear.  It is also clear, Mr. President, that  the proponents of  this  amendment  will not achieve their goal, even if this  amendment were added to the Consti tution.  Passage and ratification of Senate  Joint Resolution 3 will not resolve the  abortion debate-it will only prolong  it.  It will not halt abortions, but merely  change  the conditions under which  they are performed and the price to be  paid, both  in human and economic  terms.  The abortion fights which have re peatedly  paralyzed Congress would  become regular events in State legisla tures and  the  rights of  individuals  would  be  subjected  to  continuous  shifting majorities in State legislative  bodies, with one side prevailing one  year, and the other the next.  In  those States where  abortions  became illegal, we would see a return  to the days when unskilled abortion ists preyed upon desperate women.  The abortion mortality  rate, which  has almost disappeared would again  rise. Legal and safe abortions, howev er, would remain an option for those  women able to travel to other States  or countries. The less affluent would  be denied those choices.  Mr. President, once before  in  the  history of this Nation, we adopted an  amendment  which  attempted  to  impose the moral convictions of one  segment of our society upon the rest.  The 18th amendment was a miserable  failure. It bred disrespect for the law  among our people, made criminals out  of otherwise law-abiding citizens, and  created an  industry of illegal profit eers and corruption. Adoption of this  amendment would invite the same dire  consequences.  Finally, Mr. President, there are sub stantial reasons to oppose this particu lar  amendment  irrespective  of  the  abortion  issue. Senate Joint Resolu tion 3 would establish a  dangerous  precedent  for  resolution of disputes  over what are unquestionably funda mental and deeply controversial mat ters.  Unlike  the various other proposed  constitutional amendments related to  abortion, Senate Joint Resolution 3  would not, by itself, outlaw abortion.  Rather,  lacking  the  consensus  or  public support necessary to achieve an  outright ban, the proponents of this  amendment seek to reduce a constitu tionally protected right  to one that  could be limited or denied by a simple  majority vote of a State legislature or  the Congress. Citizens would be forced  to negotiate on a State-by-State basis  to assert what had been a fundamen tal  right. What other  fundamental  rights might be subjected next to this  approach? Should freedom of speech  or assembly or minority rights be sub jected  to State-by-State  determina tion?  Our Constitution stands as a safe guard against governmental intrusion  into individual freedoms wherever one  resides in the Nation. This amendment  would alter that relationship and es tablish a precedent that could later be  applied to other basic rights-an intol erable result, I believe.  Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolu tion 3 is a bad amendment and it rep resents bad public policy.  I urge  its  defeat.  ",1983
225,Senate,98,-0.395,615,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, while I  shall vote against the Hatch-Eagleton  compromise  proposed  constitutional  amendment on abortion, Senate Joint  Resolution 3,  I happen to personally  oppose abortions which are not  the  result  of  danger  to  the mother's  health, rape, incest, or other unusual  circumstances. Were  I  asked  by  a  woman for advice regarding an abor tion,  I would advise her against  it,  absent  such unusual  circumstances.  My views are the product of my per sonal beliefs and morals. They differ  from the views of other persons, as is  evident  by  the  lack  of  consensus  among religious groups and the medi cal profession on the underlying ques tions relative to abortion. In the ab sence of such a consensus,  I believe  that the woman's right to make a pri vate  decision  concerning  abortion  should prevail as public policy, regard less  of our personal views  on  the  matter.  Mr. President, my objections to this  amendment are based principally upon  the views I have just outlined. There  are,  however, other  reasons why  I  cannot support this amendment.  The proposed amendment will not  put to rest the abortion controversy.  On  the  contrary-assuming  it does  have the effect intended by the spon sors of the amendment-it would sub ject the American public to a battle  over the abortion issue in each of the  50 States, since it would leave to the  determination of State legislatures the  question of whether abortion should  be restricted or prohibited altogether.  Nor would it remove the issue from  the Congress. Presumably,  the pro posed amendment would not affect  other possible sources of Federal au thority over  the regulation of abor tion, such as the commerce clause or  the spending powers. Since the amend ment  is silent on  the delegation of  powers between the States and Con gress, should it be approved, it is any body's guess what the rule of Congress  with respect to abortion will be.  Mr. President, whatever the resolu tion of our differences over the abor tion question, the law snould be uni form among the States. In Roe, the  Supreme Court recognized two important societal interests involved in the  abortion  decision-the  interest  in  ""protecting the potentiality of human  life"" and the interest in ""safeguarding  health and maintaining medical stand ards."" The Court's trimester approach  to determining when States have au thority to regulate abortions attempt ed to balance these sometimes compet ing interests.  While we might disagree with the  way the Court has balanced those in terests, I think we would all agree that  each of the interests identified by the  Court  in Roe  is  important. Because  the interests are so  important, I be lieve Americans have a right to uni formity  in the way the interests are  weighed. Under  the Hatch-Eagleton  amendment, the States would be free  to balance these interests as they see  fit, depending upon the views of a ma jorty in each State legislature. This  approach to the abortion issue would  result  in different rules  in different  States  and would  be  particularly  unfair  to  low-income  women. We  would be returned to a situation where  women with money could  travel  to  States where abortions are legal and  therefore  safer, while women who  could not afford to travel might again  resort to the ""back-alley"" abortion.  Our people are divided on the abor tion issue. But I believe most feel that  the same rule should be applicable as  a practical matter to all our people  wherever they live and whatever their  financial circumstances.  I am wondering, Mr. President, if I  might ask my friend, the Senator from  Utah <Mr. HATCH),  two or three ques tions  relative  to his  resolution,  the  constitutional amendment he has of fered? The first question is: Is there  any  implication  in  the sentence, ""A  right to abortion is not secured by this  Constitution,"" that abortion is prohib ited by the Constitution?  ",1983
226,Senate,98,-0.355,641,13,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, the Tax  Rate Equity Act we are considering  today achieves two very important ob jectives. First, it helps reduce our stag gering budget  deficit. But perhaps  more significantly, H.R. 1183 restores  much of the equity and fairness to our  tax system which has been lost during  the past few years.  The tax package enacted in 1981 re duced  revenues  to  the Treasury by  $1.1  trillion  from  fiscal  year  1982  through  fiscal year 1988. Last sum mer's tax increase bill recouped some  of this loss but left a staggering reve nue loss of $881 billion for the 7-year  period.  When the 1981 tax bill was enacted,  the administration assured us that the  revenue  loss would  be more  than  offset by  increased business  invest ments and increased savings. Yet the  predicted economic boom never came  to pass. Instead, we have been saddled  with the worst recession in this coun try in 40 years. Deficit levels are astro nomical.  In fact our problems with the Feder al  deficit may  actually  be  getting  worse. The Wall Street Journal report ed last week that the Federal deficit  totaled $29.29 billion for the month of  ¥ay. The deficit level for May 1982,  reached $18.9 billion. Administration  officials  indicated  that  this  year's  figure suggests a higher deficit level  for the year than originally forecast.  Indeed,  administration officials now  suggest  that  the  fiscal  1983  deficit  could reach $215 billion.  H.R.  1183  raises  a  significant  amount of revenue in the least painful  way available. It would raise $6.2 bil lion in fiscal year 1984. It would raise  $38.8 billion through fiscal year 1988.  H.R. 1183 produces prompt action to  stop the budget hemorrhage caused by  this administration's budget policies.  It is clear that a $700 cap on the  third-year tax cut is the fairest means  of reducing the deficit. The cap on the  tax cut restores some of  the equity  taken out of the tax system by this ad ministration  and  spreads  out  the  burden of economic sacrifice across all  segments of society. For too long this  administration has asked for sacrifices  to help us through our economic crisis,  but only from low-and middle-income  families.  The administration contends that a  $700  cap would  drown  the middle  class. This is curious when we consider  what  has  happened  to  America's  middle-income  earners  under  the  Reagan tax and budget packages thus  far. The Reagan tax cuts, when offset  by tax increases from social security  taxes and inflation, have resulted in a  22-percent increase in the tax burden  of  those  persons  earning  below  $10,000.  Persons  in  the  $10,000  to  $15,000 income group will see a 7-per cent increase in taxes. And those earn ing from $20,000 to $30,000 will shoul der a two-tenths of !-percent increase.  Yet,  if  you manage  to make  over  $200,000 and you will receive a 15-per cent decrease in your tax liability.  Further evidence of the administra tion's bias  toward  the well-to-do  is  found in studies done by the Congres sional Budget Office on the adminis tration  tax and budget changes  for  fiscal years 1982 through 1985. These  changes will  take more than $20 bil lion  from households with  incomes  below $10,000, yet  increase after-tax  income of households earning more  than $80,000 by $64 billion. An even  more glaring figure  is  the fact  that  fully 35 percent of the benefits gener ated by the 1981  tax cut go  to the  wealthiest 5 percent of American tax payers.  Is  this  concern  for  the middle income earners of America?  I  think  not, Mr. President. I think it is a con tinuation of  the  inequitable  trickle down approach which has guided this  administration.  The  administration  has  supported  increases  in gasoline  taxes which  are  clearly  regressive,  having a greater impact on the spend ing power of low-income groups. It has  supported  increases  in  telephone  excise taxes which have a detrimental  impact on our Nation's small business es. It has asked sacrifices of those who  wish to apply for student loans. It has  asked sacrifices from our military per sonnel. I feel that it is time we ask our  Nation's most prosperous citizens  to  sacrifice a portion of their tax cut and  to bear a fair measure of the burden  of cuts needed to sustain economic re covery.  I think we should stress, Mr. Presi dent, that nobody  is giving up their  tax cut. Our proposal retains the tax  cut. We are only advocating reducing  the size of the tax cut. As the Joint  Tax Committee's figures point out,  this proposal would reduce the size of  the tax cut only for an estimated 8.1  million  individual  taxpayers  in 1984.  This is roughly 10 percent of all U.S.  taxpayers. Thus, a full 90 percent of  our taxpayers would continue  to re ceive the full amount of the tax cuts  enacted in 1981.  The administration has argued that  many persons other than high-income  earners would  be  affected  by  this  measure. The  figures  dispute  this  claim. Only 9 percent of those earning  between $30,000 and $40,000 would be  affected by a $700 cap. Yet fully 93  percent  of  those  earning  between  $75,000 and $100,000 would see a re duction in the amount of their tax cut.  The fairness of  this approach can  also be seen by looking at where the  revenue raised by the cap would come  from;  89  percent  of  the  revenues  raised by  this bill would come from  taxpayers earning over $50,000; 60 per cent of  this sum comes  from  those  earning over $75,000.  Now,  these may be middle-income  earners in the circles the administra tion travels in, but a person with an  income level above $50,000 is still con sidered an upper  income earner by  Tennessee  standards.  Our median  family income in 1979 stood at $16,245  and only 4 percent of Tennessee fami lies were earning more than $50,000 in  that year.  H.R. 1183  also allows  the Federal  Government to raise revenues without  stalling our economic  recovery. The  tax cap still results in a tax cut of $24  billion in fiscal year 1984. This $24 bil lion will go far  in providing the  in creased purchasing power needed  to  continue our budding economic recov ery. As my colleagues know, lowand  middle-income  earners  tend  to  con sume a greater portion of  their  in comes than high-income earners and  these groups account for most of the  increase  in demand spawned by  tax  cuts.  Nor would a cap adversely affect the  backbone of our economy, the small  business community. Sole proprietor ships, the epitome of the American en trepreneur, accounted for 76 percent  of the total business establishments in  America  in 1979. Partnerships made  up 8 percent of the total while corpo rations represented 16 percent of the  overall figure.  11-059 0-87-21 (Pt. 13)  ",1983
227,Senate,98,0.275,693,13,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President,  today I am pleased to add a number of  my distinguished colleagues as cospon sors of amendment No. 1299, which  will require the Export-Import Bank  to do more business with small busi ness. When I  introduced the amend ment on May 25, Senator D' AMATo and  Senator PRESSLER were  inadvertently  omitted as original cosponsors. I have  asked unanimous consent that they be  added  as  cosponsors  and  that  the  RECORD be corrected to show them as  original cosponsors. Since  that time,  the amendment has gained momen tum and bipartisan support. Senators  GLENN,  HATCH,  GRASSLEY,  TSONGAS,  EAST,  COHEN,  HUDDLESTON,  HELMS,  HEFLIN, KASTEN, LUGAR, DURENBERGER,  and RANDOLPH are welcome additions  as cosponsors of the amendment.  I am especially pleased that Senator  GLENN has cospsonsored my amend ment because he has  introduced an  amendment that seeks the same goal.  I believe that now is the time for us to  join forces and demonstrate early on  that there  is strong, bipartisan sup port for giving small business better  access to Exim's programs.  I  just want to say one more thing  about Senator GLENN's amendment. It  is a good amendment  that contains  some provisions  that will strengthen  small business participation in Exim's  programs. I am pleased to join forces  with him and cosponsor his amend ment.  I will continue  to work with  Senator GLENN,  so  that when my  amendment  is  considered  on  the  Senate floor, his concerns will be ad dressed satisfactorily.

We have asked him to  keep  this Saturday's protest against  U.S. policy  in Central America from  being staged within obscenity-shouting  and  rock-throwing  distance  of  our  Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  The  issue, Mr. Speaker,  certainly  cannot be  free  speech. Lord knows,  any group of Marxists, peaceniks, and  assorted sixties leftovers is certain to  get their chance to mouth off in front  of the TV cameras most any time they  want.  But I, for one, resent seeing the pol ished black granite slabs of the Viet nam Memorial being used as the set  for  this anti-American extravaganza.  Most of all, I resent seeing the names  of  57,000  dead Americans  used  as  silent extras in a loud and sordid pro duction that will mock their patriot ism and their sacrifice.  It is time to bring the curtain down  on  this mockery. It is  really  just a  tired rerun of those street productions  staged a  few years back, with words  and music by Daniel Berrigan and  Abbie Hoffman.  This time, though, the arena is dif ferent. You can say what you want  about the design and  the setting of  the vietnam Memorial. But one thing  is certain-we built it for our brave  fallen soldiers, not Jane Fonda.

I also want to congratulate  the subcommittee's ranking Republi can, Mr. McDADE, for his great efforts  at arriving at funding levels which will  provide stability to our Nation's R&D  efforts. Furthermore, I would like to  compliment my committee chairman,  Mr. FuQUA, for his hard work in pro viding authorization  levels for  fossil  energy and conservation R&D activities that are almost parallel to those  contained in the legislation before us  today.  The  total program  level  for  fossil  energy of $327 million  represents a  positive increase over the administra tion's continued shortsighted requests  for  these R&D activities which are  vital to our Nation's energy independ ence. This body has repeatedly denied  these  going-out-of-business  budgets,  and I am sure we will continue to pro vide adequate support for these criti cal energy programs.  I am grateful to Mr. WHITTEN, Mr.  YATES, and the committee for provid ing $7 million for a comprehensive en vironmental monitoring program to be  carried out by DOE in support of the  Synthetic Fuels Corporation. My ef forts to obtain support for this activity  derive from a desire to see the con cerns of Congress and the public ad dressed regarding the health, safety,  water  resources,  and  socioeconomic  issues associated with the development  of synfuels projects. By allowing DOE  to operate  in a  technical consulting  role  supporting  the  SFC, we will  insure that the Nation's best technical  expertise  is  integrated and  that the  environmental monitoring  programs  will have technical program continuity  regardless of the status of the Syn thetic Fuels Corporation.  With regard to the funding provided  for conservation programs, I am par ticularly pleased to note that the com mittee sustained DOE's request for $9  million to begin construction of a High  Temperature Materials Laboratory at  Oak Ridge. I believe that the research  to be conducted at the HTML will pro vide valuable information and will lead  to advancements in the use of materi als critical to energy efficiency.

235,House,98,-0.237,771,13,Mr. FOWLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want to take this opportunity to ex press my support for the 1984 Interior  Department budget recommended by  the Appropriations Committee.  In particular, I would like to thank  Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  Chairman YATES  and his colleagues  for approving $1.388 million  in  the  U.S. Park Service budget for theM. L.  King, Jr., National Historic Site and  Preservation District.  The King Historic Site is an impor tant asset to Atlanta and the Nation.  Last year over 500,000 visitors came to  the park, not only to pay homage to  Dr. King but to learn more about the  story of the civil rights movement.  The historic site covers a  two-block  area encompassing the birth home of  Dr. King, his church, and his memori al gravesite. The preservation district  is composed of  the commercial and  residential  sections  of  the  Sweet  Auburn community in which Dr. King  grew up.  The $1.388 million budget for next  year will fund $500,000 for land acqui sition to acquire historic structures in  the area, $200,000 to restore the struc tures once acquired, $100,000 to devel op visitors exhibits, and $588,000  to  operate the park.  These funds are needed to continue  adequate development of  the park,  which is a relatively new unit of the  U.S. Park Service authorized in 1980  but first  funded  last year. For  this  reason, I strongly endorse the Appro priations Committee's  recommended  1984 funding for the King site.  ",1983
236,House,98,-0.258,771,13,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of  the  legislation, and  I  would like to take this opportunity to  express my sincere gratitude  to  the  chairman  and  ranking  minority  member of the Subcommittee on Inte rior-Mr. YATES and Mr. McDADE,  re spectively-for their guidance in bring ing this legislation to the floor today.  I know I speak for many in Califor nia-many members of the California  delegation, county governments, costal  businesses,  and  people who  simply  enjoy our State's attractive and pro ductive coast-in offering my thanks  to you for your efforts bringing this  legislation  to the floor. This legisla tion contains a provision which would  exempt a small, but vital percentage of  California offshore area from offshore  oil and gas leasing during the coming  fiscal years, while still enabling  the  Federal Government  to continue  to  pursue energy leasing in most promis ing California offshore areas. In fact,  this  provision would  exempt  from  OCS oil and gas leasing only 9.2 per cent of  the acreage currently under  consideration for possible lease during  the 1984 fiscal year,  leaving over 12  million acres of Federal offshore land  open for lease.  California has made in the past-and  will continue  to make-a significant  contribution to OCS oil and gas pro duction. During the third quarter of  1982, California produced on the aver age over 1.2 million barrels of crude oil  per day from State and Federal on shore and offshore lands.  It is clear that some of our State's  most promising oil-producing areas lie  in Federal offshore waters. The one half billion barrel pt, Arguello field,  Chevron's 100 million barrel Sockeye  field strike, and the oil-rich Santa Bar bara Channel are all certain to con tribute to our Nation's energy security  through  the coming years. For this  reason, none of these most productive  areas would be affected by the OCS  leasing provisions of this bill.  ",1983

Many reports indicate that the econ omy has taken a  turn for the better.  While  this might be true at the na tional level, there are many pockets of  unemployment where  the  economy  has not improved. In fact, in some of  these cases the economic situation is  deteriorating, which, in turn, effects a  chain reaction diminishing the quality  of life for large numbers of people.  I  represent  the  27th District  in  Texas.  This  extends  from  Corpus  Christi south along the gulf coast to  Brownsville. In general, our economy  revolves around fishing,  farming, pe trochemicals, and port-related activi ties with  the Brownsville area more  dependent on tourism and retail sales.  The  difference  between  these  two  major cities  in my district-the  two  cities are 150 miles apart-is dramatic.  While  the  unemployment  rate  in  Corpus Christi is at near-record levels  at 10 percent, the unemployment rate  in Brownsville  is a crippling 17 per cent.  ",1983
240,House,98,-0.306,823,13,Mr. RAHALL.," On behalf of the or ganizers  of  this  special  order  this  evening, my colleagues from West Vir ginia, Congressman WISE, Congress man  MoLLOHAN  and  Congressman  STAGGERS and my colleague from Ohio,  Congresswoman KAPTUR, we want to  thank all of those who have partici pated thus far this evening in this spe cial order and certainly  those who  have participated during the time that  I control, I want to extend my con gratulations on  statements  and  remarks very well written and spoken  from  the heart and very well  repre sentative of  their congressional dis tricts.  Mr. Speaker, tonight we heard the  President during his news conference  say  that the economy  is strong and  getting stronger. He went on  to say  that the American economy is begin ning to sparkle. For many in West Vir ginia, the only sparkle that they will  see during the months ahead may be  the sparkles of fireworks next Fourth  of July weekend. It is certainly not  any sparkle in the economy that they  are seeing. They have been without  jobs for several years now; they have  experienced not a recession but a de pression. And  it  is not getting any  better for  them. The issue of unem ployment has been a major  topic of  discussion on this floor of the House  of Representatives, not only in the last  several hours this evening but for the  last several years. During 1 minute  speeches, special orders, and debate on  various pieces of legislation, Members  have discussed the hardships of over  12 million Americans who are current ly without employment.  President Reagan takes great pleas ure  in  sharing with  the  public  in  speeches or at press conferences let ters  that he  receives  from  citizens  complimenting him on his work.  Rarely,  if ever, have  I heard him  refer to a letter which is  in disagree ment with him.  For this reason, I am happy to par ticipate in this special order and once  again  commend my  colleague  from  West Virginia for taking the time this  evening.  I  think  it  is  important as  many of my colleagues have already  done during  these special orders,  to  read what our constituents have to say  about the state of our Nation's econo my, letters that perhaps the President  has received also but to which he has  not referred in his press conferences  or speeches  to  the American people.  Before I do, however, I believe it is im portant to point out that in my dis trict the unemployment rate has gone  up in the last month. For that matter,  in five of the eight counties that com prise  the Fourth Congressional Dis trict in southern West Virginia the un employment rate has increased. If un employment is indeed one of the ""un fortunate evils"" of fighting  inflation  as this administration contends, then  why have we not turned the corner if  the economy  is  really here,  if  the  American  economy  is  truly gaining  strength?  The decrease in the rate of inflation  is  advertised as  the administration's  proudest achievement. Yet,  the facts  show that the average American is ac tually losing ground in real terms, as  per capita income in my State of West  Virginia is 20.3 percent below the na tional average. Corresponding  to  the  most recent statistics the percentage  of unemployed persons has increased  in southern West Virginia from 18.7  percent to 19 percent.  The number of  those out of work  has gone up from 29,130 to 29,390.  For  the  record,  I would  like  to  submit  the unemployment  totals for  the Fourth Congressional District for  May which show as follows:  In Cabell County the rate is 14 per cent,  Logan  County,  21  percent,  McDowell County, 30 percent. One of  the highest if not the highest unem ployment figures in the Nation for a  county and many in that county who  are affected would say that is on the  low side. Many in respectful positions  of leadership have said that the unem ployment in that county is approach ing 45 percent. Mercer County, 14.4  percent, Mingo County, 19.1 percent,  Raleigh County, 15.2 percent, Wayne  County,  12.9 percent and Wyoming  County, 25.7 percent rate of unem ployment for a district average of 19  percent.  The issue of unemployment is much  more human than these cold statistics  portray. From them we do not see the  unpaid bills, the hungry faces, the un certain  futures  and  the  shattered  dreams. In recent months I have been  saddened by many of the letters that I  have received from the people in my  district. They very clearly portray the  hardship,  frustration,  sense of  loss,  and the absence of any hope.  These individuals have worked for a  living before. They know what  it  is  like to put in a hard day's work for a  fair wage. They know what it takes to  pay bills, make mortgage payments  and to feed, clothe, and educate their  children.  It may sound corny but they do not  want handouts, they do not want to  stand in a welfare line, they want to  stand in a payroll line.  So,  tonight, Mr. Speaker,  for  the  President and for our colleagues who  do not see the need to participate in  this special order, I would like to read  just a few of the many letters that I  have received from constituents in the  Fourth District. They explain the situ ation much better than I could  this  evening and from a much more human  and personal standpoint.  From Accoville, W. Va.,  County, and I quote:  in Logan  ",1983

243,Senate,98,0.287,1005,13,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, Ire member when I served in the House of  Representatives  there was  a  great  debate about the fact  that the food  stamp program had gone completely  out of control. The distinguished occu pant of the chair probably remembers  that debate when it was first brought  up. There was a great deal of argu ment over how we would control the  cost of this runaway program, the cost  that was going to escalate to as much  as $5 billion a year.  There were great differences of opin ion about how you go about control ling the cost, because it was a period  of high unemployment and economic  recession. The cost of  the program  went up automatically,  in effect, be cause if a person was entitled to bene fits under the terms of the law,  the  Government appropriated the dollars  to meet its obligation.  There are a  lot of programs  that.  It is not a pure entitlement program,  because it does come up each year for  direct appropriations under the law by  which it was created. But it was never  intended, and this came out in debate  several years ago and I am sure other  Senators are familiar with this, that  the Congress would act to control the  program by capping the level of spend ing available during each fiscal year.  That was tried. That is what is being  attempted here, in a way.  I am not suggesting that the amend ment is not straightforward, because it  certainly is. But what it would do, in  effect, is hold the level of funding at a  point below which we anticipate the  programs to actually cost.  like  ",1983
244,Senate,98,-0.224,1096,13,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, when  the Rehabilitation Amendments  of  1983, S. 1340, comes before  the full  Senate for consideration, I will be of fering an amendment, on behalf of  myself, Mr. DOMENICI, and Mr. PELL to  raise the authorization ceilings for vo cational  and  adult  education  pro grams.  When Congress passed the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, we  placed a cap or ceiling on the amount  that could be appropriated for voca tional and adult programs at $735 mil lion for vocational education, and $100  million  for adult education.  In  the  case of vocational education, we did  not lower the maximum authorization  level of over $1 billion, we simply lim ited the amount that could be appro priated, through 1984, at $735 million.  For fiscal year 1983, vocational pro grams are funded at over $728 million,  just $7 million below  the cap, and  adult education  is receiving $95 mil lion, only $5 million less than the ceil ing. That leaves us in a real bind when  we sit down to determine appropria tions for fiscal year 1984 for these pro grams.  There is a general consensus that vo cational and adult education programs  are critical ones that should be main tained and continue growing to meet  the training needs of youth, and the  basic education and retraining needs  of adults.  We are still experiencing unemploy ment rates of over 10 percent. Unem ployment among black Americans  is  over 20 percent, and 45 percent of the  Nation's  black  youth  cannot  find  work. Yet our defense and domestic in dustries are facing critical shortages of  workers with high  technology skills.  Not too long ago we enacted a special  appropriations package to create jobs  through existing programs. No addi tional funds were added to vocational  or adult education programs because  of the ceilings. We are neglecting an  important rung in the ladder to eco nomic recovery if we do not adequate ly fund these programs in 1984.  The budget  resolution we adopted  has ample room to accommodate the  ceilings I am proposing with my col leagues  today. The House version of  the Rehabilitation Act  amendments  contains the same levels for vocational  and adult education. As the Education  Subcommittees in the House and the  Senate continue to work on the vari ous proposals to reauthorize vocation al education after 1984,  I  think we  ought to adopt these ceilings so the  program can continue the gains it has  made in the meantime.

245,Senate,98,-0.374,1109,13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, on May  20, 1983, I asked unanimous consent to  have printed in the RECORD some valu able material on a nuclear freeze pro posal prepared by Mr. Christopher  Paine of the Federation of American  Scientists. One of  the most useful  parts of that material was a  table 5  containing  the outline of a  compre hensive nuclear freeze and reductions  agreement. Unfortunately, table 5 was  not included in the material as printed  in the RECORD. This greatly diminishes  the value of Mr. Paine's excellent  statement on a nuclear freeze propos al.  I  ask,  therefore,  that  the  entire  statement of Mr. Paine before a panel  organized by the Federation of Ameri can Scientists,  including  the missing  table  5,  be printed  in  full  in  the  RECORD at this point.  The material follows:  [Prepared testimony of Christopher E.  Paine]  RETHINKING ARMS CONTROL: ADVANTAGES OF  ' A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH  The burden of my testimony today is that  a comprehensive approach to ending the nu clear arms race is both politically and tech nically feasible, and in fact offers distinct  verification and security advantages over  more limited approaches.  Although traditional thinking about arms  control comes encased in a veneer of pur portedly technical constraints, close exami nation  reveals  that  these are not purely  technical  constraints,  but  rather  limits  based on subjective-indeed highly politi cal-determinations of the ""national inter est"" and the fragility of the nuclear balance.  For example, if you believe that the balance  in specific measures of nuclear capability is  an oracle of geopolitical fortune, you will  probably demand high levels of on-site in spection to monitor each and every incre mental improvement in the Soviet nuclear  arsenal, on  the grounds  that  the United  States must be able to respond promptly to  Soviet efforts  to change  the balance, no  matter how small these may be in relation  to the total arsenals.  On the other hand, if you believe, as I do,  that the destiny of world affairs depends far  less on the balance in nuclear capabilities  than on the dangers arising from the race to  maintain  these capabilities,  then you are  likely to have a far different set of preferences. Specifically, if one reaches the con clusion that the nuclear balance is, within a  fairly broad range of disparities, inherently  stable with respect to the deliberate initi ation of nuclear conflict, then one is willing  to  tolerate  a  comprehensive  agreement  characterized by lower-levels of monitoring  confidence  for marginal  changes  in  the  Soviet arsenal, in exchange for a halt in the  overall process.  Between these  two extremes lies a wide  and fertile ground for exploration and com promise. It behooves us all to examine the  actual range of possibilities that really do  exist, rather than continue to dwell in the  small box <see Figure 1 > defined by  the  present Administration's  ideological  and  strategic preoccupations.  [Figure  1  not  reproducible  the  for  RECORD.]  For example, it is often said that in addi tion  to National Technical Means <NTM>  the Freeze will require ""on-site inspection,""  which the Soviets will presumably be un willing  to grant. What kind of National  Technical Means? What kind of ""on-site"" in spection? And can these be used in combina tion? There are many possible combinations  <Table 1) of current <and feasible near-term>  NTM, intrusiveness, frequency of coverage,  cooperative measures, and information ex change, yielding a wide  range of possible  confidence levels when applied  to a broad  spectrum of possible agreements. Some of  these possibilities are spelled out in Table 2.  [Tables 1 and 2 not reproducible for the  RECORD.]  EXPLANATION OF TABLE 2.-ILLUSTRATIVE  MODES OF MONITORING COMPLIANCE  Inspec 1. Remote monitoring by National Techni cal Means outside Soviet territory.  2. Remote monitoring by  tamper proof  NTM located within Soviet territory.  3. On-site monitoring by non-intrusive in spections using technical means.  4. On-site monitoring by mildly intrusive  inspections using technical means.  5. Intrusive ""Quota"" Inspections.  6.

Cooperative measures on request <re moval of shielding against NTM>.  10. Inspection by Interrogation, hierarchy  of requests for clarification and responses,  leading to a prima facie case of violation or  compliance with the right to request inspec tion to resolve doubts.  Similarly, the problem of treaty compli ance is not a simple ""yes they are-no they are not""; kind of problem. There is in fact a  wide range of possible forms of treaty non compliance <Table 3) and a wide range of  possible  responses  to  treaty  violations  <Table 4). We need to know, for example,  which violations in Table 3 should be paired  with which remedies in Table 4? What kinds  of  treaty violations  threaten our security  such  that  they would  justify abrogation,  and what kind of violations would merit  lesser actions. In short, there is a great deal  of investigation to be done here, and from  one perspective, perhaps the most we can  say is to admit the scale of our current igno rance and get to work. One way of looking  at the range of possibilities is summarized in  Figure 1, which attempts to show geometri cally how differences  in  three  important  subjective preferences relating to arms con trol can affect the domain of possible agree ment.

246,Senate,98,0.241,1122,13,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President. I am  greatly concerned that foreign policy  decisions often have been made with out  due  regard  to  their  economic  impact on U.S. business. A very signifi cant portion of this country's econom ic system  is highly dependent upon  foreign sales and purchases. A foreign  policy decision can have a devastating  economic impact on a domestic indus try. The 1980 Russian grain embargo  imposed by the Carter administration  is a classic example.  While I would not suggest that na tional security should be secondary to  economic  impact,  I  question  the  extent  to  which  economic  conse quences have been taken into consid eration-if at all-when foreign policy  decisions are made. In my judgment,  maintaining  incentives  and  rewards  within our economic system is also in  our Nation's interest. It is not in our  best interest to use ""national security""  as a catch-all excuse to justify unwar ranted  intrustion  into  international  trade.  With that thought in mind I asked  the General Accounting Office <GAO>  to  research  the organization of  the  Reagan administration's foreign policy  decisionmaking process and how com pensation is made to industries when  export controls are imposed.  I ask that excerpts from GAO's May  12 letter report, entitled ""Interagency  Structure of Economic and Foreign  Policy Decisionmaking"" <GAO/ID-8341), be reprinted in the RECORD.  The excerpts are as follows:  EXECUTIVE BRANCH ORGANIZATION  Under the Reagan administration,  inter agency policymaking is formally structured  and extensively used. High-level interagency  policymaking is carried out through a group  of senior interagency groups associated with  the NSC, and a number of cabinet councils.  Senior interagency groups <SIGs> are set up  under the NSC umbrella for foreign affairs,  defense policy, intelligence policy, and inter national economic policy. They are chaired  respectively by State, Defense, the Central  Intelligence Agency, and Treasury.  Inter agency groups <IGs> typically focus on limit ed  issues and have varying membership,  size, and responsibilities depending on the  issues under review. As may be expected,  the NSC groups are concerned mostly with  international political and military issues.  A series of cabinet councils set up by  President Reagan to deliberate administra tion policies are, on  the whole, concerned  with domestic issues. Such issues, of course,  encompass international economic concerns.  To date, seven councils have been estab lished, each chaired by the President with a  cabinet-level  chairman pro  tempore,  and  each group has an Executive Secretary in  the White House Office of Policy Develop ment at the level of Special Assistant to the  President or above.  The Cabinet Councils <and Secretary-rank  chairman pro  tempore> are: Economic Af fairs  <Treasury);  Commerce  and  Trade  <Commerce>; Food and Agriculture <Agricul ture>; Natural Resources and the Environ ment <Interior>; Human Resources <Health  and Human Services>; Management and Ad ministration <Counsellor  to  the President)  and Legal Policy <Attorney General).  The Cabinet Council on Economic affairs  has reportedly been the most active of the  councils. Although  it was  initially  envi sioned as a  forum  for domestic economic  concerns,  the council has considered such  international  issues as  the yen-dollar ex change rate and U.S. participation financial  institutions.  The Cabinet Council on Commerce and  Trade, has been a relatively active council.  It has operated in tandem with the Trade  Policy Committee, an interagency group es tablished in the 1962 legislation setting up  the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  <OUSTR>. Most trade issues continue to go  through  the  Trade  Policy  Committee,  chaired by the Ambassador-rank Trade Rep resentative. When  agreement  cannot  be  reached on  an  issue  through  the  trade  policy structure, however, and Presidential  determination is required, the issue will go  before  the Cabinet Council on Commerce  and Trade. This council has also commis sioned a study of U.S. competitiveness  in  high technology industries. The remaining  councils are neither as involved in interna tional affairs nor as active overall.  SENIOR INTERAGENCY GROUP ON  INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY  To coordinate  foreign and  international  economic policies, a new Senior Interagency  Group on  International Economic Policy  <SIG-IEP> was set up  in  the summer of  1982. The need for this group was highlight ed by differences over such  issues as the  U.S. embargo of energy-related equipment  to the Soviet Union and frictions with the  European Common Market over exports of  subsidized agricultural products. To ensure  that domestic and  international economic  policies would be fully consistent and inte grated, the President's directive named the  Secretary of the Treasury as chairman of  the SIG-IEP in addition to his role as chair man pro tempore of the Cabinet Council on  Economic Affairs.  As originally proposed by the National Se curity Advisor, the SIG-IEP was to be set  up within the NSC system and chaired by  the Secretary of State with the Secretary of  the Treasury as vice chair. The SIG-IEP  was to funnel information on international  economic policy  issues  from other  inter agency bodies to the NSC, focus government  attention on  important  international eco nomic issues, and monitor the implementa tion of U.S. policies  in  international eco nomic affairs.  As finally set up, in a memo from Presi dent Reagan to the Cabinet of July 23, 1982,  the SIG-IEP took on a somewhat different  role. The objectives set out  in  the Presi dent's memo were to  ""<1> develop, review, and prepare alterna tives and recommendations on international  economic policy issues as they relate to for eign policy,  <2>  develop  a  comprehensive  international economic policy as it relates to  foreign policy, and <3> coordinate the prep arations for international economic summit  conferences.""  The latter objectives are much broader  and seemingly more substantive than those  originally envisioned. In addition, the Secre tary of the Treasury was given the chair manship rather than the Secretary of State,  who is the vice chairman. The SIG-IEP was  also given  the authority  to  form  its own  working group instead of using the existing  NSC structure, and  it established a mid level interagency support group chaired by  the Assistant Secretary of Treasury  for  International Affairs.  Membership of the SIG-IEP includes the  Secretaries  of  State, Agriculture,  Com merce, and Defense; Director of the Office  of Management and Budget; U.S. Trade  Representative; Chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisors; Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency; Assistant to the Presi dent for National Security Affairs; and As sistant to the President for Policy Develop ment; as well as the Secretary of the Treas ury. Other domestic officials with a seeming  interest  in  foreign and  international eco nomic  issues,  such  as  the Secretary  of  Labor, are not members.  In his role as chairman pro tempore of the  Cabinet  Council  on  Economic  Affairs  <CCEA>. the Secretary of the Treasury is to  provide leadership in the debates on inter national issues with major economic policy  implications and, as chairman of SIG-IEP,  to provide  leadership  in  the debates on  international economic  issues with major  foreign policy implications. The CCEA pro vides Treasury with a vehicle for presenting  analysis to the Cabinet, and the SIG-IEP  ",1983
247,Senate,98,-0.347,1135,13,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to bring to the attention of my  colleagues a  joint resolution adopted  by  the Maine Legislature expressing  the need  for  prompt  congressional  action to insure the solvency of the  railroad retirement system.  In 1981, Congress rescued the rail road  retirement  system  from bank ruptcy  by  enacting  a  compromise  funding plan  that was  expected  to  keep the system solvent for the next  10 years. However, the system is near  collapse once again because of the re cession which has caused a sharp, un expected loss of jobs in the railroad in dustry and a drop in payroll tax reve nues during the last 2 years. The prob lem has been exacerbated by the in creased number of claims for railroad  unemployment  benefits,  some  of  which have had to be drawn from the  retirement system.  If Congress does  not  take  remedial  action,  pension  benefits to retirees will be cut 40 per cent this fall and more in the fall of  1984.  Fortunately, rail labor and manage ment have devised a compromise plan  to rescue the retirement system. That  plan, embodied  in H.R. 1646 and S.  1074, would foster solvency by chang ing benefits,  increasing payroll  taxes  and providing  for certain borrowing  provisions.  H.R. 1646 has been reported by the  House Energy and Commerce Commit tee and recently ordered reported by  the House Ways and Means Commit tee. However,  no  action  has  been  taken  in the Senate yet other than  hearings  conducted  by  the Senate  Committee on Labor and Human Re sources.  Mr.  President,  the  leadership  of  both houses of the Maine Legislature  has acknowledged the dependency of  beneficiaries on  the  railroad  retire ment system and the critical need for  corrective action  to stave off bank ruptcy. I commend their expression of  concern  to my  colleagues  in  the  Senate and urge them to act expedi tiously on  the compromise  funding  plan.  Mr. President, I ask that the resolu tion be printed in the RECORD at this  point.  The resolution follows:  JOINT  RESOLUTION  MEMORIALIZING  THE  MAINE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO SUP PORT THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT SOLVENCY  ACT OF 1983  We, your Memorialists,  the Senate and  House of Representatives of  the State of  Maine in the First Regular Session of the  One Hundred  and Eleventh Legislature,  now assembled, most  respectfully present  and petition the Maine Congressional Dele gation as follows:  Whereas, many residents of the State of  Maine are currently engaged in railroad em ployment or have engaged in such employ ment in the past and look to the railroad retirement system to provide benefits when  they retire; and  Whereas, many residents of the State of  Maine  are  currently  receiving  benefits  under the railroad retirement system and  rely on such benefits to a  large extent to  meet the normal costs of living; and  Whereas, any reduction in the amount of  benefits received by beneficiaries under the  railroad  retirement system would have a  drastic affect on the ability of these benefi ciaries to meet normal living expenses; and  Whereas, projections of the financial con dition of  the  railroad  retirement  system  show that unless corrective action is taken,  monthly annuities will have to be reduced  significantly beginning with  the annuity  checks to be sent out October 1, 1983, with  additional reductions required in the future;  and  Whereas, House Resolution  1646,  the  Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983,  was introduced in the United States House  of Representatives on February 24, 1983, by  Mr. Florio; and  Whereas, House Resolution 1646 would re solve the short-term and long-term financial  problems of the railroad retirement system,  through an evenhanded approach of tax in creases on railroad employers and employ ees and adjustments of benefits to current  and future beneficiaries, thereby preserving  and protecting the rights and expectations  of  those currently  receiving benefits and  those who would  receive such benefits  in  the future; now, therefore, be it  Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, re spectfully urge that the members of Con gress  representing  the State  of Maine  should actively support and vote favorably  on House Resolution 1646, the Railroad Re tirement Solvency Act of 1983; and be it fur ther  Resolved: That suitable copies of this res olution be transmitted immediately to the  members of the Maine Congressional Dele gation.e  THE L-REACTOR AT THE SAVANNAH RIVER PLANT, AIKEN, S.C.  e ",1983
248,Senate,98,-0.262,1148,13,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I sin cerely appreciate the leadership's co operation in bringing this measure to  the Senate floor in a  timely fashion.  In Public Law 97-113 the Congresses tablished a process whereby the con tinuation of U.S. military aid to El Sal vador was dependent upon certifica tion by the President every 6 months  that the Government of El Salvador  was making significant progress in sev eral important areas; namely, control  of its security forces, compliance with  internationally  recognized  human  rights,  implementation  of  economic  and political reforms and commitment  to elections,  including good faith ef forts  to  begin  discussions with  all  major political factions which have de clared their willingness to find and im plement an equitable political  solu tion. In addition, in the first certifica tion only, the President was required  to  include a section on the progress  being made  in  the  investigation of  the  murders  of  four  American  churchwomen and  two  land  reform  specialists. Obviously  the Congress  fully expected that these crimes would  be completely investigated and those  responsible brought to justice at the  earliest possible date.  In  retrospect,  Mr. President, we were unduly and un fortunately optimistic. Now, over 2%  years later, as we await the final Presi dential  certification  required  under  Public Law 97-113,  two more Ameri cans have been brutally murdered and  no one has been brought to justice for  these crimes. The bill we are consider ing today, H.R. 1271, seeks to insure  that a report on progress in the inves tigation of the murders of the Ameri cans remains an integral part of the  certification due on July 20. This bill  passed the House by a vote of 416 to 2  on June 7 and was approved yesterday  by the Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee without dissent. Further,  the  Foreign Relations Committee has rec ommended that the certification proc ess,  including permanently this item,  be extended for the fiscal year 1984.  One can easily understand the de spair and frustration of the families of  the murdered Americans. They have  ",1983

252,House,98,-0.473,1213,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Shelby substitute. This is perhaps  the most  important  consumer vote  facing the Members in this session. Ac cording to the recent Lou Harris poll,  the American public strongly supports  the Consumer Product Safety Com mission. In fact, almost half of those  surveyed wanted to strengthen CPSC,  and  an  overwhelming  88  percent  wanted the agency to provide greater  safety for children's toys.  The committee bill, H.R. 2668,  re sponds  to  this  public  demand  for  greater product safety by giving CPSC  adequate funding, staff and authority  to protect the public. The Shelby sub stitute cuts the funding in the commit tee bill by over $60 million. It offers no  protection against further staff cuts,  makes no regulatory reforms, does not  provide greater toy safety and contin ues the gag on the agency when infor mation  is  requested under  the Free dom of Information Act.  The Shelby substitute should be re jected because it is anticonsumer, anti CPSC, and anti-industry.  Let me explain why  I make  this  charge. First,  the Shelby substitute  cuts the funding levels in the commit tee bill by over $60 million. H.R. 2668  adopted a level of funding equivalent  to what the agency had in fiscal year  1981, because that is  the amount of  money the agency needs to protect the  public  against  dangerous  products.  The budget cuts imposed upon CPSC  since fiscal year 1981 have drastically  reduced product safety in the market place. Agency  inspections  have  de creased by 44 percent;  recall checks  are down 64  percent;  investigations  have dropped by 14 percent. The cuts  have also forced the agency to delay  many important safety activities.  For example, CPSC was  forced  to  postpone research needed to upgrade a  30-year-old flammability standard for  wearing apparel because they did not  have the funds  to do  it. Even public  education and  information activities  have  been  severely  curtailed. The  agency had  to decline  invitations  to  make information available about haz ardous products because they did not  have enough funds. They had to shift  their funding 5ack and forth simply to  stay alive.  The Shelby substitute does nothing  to redress  this lack of safety in the  marketplace. It merely perpetuates an  already bad situation.  The Shelby substitute extends  the  agency for 3 years. We have tried to  give it a longer period of time so that  they could make  important manage ment decisions.  The Shelby substitute does not pro tect CPSC from further crippling staff  cuts.  The General Accounting Office re ports that the agency has lost 32 per cent of  its  technical  and  scientific  staff. How can this agency protect the  public if it has lost 32 percent of the  scientific staff to advise  them about  hazards in consumer products? Rather  than replace this lost technical talent,  OMB has proposed even deeper staff  cuts.  Industry recognizes that these staff  cuts mean that CPSC cannot protect  the public from dangerous products.  For example, under the current law,  companies are required  to  tell CPSC  when one  of  their products has  a  defect  which  poses  a  substantial  hazard to the public. This is so CPSC  can work with the industry to develop  a voluntary standard  to correct  the  problem. But  the  reports  to  the  agency have dropped by 52 percent.  Companies  apparently  realize  that  cuts in the agency's field staff make it  unlikely that they will ever find out  about these dangerous products.  The cuts in staff also hurt the indus try. When the good name of a product  is called  into question, we ought  to  have a CPSC that can investigate the  allegations and resolve the issue quick ly and correctly. Denying the agency  adequate  technical  staff prevents  it  from making  these  fast  determina tions. It also increases the possibility  of error, and this ill serves the busi ness community, as well as  the con sumer.  Fourth, the Shelby substitute simply  eliminates many of the rulemaking re forms in H.R. 2668. It strikes the pro vision in H.R. 2668 which allows the  agency to recall dangerously defective  toys.  Under current  law, some manufac turers must advise  the agency when  one of their products  is dangerously  defective. But this provision does not  apply to most toymakers. While great er toy safety is supported by 88 per cent of  the American people,  in  a  recent Lou Harris survey, the Shelby  substitute drops  this provision  that  would lead to greater toy safety.

256,,98,-0.578,1304,13,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  honored and proud to be asked to par ticipate in the Congressional Call to  Conscience Vigil  for Soviet Jewry.  I  also wish to take this opportunity to  express my  thanks  to  the  distin guished gentleman from Colorado, Mr.  WIRTH,  for organizing  this effort  to  comment on  the  flagrant denial of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  June 29, 1983  rights  in  the Soviet  basic  human  Union.  Mr. Speaker, conditions have wors ened  for  those of  the Jewish  faith  living  in  the Soviet Union. Their  rights are becoming more  restricted  and the human damage that accompa nies this denial of freedom intensifies.  Evidence of this hostile environment  for rights and freedoms was brought  to my personal attention by a business  leader from my district whose son vis ited Benjamin  and Tatyana Bogo molny  less  than  2 weeks  ago  in  Moscow.  At the time of the visit, Benjamin  had been hospitalized  for a  serious  stomach ailment directly attributable  to the strain he has experienced over  the past 12 years since first applying  for an emigration visa. Tatyana was  released that same week after a 3-week  stay in Moscow sanitarium for severe  mental depression. She has painfully  shared her husband's disappointments  and turmoil.  Mr. Speaker, Benjamin and Tatyana  Bogomolny  are  young  by Western  standards: they are in their mid-thir ties, but the ravages of Soviet harass ment have aged them. Since their first  application  to  emigrate  they  have  become frail, sick, and distraught.  In the late 1960's Benjamin was con scripted into the Soviet Army while in  computer school. During this time his  sisters and parents were granted a visa  and they now live in Israel. Tatyana's  family was also given permission  to  leave  to go  to  Israel. Shortly after  their  departure, Benjamin was  re leased from the Army and he and Ta tyana were married.  In  1972  they  began their first of over 15 applica tions to emigrate to Israel to be with  their families, all which  resulted  in  cruel denials.  Mr. Speaker, with these denials also  came reprisals affecting the Bogomol nys' capacity to earn a livelihood. The  Soviet Government would not let Ben jamin return to computer school after  his first application to emigrate. He  now earns what he can-between ill nesses and hospitalizations-by doing  odd jobs, working as a handyman. For  the same reasons, Tatyana, trained as  translator, has been officially denied a  permanent job. She, too, finds but epi sodic  employment,  her  professional  training a casualty of her husband's  and her belief in Judaism and their  desire to join their families in Israel.  Some Soviet Jews who are denied  both exit visas and a permanent job  manage to survive on the shared pen sions of friends and relatives. But the  Bogomolnys are not even that fortu nate, Mr. Speaker. The two are alone,  isolated  in a country  that does not  want or need them, yet refuses to un chain them from their unlivable situa tion.  In recent years the KGB has mount ed an active campaign to add to Benjamin and Tatyana's misery. This cam paign has been effective:  the health  and  living conditions of  this couple  have deteriorated painfully. Many let ters and packages sent by their fami lies have, of course, failed  to arrive.  Their apartment has been ransacked  several times, subjecting them to the  theft of their personal possessions in cluding religious books and family pic tures and mementos. The KGB has  also questioned Benjamin for his  in terest in Jewish books and lectures.  Mr. Speaker, the most recent viola tion of these two peoples' privacy took  place in mid-April of this year when  their home was once again broken into  and ramsacked. The result was over whelming:  this was  the  reason  for  which Benjamin had to be hospital ized for 5 weeks and Tatyana lapsed  into a deep mental depression which  led  to  her  being  committed  to  a  Moscow sanitarium for 3 weeks. Mr.  Speaker,  colleagues, what has hap pended to the Bogomolnys is an un equivocal  example  of  the  Soviet's  stepped up campaign to wage psycho logical warfare against Soviet Jews.  On June 6 Soviet officials asserted  that  family  reunification of Soviet  Jews was complete. The Government  declared  that  the vast majority of  Soviet Jews who wished  to emigrate  had already received permission to do  so. I challenge these assertions.  As of June 15, neither Benjamin nor  Tatyana had been given permission to  reunite with relatives in Israel.  I call on my fellow Members of Con gress to continue to speak out against  these violations of human dignity. My  vigil continues until  the persecution  ends. My conscience will not rest until  freedom is granted to the Bogomolnys  and  the  thousands of others denied  rights to their religious beliefs and the  fundamental right to live in the pur suit of happiness.e  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLA TION  INITIATING  HELEN  KELLER DEAF-BLIND AWARE NESS WEEK  HON.

On July 3,  the class of 1973 of  the Glen Cove  High School will gather to celebrate  its 10-year class reunion. I would like  to express my appreciation to Frank  Venturino and John Alexander,  co chairmen of the reunion 1973 commit tee  for making  this  important and  memorable occasion possible.  In light of recent reports of a ""rising  tide of mediocrity""  in public educa tion, it is particularly fitting that the  class of 1973 has reconvened to cele brate and remember the remarkable  educational experience they received.  This occasion serves not only to recog nize the excellent level of instruction  provided by the staff of the Glen Cove  school system, but to reaffirm those  friendships and  ties forged 10 years  ago.  By remembering the special educa tional experience which they were af forded a decade ago, the class of 1973  holds open the possibility that quality  education will once again be restored  in this Nation. The accomplishments  of the graduates of Glen Cove High  School represent an important exam ple for their own children and for the  thousands of future graduates of the  Glen Cove school system.  Let us not forget the importance of  maintaining and rekindling the bonds  of  friendship  which  were  forged  among  the graduates 10  years ago.  Many of the alumni of the class of  1973 have traveled hundreds of miles  to attend this reunion. If this occasion  serves  to  reaffirm  the  cooperative  working spirit embodied in the class of  1973,  the trip will have been worth while.  Mr. Speaker,  I salute  the class of  1973 on this special occasion and wish  them continued happiness and success.  I commend the staff of the Glen Cove  school system which made this collec tive experience possible. And I thank  Mr. Venturino and Mr. Alexander once  again for making this event a reality .e  THE 36TH ANNIVERSARY OF  WKOX  HON.

259,,98,-0.044,1317,13,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, in 1972,  Congress passed title IX of the educa tion amendments prohibiting sex dis crimination  in  education  programs.  Title IX covers virtually all areas of  student life: admissions, financial aid,  academic programs, health  services,  extracurricular activities, testing, and  counseling. Schools at all  levels are  covered from preschools  to graduate  schools. The legislative intent of Con gress was to remedy the gender-based  disparities  in opportunities available  to students. It is a law that has made a  difference. Prior to 1972, females were  reluctant  to enter vocational educa tion programs despite  the fact  that  such training led to high-paying jobs.  By 1980, the percentage of female stu dents in federally funded agriculture,  technical,  trade, and  industrial pro grams had  risen  from 8 percent  in  1972  to  30  percent. The  academic  world has also seen significantly  in creased numbers of women continuing  their  education  and  obtaining  ad vanced  degrees.  In  1980,  women  earned half of all the masters degrees  awarded.  Now  title  IX  is being  threatened.  The scope of its applicability is slowly  being  reduced  and diluted. Though  legislation  interpreting  title  IX  to  mean that compliance can be program  specific has not been reintroduced in  this Congress, there have been several  court rulings narrowing  the applica tion of title IX in the same manner. In  the past 2 years, two courts have inter preted the Supreme Court decision of  1974  involving title IX to mean that  the ban on discrimination applies only  to specific programs in universities re ceiving Federal aid, rather than to the  entire institution if any part of it re",1983

261,House,98,-0.104,1356,13,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the  year you joined the House as a young  Representative  from Massachusetts,  Harry Truman departed  the White  House for his clapboard home in Inde pendence, Mo.  During his 7 years as President, he  concluded  the peace with Germany  and Japan; presided over the transi tion to a peacetime economy, launched  the Marshall plan and the Berlin air lift and initiated the modern struggle  for  guaranteed  civil  rights.  His  achievements, so  long overlooked by  political pundits, could be  listed  in  great detail, but President Truman  would have objected to such elaborate  attention. He was a simple fellow of  few  words,  and  any  commentary  should be fashioned after his model:  short and sweet, and if not sweet, at  least short.  I am delighted by the idea that on  the  lOOth  anniversary of Mr. Tru man's birth the Congress will have a  joint committee-on which you will  sit-to  assist  in  organizing  a  com memorative celebration. Mr. Truman  was no stranger to Maryland. Indeed,  not far from my home in St. Mary's  County is the small island of Jeffer son, where Mr. Truman would convene  with Governor Richie and call to the  poker  table a quorum of  the area's  finest players for the purpose of dem onstrating the random probabilities of  drawing an inside straight. Few in pol itics  could  ever  bluff Maryland's  Albert C. Richie, in a legislature or on  a card table. But President Truman  seldom worried at his game, and it is  said, never bluffed.  Clearly  and  strongly  I  support  House Joint Resolution 126. I encour age any colleague who may consider  these times too tumultuous to permit  such celebration to recall the turbu lent years of the Truman presidency.  We should never be too busy to reflect  on the trials of those who did so much  to open a period in American history  which,  even  as we  speak, may be  facing its most grueling challenge.  e Mr. WON PAT. Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to join my colleague Congress man IKE SKELTON in saluting President  Harry S Truman's lOOth birthday.  I well remember the days of Harry  Truman in the White House. And so  do my fellow Guamanians. He was re sponsible for so much of the gains my  territory made in the early 1950's. It  was Mr. Truman who overrode the op position of the old War Department  and transferred Guam from the De partment of the Navy to the Depart ment of Interior. That single step did  as much as anything to institute civil ian, rather than military, government  for a  territory which had been ruled  by the U.S. Navy since 1898.  Second,  it was President Truman  who supported and later signed legisla tion known as the Guam Organic Act  which granted American citizenship to  the people of my  territory. All  too  often Americans take their citizenship  for granted, not realizing what a cher ished possession  it really  is. We on  Guam do not take our citizenship for  granted. I know what it was like not to  have citizenship and my American citi zenship is one of my most prized pos sessions-thanks in part to the wisdom  and friendship of President Truman.  Obviously, we on Guam remember  Mr. Truman with the fondest memo ries. And we always will. On this occa sion I am honored and proud to join  with my colleagues here  today and  look  toward Heaven  and  say  ""Mr.  President,  happy  lOOth  birthday.""  Thank you.e  ",1983

263,,98,0.422,1434,13,Mr. RUDD.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  the  strength  of America's  free market  system has always been one of our Na tion's greatest assets  in the ongoing  struggle for freedom and democracy in  the world. More recently, the balance  of food power has become a prominent  ingredient in East-West relations and  has brought out a clear ideological dis parity the world cannot ignore.  The proven failure of the Soviet eco nomic system-a centralized, wholly  government-controlled  structure  which offers no private enterprise, no  individual decisionmaking, no  incen tives or profit, no flexibility-cannot  go  unnoticed.  In  the  agricultural  sector,  for  instance,  the  Soviets  employ 26 million workers-or slaves yet still cannot feed their own people.  Our Nation, by contrast, has fewer  than  4 million  farmers who  can  produce twice as much food, and more.  The ultimate irony is that we have to  take measures to slow American agriAs  to prevent over cultural production  supply.  the Soviet Union  relies more  heavily on American grain exports,  the issue of food as a diplomatic tool  becomes increasingly apparent in our  bilateral relations. The significance of  this  issue should not be overlooked  within the debate on overall strategic  balance in the world.  A recent interview published in the  International Wildlife issue for July August 1983, with Lester R. Brown, an  authority on world agriculture and re source matters, provides  insight on  this development. The article, ""Rus sia's Achilles' Heel,"" follows:  RussiA's AcHILLEs' HEEL  <Food is the earth's most critical resource,  and increasingly it is becoming a political  issue. Here, Lester R. Brown, an authority  on world  agriculture  and  renewable  re sources, makes some astonishing observa tions about how American abundance and  Soviet farm problems may lead to easing of  tensions between the super powers. Brown,  a founder of the World-watch Institute, a  Washington-based  think  tank, was  inter viewed  by  International Wildlife  editor  John Strohm.>  Q. Has the balance of food power shifted  decisively between the two superpower?  A. Yes! Last year for the first time U.S.  farmers doubled the grain output of their  Soviet counterpart, 331 million tons to 165.  The Soviets are in deep trouble on the farm  frout.  Q. How bad?  A. Last year the U.S.S.R. imported 45 mil lion tons of grain-more than any country  in history. More  than half of  that came  from North America. As of early 1983, the  Soviets appeared  to be  trying  to  reduce  grain imports from the U.S. to punish the  Reagan  administration  for  its now-aban doned pipeline embargo.  Q. But the Soviets used to export grain.  A. They did until 1970. That year they ex ported 8 million tons; the U.S. exported 38  million tons. But in 1981 U.S. grain exports  had skyrocketed to a staggering 115 million  tons, while the Soviets had to import 34 mil lion tons.  Q. And that's why you believe com, wheat  and soybeans may be as important as nucle ar warheads in dealing with the Soviets?  A.  I believe the shift in the agricultural  power balance in favor of the U.S. provides  an opportunity  to  reshape relations with  the Soviet Union.  Q. What happened? Are the Soviets fail ures as farmers?  A. Not exactly. Much of their land is too  hot, or too cold,  too wet or too .dry. Com  won't mature in the Moscow region which is  as far north as Hudson Bay. But the real  problem  is  that  the Soviet  system  just  doesn't work very well with farming.  Q. What do you mean by that?  A. Farmers' freedom  to make their own  decisions in response to market forces is one  reason U.S. farmers get 16 tons of grain per  ton of fertilizer used. In the Soviet Union,  they get only 6 tons per ton of fertilizer, be cause  it's often used  inefficiently,  if not  wastefully.  Q. Why's that?  A. Farm management which  is made-in Moscow simply can't respond to real needs  of farmers in the field. In agriculture five year plans distort the situation they are in tended to manage.  A.  A.  force  Q. If centralized planning hurts Soviet ag riculture, why is the U.S. plagued by crop  surpluses? Our farms are getting bigger and  bigger, with fewer farmers.  It's not the same. About 2.4 million  farms-mostly  family owned-account  for  cultivation of 350 million acres in the U.S.  The Soviet Union has 20,800 state farms  averaging 13,000 acres each and 26,000 col lectives averaging 9,000 acres each.  Q. Productivity per person must be terri bly low on Soviet farms.  A. True. The Soviet  farm  labor  totals 26 million; the U.S. 3.7 million.  Q. So with only one-seventh the manpow er, American farmers produce twice as much  food?  A. Correct. And this is what worries the  Kremlin. A centralized agricultural system  relying on five-year-plans cannot begin  to  match the flexibility of a system in which  basic decisions are made by individual farm ers.  Q. What can they do about it?  A. I'm afraid that fixing the ills of Soviet  agriculture without reforming  the system  will be like treating the symptoms of an ill ness rather than the cause.  Q. Let's get back to diplomacy. Can Soviet  farm problems be a boon to peace?  Each  day  in  1982  two  20,000-ton  freighters loaded with grain left the U.S. for  the Soviet Union. No other country has  dominated world grain  trade as  the U.S.  does. The Soviets are probably not going to  war against  the country  that has helped  raise the standard of living of the Russian  people while masking failures of their own  system.  Q. What's the significance of all that?  A. This massive new commercial link may  represent the most important change in re lations between the two countries since the  Cold War.  Q. In what way?  A. The Soviets know  they need us  to  produce food for their people to eat. They  may talk belligerently but in effect, we have  become their agricultural partners and I be lieve we  can negotiate political problems  from a position of strength. In  the final  analysis, the long line of grain-laden ships  that links U.S.  farms with Soviet dining  tables may come to dominate overall rela tions.   REMEMBERING BILL MILLER  HON. JOHN J. LaFALCE  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983   ",1983
264,,98,0.262,1447,13,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I  join my colleagues  and  subcommittee  chairman,  Mr.  JoNES, in introducing the Soil Conser vation Act of 1983.  Today we face a nationwide soil ero sion problem which is, at least in part,  the result of outdated Federal farm  policy.  the  1970's, our national  policy was to plow fence row to fence  row  in order to meet both domestic  and international demands for our ag ricultural products. Today we face a  twofold problem as a result.  First of all, as we all know, we have  huge surpluses which continue to de press  agricultural markets.  Second,  much of the soil that farmers plowed  up during  the 1970's to meet rising  demand was highly erosive. In more  conservation-oriented  times,  these  lands would have been left as natural  grass lands and pasture.  The Soil Conservation Act of 1983 is  designed  to  turn millions  of  these  acres of land back to a natural state. A  great deal of our erosion problems  could be solved by returning some 30  million acres now in cropland to grass land.  In my home State of Missouri, 3.1  million acres of farmland, about 8 per cent of our State total, is eroding away  at the rate of 42 tons of soil per acre  per year.  The Soil Conservation Act of 1983  provides  incentives  for  farmers  to  return some of their lands to pasture  and  to continue good crop  rotation  systems. There are mechanisms within  the bill to protect farmers from losing  out when the next land diversion or  PIK  program  is  announced. And,  farmers who cropped highly erodible  land prior to 1982 are grandfathered  so they would not be penalized for fol lowing a Government-encouraged pro gram in the last decade. However, our  ",1983
265,,98,-0.506,1460,13,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, since the Air Canada fire ear lier this month, Americans have been  more aware of the dangers of fire on  aircraft carriers. Recently, the Federal  Aviation  Administration  indicated  that they will be issuing new regula tions requiring a protective coating on  airplane seats to make them more fire retardant.  I  commend  the FAA ac tions, but there is still more that can  be done by individuals and legislators.  I recommend to my colleagues an arti cle in the Christian Science Monitor  by Mr. William N. Plymat. His correla tion between drinking, smoking, and  fires is especially noteworthy.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, June  22, 1983]  How To REDucE FIRE DANGERS ON PLANEs  <By William N. Plymat)  Investigators may finally conclude that an  electrical short and not a carelessly discared  cigarette caused the fire in the Air Canada  jet earlier this month. But still there is a  severe fire danger to the public from the  combination of smoking and drinking on  planes.  In the past few months a number of new  bars have been constructed on concourses at  the Chicago airport and I have observed  many  persons  drinking  before  boarding  planes. It may be true elsewhere. I've seen  such a new bar in the Des Moines airport.  Thus in many cases a drink or two is ob tained before boarding. Then on the plane  first-class passengers get offered free drinks.  Rep. Charles E. Bennett, Democrat of Flori da, has a bill in Congress to ban free drinks  and cigarettes from airplanes <HR 54). Some  years ago there was a limit of ""two drinks.""  Now attendants may refuse drinks only to  person who appear intoxicated.  By  the  time  lunch or dinner  is  served  many passengers have had  four or  five  drinks within an hour. In the air at 35,000  feet cabins are pressurized to an altitude of  6,000 to 8,000 feet and oxygen is limited so it  takes longer to metabolize drinks. Some say  that one drink at such altitude is equal to  two on the ground at 1,000-foot altitude.  A passenger may have drinks before lunch  or dinner and then have a cigarette. The  passenger then goes to the restroom on the  P.lane and remembers that a flight attend ant reminded passengers at the start of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  flight that smoking is not permitted in the  toilet for safety reasons. And so an alcohol impaired passenger looks for a place to drop  his cigarette. And in such a case is very apt  to be careless and drop it in the bin for  waste paper towels.  This danger is further  increased by the  fact that cigarettes contain chemicals put  there to keep them burning until usually  they burn out in an ash tray after about 20  minutes. A bill to stop manufacturers from  doing this is in Congress but appears to be  locked up in a committee. Many wonder if  campaign contributions to committee mem bers from the tobacco industry have had an  influence. In the New York Assembly  re cently such a bill passed by a vote of 123 to  13, in spite of extensive lobbying by tobacco  interests, and it is hoped it will pass in their  Senate.  What should be done?  The government or carriers could ban  smoking and/ or drinking on planes, and air ports could close down their new bars. One  Texas airline bans all smoking on its planes  and seems to be doing well. Carriers could  cut out the free drinks in first class and in  several ways reduce the overall consumption  on the planes.  A special reason for cutting out drinking  on planes is the danger that exists in the  case of crash landings. In such cases every one is supposed to be off the plane in 90 sec onds under Federal Aviation Administration  rules. In the case of a packed plane there is  real danger that an impaired passenger may  move slowly or stumble and block aisles.  Automatic fire extinguishers and smoke  detectors can be placed  in all  toilets on  planes. And new inflammable materials can  be used inside planes. Passengers can reduce  their own personal risk too. They can start  their flights on planes taking off early in  the morning, enabling them in most cases to  reach  their destinations before  the noon  lunch period when drinking usually starts.  Passengers can also advise one airline flying  from St. Louis to Washington to drop its  wine-tasting parties  in flight. The airline  serves three small glasses of different wines  with refills offered to each passenger. And  after that, they can buy drinks.  The public can also advise one carrier that  brags about its new flying cocktail lounges  on its large planes that it does not approve  of this feature. And in some cases it can  elect to travel on Amtrak.  <William N.

PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983  e ",1983
266,,98,-0.435,1460,13,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducting today, along with my col league  from  California,  HowARD  BERMAN, legislation that will authorize  the  Federal Government  to  assist  State and local efforts to aid the inno cent victims of crime.  For many  years  public  concern  about crime translated primarily into  efforts directed at criminals-appreJune 30, 1983  hending them, prosecuting them, and  punishing them. While there was sym pathy and concern for the victims of  crime, for a long time little of a tangi ble nature was done to improve the lot  of crime victims. Indeed, it has been  pointed out that the criminal justice  system actually victimized them again.  This bleak picture began to improve  in recent years. Some 38 States estab lished crime victim compensation pro grams to reimburse victims for out-of pocket expenses incurred as the result  of a physical injury caused by crime.  In addition, in many places through out the country, crime victim assist ance programs have been established  to provide victims with services de signed to offer emotional support and  to insure that victims are treated hu manely.  Some  assistance  programs  focus on particular categories of crime  victims-as is the case with rape crisis  centers and domestic violence  shel ters-and  some  of  them deal with  crime victims generally as is the case  with victim/witness assistance units in  prosecutors' offices.  Last year the President appointed a  Task Force on Victims of Crime to rec ommend steps that could be taken to  insure better treatment for crime vic tims. That task force released its final  report late last year, and I am happy  to note  that it recommended enact ment of Federal legislation along the  lines of the legislation that I am intro ducing today. The legislation will pro vide Federal aid for crime victim com pensation and crime victim assistance  programs and will do so with revenues  from  a  crime victims  fund  that  is  largely raised from criminal wrongdo ers-through criminal  fines,  forfeit ures, and penalty assessment. In addi tion, as suggested by the President's  task force, the excise tax on handgun  transfers will go into the fund.  Mr.  Speaker, my  legislation will  enable the Federal Government to aid  programs  that provide  the  innocent  victims of crime with badly needed  services and assistance. I urge my col leagues to support it.  A section-by-section analysis of the  Victims of Crime Act of 1983 follows:  SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE  VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT OF 1983  TITLE I-CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION  Title I of the legislation authorizes federal  assistance  for crime victim compensation.  Section 101 authorizes the Attorney Gener al  to make grants  to eligible state crime  victim compensation programs. The grant is  for up to 50 percent of the ""covered costs""  (defined in section 103) of compensating the  victims of state crimes, and for 100 percent  of the ""covered costs"" of compensating the  victims of crime that occur within the state  that are subject to exclusive federal jurisdic tion.  Section 102 sets forth the 6 criteria that a  state crime victim compensation program  must meet in order to be eligible for federal  assistance:  ",1983
267,,98,0.336,1486,13,Mr. GOODLING.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  those who say that this administration  has not kept in close contact with the  vocational education community are  wrong. When the administration sub mitted  its original vocational educa tion proposal it was obvious to many  of us  that changes were necessary.  When the President and the Secretary  of Education  resubmitted  their bill  <H.R. 2940) the changes were included.  June 30, 1983  They were asked to include a set-aside  for the handicapped in order to assure  that handicapped  individuals  receive  equal opportunity for participation in  vocational education. They agreed to  this change. They were asked to  in clude an authorization of appropria tions for such sums as may be neces sary rather than the level prescribed  in their budget. They agreed to that  change. They were asked  to  include  more emphasis on sex equity activities,  including  programs  for  displaced  homemakers. They  agreed  to  that  change as well. They also agreed to  permit funding for day care and for  the operation of State and local advi sory councils. The administration has  clearly  shown  that  it  is willing  to  listen to outside advice, and I believe  that H.R.  2940  has  improved as  a  result. Many groups have testified to  this point. It is  time that the truth  comes out.e  JARRETT GOODMAN  HON. LES ASPIN  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983   ",1983
268,,98,-0.32,1486,13,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call your attention to a remark able man who has been of unvaluable  service and inspiration to his commu nity.  Mr.  Jarrett Goodman  of Milton,  Wis., a Vietnam veteran, earned a dis charge  from  the service  in a most  tragic way. He lost part of his right leg  when he stepped on a  landmine. Mr.  Goodman  is  now  employed by  the  Postal Service and delivers mail daily  on a route that spans 60 miles.  Recently, he was honored in Wash ington  as  the U.S. Postal Service's  handicapped employee of  the year.  This award was shared with four other  postal employees. I bring this to your  attention now because Mr. Goodman  is representative of a group of people  who  have not  let  their handicaps  hinder their active lifestyle. With the  help of an artificial leg, Mr. Goodman  still  participates  in  his  favorite  sports-softball,  basketball,  hunting,  and fishing.  It is gratifying to know medicine and  technology today are capable of giving  the support needed to assist the handi capped in carrying on as close  to a  normal lifestyle as possible.  I would like you to join me in honor ing Mr. Goodman not only for his abil ity to overcome his handicap, but for  the inspiration he serves to his com munity and the inspiration he should  be to us an .

271,House,98,0.541,16,18,Mr. BADHAM.," Mr. Speaker, appar ently some of the membership of this  body has not really been paying atten tion in this emotional argument about  nerve gas production, which it is not,  but it is about facilities for the prepa ration in case we might need them.  The United States of America has  pledged itself not to be the first user,  in an international compact of chemi cal warfare weapons. To my knowl edge, the Soviet Union has not only  never signed this but as we know as  fact in the United States, the Soviets  have used chemical warfare weapons  in Afghanistan and in Southeast Asia.  We know what the Soviets are capable  of doing.  The fact of the matter is, again-and  I  stress  this-the Soviet Union has  been in the continuous production of  chemical warfare agents  since 1921,  with no letup, with modernization. In  fact, in the past 14 years since we have  discontinued the production of chemi cal warfare agents, the Soviet Union  has constructed more than 10 facilities  within Warsaw Pact nations for  the  construction and  the production of  chemical warfare agents.  We must send this message to the  Soviet Union that we will not be the  first user of chemical weapons but we  will be prepared because the logic is  determinant  that  the Soviet Union  does use chemcial agents where there  is no fear of retaliation.

273,House,98,0.353,29,18,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 6 minutes.  First, I would like to make a general  statement of how I, at least, plan to  handle the remainder of this bill, and  how I  think the majority wishes  to  handle it as well.  There are two amendments of mine  left, which were made in order by the  Rules Committee. Because  they are  very similar, as they had to be at the  time I was obliged to go to the Rules  Committee to present them, it is my  intention only to ask for a vote on the  first one, which is the amendment now  pending.  My understanding is that the major ity has agreed to this and I hope that  we need not go through the quorum  call procedure, but will move directly  to a vote.  On the second amendment, I should  like to take a modest amount of time  to say something wonderful about it,  but I have agreed not to ask for a re corded vote.  After  that, when  the Committee  rises,  it  is my  intention  to move a  motion to recommit with instructions  to set a ceiling on the expenditures in  this  bill. The  ceiling will  be  the  amount in the budget resolution ap proved by the Congress.  After that, I hope we will have a  vote on final passage and  then the  House may move on to other things.  At least that is the way I hope things  will go.  Mr.  Chairman,  throughout  the  debate on this bill and amendments  thereto, I have complained mightily,  but with a great lack of success, about  the special amount that is created in  this bill. In my judgment it is nothing  more or less the old trust fund which  isolates a particular portion of Gov ernment  revenues.  In  this  case  it  comes from the Customs receipts, for  a particular purpose which may or  may not, relate to these receipts.  Our Federal Government authoriz ing  budgeting  and  appropriations  system should have as few of  these  trust funds or special accounts as pos sible.  What this particular bill does is to  force  the  budget-appropriations-au thorization concept to the outer limits.  It is not, in effect, an entitlement, but  it is an entitlement of the receipts of  the funding available for the purposes  of the bill.  The money is reserved through the  year and,  to be sure, the Appropria tions  Committee must  appropriate  that money before  it can be spent.  But, based on rulings of at least some  courts with repsect to this kind of leg islation, my judgment is that the com mittee may in fact find itself forced le gally into appropriating it, and, if not,  it will certainly have enormous pres sure to make the full appropriations  requested in this bill.  Worst of all,  this trust account, or  this special account, is an open-ended  account. That is, through it we make  available whatever sums may be neces sary to fulfill  the conditions of the  bill.  With  the  addition  of  secondary  workers and with unknown certifica tions under this act which may follow,  nobody knows how much it will cost.  Again, CBO estimated, based on last  year's experience,  that  this bill will  cost $217 million. Labor and OMB are  now estimating, on the basis of new in formation, around $500 million.  As I said yesterday, I hope we will  get new figures that will tell us, with a  little more certainty, what those num bers are.  In any case, this particular amend ment eliminates  the special account  and eliminates all of the entitlement  features.  This means  that,  if my  amendment is passed, this bill will be a  flat out authorization which the Ap propriations  Committee may  then  work its will on, in the best traditions  of the House of Representatives.

274,House,98,0.416,42,18,Mr. SHUSTER.," I thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  this  legislation,  the  rule upon which we are considering  here today,  is the most anticompeti tive, anticonsumer, antienvironmental,  antiagricultural,  antitransportation,  anti-States rights legislation that has  come before this body in many a year.  Frankly, I was astonished yesterday  in the Committee on Rules when testi mony was given before  that distin guished committee by the very distillguished chairman of the Committee  on Interior and Insular Affairs, a man  whom I respect greatly, and for whom  I have tremendous affection, when he  testified that what he wanted was only  1 hour of general debate in this body  on this legislation.  0 1410  At first it seems a bit puzzling, but  then, when we stop and think for a  moment, that is only 1 hour of general  debate on an  issue such as  this  in  which two committees are involved, an  issue in which there are those for it  and against it in the Committee on In terior  and  Insular Affairs,  and  in  which  there  are  those  for  it  and  against it in the Committee on Public  Works and Transportation. And if the  gentleman's wish had prevailed, each  of these conflicting groups and views  would have been given only 15 minutes  in which to deal with the many, many  issues presented with this legislation.  Beyond that, we were informed by  the gentleman from Nebraska <Mr. BE REUTER) and others that beyond the  four different groups and  interests,  there are those from the Upper Plains  States who have views somewhat dif ferent from the four groups that seem  to be taking the lead in the two com mittees on this issue, and the gentle man from Nebraska <Mr. BEREUTER)  and the many Members of Congress  on both sides of the aisle from the  Upper Plains States would have  re ceived virtually no time.  So why the request for only 1 hour  of general debate on  this  complex  issue?  Well, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, as  I  look at  the  tactics being used  in  order  to  ramrod  this  legislation  through this Congress, that there is a  method  and  a  motive,  and  that  method  is  to  slip  this  legislation  through this House as quickly as possi ble so as not to permit the light of day  and the glare of penetrating debate,  fair and open debate on  the many  issues,  to come before this body, be cause  this  legislation  is  enormously  controversial  and  this  legislation  is  enormously complex.  I salute the Rules Committee for, in  their wisdom, not acquiescing to the  request for only 1 hour, by which only  a few minutes would be permitted the  various interested groups, but, rather,  providing for 3 hours to take up this  legislation.  However, once that rule was grant ed, then we were told that the general  debate on  this enormously complex  and  controversial  issue would  take  place  late  this afternoon after  this  rule is agreed to. And, of course, we  know there are not going to be very  many Members here to listen to this  debate this afternoon.  I  am further advised  that  to  the  extent  the debate  is not completed  ",1983
275,House,98,-0.219,55,18,Mr. KAZEN.," I thank the gentleman.  I have heard people say  that we  might consider flying it in if the rail road's rates keep going up, but today  we are more interested in the possibili ty of shipping it by coal slurry pipe line.  This bill would authorize coal slurry  pipelines that are determined to be in  the national interest and required by  the public convenience and necessity  to acquire rights of way over private  lands  by  the  exercise  of  eminent  domain.  Landowners would be fully compen sated and they may move the court ac tions from State to Federal court at  their request.  D 1550  The pipelines will be built under ground to the maximum extent practi cal and installed in such a way as to  minimize  conflict with  the  existing  land use.  Now,  there have been concerns ex pressed about water but I think that  issue has already been taken care of  very, very accurately by my colleague  from Wyoming  in  the provisions he  placed in this bill.  The bill expressly states  that the  power of eminent domain may not be  used to acquire water rights, and that  no applications for pipeline certif ica tion may be submitted until the appli cant has  obtained  the  appropriate  water permit from the State. It also  states that all rights to use water for  coal pipelines must be acquired per suant to the law of the State of origin  of the water, and that nothing in the  legislation will affect the validity of  any State water law.  That means that if a State decides it  does not want  to allocate water for  pipeline use,  the proposed project is  effectively terminated and no certifi cate granting eminent domain can be  issued.  Although I personally consider this  legislation long overdue, I am aware  that the period of time involved has  been helpful in fine-tuning the legisla tion on to the greatest extent possible  in a compromise of this magnitude.  I urge you to support this legisla tion. I believe the rights of the con sumer have been neglected and over looked for too long. We have consid ered every angle and heard from every  interest group while the consumer has  been the captive audience of a captive  shipper on the railroads. I believe our  Nation needs this, and I believe our  economy will benefit by it.  ",1983

I rise to commend this reso lution to my colleagues in the House  for their consideration and support.  I was asked to introduce this legisla tion today to commemorate Saturday's  being  the 121st anniversary of  the  Battle of Antietam. September  17,  1862, was the bloodiest single day in  the costliest and most divisive war in  this Nation's history. While the battle  itself was a tactical draw, its ferocity  removed any hope that the Civil War  could be brought to a quick conclusion  by either side and convinced President  Abraham Lincoln that the time had  come to issue the Emancipation Proc lamation.  That proclamation and the final re moval from our body politic of  the  cancer of slavery was the goal of the  Abolitionist Movement this resolution  is intended to honor.  The Abolitionist Movement arose in  the  first decades of our history as  small groups of men and women came  together to mount a heroic challenge  to  the  then predominant  racist as sumptions of our society. As the move ment grew,  through  the efforts of  such  leaders  as Frederick Douglass  and William Lloyd Garrison it awak ened the Nation's conscience  to  the  evils of slavery and racial prejudice.

284,Senate,98,0.262,94,18,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, it is  with a genuine sense of loss  that I  learned today of the death on Septem ber 9 of a fellow Virginian, Harry R.  Ostrander, at the age of 58. Mr. Os trander had been a member of  the  U.S. Capitol Police Force since July 13,  1973. The last 4 years of his service  was to the Senate as a plainclothes of ficer.  Not only has Harry served the Con gress in su.perlative fashion in carrying  out his shared responsibility of secur ing the Capitol and protecting its oc cupants, but,  indeed,  all Americans  owe a debt of gratitude to Harry for  his outstanding service  in  the U.S.  Army. Prior to retiring from his more  than 30-year career in the Army at the  rank of sergeant major, Harry was  awarded the Bronze Star, the Army  Commendation Medal with one Oak  Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart, also  with an Oak Leaf Cluster, the Combat  Infantry Badge, and the Meritorious  Service Medal.  Fittingly, Mr.  Os trander was interred with full milita,ry  honors on Wednesday, September 14,  at Arlington National Cemetery.  Mr. President, I extend my condo lences  to Mrs. Ostrander  and  to  Harry's five children at this time of  loss. I ask of the Senate that the obit uary which appeared in the Washing ton Post be included in the RECORD.  The obituary follows:  OSTRANDER, HARRY RICHARD  Sgt. Major USA <Ret.>. On September 9,  1983, at Fairfax Hospital, of Alexandria,  Va.,  husband of Adele Cote Ostrander;  father of Deena Pickerel,  Joellyn, Elise,  Lauri and Paula J. Ostrander.

287,,98,0.2,185,18,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  rise today for the purpose of introduc ing a bill which I had sincerely hoped  would never become necessary. It has  been little more than a year since the  Commerce Committee  and  the  nance Committee joined forces to send  the Airport and Airway Improvement  Act of 1982 and its accompanying user f ee tax measures to the Senate. These  pieces of legislation were enacted as  shining examples of the user-fee con cept that this administration has em braced so warmly. They recognized the  pressing need to modernize our airport  and  airways  systems and addressed  that need by taxing the people who  would benefit the most from the mod ernization.  I am here today to tell the Senate  that  the  flying public,  the general  aviation community, cargo operators,  and municipal airports all over  this  country have been betrayed. The ad ministration has  totally and utterly  failed to carry through on the prom ises that it made during the formula tion and enactment of the AIP legisla tion. The aviation taxes, significantly  increased  last year,  are once again  simply flowing  into  the airport and  airway  trust fund and bloating  the  surplus in that account. Because this  money cannot be spent on anything  other than aviation, the surplus ren ders no substantive benefit to anyone.  It only allows the Office of Manage ment and Budget  to show a deficit  number that is artificially low.  To demonstrate in detail how the ad ministration has  turned on the con cept of aviation user fees, a little histo ry is in order. In May and June of last  year,  I chaired a  series of hearings  that built on work begun in 1981 on a  funding program for the national air space  system plan. Those hearings  clearly established the fact that our  current air  traffic control system  is  outdated. If that system is to safely  and efficiently handle  the  large  in creased projected in air traffic for the  coming  years,  an  almost  complete  overhaul was shown to be necessary. A  pressing need also was shown for im provements at our Nation's airports.  To meet these needs, the committee  proposed  an  authorization  schedule  that represented a  total expenditure  of more than $21 billion over a 5-year  span.  Aviation  infrastructure  improve ments have traditionally been funded  by  taxes  levied  on  aviation  users.  These taxes consist primarily of a tax  on fuel used in noncommercial or gen eral aviation, a passenger ticket and  cargo waybill tax, and an excise tax on  aircraft tires and inner tubes. In order  to fund the ambitious modernization  plan, the fuel taxes were increased sig nificantly.  Due in large part to the accumula tion of a  large surplus in the trust  fund,  the aviation user groups were  concerned that their taxes actually be  used  for making  aviation  improve ments. I shared that concern. In order  to make certain that the administra tion was committed to spending this  money, contributed by  the users,  I  closely questioned both FAA Adminis trator Helms and then Secretary of  Transportation Lewis. I made the fol lowing request of those two gentlemen  at our hearings:  ... What I need is a pledge from you, and  from Administrator Helms, that when we  get this legislation in place, the user fees  will be used. And that we are not going to  use them to mount up a surplus in the trust  fund in order to help balance the budget.  . . . They are to be used for the purpose for  which they are intended.  I  received the following replies,  part:  in  Secretary LEw1s. We agree completely.  And if there is any way you can lock us in in  terms of the legislation, we would be pleased  to be locked in so we are obligated, not only  the two of us but whoever our successors  should be.  We  feel  very  strongly  the money  is  needed. We do not see this as a budget bal ancer. And I am sure that Mr. Stockman  will work with us, because he has accepted  the need for the airports. As a matter of  fact, I should point out, at the time I ac cepted the job as Secretary of Transporta tion, I asked the President two questions.  And one was. Was he willing to make a com mitment to the needs of the airspace in the  future? So not only do we have a commit ment from OMB, but also from the Presi dent of the United States.  Mr. HELMs. Senator, I would add on that  just briefly that the Secretary and I recog nized this is a sensitive issue, and he and I  jointly  discussed  this  directly with Mr.  Stockman to ensure that there was no mis understanding.  And Mr.  Stockman  did  pledge to work with us across the board. So  we do not feel we have any qualms at all ....  It was  that specific commitment which  Mr. Stockman made that we would draw  down the surplus and not let it go back up.  Unfortunately,  these  unqualified  promises did not last even a year. In  the 1984 Department of Transporta tion appropriations bill, the adminis tration supported the Senate version  which cut over $500 million from the  authorized levels for fiscal year 1984.  This action is even more incomprehen sible when you examine what happened to one aviation account in par ticular, FAA facilities and equipment.  The  facilities  and  equipment,  or  F&E, account represents spending for  the construction of critical navigation  and air traffic control equipment. The  authorized  level for F&E  in 1984  is  $1.393 billion. The President's budget  for 1984 proposed spending $1 billion.  The administration documented  the  reason for this reduction and pledged  its support for that funding level.  The aviation community, myself in cluded, was very disappointed when  the Senate subcommittee adopted a  figure of $750 million for F&E. Most  believed, however,  that that number  could be increased to a more realistic  level. Those hopes were dashed when  the administration totally reversed its  previous promises of support.  A via ti on users were deserted by the  very  administration  that  promised  little over a year ago to see that their  dedicated taxes would be expeditiously  spent. The  time  is  long  since past  when the administration's plaintive re frain, ""we will spend it next year,"" has  any credibility at all.  I do not believe that the President,  who has championed user fees as an  appropriate and fiscally sound method  of  financing  improvements, has  f o cused on what  is happening  in  the  aviation area. Nothing could be more  alien  to  the President's philosophy  than  to  collect  taxes  for no good  reason. I believe the problem lies with  a Government bureaucracy that still  thinks the aviation trust fund can be  manipulated  to show artificially  low  deficits. Such bureaucratic actions en danger the entire concept of user fees.  More importantly, the sharp reduc tion in aviation spending could endan ger the timetable previously agreed to  for modernizing our air traffic system.  If such delays continue, we will face a  choice between artificially restricting  air traffic or jeopardizing the safety of  millions of air travelers.  Because the stakes are so high, I can  no  longer  rely on quiet persuasion  with colleagues and  the administra tion  officials.  one who  argued  strongly for aviation tax increases, I  feel compelled to acknowledge an un deniable breach of faith by the admin istration and to fight for an immediate  correction. Therefore, I am today in troducing the Aviation Tax Reduction  Act of 1983. The goal of this bill is  very simple. The Government must  either spend  the money  it collects  from the aviation community and mil lions of air travelers or it must reduce  the taxes it levies for aviation.  The bill would adjust aviation taxes  each fiscal year to reflect the appro priated  levels of  spending  for  that  year, starting with the tax levels cur rently in effect. If only half the au thorized total were appropriated, the  tax rates for that year would be half  As  ",1983
288,,98,-0.3,237,18,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker, recently it was brought to my  attention an editorial in the New York  Times criticizing the F / A-18 Hornet.  Several of the opinions contained in  the editorial  in my view were com pletely without justification.  During  the August  district work  period, a  response to the New York  Times editorial appeared in the paper  which  I would  like  to bring  to  the  Members attention so that they can  see the true facts.  The response follows:  [From the New York Times, Aug. 3, 19831  THE CASE FOR THE HORNET  To THE EDITOR: ""When Weapons Flunk,""  an editorial of July 14, based its discussion  of the F/A-18 Hornet airplane on gross and  damaging errors of fact. The opinions ex pressed in the editorial are therefore entire ly without foundation.  It is not true that half the increases in the  cost of the Hornet program is due to ""design  changes and their inflationary costs."" Fully  two-thirds of the program's cost growth has  resulted from inflation pure and simple. Of  the remaining third, most resulted from the  Navy's decision  to buy 1,377 F/A-18's in stead of 811.  It is not true that the F/A-18 program  began <""was  imposed on the Navy by the  Defense Department,"" as you put  it)  in  1970. The Government authorized McDon nell Douglas to proceed with the F/A-18 in  December 1975-a significant date insofar as  it shows the Hornet to be technologically  more up-to-date than aircraft with which it  is sometimes compared.  It is not true that the F/A-18 originally  ""was meant to be a low-cost, low-weight, un complicated fighter."" From  the beginning  the Hornet was intended as both a fighter  and  an  attack  aircraft  superior  to  its  predcessors in performance, reliability and  ease of maintenance.  It is not true that the F/A-18 was ""meant  to replace"" the F-14. The F/A-18 was in tended to replace the F-4 Phantom II and  the A-7 Corsair II attack plane.  It is not true that the F/A-18 has ""rough ly half the range"" of the A-7-or that the  range difference separating the two aircraft  puts the F/A-18 at a disadvantage.  The F/A-18 is not designed to have the  range of  the A-7, which was  a  capable  attack aircraft in its day but in today's envi ronment  is  a  slow,  vulnerable,  obsolete  single-purpose plane. The Hornet can pene trate enemy defenses at speeds 100 to 150  knots higher than the A-7's, deliver its ord nance and then fight its way home more ca pably than any other Navy aircraft. Analy ses  indicate that F / A-18  losses on attack  missions would be less than one-third those  of the Navy's other attack aircraft. This dif ference results from the Hornet's more ad vanced  technology  and  from  its greater  speed and maneuverability.  The factual errors, painful as they are to  the builders of the FI A-18, are probably less  harmful and therefore less unfair than the  editorial's unfounded opinions.  ",1983
289,,98,0.326,263,18,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  has been officially designated as Ana toly Shcharansky Day in New York  State. I join with the people and elect ed officials of New York in marking  this day as an expression of our soli darity with Anatoly Shcharansky  in  his struggle for freedom, and in pro test of the Soviet Government's inhu mane abuse of his basic rights.  Anatoly Shcharansky  is a prisoner  of conscience. He was jailed by Soviet  authorities in 1978 on charges of trea son and anti-Soviet agitation and prop aganda, and was sentenced to 13 years  in labor camp. His only real crime was  expressing his religious and political  beliefs and his desire for freedom. For  this he has been  isolated  in prison,  where his health has deteriorated, and  denied contact with his family.  Mr. Speaker, by shooting down an  unarmed civilian aircraft,  the Soviet  Union  has  brutally  reminded  the  world of their government's disregard  for human life. Now, more than ever,  it is imperative that we remember An atoly Shcharansky,  all Soviet Jews,  and everyone who has been unjustly  denied  their  freedom by  the Soviet  Government.  Today marks  the  exact  halfway  point in Anatoly Shcharansky's prison  sentence. A  sentence  that  should  never have begun at all. Today is a day  for all free people  to call upon the  Soviet leaders to release him, and all  those that he has come to symbolize. I  call on my colleagues and their States  to join New York in remembering Ana toly Shcharansky and working for his  freedom.   24529  WORLD SERIES DRAWS NEAR  HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR.

This outstanding DuBois ball club cap tured  the 1983 Pennsylvania Little  League All-Star title.  This marks  the  third State crown  that the DuBois Little League system  has produced since 1971. This year's  team,  coached by Bill Nesbith and  Ron Maietta, bettered  seven other  Pennsylvania All-Star  teams  to earn  the championship. These 11and 12year olds then went on to defeat New  York's best before losing in 11 innings  to New Jersey in the eastern regionals  for the national championship.  Also, I would like to take this oppor tunity to commend the DuBois com munity on the efforts they put toward  this championship. The friends of the  DuBois All-Stars contributed all  the  funds  necessary  to pay  the  team's  traveling expenses. In addition, busi ness sponsors made it possible for two  local radio stations to bring the play  by play of all eight games  into the  living rooms of hometown fans. Upon  the  team's return home,  they were  greeted by 200 of these fans including  two fire engines which paraded them  through town.  It is my honor, Mr. Speaker, to com mend the town of DuBois and their  Little League All-Stars. They are an  example of the dedication, sportsman ship, and teamwork of which champi ons are made.e  HELPING TO SAVE THE BAHAIS  HON. FORTNEY H.

292,Senate,98,0.068,302,18,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I rise  in  support  of  Senator McCLURE'S  amendment  to  increase  the amount  for the mines and minerals account by  $2,500,000. As the chairman of the In terior Subcommittee has stated, these  funds are for construction or renova tion of a building at the Bureau of  Mines research facility near Bruceton,  Pa.  In the 96th Congress, a bill was en acted  to  allow  the Carnegie-Mellon  University to buy a building from the  Bureau of Mines for $5.4 million. As  part of the transaction, the Bureau of  Mines was promised a new facility out side of Pittsburgh to replace the build ing  to  be  purchased  by Carnegie Mellon. The appropriation was needed  to provide for the new building for the  Bureau  of Mines  before Carnegie Mellon could purchase and occupy the  Bureau of Mines facility. There would  be no cost to the Government because  Carnegie-Mellon would eventually pur chase  the old building  for  the  fair  market value.  Unfortunately, a contract of sale was  not accomplished until May of  this  year. According to the Director of the  Bureau of Mines, Robert C. Herton,  this delay ""was not caused by inaction  on the part of either party, but by the  difficulty  of  establishing  the  fair  market value within  the constraints  and requirements of applicable law.""  In the meantime, the Bureau of Mines  has reassessed its needs and concludes  that only $2,500,000  is  required  to  build a suitable building.  Completion of  this  transaction  is  necessary in order that the University  may continue to expand its research  facilities. I am informed by officials of  the Carnegie-Mellon University  that  they have been striving to purchase  this property for over 26 years and as  you can well  imagine they are most  anxious to have this transaction com pleted as soon as possible. The Sena tor's amendment will help finalize this  action.  I  thank  the distinguished Senator  from Idaho for his assistance in this  matter.  ",1983
293,House,98,-0.318,367,18,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Chairman, I hope  our colleagues will  strongly support  H.R. 3222 which would appropriate  $296 million  for  the Legal Services  Corporation for fiscal year 1984. Now,  more than ever, we cannot afford to  close the doors of justice on the poor  and the unemployed.  Take my home State of Oregon for  example. Legal aid offices  there are  experiencing  a  nearly  threefold  in crease in demand for legal assistance.  The  recession  has  left  a  record  number of Oregonians unemployed.  With  this unemployment has come  more legal troubles, not less.  The results of an undefended legal  proceeding for one who is unemployed  can be  tragic. Homes can be  repos sessed and  life savings  lost  if  legal  advice  is not available  to those who  need it most. If we pass the recom mended funding level of $296 million  for  the Legal Services Corporation,  legal aid of fices in Oregon will be able  to maintain their current level of serv ice, and at least some of these trage dies can be averted.  Both the Courts Subcommittee and  the Appropriations Committee have  recommended providing $296 million  for  the Legal Services Corporation.  This  figure  represents a  slight gain  over last year's funding  level, but it  barely makes up for the drastic loss in  funding LSC experienced 2 years ago.  To put the importance of this $296  million figure into perspective, let me  point out that if we were to approve  funding for LSC at last year's level of  $241 million, three legal aid offices in  Oregon would be forced to close. That  is, 3 offices out of a total of 12.  In Oregon, legal aid offices are usu ally located in small rural communi ties. These  communities  are  often  hardest hit by the recession and have  among the highest rates of unemploy ment in the country. Each legal aid  office in Oregon serves about 10,000 el igible people. Of those 10,000 people  who are eligible approximately one half receive some  type of assistance  from a  legal services program. That  service may include actual handling of  the case,  rendering of advice where  that may be sufficient, or ref erring  the case to another lawyer or agency.  Thus, if we fund legal services at last  year's level of $241 million, 10,000 to  15,000 Oregonians who cannot afford  a traditional attorney will be forced to  go without any legal assistance. Again,  these are the very individuals who are  really suffering the effects of the re cession and  the ones who need our  help the most.  Likewise,  if we approve a  funding  level of only $260 million, two legal aid  offices in my State still will be forced  to close. Ten to twelve staff members  will be laid off and 10,000 needy Or egonians will not receive vital legal as sistance.  With the effects of the recession still  prevelent, now is not the time to be  cutting back  funds  for  a  program  which helps those in our society who  are truly in need of justice. I urge my  collegues to support the $296 million  funding  level  for  the Legal Services  Corporation.   e ",1983
294,House,98,-0.265,367,18,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  am pleased to support H.R. 3222, legis lation making appropriations for the  Departments of Commerce, State, and  Justice, for the Federal judiciary and  for related agencies.  I  am particularly pleased  to note  that the committee has  included  in  the bill $296 million for the activities  of  the Legal Services Corporation,  which provides legal counsel and other  services to low-income individuals who  might not otherwise have the benefit  of legal representation in civil cases.  Since  taking  office,  President  Reagan has sought to abolish this im portant agency by requesting no funds  for the Legal Services Corporation for  fiscal years 1982, 1983, or 1984. The  President's opposition to fair legal rep resentation for the poor led to a 25percent cut in LSC funding in fiscal  year 1982. The fiscal year 1982 fund ing level was continued in fiscal year  1983, and as a  result,  the American  Bar Association  reports  that  local  legal services programs have had  to  reduce client representation by 30 per cent.  I  am pleased  that  the Appropria tions Committee has  recognized  the  need for increased Legal Services Cor poration activities, but even the $55  million  increase  proposed  for  this  fiscal year will leave LSC funding $25  million  below  the  fiscal  year  1981  funding level.  Equal access to justice is fundamen tal to the American legal system; indi viduals should not be denied legal rep resentation  in civil cases because of  their economic status.

296,House,98,0.494,419,18,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. Chairman, when  H.R. 1010,  the Coal Transportation  Act of 1983, was before us in the Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs,  we argued about water.  It then moved over for consideration  by my colleagues who serve on the  Committee  on  Public Works  and  Transportation.  They argued about water.  Today,  it  is on  the  floor of  the  House of Representatives, and we are  going to talk about water some more,  because no one has solved the funda mental problem in this bill.  Congress can write a million words  about the protection of States rights,  but that does not take away from the  fact  that H.R.  1010  is  the biggest  public works authorization in the his tory of the world.  Moses did not try to move this much  water around.  And I would be willing to bet that he  had more water to play with and for  fewer people competing for the bene fits of its use.  We spend billions of dollars in this  country to impound enough water to  call it a lake. From that impoundment,  technology assists us in harnessing the  benefits of that water in increasingly  sophisticated, but benign, ways. We  have utilized rivers and reservoirs to  turn water wheels and  turbines. We  have used water's heat-sink properties  to cool nuclear facilities. We have used  its expansion properties to harness the  strength of  steam. These  impound ments provide water  for  irrigation,  water for recreation, water for commu nities' industry and safe drinking sup plies, and water for wildlife and fisher ies habitat. And as these benefits are  extracted in one community, we have  returned the water to the cycle to be  used  again  and  again  as  it moves  downstream.  The use of water in a coal slurry  pipeline system is a radical departure  from the cycling of water as a renew able resource. The technology of this  energy transportation system requires  that we withdraw massive amounts of  water  from a  river basin or under ground  aquifer  and  transport  that  water  to  the source of  the coal-in  many cases, a distance of many hun dreds of miles.  It is then slurried with ground coal.  Chemists warn us that this process in creases the acidity of the water and in troduces heavy metals, chlorinated hy drocarbons, and other hazardous ma terials.  In this condition, slurried with the  coal, the water then moves several to  many hundreds of miles to the termi nal  customers  of  the  coal  slurry  system.  So what we have  is a  lot of dirty  water transported miles away from its  river basin, and in most cases the coal  slurry customers receiving this water  are  in  the Southern  and Eastern  States where  fairly abundant water  supplies already exist. The newly ar rived water supply from the semiarid  coalfields of the United States is not  needed, nor does it arrive in any condi tion to be safely used.  Congress  tries  in  its  collective  wisdom to determine priorities for best  and highest uses of scarce resources.  In the case of H.R. 1010, Congress is  endorsing a  last and  final use of a  scarce  resource which  violates  the  high priority we have established for  agricultural  production,  community  drinking water, hydropower, wildlife,  and all the other productive reuses of  water as  it flows along a multistate  basin.  I am not suggesting that Congress  bar the use of water for coal slurry  pipelines. I am simply suggesting that  in the minds of many, this is a waste ful and dangerous priority to establish  as a Federal goal for the use of water.  It should be a decision guided solely  by State and  local authorities who  share in the benefits of a water source  and are prepared  to determine  the  extent to which the community can  afford  to have any portion diverted  outside their basin or aquifer.  I would suggest to the sponsors of  this bill that you trust no heavenly  signs that your language protects the  Nation's water resources. It has not  rained in the Midwest for a long time.  0 1650  ",1983
297,House,98,-0.269,419,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I have been listening  as some of our colleagues have been  discussing the current financial well being of our railroads, and their pros pects for the future, given enactment  of  the  legislation  that  is before us  today. And let me say that I am con vinced that we must have a railroad  system  that  is  economically viable.  But  somewhere  along  the  line,  it  seems to me that all of the facts are  not getting out.  Let us  talk about coal production.  According  to  the Department  of  Energy, there were 829 million tons of  coal produced in this country in 1980.  Estimates for 1995 have had this level  going up to 1.5 billion tons. A more  recent national energy transportation  study conducted by the Department  shows that between 1.184 billion and  1.345  billion  tons will be produced  each year by 1990. Why, even the Re publican Study Committee has con cluded that production would hit 1.2  billion tons annually by 1995.  The most conservative estimates for  coal production indicate that we will  see a 370 million ton annual increase  over 1982 production. Even under the  unlikely prospect  that all proposed  U.S. coal pipelines could be built and  operating at 100 percent of their ca pacity by 1995, they would be carrying  only 176 million tons by that date, less  than one-half the additional amounts  of coal that conservative estimates in dicate will be produced at that time.  The 1980 national energy transpor tation study found that only three or  four pipelines were likely to be built,  and would carry only 9 percent of the  amount of coal that will be produced  in 1990 over and above the levels being  conducted currently.  ",1983
298,House,98,0.332,432,18,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today in opposition to the Coal Pipe line Act.  I represent a coal-producing region.  As a matter of fact, it is one of the big gest  coal-producing  districts  in  the  country. And although this bill is in tended to benefit coal, I would like to  tell you why I have decided  to vote  against it and why I would urge my  colleagues to vote against it.  First and foremost,  the coal slurry  bill is not in the best interest of the  American coal industry. It might help  a few, very large coal companies. But  the vast majority of our companies are  small, and not only would not they be  how  this would  helped  by  coal  slurry,  they would  probably be badly hurt by it. Most of  these companies would not ever have  access  to  the pipelines-and even  if  they did, the loss would be prohibitive.  And coal companies left shipping by  rail would  be  forced  into  paying  higher rates.  Let me  explain  happen.  The bill addresses the access ques tion  through  a  system designed  to  guarantee fair access to the pipeline.  Any coal company could apply for cer tification as an original supporter of  the pipeline, which would guarantee  them a certain volume of coal move ment and access to the pipeline. Un fortunately, however, very few small  companies have  the  long-term  con tracts with buyers which would allow  them to become original supporters.  This means that very few small com panies would have convenient access  points. The rest would be forced  to  transport  their coal across  the hills  and hollows-places where  the  rail roads now run but where the pipeline  never would be laid-all the way  to  these  few  access  points. And  they  would probably have to haul their coal  by truck, adding precious dollars onto  their costs.  And even if they could get access,  many smaller companies would  face  serious rate problems when they tried  to use the pipeline. The bill allows for  contracts between the coal companies  and the pipelines. But since the small er companies  rarely have  long-term  sales commitments, they would not be  able  to  enter  into  these  long-term  transportation contracts. Instead, they  would pay on a  tariff basis-and we  would find a repetition of the current  rail situation where we have a  two tiered rate system, with large compa nies paying one rate and the smaller  operators paying a much higher rate.  And of course, without the big com panies defraying  the railroads' over head costs and line maintenance costs,  the smaller companies would be left to  pick up the tab-and this spells out to  even higher rail rates than they face  today. As Department of Transporta tion officials have confirmed in con gressional  hearings,  if  the  pipeline  skims off  the  lucrative coal  traffic,  other users, and that includes smaller  coal operators, would be forced  into  paying higher rates.  So what this bill gives us is a trans portation alternative for the big com panies, but higher transportation costs  for the small companies. In my mind,  Mr. Chairman, this bill is no answer to  our  coal  transportation  problems.  Every year, more and more small coal  companies are forced to shut down. I  am deeply concerned that this bill, by  raising  smaller  companies' shipping  costs, would force even more of them  to fold up.  ",1983
299,House,98,0.017,445,18,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Georgia  for giving me this opportunity to par ticipate in this special order.  I would like to say that I am very  sorry to say that we have to gather  here today for such a sad occasion, but  I think it is important that we pay our  tribute  to our colleague and  friend,  Representative LARRY McDONALD.  I  enjoyed, as  the gentleman  from  New York (Mr. STRATTON) did, serving  with LARRY  on  the Committee  on  Armed Services of the House. He was a  very hard-working and knowledgeable  Member, and when it came to work on  projects for his country and also for  his district, LARRY was always well pre pared, and he got the job done.  Yesterday, I noticed that the Naval  reservists were flying a new DC-9, and  I  remembered that LARRY McDONALD  had introduced an amendment to the  authorization bill about 4 years ago to  give this personnel aircraft that was so  needed to the Navy. It was ironic that  we saw this new aircraft flying yester day  because  of LARRY McDONALD'S  amendment.  Let me say that he stuck to the Con stitution. He believed that this coun try should go by the U.S. Constitution,  and if we would look at his votes over  the years, we would see they support ed what the Constitution spelled out  and what LARRY thought was legal.  As mentioned in this Chamber, he  was very strong against communism,  and he spoke out strongly and often  about the dangers posed by the Soviet  Union and by its client states.  I  think LARRY was driven  in his  strong stand against communism by  his love and respect for the principles  of  freedom and democracy  that we  have in this country.  The message that LARRY worked so  hard to get across will now live forever  by the tragic way  in which he died.  LARRY McDONALD will not be forgot ten.  Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my  thoughts to LARRY'S wife, Kathy, and  his family. He will be missed here in  Congress, and I am glad I have the  chance to serve with him.  ",1983

303,,98,-0.559,471,18,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call to the attention of our col leagues  an  extremely  informative  report on the Puerto Rican economy.  The article, published by the Institute  for Research on  the Economics of  Taxation was written by Dr. Norman  B. Ture, IRET Board Chairman and  former Under Secretary of the U.S.  Treasury Department.  In the article, ""Puerto Rico and Sec tion 936: A Case Study of the Effective  Use of Private Sector Incentives,"" Dr.  Ture describes Puerto Rico's economic  transformation  during  the  past  30  years from being the ""Poorhouse of  the Caribbean"" to the technologically  advanced  industrial  economy  it  is  today. Section 936,  a  carefully de signed and  tested  tax  incentive pro gram targeted to a specific area, sug gests ways of modifying our current  revenue code  to encourage new pro ductive investment in distressed areas  also.  The  economic  milestone  which  Puerto Rico  has  accomplished  and  which Dr. Ture discusses has resulted  from  the application of section 936.  While calling this impressive economic  progress ""a marvelously successful lab oratory demonstration of achievement  relying on  the private  sector,"" Dr.  Ture also cites Puerto Rico's lingering  high levels of unemployment and ex presses the hope that future policy de velopments  seeks  to  fortify  the  achievements of section 936.  I  enter Dr. Ture's article  in  the  RECORD so that we all may better un derstand the importance to the econo my and the people of Puerto Rico of  the section 936 program.  The article follows:  PuERTO RICO AND SECTION 936: A CASE STUDY  OF THE EFFECTIVE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR  INCENTIVES-PART I  For those who have a professional concern  with ensuring expanding opportunities for  rewarding employment, there is no better  setting for sharpening the focus of  those  concerns than Puerto Rico. This beautiful  island has been a laboratory in which it has  been demonstrated how  strong and con structive the response of the private sector  of the economy can be to appropriately de signed tax incentives. There is much for ev eryone  to  learn  from  the experience of  Puerto Rico with respect  to public policy  strategies for economic development initiat ed in the private sector.  Even a quick  tour of San Juan brings  home to one a sense of the vitality of the  people who live and work in Puerto Rico, of  their sense of urgency about progress  in  their economic life. One of the most impres sive  attributes of  that progress  is  that  rather than rejecting or destroying estab lished cultural values, it is built on a foun'.~   EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dation of solid traditions. In contrast with  so many of our mainland cities, San Juan's  urban progress has not been at the cost of  losing the beauty of the past. Old San Juan,  for example, spans  the centuries and re minds one today of the sources of the intel lectual and cultural strength of  the fine  people whose energy  is  transforming  this  land economically.  The statistical  record of  that economic  transformation  is  an  extraordinary  one.  Some of the major accomplishments over  the last three decades may be highlighted  by citing a few of the statistics which de scribe the changes in the amount and com position of employment, output, and income  in Puerto Rico.  Slightly more  than  three decades  ago,  Puerto Rico was one of the poorest lands in  the western world-""The Poorhouse of the  Caribbean."" In a little over thirty years, the  Puerto Rican  economy  has  been  trans  formed from an impoverished, predominant ly agricultural economy to a technologically  advanced, industrial economy. It is difficult  to capture the full import of this transfor mation in simple words and numbers, but  one cannot help but be impressed by them.  Measured in constant (1972) dollars, GNP  increased  from $1.565  billion  in 1950  to  $7 .383 billion in 1980. This is an increase of  372 percent. The percentage increase in real  GNP in the U.S. as a whole was less than  half-176 percent.  Per capita real GNP in Puerto Rico  in creased from $709 to $2,324 or by 228 per cent over  these 30 years.  In  the United  States, as a whole, per capita real GNP rose  from $3,526 to $6,475 or by 84 percent.  The average yearly growth rate of real  GNP in Puerto Rico was 5.3 percent over  the three decades; it was 3.4 percent during  the same period in the U.S. as a whole.  Per capita real GNP increased by 4.0 per cent a year, on the average, in Puerto Rico,  almost twice as fast as the 2.1 percent aver age annual growth in the U.S. as a whole  during these years.  This dramatic growth did not occur as a  result of an explosion in the agricultural  sector of the Island's economy. Quite the  contrary; it came about as a result of a tre mendous shift of employment from agricul ture to other sectors, combined with a huge  increase in labor's productivity.  In 1950, more than a third-36 percent-of  the employed labor force worked in agricul ture; manufacturing employment was 9.3  percent of  total employment,  little more  than the amount of employment in home  needlework, which was 8.6 percent of the  total. In 1980, agricultural employment was  only a fifth of what it had been 30 years  earlier, accounting for only 5.2 percent of  total employment. Manufacturing employ ment has almost tripled in absolute terms,  and more than doubled-to 19 percent-as a  shre of total employment. In the U.S. as a  whole, the number of manufacturing wage  and salary workers increased by one-third  over the three decades; as a fraction of the  total of such employment, manufacturing  employment fell from more than a third in  1950 to 22.4 percent in 1980.  Net income originating in manufacturing  was 14.5 percent of total net income in 1950;  by 1980, this share was 31/4  times the 1950  percentage, accounting for 47.5 percent of  total net income. This experience contrasts  sharply with that of the U.S. as a whole  where income originating in manufacturing  fell by more than a fifth.  This growth in output and income in man ufacturing was not financed by exploiting  24737  labor-by paying workers  less  than  their  contribution to total output and income. On  the contrary,  total  real compensation  in  manufacturing and real compensation per  manufacturing employee soared over  this  30-year period. Total real compensation for  manufacturing employees increased by 740  percent; real compensation per manufactur ing employee was almost  three  times as  much in 1980 as in 1950. Over the period  productivity of workers  in manufacturing  increased by more than 31/2 percent a year,  on the average.  As these data show, the growth in manu facturing  output  and  income was  not  achieved by importing cheap labor, an im portant element in the rapid growth of cer tain European economies. Across the entire  labor  force  spectrum, expanding employ ment has meant expanding the number of  jobs filled by Puerto Ricans, almost one for  one. Even in the most demanding manage ment and technical jobs, over 93 percent of  these positions are filled by Puerto Rican  men and women.  Particularly in the last decade, a very sub stantial share of  the employment growth  has been in high technology industries.  In chemicals and allied products, especial ly pharmaceuticals, almost 9,000  jobs were  added from 1971  to 1981. In nonelectrical  machinery manufacturing, particularly com puters, employment increased almost five fold  in  this period. Over 7,000  jobs were  added in electrical and electronic machin ery,  equipment and  supplies production.  Employment in the manufacture of scientif ic instruments more than doubled.  In the pharmaceutical industry alone, em ployment  gains  have  been  remarkable.  From 1970 to 1980, almost 9,300  jobs were  added, nearly 6,400 of which were produc tion workers. The size of pharmaceutical es tablishments grew, from 20 workers per es tablishment  in 1960  to 143 per establish ment in 1980.  The expansion of employment has not  been confined to manufacturing. Impressive  gains in jobs in trade and services occurred  over  the  three  decades.  one might  expect, this diversification of employment  has been associated with a marked upgrad ing of employment. In just the eight-year  period from 1973 to 1981, white-collar em ployment grew by about 88 thousand jobs,  from 40.2 percent of total employment to  over  47  percent. Within  this  category,  almost 43  thousand of the additional jobs  were in professional and related positions.  The rapid growth in the private sector of  the Puerto Rican economy both gave rise to  increasing demands on the public sector and  provided it with  the financial capacity to  service those demands. In 1950, only 45,000  persons were employed by government in  Puerto Rico. By 1980,  the number had  reached 202,000, almost a quarter of total  employment.  One final observation about this truly re markable record of employment growth and  economic progress is called for. It has not  occurred at the expense of jobs, output, or  income on the U.S. mainland or elsewhere.  As the data shows, the most imDres.sive em ployment gains in the private sector of the  Puerto Rican economy have occurred in the  very same industries which have registered  the most pronounced growth  in  jobs and  output on the mainland.  Moreover, Puerto Rican economic growth  has required increasing imports, principally  from the mainland. In 1980, for example,  Puerto Rican business establishments and  households bought $1.5 billion of goods and  As  ",1983
304,,98,-0.023,484,18,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take a few moments to join my  colleagues in paying tribute to Senator  Henry M. Jackson of Washington. My  expression of sorrow may provide little  consolation to his family so soon after  his passing. But I do hope that they  will come to realize how deeply his loss  has been sustained by the good people  of Washington State,  the Congress,  and the Nation.  Senator Jackson's contributions  to  American history will long be remem bered with admiration and  respect.  During his 42 years in the U.S. Con gress as an elected official, he served  the people of his district, his State,  and his country with dignity. As a dis tinguished state~man, and a leader of  the Democratic Party, his efforts to  address and provide for the needs of  the American people and the security  of this Nation were recognized across  the country and around the world.  It has been a privilege, Mr. Speaker,  for me to serve in the U.S. Congress  with Scoop Jackson.  Indeed, one of  the most special honors which I have  been accorded in 25 years of service in  the House is to have served with him  on the Board of Regents of the Smith sonian Institution, where he had been  a member for 10 years.  While Senator Jackson will long be  remembered  for  his  leadership  in  many other areas of national and local  concern, I will best remember him for  the key roles which he played on the  board in its efforts to expand and pre serve this country's cultural heritage.  As a U.S. Senator, and as a Smithsoni an regent, Scoop Jackson maintained  his moral and professional  integrity,  his devotion to public service, his com mitment to quality education, his love  for his family and for this great coun try.  The  untimely  death  of  Senator  Henry M. Jackson has left a void in  many  lives and  institutions. Yet his  memory will serve as a vivid reminder  of our individual responsibilities to ad vance and defend  those values and  principles which we as Americans most  cherish.   24750  We  in Maryland are very  familiar  with one aspect of Louis Goldstein's  job-and every spring we are reminded  by him on the radio, on television, and  in the news media to get our tax re turns in on time. Not everyone would  like to be the taxman; but not only  does Louis Goldstein do an excellent  job, he does it with a smile and one of  the fastest tax return records in the  United States.  Louis serves as the chief fiscal offi cer. He also serves on the board of  public works, the highest administra tive agency in the State, is a member  of the Governor's cabinet and serves  as chairman of the Maryland Retire ment and Pension Board, chairman of  the board of revenue estimates, and  chairman of the committee to study  the State debt. He is an outstanding  civic leader, as well, and is a member  of numerous historical societies, and  the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  He is also an active conservationist.  But Louis is equally well known na tionally. He has served as a delegate or  alternate to nine Democratic National  Conventions, and was a member of the  platform and resolutions committee in  1964, 1968, 1972, and 1976. He was  president of the National Association  of State Auditors, Comptrollers and  Treasurers in 1969 and is still active in  that organization. He is also a member  of the Maryland Public Finance Asso ciation and Municipal Finance Offi cers Association of United States and  Canada. He has also been honored by  numerous county, State, and national  organizations for his work on issues  ranging from  the U.S. savings bond  campaign  to  preserving Assateague  Island as a national wildlife refuge.  So  it  is  truly appropriate  that we  honor him on his 70th birthday. He  and his wife, Hazel, have contributed  greatly  to our State, both  in  their  public lives and in their private times.  The courtesy and good humor  they  have extended to one and all are re markable in this era of quick tempers,  curt replies, and canned responses.  The Mental Health Association of  Maryland is to be commended in their  choice of honorees. The association is  also worthy of much praise for its tre mendous contribution to our commu nity. The association's service is criti cally important during this era of re duced  public  funding  for mental  health programs. I am sure that this  testimonial dinner will provide a great  boost to the funding of many, much needed programs.  Mr. Speaker, Louis Goldstein has  certainly made an important mark on  the State of Maryland, and, in particu lar, his community of Calvert County.  I know you will be happy to join me in  wishing him all the best in the coming  years.e  September 19, 1983  CLINGING TO THOSE OLD LONGDISTANCE SUBSIDIES  HON.

305,House,98,-0.41,497,18,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr.  Speaker,  while much of the Nation's attention  these last few weeks has been focused  on disasters abroad, our Nation has ex perienced a true catastrophe at home.  I  refer  to  the  unprecedented  drought of 1983, which has created  Dust Bowl conditions in 27 States and  has caused crop production losses of  up to 50 and as much as 80 percent in  many areas. In my own State of Ar kansas, farm crop damage, because of  the drought could exceed $500 million.  For 3 years already, our Nation's  farmers-crippled by debt, suffocated  by surpluses, and faced with a shrink age  of  their markets-have  experi enced the reality of an economic de pression.  In this crisis situation, it is urgent  that we eliminate the delays that have  so of ten  impeded disaster assistance  under the Department of Agriculture's  programs.  Accordingly, tomorrow I will propose  amendments to the continuing appro priations  resolution  for  fiscal  1984  which would establish reasonable time  boundaries for the provision of relief  to afflicted States and counties.  I  invite  the attention of my col leagues to these amendments and to  the  reality of  the emergency which  they underscore.  A government serves the people best  when it acts expeditiously in the peo ple's best interest.

306,House,98,-0.276,497,18,Mr. REID.," Mr.  Speaker,  it  has  become a widely accepted notion that  older people either want to quit work  or do not want to work at all. Yet, in  reality, most senior Americans seek  options  about work. These  options  would help them earn more money or  serve  as  volunteers  or  keep  them  active  in other meaningful and pro ductive ways.  Recently, the Select Committee on  Aging held hearings in my district, Las  Vegas, Nev., not to discuss traditional  issues related to aging, such as social  security,  housing  and  medicare.  .Rather, we  heard  testimony  about  senior employment.  It was more  than educational  to  learn  about  the  enthusiasm  and  energy these forgotten people have. It  was inspirational. We listened to sen iors who represent millions of people  with the ability and energy to make  vital contributions to their communi ties.  But  they  are  discriminated  against because of an arbitrary birth  date, a mere number on a calendar.  The benefits of reintroducing sen iors who want to work into the work place are unlimited. For the country  this senior employment would fortify  the economy and reduce the current  Federal outlay through social security.

That is, shall communities in  which it is routine practice for State  and  local  governments  to  contract  with private companies or organiza tions for certain services, particularly  construction associated with repair or  rehabilitation of public  facilities, be  encouraged to continue their normal  practice of contracting with private  contractors for the provision of serv ices authorized under this bill?  ",1983
309,House,98,-0.517,523,18,Mr. HAWKINS.," Yes,  that  is our  intent and the intent of the bill. By  providing private employment oppor tunities,  the bill increases the likeli hood that unemployed workers have  the chance  for permanent, unsubsi dized employment with private firms,  which the distinguished gentleman al luded  to  in his earlier  remarks.  In  some instances, the cost of the service  or activity determines whether  it  is  performed by private contractors or  public employees. In other cases the  decision is based on the nature of the  activity or on provisions of State law.  In any situation, the committee does  not wish  to disrupt  the established  method  for  determining  how  the  project shall be performed for the pur poses of this measure.  ",1983

311,House,98,0.203,536,18,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to begin my remarks today,  if I can, in a fashion that I  think is  only proper for those of us who have  sat on the Subcommittee on Employ ment Opportunities, which has heard  all the debate regarding this bill. Re gardless whether one is for or against  this particular legislation, and reason able men and women can certainly  differ on this particular issue, I think  we would all be remiss if we did not  give a special debt of gratitude to the  distinguished chairman of our subcom mittee, the gentleman from California  <Mr.  HAWKINS)  and  the  ranking  member, the gentleman from Vermont  <Mr. JEFFORDS) for the long hours that  they have put into this particular leg islation.  As a member of that subcommittee,  I have sat through not hours, but days  and days of hearings on this particular  issue as we have brought in all kinds  of economists and  individuals  from  across  this country to discuss  really  what is going on in America industrial ly and economically and what ought to  be done to deal with this problem.  I would suggest that there is not a  Member among us  that  is not con cerned about  the unemployment  in  this country, and if there is one, they  ought not  to be a Member of  this  Chamber, I say quite simply and quite  frankly; but as we go through all those  hearings and as we have heard the dif ferent testimony that has occurred, I  think it is fair to say that we really  came to two conclusions.  The  first one was brought  forth  most eloquently by that MIT econo mist, Dr. Richard Thurow, who said,  The fact is, we are not in an American eco nomic shutdown, we are in a worldwide eco nomic shutdown.  No longer does the American econo my exist simply by itself, irrelevent or  not affected by what happens world wide, and I could go into the problems  with Japan, England, Germany and all  of our Western  industrialized coun tries, what they are feeling.  The second thing is I think all too  common to all Americans. It has been  brought forward by John Nesbitt in  his book,  ""Megatrons."" It has been  brought  forward by Lane Kirkland,  the head of the AFL-CIO. We are in a  changing industrial base in this coun try. Lane Kirkland of the AFL-CIO  said not too long ago that 25 percent  of the people who are unemployed in  this country will never get their jobs  back, regardless of what happens to  the economy, because unfortunately  that 25 percent has been replaced by  technology.  0 1620  So we need to begin this discussion  today and for the next couple of days  as we debate this legislation, exactly  where are we and where are we trying  to go, and how best can we put togeth er some kind of economic program,  jobs policy, training program, that will  get us where we want to go.  And I think that is how reasonable  men and women can differ on  the  merits or demerits of H.R. 1036 that is  in front of us.  I happen  to believe  this will not  solve  the problem. What my distin guished colleague on the committee,  Mr. OWENS,  just said,  is  just exactly  right, 500,000  jobs with 10.7 million  people unemployed does not solve the  problem. And we ought not try to tell  the American people that it is going  to. Worst of all, we ought not to try to  tell the unemployed that it is going to  do that for them, because too often  the reason that the Congress suffers  credibility in this country is we give  people impressions we are going to do  things we really cannot do or are not  able to do.  We are going to spend $5 billion, $3.5  billion, if the amendment is adopted,  and this combined with a  jobs bill of  $4.6 billion that we passed earlier will  give us an expenditure of about $8 bil lion in this area.  The two of them will employ about  800,000 people in temporary jobs. The  problem  is what do we do with the  other 10 million people unemployed in  this country and what do we do with  the 800,000 people once their year is  up.  It seems to me when we talk about  some kind of an industrial jobs policy  in this country, that there are a couple  of things we need to keep  in mind.  Most important is, as you talk to every  individual  and  every  labor  union,  every unemployment line in this coun try,  they do not want a permanent  public  sector  job. The  fact of  the  matter is most of those people do not  like us in Government very well. What  they want  is  a  permanent private  sector job, and exactly how do we get  that? The way we get that is from  training, and I stand here to tell you I  will vote for more job training funds,  and we are going to in an appropria tion bill later this week appropriate  about $6.4 billion for the Job Training  Partnership Act,  going  to  increase  funding for vocational adult education  to over $800 million. And I think that  kind of funding is going to be absolute ly necessary.  But we need to ask ourselves today  as we debate this bill in general debate  before we get to the amendments, re gardless of the economic policy, and I  think we can debate  that pros and  cons as it is affecting the deficit, but  to  in  terms of putting people back  work in America how do you do it.  First  and  foremost  you  have  to  expend the money on training. The av erage person who graduates from high  school today is going to have four dif ferent careers in their lifetime. We are  going to have to put into place in this  country the most massive adult train ing and  retraining program we  can  ever imagine. And is it going to cost  money? Yes, it is going to cost a lot of  money. It is going to cost the Federal  Government money. We  better  be  ready to pay for that.  In  addition,  beyond  training,  the  second most preferable way  to deal  with people in putting them to work is  in some kind of a public works project  where you have something to show for  it. That is what the $4.6 billion biparti san public works program was  last  spring. That is what the Public Works  and Transportation Committee is call ing for in their $3.6 billion phase II  jobs bill. That ought to be our second  preference.  Only at the end should we look and  even consider something like we are  looking at today which is some type of  tempo'rary assistance with no training  and no future. That my  friends by  itself  is  the greatest disservice, not  service, we can give to 10 to 11 million  unemployed in this country.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983

Much has already been said about  this total act of barbarism on the part  of the Soviet Union, and we are sure  to hear more as the debate on the forinci eign policy  implications of this  dent continues.  It is an essential debate that must be  carried out fully, openly and with dili gence to uncover every detail possible  in an all-out effort  to prevent  this  international atrocity from recurring.  Throughout  this debate, however,  we must never lose sight of the fact  that the central issue is the loss of in nocent, civilian lives. Sixty of these in dividuals were American citizens. I am  sorry to report that one young man  was from my own congressional dis trict,  and  several other  passengers  were  residents of  the State of New  Jersey. I join my colleagues in extend ing my most heartfelt sympathies to  the survivors of all the passengers and  crew members on KAL flight 007.  The resolution passed by this Cham ber last week is an important first step  in expressing our outrage. We owe it  to the victims' families and to the vic tims themselves to remain steadfast in  our determination to make the Soviets  fully accountable for their act of ter rorism.  The tragedy of the downing of KAL  flight 007 will remain with us for a  long time, and that is as it should be.  We must actively search for the truth  surrounding this incident and seek ef fective  international  responses  on  many fronts.  To help guide us in this quest, we  can be inspired by the KAL passengers  and crew members, who will stand for ever as  international symbols of the  humanity we  strive  to protect  in a  world marked by the forces of peace  and reason than by the inhumane ac tions of totalitarian regimes.e  THE  NEED  FOR  PERSONAL  EMERGENCY  RESPONSE  SYS TEMS  FOR  THE  SEVERELY  FUNCTIONALLY IMPAIRED  ",1983
313,Senate,98,-0.266,588,18,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, the  administration has proposed  leasing  up  to 16 billion  tons of coal  in the  United States by 1985, part of a plan  to accelerate energy development on  public lands. In New Mexico, the De partment of the Interior is planning to  lease 3 billion tons of San Juan Basin  coal in the northwestern part of the  State.  Considerable  controversy has  sur rounded this planned leasing program  especially since a  review of the first  major sale  last year  in  the Powder  River basin of Wyoming raised signifi cant problems with the process. This  controversy continues with the recent  Fort Union sale that drew low bids and  few bidders.  The major issue in dispute is in pro viding  an  adequate  return  to  the  public for the release of these public  resources at this time.  Fair market value  for coal  is  the  process by which the Department of  the Interior estimates the value of a  coal lease and/ or assesses whether a  given high bid offered for the lease is  adequate. This is not an easy task, es pecially when coal is sold in a market  that has experienced decades of non competitive  leasing  and  speculation  and where current land use and coal  activity processes may not match the  Government's leasing needs.  The amendment we consider today  will suspend, temporarily, further Fed eral coal  leasing pending  review by  Congress of the recommendations of  the Commission on Fair Market Value  Policy for Federal Coal Leasing, estab lished to review the procedures under  which the program is conducted, espe cially the issue of fair market value.

317,,98,-0.502,679,18,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most troubling issues our society  faces today, and one we will continue  to face, is how to allocate our scarce  medical  resources. Today, we  spend  over 10 percent of our gross national  product on medical and health ex penses. It would not be hard, doctors  and hospital administrators tell us, to  spend 20 percent, 40 percent, or some  other astronomical level. The question  has to be answered, however, on how  much can we afford.  Whether we realize  it or not, that  question-how much resources do we  dedicate to health and medical care-is  being answered every day. The answer  may come on an ad hoc basis, may be  implicit, but it is nonetheless forceful.  If we want to be fair to all citizens, if  we want to have some control over our  expenditures, for health and medical  resources,  then we must  begin  to  answer  the  question  in  a  positive  manner.  Recently, Daniel Callahan addressed  the conference, ""Limited Health Care  Resources: Ethical Implications of Our  Choices,""  sponsored by  the Health  Planning Council for Greater Boston  on May 17, 1983. Dr. Callahan is direc tor and cofounder of  the Hastings  Center  Institute of Society, Ethics,  and the Life Sciences, Hastings-on-the Hudson, NY. As Dr. Callahan states:  ""There does not now exist, nor is there  ever likely to exist, a simple moral for mula that will tell us how to ration re sources        however        we can  morally frame the allocation problems  in a way that will maximize the possi bility of doing the morally best thing.""  I submit the first half of the address  for your consideration:  LIMITED HEALTH CARE RESOURCES: ETHICAL  IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CHOICES  <By Daniel Callahan, Ph.D.)  The topic of my talk is one of the most  difficult of all,  I  think,  in contemporary  medicine, and perhaps in contemporary do mestic policy. In talking about the alloca tion of health resources, we are dealing with  a historically unique human situation. One  can hardly expect to find ready solutions to  a problem of that magnitude, or one so new.  In fact, it is going to take some decades to  work ""things through. I would like to be able  to provide you with some simple solutions,  but I cailnot do that. What I would like to  do, J:lowever, is to giv_e you my own sense of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  how  the subject matter might be under stood. First, I want to give you some sense  of my interpretation of the historical back ground of  the present set of problems.  Second,  I want  to  suggest some general  moral guidelines that I think might be help ful  in trying to understand the problems.  Then, finally, I would like to say something  about how one might apply those guidelines  to a sample of pressing contemporary policy  decisions.  Beginning approximately with the Second  World War, mankind made an enormous  discovery. If enough research money were  spent, and if enough resources were devoted  to medical  care delivery,  the health of  human beings could be radically improved.  Indeed, human illness, which previous gen erations had accepted as a matter of fate,  was now seen to be under potential human  control. I choose the Second World War as  dividing line because it marked that point in  history when the governments of developed  countries, particularly the United States, re alized  that  large economic  investment  in  biomedical research could reap major bene fits. Thus in the years shortly after the war  the National Institutes of Health  in this  country was developed as a major research  agency, with hundreds of millions of dollars  invested each year in support of basic re search and of its clinical applications. Once  it was  realized  that such an  investment  could provide  enormous  social benefits that money could make the difference be tween life and death-it was only a short  step to the development of the Medicare  and Medicaid programs during the sixties,  and to the emergence of a debate over a  right to health care and the desirability of  national health insurance.  The early decades of that development  were marked by hope and optimism. Given  enough  investment of  time, money,  and  energy, no utopian fantasy seemed too out landish. The average human lifespan could  be significantly extended, the number and  quality of children could be controlled, the  ill could be made well, pain and suffering  could be radically reduced, and what had  hitherto seemed out of human control-the  body and  its  limitations-brought within  the framework of human choice and manip ulation. No sooner had biomedical research  conquered one frontier, than another beck oned for attention. The future seemed un limited in its possibilities.  In the moral realm, those were decades of  considerable optimism as well. While our so ciety had always been one dedicated  to  human rights <even if it did not always live  up  to that commitment),  the decades be tween the forties and the eighties opened  up new vistas for the concept of rights. If a  necessary condition for the exercise of all  rights is that of life itself <closely followed  by that of minimally decent health), then it  was only a short step to proposing a whole  new range of what came to be called welfare  rights, and to include among them a right to  health care. Moreover, given the scientific  and medical progress,  it seemed perfectly  feasible to propose such a right. In earlier  times, when medicine  lacked any decisive  power  to save  lives, when nature seemed  beyond human control, it would have made  little sense to talk of a right to health care;  similarly, before it was clearly understood  that many environmental  risks are man made,  it would have made equally poor  sense to talk of a right to a healthy environ ment. In sum, not only could health be im proved and risks reduced, but human beings  could now claim a right to those goods. A  24945  technological and a moral revolution were  thus joined.  Unhappily, as we know, the past few years  have seen a sharp change in mood. While  there still remains considerable zeal and jus tification  for  the  improvement of health  and reduction of risk, a number of impor tant realities have emerged to force a much  more complex, and troubled, understanding  of our present situation and our future pos sibilities.  Three  general  factors  have  emerged to change the perspective and to  move  the discussion  to a different plane.  The  first  factor  is economic,  the second  technological, and the third moral.  The  economic  factor  encompasses  a  number of elements. Even prior  to our  present economic troubles there were some  nagging worries about the possible financial  cost that an all-out effort to guarantee a  right to health care might entail. In medi cine, it has been reluctantly recognized that  the  list of human  evils  that might be  brought under medical superintendence is  almost unlimited, ranging from the ills of  the body through the threats to psychologi cal health posed by life in a complex socie ty. The desire for medical benefits seemed  unlimited, not only in terms of dealing with  present, obvious ills, but potentially by ex tending the net of medicine to capture the  full range of social ills, as well. It was not  impossible to imagine spending the entire  gross national product on the improvement  of health and unhappiness.  In the sixties and the early part of the  seventies, that was an underground worry  only, with only a  few stray voices being  raised to wonder where we were heading.  The major political efforts went toward ex tending  the scope of biomedical research  and the delivery of medical care. Even so, as  the seventies moved along, it became pain fully obvious that the national health bill  was increasing at a rapid rate, far outstrip ping that of inflation in general. Moreover,  an insight of horrendous proportions was  becoming  inescapable-that  the  day  of  cheap technological fixes for human illness  was, with  the conquest of  infectious dis eases, over. Instead, it was becoming obvious  that the future promised to deliver rapidly  escalating costs with increasingly marginal  returns from expenditures. The reason for  that is fairly simple. With the conquest of  the great killers of the young and otherwise  able-influenza,  diphtheria,  dysentery,  yellow fever, smallpox, for example-the re maining diseases, primarily affecting the el derly, came to the fore. Cancer, heart dis ease, and stroke-chronic disease in gener al-have proved to be tough foes, and not  one of them is likely to be amenable to inex pensive solutions. One may grant that the  $1.8 billion expended each year on 20,000 di alysis patients extends their lives, and grant  also  that open heart surgery and heart  transplants, vastly improved neonatal inten sive care units, artificial limbs and joints, all  bring notable health benefits. But the bill  for those benefits is beginning to look astro nomical.  I believe that those problems would have  become manifest even if the prosperity of  the fifties and sixties had continued unabat ed. At some point or other, but perhaps  later than has turned out to be the case, it  would have dawned on everyone that the  maximization of health is a highly expen sive goal. That the economic  times have  turned sour, and that those realities have  been forced upon us in a dramatic way, only  underscores what was an implicity inherent  problem in the first place. The problem is  ",1983

Our country should go to  war when we have to, not just when  we have a chance to.  HAGGERTY & HAGGERTY,  ATTORNEYS AT LAW,  Indianapolis, Ind., August 1, 1983.  Congressman ANDREW JACOBS, Jr.,  House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR ANDY: I have come up with Reagan's  campaign slogan for '84-""He Kept Us Out  of Peace."" This latest foolishness in Central  America reminds us of Mark Twain's warn ing:  ""The  loud  little handful-as usual-will  shout for the war. The pulpit will-warily  and cautiously-object-at first;  the great,  big, dull bulk of  the nation will  rub  its  sleepy eyes and try to make out why there  should be a war, and will say, earnestly and  indignantly, ""It is unjust and dishonorable,  and there is no necessity for it."" Then the  handful will shout louder. A few fair men  on the other side will argue and  reason  against the war with speech and pen, and at  first will have a hearing and be applauded;  but it will not last long; those others will  out shout them, and presently the anti-war  audiences will thin out and lose popularity.  Before long you will see this curious thing:  the speakers stoned from the platform, and  free speech strangled by hordes of furious  men who in their secret hearts are still at  one with those stoned speakers-as earlier but do not dare to say so. And now the  whole nation-pulpit and all-will take up  the war-cry, and shout itself hoarse, and  mob any honest man who ventures to open  his mouth; and presently such mouths will  cease  to open. Next  the  statesmen will  invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon  the nation that is attacked, and every man  will be glad of those conscience-soothing fal sities, and will diligently study them, and  refuse to examine any refutations of them;  and thus he will by and by convince himself  that the war is just, and will thank God for  the better sleep he enjoys after this process  of grotesque self-deception.""

It  is not that GRS is an evil or bad pro gram. This is not a means-tested pro gram, frankly. There are many pro grams that do affect the needy. It is  my view that we ought to be concen trating our resources, if we are going  to be adding any money to bills,  to  programs that help the truly needy.  We all have mayors, we all have  township people who would  like  a  little more money. It comes out rough ly,  in this case, to a  little less than  $5,800 per municipality.  I hope that we reject this amend ment, not because it is not wellmean ing, but because, we must reduce the  deficit rather than add to it.  Second, I hate to think that just be cause there is some room under the  budget resolution, we are going to take  that as a license simply to spend more  than money.

323,,98,-0.322,770,18,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to support  prompt, favorable consideration of leg islation to reauthorize the general rev enue-sharing program. Revenue shar ing is an outstanding example of the  Federal Government's ability to assist  local governments to meet their fiscal  needs.  The unique feature of this program,  as we  in Congress know,  is  that it  allows Federal dollars to flow to local  governments to address their specific  needs. This is an efficient utilization  of Federal funds, because, in contrast  to categorical grant programs, under  the revenue-sharing program, local of ficials have the freedom to apportion  funds to the problems they deem most  pressing.  General revenue sharing was created  by the State and Local Fiscal Assist ance Act of 1972 <Public Law 92-512)  and was subsequently extended for 4  years in 1976 by the State and local  fiscal assistance amendments (Public  Law 94-488). Once again in 1980, with  the enactment of the State and Local  Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments of  1980 (Public Law 96-604), the general  revenue-sharing  program was  reau thorized for 3 more years. However,  authorization  of  this  program will  expire on September 30, 1983, unless it  is reauthorized. I believe the general  revenue-sharing program has been a  tremendously important program pro viding State and  local governments  with valuable general purpose  fiscal  assistance. In fact, passage of revenue  sharing marked a fundamental change  in intergovernmental relations.  Continuation of the general revenue sharing program is extremely impor tant both in terms of fiscal impact and  budgetary planning stability to State  and local governments. According to a  National League of Cities survey, over  40 percent of all small cities now re ceive no other Federal aid, and 80 per cent of cities surveyed said they would  be forced to cut services next year if  the program were reduced or eliminat ed.  In addition, 50 percent of such  small cities said they felt they would  be  forced  to  raise  taxes  if  revenue  sharing is not continued.  The success of the revenue-sharing  program in the State of Arkansas is  widely acclaimed. The total amount of  general  revenue-sharing  program  funds received by all municipalities in  the State of Arkansas was $43,441,575  in fiscal year 1982, and will be approxi mately $46,413,653 in fiscal year 1983,  if the program is reauthorized.  Mr. President, I have been a consist ent supporter of the revenue-sharing  program and I strongly support con tinuation of the program.  It is important, Mr. President, that  the Senate act expeditiously  in this  matter. Local officials are  trying  to  plan their budgets for fiscal year 1984  and beyond. We,  in Congress,  can  make  their  jobs more  rational  by  quickly approving a bill, so that they  will know what kind of Federal assist ance their jurisdiction can expect.  This program deserves strong con gressional support, both for now and  in the future. The funds provided to  local governments through the reve nue-sharing program are used for a va riety of important projects, from the  creation of jobs to the rebuilding of  local infrastructures. Mr. President, I  am told by local officials that this is  the one program that affords  them  the flexibility to actually target Feder al funds to specific local needs. Such a  program,  in  light of  the  financial  strains of local governments, is sorely  needed.  ",1983

During the August recess, I had  the opportunity to meet with numer ous local officials in Tennessee. From  Mountain City to Memphis, they all  voiced  their strong support for con tinuation of this important program of  aid to local governments.  There is just no question that this  program is viewed positively, both by  our Nation's local officials and from  the Washington perspective. Officials  of local communities like the program  because  they can decide where and  how the money is to be spent. We here  in Washington are impressed with this  program, too, because it is so efficient.  Less than 1 percent of revenue-sharing  funds go for overhead and administra tive costs. That means that the great est possible proportion of the money is  targeted by local government officials  toward areas of greatest need.  Since  the general  revenue sharing  program began in 1972, Tennessee has  received more than $1 billion from the  program. Local officials  in my State  have used these funds wisely to pro vide a wide variety of essential services  including police and fire protection,  highway maintenance, and education.  A  sampling of projects  funded  in  middle Tennessee,  for  example,  in cludes: the purchase of an ambulance,  the placement of street and  traffic  lights, improvements to police and fire  facilities, and expenditures for librar ies.  Many of  these  local governments  would be forced to either raise taxes  or cut services  if revenue sharing is  not made available.  One Tennessee government, for ex ample, the city of Chattanooga, allots  $2.6 million of their annual $3.8 mil lion annual revenue sharing funding  for use in the operating budget. The  rest goes  to vital capital projects. If  revenue-sharing funds were not avail able  to Chattanooga,  then  it would  take a 32-cent increase in the property  tax to replace it. Or services to Chat tanoogans would have to be cut in pro portion to the funding reduction.  The  town of Murfreesboro, Tenn.,  would face a 45-cent increase in prop erty taxes without revenue sharing.  Shelbyville, Tenn., would have  to  raise the property tax rate 50  to 60  cents if revenue sharing is not made  available.  Revenue sharing is especially impor tant to these-and other-local com munities in my State because of the  tax base which is limited by the per manent restraints of the State consti tution. The same situation exists  in  many other States. We have a respon sibility to all of the 39,000 local gov ernments across this country to con tinue to fund revenue sharing to help  them provide public services  to our  mutual constituents.  We must act quickly on the renewal  of  this vital program. Already,  the  delay  in  reauthorization has caused  undue complications  in the prepara tion of municipal and county budgets.  Most of these budgets had to be com plete by July 1. Revenue-sharing allo cations could not be assumed for this  deadline because Congress has not yet  acted to renew the program.  I  support  Senator  MOYNIHAN's  amendment to increase revenue-shar ing funding by $450 million annually.  Adjusting the program upward makes  partial amends for the erosion of the  program by the effects of inflation.  However,  I do not favor modifica tions in the revenue-sharing formula  that would be  triggered by any  in creases in funding under the current  provisions of S. 1426. These formula  changes would mean that only about  half of the local governments now re ceiving revenue sharing would be eligi ble  to share in the $450 million  in crease.  That hardly seems fair. All local gov ernments are now experiencing finan cial stress due to inflation and the re cession. That  is why I also support  Senator LONG'S amendment to delete  these formal modifications.  With  these changes  in S. 1426,  I  wholeheartedly support this renewal. I  encourage rapid action on this legisla tion.  ",1983

326,Senate,98,-0.163,783,18,Mr. BENTSEN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation pro viding for the payment of benefits to  survivors of  retired missing Federal  employees or Members of Congress.  Under current law, the Office of Per sonnel Management does not have the  authority to pay a missing retiree's an nuity to the surviving spouse. Further,  the OPM cannot begin payment of  survivor benefits in a case where a re tiree is presumed missing but not offi cially declared dead. My bill is intend ed to rectify this situation.  This discrepancy  in  the  law was  brought to my attention by one of my  constituents, the wife of the Federal  retiree missing since October 1980. My  constituent's husband, along with a  U.S. Army officer, vanished on a flight  from Spain to Germany. Upon learn ing of the retiree's disappearance, the  OPM suspended his monthly annuity  check. However, in the absence of any  official determination of death,  the  OPM did not commence payment of  survivor benefits  to his widow.  In  short, he was dead enough for  the  OPM to terminate his pension, but not  dead enough to allow payment of sur vivor benefits to my constituent.  Because  a  civil  service  annuity  earned by an individual is for his own  use and  is not considered  to be a  family benefit, it cannot be claimed by  living  dependents.  In  addition,  the  OPM cannot make a determination of  death, and requires a death certificate  in order to commence payment of sur vivor benefits. In this particular case,  the required certificate of death was  to be provided by the Spanish Govern ment, which concluded that there was  insufficient  evidence  to  presume  death.  By contrast, existing law permits a  Government agency to make an offi cial finding of death in the case of a  missing Federal civilian employee or  active duty member of a uniformed  service. The Army officer accompany ing my constituent's husband was offi cially determined dead by the Depart ment of the Army based upon the cir cumstances surrounding the officer's  disappearance. Although  these  facts  were identical to those of the missing  Federal retiree,  the information was  insufficient for the OPM.  Upon learning of the incident, I re quested the Government Accounting  Office to investigate this discrepancy  which allowed the Department of the  Army  greater  discretion  than  the  OPM. The GAO determined that cur rently there is neither statutory nor  regulatory  authority  for  a Govern ment agency to make an official find ing of death in the case of missing  Federal  retirees. The GAO  recom mended  that statutory authority be  given to the OPM to declare the miss ing person dead and extend protection  to the annuitant's dependents.  The OPM concurred with the GAO  that statutory authority is needed to  resolve this problem and to give the  OPM the necessary mandate. There fore,  I  am  introducing  legislation  which would allow a survivor benefit  to be paid to any individual who would  otherwise be entitled to an annuity in  the event of the death of a retired em ployee. If a missing retiree does not re appear and claim his benefits within 6  months of the date the Office deter mined him to be missing, the OPM is  authorized to commence payment of  survivor benefits.  We need a consistent Government  policy to protect the rights of depend ents of our civil service retirees. For 3  years, my constituent has been unable  to  receive  the  survivor benefits  to  which she is entitled. I hope that the  appropriate committees will act swift ly to rectify this situation.

328,House,98,-0.45,809,18,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, the House  appears ready to give its approval for  American troops to remain in Lebanon  for an additional 18 months, and I be lieve that is a mistake.  I have always believed that in the  context of an overall settlement in the  Middle East, we would have to be pre pared to send American troops as part  of an international peacekeeping force  if we were requested to do so by all  parties to the settlement. But it seems  to me that in this situation it is simply  wrong  to provide authority  for our  troops to remain there for 18 months.  I  think 18 months  is  too  long. We  should not be in a position where we  appear to be fighting on one side of an  age-old conflict.  Mr. Speaker, I would support, for in stance, giving  the administration 60  days to report under the War Powers  Act, but after that I believe that the  war powers clock ought to tick and the  Congress ought to make a judgment at  that time about what further steps are  necessary.

329,House,98,-0.355,809,18,Mr. RATCHFORD.," Mr. Speaker, as  we begin debate on education appro priations this week, I hope we all will  keep in mind the importance of financial aid for  lowand middle-income  students and families.  Since the administration took office,  about 1 million students have been cut  off  from Federal student aid. That  number would be even higher had we  not restored many of the deep cuts  proposed by the administration.  For the coming fiscal year, the Ap propriations Committee has developed  a good bill with a responsible student  aid package. Pell grants and student  loans are kept intact. Work study is in creased from the current year, and the  other  campus-based  programs  are  saved from the administration's plan  to terminate them.  This bill will be good for students  and families in Connecticut, certainly  better than the program we received  in February. I urge my colleagues to  support this vital appropriations bill.

330,House,98,-0.172,809,18,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, yester day the House Armed Services Com mittee approved  legislation based  in  part on a proposal that I introduced to  reform the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the  U.S. military's top command level. The  committee bill, H.R. 3718, which was  approved  unanimously,  is  based  in  part on the bill, H.R. 2560, that I in troduced.  While the committee bill is not as  comprehensive  as  the one  I  intro duced, it is certainly a major step for ward. Certain provisions were adopted  from my legislation. First, the chain of  command from the President on down  through the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  is  established;  strengthening  the  position  of  the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff;  designating the Chairman as an advis er to the President and the Secretary  of Defense in his own right; providing  for military representation on the Na tional Security Council, which has not  happended before; and insuring that  the Joint Chiefs of Staff attract the  most  qualified  officers  in  all  the  branches of the service; and it provides  for proper promotion within that spec trum.  I  am pleased  to  say  that  these  changes  are  a  step  forward.

331,House,98,-0.362,822,18,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the substitute.  With all due respect to the gentle man from California, and I know he  has spent a  substantial amount of  time  in working on  this  legislation,  and, as I said at the outset, I support  the legislation, I will be voting for it  and  I hope  that what  I  am about  today is viewed as constructive, but I  must rise in opposition to the substi tute amendment for the following rea sons:  In the first  instance, here we are  talking about paying administrators  comparable  salaries  for what  they  presently do if they are administrators  under this act, and yet what we are  creating under this act is a new ap proach, a new program.  So, trying to define what a compara ble function and comparable salary is,  I think is going to be somewhat diffi cult because we are dealing with a  unique creation here in the legislation.  Second, I find some difficulty with  the words ""comparable functions."" In  all due respect, I have to say that with  the words  ""comparable  functions,""  ""comparable  levels of pay,"" we  are  completely surrendering to the State,  local, municipal, and county govern ments the authority to set whatever  pay they want to set for administra tors.  That, in my mind, goes far beyond,  of course,  the intent of my original  amendment and in fact it violates the  very reason it was offered.  When we leave it up to the locals, I  think we look beyond one very impor tant fact. For the men and women  presently unemployed we are going to  bring under this program and ask to  participate, we are going  to provide  them only $230 a week  in most  in stances.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House,  that amount of money  is not some  princely sum that a person would want  to find as a full-time salary and look  forward to retirement. It is an emer gency  measure. We  are  bringing  people in to give them something to do  worthwhile in the community and pay  them a decent wage, not a generous  wage, but a decent wage.  We are asking sacrifice from the par ticipants, yet I cannot understand the  reluctance today from those who are  sponsoring and pushing forward this  legislation to ask this same degree of  sacrifice from administrators.  D 1200  Twenty-nine  thousand dollars does  not, to me, appear to be the kind of  sum that we have to apologize for. In  fact,  I  think it is a  fair amount of  money to pay to a person who is super vising employees who make $11,000.  With  this amendment, we  remove  the cap entirely. If the local unit of  government should certify that they  pay their administrators in like func tions $60,000 per year,  that is what  they will be paid,  I  guess, because  under the substitute amendment, that  authority is given to them.  I do not understand the reluctance  to ask for sacrifice when it comes to  administrative salaries when we have  so many administrative people, white collar workers, who are out of work  today.  Let me clarify one final point which  has been brought out several  times:  What I am about with my original  amendment would not reduce anyone's  existing  salary.  If an employee  for  Government has a  job today and is  paid an amount of money to work that  job and is asked by his administrator  to keep an eye on this program, there  is nothing, absolutely nothing,  that  would reduce their salary until such  time as that administrator seeks Fed eral funds for reimbursement.  If the person, the administrator with  the present job, the deputy mayor or  whatever, takes on that responsibility  and is not paid with Federal funds,  that person can be paid whatever the  unit  of  local  government,  city,  or  whatever, cares to.

The amendment basically does not  impact  on  the  cities,  counties,  et  cetera, above 50,000, but only impacts  on the balance of State funds that go  to the State, and under the amend ment will still go to the State, but it  makes a determination as to allocation  of the funds, rather than going to the  State and letting the State disperse  them as it sees fit.  It provides that the funds should be  distributed in the formula used in the  bill for the eligible entities, the larger  cities. In other words, it would mean  that the funds going to the State will  actually go to the higher unemployed  rural counties, rather than be distrib uted willy-nilly by the Governor of the  State.  And I believe that it means that the  funds that are going to the balance of  the State for the rural counties will go  to those rural counties who pave high  unemployment  just as  if  the other  funds would go to the major cities and  metropolitan areas with high unem ployment.

337,House,98,-0.081,861,18,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Chairman,  in  order to  insure  the  integrity of the  Community Renewal Act. special ef forts are necessary to prevent fraud  and other abuses. Strong enforcement  provisions were taken under CETA in  order to insure that employment and  training opportunities are provided on  an equitable basis. In its brief history,  from 1973 to 1982, CETA was amended  8  times and proliferated 12 separate  programmatic  titles, parts, and sub parts. The constant legislative changes  helped strengthen the bill by providing equal employment and training op portunities to all Americans.  However, in any jobs program, there  is  the  danger  of  political  abuses.  Under CETA in fiscal year 1980 an  amendment was enacted into law  to  prevent nepotism, and other discrimi natory hiring practices. This amend ment had the effect of insuring non discrimination and he1ped foster equal  opportunity. To help strengthen the  Community Renewal Act, I am offer ing an enforcement provision to assure  against program abuses, including, but  not limited to nepotism and political  patronage.  In my congressional district, there is  an average unemployment rate of 16.4  percent which  is well above the na tional average. Many of these individ uals are long-term unemployed-many  for 15 weeks or more.  This bill is specifically targeted for  our  long-term unemployed,  and we  want  to make every assurance  that  these  funds  reach  those Americans  who are most devastated by the reces sion. Therefore, the tough, antinepo tism provision  is designed  to  insure  that the funds under the Community  Renewal Employment Act will be used  for the primary purpose of providing  temporary  jobs  to  those  in greatest  need-the long-term unemployed.

In addition to my feelings  of outrage about this terrible action, I  could also feel the personal pain and  anguish of the Cruz and Bolante fami lies.

341,,98,-0.339,926,18,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, all of  those of us who live in the archdiocese  of New Yq_rk are saddened by the news  that our spiritual leader Terence Car dinal Cooke is terminally ill with leu kemia. This sadness goes far beyond  the parameters of the archdiocese and  is  shared by Pope John Paul and  President Reagan-each of whom com municated their sentiments to Cardi nal Cooke.  Since  1968,  Cardinal Cooke  has  served as the leader of the archdiocese  of New York which has some 1.8 mil lion Roman Catholics. Further Cardi nal Cooke also serves as our Nation's  Roman Catholic military vicar.  Terence Cardinal Cooke has been a  priest since his ordination on Decem ber 1, 1945. He taught at both Catho lic and Fordham Universities and by  the year 1957 he was named as person al secretary to his predecessor Cardi nal Spellman. By 1965 he was ordained  as an auxiliary bishop.  He was  installed as archbishop of  New York on April 4, 1968, with Presi dent Lyndon B. Johnson  in attend ance. Cardinal Cooke has counseled all  of  the President's who have served  during his years as archbishop and has  been especially close to both President  and Mrs. Reagan.  Terence Cardinal Cooke is a native  New Yorker having been born on the  upper West Side of Manhattan. He  knows New York as well as anyone  having visited its neighborhoods and  seen its people for many years. At one  time in 1945 Cardinal Cooke was as signed as assistant pastor at St. AthanEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  asius Church in the Bronx. Cardinal  Cooke despite his national and inter national prominence and position has  always felt most comfortable in New  York.  Cardinal Cooke  is viewed by those  who have known him as a patient,  compassionate, and highly intelligent  man more content with being in the  role of a pastor than a church admin istrator.  I have  the personal honor  and privilege to have known Cardinal  Cooke for many years found his coun sel invaluable to me personally. One of  the proudest pictures  I have  in my  office  is with Cardinal Cooke  and  former President Gerald R. Ford at  the annual Al Smith dinner in New  York City.  Cardinal Cooke once said his main  goal was  to be a  ""good priest."" He  gained a reputation over these past 15  years as a master conciliator. He has  also maintained a remarkably close re lationship  to  the  individual  people  who make up his massive archdiocese.  He has been one of the most accessible  and visible of all cardinals  in  this  Nation. This tradition of maintaining  close touch with people also has car ried into his work in the archdiocese.  Few positions which Cardinal Cooke  has taken over the years have come  without  the benefit of consultation  with  individual  priests  and pastors  from within the archdiocese.  It is impossible to predict how much  longer Cardinal Cooke will live. He has  been administered with last rites by  the church. His spokesman has said  that the cardinal is taking the news  ""with faith and peace of soul."" He is  continuing to work and attend to his  responsibilities.  The people of New York have been  blessed by Cardinal Cooke through his  work. There are few people who have  given so much of themselves for their  fellow man  than Cardinal Cooke.  Whether he provided counsel or solace  to an individual parishioner or to a  fighting man overseas or to a Chief  Executive, Cardinal Cooke was a man  of  commitment  and  compassion.  I  have had the distinct honor of being  in the company of Cardinal Cooke on  numerous occasions. I have been en riched as a person because of having  known this man. There are few people  who will be missed more than Cardinal  Cooke.  It has been said that death, like life,  is a gift of God. Cardinal Cooke's life  was a gift to the millions who know  him and join with me in praying that  the cardinal live his remaining days in  peace and without suff ering.e  September 21, 1983  THE 200TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRA TION OF THE TOWN OF CHES TER, MASS.

344,Senate,98,0.342,1056,18,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  strongly support Senator KAssEBAUM's  amendment  to  reduce 1984  funding  earmarked for certain U.N. funding to  the 1980 level of funding, with further  decreases in the next 3 years.  The Secretary-General of the United  Nations  in his  latest  report admits  that there has often been very poor  oversight of spending in the many pro grams of that organization. There has  often been, the report suggests, an in adequate control of spending on many  levels. It appears that there exist few  safeguards against poor fiscal manage ment in the United Nations.  It is often not publicized that sala ries and benefits of U.N. employees  dwarf United States and international  earnings averages. Additionally,  few  questions are asked about the costs of  U.N.  programs  and whether  those  costs produce  the promised  results.  This amendment causes us  to  face  squarely the fact that funds now paid  to the United Nations could more ef fectively  and humanely be utilized  elsewhere. By reducing the 1984 fund ing to 1980 levels and further reducing  that figure by 10 percent each year for  3  years,  the United States would  retain several hundred million dollars.  That amount of savings is not insub stantial and could be valuably applied  in any number of areas, including use  in domestic programs and reduction of  the Federal deficit.  This amendment does not put our  position in the United Nations in jeop ardy as has been charged. The reduced  payments would be designated as pay ments in full, thus avoiding the possi bility of fines by the United Nations  for averages. In our Federal budget we  face  the necessity of spending con trols. If the United States is to provide  a large portion of U .N. funds, that or ganization must tighten its spending  also.e  ",1983

By accepting the legislation that has  already been passed by the Senate, I  believe we can dispose of what has  been a very controversial issue while  at the same time insuring that virtual ly all Members of the House will be  able to support the bill.  I think all of us want to be united in  the foreign policy initiatives which are  involved. Yet, at the same  time, we  wish to insure protection for those in  our own country who have legitimate  broadcasting interests.

350,,98,-0.298,1277,18,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker,  this  past weekend,  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Salk.in of Temple Judea  in Doyles town, Pa., discussed with his congrega tion at Yom Kippur services the plight  of Soviet Jewry in very vivid  terms.  Rabbi Salkin's message serves as a re minder to us that we must continue to  do all we can  to help Soviet Jews  pursue their dream of religious free dom.  The text follows:  ENCOUNTERS WITH THE JEWS OF SILENCE  <Sermon delivered by Rabbi Jeffrey K.  Salkin)  Why did  I choose  to go  to  the Soviet  Union this past June? What draws an Amer ican Jew and a rabbi to Russia?  I believe that I went to the Soviet Union  as a partial atonement for the sin of having  heard the cries of my brothers and sisters,  but having done little to respond to their  cries. I had been burnt-out on the topic of  Soviet Jewry. Indeed, I had signed the peti tions and attended the rallies and the pa rades that plead for the release of our fet tered people who  languish  in  the prison  that is the Soviet Union. But that was all.  For me, it remained a distant concern-one  more episode of persecution to fit into the  web of Jewish history.  Until this trip to the Soviet Union, I was a  vicarious spectator to their turmoil. Truly,  there is nothing like real experience to help  us understand the situation as it exists, to  help us visualize what Russian  Jews go  through every day of their lives.  That is why I went into the trenches of  Jewish identity. For that is what the Soviet  Union is. It is the home of what may be the  bravest Jews in the world. It is where the  spiritual blood of Jewry is both shed-and  replenished all the time.  And it is only there that one can learn the  true depth of the situation. Since my return  I have been asked by many people: ""Is it  really as bad as  they say it is for Soviet  Jews?"" The question is well-meaning. It is  being asked by Jews who are probably as  bored as I used to be of the whole issue.  I must tell you that the answer to that  question is: Yes. Yes, the situation is as bad  as they say. It is worse than they say. And  there was not a single Jew with whom I  spoke-and we met with perhaps thirty re fuseniks  in a variety of settings-who did  not emphasize their dark fear that the situ ation is going to continue getting more de sparate. For these Jews who so desperately  want to leave the Soviet Union, the term  ""Iron Curtain"" is too benign. The Curtain  has bars. The gates are virtually shut tight.  In recent weeks, the world has been given  a new and bloodly lesson on the Russian na tional character. The impunity, arrogance,  and cynical disregard  for humanity with  which they shot down Flight 007 is reflected  in every aspect of the Soviet system. And I  say this not as a screaming right-winger, but  as a man with almost impeccable liberal cre dentials and concern for human rights.  From  the moment  that one enters  the  Soviet Union,  it is abundantly clear that  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  this is a nation whose principle industry is  the repression of the human spirit. In the  words of our prayerbook, it is ""the kingdom  of  arrogance.""  It is Egypt and Amalek  wrapped into one.  It is written in the faces of the customs of ficials, most of them still in their teens, who  eye each person as they enter the Soviet  state. They stare at you, then at your pass port picture, then at the picture on your  visa, then back at you. In their eyes is writ ten large the traditional Russian response  to the world, a response as old as the first  Czars: a pathological hatred and fear of for eigners.  It is written  in  the  inability  to speak  openly about one's religion, or  life-work,  about  the synagogue, about Israel, about  any of the institutions that give us joy and  strength. Every Jewish reference must be  spoken about through the veil of euphe mism. The hotel  rooms are bugged. The  telephones are bugged. One must be careful  of who may be listening on the street. In  every home, a child's Magic Slate plays a  central role  in basic communication. Any  notes that are taken on what one sees must  be coded and then flushed down the toilet,  wrapped in absorbent American toilet paper  that has been brought  from  the United  States for just that purpose.  It is written in the eyes of the people on  the street, the people who ride the excellent  subways of Moscow and Leningrad-perhaps  the most  efficient  and most  aesthetic  system in the world. The eyes betray no joy.  They rather betray a blandness of exist ence-one Inight even say a boredom with  the world. The only sparkling smiles are in  the omnipresent posters  that paper  the  buildings of the cities,  those posters that  trumpet the traditional values of Soviet so ciety. But those values are only found  in  posters. The Russian people have grown  cynical of the dream. They covet the accou trements of the West. They want to buy my  jeans right off my body. Lenin's image is ev erywhere, but one senses that for most Rus sians, it is an empty presence.  And the Jews? What can we say about  this, the third largest Jewish community in  the world?  To look in their eyes is to see fatigue, but  despair has not snuffed out all the sparks of  hope. It has not negated the phenomenal  strength and determination of this people and their accomplishments.  Those accomplishments exist, despite the  fact that even the most basic piece of Ju daica-the child's coloring book, anything  with a Jewish symbol on it-can be an item  frought with danger. For Judaica is basical ly illegal in the Soviet Union. The most in nocuous printed matter is a ""criminal text.""  We were  told that the Leningrad  library  alone contains hundreds of  thousands of  Jewish texts. But Jews are denied access to  them. They are considered Zionist propa ganda. The only people who are allowed to  read them are the agents of the State.  Let me speak of the faith of the Russian  Jews-a faith that persists in the face of the  most overwhelming odds in the world today.  Their faith begins with the state of Israel.  For obvious reasons, it is an absolute obses sion. To meet the Russian Jews is to truly  understand Zionism  for  the  first  time.  Theirs  is a pure Zionism, one that Herzl  would have understood.  We met with Nelly of Leningrad. She is a  young grandmother who has never seen her  grandson, because he lives in Israel. She has  an aged father who lives in the Negev, and  she despairs over whether she will ever see  25543  him again. We asked her what her original  reason for going to Israel was. She told us:  ""We have a home now. Why should we live  among strangers?""  The love of the land is part of the lives of  the children, even when they are too young  to understand it. We visited with the family  of Boris E. and we took great delight in his  three year old son Eliahu. Boris's living  room is typically decorated with momentos  and pictures and maps of Israel. He tells his  son, ""Go find Jerusalem,"" and  the child  makes a beeline for the map and points to  the exact place of  the Holy City. They  flipped through the pages of a book, and  the child was able to point out the pictures  of Begin and Sharon.  We might call such things indoctrination,  perhaps even brainwashing, but it demon strates beyond a doubt that the truly suc cessful Jewish education begins in, and  is  nourished, by the home.  You must experience their love of the lan guage. It is uncanny. If ever a  language  could be idolized,  that is what they have  done with Hebrew.  Nellie told us the story of a woman named  Leah. Thirty  years  ago,  no  one  knew  Hebrew in the Soviet Union. Leah was sick  in bed, and with nothing else to do, listened  to the Hebrew broadcasts on the short-wave  radio. From this she learned Hebrew, and  ultimately, taught every one else. She was  imprisoned for her pedagogy, and when to gether we visited the old Jewish cemetery in  Leningrad, Nellie took us to visit her grave,  which is adorned with her striking photo graph.  The care,  love, and creativity that goes  into both  the  teaching and  learning of  Hebrew is astronomical, and mastering the  language is the goal of every refusenik that  we met. And they do this without formally  trained or professionally paid teachers. If  ever a sense of hevra, sacred community ex isted anywhere, it exists among the Russian  Jews, who learn from each other and with  each other.  There was the night that we studied with  the teachers circle in Leningrad-a group of  highly intelligent people in their twenties  and  thirties, most of  them ex-computer  technicians  and  scientists who  are  now  forced to work as janitors and street clean ers, I was seized by the fact that we were  studying  in secret. The Leningrad group  had been accused by  the authorities of  being a front for the Shin Bet, the Israeli  secret service. I  thought to myself, ""How  many generations of Jews have had to study  in secret? The Jews of the Roman oppres sion-the Marranos-the  Jews  of  the  Warsaw Ghetto-and now us. Our ancestors  sat and studied with us, as willing partici pants.  That night, we embraced our new friends.  With tears in our eyes, we vowed never to  forget them, never to forget their struggle,  never  to forget  these, some of  the most  heroic Jews in the world.e  INSIDE AFGHANISTAN: WAR OF  INNOCENTS  HON. BOB McEWEN  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 1983   Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Speaker, an arti cle in the September 21, 1983, edition  ",1983
351,,98,0.019,1407,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker, in a  period when the importance of agri cultural exports continue  to assume  tremendous importance to the Ameri can agricultural producer and virtually  all segments of the American econo my,  the role of private agricultural  consultants in expanding foreign com modity sales ls often overlooked.  In recognition of the contributions  made by members of the American So ciety of Agricultural Consultants,  I  submit for my colleagues' perusal the  following  article  from  that group's  May 1983 newsletter:  OVERSEAS AG CONSULTING GROWS DESPITE  WEAK WORLD EcoNOllY  The leadership role of U.S. agricultural  consultants in developing food production  and distribution systems  throughout  the  world has come into sharp focus in a survey  recently conducted by the American Society  of .Agricultural Consultants <ASAC>. Society  members reported consulting assignments in  forty-five countries around -the world. cover ing 115 different development projects. U.S.  exports could increase by as much as $420  million in goods and services necessary to  support the projects underway with U.S.  private agricultural consulting assistance.  The abillty of U.S. agricultural consult ants to successfully translate management  and technology into efficient food supply  systems was an  important  factor  in  the  strong demand for their services, despite the  continuing weakness of the world economy  and intense competition from other nations'  service  industries. Six  times as many  re spondents to the ASAC survey reported in creases  in overseas business  in  the past  twelve months as reported decreases.  Although  substantial gains were  regis tered in foreign consulting assignments by  the U.S. industry, ASAC members reported  several obstacles  to  further  increases  in  overseas ""Projects. A number of potential  U.S. consulting assignments were  lost  to  government-backed competition from mem bers of the European Community and east ern bloc nations. EC and eastern bloc na tions provide a variety of government assist ance in the form of subsidies or low cost fi nancing to service industries conpeting for  foreign business. A number of U.S. govern ment agencies and the Congress have re cently begun to investigate the effect on the  U.S. economy of service business lost to U.S.  firms by subsidized foreign competition.  25673  The potential value of exports resulting  from U.S.  consulting assignments abroad  rose by $1.6 million per consultant between  1982  and  1983  according  to  the ASAC  survey. Each U.S. consultant was involved in  development projects having an average  annual potential of $10.2 million dollars in  U.S. exports. This includes the actual busi ness services provided, and the value of the  construction,  maintenance  and  supply  equipment, as well as  the breeding stock  feed grains and other agricultural products  needed to successfully operate modem food  and fiber systems, which could be provided  by other U.S. firms. The multiplier effect of  agricultural consulting is often many times  the value of the basic services provided, as  foreign buyers generally tum to the country  which conducted the feasibillty studies for  assistance with the construction, and main tenance of the project.  The 1983 ASAC survey also indicates the  growing private sector role of foreign and  U.S. agribusiness in world food development  as government budgets are strained and na tionally-financed projects are delayed or  cancelled. In the past year, 60 percent of  the consulting assignments reported were  sponsored by private firms-39 percent by  foreign businesses, and 21 percent by Ameri can firms. Reported U.S. government spon sorship of foreign assignments using private  U.S. agricultural consultants rose to 12 per cent of the total while foreign government  sponsorship was 28 percent according to the  survey.  Africa continues to be the leading market  for U.S. agricultural consultants according  to the survey, followed by Asia and the Far  East, Europe, other North American coun tries, the Middle East, Latin America, the  Caribbean and the South Pacific.  In addition to subsidized foreign competi tion,  agricultural consultants often cited  weak world economic conditions-as a major  factor  in keeping business  faster. Many noted that currency devaluations around the world had affected their  business, while others  indicated  that de creasing  foreign government development  budgets and lack of financing proved to be  obstacles. However, many consultants told  ASAC that the demand for agricultural de velopment services remains strong. Declin ing oil prices and continuing need for for eign nations to learn how to tum U.S. agri cultural  technology  into bottom  line per formance were often cited .as signs of future  increases '111 U.S.  agricultural consulting  overseas.   from growing  NATURAL GAS PRICF.S: UP OR  DOWN?

354,House,98,0.496,115,22,Mr. HANSEN of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  remember  the  reaction of  the dele gates of the United Nations when the  Soviet Union  invaded Afghanistan,  when  the Soviets crushed  the  free  trade union Solidarity in Poland, when  they shot down the innocent Korean  airliner over the Sea of Japan?  Many delegates sat idly by and twid dled their thumbs and looked bored as  the Soviet Union used its brute force  to murder,  to  intimidate,  and  to  smother the light of freedom.  However, when the United States fi nally  showed  some  courage,  finally  had the backbone and guts to step in  to help a weak and struggling nation  avoid oppressive Marxist-Leninist tyr anny, these same U.N. delegates imme diately woke up and the walls of the  United  Nations  reverberated  with  their  speeches  of  indignation,  de nouncing the United States and her  allies who assisted in the Grenada op eration.  The scriptures tell us that righteous  people should be no respectors of per sons and should treat all people the  same way. The scriptures also have a  word for people who act as the dele gates of the United Nations acted. The  English word is ""hypocrite.""  I have been a reluctant supporter of  the United Nations  for most of my  life, but now I am beginning to wonder  why we waste our time with people  who are so blatantly dishonest.  MINIMAL  LEVEL  OF  RESPECT  FOR OUR  FELLOW MEMBERS  AND THE PRESIDENT  <Mr. WEBER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
355,House,98,0.381,115,22,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker, for our  Government to function,  it is neces sary that we as elected officials show a  certain minimal  level of  respect for  one another, and that is particularly  important when we are talking about  individuals such as the Speaker of the  House and the President of the United  States.  Now, we find ourselves in a debate  over whether or not remarks attrib uted  to  the Speaker  in yesterday's  New York Times  indeed  show  that  minimal level of respect for the Presi dent of the United States. Let us look  at the words precisely.  The Speaker  is  reported  to have  said, and I quote: ""It's sinful that this  man  is  President  of  the United  States.""  Webster's  Dictionary  defines  ""sinful"" as, ""tainted with or full of sin,  highly culpable.""  I am not going to attempt to resolve  this argument. I would just say that if  I got up in the House of Representa tives and said about one of my col leagues with whom I disagreed, that,  because he disagreed with me he was  tainted with or full of sin, my words  would be  taken down and rightfully  so. If I got up and said of one of my  Democratic  colleagues  that  it was  ""sinful"" that he had been elected in a  debate  in  the House,  that would be  viewed  as  a  serious breach of  the  comity of the House and rightfully so.  Members must ask themselves what  those words mean when they are di rected by any of our Members toward  the President of the United States.

360,House,98,-0.45,141,22,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I say  thank God we are a  representative  body in this House and that some of  us have fighting aged children, grand children, and brothers.  Let me tell you why. We have to put  this Lebanon situation to a very seri ous test and the test is  this: Do we  send our young men on a peacekeep ing mission where there is no peace? I  say that is mission impossible.  I want to point out that this amend ment, which I support, does not pre clude our Marines  from  being  sta tioned offshore. What it does do is end  our ground based presence, a prudent  and a sensible move.  Our will to bring peace in the Middle  East has never been questioned. We  can boast about the Camp David ac cords which were arrived at not militarily but politically.  of American  and  the Organization  States for this invasion.  We have been,  in effect,  trying to  overturn a government and prop up in  its place a new government  that  is  more to our liking.  In Lebanon we have moved in as a  peacekeeping force. We moved in with  the  support  of  our  allies-Britain,  France, and Italy-nations which have  castigated us for our invasion of Gre nada.  In one instance we are making war.  In the other we are making peace.  We have a great opportunity to give  a  peacemaking  opportunity  to  the  Mideast region, to allow the negotia tions a chance to work, to not under cut the potential that we have over  the next several months of giving the  government one last, albeit small, but  still existent opportunity to make this  country work.  I believe that in Grenada we ought  to end our presence, and we should  have a chance to vote on that today.  But in Lebanon we ought to stay and  give peace a chance.  I intend to off er an amendment that  would require the withdrawal of U.S.  Armed Forces from Grenada 15 days  after enactment of the Defense appro priations bill.  I would  like  to clarify  that. Since  that would be a limiting amendment,  under the new procedures there may  be a motion to rise before it may be  considered.  I urge my colleagues  to  def eat the motion to rise, regardless of  what position they may taken on the  issue. I repeat: The continued presence  of U.S. Armed Forces in Grenada is  something that should be voted on by  Congress, as the original invasion was  not.  It is time to bring U.S. Forces home  from Grenada. According to the State  Department, all Americans wishing to  leave Grenada-about half-have been  evacuated. All organized resistance to  the invasion of Grenada has ended.  United States Armed Forces should  not be used as an occupying force in  Grenada. We should remove this coun try from the tensions of the East-West  conflict.  Grenada is part of the British Com monwealth. If the Grenadians want an  interim military presence before elec tions, that presence should be supplied  by  fell ow  British  Commonwealth  countries.  The Secretary General of the Brit ish Commonwealth has already said  that a Commonwealth force could re place our forces within weeks. Canada  and New Zealand have already offered  to participate  in such a  force,  and  Great Britain has  indicated  that  it  would probably take part as well.  Our closest allies have been genuine ly enraged by the precipitous nature  of  invasion  of Grenada.  World tensions have been exacerbated,  and the relations among Caribbean nathe U.S.  This amendment will get us back on  that track, the diplomatic track, the  political track.  I hope the House has the courage to  pass  this needed amendment, and  I  yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair now  recognizes the gentleman from Michi gan <Mr. SILJANDER).

Let me suggest to my friends on the  other side supporting this amendment,  and also repeatedly stating the con sumer aspect, that the facts show that  850,000 Subarus have been sold in the  United States since 1977, and 874,000  have been recalled; 84,000 of the 1980  models were  recalled. That was  to  keep the seats from falling over. And  43,000 of the 1981 and 1982 models  were  recalled  to keep  the  steering  wheels from coming off.  The point I am making is that they  are always talking about consumer leg islation and it is unfair. They make a  better car and we cannot compete.  The facts indicate that is not true.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. COATS  yielded his time to ",1983
366,House,98,-0.398,180,22,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  tribute  to  ""Papa Bear"" George  Stanley Halas, Chicago Bears owner  for nearly six decades and founder of  the National Football League, who  died on Monday at the age of 88. The  entire city of Chicago has lost one of  its finest citizens and football enthusi asts throughout the country have lost  one of the great legends of the game.  Born on February 2, 1895, the son of  Bohemian  immigrants, George Halas  was destined to transform the game of  football  into a prominent American  sporting event and also into a major  entertainment industry. He attended  college at the University of  Illinois,  where he was a fierce competitor, and  excelled as a halfback and end in foot ball, as a basketball guard, and as a  baseball outfielder. After graduating  from college, he played professional  baseball for a short time for the New  York Yankees, until an injury ended  his promising baseball career. He soon  turned  his  energies  to  professional  football, where he laid the cornerstone  for the great game it is today.  At the time of his death, Mr. Halas  was the last survivor of a group of 12  men who founded in Canton, Ohio, on  September 17, 1920, what would later  become the National Football League.  He  loved the game and participated  with overwhelming success as a player,  an owner, and a coach. Under his out standing leadership and guiding spirit,  the Chicago Bears won the champion ship  in 1921, 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941,  1943, 1946, and in 1963, when at age  68, George Halas coached the Bears to  their last NFL title.  Through his nearly 64 seasons as a  Bear owner, Mr. Halas was the driving  force in the National Football League,  sustaining the league during its strug gling years and promoting it during its  years of prosperity. By the  time he  stopped coaching at age 73, his record,  including playoff games over four sep arate 10-year periods, was 320 wins,  14 7 losses, and 30 ties, for an impres sive .685 winning percentage.  Not only was he a great sportsman,  but also George Halas was a dedicated  and  active  community  leader.  Throughout his life he lent his name  and devoted much of his time to many  worthy community and neighborhood  projects, and charitable causes, and re ceived countless awards and accolades  for his humanitarian achievements. A  quiet and humble man off the playing  field, he often was an anonymous phi lanthropist, and  frequently declined  many awards and civic testimonials in  his honor.  George Halas was also  a  devoted  family man, and patriotic American,  who served our country with distinc tion in the Navy during both World  Wars. He was the director of the Met ropolitan Fair and Exposition Author ity which made possible the construc tion of McCormick Place in Chicago,  and also served on the board of St. Jo seph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana  and Loyola University. His humanitar ian concerns, business attributes, and  coaching  capabilities,  combined  to  make him a great citizen of the city of  Chicago. He will be sorely missed for  he won the hearts of all Chicagoans.  Not long ago he visited with me in my  Washington office, and it was a per sonal pleasure knowing a man of his  stature, dedication, and effectiveness.  George Halas will remain a legend in  the history of football and in the his tory of Chicago. Mrs. Annunzio and I  extend our deepest sympathy to the  members of his  family who  survive  him. His life was an inspiration to all  who had the privilege of knowing him  and he will never be forgotten.  Mr. Speaker, excerpts from an arti cle  about  the  life  and  accomplish ments of George Halas, from the No vember 1 edition of the Chicago Sun Times follow:  GEORGE HALAS DIES-OWNER OF BEARS WAS  88  <By Kevin Lamb)  Papa Bear is dead.  When George Stanley Halas died  in his  North Side apartment Monday evening, the  world lost a reassuring link with the past. In  an era when corporate symbols alternate be tween boardrooms and boredom, the Chica go Bears' patriarch recalled a  time when  successful people were big enough to reach  down for their bootstraps. The man actually  invented an entertainment business.  Mr. Halas had been  the  last surviving  founder of the National Football League for  several years before he died at 8:35 p.m. He  was 88 and had been ill with heart disease,  pancreatic cancer and other ailments  for  more than a year. He was declared dead by  Dr. Neal Stone,  said his grandson, Rich  McCaskey, Halas' daughter, Virginia Mccas key, was with him when he died, Mccaskey  said.  The Chicago Bears  franchise  that had  cost George Halas $100 in 1920 had grown in  value to an estimated $40 million.  ""I never thought it would be this big,"" Mr.  Halas said of the league on his 82nd birth day. ""My goodness, it was beyond compre hension.""  Professional football and Mr. Halas grew  side by side, each nurturing the other, until  the sport became a national institution and  the man became a legend. ""It has been the  most priceless privilege of my professional  life  to see our dreams come  true and  to  watch our ugly duckling grow up to be a  ",1983

Mr. Sayenga, an octogenerian hu manitarian, served as chairman for 10  years of the association, which is dedi cated to fighting myasthenia gravis, a  crippling  neuromuscular  disease  of  weakness.  Since 1955, when his daughter Carol  was  stricken with  the disease, Mr.  Sayenga has served on the board of di rectors of  the  association. He  now  serves as chairman emeritus. A World  War  I veteran, he  is a  retired vice  president of the Union National Bank.  The devotion of Mr. Sayenga to good  works has continued in his years of re tirement. For the past 7 years, he has  served as a volunteer driver 2 days a  week  for  the Brookine Meals  on  Wheels  program  for  the  elderly.  During the past 4 years, he has assist ed disabled veterans and their families  at the Oakland Veterans' Administra tion hospital.  Mr.  Speaker,  by  his  deeds, Mr.  Sayenga shows us that one need not  retire a concern for  the community  upon  leaving  full  time employment.

368,Senate,98,0.641,245,22,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  today marks only  the seventh  time  that a separate budget authorization  bill has been introduced for U.S. intel ligence activities. The budget authori zation process is now standard proce and  represents  clear  evidence  dure  that our constitutional responsibilities  can be  fulfilled while, at  the same  time, maintaining the confidentiality  necessary for an effective intelligence  system.  No other nation in the world does  what we have been doing now for the  past 7 years. No other nation in the  world allows its legislative branch to  oversee,  in detail, and authorize the  budget for its intelligence community.  In my  judgment,  this  is  the best  system there is to provide accountabil ity for the intelligence activities of our  Government. The annual authoriza tion process  is  now  an  established  practice in our Government. I  think  that it works very well to insure that  we have a strong and effective intelli gence  community which  is,  at  the  same time, responsive to the needs of  our people.  Earlier this year,  the Budget Sub committee of the Senate Select Com mittee on Intelligence held numerous  closed hearings and we have engaged  in hundreds of hours of staff  inter views and briefings in putting together  the bill which is on the floor today.  We have examined in detail the budg ets of the Central Intelligence Agency,  the National Security Agency, and the  intelligence activities of  the Depart ments of Defense, State, and Treas ury, and of the Federal Bureau of In vestigation.  Additionally, the full committee met  many  times  to  further  refine  this  budget authorization bill. In particu lar, we devoted a tremendous amount  of attention  to  the administration's  covert action requests. So I want to re affirm to my colleagues  the serious ness with which we take our responsi bilities for authorizing these activities.  Also, I wish to reiterate to all Mem bers  that documentary materials  in  possession of the committee are avail able  for  review. If Members have a  question about what we are doing or  what we have done, they should let us  know, and we will be glad  to share  these materials with them under the  provisions of Senate Resolution 400.  Mr.  President,  I  thank my  col leagues, in particular, Senator WALLOP  and Senator INOUYE, the distinguished  chairman and vice chairman of our  Budget Subcommittee, for their hard  work and effort in preparing this legis lation. These two gentlemen and their  colleagues on the Budget Subcommit tee are responsible for much of the  work, and they are to be commended  for it. Given the extremely short time  period we have had to finish this proc ess this year, I want to say that the co operation  and  patience  that  was  shown to us by all concerned was a  tribute  to  the professional attitude  and dedication of these people.  Also, I would like to thank the staff  of the Senate Intelligence Committee  and to acknowledge the fine work they  have done in preparing and presenting  ",1983
369,Senate,98,0.087,349,22,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing  for  the  consider ation of the Senate legislation to pro vide for stabilization of fares  in the  airline industry, without re-regulation.  Essentially,  its modest purpose  is  to  impose  some order  and predictable  regularity to a pricing regime which  has become a  crazy quilt of rapidly  changing fares which baffle the con sumer and travel industry, and which  undermine the possibility of orderly,  and sound financial planning for the  airlines.  The bill simply  requires  reinstate ment of tariff-filing requirements with  60-day notice-30 days  for matching  fares. The  bill would  also  require  fares, as filed, to remain in effect for  at least 90 days, except to match an other carrier's price change.  I am aware that the state of the air line  industry  is of great concern  to  many of my colleagues. This is a com plicated problem brought about by  many factors ranging from the reces sion to implementation of the Airline  Deregulation Act of 1978. There may  ",1983
370,House,98,-0.516,401,22,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man,  the  gentleman  from  Florida,  however, last night characterized this  amendment for what it actually is.  I  am paraphrasing now, but if the Mem bers will read the RECORD from yester day that is under their seats, they will  find that he said it very bluntly and  honestly, and there can be no question  where he stands on this legislation. He  has opposed it for years, and he has  done it openly. He has given his rea sons for opposing  it. He and I have  had our disagreements-very spirited  ones-during the last 2 years over his  reasons.  But he did say last night, as one who  believes that this bill should not pass  under  any  circumstances,  that  this  amendment has the same effect as an  amendment to strike all after the en acting clause.  Now, if we want to do it that way, we  should come on out in Main Street so  that people can see us. We should not  go skulking down the alley and try to  kill this bill by shooting it in the back  in a dark alley. The gentleman should  stand up and off er a motion to strike  all after the enacting clause and see  how  the House stands on  that. He  should not try to do  it through the  back door.  I do not ascribe any less than the  highest motives  to  the  gentleman  from Indiana, but if indeed he feels as  sincere as he has described his feelings  about this amendment, then he ought  to recognize that at this point he has  become an  instrument  to do  some thing  far more  draconian  and  far  broader than he had anticipated, not  only to this legislation but to our rela tionship with 87 other countries with  whom we have to trade and to whom  we have to try to sell our goods.  I have heard a  lot of  talk about  sending messages. If we want to send a  message to the other 87 trading coun tries that GATT does not mean a tin ker's dam when  it  is convenient for  them to run around it and create a  new device  to substitute their courts  appointed by their government for our  equal standing in GATT. If we want to  send that message, we can vote for the  Coats amendment. If we want to pre serve GATT and we want to go on and  consider the problems that the gentle man has raised, let us consider them  in  amendments  that  are  properly  drafted to accomplish that purpose.  ",1983
371,House,98,-0.31,401,22,Mr. LUNDINE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the Coats amendment.  I do so because I believe it is unwise to  include a provision  in  this bill  that  would in essence leave the determina tion of the terms for implementation  of  this bill  to the U.S. courts. This  amendment would do so by entitling  other countries to seek compensation  under our law if there is a finding that  this bill in some way violates the pro visions of GATT.  It is not clear whether or not this  bill would violate GATT. There are  procedures  established  under  the  GATT to make that determination if  indeed a foreign nation wishes to chal lenge the provisions of this law. And  there are also procedures established  under the GA TT for consideration of  possible foreign retaliatory measures.  In any event it seems to me such a  proceeding will  be  very  interesting  given the fact that many nations of  the world already have in place con tent requirements for various  indus tries.  I support this bill, not because it is a  perfect prescription for the problems  that plague our auto  industry, but  rather because I believe  that House  passage of  this bill  is an  important  first step  toward dealing with  those  problems. Currently, we have no trade  policy. It is largely because we have no  trade policy that has brought us  to  this point. And until we develop the  determination  to coordinate a  trade  policy that will insure a healthy indus trial future for this country, bills like  auto content must continue to receive  support.  I also cannot stand here and tell you  that  I  believe  that GATT  is  the  answer  to our problems. While we  must certainly strive to  improve the  GATT framework and to work coop eratively with other nations to resolve  trade problems, at the same time, we  must realize  that in many  instances  GATT is  today totally  ineffective  in  dealing with many problems  facing  our internationally traded businesses.  The problem of foreign  targeting of  industries, for example, cannot be re solved  under  the  existing  GATT  framework  in  a  timely or effective  way. This is primarily because many  of the  instruments being utilized by  some of our trading partners for ad vancing the interests of their own in dustries are not addressed  in GATT  standards or procedures.  Finally, we should not adopt a provi sion in this bill which will give foreign  nations or  firms  standing or access  under U.S.  law  to  seek  retribution  against U.S. firms. This is very unwise.  goes  against  the  fundamental  notion that what we need in this coun try is more coordination of national in terests and strategies to implement a  trade policy and other domestic poli cies geared  toward economic growth  and prosperity for our people. We will  not be able to accomplish this if we  are being undercut in our own courts.  I will vote against this amendment,  and support  this bill.  I hope  to be  present to cast my vote for this bill  today before I must leave for impor tant business in my congressional dis trict. If I do miss the final vote on this  bill, I have already made provision to  It  ",1983
372,House,98,-0.28,414,22,Mr. KOLTER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 1234,  the  Fair Practices in Automotive Products  Act. This very important bill would es tablish urgently needed domestic con tent requirements for vehicles sold in  the United States.  The auto industry has an enormous  impact on the economy and employ ment in this country. We must have a  vibrant auto industry if we are to have  a true economic recovery. It is estimat ed that we have  lost over 1 million  jobs in the auto and related industries  since the mid-1970's because of foreign  imports  and  the number  is  rising  sharply. The House passed a domestic  content bill last year but the Senate  unfortunately failed to act on it. We  need  this  legislation now more than  ever so let us send a message to the  Senate, the President, and the Ameri can people by voting overwhelmingly  to pass the Fair Practices in Automo tive Products Act.  The steel industry has been particu larly hard hit by the weakened domes tic auto market but  then  the same  could probably be said about the plas tics, rubber, electronics, and glass in dustries. Regardless of the industry we  point to, the results are the same: Un precedented levels of unemployment.  If we continue to allow the industrial  base of this country to erode, we not  only threaten any economic recovery  we may have but also the national se curity of the United States. No great  nation can remain great for very long  without a strong and healthy industri al base.  It is time for us to show the world  that we will no longer allow them total  access to the greatest consumer nation  in the world while they slap us in the  face by  restricting  the products we  want to sell in their country.  The free  trade policy that this ad ministration  espouses  has  cost  us  jobs-hundreds of thousands of them.  While we def end and protect our allies  in the world, they build cars and send  them here. While we spend billions of  dollars on defense, Japan and coun tries in Western Europe spend billions  of dollars subsidizing their auto and  steel industries. While they put their  people to work, we put ours in the un employment  line. While  they  have  growing economies,  in western Penn sylvania we have an economic recovery  that is always around the comer. No  other industrial country who produces  autos allows the amount of foreign im ports that we allow. These countries  have industrial and trade policies that  encourage exports and prohibit  im ports. Italy restricts Japanese imports  to less than 1 percent. France restricts  Japanese imports to 2.5 percent. Great  Britain and West Germany restrict all  foreign  imports  to  11  percent  and  Japan restricts imports to less than 1  percent. Compared  to  these  figures,  the 28 percent of imported cars sold in  the United States almost makes it look  like we are trying to self-destruct our  auto industry. Make no mistake about  it, we need a domestic content bill.  Over 30  industrial countries already  have domestic content  laws on  the  books.  H.R.  1234  simply  states  that  the  more cars a company wants to sell in  the United States the more they are  required to build those cars here. It  seems only  fair  that  if  a  company  wants to take advantage of the largest  automarket in the world, it ought to  put some of the manufacturing in that  market. That  is what would be  required if this bill became law. Oppo nents of the bill claim that this is a  quota bill-reducing competition  by  shutting imports out of our market but actually the bill is an investment  bill that would require that foreign car  companies to put plants here in order  to maintain access to the U.S. market.  This  requirement  would  obviously  help put  some  of  those  1 million  people back to work.  I urge all of my colleagues to join  with me and send a message  to the  world. It is time for a fair trade policy  in  the United States.  It  is  time  to  bring our trade policy in line with re ality and into today's real world. Like  so many of  the other policies, pro grams,  and  ideas  espoused by  this  President, his free trade policy belongs  to a different era.  We owe it to the American people  and to the millions of unemployed to  pass this very important legislation.   e ",1983
373,House,98,-0.374,414,22,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  I would  like to associate myself fully with the  remarks of the gentleman from New  York and want to commend both him  and the distinguished chairman of the  committee <Mr. DINGELL) for their out standing leadership on this issue. I rise  in strong support of  the  legislation  before us, H.R. 1234.  I have heard  some of our colleagues argue that the  House should not act favorably on this  bill as it is a protectionist piece of leg islation, not in keeping with our free  trade heritage. Let those who bemoan  local content legislation tell us what  alternatives  they propose. We have  certainly heard a great deal of criti cism and doomsday predictions, but  there has been precious little offered  by way of concrete and viable alterna tives.  I would ask those Members to  face  the  180,000  unemployed  auto  workers and the 600,000 people who  remain out of work in the auto suppli er industries and tell them that this is  not the best way to assist the auto in dustry.  The facts are before us. The number  of unemployed Americans has reached  a level that cannot be ignored or even  tolerated  in  the short run by  those  elected  to  represent  the  interests of  our citizens. Even the slight upturn in  recent economic activity has not allevi ated the effects of the recession which  threaten the collapse of many of our  basic  industries. How  can we-how  should we-respond?  I believe that H.R. 1234  is the one  effective tool currently available to en courage those who wish to take advan tage of the American market to invest  here  in our country. Moreover,  this  legislation is significant as an expres sion of the building frustration in the  United States about the gross inequi ties we encounter in the international  trading practices of many of the major  trading nations. It must be made clear  ",1983

376,House,98,-0.347,479,22,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it is with some hesi tation that I  take the floor to speak  against  this amendment,  since  I  do  have so much respect for the gentle man from Georgia.  It seems as though we are talking at  cross purposes here. The gentleman is  quite right when he says this House  should never give away  its right  to  draw  regulations  to  some unelected  bureaucrat. But the way we maintain  that right I think is the key issue, not  that we should have the right.  Let me just briefly speak from my  experience in the Wisconsin State Leg islature. We tried this sort of thing.  We  carefully  considered what  you  might call a Levitas-type approach but  it fell of its own weight. It meant, in  fact,  everything had  to  be  passed  twice. We would  have  had  to  go  through  a  doubletrack  system  for  every measure  requiring  regulations:  First the bill  itself, then the regula tion.  We came up with a better way, final ly, and that was to give each House a  time certain during which  it could  review-the committees of authority could review specific proposed regula tions. If they interposed no objection,  then  the  regulations would go  into  effect. So each House of the legisla tion had a window of time to react to  those regulations which came to their  attention as being onerous, impossible,  or unwise. Both Houses would have to  act  in order  to suspend and rewrite  regulations.  But neither House was required to  act on each one of  the voluminous  bodies of administrative law, much of  which was fine. That seemed to be for  us in Wisconsin a much better way. It  lightened the load tremendously.  I  can  just  imagine what would  happen to the length of congressional  sessions  if we had  to double  track  every issue twice through both Houses  and through the White House.  But  the more  important point  I  would like to raise with the gentleman  from Georgia, and I hope he will re spond to a question, is this: It seems to  me there is an inherent logical contra diction to what the gentleman is pro posing. If we  take as given  that we  cannot have a one-House veto, and we  agree that once we pass legislation in  both Houses and it is signed at the  White House and becomes the will of  the full Congress, then under the Levi tas approach one House could subse quently on this second track around  thwart the will of the entire Congress  and of the executive branch by simply  ref using to act.  You therefore are back in the box of  a one-House veto. A one-House veto by  inaction.  I would ask  the gentleman  to  re spond to this internal logical contra diction that would be set up by his  proposal.  ",1983
377,,98,0.217,544,22,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, on the  occasion of National Drug Education  Week,  I would  like  to point  to  the  many parents across the country who  are constructively addressing the trag edy of drug and alcohol use among our  young people.  Although drug use is not a new prob lem  in  this country,  it has become  frighteningly  epidemic. More  and  more children are experimenting with  drugs and alcohol at a younger and  younger age to the extent that drugs  and alcohol together have become the  leading cause of death among Ameri can  teenagers.  Some  16,000  young  people were killed in a recent year in  alcohol-related traffic fatalities alone;  50 percent of the 5,000  teenage sui cides last year were attributed to alco hol and pills.  A ray of hope in this unfortunate  situation is  that parents around the  country are courageously facing  the  possibility that their own children are  being robbed of a normal and healthy  childhood through the specter of drug  and  alcohol  abuse. At  least  5,000  parent peer groups have been orga nized and are working energetically to  deter  the use of alcohol and drugs  among  their  communities'  young  people.  Hopefully  the  determined  efforts  and  successes  of  these  concerned  parent  groups will  be  built  upon  through their sponsorship of an up coming public television broadcast of  ""The Chemical People,""  a  two-part  series designed to bring parents and  citizens  together  and  off er  them  guidelines for helping young people.  Last night and on November 9, com munities in my district will be among  12,000 communities around the coun try gathering to watch this broadcast.  Program 1 will supply hard inf orma tion about the alcohol and drug abuse  problem and lead to a discussion of  the  local  situation. Program 2 will  focus on how other parents, schools,  and neighbors are fighting drugs and  alcohol and provide the basis for the  establishment of a  community  task  force.  Recently, the director of ""The Gate way"" a comprehensive treatment pro gram for chemically dependent adoles cents, Dr.  Joseph Novello,  testified  before a crisis intervention hearing of  the Select Committee on Children,  Youth, and Families. In his testimony,  Dr. Novello pointed out that:  No one single group or institution is at  ""fault"" <for the epidemic of teenager drug  abuse>: not  the Federal Government, not  parents, not the schools, not the media, not  even psychiatrists-and surely not the teen agers themselves.  He went on to stress, however, that:  If none of us stands alone as the prob lem-we must stand together as the solu tion.  I would like to applaud the dedicat ed individuals in my district and across  the  country who  have  committed  thelilSelves to be part of this solution.  They have  translated  their  love  for  their children into an honest and de termined campaign for  their future.  Their efforts should serve as an inspi ration to involvement for us all.e  ACID RAIN  HON. EDWIN 8. FORSYTHE  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 3, 1983  e ",1983
378,,98,0.326,544,22,Mr. FORSYTHE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues the recent remarks of  John D. Feehan,  chairman of  the  board and president of Atlantic City  Electric Co. I think Mr. Feehan's com ments are worthy of our consideration  as we deal with the issue of acid rain.  His remarks follow:  REMARKS OF JOHN D. FEEHAN  My name is John Feehan and I am Chair man of the Board and President of Atlantic  City Electric Company which  serves  the  electric energy needs of the Southern third  of this State. In recent years I have also  served as President of the New Jersey Utili ty Association, as Chairman of the Board of  the New Jersey State Chamber of Com merce, as Chairman of the New Jersey Cap ital Budgeting and Planning Commission  and as a Director of the Governor's Manage ment Improvement Project. I mention these  other activities to suggest that my remarks  come  from  a  broader  perspective  than  simply that of a utility chief executive.  I want  to commence by wishing you a  ""Happy  Anniversary.""  Ten  years  ago,  almost to this exact date, the Arab Oil Em bargo commenced. That event had a world wide  and  continuing  impact  on  energy  prices and rampant inflation. In New Jersey  we saw a major disruption in energy supply  and a dramatic increase in the cost of all  forms of energy, including electricity. Was  that  event unpredictable-my  answer  to  that is a resounding ""No.""  In 1971  I  testified before this very New  Jersey Clean Air Council when New Jersey  Department of Environmental Protection  was hell-bent on driving the last trace of  coal out of New Jersey by its very stringent  particulate, smoke and S02 regulations. We  warned that we were being forced to use low  sulfur overseas oil. I testified in 1971 as fol lows:  ""In the current fuels crisis, the complete  elimination of a basic fuel source <coal>  is  pure folly and places this State, the East  Coast and the Nation in an extremely vul nerable position.""

We have some ins and outs  there that are necessary.  I commend the Senator from New  Mexico, and I hope he follows up on  his interest and his efforts to encour age this basic research and reaching  out to let the services reach out into  institutions that are in the business.  At the same time, there is a lot in  what  the Senator from Alaska says  here. We are going to have to try to  have a real conference on this bill, and  there Will be in conference the differ ence between the total amount here  that he refers to and the amount that  we have put in the bill. For my part,  and I am expecting to be one of the  conferees, I will certainly promise to  give this further consideration at that  time.  But I believe  in keeping with this  handling of the bill generally now it  would be best to leave this the way the  committee has it at that figure with  the promise, and  the Senator from  Alaska has made the same promise,  that it actually will be in conference  and we will seek further  facts and  listen to the House side and see what  can be done.  This is a basic sound purpose. The  amendment  can well  apply,  and  I  think though that should be my posi tion.  Again I hope that the Senator will  follow up his interest and attention to  this kind of research.

So I will support the committee's po sition on all the facts now, but I will  reconsider it in the conference.  ",1983
383,,98,-0.245,700,22,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  take  this opportunity  to  once again bring to the attention of  my colleagues the serious nature of  the administrative problems now being  brought to light with regard to the Ag riculture Department's  payment-in kind program.  The current issue of the Delta Farm  Press carries a headline article which  very well states in detail the seemingly  endless number of f oulups which have  been committed by the USDA in its  feeble attempt to carry out the PIK  program.  In my opinion, the Reagan adminis tration made a serious mistake in by passing the Congress when it was for mulating  its policies and procedures  for the PIK program. This is especial ly unforgivable now that we learn the  PIK program is going to cost Ameri can taxpayers an unbelievable $11  to  $12 billion. I hope we have all learned  a lesson from the failures of PIK, and  that is, that the Department of Agri culture and the Congress and the agri cultural community must do a better  job of coordinating our efforts as we  begin to build a farm policy which will  carry us through the remainder of the  eighties.  I  applaud  the Delta Farm  Press for having the courage to exam ine the PIK program and speak out on  just what a disaster it has been. I rec ommend  the article  to all my col leagues, and request that it be printed  following my remarks.  [From the Delta Farm Press, Oct. 28, 19831  PIK DELIVERY FOULED UP BY REAGAN PEOPLE  Nobody ever said that the ""shoot from the  hip"" PIK program would be easy to carry  out, but the monumental task of getting the  commodities to farmers is obviously proving  to be more than the Reagan Administration  can handle.  Although Argriculture Department offi cials has more than six months to prepare  November 4, 1983  for the distribution of payment-in-kind, this  is the situation to date:  A large number of rice growers still have  not received certificates of entitlement for  ""crop swap"" that were due in August and  September.  LONG DISTANCE STORAGE  Many of those who have been waiting for  several weeks for payment on PIK rice that  is stored hundreds of miles away-much of  it in California-rather than in nearby ele vators as promised.  Farmers in the Midwest and parts of the  Southeast are being given com of a substan tially lower grade and quality than listed on  their Commodity Credit Corporation Form  477-1, PIK entitlement.  Most of the producers in the mid-section  of the Cotton Belt will be at least a month  late in receiving their PIK because of diffi culties  stemming  from  the government's  controversial Plant-for-PIK program.  The lengthy delays are costing farmers  millions of dollars in interest and carrying  charges on loans they had planned to pay  off on their PIK delivery dates.  BANKERS QUESTIONING  ""We had set up several of our notes to  come due in August,"" said Larry LeJeune, a  rice and soybean farmer in Elton, La.  ""We even made them for August 15 rather  than August 1 <the entitlement date for  PIK rice in south Louisiana> in case of a  slight for delay. Boy, that was a laugh.''  LeJeune had farms with four Agricultural  Stabilization  and  Conservation  Service  serial numbers signed up in the rice PIK.  The situation on the first was relatively  simple. The rice was stored in a local eleva tor and he said the certificate of entitle ment shortly after receiving it on Septem ber 18.  NO CERTIFICATE  162  On the last, the farmer knows he is due  1,107 barrels of rice that are stored in an el evator  in California.  <A  barrel  is  pounds.) But he had not received the certifi cate of entitlement for it as of October 21.  Part of the reason for the lengthy delays,  for LeJeune and others has been the diffi culty  the Commodity Credit Corporation  has had in getting a handle on rice supplies  available for crop swap.  Although  signup  for  the program was  completed last March 11, it was obvious that  as late as August USDA officials still did not  know how much rice was due farmers or  how much they had in investory.  In July, ASCS staff members were telling  growers  in Louisiana and Mississippi that  shortages of PIK rice in their area would be  made up with Arkansas long grain rice.  RICE SHUFFLE  <Texas producers already had been  in formed that much of their payment-in-kind  would have  to come  from medium grain  stocks in California.>  A few weeks later, however, ASCS officials  learned they didn't have enough Arkansas  rice for growers in other Mid-South states.  They announced a drawing would be held to  determine which farmers would be required  to take medium grain rice from California.  That was the first drawing. Then ASCS  discovered additional rice in transit and a  second was held. And then a third.  ""What gets me is that from April on, they  knew  they had  to get  their  inventory  in  shape for distributing the payment-in-kind,""  said LeJeune. ""But as best we can tell they  didn't start doing anything about it until  July.""  ",1983

386,Senate,98,0.322,1051,22,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, this  Friday, November 11, is Veterans Day  1983. On that day the citizens of our  great Nation will pause and express  their gratitude to those who have sac rificed so much that this great Nation  may continue to enjoy the blessings of  freedom and liberty. What those val iant men who fought in World War l and all of our wars since then-have  done for us remains vivid in our minds.  It is appropriate that we set aside a  day such as this: A day to celebrate  the end of that war, the ""war to end  all wars,"" as a tribute to this Nation's  28.5 million  living veterans and  to  those who have gone on before.  It is particularly fitting, as we do  this,  to note that Veterans Day this  year falls in ""National Disabled Veter ans Week,"" a week set aside to pay a  special tribute to those veterans suf fering from disabilities incurred in the  service of their country.  Certainly there is no greater obliga tion on the part of a government than  to assure the defense of its citizenry  and def end its borders. And, as a con tinuing expense of that national self defense, a government is further obli gated in a broad variety of ways to  meet  the needs of  those who have  given up a portion of their life to fight  at the Nation's call. The obligation to  provide  compensation  to  those dis abled in the service of their country is  one that has always been recognized  as  the highest duty of  a  grateful  nation. The provision of high quality  health care such as is provided by our  Veterans' Administration through its  172 hospitals, its 226 outpatient clin ics, its 99 nursing homes and 15 domi ciliaries-both  to  those  disabled  in  service and, to the extent facilities are  available, to other veterans in need of  such care is unquestionable. The pro vision of a pension  to veterans dis abled, resulting not in the service of  their country, yet who are in financial  need,  is but another of the Nation's  commitments. The provision of a vari ety of benefits to assist in the rehabili tation of veterans or in their readjust ment to civilian life following service is  of particular import. And finally, the  provision of a dignified final resting  place, where our veterans are assem bled one last time as they enter eterni ty, constitutes our final and finest ob ligation  to  those  selfless men  and  women, who have given of themselves  that we may remain free.  As we commemorate Veterans Day  this week, it is particularly appropri ate that, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and  in behalf of its members, I pay par ticular credit  to our wartime veter ans-to those who gave much to our  Nation, fought for it, preserved it, and  made it great.  It is fitting at this time to briefly  review some of the legislative accom plishments of the Congress in behalf  of veterans during the preceding year.  It has  been  a  year  of  significant  achievement. Last Thursday, this body  passed  H.R.  2920,  the  Veterans'  Health Care Amendments of 1983, im proving  the quality, scope, and effi ciency of health-care services available  through the Veterans' Administration  to our veterans.

395,,98,-0.391,1272,22,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues  attention an op-ed piece recently pub lished in the New York Times on the  state of productivity in the U.S. work place. The author, Seymor Melman, is  a professor of industrial engineering at  Columbia University. Mr. Melman  argues  that  the management  tier,  which has been taught to make money  not goods, has contributed toward the  declining  competitiveness  of Ameri can-produced goods not only in inter national markets, but in the United  November 8, 1983  States as well. The step this country  must take to rebuild its industrial base  and restore the competitiveness of its  goods is to invite the workers, who ac tually design and build the products,  to participate  in the decisionmaking  within the company.  I urge my col league to read this article:  MANAGERS'I>EBACLE  <By Seymour Melman)  From left to right, policy proposals for in dustrial renewal share a core assumption:  that American managers as a group are in terested in and capable of restoring compe tence in production. This assumption, once  unchallengeable, is obsolete.  A  generation  of managers  has  been  trained by our business schools  to make  money, not goods. Gripped by  a  dogma  called ""management science,""  the schools  have played an important institutional role  in the erosion of competence for production.  Until recently, American managers were  the world's best organizers of  industrial  work. That was  the basis of their profits  and their claim to large personal  income.  The managers performed a vital function:  To live, a community. must produce.  For two centuries, a tacit understanding, a  social contract, has been in force. In return  for  its decisionmaking power and wealth,  management was expected by society to or ganize work. The legitimacy of that contract  rarely has been challenged.  American  industry's productiveness and  all-around competence was a source of na tional pride. Whatever the criticism, man agement was perceived as fully interested in  and able to organize production, the source  of wealth. No one doubted that investing in  and efficiently operating the means of pro duction, especially those of basic industry,  was  the high  road  to wealth,  fame and  power.  In the last 25 years, management's social  contract with workers and the community  has been broken as managers have turned  from making goods  to making money by  means other than production. The result of  this transformation  in management's pro fessional imperatives is visible in the disso lution of production competence  in once great industries. These industries have been  managed by persons  increasingly oriented  toward profits by financial strategems, com modity speculation and fast-return  invest ments, finally striving for profits without  the burdens of any production at all.  At the same time, a state-managed mili tary economy, guided by costand subsidy maximizing,  is precisely the reverse of in dustrial efficiency. But it is a moneymaker  and power base for everyone involved in it.  A firm's failure once enabled more compe tent management to take over production  and marketing positions. Not any more. As  managers' competence in making goods be comes  increasingly  rare,  and  ploys  for  making money dominate,  industrial decay  spreads. Top managers in remote central of fices leave entire communities and regions  economically stranded. Imported goods re place American goods. Jobs in producing oc cupations are severely reduced, hardly af fected by the trickle of new work in high tech industries.  Meanwhile,  business  schools  rationalize  the collapse of entire industries with facile  explanations about post-industrialized socie ty,  sunset and sunrise  industries,  service  economies, subsidized imports, Government  ",1983

This amend ment would cost the Government over  $1 billion more than the compromise  bill. Consumers' benefits of the Con able amendment will not materialize.  Historically, very little, if any, of the  savings from a support price reduction  have found their way to the consum ers.  This year Florida farm milk prices  dropped by  95  cents per hundred weight. Yet, the retail price remained  the same. Not one cent of the savings  was passed on to the consumer.  While  the Conable amendment by  lowering milk price supports provides  just as much incentive, as does the bill  for farmers  to slaughter their dairy  cows,  the Conable amendment pro vides no orderly procedure for market ing the slaughtered stock.  Recently, I met with more than 150  dairymen in my district. To some of  them, passage of a  dairy bill  is  a  matter of survival.  Stick with  the  compromise  and  def eat the Conable amendment.

400,House,98,-0.204,1402,22,Mr. CLARKE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Conable amendment.  I am a dairyman and I represent a  lot of the North Carolina dairymen,  all of whom want the Conable amend ment.  The real problem we are discussing  is how to reduce the enormous surplus  of milk in this country. The diversion  program contained in the compromise  bill simply will not do it. The loss of  cash flow created by the heavy assess ment is already causing some dairies  to increase production.  Some dairies will sell out entirely,  thereby putting heavy pressure on  beef prices. A few dairies would cut back enough to qualify for the $10 per  hundredweight payment, but I suspect  that a  lot of them would hold back  their heifers for freshening at the end  of the 15-month period covered by the  bill.  The final result of the compromise  would be almost no net decrease  in  milk production. And  the proposed  costly advertising program would not  do much, if anything, to increase milk  sales. Similar advertising and promo tion programs are already in operation  in many parts of the country with lim ited success.  The only way we can achieve a real  decrease in milk production is to cut  the  support  price  as  the Conable  amendment provides up to $1.50 per  hundredweight. This will  cost  the  Government less in the long run and it  will get dairying back on a sound basis.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support the Conable substitute. It is  a way to get rid of the dairy surplus. If  ",1983

403,,98,-0.247,1493,22,Mr. WALGREN.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  much-needed attention  recently has  been focused upon the serious prob lems that exist in science and mathe matics education in this country. In its  annual review of the National Science  Foundation's budget,  the Committee  on Science  and Technology  for  a  number of years has urged more em phasis on science and engineering edu cation; and earlier this year the Sci ence Committee and the Committee  on Education and Labor developed  H.R. 1310, a bill to improve math, sci ence, and engineering education and  teacher training. The House promptly  passed the bill on March 2;  it is dis31865  heartening that the Senate has not  acted now for 8 months.  To address these issues, the National  Science Board-NSF's policymaking  body-established in 1982 its Commis sion on Precollege Education in Math ematics, Science and Technology. The  Commission's report, with recommen dations, was released this September.  Also, NSF reestablished its Directorate  on Science and Engineering Educa tion, as announced on September 28,  1983,  by NSF Director Edward A.  Knapp.  Dr. Knapp met with the National  Science Board on October 20, 1983, to  outline NSF's program to improve sci ence and math education in the Na tion's  elementary  and  secondary  schools. I would like to share with my  colleagues the text of an NSF press re lease on Dr. Knapp's report  to  the  Board. I hope that Congress will see,  in the fiscal year 1985 NSF budget re quest from the Reagan administration,  a reflection of Dr. Knapp's statements  supporting an aggressive NSF program  to  improve science and math educa tion.  The information follows:  NSB Is PRESENTED NSF PROGRAM To  IM PROVE PRECOLLEGE SCIENCE AND MATH EDU CATION  A National Science Foundation <NSF)  report, presented to the National Science  Board <NSB> Thursday <October 20), out lined major components of an NSF program  designed to improve the science and mathe matics education of the Nation's elementary  and secondary school students.  The NSB is the policymaking body of the  Foundation.  The report, prepared at the direction of  Dr. Edward A. Knapp, Director of NSF, said  the activities focused on the precollege area  were research on and development of in structional materials in science and mathe matics for students and teachers; programs  to provide incentives for teachers and devel op their capabilities; and special programs  aimed at  increasing  informal science and  mathematics education, expanding dissemi nation  of  information  about  successful  projects, and monitoring the state of science  and mathematics education.  The key goal of the fiscal 1984 precollege  activities, the report stated, was the same as  that expressed recently by the NSB Com mission on Precollege Education in Mathe matics, Science and Technology. That goal  is to strengthen by 1995 precollege science  and mathematics education so as  to "". . .  provide all the Nation's youth with a level  of education  in mathematics, science and  technology,  as measured by achievement  scores and participation levels <as well as  other non-subjective criteria),  that is not  only the highest quality attained anywhere  in the world but also reflects the particular  and peculiar needs of our Nation.""  The report noted that achieving this goal  would produce three practical advantages:  better preparation of students  for wider  career choices; better preparation of stu dents for living in a high-technology, infor mation society; and an increase in the pool  of students adequately  trained  to pursue  college  and  university  opportunities  in  mathematics, science, and technology.

404,,98,0.3,1519,22,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, the U.S.  action in Grenada to rescue American  citizens and restore democracy has re ceived broad support throughout the  United States. A recent bipartisan del egation  of our  colleagues  returned  with the clear conviction that Presi dent Reagan was right to send U.S.  forces to the tiny island, in response to  the request of our eastern Caribbean  allies.  Perhaps the time has come for some  of our other allies to rethink their ini tial lack of support for the President's  decision, and focus  instead on what  might be done to prevent future Marx ist  takeovers  in  the Caribbean and  elsewhere in the world.  Sir Philip Goodhart  is  a British  Member of Parliament and  former  Under Secretary of State at the Minis try of Defense under Mrs. Thatcher. A  recent New York Ti.mes editorial, mini mizing the threat Grenada's occupiers  posed to other free, small States in the  hemisphere, provoked Sir Philip to re spond. He graciously provided me a  copy of his letter to the editor, which I  would  like  to  share with my  col leagues.  He observes that, lacking adequate  defense, small States are almost as  vulnerable to hostile ""hijackings"" as  airlines are; and  that what was at  stake in Grenada was not just an air field or a Soviet/Cuban arms depot,  but the very safety of the other mini States of the region.  I would like to second his hope ""that  the British  and American Govern ments can join with those Caribbean  States that feel the need for protec tion in discussing together the ground  rules  for sensible defense  insurance  agreements  to  provide  the  smaller  States with some protection against  the threat of random assaults.""  Mr. Speaker, I insert the full text of  Sir Philip's letter in the RECORD:  London SWIA OAA, October 31, 1983.  HOUSE OF COIDIONS,  The EDITOR,  The New York Timu,  New York. N.Y.  Sm: In the past twenty years, Great Brit ain has given full independence to nearly  twenty mini-States-some with a population  of less  than 100,000-which cannot make  31891  adequate provision for their own defence.  Indeed, it is arguable that these very small  countries should not even try to maintain  armed  forces of any size, as  this would  absorb too much of the scarce resources at  their command.  The absence of adequate defences means  that these mini-States are almost as vulner able to hi-jacking as airliners are. Within  the British Commonwealth in the last six  years, the Governments of Grenada and the  Seychelles were successfully hi jacked by  armed forces  that were not much  larger  than a regular army platoon, while the at tempted hi-jacking of the Gambia was pre vented by  the  fortuitous presence of  a  couple of British Special Air Service soldiers  followed by the intervention of the Senegal ese Army.  It is not surprising,  therefore,  that the  mini-States of the Eastern Caribbean, such  as Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent,  should have asked my country and  the  United States  to  intervene  following  the  second coup in Grenada. What was at stake  was not just ""another Caribbean airfield, an  auxiliary station for smallarms transfers  and a modest source of new recruits for  international mischief"", as you suggest in  your leading article, ""America as Goliath""  <October 30), but the safety of other mini States.  As a British Member of Parliament and as  a former Under Secretary of State at the  Ministry of Defence under Mrs. Thatcher, I  am sorry that my Government did not feel  able  to  join with  the United States and  some of our Caribbean Commonwealth part ners in providing a relief force. The Prime  Minister of Barbados and his colleagues un derstood that failure to act in Grenada after  the recent murders would have greatly in creased the chances of similar assaults in  other islands.  The French have generally concluded de fence agreements with their former colonies  which have provided the independent Fran cophone States with a measure of protec tion  against  casual  assault. Perhaps we  should learn from the French.  When the Grenada operation is complet ed, and when diplomatic tensions have been  reduced, I hope that the British and Ameri can Governments can join with those Carib bean States that feel the need for protec tion, in discussing together the ground rules  for sensible defence ensurance agreements,  to provide the smaller States with some pro tection against the threat of random as saults.  Yours sincerely,  SIR PHlLIP GooDHART,  Member of Parliament.   H.R. 4295  HON. MARK D. SIIJANDER  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 9, 1983  ",1983
405,,98,0.406,1519,22,Mr. SILJANDER.," Mr. Speaker, the  debate over the Universal Telephone  Service Preservation Act of 1983 <H.R.  4295 > has caused a great deal of confu sion over the issue of access charges.  Today's Wall Street Journal carried an  article which I believe gives an objec tive analysis of the issue. I recommend  that my colleagues read it before cast",1983
