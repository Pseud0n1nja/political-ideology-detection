1,41,3,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  to  introduce a bill which  would amend  title 38 of  the United  States Code to authorize eligible veter ans  to  receive  reimbursement  for  chiropractic services  received  in cer tain circumstances through the Veter ans' Administration medical care pro gram.  Under current law, the VA has the  authority to provide chiropractic serv ices to veterans and any VA physician  may, on a case-by-case basis, refer an  eligible veteran to a chiropractor for  treatment.  Despite  this  authority,  only a few, if any, veterans have ever  been ref erred by VA physicians to a  chiropractor at VA expense.  Mr. President, I believe our Nation's  veterans deserve  the same access  to  medical  treatment,  including  chiro practic treatment, as do recipients of  other Federal and State health care  programs, many of which now provide  chiropractic treatment to their benefi ciaries. It is time that the V A's policy  and practice be brought more in line  with  these programs. For  instance,  under the medicare program which is  administered by  the Department of  Health and Human Services, it is typi cal  for  eligible persons  in need of  chiropractic care  to seek and obtain  the services of a doctor of chiropractic  and to receive reimbursement for such  services  from HHS. Reimbursement  for chiropractic services  is also cur rently provided under the Federal Em ployees  Compensation Act  and  a  number of States include chiropractic  services under their medical assistance  programs.  Mr. President, the legislation which  I propose today is nearly identical to  S. 1956, a bill which I introduced and  which was  passed  by  the  Senate  during the 97th Congress. It will es tablish a pilot program to compel the  use of chiropractors within the VA. It  limits the number of veterans who are  eligible for its benefits and also limits  total  expenditures  for  chiropractic  services under the pilot program to $2  million in any fiscal year. Unless ex tended, the program as proposed will  expire on September 30, 1986.  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me  say that while the House has, on two  occasions, rejected this Senate-passed  pilot program, it has joined the Senate  in strongly urging  the V A's Depart ment of Medicine and Surgery to re evaluate its position and to use its ex isting authorities to provide, at least  on a pilot basis, chiropractic services  in appropriate cases as part of the hos pital  care  or medical  services  fur nished to veterans. This message was  ignored by the VA. I, therefore, urge  Congress to send a stronger message  to the VA on this matter by favorably  considering this bill.  Mr. President, I send the bill to the  desk and ask that it be referred to the  appropriate  committee  for  prompt  consideration, and  I  ask unanimous  consent  that  it be printed  in  the  RECORD at the conclusion of my  re marks.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.567  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That <a>  section 601 of title 38, United States Code, is  amended by adding at the end thereof the  following new paragraph:  ""(9)  The  term  'chiropractic  services'  means  the manual manipulation of  the  spine performed by a chiropractor <who is  licensed as such by the State in which he or  she performs such services and who meets  the uniform minimum standards promulgat ed for chiropractors under section 1861<r)(5)  of  the  Social  Security Act  <42  U.S.C.  1395x(r)(5))) to correct a subluxation of the  spine. For the purposes of this paragraph,  such term does not include physical exami nations, laboratory tests, radiologic services,  or other tests or services determined by the  Administrator to be excluded."".

2,80,3,Mr.  HELMS.," Mr.  President,  I  wonder if Senators noted an article in  the August issue of Reader's Digest,  entitled, ""Sign Up-Or Else!""  The article describes a situation in  which New York union officials used  violence and coercion in a campaign of  terror to force a successful electronics  company into bankruptcy.  The owner and employees of  the  company would have been unable to  resist this terror in the courts if not  for  a  charitable  legal  organization  based in Springfield, Va.  I applaud the noble efforts on behalf  of  the workers  taken up by Steve  Antosh and the Center on National  Labor Policy, an outstanding charita ble legal foundation located in Spring field, Va.  The  Elector-Harmonix  case  is  a  grim, forceful reminder to us all. Only  when union officials are held responsi ble for their acts of intimidation and  violence can workers truly enjoy the  freedom  to  pursue  the American  dream.  Mr. President, I ask that the article  be printed in the RECORD.  ""SIGN UP-OR ELSE!""  <By Randy Fitzgerald)  With $1000 he had saved as an electrical  engineer, 26-year-old Mike Matthews found ed Electro-Harmonix, Inc., in 1968. The firm  designed and manufactured electronic musi cal instruments and accessories. First-year  sales amounted  to only $50,000, but  ten  years  later  they had reached $5 million.  Electro employed 150 persons, nearly all of  them black, Hispanic or Asian.  Mike Matthews was a fair-minded employ er who cared  for his workers. Although  most of them began on an assembly line at  the minimum wage, they had unlimited op portunities to advance. For example, Willie  Magee, a 38-year-old black, worked his way  up from unskilled laborer to vice president  of sales at an annual salary of $51,000. And  Manny Zapata, a Spanish immigrant who  spoke no English when he arrived at the  company, became director of foreign mar keting.  All the technicians who worked with the  oscilloscopes,  voltmeters  and  generators  that  tested Electro's complex  electronic  products had started out with the company  as  unskilled  laborers. Dozens  of  others  moved up to bookkeeping and office posi tions while receiving on-the-job training.  Matthews  created  an  environment  in  which  unskilled  people  could  become  skilled, productive citizens. His philosophy:  workers  should advance by merit  rather  than by seniority. In 1978 Matthews was  named New York State Small Business  Person of the Year.  The award apparently attracted the atten tion of the Plastic, Moulders' and Novelty  Workers' Union, Local 132 of the Interna tional Ladies' Garment Workers' Union  CILGWU). Within weeks, a union official  called and said he wanted Matthews to in stall a union shop  in which all workers  would have to join the ILGWU. ""It won't  cost you a dime,"" Matthews was  told. ""In  fact, you can save money.""  Matthews rejected the overture. To per suade  employees  to  sign  ILGWU  cards,  union organizers stationed themselves out side  the company's small  loft factory on  New York City's West 23rd Street. They  made little headway. After a few weeks the  organizers withdrew in defeat, claiming that  Matthews had frightened his workers into  opposing the union.  Actually,  the organizers  failed  because  Matthews had a  remarkable rapport with  his employees. Everyone addressed him by  his first name, cracking jokes and kidding  him as he walked through the factory. Mat thews organized parties and outings for his  workers. On two occasions he closed down  the  factory,  rented buses  and  took  the  entire work  force  to Long  Island  for  a  picnic. He provided his employees with med ical benefits and paid vacations. They recip rocated with affection and loyalty.  Three years after the first organizing at tempt,  the union  returned. Alleging  that  Matthews was abusing  the exploiting mi norities, organizers distributed union cards  to the Electro employees. To call a repre sentative election, signatures were needed  from at  least 30  percent of Matthews's  workers. After a week, fewer than a dozen  cards had been returned. Once again the  union faced an embarrassing rejection.  On Monday, August 10, 1981, a  raucous  crowd of about 50 people assembled in front  of Electro. As Matthews approached  the  building's entrance, he was accosted by five  toughs. One slugged him in the face, an other two pulled at him from behind, while  two  others  kicked  him.  As  employees  emerged from the subways in the morning,  they were confronted and offered money for  lunch, and then asked to sign union cards. If  they refused, they were pelted with eggs or  threatened with fists and clubs. Pho Kham,  a 20-year-old Laotian refugee who had es caped communist  tyranny a year earlier,  was warned, ""Sign up or you'll go to a hospi tal!"" Ecuador-born Fausto Quevedo, 48, was  told by an organizer that if he did not sup port the union, he would be shot in the legs.  Employees trying to enter the building had  to run a gauntlet of shoving, kicking, punch ing and screaming organizers the union had  sent in. Even though police arrived to set up  barricades, only about 20 of Matthews's employees were able to get inside. Production  came to virtual standstill.  For the rest of the week employees were  threathened and taunted as they tried to  report  for work. On his way home one  evening Steve Griffin, 25, was ambushed by  four union thugs and struck over the head  with a bottle. On another night union van dals crept into the building and poured glue  into door and elevator locks.  The following week the union's campaign  of terror resumed in full force. When he left  work at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, August 18, cus tomer-service  representative Geoff Becker  was accosted by several union goons. One of  them slammed a fist into the side of Beck er's face, knocking him unconscious. For six  weeks after the attack Becker experienced  horrible headaches, until a brain operation,  to remove a blood clot caused by the blow,  relieved the pressure inside his head.  By Wednesday Electro's labor force had  been reduced  to a handful of frightened,  angry workers. Since police were unable to  assure Matthews that his workers could be  protected beyond  the plant entrance, he  closed the company and sent his employees  home.  On Thursday morning, after a TV report  the previous evening had shown union orga nizers  involved  in violent acts, police as signed additional officers to the area. The  next day Matthews and about 60 of his em ployees  assembled  at  the Fifth Avenue  subway entrance and marched to Electro in  open defiance of the pickets. They were now  more determined than ever to survive the  union campaign of terror.  Over this period of picketing and harass ment, Matthews and his work  force had  maintained high morale in the face of accu mulating financial problems heightened by  the union's disruptive  tactics. And  then,  convinced  that Electro could not survive,  the Philadelphia  lender  that had backed  Matthews withdrew  its funding.  It was a  savage blow. Faced with a  credit cutoff,  Matthews searched desperately for other fi nancial backing. He did not find it.  On August 25,  just as suddenly as they  had appeared,  the union organizers were  gone, ending three weeks of abuse and hoo liganism. But not before seven of them had  been arrested on charges including assault,  disorderly conduct and harassment. <The  charges  have  since  been  dismissed.)  seemed to Matthews that the union had in tentionally set out  to bankrupt him and  make unemployment statistics of his work ers.  For the next five months Matthews and  about 40 employees hung on valiantly in an  effort to save the company and their jobs.  Even when he fell  four weeks behind on  their wages, his employees kept reporting  for work, determined to stand by Matthews  in his hour of need.  On January 18, 1982, the National Labor  Relations Board ordered the union to ""cease  and desist"" from threatening employees of  Electro-Harmonix, inflicting physical harm  upon them, or giving them money in return  for their signatures on union cards.  But this condemnation of union violence  and coercion was too little and too late to  help Mike Matthews and his employees.  Electro-Harmonix had been without phone  service or electricity for over three months,  the workers toiling by candlelight. The em ployees, like Mike Matthews himself, were  broke.  A week after the board's ruling, Matthews  held a tearful farewell party with his emIt  ",1983

5,93,3,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  when  I  suggested  the absence of a  quorum, I was in the midst of reading  the remarks of Mr. Thomas Campbell,  the head of the Bureau of Competi tion, speaking on behalf of the Federal  Trade Commission before the Judici ary Committee of the Senate.  Said Mr. Campbell to our committee:  A more competitive model would be desir able, and feasible. But the regime of tariff  filing and enforcement that S. 47 would per petuate promotes neither competition nor  consumer and shipper welfare. It would not  be revolution, but only healthy reform, to  eliminate these unmistakably anticompeti tive Government intrusions into the mar ketplace.  The major themes supporting this legisla tion are ending excessive Government regu lation and making U.S. law consistent with  the practices of other nations. Continuing  the FMC's pervasive  regulation of  tariff  filing and enforcement of cartel agreements  would seem to contradict both of these im portant purposes.  INTERCONFERENCE AGREEMENTS AND  CONFERENCE-PRESCRIBED JOINT THROUGH RATES  Intermodal transportation is an important  and valuable technological innovation. Re duced regulation of motor carriers and rail roads has stimulated competition in the de velopment of efficient and innovative inter modal means of transport. It is important to  prevent ocean liner conferences from damp ening those competitive incentives and from  attempting to extend their monopoly power  into competitive domestic markets.  Individual ocean carriers should be free to  quote through rates and to negotiate such  rates with inland carriers. But S. 47 would  also allow joint through rates to be set by  conference  agreement.  Through  such  agreed-upon uniform rates, the conferences  may well be able to extend their monopoly  position. Shippers or inland carriers may re ceive few of the savings from intermodal ef ficiencies; those savings would pass, as mo nopoly rents, to the cartel.  Allowing liner conferences, through joint  agreements  for  intermodal  transportation,  to impose the ""dead hand"" of monopoly on  areas of the trucking and rail industry is at  odds with recent bipartisan-and widely ap plauded-legislation. The Staggers Rail Act,  the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and the air line  deregulation  legislation  constituted  major milestones in the effort to encourage  lower prices and  innovation  in  industries  which, for too long, had remained encrusted  with pervasive regulation. It would be ironic  indeed if, in the name of ""deregulation"" of  ocean shipping, we were to supplant Gov ernment regulation of land transport with  monopoly abuse by cartels.  Competitive problems raised by intermod al  technologies  are  recognized,  and  ad dressed to some extent, in the bill. In many  ways, the bill tries to preserve competitive  alternatives  in  inland  transportation. All  these means-prohibiting conference bar gaining with inland carriers, applying anti trust penalties to agreements with inland  carriers, and to agreements between ocean  carriers on  the division of  through rates  with inland carriers, and requiring optional  port-to-port  loyalty contracts-would help  to prevent some possible competitive abuses.  But they would not eliminate completely  the conference cartels' potential monopoly  power over inland shippers and carriers.  S. 47 would also permit agreements be tween conferences and between carriers in  different  conferences.  Agreements  that  ",1983

7,145,3,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my  colleagues an article from the Wash ington Post on February 20, which  marks  the beginning of an era  in  which nuclear war becomes even more  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  likely. India, the article explains, has  become the first developing country to  begin accumulating sizable stockpiles  of separated plutionium, and doing so  at a rate that would enable it to build  about 20 atomic bombs a year! The sig nificance of this much dreaded event  must not escape us.  I hope that my colleagues will give  some thought to this development and  to the horrors which could ensue. We  must realize that now the importance  of making substantial progress in the  arms reduction talks with the Soviet  Union increases greatly. For only if we  show our commitment in this arena  can we be respected and serve as an  example when we push other nations  in the same direction. I urge my col leagues to take the time to read the  article which follows.  INDIA STORING ARMS-GRADE PLUTONIUM  <By Milton R. Benjamin)  India has become  the  first  developing  country to begin stockpiling separated plu tonium at a  rate that would enable it to  build about 20 atomic bombs a year if it de cides to pursue a nuclear weapons program,  according to U.S. and international sources.  The process of separating the plutonium  from burned-up  fuel produced by  Indian  atomic power plants is taking place at the  Tarapur reprocessing facility near Bombay,  which went into large-scale operation last  November, according  to  the International  Atomic Energy Agency <IAEA>.  Previously, the plant only had been used  to  reprocess small amounts of spent fuel  from research reactors.  According to IAEA officials, the separated  plutonium is being kept in a storage room  there where it will be held until Indian offi cials decide its use. Indian atomic energy of ficials  said yesterday  that  the plutonium  might fuel an experimental fast-breeder re actor, which itself would produce additional  plutonium.  The significance of large-scale reprocess ing in India, however, is that it marks the  beginning of the era that has long worried  nuclear nonproliferation experts-the time  when nations without nuclear arsenals start  accumulating sizable stockpiles of separated  plutonium.  ""There simply is no reason connected to  their civilian power programs why any of  these countries need  to begin stockpiling  separated plutonium in this decade,"" a U.S.  government official said. ""It makes no sense  in an atomic power context at all."" Until  now, virtually all of the plutonium produced  in atomic power plants in developing coun tries has remained part of the highly radio active spent fuel.  The plutonium  stored  in  this way  in  spent-fuel pools in several dozen countries is  not easily accessible.  If a nation decided to use such plutonium  to build nuclear weapons, it first would have  to construct a  reprocessing plant, which  would take at least two years.  But is a country has a stockpile of sepa rated plutonium,  the  temptation  to build  nuclear weapons in a time of crisis might in crease greatly. A country that already had  done weapons-design work might be able to  fabricate separated plutonium into bombs in  a matter of weeks, or perhaps days.  The fact that India is beginning to stock pile large amounts of separated plutonium  is certain to increase apprehension in neigh2869  boring Pakistan, where U.S. analysts believe  the government is attempting to develop a  nuclear weapons capability.  India has stated that it does not plan to  build nuclear weapons.  But the atomic device exploded by India  in 1974 was made from plutonium. So if New  Delhi decided in response to developments  in Pakistan or  for other reasons  that  it  needed  a nuclear arsenal,  it presumably  could turn a stockpile of separated plutoni um into weapons in a relatively short time.  The spent fuel being run through the Tar apur reprocessing plant, located about half  a mile from the U.S.-built Tarapur atomic  power  station,  is  from  the Canadian-de signed Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant l, ac cording to IAEA officials.  At  the moment,  two agency  inspectors  with a mandate to keep track of the plutoni um and sound a warning if any is diverted  for military use are observing  the entire  Tarapur reprocessing operation.  But agency inspectors will not be permit ted to observe all of Tarapur's reprocessing  runs in the months ahead, since India re fuses to place the plant under full interna tional safeguards. Only plutonium subject  international  control  because  of  specific  agreements between India and foreign gov ernments will be monitored.  The IAEA also has not decided whether to  keep the separated plutonium for which it is  responsible under ""continuous inspection,""  or simply  to check on  it ""perhaps every  second week,"" officials said.  The Tarapur facility is designed to reproc ess 100 tons of spent fuel annually, so if it  operated at full capacity-highly unlikely  since commercial  reprocessing plants  fre quently encounter problems-it would be  able to separate 135 to 150 kilograms of plu tonium per year. <A kilogram equals 2.2  pounds.) Six  to 8 kilograms of plutonium  are needed for a nuclear weapon.  The ability to separate plutonium on this  large a scale puts India far ahead of Paki stan, which has built but not yet begun to  operate a much smaller reprocessing plant  next to the Pakistan Institute for Nuclear  Science and Technology on the outskirts of  Islamabad.  It also puts India well ahead of countries  such as Argentina and Brazil, which have  laboratory-scale  reprocessing  facilities  where years might be required to separate  enough  plutonium  for  a  single  nuclear  weapon.  But Pakistan is trying to complete a re processing plant even larger than Tarapur  from a French design; Argentina is building  a  reprocessing facility  that could produce  significant  quantities  of  plutonium,  and  West Germany  is helping Brazil design a  plant.  The only non-nuclear weapons country  other than India operating a commercial size reprocessing plant and stockpiling large  quantities of separated plutonium is Japan,  which has a larger and far more advanced  civilian atomic energy program than India.  It is estimated that Japan has 500 kilo grams of separated plutonium stored at its  Tokai reprocessing plant, according to U.S.  sources. But Japan is operating a breeder  that requires 180 kilograms of plutonium a  year and has an atomic power research pro gram that requires 145 more kilograms of  plutonium per year.  India, by comparison, has said it ultimate ly will need 50 kilograms of plutonium to  fuel a small experimental breeder reactor  being built at Kalpakkam near Madras. Yet  its reprocessing plant is capable of turning  ",1983
8,158,3,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, on  February 26, Rev. Konstantine Tsigas  will be honored by his friends for his  many years of service at St. Andrew's  Greek Orthodox Church in Randolph,  N.J. He has been an inspiration to all  who know him and has worked tire lessly  to bring his congregation  the  message of God.  Reverend Tsigas grew up in the vil lage of Sitarlona in Greece, and it is  there that he was inspired to preach  the Gospel. In 1953, he went to the  University  of  Athens  Theological  School and, in November 1962, was or dained a priest in the Greek Orthodox  Church. Just 1 month later, he, his  lovely wife, Spiridoula, and his chilEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dren sailed on an ocean liner to this  country in order to spread the faith to  Greek  immigrants  in America. The  people of St. Andrew's wisely knew a  good man when  they saw one, and  asked the Reverend to be the priest  for their church.  The church  serves  all of Morris,  Sussex, Warren, and parts of Somerset  Counties and has grown from 75 fami lies to nearly 400, a testimony both to  the ability of Reverend Tsigas and the  love and concern which exudes from  the  congregation. The  church was  originally  located  in Dover, but the  amazing growth of the congregation  led to a new, larger home in Randolph,  built in 1975.  Since Reverend Tsigas  is  the only  Greek Orthodox priest in the area, he  drives more than 3,000 miles a week to  care  for  the needs of  those people  under his attentive watch. His devo tion  to  the service of God and the  Greek community is reflected  in his  commitment to his daily work and re sponsibilities.  As an American, Reverend Tsigas  can testify to the value of our consti tutional right to religious freedom. He  bravely fought the advance of Hilter  as  an  officer  in  the Greek Army  during the Nazi occupation in World  War  II,  and during  the attempted  Communist seizure of power during  the Greek civil war.  I am pleased to share with my col leagues the valuable contributions this  Greek immigrant and his family have  made to the people of northern New  Jersey. I  join St. Andrew's Church in  honoring  this man  revered  for his  wisdom and compassion for his fellow  man. My best wishes  to Reverend  Tsigas, his wife, Spiridoula, and their  three  children, Demetrios, Vasiliki,  and Kathryn, so that he might contin ue his life's work with all God's bless ings.   ILLINOIS VALLEY: HUSTLING  FOR JOBS  HON. TOM CORCORAN  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 23, 1983  e ",1983
9,158,3,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, the  people of my home county of La Salle  in north central Illinois have been suf fering since 1979 from rates of unem ployment substantially above the na tional average. Back home, the impor tance of assisting small businesses to  the creation of new jobs is well-recog nized, as  is discussed  in a  report on  several meritorious efforts  there by  the Chicago Tribune's veteran colum nist, Bob Wiedrich. One of Mr. Wied rich's continuing themes, in addition  to the shortcomings of congressional  operations,  is  the  low  return  in ex penditures of  tax dollars  Illinoisans  February 23, 1983  send to Washington. Though he does  not mention Illinois Valley citizens' ef forts to improve that situation, it was  my pleasure to recently participate in  the announcement of Federal discre tionary  bridge  funding  for  the La  Salle-Peru Bridge-the result of an other combined effort by valley resi dents.  My colleagues may well find this ac count of local cooperation in pursuit  of employment opportunities and a  better life to include ideas which can  be  applied  in  their districts, and  I  therefore insert it in the RECORD.  [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 22, 19831  WE ARE HUNGARY FOR JOBS  LA SALLE,  ILL.-""We're hungry for  jobs,""  the Downstate chamber of commerce offi cial declared. ""And when you're hungry, you  get out and hustle.""  ""You don't really have to go out of state  to find people who care about small busi ness,"" wrote Leonard J. Corti, the chamber  of commerce executive director from Down state La Salle. ""One can find a very healthy  attitude in the Illinois Valley.""  I accepted Corti's invitation to visit that  region of north central Illinois, about a hun dred miles southwest of Chicago along Hwy.  80, and what I found was an amalgam of  business, labor and elected leaders working  to overcome the ravages of 16.8 percent un employment brought on by recession and  the successful recruiting efforts of Sun Belt  states.  ""The community decided  that it wasn't  going to get big employers like Ford or Gen eral Motors to come in and solve our unem ployment problems,'' said Mayor Don Baker  of Peru, La Salle's sister city along the Illi nois River.  ""So we decided  to settle  for  many small companies with as few as six or  eight employees on which to build a firm in dustrial tax base.""  Judging by the growth statistics, the game  plan is working. In the last five years, the Il linois Valley, with 140,000  residents, has  become home to 15 new light manufactur ing ventures, some with as few as 6 to 10  employees, for a  total of 1,000  jobs. Their  combined payrolls represent $18 million a  year.  And complementing those are the reloca tions of five major  trucking  lines  to  the  valley that employ 700 people, for a  total  annual payroll of $22.5 million. The new  ventures have helped boost sagging  real  estate and sales tax revenues. They have  provided jobs.  More important, they have offered hope  to people whose economy was devastated  when  the valley's single  largest employer  started closing its doors five years ago for a  move to Alabama.  Westclox, a company that had been in the  La Salle-Peru area for almost a hundred  years, finally closed its doors in 1980. At its  peak, the firm employed 5,000.  Worse, as the recession has deepened, the  valley has been losing an increasing number  of its most talented young people. About 80  percent of those who go to college do not  return. And what makes that figure even  more staggering is the fact that more than  50 percent of all high school graduates go to  college.  Community leaders are moving to mini mize traditional dependence on a handful of  major employers by seeking greater diversi ty of smaller industries.  ",1983
10,171,3,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, if there  is any one thing that is absolutely es sential that we  learn coming out of  our experiences with the Environmen tal Protection Agency  and  all  the  problems that we have been having, it  is simply that as long as we continue  to dispose of toxic hazardous waste in  the ground or on the ground, we are  going  to continue  to have problems  with any administration and with any  agency in trying to delicately balance  all the interests that are concerned.  I will be introducing legislation this  morning which will, within 5 years,  completely eliminate all land disposal  of toxic hazardous waste. The legisla tion would also immediately after its  enactment eliminate the use of landfill  disposal of hazardous wastes if the ad ministration can certify that there are  other means of  treating  these  toxic  hazardous wastes such as incineration,  such as neutralization, such as chemi cal destruction, such as  thermal de struction.  There are numerous other ways that  we should be handling toxic chemical  wastes other than sticking them in the  ground or on the ground.  I would urge my colleagues to look  at this legislation and consider cospon soring it.  PERMISSION  FOR  COMMITTEE  ON THE  JUDICIARY TO FILE  REPORT ON H.R. 3, PROVIDING  FOR  APPOINTMENT  OF  UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY  JUDGES  ",1983
11,171,3,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent that the Commit tee on the Judiciary may have until  midnight tonight, February 24, 1983,  to file a report on the bill <H.R. 3) to  provide for the appointment of United  States bankruptcy judges under article  III of the Constitution, and for other  purposes.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore <Mr.  PENNY).  Is there objection to the re quest of  the gentleman  from New  York?  There was no objection.  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT  BOND LIMITATION ACT  <Mr. PICKLE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
12,171,3,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, the pur pose of my asking for a special order  today is to discuss with this body a bill  that  I have  introduced  today, H.R.  1635, which is called the Industrial De velopment Bond Limitation Act.  This bill places meaning! ul restric tions on the use of tax exempt, private  purpose industrial development bonds  and is  intended to help prevent fur ther erosions of the value of public  purpose municipal bonds used  to fiof  nance  the  traditional  functions  State and local governments.  This is a very serious matter which  affects  the American people, and  I  hope that the Members will be privi leged  to hear my  remarks and  to  notice in the RECORD also a copy of the  bill which is being requested for publi cation.  MUGGING LOW-INCOME  WORKERS  <Mr. PETRI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
13,171,3,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, the Presi dent's opponents claim  they are for  the little guy. But look at what some  of  them want  to do-they want  to  eliminate tax indexing, which  is  the  best  protection  low-income workers  have against higher taxes.  Without  tax  indexing,  inflation  causes  taxes  to go  up by pushing  people into higher tax brackets. The  tax-and-spend crew in Congress likes  this because  it means higher  taxes  without the embarrassment of having  to vote for them.  Because of  the bracket creep,  for  every 1 percent of inflation, the Feder al Government's  income  tax  collec tions go up 1.6 percent; 1 percent of  that  figure  keeps  the Government  even with inflation, but the extra 0.6  percent is a windfall for the Govern ment-a windfall at the expense of the  taxpayers who lose purchasing power  even  though  their pretax wages are  only keeping pace with price increases.  The indexing law which is scheduled  to go into effect in 1985 is designed to  stop this mugging of the taxpayers.  Who benefits from  indexing? It is  the guy with a  low  income, not the  rich. The tax brackets are narrowest  at the low end of the scale, and the  rich are already in the highest brack et, so it is those who are hurting the  most who find themselves paying more  as a result of bracket creep.  Why,  then, do  the ""friends of the  poor""  in  this Congress want  to do  away with indexing? Such legislators  are addicted to high spending policies.  For them, raising taxes  takes prece dence over most everything else.  TO REPEAL SECTION 311 OF THE  FEDERAL  PUBLIC  TRANSPOR TATION ACT OF 1982  ",1983
14,171,3,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask  unanimous consent that the Commit tee on Public Works and Transporta tion be discharged from further con sideration of the bill <H.R. 1572)  to  repeal  section  311  of  the Federal  Public Transportation Act of 1982, and  ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  Is  The SPEAKER  pro  tempare.  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?  ",1983
15,171,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I re serve the right to object.  ",1983
16,171,3,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
17,171,3,Mr. GINGRICH., I yield to my col league from Georgia.  ,1983
18,171,3,Mr. LEVITAS.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this leg islation,  which  is  cosponsored  by  myself, the gentleman from Georgia,  and the other gentleman from Geor gia,  is to repeal a provision that was  written into the Surf ace Transporta tion Act passed in December of last  year, which provision likewise was put  into that legislation by the two gentle men from Georgia dealing with  the  matter of  the Metropolitan Atlanta  Rapid Transit Authority  to  assure  that the State government and local  officials  could make  some decisions  concerning the direction of the rapid  transit line.  That action has been effected now.  The purpose of the amendment has  been very well served and we are seek ing by this action to repeal that provi sion so that the compromise reached  in the Georgia Legislature may go for ward.  ",1983
19,171,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," Further reserving  the right to object, Mr. Speaker, would  the gentleman agree that this lays the  base for the successful completion of a  complete rail system from the airport  to downtown and the opportunity for  both De Kalb County, which has more  than amply paid its fair share, and the  airport, which is the economic center  of our region, to be adequately served?  ",1983
20,171,3,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker,  if the  gentleman will yield further, the gen tleman is absolutely correct. The ar rangements which have now been har moniously reached will serve the best  interests not only of those citizens in  De Kalb County, Ga., whom I repre sent, by getting the rapid transit line  further out into that area at a much  earlier time, but also serve the needs  of the entire State of Georgia and the  Metropolitan Atlanta area by insuring  adequate  rapid  rail  transportation  from the magnificent, beautiful, large  Atlanta Airport serving not only At lanta, Ga., the South, but the Nation  and the world.  e ",1983

24,197,3,Mr.  BUMPERS.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation to  replace the current system for issuing  oil and gas  leases on Federal  lands  with an all-competitive  system. The  legislation is identical to the proposal  which I  introduced in the past Con gress,  and  to  legislation which  the  Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee approved in the 96th Con gress.  The legislation is based upon several  premises. First, issuance of Federal oil  and gas leases constitutes an award of  valuable Government property  that  should be made on a competitive basis  in order to assure the public of a fair  price. Second,  the rights  to develop  energy resources which belong to the  taxpayers  should  not  be  awarded  through a system which invites fraud  and speculation. Third, replacing the  existing lottery system for awarding  leases with an all-competitive bidding  system would generate additional reve nues, promote diligent development of  leases, and simplify leasing procedures  to encourage rapid development of oil  and gas on Federal lands.  Mr. President, every Member of the  Senate is aware of my strong opposi tion to the way in which our federally  owned oil and gas reserves are leased. I  first became aware of the Interior De partment's leasing procedures in 1979,  when 33,000 acres near producing gas  wells  at Fort Chaffee, Ark., were  leased noncompetitively  for only $1  per acre. But  the situation at Fort  Chaffee is not unique. In many areas,  ",1983
25,223,3,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President,  Tuesday,  the U.S.  Supreme Court  ruled that a driver's refusal to submit  to a blood alcohol test can be intro duced as evidence against him at a  trial on drunk driving charges. This  decision gives local prosecutors yet an other weapon  in  the  fight  against  drunk driving, which, in the words of  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ""occurs  with tragic frequency on our Nation's  highways.""  I commend the Court's action. Tues day's decision, South Dakota against  Neville, recognizes that the decision to  drive or not to drive is one of choice,  and that our judicial processes should  work in ways that hold individuals re sponsible for their free actions.  Mr. President, I hope Congress will  use the occasion of this landmark deci sion  to put  its own house  in order.  Today there exists an unconscionable  loophole  in  the bankruptcy  statute  which makes  it possible  for drunk  drivers who have  injured, killed, or  caused property damage to others to  escape civil liability for their actions  by having  their  judgment debt dis charged in Federal bankruptcy court.  This  loophole  affords  opportunities  for scandalous abuse of judicial proc esses.  Imagine the heartbreak of a parent  who has been notified that his or her  child has been killed or permanently  disabled by some fellow weaving down  the road, intoxicated and totally obliv ious to the danger he poses to others.  Then  imagine  these distraught par ents  losing whatever  compensation  they have recovered for their loss be cause the drunk driver has turned to  the Federal bankruptcy court system  and has had his liability discharged.  Or, imagine the hardship on children  who lose a father, a mother, or per haps both to a drunk driver who  is  then relieved of his debt. Unfortunate ly, these are not simply hypothetical  possibilities. The bankruptcy process   ",1983

There are many proposals now pend ing before this Congress to provide as sistance to the unemployed. It is cer tainly a problem of such critical di mensions,  that we  can  never  do  enough to alleviate the problem. But  we must try.  The  administration  has  projected  unemployment levels above 10 percent  for  the remainder of  this year, and  near that for the next 2 years. It is not  that people are not  trying  to  find  work; they are and the media is full of  examples-20,000 people in Milwaukee  lined up in January for 200 jobs; 2,000  people in Peoria lined up for 100 jobs;  30,000  people  in Chicago  lined  up  for 2,000 jobs. The list is endless.  People are doing without the basic  necessities,  losing  everything  they  have worked  their whole  lives  to  obtain; standing in line for hours to  get a pound of cheese or a single stick  of butter; losing their homes; keeping  their heat  turned off because  they  cannot afford the utility bills; neglect ing medical care for  themselves and  their children because they no longer  have issurance and do not qualify for  medicaid.

29,262,3,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, my col league the senior Senator from Illinois  recently addressed  the  Illinois Mine  Workers Legislative Conference on the  problems of the high sulfur coal indus try and the need to assure the future  of midwestern  coal. Senator PERCY  finds that the impact of proposed acid  rain legislation is as severe for Illinois  as it is for Indiana and other midwest ern  coal-producing  States.  Senator  PERCY points out that the acid rain  legislation proposed last year by the  Senate Committee  on Environment  and Public Works may have no impact  on acid rain problems in the most sen sitive areas while a  liming program  would provide immediate relief, relief  which is needed until scientific knowl edge advances far enough to suggest a  reasonable solution  to  the acid  rain  problem.  The  Subcommittee  on  Energy,  Nuclear  Proliferation  and  Government Processes has  also  re leased  two  valuable  studies of  the  impact of this proposed legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of Senator PERCY'S speech and  the  studies. by  the Department of  Energy  and  the Congressional Re search  Service  be  printed  in  the  RECORD  for  the benefit of my col leagues.  The material follows:  ADDRESS OF SENATOR CHARLES H. PERCY  Rich Trumka, John Banovic, Leroy Bauer,  Joe Angleton, Jerry Hawkins, and my mine  workers friends. I deeply appreciate your in viting me here today to address this Annual  Legislative Conference of the United Mine  Workers of America.  Since the topic of your conference is legis lation, let me begin by just mentioning one  piece of legislation which I feel will adverse ly affect not  just mine workers, but all  Americans who work and strive to save and  invest for their financial futures.  Last  summer,  the Congress decided  it  would be a good thing to begin withholding  Federal income taxes on both interest and  dividend  income. In the Senate, that par ticular provision passed on a close vote of 50  to 48. I am proud of the fact that I was one  of the 48 Senators who opposed this provi sion. It runs counter to all of the things we  have been trying to do in order to stimulate  more personal savings.  I wanted to tell all of you who have taken  the time to write your elected representa tives in Washington about this matter that  your message is being heard loud and clear.  In the last four weeks, my office alone has  received over 200,000 cards and letters on  this  issue-more mail  than on any other  single issue in the entire time I have been in  the Senate. More mail on withholding than  on Watergate, Vietnam, the Panama Canal,  and even labor law reform. I have already  introduced  legislation  to  repeal  this  law.  Keep those cards and letters coming in until  it's taken off the books!  I certainly do not need to tell you about  the troubles faced by Illinois miners. Thirty  percent of our miners are out of work-5,000  miners out of a work force of 16,000. Domes tic and international markets for our coal  are sluggish, despite a good price and our  best efforts to promote exports. Non-unionized Western coal continues to make inroads  into  the  traditional markets for our coal.  And  acid  rain  legislation  in Washington  poses a significant threat to the Illinois coal  industry.  I am not pleased with the present condi tions for Illinois mine workers, and I know  you aren't. Your challenge and mine is to  see what we can do about it. There are some  important and meaningful things that we  can do. There are some things we should  not do.  Illinois  is  the  ""Saudi Arabia"" of coal.  There are an estimated 162 billion tons of  identifiable and recoverable coal reserves in  Illinois-enough coal to provide centuries of  power to American and foreign consumers.  We must not permit Illinois coal to be lost  as a national energy asset.  We are not going to let the Federal Gov ernment turn its back on important funding  for fossil fuel research and development. I  will vigorously fight the Office of Manage ment and Budget's proposal to slash by 58  percent the funding for these crucial R&D  projects. We need more of the kind of re search being carried out at Argonne Nation al Laboratory in Illinois-like the dry-scrub ber that I dedicated one year ago-not less.  I will also continue to fight with Congress man PAUL SIMON  to  turn the Carbondale  Mining Technology Center into a national  center  for  research  into overcoming  the  problems of the high-sulfur coal industry.  We must not allow the current glut in the  oil market to lull us into excessive depend ence on a single energy source. The full uti lization of high-sulfur coal as a liquid fuel methanol-can and will be  important  to  future generations.  In fact, while we  in  the United States  have been slow to develop a real interest in  the use of methanol, the Japanese have al ready  expressed  their  eagerness  to  use  methanol as a clean burning boiler fuel. As  Chairman of the Foreign Relations Commit tee, I have been working on a project with  the Japanese government which, over a 30year period, could use as much as 186 mil lion tons of number six Illinois coal.  In a nutshell, the project calls for the con struction of a methanol plant in Panama  that would be supplied with  Illinois coal  shipped through New Orleans. The metha nol would be piped across Panama to super tankers for the trip across  the Pacific to  Japan. I am happy to report that progress  to date on this project ha.s been good-we  already have $2.5 million in federal support  for the project and we fully expect the pri vate sector  in  the U.S. and the Japanese  government to lend additional support.  I know that the issue of highest priority  at your Legislative Conference this year is  the acid rain legislation that has been intro duced in the 98th Congress. Despite the lack  of firm scientific evidence,  this legislation  calls for a ten-million ton annual reduction  of sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmos phere. It places the entire burden of reduc ing emissions on the Midwest-on the utili ties  that burn high sulfur coal and, ulti mately, on  the miners who extract  that  coal.  It callously  disregards  the human  misery that will be felt from Illinois to West  Virginia.  Up until now, the debate on this legisla tion has unfortunately been couched in the  rhetoric  of  ""environmentalists""  versus  ""labor and industrial concerns."" I do not see  it that way. In my sixteen years in the U.S.  Senate, I have worked closely with both in dustry and labor and I have enjoyed your  support. And no one can question my record  as an environmentalist or my support for  providing a  clean and healthful environ ment for all Americans. The real question at  hand on this legislation is whether this can  be achieved without sufficient evidence as  to whether the benefits will outweigh the  costs which would be borne by thousands of  American workers and consumers.  Let's look at those costs. Six months ago, I  asked  the U.S. Department of Energy  to  prepare an impact statement on how this  acid rain legislation would affect the high  sulfur coal  industry. I was so startled by  their findings that I asked another agency,  the Congressional Research Service of the  U.S. Library of Congress, to conduct its own  study. I am releasing both of these studies  to you today. This is what they had to say:  Over  21,000  Illinois miners  and  allied  workers will permanently lose their jobs if  this legislation becomes law;  Most utilities now burning  Illinois coal  will switch to low-sulfur Western coal as the  least costly way to comply with the strin gent S-0-2 reductions called for in the legis lation;  By 1995, Illinois coal production will drop  by at least 40 percent, or 25.6 million tons, if  this legislation becomes law;  The brunt of this decline in coal produc tion will be felt in Randolph, Perry, Jack son, Williamson, Saline, and Gallatin Coun ties. Dr. Larry Parker of the Congressional  Research Service  calls  the  impact  ""very  harsh."" Unemployment  in  these counties,  already at 18.2 percent last December, will  be driven up to an unbelievable 29 percent.  Personal income in those counties will drop  by $200 million or 20 percent.  These casualties will be created despite  the lack of evidence on the ""benefits"" side.  despite  the fact that we already have an  acid rain strategy in place that requires up  to a 90 percent reduction in S-0-2 emissions  for new emissions sources. Despite the belief  by some scientists that the 10-million-ton S0-2 reduction called for by the legislation  may not save a single fish or tree.  Let me tell you about my approach to this  problem. It calls for evidence, hard facts on  the benefits and the costs. I have cospon sored legislation with Senator Byrd of West  Virginia that will accelerate  the study of  this problem, and get us clear answers to  this problem no later than 1987. Our ap proach says let's not wait until 1995, as the  acid rain legislation says, to bring relief to  the sports fishing industry of the Northeast.  Let us bring relief in 1984 through a federal  program  to  fund  the  liming of acidified  lakes, regardless of the cause.  Let's follow the lead of Sweden, which has  successfully brought back to life up to 1,500  lakes where  fish  had  previously  been  dying-at a cost of only five million dollars,  no lost jobs, and no increased costs to utili ties and consumers. Sweden plans to expand  this program to 20,000 lakes by 1986.  The Byrd bill, which I fully support, pro vides for up to 75 percent federal support  for state liming programs similar to those  which have been so successful in Sweden.  The most important aspect of this bill  is  that we are preserving  jobs while we are  searching for a viable solution to the acid  rain problem-one which is based on hard  facts and clear evidence.  We have learned from the U.S. Depart ment of Energy and the Congressional Re search Service that the acid rain legislation  currently pending in Congress would cause  an economic catastrophe in America's heart land. It will retard conversions to coal from  overpriced Canadian natural gas and  im",1983
30,288,3,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I sup port S. 4 7, the Ocean Shipping Act of  1983,  a  bill  to  revise  regulation of  international liner shipping operating  in the U.S. foreign commerce.  After years of hearings and debate,  this long-awaited legislation will bring  U.S. regulation of international ocean borne commerce into the 1980's-this  change is sorely needed.  The Shipping Act of 1916 cannot ac commodate the radical changes that  have taken place in both international  and domestic economic and political  environments. First, the Ocean Ship ping Act of 1983 responds to the need  to achieve comity with our  trading  partners  in  regulating  ocean  com merce. This is accomplished by clarify ing the antitrust immunity that is ex tended  to  international ocean  liner  conferences. Essentially, the rules of  the game  are better definded  and  more  consistent with  international  practices.  Second,  in clarifying  the scope of  the antitrust immunity, the legislation  serves to better balance the burden of  fear of prosecution under U.S. anti trust laws. Existing law weighs heavily  on American  interests while  foreign  liner operators, under the protection  of  their governments, have  little or  nothing to fear from enforcement of  U.S. antitrust laws. It is high time that  we act to correct the unfairness of this  situation by making  the  rules  the  same for everyone in the liner ship ping business.  Third, this bill deregulates sensibly.  By eliminating the costly and  timeAs  consuming preapproval review of com mercial  agreements by  the Federal  Maritime Commission, private enter prise can more quickly respond to a  changing  international marketplace.  Elimination of unnecessary  interven tion by  the Federal Government  in  commercial activities is a primary ob jective of S. 1593, and  is consistent  with  the  Commerce  Committee's  desire and  the Senate's wish  to  im prove the performance and productivi ty of Government agencies. Ths bill  also  reduced  the wasteful, needless,  and  confusing dual  jurisdiction be tween the Federal Maritime Commis sion and the Department of Justice.  Predictability  in the enforcement of  our maritime statutes has been want ing of  late. Unfortunately,  this has  caused increasing friction among our  trading partners and uncertainty  in  the industry, the tremendous costs of  which are not easily measured.  Finally,  the passage of S. 4 7 will  begin an era of prosperity for U.S. ex ports. No one here can argue the im portance of increasing the export of  U.S. goods and products  to  foreign  markets. The health and welfare of  the American  economy depends on  sustaining growth  in  this area. The  key to growth is in creating an envi ronment conducive  to shipping U.S.  goods abroad. This important legisla tion is a critical step in that process.  the bill  took shape, compromises  reached between the export shippers  and  the ocean carriers assured that  commercial flexibility is at the heart  of  this  legislation.  In providing  for  service  contracts,  including  time/  volume rates, and independent action,  this legislation allows U.S. shippers to  exercise considerable flexibility in ar ranging favorable  terms for the car riage of U.S. products to foreign mar kets. This means that U.S. goods will  be more competitive  in foreign mar kets. Export growth will follow.  Furthermore,  American  interests  will be better able to capitalize on the  efficiencies of intermodalism by clari fying regulatory  jurisdiction of such  cargo movements. Dual intermodal ju risdiction between the ICC and FMC is  harmful to U.S. foreign commerce and  needs  to be eliminated. This Nation  can no longer afford to not take full  advantage of advances  in intermodal  technology and the commercial oppor tunities that follow.  Even beyond the strong support of  the many and diverse elements of the  maritime industry, this legislation has  widespread support from other areas  as well. Our Nation's ports have en dorsed this bill. Shippers, both large  and small, believe this bill would result  in lower freight rates and more flexi ble service. The overwhelmingly favor able vote on a similar bill last year in  the House of Representatives-350 in  favor  to only 33 opposed-is further  evidence of the worth of this legislation. The issue clearly enjoys biparti san support.  This legislation is sorely misunder stood. The bill is fundamentally a long  step toward deregulation. It provides  U.S. enterprise with greater freedom  and flexibility to better compete in a  dynamic international marketplace. It  clarifies the scope of antitrust immu nity clouded by years of piecemeal  court decisions and regulatory zeal.  The need to change the way we reg ulate international maritime trade  is  long overdue. S. 47 is a good start and  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this measure.  e ",1983
31,288,3,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, as  chairman of the committee that has  oversight over a number of transporta tion modes,  I  am pleased with  the  product now being brought before the  Senate and urge its passage.  The Shipping Act of 1983 is unusual  in that it repiesents for the most part  a consensus of carriers and shippers those who  provide  ocean  shipping  services and are seeking to maximize  income, and those who are consumers  of that service seeking the lowest cost  ocean transportation. For this reason,  I  feel  comfortable  that  the Senate  Commerce Committee  has  reported  out an excellent piece of legislation.  At the end of World War II, U.S.  ships carried the most of U.S. goods  moving in foreign commerce. Today,  roughly  25  percent of  these goods  move on U.S. ships. In other words,  U.S. carrie?""s receive only $4.5 billion  of the $15 billion freight bill paid by  U.S. producers to move $200 billion of  U.S. goods on liner ships.  A major reason for U.S. carriers' di minishing role in ocean commerce is  our outmoded and complicated system  of Federal regulation, which has been  more heavily  enforced  against U.S.  carriers than their foreign competition  and imposed operating restrictions in hibiting  their ability  to  respond  to  changing market  conditions  and  to  best serve shippers' needs.  S. 47  is a  long-overdue update and  recodification of these laws. Its intent  is to clarify this antiquated and highly  technical statute <the Shipping Act,  1916)  to  reflect  today's commercial  needs and requirements.  By  streamlining  the  regulatory  review process and by increasing op portunities for marketplace competi tion, many federally imposed barriers,  which helped to inflate transportation  costs, will be removed. Once these bar riers are removed,  the marketplace's  competitive forces should aid U.S. pro ducers and carriers in their efforts to  contain and reduce ocean transporta tion costs.  A recent General Accounting Office  study on the need for maritime regula tory reform also recommends eliminat ing these Federal regulatory barriers.  It offered  two options for doing so.  ",1983
32,314,3,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to draw congressional attention  to the intensification of antichurch ac tivities in the Soviet Union.  Any Soviet official will tell you that  individuals can worship as they please  in the U.S.S.R. The Soviet Constitu tion, he says, guarantees freedom of  religion and freedom from religion. A  clever phrase, but what does it mean?  It means religious sites are razed, reli gious processions are disrupted, and  religious  officials  are  prevented sometimes  violently-from  carrying  out their functions.  In the wake of the Polish unrest and the strong role of the Catholic  Church in that protest-religious re pression has become more widespread  and more brutal, particularly in Po land's small but  strategic neighbor  Lithuania. Since October 1980,  three  priests have been murdered under sus picious  circumstances  in Lithuania.  Eyewitnesses saw one of the victims,  Father Bronius Laurinavicius, thrown  beneath  the wheels  of  a  speeding  truck. The KGB has been implicated  in  all  three deaths  and numerous  other physical assaults on priests. The  young Father Ricardas Cerniauskas  was warned by Soviet security police  to silence his criticism of the system or  face an extraordinary death. And now,  for the first time in 10 years, a priest  faces  imprisonment  in Lithuania for  February 24, 1983  religious activity. On January 26, the  Soviet news agency Tass reported that  Father Alfonsas Svarinskas had been  charged with anti-Soviet activity for  giving sermons that systematically in stigated believers,  to wage, an open  struggle against Soviet power.  The opening of criminal proceedings  against  Father  Svarinskas  coupled  with heightened harassment of Catho lics  in general  is a clear sign  from  Moscow to the Lithuanian Church: It  will not enjoy the latitude allowed the  Polish Church. At the same time, the  unusual announcement of a human  rights arrest by Tass may be regarded  as an ominous test of Western opinion  before  a  renewed  crackdown  on  human rights activity in Lithuania.  The Soviet Union adheres to a clear  double  standard  on  human  rights  issues. It is fine for the government to  profess its commitment to liberty and  freedom, but any  individual who re quests that these promises be kept is  subject to intimidation, imprisonment,  or even death. We cannot allow this  brutal disregard for human dignity to  go unnoticed. The people of Lithua nia-a nation that has always received  steadfast U.S. support-deserve our at tention and concern. I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in public protest  against religious repression in Lithua nia.e  LEGISLATION  TO  DESIGNATE  JANUARY  4,  1984 AS ALASKA  STATEHOOD DAY  HON. DON YOUNG  OF ALASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1983  e ",1983
33,314,3,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speak er, 25 years ago  this June, Congress  approved  the Alaska Statehood Act,  paving the way for Alaska's entry into  the Union as  the 49th State.  I am  proud to introduce today in the House  of Representatives a  resolution com memorating the silver anniversary of  Alaska statehood.  Alaska's entry into the Union was  not easily accomplished. World War II  had pointed to the necessity of state hood for Alaska. The Japanese inva sion of the Aleutians, lend lease flights  across Alaska to the Soviet Union, and  later  the cold war and  its resulting  early warning radar stations convinced  the Nation that Alaska was vital  to  the national defense. Even  so,  the  Alaska statehood  issue was a hotly  contested  subject during  the 1950's  with  the  chief  arguments  against  statehood being Alaska's alleged  in ability to pay its own way and the fact  that Alaska was not contiguous to the  continental United States.  In  June  1958,  after numerous proposals and  counterproposals, Congress approved  statehood for Alaska. On July 7, 1958,  ",1983
34,327,3,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, the ad ministration's proposed rapid defense  buildup poses serious risks both to our  national security and to the health of  our economy. Congress, in considering  the President's massive  rearmament  program, must weight its costs to the  American people.    In his budget for fiscal year 1984,  President Reagan proposed  the con tinuation of the 5-year military build up that he initiated 2 years ago at a  cost of $1.8 trillion, roughly a cost of  $20,000  in  taxes per household over  the next 5 years. This constitutes the  largest  peacetime  defense  spending  program in the history of our Nation,  at a real rate of increase after infla tion of 7 percent. Yet, despite esti mates of wasteful Pentagon spending  ranging from $30 to $100 billion, the  President's budget provides for no sav ings based on elimination of wasteful  spending.  The  President's military  budget  gives top priority to the development  of new strategic nuclear weapons, a 37percent increase in nuclear force fund ing in this year's budget. I fear that  adding to our nuclear arsenal will only  trigger another dangerous escalation  in the balance of terror between the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  United States and the Soviet Union.  The  administration's  arms  control  policy, based as it is on arms increases,  is a bankrupt policy. We need a Presi dent who will assume the leadership  role in arms control negotiations with  the Soviets. Congress must  take  its  own lead on arms control by passing  the resolution calling for a bilateral,  verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons  production, development, testing, and  delivery systems.  The greater sha~e of our defense  budget should be spent on convention al systems, although streamlined,  to  insure  readiness  and  sustainability,  and to educate our service personnel.  We now have complex weapons sys tems with personnel lacking the exper tise to use them. In addition, I believe  it is time for our allies to assume their  fair share of their own defense, rather  than relying solely on the American  people to finance their defense-related  expenditures. The President's budget  includes no initiative for cost sharing  with our allies.  At the same time that the military  budget is being increased, spending on  human needs program is being drasti cally reduced. In my estimation, our  natural resources should be  invested  in activities which would put Ameri cans back to work and put the United  States on the road to prosperity. Our  economic recovery must not be jeop ardized by excessive defense spending.  Studies have documented that every  dollar spent on military programs cre ates  far  fewer  jobs  than  the same  dollar spent in any other sector of the  economy. Jobs in the defense industry  are more highly skilled than in other  sectors and thus open to fewer Ameri can workers. Furthermore, some influ ential economists have voiced concern  that the planned rate of increase for  military spending is too fast and might  strain some sectors of the economy,  thereby contributing to another infla tionary spiral similar to those which  occurred when the United States ex panded its arsenals as rapidly in the  past.  Excessive military spending also con tributes to declining productivity. Con centrating scientific work on military  projects  reduces  the share available  for productivity that increases innova tion in other sectors. With so much  money and skilled  labor diverted  to  military programs and away from civil ian production, America's competitive  advantage over Japan and other indus trialized nations is bound to suffer.  Defense spending is one of the most  regionally  unbalanced  categories  of  Federal  spending. More  than  any  other other Federal program, defense  spending drains resources and jobs out  of the industrial Midwest and trans fers  them  to economically healthier  areas of the country. According to De partment of Defense figures, $93.4 bil lion of the fiscal 1983 defense budget3051  excluding  procurement-will  go  to  States in the South and West, while  only $28.6 billion will be spent in the  Northeast-Midwest region.  This amounts to $278 per capita in  the Northeast and Midwest compared  to $739 in the South and West. Ohio  receives $3  billion  less  in Pentagon  spending  than  it contributes  in  tax  moneys which are channeled  to  the  defense  budget.  Current  military  spending is contributing to idle capac ity and unemployment in our area.  The costs of the proposed weapons  systems, once approved, will grow dra matically in succeeding years and con tribute to even greater deficits. Now is  the  time  to  rein  in  the administra tion's military spending proposals. A  strong  national  defense  cannot  be  minimized, but scarce Federal funds  must be spent wisely.  If we cannot  create jobs for the unemployed, revi talize our basic industries, educate the  next generation or care for the mem bers of our society who depend on the  Government for their basic needs, we  will not be contributing  to our Na tion's security .e  ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON. WILLIAM D. FORD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1983  ",1983
35,327,3,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, it is with great pride and admira tion that I join in the commemoration  of the 65th anniversary of Estonian  Independence Day. The  remarkable  strength and proud heritage of the Es tonian people  in  the Soviet Union,  who  face  a  never-ending  quest  to  regain their freedom, has established a  model for the world.  Today we mark the proclamation of  independence for the Republic of Es tonia. The Estonians made significant  economic,  educational,  and  cultural  progress until their freedom and inde pendence came to an end in 1940 when  they were  forcibly  annexed by  the  Soviet Union. On a day-to-day basis in  the Soviet Union,  the Estonians are  facing serious attacks to rid them of  their strong sense of heritage. They  face serious threats to their language  and culture. This is yet another exam ple of the Soviet attempt to Russian ize these people out of existence.  Free nations of the world must con tinue to speak out against this Soviet  aggression. We will never  recognize  their seizure of Estonia. As a signatory  of  the Helsinki accords,  the Soviet  Union continues to deny these individ uals  their basic human  rights-the  free exercise of political, cultural, and  religious freedoms.

36,340,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  want to call the attention of my col leagues to a recent tragedy in Afghani stan. I believe that this incident recon firms that the Soviets will do anything  to maintain  their viselike grip over  that once free and peaceful nation.  As all of you know, the brutal Soviet  occupation of Afghanistan began  in  1980. Since that time, Afghani resist ance fighters have engaged in a lonely,  and  difficult  guerrilla  campaign  against  superior  Russian  air  and  ground  forces. Although  the heavy  fighting will  continue,  the Kremlin  has already basically fulfilled its pri mary objectives in Afghanistan. It has  set up the puppet Karma! regime in  Kabul and has occupied the country  with 105,000 well-armed troops.  According to the article which ap peared in the Washington Post this  month, over 105 Afghani men, women,  and children were brutally burned to  death  in  an  underground well  by  Soviet soldiers. The ""Resting Place of  the Comb"" is a small village some 30  miles south of Kabul.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  As Soviet  soldiers  and  tanks  ap proached the small village, many of its  frightened inhabitants fled and hid in  an underground water  tunnel  that  serves as the town's water supply. Fol lowing  the  commanding  officer's  orders, Soviet soldiers pumped hun dreds of gallons of gasoline into the  tunnel when the Afghani villagers re fused  to  come out of  their hiding  place. A few minutes later, after incen diary chemicals were dropped into the  tunnel, the gasoline was  ignited and  105  innocent people were burned to  death. It took 7 days for the villagers  to drag all of the bodies out of the  tunnel.  The World Press has carried equally  horrible stories of Soviet forces poi soning village wells, using poison gas,  and strafing innocent Afghanis with  the  intimidating  firepower of  their  helicopters. While all of this violence  goes on, the Kremlin insists that it is a  peace-loving  nation which  respects  human rights and has no expansionist  tendencies.  In spite of more than 12,000 Soviet  dead and wounded and an estimated  $1.5 billion in direct aid merely to prop  up the Afghan army, I believe that the  Russians intend to stay.  With this in mind, our Government  should do everything in its power to  call this bloody occupation of a small  and peaceful nation to the attention  of the world. Let us also bring pres sure to bear on the Soviets to convince  them that they must withdraw. I am  sure that many of my colleagues can  recall  the many  clever  techniques  which the Kremlin used against our  Government when we were so heavily  involved in Vietnam a number of years  ago. Let all of us  in  the Congress  commit ourselves to getting the illegal  occupiers out of Af ghanistan.e  CONGRESSIONAL  COMMEMORA TIVE  SALUTE TO THE ESTO NIAN  PEOPLE ON THE  65TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  ESTONIAN  INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON. ROBERT A. ROE  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 25, 1983   ",1983
37,340,3,Mr. ROE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to join my colleagues in commemorat ing the 65th anniversary of the Re public of Estonia's Declaration of In dependence. It is a day for all of us to  remember that there are millions of  people living in Estonia and other na tions around  the world who do not  enjoy the basic rights of freedom of  thought, movement,  and  expression  that we all take for granted.  The situation taking place in Poland  has special significance for the people  of Estonia. Both nations emerged as  independent states following the end  February 25, 1983  of World War I. But the great poten tial they both expressed as free states  came to a tragic end as a result of the  heinous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of  1939. As a result of that agreement,  Poland was divided between Germany  and the Soviet Union, while Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania were condemned  to the Soviet rule that controls them  to this day.  The Soviet ruling elite should take  note that while it maintains political  control over Estonia, it will never be  able to obliterate the strong national  traditions held by the people who live  there. In spite of Soviet domination,  the Estonian people continue to hold  onto  their  cultural  heritage. They  have never given up  the hope  that  someday they will once again be able  to raise the Estonian national flag in a  declaration of freedom from Russian  rule.  The stirrings of that new independ ence are being expressed  in Estonia  today. The Polish Solidarity move ment has had a strong influence on  Estonian workers. In September 1980,  Estonian dissidents sent a message of  support  to  Solidarity  leader Lech  Walesa, and 1 month later, a strike  took  place  at an Estonian  tractor  plant.  It has recently been reported in the  press  that Estonian workers are at tempting  to organize a  countrywide  half-hour strike every month in sup port of Solidarity. It has also been re ported that Soviet authorities have de tained 150 Estonians for attempting to  organize that work stoppage.  All Americans  should  give  their  strongest support to  this stirring of  human rights activism in Estonia. The  events in Poland have set off a chain  of events that hopefully will culminate  in a new burst of  freedom  for  the  Soviet-occupied Baltic republics.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of House  Ad Hoc Committee  on  the Baltic  States, I urge my colleagues to support  the efforts of  the Estonian human  rights movement.e  SOVIET WATCH  HON.

The delegation visited Len ingrad, Moscow, Budapest, Bucharest,  and Belgrade. The trip also included  Athens where our delegation met with  European parliamentarians on similar  issues.  While the U.S. delegation met with a  variety of officials and covered a range  of subjects, I am limiting this report to  human rights issues.  Overall, there is no discernible im provement  in  the oppressive  condi tions that exist in Communist coun tries. As the world becomes more con scious of human rights as a measure of  national decency and many countries  are working to improve the political  conditions as an acceptable form of  national behavior, we found little evi dence  of  similar  improvements  in  Russia and her satellite neighbors. If  anything,  the political  climate has  worsened in Russia and Romania with  small likelihood that there will be any  easing of the internal tension that is  so obvious in those two countries. We  discovered cautious optimism  in  the  other countries as limited freedom is  3077  being experienced, but that may prove  illusionary depending on a number of  factors in what definitely is an uncer tain future  for  the people of  these  areas.  At least two important developments  add to that uncertainty. First, Secre tary Yury Andropov, who has emerged  as the undisputed boss at the Kremlin,  remains an enigmatic political figure.  In Russia, it is obvious that everyone  was waiting and watching to see what  kind of  leadership he will provide.  Andropov has moved quickly on  a  campaign against  corruption, which  was interpreted as legitimate given the  widespread abuses at higher levels, but  also a move of weeding out the decay ing and possibly hostile elements  in  high level government and party posi tions.  The new Kremlin leader is viewed as  smart and tough, and capable of pro viding  enlightened  leadership  com pared to the more bureaucratic Leonid  Brezhnev, but he is equally adept of  using his personal resources as a ruth less and unrelenting advocate of global  communism. The consensus is that it  is much too early to tell how he will  deal with  human  rights  issues  at  home, or how much latitude will be  given to Soviet-dominated countries in  Eastern Europe.  The second factor may be beyond  Andropov's or anyone's control, for it  concerns the economic fate of these  countries. Everywhere we visited,  it  was the state of the economy, particu larly the emerging Third World coun tries and the shaky international fi nancial  system  that worried people  the most. Economic strains were being  felt, particularly in Hungary, Roma nia, and Yugoslavia. The link between  economic -conditions,  public  unrest  and  suppression  is an undisputable  fact. Poland is an obvious reminder.  Leaders with whom we met talked in cessantly about their economic prob lems and urged the United States to  be sensitive and provide more help. In  my judgment, the human rights pic ture will not improve under such con ditions. As these regimes become more  threatened by greater unrest among  their populations, who have enjoyed  meager but relatively bitter economic  standards, there will undoubtedly be  more repressive measures introduced.  u.s.s.R.  In our 4-day visit  to Russia, we  found no improvement in the human  rights situation. If anything, we heard  repeated  statements  about  a  new  crackdown. There was little evidence  that immigration quotas, which have  declined remarkably in recent years,  would improve. Refuseniks were frus trated in their attempts to leave the  country. The more celebrated dissi dents have all but given up hope for  freedom. Religious  persecution per sists throughout the Soviet Union. We  11-059 0-87-12 (Pt. 3)  ",1983
40,366,3,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  natural gas decontrol bill which the  Reagan administration is  introducing  today  is hailed by  the President as  that rarest of all commodities-a free  lunch. According  to  the President,  prices will go down, supplies will go  up, the free market will operate per fectly to bring buyers and sellers to gether in harmony-in short, everyone  will be fat and happy.  Mr. Speaker, that ""free lunch"" will  be cooked with gas, but it will not be  free. It is the American consumer who  is going to pick up the $50 billion tab.  We are in our present predicament,  with demand down and prices soaring  up, because natural gas producers and  natural gas pipelines used current leg islation  and  an  inactive  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission to bid  prices  out  of  reason  on  contracts  which pass costs on to the consumers  whether or not  the gas  is  actually  shipped or consumed.  Those same companies now claim  that the contracts which they negoti ated are the blame of regulation and  not their own greed. So how does the  administration respond?  D 1230  Take away any ceilings on gas dis covered before 1977, which was never  to be decontrolled.  The  administration's proposal  for  extinguishing a fire is to pour on more  fuel. It is  like saying ""We are going  too fast; step on the gas.""  What we need is a solution to the  current gas price increases that treats  all Americans fairly, that assures ade quate supplies, adequate incentive for  gas exploration and reasonable prices.  The  President's proposal  assures  none of these basic criteria. His pro posal  is only a  fool's rush  to stuff  more dollars into the pockets of the  major oil companies. There is no free  lunch. There can be none. When the  President  learns  that  basic  lesson,  then and only then will the American  people  accept  his word  on  energy  policy.  The residential consumer and Amer ica's small businesses and farmers de serve the assurance that their liveli hoods will not be endangered by the  cost of keeping warm. They deserve  the help in the midst of their peril.  They deserve much more  than  the  wolf of decontrol  in  the attractive  wrapping of consumer protection.  ",1983

44,431,3,Mr. TOWER.," Mr. President, I would  like  to call  to  the attention of  the  Senate a report written by my distin guished colleague, the senior Senator  from South Carolina, Senator STROM  THURMOND.  Senator THURMOND visited the Fed eral Republic of Germany following  the adjournment of the 97th Congress  and  toured several military  installa tions. He also had occasion  to visit  with Ambassador Burns and his staff  and receive  their views on German American relations. Additionally, Sen ator THURMOND had the opportunity  to meet with officials of the German  Ministry of State and Ministry of De fense.  Senator THURMOND's report indicates  very  serious German  concern  over  issues such as ""Specialty Metals"" and  the deletion of funds for ""Host Nation  Support."" The decision on ""Specialty  Metals"" alone could well destroy the  cooperative efforts on standardizing  NATO arms that have been underway  since 1976.  Mr. President, I find Senator THUR MOND's analysis  to be  timely and  I  commend it to the attention of my col leagues. I ask that the report with en closures be included in the RECORD at  the conclusion of my remarks.  The report follows:  General.-During  VISIT TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF  GERMANY-SENATOR STROM THURMOND  INTRODUCTION  the  period December  26-31,  1982,  Senator Strom Thurmond,  Ranking Majority Member of  the Senate  Armed Services Committee and Chairman  of its Military Construction Subcommittee  visited military installations in the Federal  Republic of Germany <FRG ). In addition,  Senator Thurmond met with officials of the  German government, and with Ambassador  Burns and his staff.  Purpose.-Senator Thurmond last visited  the FRG during April 1981. In making a  return visit to the FRG, Senator Thurmond  set several objectives:  1. To review the facilities situation with  emphasis on the living and working condi tions faced by American service personnel;  2. To review with major U.S. military com manders the overall balance of forces situa tion;  3. To meet with key German government  officials to discuss matters of mutual con cern; and  4. To confer with Ambassador Burns and  his staff to get the benefit of their views on  German-American relations.  Itinerary.-Travel to and from the FRG  was by regularly scheduled Military Airlift  Command C-5 aircraft. Senator Thurmond  arrived in the FRG on the morning of De cember  27,  1982,  and  departed  in  the  evening on December 31, 1982. Locations  visited included Ramstein Air Force Base  Baumholder, Heidelberg, Bonn, Frankfurt:  Fulda, Wildflecken, and Rhein Main Air  Force Base. Key officials contacted included  General Frederick Kroesen, Commanding  General, U.S. Army Europe; Lieutenant  General Robert Bazley, Deputy Command ing General, U.S. Air Forces Europe; Dr.  Arthur Burns, U.S. Ambassador to the Fed eral Republic of Germany; His Excellency  Peter-Kurz Wuerzbach, FRG Ministry of  Defense  and His Excellency Berndt von  Staden, FRG Ministry of State.

46,457,3,Mr. GORTON., The Senator will.  ,1983
47,457,3,Mr. METZENBAUM.," The Senator  from Washington has stated at an ear lier point, and states once again, that  labor supports this amendment-I am  speaking about  the Stevens amend ment, that labor supports the Stevens  amendment.  My understanding is that the AFL CIO has a neutral position on  the  overall  subject. My  further  under standing is that Mr. Frank Drozak, the  head of the Maritime Trades Depart ment of the AFL-CIO said in connec tion with this bill generally:  While the regulatory bill may help the  liner operators, it will also assist the foreign  operators as well.  He was speaking about the bill last  year.  This  is basically a housekeeping chore  which will not develop the American mari time industry, will not create one new job,  and will  not  reduce  the unemployment  problem of this country. Passage of this bill  will increase the unemployment of Ameri can seamen, shipyard workers, and American supply businesses and will siphon off  American taxes abroad.  In view of that statement and  in  view of the fact that Mr. Dennison,  legislative counsel of  the AFL-CIO,  has advised me directly that the AFL CIO has no position on the bill, would  my good friend from Washington indi cate on what basis he represents to  the Senate that labor sides with sup porting the Stevens amendment?  ",1983
48,457,3,Mr. GORTON.," I thank the Senator  from Ohio for his question.  I would, in response, read into the  RECORD at this point a copy of a letter  which I hold in my hand, the heading  of which is ""AFL-CIO Maritime Com mittee, The Voice of Maritime Labor,  100 Indiana Avenue NW., Washington,  D.C. 20001,"" and which is dated Febru ary 23, 1983,  less  than 1 week ago,  which is addressed Senator PACKWOOD  and reads as follows:  FEBRUARY 23, 1983.  Senator BOB PACKWOOD,  Russell Senate Office Building  Washington, D. C.  DEAR SENATOR PACKWOOD: We understand  that during  consideration of S.  47,  the  Ocean Shipping Act of 1983, the Judiciary  Committee will be offering an amendment  to eliminate the liner operators' current re quirement of filing  their tariffs with  the  Federal Maritime  Commission  and  the  F.M.C.'s authority  to  require compliance  with such tariffs.  The AFL-CIO Maritime Committee has  actively supported this legislation for sever al years but we are absolutely opposed to  this Judiciary Committee amendment that  would eliminate these requirements.  We respectfully urge your support for the  defeat of this amendment.  Sincerely,  TALMAGE E. SIMPKINS,  Executive Director.  ",1983
49,457,3,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  Is it not the  fact that the AFL-CIO Maritime Com mittee is not actually affiliated with  the AFL-CIO, and that on-I have in  my hand a letter dated December 14,  1981,  in which  the Maritime Trades  Department of the American Federa tion of Labor and Congress of Indus trial Organizations wrote to Members  of the House saying as follows:  For your information, we would like  to  advise you that the only official representa tives of Maritime Trades Department, AFL CIO, who will be working on legislative mat ters on Capitol Hill are     and  then  they  list  seven different  names, one of which is not Mr. Tal mage  Simpkins,  executive  director,  and it does not show anywhere in his  letter any  talk about  the AFL-CIO  Maritime Committee which, it is my  understanding,  is sort of an ad hoc  committee for management and labor  and not the official voice of the AFL CIO?

52,470,3,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, today we observe the 11th anni versary of the signing of the Shanghai  Communique which  recognized  the  People's Republic of China as the one  and only Government of China. This  is a particularly memorable occasion  for me because 4 years ago today I ad dressed this issue in my first speech in  the Senate.  This communique and the Taiwan  Relations Act created a deliberately  ambiguous situation. These acts recog nized the legitimacy of the PRC while  insuring a close and continuing friend ship with Taiwan. This policy has  become particularly vexsome because  both share a common vision of China,  both  claim  the  same  territory  for  China, and both adamantly refuse to  consider any form of partition. This  ambiguity became particularly clear  when our Government entered  into  negotiations to sell fighter aircraft to  Taiwan.  While the political and military as pects of this situation have been high lighted in the press,  there is a very  worrisome issue that has not received  the worldwide attention  that  it de serves. The human rights situation in  Taiwan remains as serious as it was 4  years ago, when I was prompted  to  speak out in the Senate. The concerns  I had then are the same today. While  we have guaranteed our political rela tions with Taiwan, we have done noth ing to insure that the Government of  Taiwan  observes  the  basic  human  rights of its people. Today, under mar tial  law,  the people of Taiwan are  denied the same rights guaranteed to  the citizens of our other allies. I can  see no excuse for denying the Taiwan ese  the  freedoms  and  fundamental  rights  that  are  already  denied  to  people on the mainland. Martial law  must come to an end in Taiwan so that  the people's right  to self-determina tion  and  representative  government  can begin.  But martial law is not the only issue.  We often overlook the fact that the  native Taiwanese are distinct from the  mainland Chinese. As such, they are in  the unenviable position of seeing their  homeland treated by both the Com munist and the KMT governments as  simply a  province of China,  rather  than a distinct entity. Their position is  not dissimilar from that of people in  the Baltic States, who have been in corporated into the Soviet Union de spite a history and ethnicity which are  not Russian.  The Shanghai Communique  is  a  unique solution to a vexsome problem  involving  three governments. But  it  accepts without question the position  long held by both the Communist and  the KMT  governments  concerning  Taiwan. As such, it is incomplete, for  it does not take into account the views  of  the native Taiwanese  themselves.  This oversight  is  regrettable,  to say  the least.  Clearly, we  cannot  repudiate  the  Shanghai Communique. But I believe  that we ought to bear in mind the po sition and the concerns of the native  Taiwanese when we deal with the Peo ple's Republic and with authorities on  Taiwan. To accept without question  the view  that native Taiwanese are  Chinese  subjects-regardless of who  ",1983
53,483,3,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker,  in  recent months, the energy tax credit  incentives for development and utiliza tion of alternative energy forms have  been under attack. Labeled as wasteful  or ineffective, the credits have been a  prime target for individuals seeking to  close loopholes and raise revenues.  Recently.  the announcement of a  new waste-to-energy  powerplant  in  Lincoln, Nebr., proved  the value of  these  tax credits. Thanks  to  these  credits  and  accelerated depreciation  provisions of the 1981 Economic Re covery Tax Act, more than 200 tempo rary construction jobs will be created  in  the  community  by  this  plant.  Roughly 20 permanent  jobs will be  created and the environmental condi tion of the city will be  improved as  well.  I encourage my colleagues to read  the following article from the Lincoln  Star which describes this noteworthy  project. Certainly, your communities  could  reap similar benefits  if  these  credits are continued.

55,509,3,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 999, and wish to com mend  the  Interior Committee  on  which I serve, and the Education and  Labor Committee for moving expedi tiously to report H.R. 999 for the full  House's consideration. The legislation  before us, draws our attention to and  properly  focuses  on  the  important  issues of youth unemployment and the  protection  of  our natural  resource  base. With youth unemploYrn.ent at  record levels,  this bill will provide a  cost-effective program by which we  can  off er  our  unemployed  young  people meaningful conservation  jobs  that foster in them a value and under standing of our natural resources and  in doing so, show them that they are a  worthwhile part of what makes this  country as great as it is.  In my own State of Minnesota, we  have had a  successful Federal-State  conservation program for a number of  years. Before Reagan administration  budget cuts  took hold, between 500  and 600 young Minnesotans were in volved in a coordinated effort to reha bilitate and upgrade Minnesota State  parks, historic sites, game refuges, and  wildlife areas. With the demise of the  YCC  and YACC  programs,  the  re source managers within the State of  Minnesota have been hard pressed to  respond to conservation and rehabili tation needs.  The need for resource conservation  work is well documented. H.R. 999 is a  means by which we can meet this need  in a cost-effective way while achieving  important social goals. In the present  time of fiscal restraint, this legislation  will deliver services of a greater value  than the cost of the program. With  funds  to  carry  out  the  program  coming from the sale and use of our  natural resources, we are recognizing  the rieed to retrench funds back into  the resource base.  H.R. 999 is designed to promote the  development of our greatest natural  resource-our young people. The un employment  rate  that exists among  our youth,  especially minority  and  economically disadvantaged youth, is a  national shame. At a  time when we  should be promoting the development  of our young people to become produc tive members of our society, the stark  figures of youth unemployment attest  to our  inability  to make use of the  minds,  energy,  and  ambition  our  young people possess.  Shortly,  this House will begin  the  consideration of emergency jobs legis lation. H.R. 999 gives us the opportu nity to work hand-in-hand with that  effort to alleviate the tragic statistics  of youth unemployment. In a modest  way, the American Conservation Corps  program  is a step that says we are  going to do something with regard to  addressing  the serious youth unem ployment tragedy.  Sympathy  for  the problem  is not  enough. There  ne.eds  to  be  some  action. The American Conservation  Corps program fits  that need. If we  are serious about the problems we face  in maintaining our natural resources  and providing '.for the growth and de velopment of our young people, then  we will enact H.R. 999, I urge its pas sage.

The purpose  of this legislation is twofold: To pro vide  jobs  and  training  for  young  people who need them and to accom plish needed conservation work  in a  cost-effective way.  We are all very much aware of the  terrible unemployment problem our  country is facing, and there is a great  demand to do something about it. The  question is, ""What?"" The bill before us  provides one good answer. It will pro vide a lot of jobs for the money and it  will  help  one  of  our  hardest  hit  groups-our unemployed youth.  Unlike some of the big pork-barrel  projects lurking in the other so-called  jobs bills,  the projects  this bill will  fund will tend to be labor-intensive, in expensive, and cost-effective. At  the  same  time,  they will provide useful  work experience for the young people  to be served and will help them secure  follow-on employment.

59,522,3,Mr. ST GERMAIN.," Mr. Speaker,  high interest rates-despite some welcome  downward  trends  in  selected  areas-continue to hold back economic  recovery.  Belatedly,  the Reagan administra tion  is  recognizing  that  something  must be done about interest rates if we  are to have any hope of putting people  back to work in this Nation. Inflation  is down, but interest rates remain at  double digit levels even for big busi ness borrowers. For small businessmen  and consumers, interest rates have not  budged or, at best, have moved only a  fraction off historically high levels.  Last week, President Reagan  sug gested  that commercial banks were  keeping  interest  rates at artificially  high levels.  ""It is up to the banks,"" he said, ""And  there is no reason-I do not think why the banks could not bring those  interest rates down another notch or  two.""  Only a few days before, Secretary of  the Treasury Donald Regan, bluntly  stated: ""Banks are doing their utmost  to keep interest rates up.""  And President Reagan's chief eco nomic  adviser,  Martin  Feldstein,  chimed in with a prediction that long term rates will not move much over  ""the next few months.""  Mr. Speaker, we are happy to have  the Reagan administration, at  long  last,  recognize  the destruction  that  high  interest rates have brought to  the economy over  the past  several  years. The landscape is littered with  the remains of businesses, farms, and  jobs destroyed by  runaway  interest  rates.  Mr. Speaker, clearly  the economy  needs  a  real  reduction  in  interest  rates-a  reduction  across  the board  that will  give American  families  a  chance to buy a home, that will allow  small  businessmen  to  reopen  their  doors, and that will give job-producing  industries new life.  And we need more than just a short term reduction. We need some assur ances that we will never again allow  people and businesses to be destroyed  by  the unconscionably high  interest  rates and the scorched-earth monetary  policies of 1981 and 1982. The Ameri can people need long-range protection.  They need assurance  that someone  will  step  in before  the economy  is  crushed.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the  President and his economic advisers  are speaking out about the problem,  even at this late date. But, we need  more than hand wringing statements  in times of ecomomic crisis. Economic  jawboning means a lot more-carries a  lot more weight-when there is a club  in the corner in the event the lenders  do not get the word.

99,548,3,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I want  to offer my gratitude  to my close  friend,  the Senator from Minnesota,  who  first  presented me with  an  amendment  la.st  evening  somewhat  similar to the one which he has just  proposed.  As he knows,  the  amendment  is  technically nongermane to this bill as  this bill does not deal with the promo tional  aspects  of merchant marine  policy, but merely with its regulatory  aspects.  The Senator from Minnesota also  knows that I have some very real sym pathies with him in some of the goals  which  he  is  attempting  to  reach  through  the  presentation  of  this  amendment. During the course of the  97th Congress he and I were on oppo site sides of a number of attempts to  either repeal the preference elements  of Public Law 480 or to at lea.st put a  limit on those elements.  He knows that while I feel it appro priate to preserve present cargo pref erence laws, I have not been active in  any attempts to expand or to increase  them.  The Senator from Minnesota also  knows that I do not wish in any way to  subvert or to harm the prospects of  the United States in selling agricultur al commodities overseas. That kind of  sale is going to be every bit as benefi cial  to my own constituents  in  the  State of Washington as it will be to  those of the Senator from Minnesota.  We  attempted  to  come  up with  something, working frantically while  debate was going on on other amend ments, which could do this. I am sym pathetic, but in the absence of hear ings on the subject dealing specifically  with new programs, such as PIK, we  were unable to reach that kind of ac commodation at this point.  I would simply want to thank the  Senator from Minnesota for bringing  this matter to our attention, for not  pressing it to a vote on a bill which is  already controversial, and  to assure  him, as he already knows, that I do  have a great deal of sympathy with  some elements of what he is trying to  do  in order to strike an appropriate  balance  preserving  the  merchant  marine but granting  the maximum  possible ability to all of our farmers  and agriculturalists to sell as much of  their commodities overseas as possible.  I can assure him I will try to help  him reach that goal in the future.  ",1983
100,548,3,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," I thank the dis tinguished Senator from Washington.  He states very well the goal we are  trying to achieve, which is the broad  exportability with respect to agricul tural products-indeed with respect to  all products-so although  the cargo  preference provisions apply principally  to agricultural products, we are not  trying to constrict the application of  the cargo preference rules. It is  just  their expansion that we are concerned  with.  Mr. President, unless there are fur ther comments I withdraw my amend ment at this time and then yield back  the remainder of my time.

103,548,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Under  the previous order, there will now be  40 minutes of debate evenly divided on  the question of passage of the bill.  ",1983
104,548,3,Mr. GORTON.," The Senators do not  need to yield back any time remaining  when an amendment is withdrawn, is  that correct?  ",1983
105,548,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., That is  correct.  ,1983
106,548,3,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, we  have now reached debate on the final  passage of S. 4 7, the Ocean Shipping  Act of 1983. I do not believe I will re quire a great deal of time on this sub ject as essentially the entire debate,  both on the motion to take up the bill  and on the various amendments, has  dealt with the bill itself.  Suffice it to say that the purpose of  the bill is outlined in the committee  report in the following words, which  are as applicable to the bill as it ap pears before us now as they were to  that  subject when  it was  reported  from the Commerce Committee.  The Shipping Act of 1983 revises the Ship ping Act, 1916, to provide an updated, sim plified, more efficient, responsive, and effec tive  regulatory  scheme  for  international  liner shipping. The paramount objective of  this regulatory scheme  is  to develop and  maintain an efficient and  flexible ocean  transportation system through commercial  means, with minimum Government involve ment, in order to better serve the needs of  U.S. foreign commerce.  The Committee believes the time is ripe to  revise  the principal maritime  regulatory  statute, the Shipping Act, 1916, in order to:  < 1) end the uncertainty and delay  that  surrounds U.S. Government regulation of  ocean liner shipping, by providing a predict able  legal regime and streamlined regula tory process administered and enforced by a  single independent Federal agency <the Fed eral Maritime Commission <FMC>>.  (2) harmonize U.S. shipping practices with  those of our major trading partners, espe cially by reaffirming antitrust immunity for  certain carrier and conference activities.  (3) equalize Federal regulatory and judi cial treatment of U.S.-and foreign-flag car riers.  <4> provide both large and small shippers  with a  responsive and flexible, as well as  predictable, ocean  transportation common  carrier services.  C5) allow carriers and shippers to take ad vantage of  the  technological advances  in  ocean liner shipping and intermodal trans portation which have developed since 1916.  (6) maintain a system of free trade and  access by U.S. carriers to foreign trades.  It has always been the intention of the  Committee to balance the needs of carriers  and shippers. While the U.S. liner fleet is an  essential component of our economic and  national defense structure, shippers are the  backbone of our economy. Practically speak ing a shipper is the consumer of ocean ship ping services. They are exporters and im porters who range from an association of  small orchardists who seek to export a rela tively few containers of fruit each year, to  automobile  and  chemical manufacturers,  upon whom hundreds of thousands depend  for employment. Also closely  tied  to  the  shipper concerns are  the nation's ports,  whose interests are best served by a  large  and steady flow of commerce.  Thus  the Committee  has  consistently  sought to reconcile the naturally conflicting  interests of shippers and carriers, and is par ticularly proud of achieving the appropriate  balance the fact that shippers-the consum ers of ocean services, employers, manufac turers, agricultural and timber producers believe this bill will benefit themselves, sug gests  significant benefits  to  the nation's  economy as a whole.  I simply wish to reemphasize points  I made in the debate relative to the  la.st of the amendments of the Senator  from Ohio. This bill does not bring  perfect competition into the maritime  international  trades  of  the United  States of America. It is not possible to  do so because other nations, which are  our trading partners, would seriously  resist any such regime.  It does, however, move significantly  toward more open competition  than  has existed in the pa.st and toward a  more predictable legal system which  allows  the carriers and shippers  to  concentrate on one set of laws applica ble  to all.  It will,  I  am convinced,  result in more efficient ocean trans portation and  in  lower prices  than  would otherwise be the case for ocean  shippers and international commerce.  It is a proposal which was drafted in  consultation with all of the interest  groups affected by international trade  by ocean. It has, I must say, been im proved by the amendments of the dis tinguished Senator from South Caroli na on behalf of the Judiciary Commit tee, and the hard-working and distin guished  Senator  from  Utah  <Mr.  HATCH).  The net result of those amendments  is to add another degree of competi tion into a bill which was already more  competitive  than  is  the  current  regime.  .  Therefore, it deserves the support of  the vast majority of the Members of  this body just as it has the support of  the vast majority not only of the sup pliers of these services but of the con sumers of these services as well.

This is the  first major piece of  legislation-not  the first piece of legislation-the first  major piece of legislation he has han dled. He did  it with great style and  grace and I congratulate him for his  participation in this matter.  The Senator from Ohio has once  again exhibited his understanding and  his responsibility not only to his con stituents but to the Senate. He has  handled himself in an effective and de finitive way. If it had been one bit  more effective, we might have been  tied up in filibuster for days.  ",1983

116,561,3,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President,  in re sponse  to  the  inquiry of  the distin guished minority leader, this is one of  those happy circumstances when I can  report that we are ahead of schedule.  Indeed,  on my private notepad on  which I keep track of matters at hand,  I had suspected that we would still be  on the shipping bill, today, tomorrow,  and goodness knows how much longer.  Mr. President, I had hoped that to morrow we might take up the commit tee budget resolutions duly reported  from the Rules Committee. I will not  presume to ask the minority leader to  approve that at this time since it will  require a waiver of the 3-day rule and  agreement to take it up notwithstand ing the provisions of the 1-day rule.  But usually these are noncontroversial  and are thrashed out in the commit tees. I hope that we may be able to  waive those rules and proceed to the  consideration of those matters tomor row.  It may be  that  tomorrow and  Thursday would let us complete that,  or maybe we can do it all tomorrow.  But in any event, my first answer to  the minority leader is that if we can  clear it, I would hope to dispose of the  committee resolutions from the Rules  Committee on tomorrow.  On Thursday, Mr. President, I would  hope that we would be able to vote on  the Convention on International Ex positions on which  I have a unani mous-consent agreement I would like  to propound later.  If we get an agreement, Mr. Presi dent,  on  the Montreal  protocols,  ",1983
117,574,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I am sub mitting legislation entitled the ""Feder al Correctional Education Assistance  Act."" It would authorize the Secretary  of Education to make grants to State  education  agencies  for  educational  programs in correctional institutions.  The need for this legislation is con siderable. The prison population of  our Nation,  today,  is at an all-time  high of 500,000 people. Over the past 4  years the incarceration rate for adult  offenders has increased by more than  50  percent.  In  addition,  another  1,800,000  juveniles and adults are on  probation and parole.  The United States currently spends  about $6 billion a year to house  in mates in State correctional facilities,  local  jails,  and Federal  institutions  and centers. This amounts to almost  $13,000 a year for each inmate. That is  a  staggering amount, which exceeds  the cost of education for a year at  either Harvard or Yale. In fact, on the  average this Nation spends 2112  times  as much money on keeping a person in  prison than on sending a young man  or woman to college.  As awful as  these figures are, one  might derive some consolation from  them if these inmates were being pre pared for a productive, responsible life  upon release from prison. Sadly, that  simply is not the case.  Of the $6 billion spent to maintain  our prison system, more than 80 per cent is spent on control and security.  Less than 20 percent is spent on reha bilitation  and  training,  and  the  amount  spent  on  educational  pro grams and  services  is  even smaller.  Recent data from the National Institute of Education revealed that only 2  percent of the total cost of incarcer ation goes to vocational education and  related programs. On the average, a  State spends only 1.5 percent of its  total correctional budget on  inmate  education and training programs. Fur ther, corrections education programs  are generally plagued by  inadequate  funds, space, equipment, and trained  staff.  To make matters even worse,  the  lack of adequate education programs  is further complicated by the nature  of the prison population. As noted by  the National Advisory Council on Vo cational Education  in  its  excellent  report, Vocational Education in Cor rectional Institutions:  The typical inmate is a 25 year old male,  with an uncertain educational background,  limited marketable skills, and few positive  work experiences. He completed no more  than 10 high school grades and functions 2  to 3 grade levels below that. He is likely to  be poor, having earned less than $10,000 in  the year prior to his arrest.  Although the U.S. prison population is 96  percent male, the plight of the incarcerated  woman cannot be overlooked. She is typical ly under 30, a single mother with two or  more children, poor and on welfare. She is  likely to have problems with physical and/  or mental health, drugs and/or alcohol.  This  situation  does  not  improve  when a person is released from prison.  The unemployment rate among ex-of fenders is three times the rate for the  general public. Those that do find jobs  often work in low-income, semiskilled  positions. If they do not commit an other crime, many ex-felons end their  lives  in suicide or dereliction among  the skid row population. As Chief Jus tice Warren Burger put it so eloquent ly:  Ninety-five percent of the adults who are  presently confined in our nation's prisons  will eventually return to freedom. Without  any positive change, including learning mar ketable skills, a depressing number-prob ably more than half of these inmates-will  return to a life of crime after their release.  The situation is, in fact, even more  distressing than that described by the  Chief  Justice. Sixty  to  seventy-five  percent of the 150,000 offenders re leased from institutions each year will  return to crime, and 30 to 50 percent  will be recommitted to prison within 1  year. Among juveniles, the rate of re cidivism reaches as high as 80 percent.  In response to this deplorable set of  circumstances, the Chief Justice pro posed in his 1981 report to the Ameri can Bar Association the introduction  of mandatory educational and voca tional programs  for all  inmates. He  urged that every inmate who could not  read, write, spell, and do simple arith metic would be given that training. In  addition,  the Chief  Justice  recom mended a large expansion of vocation al  training  in  the skilled and semi skilled  crafts .. His  recommendations  were not only echoed but amplified  and expanded upon by the report of  the National Advisory Council on Vo cational Education  to which  I have  previously  ref erred.  That  report  should be required reading for every  public official in this country.  The Chief  Justice's  recommenda tions, combined with those of the Na tional Advisory Council on Vocational  Education, clearly point to the need  for a greater Federal commitment in  the corrections education area. To my  mind, their observations and findings  provide the strongest support possible  for the legislative initiative embodied  in this bill. In addition, they are but tressed by  the  results of studies  in  California, Maryland, New Mexico,  Texas, and Washington which corre late a reduction in the recidivism rate  to the education and training received  by the inmate while in prison.  Mr. President,  the Federal correc tional education assistance would au thorize $25 million a year in grants to  State education agencies. The size of a  grant would be determined by  the  ratio of a State's inmate population to  the  total  inmate population  in  all  States, but no State would receive less  than $100,000. The States would be  permitted great latitude in fashioning  programs to meet their own specific  needs and conditions. Funds could be  used for a variety of educational pro grams, including:  One, academic programs  for basic  education, special education, second ary school credit, postsecondary edu cation,  fine  arts,  recreation,  and  health.  Two, vocational training programs.  Three,  library development and li brary services.  Four, teacher training in correction al education, particularly in social edu cation, reading instruction, and abnor mal psychology.  Five, educational  release programs  for off enders with special attention on  vocational work release training pro grams.  Six,  guidance  programs,  including  testing, counseling, psychological eval qation, and placement services.  Seven, supportive servic.es, with spe cial emphasis upon job placement and  coordination of  educational  services  with other agencies furnishing services  to criminal off enders after their re lease.  Eight,  cooperative  programs with  private business and industry to pro vide both  job  training and employ ment opportunities for off enders.  Mr. President, this marks the third  time since 1979 that I have introduced  legislation of this nature. I am very  encouraged that this year the serious  situation which this bill addresses will  be the subject of a hearing to be con ducted in conjunction with the reau thorization hearings on the Vocational  Education Act. This is a significant de velopment, and I want to take this op",1983
118,626,3,Mr.  FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AUTHORIZATIONS  PERCY.," Mr. President, by re quest, I introduce for appropriate ref erence three bills concerning foreign  assistance authorizations.  These bills have been requested by  the Department of State and I am in troducing  them  in order  that  there  may be a specific bill to which Mem bers of the Senate and the public may  direct their attention and comments.  I  reserve my  right  to support or  oppose these bills, as well as any sug gested amendments to them, when the  matters are considered by the Com mittee on Foreign Relations.  I ask unanimous consent that the  bills be printed in the RECORD at this  point, together with section-by-section  analyses of  the bills and  the letter  from  the Secretary of State  to  the  President of the Senate dated Febru ary 19, 1983.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  THE SECRETARY OF STATE,  Washington, D.C., February 19, 1983.  Hon. GEORGE BusH,  President of the Senate.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I herewith transmit,  on behalf of the President, three bills: a bill  to authorize supplemental assistance to aid  Lebanon  in  rebuilding  its  economy  and  armed forces, and for other purposes; a bill  to authorize supplemental international se curity assistance for urgent purposes for the  fiscal year 1983, and for other purposes; and  a bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act  of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act to  authorize security and development assist ance programs for the fiscal years 1984 and  1985, and for other purposes.  These bills will authorize programs that  are essential elements  in  the Administra tion's overall  foreign and defense policy.  Through  security  assistance,  the United  States helps allies and friendly governments  defend themselves against external thfeats  and deal with the economic, social, and po litical weaknesses that lead to instability.  The economic and development assistance  programs express  the traditional humani tarian concerns of the American people by  playing  an  essential  role  in  combatting  hunger, disease, and poverty, while at the  same time assisting developing countries to  achieve equitable economic growth. These  programs seek to reach these objectives by,  among other things, emphasizing the devel opment of essential institutions and produc tive, self-sustaining private sectors in these  countries.

119,678,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, on behalf  of myself and Senators HEFLIN  and  THURMOND, I am pleased to introduce  the Court Improvements Act of 1983.  The most significant of the reforms  included in the package is the creation  of an intercircuit tribunal to exercise  jurisdiction over cases ref erred to it by  the Supreme Court.  The purpose of the tribunal is to re lieve the dramatically increased work load of the Supreme Court. In recent  months,  in highly unusual  fashion,  eight  Justices  of  the Court  have  spoken publicly about the problem of  docket congestion. A few weeks ago,  the Chief Justice of the United States  specifically endorsed the creation of a  temporary intercircuit tribunal to help  alleviate the growing overload.  For  years,  judicial  commentators  and scholars have tracked the alarm ing rise in the number of cases before  the Court. In the Court's past session,  there were more than 6,000 petitions  for  certiorari,  an  increase of more  than 80 percent over the past 10 years.  Of  sheer  necessity,  an  increasing  number of  these  requests  for High  Court review were decided in summa ry, or per curiam fashion.  Almost 10  years ago,  the Hruska  Commission, which was established to  study  the Federal appellate system,  recommended that a national court of  appeals be created to serve as a safety  valve  for an  increasingly overloaded  and overworked Supreme Court.  In  the  intervening years,  the pressures  which  led  to  this  recommendation  have intensified and the Hruska pro posal has continued to receive interest  and support. In this and the past Con gress, Senator HEFLIN, the ranking mi nority member of the Courts Subcom mittee, has proposed the creation of a  permanent National Court of Appeals  along the lines recommended by the  Hruska Commission, and his well-rec ognized expertise in this area was in strumental in the development of this  intercircuit tribunal proposal.  The intercircuit tribunal can be an  important new tool to ease the alarm ing burdens on the Court.  The elements of  the proposal are  straight-forward: A  temporary court  would be created for a 5-year period to  settle important matters ref erred to it  by the Supreme Court. The proposal  follows  the recommendations of  the  Hruska Commission in that the tribu nal would have no original  jurisdic tion. It would decide only cases which  the Supreme Court ref erred to it by  majority vote. The Supreme Court  would retain the power to overrule or  modify any decision of the tribunal,  consistent with its constitutional role  as the highest court in the land.  The circuit council of each circuit  court of appeals would nominate two  judges to sit on the 26-member tribu nal. Five judge panels would then be  formed within  the  tribunal  to hear  and decide cases. No two judges from  the same circuit could sit on the same  panel. Judges would be designated to  sit on panels by a  lottery system in  such a way that all judges of the tribu nal would hear and decide cases that  represent all types of cases before the  tribunal.  The  legislation  also  incorporates  Senator HEFLIN's proposal to establish  a Chancellor of the United States who  would be appointed by the Chief Justice from among circuit judges in regu lar  active  service. The Chancellor  would be responsible for assisting the  Chief Justice with the ever increasing  administrative burdens of the position  of Chief Justice. He would also serve  as a member of the intercircuit tribu nal and be responsible for the adminis tration of that court.  Mr. President, this proposal consti tutes a balanced and cost-efficient re sponse to the Supreme Court's urgent  need  for  relief  from  its burgeoning  caseload. Because  the proposal does  not involve the creation of new judge ships, nor the establishment of a sepa rate administrative support structure,  its costs should be minimal. In addi tion, the temporary nature of the tri bunal should address the reservations  of some about creating a new appel late layer to the Federal court struc ture in the form of a permanent Na tional Court of Appeals. Rather, this  5-year  experiment will  provide  the  Congress with  needed  information  concerning the feasibility and wisdom  of  taking such a step. At the same  time, the tribunal will provide desper ately needed additional decisional ca pacity for  the resolution of disputes  where  nationwide  uniformity  is  needed, many of which are now left  unresolved  because  the  Supreme  Court cannot make room on its docket.  The remaining components of  this  court improvements package consist of  proposals which are similar or identi cal to bills which were introduced in  the last Congress. All were mentioned  in the year end report of the Chief  Justice as needed improvements in ju dicial administration.  First,  title  I would  eliminate  the  mandatory  jurisdiction  of  the  Su preme Court. Under current law, cer tain cases may be appealed directly to  the Supreme Court and the Court is  obligated  to hear and decide  them.  The majority of these cases do not in volve important issues, are summarily  dealt with, and essentially serve only  to clog the Court's docket.  Identical  proposals have passed at  least one  House of Congress in the past three  Congresses.  Title II would eliminate most civil  priorities. Over the past several years,  the Congress has enacted so many  statutory  provisions  requiring  the  courts to give expedited consideration  to certain civil cases, that they have  become virtually meaningless.

150,743,3,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, Lincoln  University has a  rich and distinctive  history in the life of the State of Mis souri and our Nation.  It was founded as an institution of  higher education in 1866 to provide for  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the academic and intellectual develop ment of  the sons and daughters of  former  slaves.  Lincoln  University,  therefore, has a specialness in the very  lifeblood of black Americans because it  offers  through the provision of aca demic and intellectual skills a conduit  for black Americans to enter the socio economic mainstream of American so ciety.  To that extent, it is very dear and  much cherished by black Americans.  It is most important that this peculiar  heritage of Lincoln University and its  precious roots be maintained and ex tended in the present and future.  It should be noted as a matter of his torical record that Lincoln University  has always, as is true of other predom inantly black colleges and universi ties-namely, Howard, Morgan, Talla dega, Hampton, and so forth-founded  during  the same period, opened  its  doors to all races. Lincoln University  must  remain,  in  the  present  and  future, a vital and creative part of  black America.  In this connection, Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues  a  position  paper  prepared  by Dr.  Willie  J. Kimmons  regarding  the  maintenance of the heritage of Lin coln University.  The paper follows:  MAINTAINING THE HISTORICAL HERITAGE AND  INTEGRITY OF LINCOLN UNIVERSITY  <By Willie J. Kimmons>  According  to Randolph Bracy,  Jr.,  the  major goal of Black institutions of higher  learning is the development of strategies for  preparing Black people with the essential  skills to govern and compete in the Black  Community  and  the American  society.  (""The Black Private College and Strategies  for its Survival,"" Journal of Negro Educa tion, Vol XLIX, No. l, 1980.)  In 1866, shortly after the Civil War, a  group of Black men had a vision and saw a  need for a Black institution of higher learn ing in the Jefferson City, Missouri area. Be cause they had no financial backing they  decided  to contribute some of  their own  earnings. Thus in 1866, because members of  the 62nd and the 65th colored  infantries  had a vision and decided to contribute from  their personal earnins, Lincoln Institute was  created. This dream encouraged by other in dividuals became a reality and on Septem ber 17, 1866 Lincoln opened its doors for the  first time to Black students desiring a post high school education. Twenty four years  later, in 1890 the State of Missouri estab lished Lincoln as a land-grant institution of  higher  learning.  In 1921,  this  institution  became Lincoln University.  Since  its  inception,  this  institution has  broadened  the horizons of  thousands of  Black young men and women by helping  them  to  realize  their potential  to  fulfill  themselves, serve humanity, and stand-up in  support of the dignity of all persons. The  tradition upon which Lincoln University  was founded, nurtured and developed must  remain as strong and true today and tomor row as it was yesterday.  According to Dennis Daily Murphy, one of  the major goals of Black institutions is to  provide  creditable models  for  aspiring  youth. He stresses the importance of young  3467  Black men and Black women seeing other  Blacks managing important affairs and ad ministering  important  enterprises.  <""The  Future of Predominantly Black Public Col leges and Universities,"" Urban Education,  Vol. 16, No. 1, April, 1981.)  Faustine  Jones  emphasizes  that  since  their founding, the worth of Black Colleges  is very often substantiated by quantitative  measures such as the number of graduates.  From a quantitative perspective, most of the  teachers,  lawyers, physicians, social work ers, and other Black professionals who have  made significant contributions or who have  attained outstanding social distinction are  alumni of Black Colleges. (""In appreciation:  The Worth of Black Colleges"" Journal of  Negro Education, Vol. 50, No. 3, 1981.)  One of the outstanding strengths of Lin coln University  is  the pride and commit ment of  its  graduates. These  graduates  along with the faculty and staff are dedicat ed  to advancing excellence  in  the  liberal  arts,  in the professions, and technical ca reers. A few of  its outstanding graduates  are:  Mr. William Gillespie, National President,  Lincoln  University  Alumni  Association,  Chesterfield, Missouri.  Mr. Paul Thornton, Assistant Director, In ternal Revenue Service, Detroit Office, De troit, Michigan.  Mr. Jesse Hill, Jr., President, The Atlanta  Life Insurance Co., Atlanta, Georgia.  Mr. Thomas Shropshire, Vice President,  Miller Brewery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Dr. Henry Givens, President, Harris-Stowe  College, St. Louis, Missouri.  Mr. Stanley Scott, Vice President, Phillip  Morris, New York, New York.  Mrs. Barbara Vance, Staff Facilitator, Col lege of Education, Wayne State University,  Detroit, Michigan.  Dr. Lionel Newsome, President, Central  State University, Wilberforce, Ohio.  Mr. Earl Wilson, Marketing Director for  European Countries, I.B.M.  Dr. Queen Randall, President, El Centro  Community College, Dallas, Texas.  Dr. Odell Nails, Superintendent, Pontiac  Public Schools, Pontiac, Michigan.  Mr.  Julius Hollis, Corporate Attorney,  General Motors, Detroit, Michigan.  Dr. Roy Cheatham, Dean, St. Louis Uni versity, St. Louis, Missouri.  Lincoln University graduates have distin guished themselves across this nation. Lin coln has produced and will  continue  to  produce some of the greatest role-models  and  image-builders  this  country has  to  offer. It has graduated some of the greatest  minds that have competed and contributed  at all levels and in every facet of American  life. Indeed the Alumni Association is en gaged in many exemplary efforts promoting  excellence in education and in maintaining  the University's historical integrity, person al, and professional growth throughout its  local chapters in more than 20 cities across  the United States of America. The Associa tion will continue  to support the mission  and goals of the institution and will contin ue their dedication to educating Black stu dents,  to all young people,  and  to our  nation.  Historically Black Universities  such  as  Lincoln provide opportunities for Black men  and women with advanced degrees to find  positions to teach and administer in a more  congenial and more comfortable settings.  According to Andrew Billingsley, among the  nation's more than three thousand predomi nantly white colleges and universities, less  than one percent of the faculties are Black.  ",1983
151,756,3,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on  December 7, 1982, an article on the nu clear  freeze  resolutions now before  Congress, entitled ""Cold, Hard Facts  on the Freeze,"" appeared in the Wash ington Post. This piece was written by  the Honorable Congressman ALBERT  GoRE, JR., of Tennessee. This provoca tive, penetrating look at the nuclear  freeze issue deserves this body's atten tion, and I encourage my colleagues to  take the time to consider Congressman  GoRE's views.  ""Cold, Hard Facts on the Freeze"" is  an article  that clearly demonstrates  the futility in this Congress assuming  a negative role on the Reagan adminis tration's policies  toward  the Soviet  Union. ""What looms ahead for Con gress,"" Congressman GoRE writes, ""is a  protracted struggle over the future of  nuclear weapons,  on  a  system-by system basis, without benefit of any  common  framework  for  evaluating  each one and debating its merits in re lation to an agreed national strategic  plan.""  This  is a sizable challenge  indeed,  but it is a challenge that we must meet  as  soon  as  possible.  Congressman  GoRE's article could prove useful  in  setting this new course.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the article be printed in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  COLD, HARD FACTS ON THE FREEzE  (By ALBERT GORE, Jr.)  During the next two years, Congress, and  the House in particular, is likely to be the  scene of a major crisis in our nation's de fense policy. Enormous federal deficits will  demand major  reductions  in government  spending. Those cuts are not all going to  come out of social programs, and therefore  many will come out of the military budget.  ,And in the military budget, nothing is more  visible  and vulnerable  than  the nuclear  weapons program: big-ticket  items whose  value  to  the national  security has been  sharply challenged by  the nuclear freeze  movement.  Among the nuclear weapons program, the  one with  the least chance for survival  is  clearly the MX missile. But there are al ready indications that other programs, in cluding the Pershing II missile for NATO  and, very likely, the Bl, again, will be chal lenged. Other programs,  including cruise  missiles  and  the Trident D5  submarine launched missile, have their critics too, but  are not as  likely-for  the  time being, at  least-to be at the center of controversy <al though even this judgment may have to be  modified,  in  the case of ground-launched  cruise missiles for Europe).  We can expect President Reagan to show  very little flexibility  in this area. He will  insist that the country requires all  these  weapons systems, and he will charge that if  Congress refuses to fund them, it must take  responsibility for weakening the national se curity, diminishing Soviet interest in arms  control,  and  ultimately,  increasing  the  hazard of war.  Proponents of the freeze reject this logic,  and are likely to have enough votes in the  next Congress to ensure that Reagan's argu ments for major nuclear weapons programs  across the board are rejected.  This having been done, however, members  of Congress will then have to face the hard  facts  that < 1) Reagan will not adopt the  freeze programs as his own, because to do so  would require him to abjure everything he  believes about dealing with the Soviets; (2)  funding decisions for nuclear weapons pro grams will have to be taken by Congress  without benefits of an arms control frame work; <3> new or modified Soviet nuclear  weapons systems will continue  to appear  and  to move  toward deployment, and <4>  public opinion, which has been inspired to  doubt the value of nuclear superiority, has  never lost its repugnance for conceding it to  the Soviet Union by unilateral actions.  What looms ahead for Congress,  there fore, is a protracted struggle over the future  of nuclear, weapons, on a system-by-system  basis, without  benefit  of  any  common  framework for evaluating each one and de bating its merits in relation to an agreed na tional strategic plan.  The president's philosophy will not serve  for this purpose, but neither will that of the  freeze movement. On  the day after  the  House  passes  a  resolution  affirming  its  desire for a mutual, bilateral freeze with the  Soviet Union, it must nevertheless continue  to decide the fate of U.S. nuclear weapons  in the absence of such an agreement, or  even of the hope for one while Reagan is in  office.  Congressional advocates of a  freeze will  face an especially painful dilemma. A pat tern of votes against nuclear weapons programs adds up to unrequited concessions to  the Soviet Union. But a pattern of votes in  favor of such weapons adds up to approval  of a process  that will  rapidly erode  the  freeze as a viable policy for a future admin istration.  What we lack today, and what the next  Congress will urgently need, is a standard  that will  help us  reach better-informed  judgments as to what kind of nuclear pos ture we should have, as to what kinds of nu clear weapons programs are compatible with  that posture, and as to how these decisions  affect the stability of the nuclear balance  and prospects for reaching an agreement  with the Soviets.  Two months ago, I joined with Reps. Les  Aspin, Thomas Downey, and Joel Pritchard  to introduce a  resolution suggesting what  this standard ought to be.  The United States and the Soviet Union  are heading  toward a situation  in which  each will have the ability to menace a sig nificant  portion  of  the  other's nuclear  forces; specifically, the land-based ICBMs,  which are the most accurate and in many  ways the premier weapons systems.  Our response to the ICBM vulnerability  problem has been the development of two  new generations of ballistic missiles:  the  MX, for depolyment on land, and the Tri dent II D5, for deployment at sea. Each will  mark an increase in the number and accura cy of U.S. ballistic missile warheads, such  that either system, and certainly the two to gether, will constitute a threat to all Soviet  ICBM silos.  The increasing vulnerability of U.S. land based forces, and the coming vulnerability  of Soviet land-based forces, are trends that  are fraught with danger. Mutual fear of a  first strike is highly destabilizing and mark edly increases the risk of nuclear war, while  putting at risk any prospect for meaningful  arms control.  Congress should recognize this fear of a  first strike as the central issue in judging  whether existing deployments are adequate,  for deciding what new deployments make  sense, and for assessing whether arms con trol  is on the right  track. In the highly  charged tension between the U.S. and the  U.S.S.R.,  even  a  hypothetical  advantage  gained by striking first is dangerous and de stabilizing, because  it generates  fear and  raises the specter of political intimidation.  Our resolution states that, as part of the  strategic  arms  reduction  negotiations  CST ART>.  the United  States  and  the  U.S.S.R.:  < 1) Should place the highest priority on  efforts to reduce and eliminate the fear by  either  nation  of  a  nuclear  first  strike  against it by the other.  <2> Should seek a verifiable agreement  that produces stability in the strategic rela tionship between the two nations by ensur ing  that a nuclear first strike would not  confer upon the attacking nation even a hy pothetical advantage.  To grasp this framework and apply it, the  president need not repudiate his view of the  world, but rather, modify and refine it. In  theory,  the next Congress might seek  to  bind the president to freeze measures by  threatening  to block major spending bills  until he gives in. I hope we will avoid that  kind of confrontation, but to do so requires  the development of a bipartisan consensus  on the nuclear problem, rather than polar ization of the debate.  The freeze resolution, which I have sup ported, states an ideal we are not going to  see realized, or even pursued, by the present  ",1983
152,782,3,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased today to join as a cospon sor of Senate Resolution 77 offered by  my distinguished colleague from New  York, Senator D'AMATo. Senate Reso lution 77 will deny  the deferral of  funding for much-needed assistance to  our Nation's mass transit capital facili ties. These funds are of critical impor tance to my State of New Jersey and  other States which are dependent on  mass transit for their economic well being.  In the gas tax legislation passed by  the Congress and signed by the Presi dent, mass transit was to receive 1 cent  of  the 5-cent  increase  in  revenues.  This was an  important victory  for  mass  transit  and  a  credit  to  the  wisdom of the Senate. It was also a  tribute  to the efforts of the Senate  Committee on Banking and Urban Af fairs, its chairman Senator GARN and  its  entire  membership.  Senator  D' AMATO worked particularly hard to  insure that mass  transit capital and  operating needs received the attention  they deserve.  Yet, it was not long before the ad ministration moved to impose substan tial cuts in mass transit, far out of pro portion to any other surface transpor tation reductions. Should this be al lowed to happen, mass transit's victory  of last year will have been a brief and  bitter one indeed.  Again, I join my esteemed colleague  in his effort  to  restore  these badly  needed funds.   NOTICES OF HEARINGS  COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET  Mr. DOMENIC!.

Madam President, on occasion you  have an opportunity to know individ uals, but you really get to know them  when you work with them in the deci sionmaking process.  Making decisions probably is one of  the hardest things we have to do. But  when we give up the right to make de cisions, we are giving up something  very precious.  I want to pay tribute  to my good  friend, the distinguished Senator from  Maryland. I found that he is a man of  patience, a man who has never lost his  good humor. On  the many  times  I  have dealt with him in all of the seem ingly minor details that seem to keep  coming and coming, he has never lost  his good humor. I think he ought to  be complimented for his fairness also.  Madam President, I want to compli ment the staff of the Rules Commit tee on both sides of the aisle. They  worked as one, made decisions in help ing each other, and came up with rec ommendations to give the members of  the committee an opportunity to make  the ultimate recommendations to the  Senate under this resolution.  Madam President,  I do not  think  that I should sit down without compli menting the staff members of the vari ous committees which came before us  in presenting  their  committee's  re quests. I found that those staff mem bers that came with the various com mittees were well qualified, intelligent,  knew what they were talking about,  and walked the thin line of protecting  their committees while answering the  questions that were posed to them by  our committee members.  So I compliment the committees on  the staffs that they had representing  them before us.  Madam President, I hope there will  be no amendments to this resolution  and  that we  can proceed with  the  adoption of what I think is a landmark  piece of legislation.  ",1983

162,821,3,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Chairman,  the Committee on  Science  and Technology  joins  the  Committee on Education and Labor in  supporting H.R.  1310,  proposing  a  broad and comprehensive bill to deal  with what has been termed a crisis in  science  and math  education. H.R.  1310, while comprehensive in nature is  not seen by either committee as a solu tion to all the problems confronting  our educational system  today  in sci ence, math, engineering, and technolo gy. Rather it should be viewed as a  first  step-although  an  important  one-in a series of steps to be taken  collaboratively by the Federal Govern ment with State and  local govern ments,  academia,  business  and  the  other elements of the concerned pri vate  sector. True  resolution of  the  problems will  require  a  protracted  effort on everyone's part  to  reverse  the present trends of our educational  system and meet our human resource  needs of tomorrow.  Chairman,  both  committees  have had extensive hearings on  the  issue of science and math education  and its impact on the Nation's trained  technical, engineering or scientific per sonnel. The Science Committee held  five series of hearings in the last Con gress as well as a final set of hearings  in this Congress. The last day, in fact,  we heard from over 20 witnesses repre senting industry, academia, State and  local governments and various prof es sional and educational groups and so cieties. In addition, dozens of confer ences, meetings, and colloquiums have  been held  throughout  the  country  with sponsors including the National  Academy of Sciences,  the American  Association  for  the Advancement of  Science,  the National Association of  Manufacturers, the American AssociaMr.  and  Societies  tion  of  Engineering  many others.  Let me note here a few of the facts  and  ideas we have heard  resulting  from these oversight and investigative  activities:  Fifty percent of new  science and  math teachers at the secondary school  level are unqualified  to  teach  those  subjects.  Fewer than 30 percent of the Na tion's high schools require more than  1 year of science and math.  There currently exists a 9-percent  shortage of engineering faculty at just  the time when engineering course en rollments are increasing.  Overcrowding of classrooms, lack of  advanced  instructional and  research  instrumentation, as well as noncom petitive salaries are attracting young  engineering  faculty  and  instructors  out of the university and into indus try.  Fewer American  engineering  stu dents are entering graduate level pro grams to create the next generation of  teachers and researchers in this area.  To put it another way, we are eating  our  ""seed  corn""-and  that  ""seed  corn"" -our teachers and  instructors,  our researchers and engineers-will be  critical  to  this Nation's future well being.  As the President recently recognized  in his second state of the Union ad dress:  Education,  training  and  retraining  are  fundamental to our success as are research,  development,  and  productivity  . . . We  Americans are still the world's technological  leader in most fields. We must keep that  edge, and to do so we need to begin renew ing the basics-starting with our education al system.  I believe we all agree on the need as  we stand here today. As I have noted,  the problems are quite extensive, un derscoring the need for quick action.  In  the 97th Congress, over 40 bills  were  introduced,  but  none  were  passed. I believe Members who have  studied this problem are now prepared  to act.  The bill before us today represents  the culmination of almost 2 years of  effort by numerous  individuals both  here  in Congress and from outside.  Again, it is not intended to be a single  answer to the complex issue confront ing us. Rather, it is a start in the proc ess.  Let me briefly mention  the high lights of the Science Committee's ac tions and recommendations as report ed for consideration on the floor. As  already noted by my distinguished col league from Kentucky, the chairman  of the Education and Labor Commit tee, Congressman CARL PERKINS, H.R.  1310 has two parts, title I-the ""Engi neering Mathematics and Science Edu cation and Jobs Act"" and title II-the  ""National Engineering  and  Science  Personnel Act of 1983."" The elementary and secondary portion of title I was  considered  solely by  the Education  Committee; the other portions of title  I  jointly by our two committees; and  title II solely by the Science Commit tee.  In the title I activities considered by  the Science Committee we found our selves in agreement with the Educa tion Committee as to the actual activi ties to be taken, although there were  some changes  in responsibilities and  resources allocated between  the De partment of Education and  the Na tional Science Foundation. These in cluded:  A special national teacher incentive  scholarship program  to be adminis tered by the Department for providing  new elementary and secondary math  and critical foreign language teachers.  A special national teacher incentive  scholarship program  to be  adminis tered by the Department for providing  new elementary and secondary math  teachers, and teachers of critical for eign language.  Summer institutes and workshops to  be operated by both the foundation  and the Department aimed at improv ing teaching skills.  Postsecondary mathematics, science,  and foreign language improvement at  institutions of higher education; and  investigations of effective educational  methods and programs.  In title II the major thrust is two fold. One, to establish a clear policy as  to the Federal role in maintaining an  adequate supply of properly qualified  technical,  engineering and  scientific  personnel. Second, to establish a spe cial matching  fund administered by  the National Science Foundation. This  cost-sharing fund would focus on the  following:  Recruitment and retention of new  engineering faculty.  Two-year and community college, as  well as  four-year  institution  faculty  development in high technology and  scientific fields.  Instructional  Instrumentation with  special emphasis on computer accessi bility in post secondary institutions.  Precollege science programs includ ing the use of industrial personnel and  resources in education programs; and  the promotion of public understanding  of science and mathematics.  The funding level in title I as report ed by our committee was $325 million  for fiscal year 1984; in title II $100 mil lion per year is authorized for a 5-year  period beginning in fiscal year 1984.  The total amount in fiscal year 1984  would be $425 million.  Although $425 million  is a  lot of  money, I would note that the Nation  now spends over $200 billion annually  for our public education enterprise.  The $425 million is less than one-quar ter of 1 percent of $200 billion. Given  the crisis we have all acknowledged as  ",1983
163,834,3,Mr. CHANDLER.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to commend the chairmen  and members of the Committees on  Science and Technology and Educa tion and Labor for the work they have  done on H.R. 1310,  the Emergency  Mathematics and Science Education  Act. I join my colleagues in support of  the concepts and  intended goals of  H.R. 1310. This  legislation will not  solve all of our problems, but it is an  important effort by the Congress  to  provide leadership and to put a nation al  focus  on  the need  for qualified  teachers. Until we as a nation recog nize the importance of teachers in our  children's  lives, and pay  them com mensurately,  the problems with em ploying and  retaining  teachers who  can inspire students to learn will con tinue. The pay issue must, of course,  be addressed at the State and  local  level, but I hope that passage of this  legislation today will serve to empha size how serious we  think  the prob lems are.  During the past decade the United  States has experienced a serious de cline  in  the quality of education  in  mathematics and science. Most alarm ing to me was an article in the March  1982 issue of Education Week indicat ing that since 1972 there has been a  77-percent decline  in  the number of  secondary-level mathematics teachers  prepared in 600  teacher-training pro grams nationwide. Among newly em ployed science and mathematics teach ers, 50.2 percent were judged by princi pals  to be unqualified  to  teach  in  those fields but had been employed on  an emergency basis because school of ficials could not find qualified teach ers.  This shortage of mathematics and  science  teachers hampers the ability  of the schools to provide the quality  curriculum and  instruction so neces sary to academic achievement. During  an age of technological advances, it is  incumbent upon us to provide our stu dents with the necessary skills to com pete in today's society. I think this leg islation we are considering here today  is an important first step which could  well determine this country's leader ship role as we advance into the 21st  century. I urge my colleagues to sup port H.R. 1310 because I feel that in  order to achieve academic excellence  tomorrow, we must make a commit ment to education today.  0 1445  ",1983
164,834,3,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Chairman, we  have no further requests for time, and  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983
165,834,3,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 3 minutes  to  the distinguished  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  RITTER).  ",1983
166,834,3,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Chairman, we do  indeed  face  a  crisis  in  science and  math education. And I do believe that  H.R.  1310 makes  a  good  first-step  effort.  Speaking as a former scientist, engi neering professor, former member of  the Science and Technology Commit tee, someone who has been deeply con cerned  in his own district with  this  question of better math and science  education, I see H.R. 1310 as a major  effort to increase the flow of science  and math  teachers  in  the pipeline;  that is,  to educate,  to  train, and  to  make available, I think H.R. 1310 goes  a long way. It makes a yeoman effort.  But the problem is going to occur at  the other end of the pipeline. Once  the teachers are prepared, will the op portunity  be  there  in  a way  that  people can provide for their families in  somewhat similar fashion  than  they  can do were they to work in the pri vate sector?  I submit that that question is not  yet addressed. In reponse to a previous  statement, we are not in a postindus trial age; we are in a new  industrial  age. We will continue to build cars, we  will continue  to make steel, we will  continue  to produce chemicals. This.  country is not to be turned into one  large Silicon Valley where everybody  is making Ataris.  Incidentally, Atari  just shipped 1,700 jobs to Taiwan and  Hong Kong. No;  it  is  the  infusion  throughout America of new  technol ogies. And  the prime  sponsors  are  going  to be  those able  to  teach  in  these areas.  I  submit  that opportunities, once  they are  through  the pipeline, once  H.R. 1310 and the system has worked  its will, that opportunity will not be  there if the market forces for talent  are being repressed. The teacher re cruitment and  retention problem  is  largely a matter of economics. Here  are some  interesting aspects of  the  problem.  In a recent study by James Guthrie,  chairman of the School of Education  at University of California the author  noted that the dramatic shortage of  mathematics and science teachers may  doom the United States to a ""second  rate"" future in high technology. The  author noted  that private  industry  offers more  lucrative pay  to people  qualified to teach math and science.  For example in the San Francisco Bay  area,  starting  teachers earn $12,680  while  private  industry  likely would  pay them $20,000, the report said.  The report suggested five tactics for  fighting the high school brain drain in  technical fields. One of the five recom mendations was  to allow  schools  to  off er higher pay  for  these  higher  demand fields.  In Houston  teachers with  critical  skills, such as science and math teach ers will be paid bonuses of $2,000 a  year. If they agree  to  teach  in the  poorer neighborhoods they receive an  additional $2,000. And if they teach in  a school where test scores rise above  the anticipated norm, they get an ad ditional $1,300.  This has  led  to an extremely  low  number of vacancies in these areas in  the city of Houston. Only four vacan cies in math and science.  Many  teachers  are  drifting  away  toward industry at this point and ac cording to Henry Tunis, research di rector  of  the National Council  of  Teachers of Mathematics  it will get  worse as economic recovery progresses.  At that point he notes potential sci ence and math  teachers will  find  it  easier and more rewarding to go into  industry.  Herman L. Carter, personnel super visor for  the Richmond, Va. schools  noted that he received over 300 appli cants for teaching positions after of fering a $1,500 bonus. He noted:  It used to be in some cases that you'd hire  the only  (science) applicant who applied.  Now for the first time we have the opportu nity to pick from them.  In Oklahoma City  the school sys tem's personnel chief is offering math  and science teachers $500 plus an addi tional $100 for each credit hour they  teach. And the result has been an im provement in the situation.  And I know this is a touchy political  situation. Every school administrator,  in fact, many teachers whom I spoke  with back in my district, recognize it  as a touchy situation. But they all rec ognize  that a physics  teacher or a  mathematics teacher does command a  different rate of return and something  has to be done.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog nizes  the gentleman from California  (Mr. BROWN).  ",1983
167,834,3,Mr.  BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise i.11 support of H.R.  1310, as amended, and reported by the  two committees involved, and I com mend the leadership for placing such a  high priority on addressing the emer gency in science and math education.  Chairman FuQuA of the Science and  Technology Committee and Chairman  PERKINS of the Education and Labor  Committee have done an admirable  job of bringing  together  the efforts  and interests of their two committees  in this one bill.  A number of other Members from  both sides of the aisle have also been  involved in fashioning this important  piece of  legislation. The  result  is a  well-balanced bill.  Mr. Chairman,  I am not going  to  detail the merits of this bill nor the  urgency of the problem which has re sulted in its being moved in an expe dited  fashion  to  the  floor.  I would  rather comment very briefly on the  fact that the effort to bring it to the  ",1983
168,860,3,Mr. COLEMAN  of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  ",1983
169,860,3,Mr.  ERLENBORN.,  I  would  be  happy to yield to the gentleman from  Missouri.  ,1983
170,860,3,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I  think the funda mental cliff erence between  the com mittee provision and my amendment is  that a numerical progression will be  made under my amendment, because  if you train one person to be a quali fied math or science teacher, they can  turn that individual youngster on to  go after it, too, on his own, to a college  career in math and science. Instead of  going down to the college level to try  to encourage people, one good teacher  could get 20 or 30 youngsters involved  in math and science and all you have  expended is $5,000. If you do it their  way, you will spend $5,000 times 20 for  the same product. That is the differ ence between the two proposals.  ",1983
171,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr. Chairman, I  might  reiterate  that  the committee  bill will address itself to students al ready qualified  for Pell grants,  for  guaranteed student loans, for national  defense student loans, and work-study  funds. It in no way says that the re ceipt of this $5,000 under the committee bill would disqualify them for the  other aid.  What it may do  is  just add more  money to those we are already invest ing  in,  instead of  taking  those who  have the will to teach, have the desire  to teach, but do not have the qualifica tions  and could be, within a  year,  brought into qualification so that they  could gain employment teaching math  and science.  Mr. McCURDY. Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
172,860,3,Mr.  ERLENBORN.,  I  would  be  happy to yield to the gentleman from  Oklahoma.  ,1983
173,860,3,Mr. MCCURDY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted  to clarify  perhaps what is a misleading impres sion.  This is not a $5,000 grant. This is  based on  the need,  the  tuition and  books and the basic costs of attending  a  university or college, not  to  fall  below  $1,000.  So  it would  not  be  $5,000. Tuition and books at the Uni versity of Oklahoma is $750,  in that  range,  so we are not  talking about  $5,000.  ",1983
174,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," If I may recap ture my time from the gentleman, I  have not read the bill that thoroughly,  but my cursory glance at it shows no  needs test in the bill. It did not show  any disqualification  for one seeking  one of these scholarships if they al ready have a Pell grant,  if they al ready have a guaranteed student loan  or a national defense student loan.  The gentleman could correct me if I  am wrong, but I did not find that in  the bill.  Mr. McCURDY. Mr. Chairman,  if  the gentleman would yield on  that  point, these scholarships are based on  merit. People that demonstrate ability  and want to go into that area, this is  an incentive to stay in the profession.  ",1983
175,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Will the gentle man address the question, though.  Mr. McCURDY. There is  language  in the report that indicates that need  should be addressed, that need is a cri teria when the committee makes a se lection.  ",1983
176,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr. Chairman, I  just cannot resist the opportunity to  give a little lesson in writing the law  that I think is forgotten.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from  Illinois <Mr. ERLEN BORN) has expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. ERLEN BORN was allowed to proceed for 2 ad ditional minutes.)  ",1983
177,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr. Chairman,  just because this is so often misunder stood by my colleagues, let me reiter ate something that I have to often say  in our committee: If the law is unam biguous on its face, we do not even  look at the committee report. We do  not even look at the floor debate. Only  if there is ambiguity in the language  of the  law does  the court have  the  ability or the authority to look at the  committee  report  or  at  the  floor  debate to determine what we meant in  the bill.  As far as I am aware, there is no am biguity here  that would  cause  the  courts to look to the committee report.  ",1983
178,860,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
179,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN., I am happy to  yield to the gentleman from Illinois.  ,1983
180,860,3,Mr. SIMON.," The gentleman is cor rect in saying that there is no ambigui ty because the law says cost of attend ance is the maximum amount permit ted. So if somebody is receiving a Pell  grant or something else, that is taken  into consideration.  ",1983
181,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.,"  I  ask my col league, does  this say cost of attend ance less grants and loans already re ceived? Cost of attendance is a phrase  of art.  ",1983
182,860,3,Mr. SIMON.," It certainly is a phrase  of art, but the total that is permitted,  if you have the book there, on page 52  at the top of the page you will see that  the maximum you can receive in total  is the cost of attendance.  ",1983
183,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," If I  remember  correctly, we have even charts  that  show what the cost of attendance is at  each of the institutions, because that is  also a factor in determining the eligibil ity of those who are looking for Pell  grants, and so forth.  ",1983
184,860,3,Mr. SIMON., The gentleman is pre cisely correct.  ,1983
185,860,3,Mr. ERLENBORN.," But cost of at tendance, as far as I am aware, in no  case looks to the student's own capac ity to pay, nor does it look to what aid  they have gotten. Cost of attendance  is tuition, fees, the cost of transporta tion, room and board, and it does not  look to these other factors.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from  Illinois <Mr. ERLEN BORN) has again expired.  <On request of Mr. GOODLING and by  unanimous  consent, Mr.  ERLENBORN  was allowed to proceed for 1 additional  minute.)

Mr. Chairman, I take this time only  to point out that my concern during  our debate on this issue, as the gentle man from Illinois knows, is that we do  not know whether someone should be  a  teacher until after they have done  their student teaching.

189,873,3,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. Chairman,  if  I  may address that in this way, I would  anticipate  that  it goes  beyond  the  issue of expenses. Expenses are  the  cost of going to the institute, the cost  of food, and the cost of lodging at the  institute. It does not include the time  that is taken away from that teacher's  ability to earn an extra income in the  summer.  ",1983

193,873,3,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Chairman, if the  gentleman will yield  further,  I was  going to say that I  think it does not  create mischief, and  I would be  in clined to accept the amendment. If we  do find that it is something that is out  of the ordinary, then we may have to  correct  it  in conference, but under  that assumption-and I know the gen tleman  from New Hampshire  has  worked very hard on the bill and has  been  very  interested  in  this-and  based on the good faith explanation, I  would be inclined to accept the amend ment.

197,873,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. Chairman, without  agreeing with that last statement, I  think what we do is two things: No. l,  we take a look at what the experience  really was under NBEA, and, No. 2, we  take a look at the possibility in confer ence of some kind of limitation.  I  am a  little concerned about an  open-ended stipend provision, but  it  seems to me it would be within the  confines and  the  limitations of  the  conference to restrict that. So I would,  with some misgiving,  frankly, be  in clined to accept the amendment with  the understanding that we take a look  at it and work with  the gentleman  from New Hampshire and perhaps put  a restriction on it in conference.

",1983

This just adds a No. 3 section, and  the language says: ""to retain qualified  mathematics and science  teachers at  the elementary and secondary educa tion levels.""  That is all it says.

211,964,3,Mr.  SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am reintroducing legislation,  by request, which would amend the In ternal W.evenue Code of 1954 to pro vide a $30 refundable tax credit to tax payers who vote in a Federal general  elections.  The concept of a voting tax credit is  the brainchild of Mr. Frank Martino,  president of the International Chemi cal Workers Union.  It  proposes  a  voting tax credit as a method to get  more Americans out to vote in Federal  elections. According to the ICWU, the  credit is ""designed to provide an incen tive for all Americans, rich and poor  alike, to exercise their franchise as re sponsible citizens of our country.""  Mr. Speaker, the low percentage of  voter turnout in Federal elections has  become a deplorable situation in this  country. Apathy on the part of eligible  voters has soared, and lately we have  seen trends which indicate that many  Americans do not vote simply because  they are  frustrated with politicians.  More and more Americans seem to be lieve that their vote is not really im portant any more.  The extent of voter alienation is ap parent  in statistics  released by  the  Census Bureau. These figures are dis heartening as well as alarming. In the  1968 Presidential election, there was a  60.9 percent voter turnout. In the 1972  election,  after  18-year-olds  got  the  vote, voter  turnout dropped  to 55.6  percent. And in the latest Presidential  election,  only  53.2  percent  of  the  American population eligible  to vote  participated. The  figures  are  even  more alarming for off-year elections.  In 1970 there was a 43.5-percent turn out compared to 35.5 percent in 1978with a population increase of 21 per cent.  March 2, 1983  The nationwide  decline  in voting  should be of serious concern to anyone  who believes in democracy. One of our  basic freedoms as American citizens is  to choose our public officials through  the election process. Then if we are  not satisfied with those in office, we  can make changes by exercising our  right to vote. Those who cite disillu sionment or disgust with the system as  their reason for not casting a ballot  are simply perpetuating the situation  they dislike. We cannot stand back. It  is  time  for all Americans  to  realize  that our votes do count, and we must  do  something  to  encourage  eligible  voters to participate.  The voting tax credit is one way to  encourage eligible voters to take the  time to vote. Taxpayers who vote in a  Federal general election-or the equiv alent thereto-will receive the credit $60  for a  joint return-by attaching  their  ballot  stub  to  their Federal  income  tax  return.  In  those States  where a ballot stub  is not used,  a  stamp or other document which is evi dence of voting will be issued.  Critics of a voting tax credit argue  that increased voter turnout does not  guarantee  an  improvement  in  the  quality of  legislators being  elected.  Certainly there is some merit to that  argument, but we have to examine the  overall picture. We all have to work  for  improved voter  turnout, but we  also have  to help educate voters so  that they can cast a responsible vote.  I think we owe it to the country to  give this proposal our attention.   POETS ON A COFFEE BREAK  HON. RONALD V.

213,977,3,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  com mend to you and our colleagues the  following  editorial on  the need  for  campaign finance reform, written by  Mark Shields,  the Washington Post,  February 25, 1983.  As a  long time proponent of cam paign finance reform, I believe that we  must move  speedily  on  this  issue,  before the public's confidence in this  institution is completely destroyed by  the events Mr. Shields very correctly  warns cannot be far off.  THE COMING CAMPAIGN SCANDAL  An unconditional prediction: a new federal  campaign  finance  law-one  that  imposes  severe limits on all political action commit tees and provides for some form of public fi nancing of congressional elections-will be  enacted within the next 24 months. While a  majority in Congress and the president now  3701  almost surely oppose any such law, their re sistance will  be overwhelmed by  future  public events. A major political money scan dal will be uncovered that will guarantee  passage of the laws.  All congresses respond to crisis. The crimi nal excesses of Watergate, particularly in  the illegal raising and spending of campaign  funds, probably made  full disclosure and  public funding of presidential campaigns in evitable. We and Congress will learn, sooner  rather  than  later, of another <probably  more than one) major political money scan dal. Once again, promising careers will be  ruined, prison sentences will be handed out  and Congress will pass and the president  will sign a tough new campaign finance law.  Able and committed politicians  in both  parties see the problem clearly. Bob Teeter,  the Republican pollster whose 1976 strategy  brought President Ford from a deficit of 16  million votes to within an eyelash of victory  in 11 weeks, is worried by the rivers of cam paign money now drowning American poli tics: ""It's just like 1972,"" he says. ""There's  too much money around not to have a scan dal."" Missouri Democratic Sen. Tom Eagle ton, who has been winning statewide races  since 1960, argues that contemporary politi cal fund-raising is ""a national scandal"" that  ""is taking place every day."" New York Rep.  Barber Conable, the ranking Republican on  the House Ways and Means Committee, sees  the ever-growing public perception of scan dal in present fund-raising practices as pro ducing more pressure for public financing of  elections. Conable, who  refuses campaign  contributions of more than $50, compares  the existing system of candidates' dunning  all who represent interests before the House  for contributions to his days in private law  practice, when judges running for reelection  raised their compaign budgets by ""putting  the arm on all of us lawyers who appeared  before their court.""  Public financing will not be entirely un welcome. Most candidates would,  if given  the alternative, choose root canal work over  asking anyone for money. Most of the cur rent resistance  to public financing comes  from the Republicans, many of whom, after  telling us  there is no connection between  contributions  and  a  congressman's vote,  then  remind us  that ""there  is  no  free  lunch,"" that every program has a price tag.  Apparently altruism only applies to contri butions by political action committees. But  it will probably make little difference what  anyone argues, because a major scandal will  end the debate and move the previous ques tion.e  RULES  OF  PROCEDURE  AND  STATEMENT  OF  POLICY  ON  PRIVATE IMMIGRATION BILLS  HON.

215,1003,3,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker,  this  morning's Washington Post carried an  excellent lead editorial urging talks in  El Salvador. The Post said:  The doubters fear the bottom is dropping  out. They urge an effort to save the Ameri can investment by promoting negotiations,  talks, ""dialogue."" They are right .... Presi dent Reagan pledged, in his recent Ameri can Legion speech, ""to explore all possibili ties for reconciliation and peace in Central  America."" It is a tall order, and he has yet  to deliver on it.  The Post is hardly alone in calling  for a political settlement in El Salva dor through means including negotiaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tions. Most of our country's major  newspapers-including  the Christian  Science Monitor,  the  Los Angeles  Times, the New York Times, and the  Miami Herald-have endorsed a politi cal route to a settlement in El Salva dor in recent editorials.  These and other editorials reflect a  growing  domestic  and  international  consensus. As chairman of the Sub committee  on Western Hemisphere  Affairs, I have had occasion to meet  with and hear testimony from a great  many of our country's Latin America  experts, and they are virtually unani mous that a political settlement is the  only way out for us in El Salvador. In  the same capacity, I have also traveled  frequently and widely throughout the  region, and it is unquestionably  the  opinion  of  our  democratic  friends  there that we should be seeking a po litical settlement of the war.  No one  is arguing that we should  pull out, or cut and run, or whatever  the administration's current rhetoric  accuses us of wanting. What they do  argue is that our strategy for involve ment  is  fundamentally  flawed. Our  friends  in Latin America want us to  work constructively for a stable, demo cratic El Salvador, an outcome that  cannot be achieved with our current  policy. They do not want us  to go  down with a rapidly sinking ship.  Mr. Speaker, I include at this point a  sampling of recent editorials on this  subject:  .  [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 19831  MORE Am FOR EL SALVADOR?  More aid for El Salvador, as the Reagan  administration requests? Of course. It is an  $80-million-a-year war-that's  the amount  sent la.st year and sought next year. This  year, the foreign aid bill collapsed, leaving  El Salvador short $60 million. Not to pony it  up would probably finish off the govern ment. Is that what the Congress wants or is  ready to take the responsibility for?  The trouble is that the administration and  its critics are drawing divergent conclusions  from the condition that has launched this  latest argument, the sagging of the Salva doran war effort. The administration would  bull through its program of financing the  war <while sending more advisers), trying to  edge  forward  reforms and human  rights,  and cosponsoring  the  local government's  plan to draw the opposition into its electoral  scheme. The doubters fear the bottom  is  dropping out. They urge an effort to save  the American investment by promoting ne gotiations, talks, ""dialogue.""  They  are  right.  The  administration  equates  talks with  letting  the guerrillas  ""shoot their way into power."" But a little  perspective  is  in order. The generals who  are now on top shot their way in. Granted,  at American prodding they have devolved  uncertain power on a body elected since. If  full power had actually been taken by the  body elected a year ago, the administration  would have had fits, since a  feudal party  won. The  point  of  government-guerrilla  talks, their State Department advocates say,  is not to distribute power arbitrarily but to  shape democratic political processes.  It's  certainly  risky.  Increasingly,  it  looks  like  the only alternative.  3727  Secretary of State George Shultz's atti tude is puzzling. He was questioned in the  Senate on the calls for dialogue emanating  from Salvador's acting archbishop and from  Pope John Paul II, whose visit to Salvador  next Sunday is eagerly anticipated by parti sans of reconciliation. Mr. Shultz replied  with a reference to ""churchmen who want  to see Soviet influence in El Salvador im proved."" Separately, he was asked  if the  United States would actively oppose govern ment-guerrilla negotiations even if the Sal vadoran  government were  interested.  ""I  wouldn't think it would be a good idea,"" the  secretary said.  President Reagan pledged,  in his recent  American Legion speech, ""to explore all pos sibilities for reconciliation and peace in Cen tral America."" It is a tall order, and he has  yet to deliver on it.  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 19831  THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR  The military news in El Salvador is the  guerrillas' capture and holding for two days  of Berlin, population 35,000, a city in an in terior province remote from  their strong holds  near  the Honduran  border. Most  American observers have reacted cautiously,  aware perhaps of the exaggerated response  to the communists' Tet offensive  in Viet nam. Still, Berlin was a serious embarrass ment to the government. The guerrillas, re lying on ambushes, sabotage and intimida tion, do not seem to be near a country-wide  military victory. Nor is there evidence that  they have developed a mass following. But  their pressure is constant and perhaps grow ing, and neither  in San Salvador nor  in  Washington  are  the  authorities  certain  what to do.  Some  of  the Salvadoran  government's  probleins are familiar: Nicaragua continues  to augment the guerrillas locally obtained  arins. The Reagan administration has not  gotten from Congress all the military aid it  has sought. Other probleins arise directly  within El Salvador.  The Salvadoran armed forces had a year,  1982,  to use  their new American aid and  training  to  turn the corner, and did not.  They have been slow to adopt the aggres sive, small-unit patrols their American ad visers feel are best suited to routing guerril las. The Americans favor reform, but now  say the armed forces have been ""distracted""  by politics (pushing land reform> and politi cal infighting. Others note that Salvadoran  commanders, uncertain of their troops, have  preferred  the  safer  tactic  of  large-unit  sweeps, and that the government has been  spread thin by having to defend economic  targets.  Some officers have political associations  on the feudal right. One of them, much ad mired by  the Americans  for his military  record, Col: Sigfredo Ochoa,  last month  challenged the reform-minded chief of staff  in what Georgetown University's Robert  Leiken aptly calls an episode pitting ""the  Americans' darling against their right-hand  man.""  There is a sense of a new turning point.  The Americans nervously ask for ""a more  dynamic approach"" by the Salvadorans and  the  transfer of American  advisers  from  training  to  brigade-level  operations. Mr.  Leiken suggests that anti-communist mili tary groups  in El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras and  the Nicaraguan opposition  may join and launch their own combined re gional offensive.  ",1983

MIKE SYNAR  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 2, 1983  e ",1983
217,1016,3,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am introducing legislation to curb un necessary bankruptcies without deny ing bankruptcy  relief  to consumers  who need the ""fresh start"" the bank ruptcy system is designed to provide.  Personal  bankruptcies  have  risen  dramatically  since  the Bankruptcy  Code became effective on October 1,  1979. Three years later bankruptcies  continue to run at an annual rate of  about 450,000, or 200 percent of the  rate for the 12 years prior to enact ment of the code. This rise is inexpli cable, even when coupled with high in terest rates, inflation, unemployment  and  increased  public  awareness  of  bankruptcy from lawyer advertising.  Economic conditions cannot account  for the many debtors who have been  counseled to discharge all of their debt  in a  straight chapter 7 bankruptcy  when they might easily have complet ed repayment of such debts in a court  supervised chapter 13 program.  Some experts believe that as much  as $1 billion of the $6 bi!lion scheduled  in bankruptcy annually is unnecessar ily discharged and can be paid by debt ors without hardship. This $1 billion is  being  paid  by  other  consumers  through higher prices and limitations  on credit availability.  There  is a virtual consensus  that  help is needed. The only question is  how. The legislation I am introducing  today presents a firm middle ground  between the two approaches already  introduced in the 98th Congress: H.R.  1147 by Congressman PETER RODINO  and H.R.  1169  by Congresswoman  MARILYN LLOYD BOUQUARD. Both are  good  bills  that  address  important  problems facing the consumer credit  industry; I believe my bill is a sound  compromise that addresses these prob lems thoroughly while protecting the  vast majority  of  consumer  debtors  who  need  and  deserve  bankruptcy  relief. I am pleased that my Judiciary  Committee  colleagues  Congressmen  BARNEY FRANK, HAL SAWYER, and BILL  McCoLLUM have joined with me today  as cosponsors,  along with Congress men GILLIS  LONG, BUTLER DERRICK,  DICK GEPHARDT, BILL GRAY, VIC FAZIO,  TRENT LoTT, BILL EMERSON, and HAL  DAUB.  March 2, 1983  Our legislation builds upon a hear ing record formed  in the 97th Con gress. In 1981 a consumer bankruptcy  reform bill was introduced which con tained several provisions to modify the  bankruptcy process.  It contained  a  provision which would have allowed a  creditor to challenge the eligibility of  a consumer debtor to take chapter 7  relief based on an ability to pay test. I  did not cosponsor that measure, be lieving another approach could curb  unnecessary bankruptcies while better  protecting  the  rights  of  deserving  debtors.  Our legislation achieves this goal by  following the suggestions of the final  report of  the National Bankruptcy  Commission  that  consumer  debtors  seeking bankruptcy relief be counseled  as to their options before selecting a  chapter 7 straight bankruptcy or a  chapter  13  repayment  plan.  I  am  keenly aware of  the  importance of  credit in the daily lives of millions of  consumers and believe that counseling  debtors may prevent their jeopardiz ing  their  future  ability  to  obtain  credit. As  the National Bankruptcy  Commission, among others, has noted,  debtors often  find  themselves  in a  straight  bankruptcy without  being  aware of the repayment alternative.  Mr. Speaker, our bill also grants a  court the authority, on its own motion  and only on its own motion, to abstain  from or dismiss a chapter 7 proceeding  where to permit it to continue would  constitute an abuse of the Bankruptcy  Code. When this was first brought to  my attention I was shocked to learn  that courts cannot now stop a bank ruptcy  proceeding  even when  the  judge is convinced the relief sought is  unnecessary. This provision is an alter native to the highly criticized thresh old  test or future  income  test con tained in other legislation. Our inten tion  is  to protect consumer debtors  from routine harassment which some  feared could result from the threshold  test, which gave creditors a  formal  procedure by which to challenge chap ter 7 proceedings, while at the same  time helping to curb abuse of chapter  7 relief.  Our bill gives creditors no  formal  procedure. Rather, the court alone de cides. If a creditor does seek to raise  the issue at any point in the proceed ing, the bankruptcy judge is under no  obligation  to hear or consider  the  creditor's motion or petition. It may  be dismissed without comment or con sideration and  the creditor has no  right to appeal. Therefore, the credi tor has no means of bringing any pres sure on the judge to exercise his dis cretion and no means of putting any  pressure on the debtor not to pursue a  chapter 7 straight bankruptcy. Fur ther, creditors who do seek to harass  debtors by filing superfluous motions  or petitions would be subject to all the  ",1983
218,1068,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  in 1968, Congress authorized the con struction of the Dallas Creek project,  Colorado River Basin Project Act,  Public Law 90-537. In November 1976,  the definite plan report for the project  was completed. The repayment con tract was approved in late 1976 at an  election of the residents of the Tri County Water Conservancy District,  the contracting and marketing  local  governmental agency for the project.  In January 1977,  the contract was  signed by the Department of Interior  and the Conservancy District. In Sep tember  1977,  the Commissioner  of  Reclamation authorized  the start of  construction.  Thus,  final designs  and  specifica tions for stage I were not completed  until mid-1979.  Due to dam safety design consider ations prompted by the Teton Dam  failure, the Bureau of Reclamation de cided to proceed with construction in  two phases. Invitations for bids on the  first  phase were  not  issued  until  August 1979. In tum, a contract was  not awarded to the successful bidder  until December  1979,  the Bureau  having obtained an extension of time  from the bidders for the awarding of  the contract. As soon as the contract  was  awarded,  the  contractor  com menced work on the first phase and  has proceeded on schedule  to date.  Construction on  the  first  phase  is  scheduled for completion later in 1981.  At the time the repayment contract  was signed, the estimated costs alloca ble to municipal and industrial water  supply were $27 ,966,000 based on Jan uary 1976 prices and the interest rate  provided for  fiscal year 1976. As of  June 1981, the Bureau of Reclamation  estimates that the costs allocable  to  municipal and industrial water supply  will be approximately $69 million. Ap proximately 60 percent of the increase  from $28 million to $69 million has re sulted from increases in construction  costs caused by design changes, state  of the art considerations, dam safety  considerations, and added instrumen tation, all of which were unanticipated  at the time the repayment contract  was negotiated. The remaining 40 per cent of the cost increase is attributa ble to inflation.  The repayment contract does not ob ligate the Conservancy District to re negotiate, or make any other adjust ments  in  its  contractual  obligation  should the costs allocable to municipal  and industrial water supply exceed $38  million. To the contrary, the $38 mil lion figure is an absolute ceiling.  This provision stands in marked con trast to the terms of all other repay ment contracts, which  typically pro vide  for  ceilings  that must be  in creased to cover the costs allocable to  municipal and industrial water supply  should such costs prove to be in excess  of those contemplated at the time of  the execution of a contract. The lack  of this renegotiation provision in the  repayment contract executed by the  Conservancy District  indicates,  and  ",1983
219,1107,3,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President,  the  emergency  supplemental  appropria tions bill is being described as an anti recession jobs bill by some-but I have  grave doubts as to how many items in  that bill deserve that label. I have ex pressed my concerns  in a memoran dum to Senator HATFIELD, chairman of  the Appropriations Committee,  and  have suggested  to him various steps  that could be taken to insure that the  bill really becomes what it has been la beled. A copy of that memorandum is  attached to my statement.  The Appropriations Committee will  mark up the bill on Monday, March 7  and it will therefore not be ready for  Senate  action until well  into next  week. I believe that the issues raised  by this bill are of major importance  and deserve  reasoned  consideration.  That will not be possible, however,  unless we deal with  the  immediate  emergency that is facing us-the fact  that the States will soon run out of  money to pay unemployment compen sation claims. Additional money must  be made  available  by next Friday,  March 11. I am therefore introducing  with Senator CARL LEVIN an emergen cy  supplemental  appropriation  bill  that will only be sufficient to meet all  the States' needs for unemployment  compensation until the Easter recess.  By enacting that bill immediately, we  can both deal with the unemployment  compensation crisis and give fair conin sideration  to  the complex  issues  volved in the jobs supplemental.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of my memorandum to Senator  HATFIELD and the text of the bill be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  COMMITTEE ON LABOR  AND HUMAN RESOURCES,  Washington, D. C.  To:  Senator MARK  HATFIELD.  Chairman,  Senate Appropriations Committee.  From: DAN QUAYLE.  Date: March 2, 1983.  As you know,  I am concerned that the  Emergency  Supplemental  Appropriation  Act actually be a constructive response to  current high unemployment rates. It seems  to me that any measure which promises to  provide jobs as a countercyclical tool must  be based on four principles:  First, it must provide a reasonable number  of jobs in relationship to the proposed ex penditure;  Second, it must provide those jobs during  the current high unemployment period;  it must concentrate jobs areas of  high unemployment; and  Fourth, it must target those jobs on those  hardest hit by unemployment.  It is, of course, difficult to assure compli ance with these principles in the context of  an appropriations bill. However,  I believe  that the very same conditions which justify  an emergency bill require a non-traditional  approach to that bill.  I therefore recommend that with respect  to any appropriations account  that is  in cluded in the emergency bill because it is de Third,  signed as a jobs response to the current re cession,  the following provisos be added to  the appropriations language:  1. No grant shall be made under the pro gram unless the grantee certifies that funds  will be used so that there will be at least one  person year of direct employment for every  $20,000 of funds received.  2. Funds shall be available for obligation  until September 30, 1983 and for expendi ture for no more than 18 months after date  of obligation.  3. Funds shall be distributed so that at  least 75% of the funds are distributed  to  States (in the case of State grant programs>  or areas <in the case of direct grants to sub state areas> in which the rate of unemploy ment for the last three months of 1982 was  higher than the national average rate of un employment.  4. No grant shall be made under the pro gram unless 75% of the persons hired pursu ant to the grant shall be certified by the  local agency of the USES as unemployed  and as having been unemployed for at least  15 weeks in the preceding six months.  The inclusion of such language would pro vide statutory safeguards  that  the maxi mum number of jobs be created, that they  be created during the period when unem ployment is projected to remain in the 10%  range and that the jobs be targeted both to  high unemployment  areas  and  to  those  hardest hit by unemployment.  I believe it is important that these provi sions be incorporated into the House passed  bill either in the Appropriations Committee  or on the floor. We are promising the Amer ican people a jobs bill and I fear that with out such provisions the bill would fall short  of the promises.

220,1107,3,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, it is my  privilege  to  introduce  today  in  the  Senate a creative and sound approach  to this Nation's unemployment prob lem, one which was developed and in troduced in the House of Representa tives by my distinguished Illinois col league, Congresswoman LYNN MARTIN.  This  legislation-H.R.  116  in  the  House-authorizes a new type of reve nue-sharing program to be used by the  States, with Governors  as  the key  leaders in developing employment pro grams for the unemployed.  Our legislation provides for a 2-year  program of grants to the States, with  a yearly authorization of $3 billion.  The funds would be allocated among  the States  according  to  a  formula  based  one-third  on  population  and  two-thirds on wage and salary growth  compared to the national average. All  of the money will be under the juris diction of the Governor of each State.  He or she will be directed to spend 50  percent of  the money on qualifying  employment projects in those counties  of the State which have above average  unemployment and below average per  capita income, according to a formula  spelled out in the bill. The other 50  percent can be spent in the rest of the  State.  In all cases of funding, it is the Gov ernor who determines what jobs pro grams will be undertaken. He must  consult with the State job training co ordinating council as established last  year by the Job Training Partnership  Act. The council is composed of busi ness and labor representatives and of  State and local officials. He must de termine that the projects funded will  contribute most to the creation of jobs  for the unemployed in the State and,  further, he is required to present an  explanation of how these expenditures  can be expected to increase jobs and  why one particular use of funds  to  create jobs was chosen over another.  ",1983
221,1120,3,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing the Natural Gas Policy  Act Amendments of 1983.  Its enact ment would provide  immediate price  relief  to all natural gas consumers,  providing an average annual savings  for each  residential consumer of at  least $200, a nationwide total annual  savings of $25 billion.  In no way is it an oversimplification  to  state  that many Pennsylvanians  and people across our Nation will be  faced with the choice of heating or  eating this year.  The citizens of my home State and  many others know only too well that  gas prices have outstripped both their  income earning capabilities and that  these crippling price increases have af fected other goods and services.  Consider  that  between  1978  and  1981,  the  income of a Pennsylvania  manufacturing employee increased by  30 percent while his natural gas bill in crease by 127 percent.  Consider that between September of  1978 and September of 1982, the gas  rates charged by the six pipelines serv ing Pennsylvania increased by an aver age of 175.6 percent while  the Con sumer Price Index was growing by 47.2  percent.  Consider  that  between  1978  and  1982, gas prices charged to residential  consumers in the city of Philadelphia  increased by in excess of 94 percent  and  in the city of Pittsburgh by  in  excess of 86 percent.  I said earlier, many Pennsylva nians will be faced with the choice of  heating or eating this year.  Over 350,000 Pennsylvania families  fall below 125 percent of the poverty  level,  the  financial dividing  line  for  most  Federal  assistance  programs.  That line is $5,016 per year, or $418  per month in disposable income. After  spending money for rent, the gas bill,  the nonheating electric utility bill, and  food,  the  average  family  of  three  below the poverty level will find itself  $33 in debt.  Just as bad  is  that plight of  the  single  elderly Pennsylvanian  totally  dependent on a maximum supplemen tary  security  income  payment  of  $317 .60 per month. After paying his or  her natural gas bill, this elderly PennAs  ",1983
222,1133,3,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, for the  past 2 years, this administration has  tried to achieve economic growth with  only one tool: fiscal policy. This led to  almost no growth or anemic growth at  best.  At the same time, the Federal Re serve Board has conducted a very con servative monetary policy  that has  made growth nearly impossible. As a  result, at a time when we most need to  expand  the  economic pie,  it keeps  shrinking.  The  resolution Senator MOYNIHAN  and I are introducing calls on the Fed eral Reserve Board to manage mone tary policy so as to achieve the aver age real growth rate of previous post war recoveries. It is based on the expe rience of  those  recoveries  that eco nomic growth requires an accommoda tive monetary policy. It makes high  economic growth, once again, the pri mary economic priority of the United  States.  The  danger  of  failing  to move  toward an accommodative monetary  policy at this time is clear: the recov ery which most economists believe is  now beginning could quickly founder  and we could sink into a third reces sion in as many years.  It is  time for a strong, affirmative  statement that all our economic poli cies-monetary and fiscal-will be di rected toward high economic growth.  This is essential for the health of our  changing economy and for the health  of the world economy. A move by our  Government toward a more accommo dative monetary policy would alleviate  the growing debt problem of develop ing countries and would give a needed  boost to the economies of our allies.  The benefits from hlgher growth are  striking:  The Moynihan-Hart proposal would  give u.s a GNP of $577 billion by 1988,  11.6 percent higher than the current  administration projections.  Putting monetary policy back on a  growth path would put 1,400,000 more  people back to work by 1988 than the  administration plan.  Personal income and corporate prof its would also be higher.  There would be substantial recovery  in housing and autos.    Growth  also makes  a  substantial  contribution to  reducing  the size of  the deficit in future years if we also  need to take a number of other initia tives to contain spending and increase  revenues to keep the deficit under con trol. For instance, the combination of  higher growth under Moynihan-Hart  and a delay in the implementation of  indexing brings the 1988 deficit down  to $15 billion.  The program does contain one cost:  Under Moynihan-Hart plan, the Con sumer Price Index would rise from 6.1  percent in 1982 to 6.8 percent in 1988.  This assumption is based on oil price  estimates that came before the recent  tumble  in world oil prices-the 1988  results would look better if they were  based on today's estimates.  However, we still need to develop a  program to control inflation. The past  2 years are a stark reminder of the  costs of fighting inflation with a deep  recession. The country has lost hun dreds of billions of dollars, millions of  people have been thrown out of work,  and  investments  in our future have  been delayed, cut back or cancelled.  The controls of  the Nixon years  proved to be costly in a quite different  way and are an unacceptable solution.  What we need  is a  policy or more  likely a combination of policies that  will continue to wind down inflation  and prepare us for any future price  shocks.

227,1146,3,Mr.  GLENN.," Mr. President, with  much enthusiasm, I congratulate two  fellow Ohioans, Doris A. Dennison and  Walter J. Kramer, who have devoted  much of their lives to improving the  legal system in my State. At a  time  when the value of devoted public serv ice is too often ignored, it is refreshing  to report that the Portage County Bar  Association will acknowledge its appre ciation on March 23, 1983, by present ing these two fine people with certifi cates of merit for outstanding service.  Mrs. Dennison and Mr. Kramer have  demonstrated unfailing patience and  courtesy, devotion to duty and atten tive service to both the public and to  members of the Bench and Bar Asso ciation in Portage County.  Mrs. Dennison, presently the assign ment commissioner  for  the Portage  County Common Pleas Court, was se lected for  the position  in 1972. She  previously worked for 5 years as the  Jury Commissioner and  receptionist  for the Court of Common Pleas and as  2 years as secretary to the 11th Dis trict Member of Congress from Ohio.  Mrs. Dennison has also been active in  local charity work, educational activi ties, Little League Baseball, and politi cal campaigns. She and her husband,  Robert, have three childre and are the  proud grandparents of a grandson.  Mr. Kramer, currently administrator  for  the  Portage  County  Juvenile  Court, was chosen for his position in  1967 by the late Honorable Sam Sum mers. Mr. Kramer first joined the ju venile court as a probation officer in  1951 and then became chief probation  officer in 1960. Prior to his work in ju venile court, Mr. Kramer served as a  Kent City patrolman for 5 years and  as a member of the U.S. Air Force for  4 years. He has long been active in the  Fraternal Order of Police,  the Kent  Masonic  Lodge,  the  Northeastern  Ohio Youth Commission and the Ohio  Court and Correctional Association.  His community work has included area  youth sports organizations,  the Cub  Scouts, the Kiwanis Club and others.  He and Muriel, his wife of 44 years,  reside in Kent, Ohio.  Again, I congratulate Mrs. Dennison  and Mr. Kramer for  their  long and  faithful service to the public interest.  Their contributions have done much  to improve the quality of life in Por tage County.e  <At the request of Mr. BYRD the fol lowing statement was ordered  to be  printed in the RECORD:)  HIGH TECHNOLOGY IN  AMERICA  ",1983
228,1146,3,Mr.  HART.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join Senator TsoNGAS and  Senator STENNIS  in  introducing  the  High Technology Morrill Act. My  hope is that this bill will do for high  technology what the original Morrill  Act of 1862 did for American agricul ture-namely, make it the most highly  productive and most globally competi tive industry in the world.  America's  economic  strength  has  been built on being out front on the  leading sectors of the time. We must  act swiftly and boldly to insure that  America retains its current position as  the world's technological and service  leader.  Like  the original Morrill Act,  this  bill fuses the interests of industry, the  education  community  and Govern ment <both State and Federal> into a  forward-looking  national  initiative this  time devoted  to sharpening the  competitive edge of America's knowl edge-based industries which are facing  a serious global challenge.  Specifically,  the  bill  encourages  partnerships  nationwide  between  State government and industry to pro vide matching grants for higher educa tion. The funds would be used primari ly to upgrade curricula in science, en gineering,  and  technology-related  fields. The role of the Federal Govern ment is  limited to providing national  direction and shared funding of the  program.  In short,  this  is a bottom up ap proach-specific projects would be ini tiated by local industry in cooperation  with education and State economic de velopment agencies. Such joint project  initiation by a corporation and campus  appears to me the wisest and most ef fective way to proceed-it insures that  programs respond to legitimate tech nological needs, it makes wise use of  educational resources, and it satisfies  economic development priorities.  Mr. President, this is truly a bill for  America's future that is firmly ground  in today's realities and challenges. The  decentralized thrust of the bill and its  incentives  for partnership  initiatives  by industry, education and State gov ernments should make it appealing to  Members on both sides of the aisle.  My hope is that we in this body can  put into place this year a  legislative  platform as creative and farsighted as  Senator Morrill's platform over a cen tury ago.e  ORDER OF PROCEDURE  ",1983

243,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may re quire.  Mr. Chairman, may I say that the  job we have here today-and it is a job  in itself-is one that I did not volun teer for, but I was more or less drafted  to do. However, being drafted as I was,  I felt it is an area where we need, as I  see it, to work together for the good of  the country.  There is no question that unemploy ment  is  rampant over  the country.  There is no question that many, many  people are in bankruptcy, and the situ ation is growing worse. I read in the  papers  that  the  stock market has  picked up, but we know that the stock  market has picked up  in  times past  when the bottom was falling out. Now  is the time that we do something for  the  unemployed  people  of  our  country.  May I  trace briefly with the Mem bers the legislative situation that we  have here. Last year I was asked to  deal with a bill that was ref erred to  our Committee on Appropriations that  amounted to jobs relief to be distribut ed over the United States. It was my  advice that there was no way that the  Congress should pass such a bill as it  was proposed. After conferring with  my friends who had introduced it, the  authors,  the gentleman  from Ken tucky <Mr. PERKINS),  the gentleman  from Texas <Mr. WRIGHT), the gentle man from Minnesota <Mr. OBERSTAR),  and  the gentleman  from California  <Mr. HAWKINS), we rewrote it into a jobs  bill in the Committee on Appropria tions.  May I say that when the pressure  was on us to come up with a jobs bill, I  did not know any better way  to ap proach it than the way we did.  Then during December  in connec tion with  the continuing  resolution,  we developed a  jobs bill which  the  House passed, and which  the Presi dent had said  in the newspapers he  was going to veto. Later in conference,  it was withdrawn with the approval of  the leadership of the House. This year  I called the subcommittee chairman of  the Appropriations Committee togeth er and asked them to bring to us those  projects  in  their  respective  jurisdic tions which take care of our country's  needs and create jobs. Many of these  programs have been justified but not  funded. I do not know how we could go  about getting a better base on which  to start, because  the Appropriations  Committee and its 13 subcommittees  each year holds hundreds of days of  hearings before the committees. That  is an annual procedure.  In the  last  Congress, the 97th Congress, we had  over 11,000 witnesses, Americans, that  come before us and testify in behalf of  various projects.  So there is no better starting point,  in my opinion, than to ask the sub committee's who are familiar with it  and  the  subcommittee chairmen  to  bring  forward  the needed projects,  again those which had been justified  but had not been funded, as a starting  point toward putting people back  to  work.  Please remember, last year's bill was  passed by the House, and .it went to  the Senate. We were  in process of  working out a compromise with our  counterpart on the other side, and the  President  announced  that  he was  going to veto it if we  tried to move  with a jobs title. At ,that point I came  to our leadership and said, ""The Presi dent has said in advance  that he  is  going to veto it, and we might just as  well withdraw it."" So we went ahead  and did withdraw it.  ",1983
244,1172,3,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
245,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," I will yield in just a  moment. On January 6 of this year I  reintroduced virtually  the same  jobs  bill, figuring that when we came back  here, we doubtless would take up that  jobs bill again.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentle man from Michigan.  ",1983
246,1172,3,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the  committee  chairman  for  yielding.  May I ask, why is this not c.alled a  supplemental  appropriations  bill  rather than a jobs bill?  ",1983
247,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," Well  there are so  many different programs in there that  I believe are needed to describe the ef forts being made here because  they  said they hated just to have jobs cre ated.  May I briefly describe the situation?  In the other jobs bill, it was sold to  the country as creating jobs. The dif ference between this bill and that bill  is that we get something of real value  for our dollars  in  this bill. We are  doing some work to improve and pro tect our country. The person gets a job  working for the country, and the coun try ends up in better shape and richer.  So this creates a  job, it creates work  which improves our country and adds  to our basic wealth. That is the differ ence here.  One of my friends said to me that we  have a bill that intends to create jobs.  We have got plenty of jobs to do if we  look around our country, and that is  what this bill does. The jq_bs have been  provided, but it has not been played  up in just that way, the emphasis is  different.  ",1983
248,1172,3,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield further?  ",1983
249,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.,  I will be glad  to  yield to the gentleman from Michigan.  ,1983
250,1172,3,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the  committee  chairman  for  that information.  My inclination is not to support this  legislation because it insults the obvious fact that there are somewhere be tween 16 million and 20 million people  out of work, and calling this a jobs bill  in March 1983 is to mislead millions of  people out of work and millions more  that are probably going to end up out  of work.  ",1983
251,1172,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Chairman,  if  the gentleman will allow me to pro ceed, I will touch on that.  Let me say that with the constraints  in which I was put in this case, instead  of calling up my bill which I had intro duced on January 6, there was a meet ing between  the  leadership and  the  President's representative, in which an  agreement was reached, according to  the press, of around $4.3  billion  in  relief. The intention, as I understand  it was  to get a  bill  that could be  signed. This was not my decision.  I  would not say I was dissatisfied with  it, but it was not my decision.  Then  I was more or  less drafted  again  into bringing out a bill  that  would  stay within  the  reasonable  limit, so that would be signed. So we  had  those wraps around us  to start  with.  So with that understanding, let me  go  into how we proceeded. Again let  me say that I have not heard any com plaint here up  to now  that we are  paying out $32 billion a year on unem ployment compensation, and  in  this  bill we are providing an additional $5  billion to pay unemployment compen satiop..  Keep in mind that however neces sary that is to the individual who gets  it, it does JlOt contribute one activity  to the wealth of this country. May I  say to my colleagues that if we had  passed the bill which we had last year,  which was in effect vetoed in advance,  I  think the $5 billion in this bill for  unemployment compensation would be  down to about $3 billion. We need to  get the economy moving, and the best  place to do it is to get value received,  plus the jobs and plus the economic  activity. Again I say that I was under  an overall constraint, and  I daresay  that most members on the Appropria tions Committee were not satisfied to  have those wraps put around us. But if  we are going to get a bill signed, we  were told that was necessary.  0 1215  So may I say again that in the Ap propriation Committee we went to the  subcommittees who know  the most  about these problems, this was during  the February recess.  I have cleared  this with  the subcommittee, we  ar ranged  it by  jurisdiction, by  those  folks who understand the problems in  their own areas.  Now,  in  this bill  there are many  things that are a must in my opinion.  If we are going to get value received and maintain and  improve  the  real  wealth of our country rather than our    ",1983

253,1185,3,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Chairman and  Members of the House, I rise in sup port of this bill, and let me say, Mr.  Chairman,  I  think we all hope and  pray for a speedy economic recovery  for the people of this country.  Let me add: When the United States  is at  the  lowest economic point  in  nearly 50 years, when you are near the  bottom, there is only one way to go,  and that is up. That is up and hopeful ly that is where we are headed.  Mr. Chairman,  I want  to  take  a  moment  to  address  something  the  ranking minority Member mentioned  in his debate concerning the McGee  Creek project in Oklahoma. He men tioned Oklahoma has 6. 7 percent un employment, and that is probably true  for the entire State of Oklahoma. The  ranking minority Membe.r from Massa chusetts is a friend of mine. And hope fully, there might be some money for  that project if the Bureau of Reclama tion sees fit. In Atoka County where  that project is,  there is 13.4 percent  unemployment. There is 17 .3 percent  unemployment  in  the  neighboring  Pushmataha County. There  is  16.4  percent in the coal county just north  of Atoka County and there is 15.4 per cent in Choctaw County to the south.  That is an economic rural depressed  area of chronically unemployed and  underemployed  in  this Nation,  that  has not been addressed by this Con gress or by this administration. The  people in rural America are the under dogs of the underdogs. They are the  forgotten people.  I  regret very much when  I  find  people  coming up  and  attacking  a  project or an area who do not have the  facts concerning the economic situa tion. Sixty-eight percent of the people  have left many of these counties  in  the 50 years in the search for a  job.  They have left trying to find a der.ent  fulltime job. Our children still ou\mi grate and the Grapes of Wrath of our  educated young people is continuing.  I ask the people to take these facts  into consideration when they vote on  this jobs bill. I have asked the leader ship of the House and I have asked  the administration not to just look at  State statistics, but ask, ""What about  economically deprived, depressed rural  areas of  this  country?"" They have  been ignored in the past, but hopeful ly this bill will meet a  few of those  needs.  I ask you to support this bill.  D 1330  The CHAIRMAN.

259,1198,3,Mr. HEFTEL of Hawaii.," Mr. Chair man, I  rise  in support of H.R. 1718,  the first step in this Congress resumed  battle against the recession and its re sulting unemployment and poverty.  Mr. Chairman,  this measure does  not please any of us completely, yet it  is a program which I believe permits  us to get the beginnings of aid quickly  to many of those who need it desper ately.  Hawaii's jobless banks are filled with  those who have remained without em ployment for extremely lengthy peri ods. Seventy percent of  the unem ployed have remained so for 5 weeks  or longer; a full 30 percent have been  jobless 14 weeks or more. Those who  are suffering as a result of Honolulu's  ailing construction  industry will cer tainly benefit  from  the  infusion of  community development block grant  ( CDBG) and other construction funds  provided by this legislation.  I  am,  however,  deeply  concerned  that the measure before us will not  adequately aid the rest of our long term unemployed. A more direct and  substantial means of providing  jobs  must be produced to assist these struc turally unemployed in Hawaii and the  rest of the Nation.  Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I urge  my colleagues  to swiftly adopt H.R.  1718, but just as swiftly develop fur ther legislation with far greater job creation value.e  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 1718 providing $4.6  billion in emergency expenditures to  create new jobs and to urge its approv al by the House.  Mr. Chairman, the committee report  cites a 13.6 unemployment rate in my  home State of Pennsylvania. In some  sections of my congressional district it  is nearly double that figure. And for  those of us who have wished prosperi ty and those of us who have supported  policies we thought would speed that  prosperity these are cold and grim and  disappointing statistics. For in them selves  they contain  those who have  given up the hope for work and those  who are now saying ""I'll do anything  for a job."" They do not speak to those  just entering the job market fearing  their skills will have no place to be put  to the test.  We agreed to meet those needs and I  believe today this bill takes a positive  step  in that direction.  I know  there  will be members and critics who will  deride this bill as another make-work  bill. In these days of high unemploy ment the term make-work carries less  of a stigma than in times of prosperi ty. We have to make work and we have  to make more work  than  is  even  dreamed of in this bill if our Nation is  to prosper.  Before the Members of this House  raise the roof over the issue of make work jobs, let me ask you to take a  look at the $5 billion you are about to  appropriate  to keep  the unemploy ment compensation fund so.lvent and  keep benefits  flowing  to  the unem ployed. Ask yourselves whether or not  we should put those people to work or  whether we ought to meet here again  in 6 months and vote for another mul tibillion-dollar replenishment.  My friends, I call your attention to  the segments of the bill relating to the  Interior and related agencies appro priations. We provided funds for ac tivities with  a  quick  payout. We  funded programs that were already in  place and ready to go. and we funded  programs where we knew that there  were a meaningful number of jobs cre ated for the money spent.  We added funds for the successful  weatherization program. This program  not only helps save energy  it puts  roughly 50 people to work full time in  a construction program for every mil lion dollars we spend. We added $50  million for cyclic maintenance to the  National Park Service, relying heavily  on the administration's priority needs  and committing money now for  this  work in time for the spring construc tion  season. Likewise we  added an other $45 million for maintenance and  construction needs  of  the national  forest system, another $40 million for  badly needed Indian health construc tion and $25 million for cyclic mainte nance at the Nation's fish and wildlife  refuges and hatcheries.  This bill  also  contains  significant  outlays of money for our existing com munity development block grant pro gram, urban action grant program and  to the programs of the Economic De velopment Administration. Mr. Chair man, I can think of no quicker way to  get jobs, especially construction jobs,  underway  on  vital  public  improve ments than to expand the community  development program. To those who  believe as I do that the Federal dollar  is a carrot on the stick that builds pri vate investments into public expendi tures let me suggest that the urban  action grant program and the econom ic development grant program lever age private dollars from a tight econo my that otherwise might not be invest ed. These programs have proven track  records of generating as much as five  and six private dollars for every one  Federal dollar invested in the creation  of new jobs.  Mr. Chairman, the most optimistic  among us must concede that at most  we may be creating 300,000 jobs. The  most pessimistic among us may say  that is not enough. Both are  right.  But I will vote for this bill rather than  sit idly by and wait for our appropria tions committee  to come forth with  the next installment in the replenish ment of the unemployment compensa tion fund.  This bill is not perfect. It contains  no new ideas on job creation. It relies  mostly on existing programs.  It re quires  few  if any new structures.  I  intend to support it and I am hopeful  that  the  investment we make here  today will create new jobs tomorrow.   e ",1983
260,1198,3,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Chairman, last Wednesday, the direc tor of the Employment Security Divi sion in Arkansas notified me that as of  this Friday, March 4, due to insuffi cient funds  they would be forced  to  resort to mailing IOU's to over 70,000  unemployed  citizens.  Fortunately;  however,  information was  received  today  advising  that  $8,030,461  has  been allocated, to Arkansas in addition  to the $6,524,000 which was provided  earlier. This total of $14,554,461 will  now be  sufficient  to provide  funds  through March 15.  I know my col leagues will agree that it is preposter ous  to  think  that  unemployment  checks would not have been issued had  this not occurred.

That is what is going to happen.  They will  just delay it and delay  it,  and we are giving the agencies a blank  check  to delay  this as  long as  they  want to.

263,1224,3,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, in the sections of this bill dealing  with funds for health and social serv ices,  the committee  report makes  it  clear that those funds shall be target ed based on unemployment and  the  greatest  demand  for  services. This  amendment  assures  that  the provi sions of the bill aimed at job creation  shall be focused on the areas where  there is the greatest need for job cre ation. The ref ore,  the amendment  is  both necessary  and  consistent with  other portions of the bill.  This Nation has  reached  a  point  where CARE packages are being sent  to the unemployed in Michigan from  West Germany  and  the mayor  of  Cleveland states that his city is run ning out of ways to feed its hungry. It  is time for action.  This  is  the  sentiment  that  has  strongly prevailed among new Demo cratic Members  as we  have  spent  hours working on the jobs issue. Influ enced  by  this work,  Congressman  BRUCE MORRISON and I presented  to  the  Rules  Committee  a  targeting  amendment, a proposal now incorpo rated in this amendment; 12 days ago  when  I was  talking  to unemployed  women and men in a suburban Detroit  unemployment  compensation  office,  an unemployed worker  said  to me:  ""The toughest job in Michigan today  is finding a job.""  This amendment is critical if we are  to respond to that poignant commen tary on  the state of  the Nation  in  March 1983.  Mr. MORRISON  Mr. Chairman, will  yield?  ",1983

265,1224,3,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, this targeting amend ment  is one of  the most  important  goals we should have  in considering  this bill. This is a  jobs bill. This is a  bill that is intended to bring relief to  millions of unemployed people in this  country, and if we are to bring that  relief, we should to the greatest extent  possible  target it in accordance with  the need.  Now, there is some concern that had  been expressed about individuals who  have been out of the work force for so  long that they are not counted among  the unemployed. There are many such  individuals in my community, in one  of the towns I represent, New Haven,  Conn. In fact, New Haven, Conn., has  the seventh largest rate of poverty in  the United States, and,  in fact, New  Haven, Conn., has a relatively low un employment rate. It is true that when  individuals have been so long out of  the work force, they stop being count ed as unemployed.  But something else happens. They  are counted as poor. They enter the  statistic about the poverty rate, and  one critical element of  this amend ment is that it takes that fact into ac count. The poverty rate, as well as the  unemployment rate,  is being used to  target these funds. That is being done  by  using  the  urban  development  action grant program which targets on  communities in distress.  We have achieved  in  this amend ment a way of  targeting that group  that the distinguished gentleman from  Iowa <Mr. SMITH) has referred to, the  unemployed poor who have been out  of work for so long that they are no  longer  counted  as  unemployed. We  have done  that for all  jurisdictions,  towns, townships, cities, and counties,  and we have also done it for pockets of  poverty within jurisdictions where the  poverty rate or unemployment itself is  not high.  Targeting is a key to this bill, and  the addition of this amendment will  give us  the  targeting  that we need,  both in those communities of high un employment and in those communities  of high rates of poverty.

268,1224,3,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Emergency Supple mental Appropriations Act of 1983 be cause the unemployment situation in  the United States is intolerable. Aid to  the  jobless and humanitarian  relief  are essential elements of this measure.  I view  this bill as our first, positive  step in translating the message of last  November's  congressonal  elections  into legislation for our people.  However, I believe that the impact  of this bill would be greater if it would  target its benefits to those areas of the  country suffering  from  the greatest  unemployment. I  thus strongly stand  in  favor  of  the Edgar  amendment  which establishes  in our first major  piece of jobs-related legislation in this  Congress  the  important principle of  targetting funds on the basis of unem ployment and poverty rates.  Although  the  rates of unemploy ment and the extent of dislocation are  severe throughout the Nation, many  areas  like my own  in  the Greater  Toledo area have been especially hard  hit. Our Nation's industrial areas are  in a depression, facing unemployment  rates far in excess of the national av erage. In Ohio, for example, the Janu ary  rate of unemployment was 14.9  percent, almost 50 percent more than  the rate for the Nation. Well over one half million Ohioans are out of work  and in my own area over 50,000 are  jobless. All of you are well aware of  the pain that accompanies the erosion  not only of a manufacturing base, but  of human dignity. Thus, members of  the Ohio delegation were  active  in  trying  to get  targetting  language  in  this bill and I strongly support this  amendment.  The prospects for either shortor  long-term  economic  recovery  are  dismal for the hard-hit regions of this  country. Though the national unem ployment rate dropped from 10.8 per cent to 10.4 percent from December to  January,  the unemployment  rate  in  Ohio rose  from 14.1 percent  to 14.9  percent. The average duration of un employment is also growing with over  one-third of the unemployed being out  of work for over 17 weeks. In my dis trict, unemployment has risen again  recently, now to a level of 14.3 percent.  The Toledo area has lost 10,800 manu facturing jobs in the last 2 years and  25,000 jobs in the last 10 years.  The working people of  these de pressed regions must be rescued and  the most effective way to do that is to  channel benefits directly to their area.  Unless benefits are targetted to areas  with the highest levels of unemploy ment-from Laredo, Tex., Pittsburgh,  Youngstown,  Milwaukee,  Seattle,  Yuba City, Calif., to Buffalo, N.Y., and  Birmingham, Ala., and yes, Toledo this Congress will  have  failed  the  American people. To do so, would be  unconscionable.  I urge your support  for the Edgar amendment.  ",1983

278,1302,3,Mr.  FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker. every  war produces those who stand out as  individuals  who  expressed  their  unique abilities  through acts of un common courage and valor. The most  supreme acts of heroism are  recog nized with the Medal of Honor.  This recognition by the President in  the name of the Congress may only be  accorded an  individual who  ""distin guished himself conspicuously by gal lantry and intrepidity at the risk of  his life above and beyond the call of  duty"".  New Jerseyite John Basilone distin guished himself not once. but many  times, on the field of battle as Ameri can forces engaged the enemy in the  Pacific some 40 years ago. Basilone's  herosim at Guadalcanal was awarded  by the presentation of first Congres sional Medal of Honor to be received  by an enlisted Marine in World War  II. Forsaking stateside duty, Sergeant  Basilone was  reassigned  to  combat  duty at his own request; 38 years ago  this month, Basilone died in service to  his country. Basilone was posthumous ly awarded the Navy Cross, the Navy's  second highest military decoration, for  gallantry displayed as he led his unit  through Iwo Jima enemy lines.  It is sad that more people do not re member John Basilone and his uncom mon contributions. I support the ef forts of Mayor Steve Del Rocco and  the people of Raritan, N.J., Basilone's  hometown, to gain greater recognition  for  this  special American. Donato  Sodano of the New Jersey Army and  Navy Union has also been tireless in  supporting efforts to honor Basilone.  Perhaps the greatest honor we may  bestow upon John Basilone, and the  over 1 million other Americans to have  died in war, is to remember those who  still suffer as a result of having sur vived war.  Our great task now as a nation is to  insure that those who served, and suf fered  in defense of our liberties, are  not denied the respect, benefits, and  rights they have earned. I urge my col leagues to join me in this task.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  John Basilone's story for the benefit  of my colleagues.  March 3, 1983  [From the Sunday Star-Ledger, Feb. 13,  1983]  GREATER RECOGNITION SOUGHT FOR JERSEY  WAR HERO  FRIENDS PUSHING STATE TO HONOR MEMORY OF  MARINE AT IWO JIMA  <By James Benson)  New J erseyan John A. Basilone will for ever be remembered in United States mili tary annals, but today few residents in his  home state know about the heroic Marine  who was killed at Iwo Jima.  The Raritan resident was the first enlisted  Marine in World War II to win the Congres sional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest  military decoration, for heroism at Guadal canal.  Given a stateside tour of duty promoting  the sale of war bonds after Guadalcanal, Ba silone requested a return to combat.  He was killed by a mortar blast during the  invasion of Iwo Jima 38 years go this Satur day, on Feb. 19, 1945, after an amazing dis play of courage on the battlefield for which  he was posthumously awarded  the Navy  Cross.  He is buried in Arlington National Ceme tery, Arlington, Va.  Some people say he should have received  a second Medal of Honor for his heroism on  Iwo Jima.  Many contend that despite a number of  monuments to Basilone erected around the  state, he has never been appropriately me morialized in New Jersey.  Now  a  longtime  admirer  of Basilone.  Donato Sodano of Maplewood,  is  calling  again for ""proper recognition"" of the ser geant and his deeds.  Sodano took part in memorial ceremonies  for Basilone on the anniversary of his death  almost every year until 1973. Since  then,  health problems have  forced him  to stay  home.  ""I don't think the state of New Jersey has  done  enough  to  honor  this outstanding  man,"" remarked Sodano, 75, a retired insur ance agent who served in the Army during  World War II.  As an official of the New Jersey chapter  of a veterans' organization, the Army and  Navy Union, Sodano spearheaded a drive in  1950 to have the New Jersey Turnpike, then  under construction, named for Basilone.  The Turnpike authority turned down So dano's group and other veterans' organiza tions supporting the proposal.  Pike officials said legislation authorizing  construction of the superhighway required  that it be named as it was, the New Jersey  Turnpike.  As a gesture to the vets' groups, the turn pike officials agreed to name the turnpike  bridge over the Raritan River in New Bruns wick for Basilone.  Sodano and his group were not invited to  the dedication of the bridge, he said.  ""I intend to confer with our Department  of New Jersey Army and Navy Union offi cials to start a statewide campaign in con junction with other veteran groups to have  the state of New Jersey take some action to  accord proper recognition to one of its most  illustrious sons and one of our country's  outstanding heroes,"" Sodano said.  October 1942, the month when John Basi lone won the Medal of Honor, was a grim  and desperate time for Americans struggling  to hold the strategic airbase called Hender son Field on the island of Guadalc;mal.  The outcome of the first American Pacific  offensive of World War II was uncertain as  ",1983
279,25,7,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, recent ly,  the Postal Service announced  it  would be issuing on October 1 a block  of four stamps honoring the 150th an niversary of the streetcar in America.  One of these stamps will feature the  Bobtail, the last horse-drawn streetcar  in America, located in Sulphur Rock,  Ark. The Bobtail was  in operation  from 1889  to 1926 when  it was  re placed by the automobile.  Sulphur Rock's post office was es tablished in 1834. When the streetcar  line opened, it connected the town's  business  section with  the  railrmid  depot, 1 mile away.  The honor of this postage stamp is a  great tribute to the people and history  of Sulphur Rock and  Independence  County and also the pioneering efforts  of the line's owner and operator, John  C. Huddleston.  It is also well-deserved recognition of  the enterprising spirit of smalltown  Arkansas and smalltown America.  I  commend the Postal Service on this  selection.

284,25,7,Mr. JACKSON.," I  thank my friend  from South Carolina.  Mr. President, like my colleagues, I  have been following the discussion of  Ambassador Kenneth Adelman's nom ination  to be Director of  Control Agency. What strikes me  is  what struck the editorial writer in the  Washington Post-the controversy has  the Arms  focused not on  the nominee's views  and competence but on largely ephem eral side issues.  To my satisfaction the record con firms  that  Ambassador  Adelman  played it straight with the Senate in  testifying that he did not intend to  deal with particular personnel matters  at ACDA before he was confirmed,  and  that he planned no  ideological  purge.  What is Ambassador Adelman's view  of national security and arms control?  I  find  it basically  sensible,  as  evi denced in his writings over the years  and in his management of arms con trol affairs for the U.S. delegation as  Ambassador at the United Nations.  Briefly, he believes in an adequately  strong national  defense. He  favors  mutual arms  reductions which pro mote security. He believes the United  States should not agree  to  treaties  unless the terms enhance security. He  recognizes that sound, verifiable arms  control  agreements  are  difficult  to  achieve in the face of ever-advancing  military technology and Soviet disin formation  and  intransigence.  He  favors vigorous efforts to get on with  the task and make the most of oppor tunities  to achieve  real arms reduc tions.  I  am  sympathetic with President  Reagan's desire to have as Director of  the Arms Control Agency an official  whom he believes fit for the post and  in whom he has confidence.  I have  long maintained  that  a  President  should be entitled to his choice of the  top  officials  in  administration,  unless there was convincing evidence  of hopeless naivete,  incompetence or  malfeasance. I find no such evidence  in the case of Kenneth Adelman.  President Reagan has expressed un wavering support for his nominee. Sec retary of State Shultz is giving him  staunch backing. I see no reason not  to vote in his favor.  I yield the floor.  ",1983
285,25,7,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from South Carolina.  ,1983
286,25,7,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise today in support of the nomina tion of Kenneth Adelman to be the Di rector of the Arms Control and Disar mament Agency, known as ACDA.  Ambassador Adelman has an exten sive background in foreign and defense  policy, including arms control and dis armament issues. For the past 2 years,  he has served as U.S. Representative  to the United Nations. While serving  in that position, Ambassador Adelman  has participated  in several National  Security Council decisions sessions on  arms control. From 1976 to 1977, Mr.  Adelman served as Assistant  to  the  Secretary of Defense. He has  also  served at the Agency for International  Development and in the Department  of Commerce.  There is no doubt that Ambassador  Adelman has  the qualifications and  his  experience to fill the position of Direc tor of the Arms Control and Disarma ment Agency. The real question we are  addressing today is the prerogative of  the President to select individuals who  share his ideals and approaches to for eign affairs if he is to conduct a sound  and coherent arms control policy.  President Reagan is entitled to have  as his Director of the Arms Control  Agency someone who reflects his views  and shares his serious commitment to  world peace. This  is essential, since  the United States  faces  a  critical  period in its relations with the Soviet  Union. If we are to be successful in ne gotiating balanced, equitable, and veri fiable arms control agreements,  the  Director of ACDA must approach the  negotiations with  realism,  common sense,  courage,  and  toughness  tem pered with wise  flexibility. Without  these qualities, we cannot hope to be  successful  in achieving arms control  agreements that will  lead to a more  secure, peaceful world which we all  seek.  Mr.  President, Kenneth Adelman  possesses these essential qualities. He  is the President's choice for this im portant post, and it is imperative that  the President have a close working re lationship with the Director of  this  crucial agency. I am confident that he  will serve the country well, and I hope  that my colleagues will go on record in  favor of his nomination.  ",1983
287,25,7,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I wish to  thank both my colleagues, the Presi dent pro tempore of the Senate and  Senator JACKSON, for their incisive and  helpful comments.  I think they have thought through  this nomination in a bipartisan fash ion and  the conclusions  they have  reached are absolutely sound.  Voting down the Adelman nomina tion would be a setback for arms con trol. It would undercut the commit ments that we now have from the ad ministration as to the kind of progress  on arms control  they will work for  with the advice and counsel of Ambas sador Adelman.  I  thank both of my distinguished  colleagues very much indeed.  ",1983
288,25,7,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  wish to thank the able Senator from  Illinois for his kind remarks and also  commend him  for  the outstanding  leadership he has provided on  this  nomination which is so vital to this  Nation.  There  is nothing more  important  than proper arms control. Mr. Adel man is qualified. There should be no  question about the Senate confirming  him. The President wants him. He is  qualified to fill the job. So why should  he not be confirmed?  ",1983
289,25,7,Mr.  JACKSON.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Senator from Illinois,  the  chairman of  the committee,  for his  kind comments.  ",1983
290,38,7,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I commend  the Senator from South Dakota on his  statement. As chairman of the Arms  Control Subcommittee, he has had a  particular opportunity  to study  this  matter. I think his suggestion is a fine  one. I think if either President Ford or  Secretary Kissinger would take on an  assignment of this sort, it would be a  wonderful  thing  for  the country.  I  think they would do a good  job. It  would raise the profile of arms control  and it would be an indication that this  administration takes the whole ques tion of arms control seriously, which  some of us question, I amongst them.  I yield the floor.  ",1983
291,38,7,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I am de lighted to yield to the Senator from  Kansas <Mr. DoLE). I want to express  my deep appreciation for his speaking  today. There have been many people  speak about the nominee, Ambassador  Adelman, but few have been able to  speak from personal, intimate knowl edge gained from the working relation ship he has had with him.  if  thank  I  think in this regard, we are very  grateful  indeed to Senator DoLE  for  giving us the benefit of his own per sonal experience.  ",1983
292,38,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I  the distinguished chairman.  The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr.  PRESSLER). The Senator from Kansas.  ",1983
293,38,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I do wish  to speak in support of a young man  who has shown considerable  intelli gence  and  leadership  both  at  the  United Nations and  in his grueling  confirmation  hearings. One  cannot  help but wonder, Mr. President, how  many  young Americans would  be  tempted  to  forego  the  financial  re wards of private employment for the  hazards  of Federal  service  they  knew  that their character, sincerity,  and background would be scrutinized  in the manner that Ken Adelman has  had  to  endure  from  some  critics  during  his  extensive  confirmation  hearings.  I do not fault the process. I just sug gest  that we never know when  the  hard questions may come. I think, on  balance, Mr. Adelman has properly re sponded.  What  criticisms  emerged  during  those  hearings, Mr. President? We  first  heard  suggestions  virtually  amounting  to  racial  bias  from  a  strained reading of an article that the  nominee had written regarding South  Africa. As my distinguished colleague  and  fellow Kansan Senator KAssE BAUM noted at the time, such an infer ence would be abhorrent to Ken Adel man, who has  lived and worked  in  Africa. We then heard of a newspaper  article that purported to set forth the  nominee's views on arms control, but  when that newspaper article and its  author were  examined  by Senator  BoscHWITZ, we  discovered  that  the  subject was new to the author. In all  probability-and  intending  no  re proach to the author of that article he simply did not get his story right or  maybe all the facts were not there.  As Senator PERcY has indicated, Mr.  President, I have known Mr. Adelman  in a personal way because he used to  work for me on a part-time basis.  I  have had a chance to visit Mr. Adel man at length. I am not an arms con trol expert, but he helped me on for eign policy as an adviser, as a consult ant. He was recommended to me by a  former Ambassador  to NATO, my  good friend and former colleague  in  the House of Representatives, Robert  Ellsworth,  former Member of Con gress from the State of Kansas. Cer tainly, his recommendation carried a  great deal of weight, and I know of his  support of this nomination and the in tegrity of Mr. Adelman.  I  find nothing whatsoever  in his  background or writings, Mr. President,  to support the theory that Mr. Adel man  finds  arms  control  a  sham.  Indeed, like many of us in this Chamber who place a high value on the na tional security of this country, Adel man wants real reductions in nuclear  arms and a genuine contribution  to  world peace, not  just numbers  that  add up to no progress.  Ken Adelman's own writings confirm  that judgment, Mr. President. He has  pledged himself as committed to arms  control measures that achieve tangible  and far-reaching results. He has cor rectly noted that if the Soviet Union is  as willing as we are, excellent agree ments can be the outcome of our ef forts. During his confirmation hear ings, Adelman  stressed his commit ment to genuine arms control meas ures. He stated that if confirmed, his  overriding objective would be to serve  as an advocate of arms control to the  President. But he has also noted-and  it is a useful reminder for us all-that  the establishment of peace will come  about only as the result of hard bar gaining and mutual agreement on con crete measures which limit the manu facture and use of arms. Empty words  have no utility in achieving the results  which we all seek.  I think that it is salutary to remem ber these cautionary notes, Mr. Presi dent. For while we argue here amongst  ourselves on this topic of central con cern to all mankind, let us not forget  that it is up to the Soviet Union to re spond to our overtures in some con-  structive way. Arms control as every one knows, cannot be a unilateral ven ture. The Senator from Kansas was  keenly disappointed to hear the latest  nyet from the Soviet Union to Presi dent Reagan's recent flexible proposal  for arms control.  I have no doubts  that they will answer seriously only  when they are convinced that deploy ment will proceed. That argues  for  hard  and  fair  bargaining,  not  for  someone who wishes the Soviets were  more reasonable than our entire expe rience has led us to expect. So I am re assured that Ken Adelman, while com mitted to working for arms control, is  also tough minded and realistic in his  view of the difficulties that must be  faced in hammering out an arms con trol agreement.  Finally, Mr. President,  it was said  that the nominee-consistent with his  testimony before  the Foreign Rela tions Committee-refused to consider  personnel matters while his nomina tion was pending. Instead, he passed  on the unsolicited suggestions that he  received to an associate whose views  he  trusted. One wonders, Mr. Presi dent, how those attacking the nominee  would have behaved differently in the  circumstances.  Mr. President, I am not privy to all  the information in that area, but it  seems to me that, in itself, was not a  fatal issue.  The objections all added up, Mr.  President, do not convince me  that  ",1983
294,51,7,Mr. GARN.," Well, there is a disagree ment of opinion, obviously. Some of us  think that he does qualify and he does  send the proper signal. Would the Sen ator from Maryland tell me if he be lieves the Soviets at the INF negotia tions have made a reasonable counter offer  to  the  zero-zero  proposal  of  President Reagan? I should mention  that Paul Nitze, who is respected by  everyone here and in Europe,  is the  one that is in Geneva doing the nego tiating. He  is more  experienced  in  these matters than anybody else.  ",1983
295,51,7,Mr. SARBANES.,"  I  think the walk  that Nitze took in the woods, and the  formulation derived with  the Soviet  counterpart which later got 8 rebuff in  both capitals on reference back, that  that represented potentially a very sig nificant development.  ",1983
296,51,7,Mr. GARN.," I agree. But a walk in  the woods with a couple of negotia tors, and an idea that was immediately  rejected by the Soviet Union and re jected by us does measure up to the  President's zero-zero  proposal. Cer tainly 75 on both sides would be agree able  to me. No doubt about  it. But  that was not their offer. The official  Soviet offer was one I  talked about  before the Senator got here of a ridic ulous 162 with 3 warheads and  the  suggestion that these be matched by  British and French missiles  that do  not have 3 warheads, but only have 1,  and do not have the range to hit many  of the critical military targets in the  Soviet Union. That  is  a  laughable  offer.  ",1983
297,51,7,Mr. SARBANES.," We  are  dealing  with  two factors here. One  is, since  our allies are involved in these matters  we must insure that they perceive we  are approaching this matter seriously.  I  voted  for  the  confirmation  of  Eugene Rostow. I did not agree with  all of Rostow's views. But he was  clearly competent and able, and could  handle the job.  All I am saying to the Senator now is  that while he may disagree with my  perception about Mr. Adelman,  the  view that I am advancing is one held  by a wide  range of opinion  in  this  country and in Europe. To the extent  that this is the case, it undercuts and  weakens the ability of this administra tion to move forward on the arms con trol issue.  ",1983
298,51,7,Mr. GARN.," I do not think there is  any doubt about that, but where does  that impression come from?  ",1983
299,51,7,Mr. SARBANES.,  I  think  from Mr. Adelman.  it came  ,1983
300,51,7,Mr. GARN.," Does it help when we  constantly hear it on the nightly news  night after night after night? Where is  the impression that the Soviets are se rious about arms control?  This administration is serious about  arms control.  I  talked  to President  Reagan,  then  just  private  citizen  Reagan, all during 1979. I constantly  had conversations with him because  he was  interested  in SALT  II. He  wanted  to  learn. Since he became  President, I have had numerous oppor tunities  to  talk  to him about  these  issues and there was nothing that con cerned him more than arms control.  He said he wanted to be very well pre pared before starting the negotiations  because the Soviets had the same bar gainers there that they had for the  last 12 or 13 years.  Maybe I am betraying some confi dence, but I  told some of the people  down at the White House, ""Look, with  what is going on, I recognize you want  to be well prepared, you want to have  well  thought-out options, you don't  want to go over there cold, but this  movement for immediate arms control  is going to come along.""  So  the  only mistake  I  see  the  Reagan administration has made  is  not agreeing to some talks, or about  the shape of the table soon enough, so  that  the  so-called  peace movement  could not say in June 1982 that they  finally forced Ronald Reagan into ne gotiations.  I  resent  that constant  implication  that the President is not serious about  arms control. This man is as serious  about it as you or any other Member  of this body. There is a difference of  opinion in how you treat the Soviet  Union, and history tells me and tells  President Reagan  that you do not  treat them the way we have  in the  past, turning the other cheek and han dling them with kid gloves. You have  to have something to bargain with.  ",1983
301,51,7,Mr. SARBANES.," No; that is not the  point at issue in the debate here. This  debate, and the point I am trying to  make,  is:  accepting  everything  you  have just said, why are we having this  kind of a debate over the nominee to  be the head of the Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency? We ought  to  have a nominee before us of whom vir tually every Member of the Senate can  say: ""This is an outstanding appoint ment. This is the kind of person we all  agree we ought to have to address an  issue of this complexity and this im portance.""  I do not know whether this fellow is  going to make it or not. It is going to  be a very close vote, as I understand it,  which is a comment right there.  Second, you have Members of the  Senate standing up who are going to  support this fellow for very minimal  reasons. They get up and say  they  have examined  the  record and can  reason  to  vote  find  no  compelling  against him.  That is the best argument they can  make. ""We have looked at the record  and we cannot find a reason to vote  against him.''  My colleague from Maryland made  the point yesterday that the presump tion with respect to Presidential nomi nations seems to reach a point where  the President is entitled to any nomi nee he wants except, perhaps, in the  case of a convicted felon or an adjudi cated lunatic.  In a matter of this consequence, we  ought  to have before us a nominee  about whom Members of the Senate  on both sides of the aisle, of differing  views on the nature of the approaches  to arms control, agree that, yes, this is  a person of the highest quality to deal  with an issue of top priority.  That  is clearly not what we have  before us.  The Senator may say, ""Well, it is my  reading that this guy is OK."" Others  of us disagree with that. It seems to  me there are people available the ad ministration could have sent of whom  both you and I would have said, ""That  is a terrific appointment. This is an in credibly  important  issue and we are  putting a first-rate person into the job  to do the best that he can with it.""  ",1983
302,51,7,Mr. GARN.," First of all, this debate  is not solely on the qualifications of  Mr. Adelman. I do not think it was in tended to be that way by some. I think  from the very beginning it was stated  that this was to be a debate on arms  control policy. I think that is what it  has become.  ",1983
303,51,7,Mr. SARBANES.," On  some.  My approach consistently, through out, has been to go to the question of  the qualifications, and my perception  is that in this case they fall short of  what we need  in a position of  this  magnitude and responsibility. We need  a  person of gravity,  of  stature,  a  person who can command the confi dence of not only the Members of the  Senate and of the Congress, but of our  public, and of the publics of Western  Europe, which are important in trying  to resolve that issue. We do not have  that here.  ",1983
304,51,7,Mr. GARN.," Could I answer the Sen ator on the basis of what he has just  outlined, having general agreement on  both sides, what was his opinion of  Paul Warnke? There were more than  40 U.S. Senators who felt very strong ly  that he should not be head of  ACDA. We had a debate at that time.  I assume on the qualities you just  outlined, he was not qualified for the  job because there was so much opposi tion to him. Is that correct?  ",1983

This bill is the result of many  months of work by  the Committee  during the 97th Congress and its pas sage today by the full Senate will pave  the road for final enactment by the  Congress this year.  Mr. President, S. 597 authorizes the  Secretary of Agriculture to convey ap proximately  585.46  acres  of Forest  Service land to the city of Show Low  for  a municipal airport and public  park. The city has been utilizing these  lands for many years through a special  use permit and  the  legislation will  allow  the community  to continue to  provide  these services without addi tional burden to the Federal Govern ment. The city of Show Low  is sur rounded by a national forest and there  is  little private land available in the  area for the community to provide and  expand necessary public services.  The Honorable Mayor Qualls of the  city of Show Low and many other citi zens of this fine community deserve  great credit for their efforts in moving  this legislation forward. On behalf of  the residents of the city of Show Low,  I  thank  the distinguished chairman  and urge my colleagues to give their  support to this worthy legislation.  The bill CS. 597) was passed as fol lows:  S.597  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise  to express my outrage over the most  recent detention of Solidarity Leader  Lech Walesa by  the Communist au thorities  in  Poland. Reports  from  Gdansk,  today,  indicate that Walesa  was seized by armed security police  and taken from his home early this  morning. This action  is yet another  example of officially sanctioned har assment of Walesa, who was confined  for more than 11 months as a result of  his efforts on behalf of Polish work ers. While this is not the first provoca tion since his release last November,  the timing of this act of blatant disre gard for Walesa's civil liberties is most  significant.  The International Labor Organiza tion has repeatedly requested permis sion to send a representative to Poland  in order to investigate the Jaruzelski  regime's  continued  denial  of  basic  rights to Poland's 19 million workers.  Thus far, the Polish Government has  rejected  such  requests.  In addition,  Wa.lesa's detention raises serious ques tions with regard to the papal visit by  John Paul II, scheduled for June.  As a member of the Commission on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, I  am particularly concerned over  the  unwarranted  incarceration  of Lech  Walesa and I encourage Members of  the Congress and the administration  to speak out in support of this brave  individual and the oppressed people of  Poland.e  OUR NATION'S BANKS: PROFITING FROM THEIR MISTAKES  e ",1983
337,103,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  proponents of an $8.5 billion expan sion of the U.S. commitment to the  International Monetary Fund have in cluded  among  their  arguments  the  point that an increase in the Fund's  resources will protect the stability of  the  international banking system  in  general,  and more  particularly  the  standing of many of our Nation's larg est  banks. After  reading  the  1983  Annual Banking Survey, published in  the April 11 issue of Forbes magazine,  one cannot help but wonder if anyone  has bothered to tell the banks that  they are supposed to be in so much  trouble.  As  the survey's authors point out,  the banks have adopted tactical book keeping maneuvers to insure that the  real  impact of  their shaky  foreign  loans does not filter through to the  bottom  line. An  increase  in  the re sources of the IMF will lead directly to  greater  demands  for  private  bank  lending, which in turn will cause this  charade to be played out still further.  If 1983 is going to be as good a year  for the banks as the analysts predict,  Mr. President, they should not fear a  partial write-down of these  loans  to  more realistic values. If the predicted  performance of the banking industry  is illusory, it is all the more reason to  guard against a situation in which in capable  foreign  borrowers will pull  them more deeply into the hole simply  because the IMF, in a market-defying  allocation of capital, makes its assist ance contingent upon greater bank ex posure. In essence, the time has come  to reject the IMF quota increase and  to rely upon the free marketplace to  expose the reality of the international  ",1983
338,129,7,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, in the  world of tensions between the U.S.S.R.  and the United States, at least there is  one ray of hope today, and that is the  news  that  the Pentecostalists who  have been, in effect, restrained in the  U.S. Embassy, restrained because they  were afraid to leave because they were  afraid they would not be able to emi grate, have at last found hope  that  they can emigrate.  Let us hope that  this will not be  thwarted; that they will be allowed to  emigrate;  that the U.S.S.R. and the  United States will have backed off  from a potentially embarrassing and  upsetting  circumstance.

339,129,7,Mr. SAVAGE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  just  rise on  this happy occasion  to an nounce  that democracy  is alive and  well in the city of Chicago. That great  industrial, bustling center of varied  ethnicity, on the shores of Lake Michi gan, believe it or not, is still afloat.  Although we  are going  to  lose  a  great colleague of ours because of his  election last night, Chicago will gain a  great mayor,  thanks  to  the help of  many of you and the national leaders  of our fine Democratic Party.  As our colleague, HARoLD WASHING TON, was quoted in a paper this morn ing:  The whole Nation was watching and Chi cago sent a profound message out of the  crucible of our city's most trying election.

SUPPORT OF THE EMERGENCY  HOUSING RELIEF ACT  <Mr. RICHARDSON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  ",1983
340,129,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  one of the aspects of the American  dream is owning your own home. Mil lions of Americans have toiled away in  our factories, our mines, and markets  in search of the financial resources to  realize that dream.  This cruel recession that started 2  years ago has dashed that dream for  many Americans. Many people in my  district are out of work as a result of  the worst economic downturn  in 50  years. The recession has stopped the  demand  for  copper,  uranium,  and  other minerals mined in northern New  Mexico. The  lifeline of employment  for so many thousands in my district  has been cut off and families are faced  with the horror of not being able to  make their house payments. Some are  faced with the prospect of losing their  homes.  Mr. Speaker, some 61,000 New Mexi cans would  fall within the scope of  this legislation. That is a clear indica tion of how many people in my State  are in dire need of relief. The Emer gency Housing Assistance Act will be  an important first step for the people  of my district and homeowners across  the country to keep their homes while  they wait for the recession to end and  for their jobs to return.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Emergency Housing Assistance Act. I  commend my distinguished colleague  from the State of Texas, the chairman  of  the Housing Subcommittee,  for  bringing to the floor a piece of legisla tion that will show that we in the Con gress have compassion in our hearts  and  that we want all Americans  to  have a place that they can call home.  U.S. FINANCING FORMER  SOMOZA SECURITY GUARDS  <Mr. BEDELL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
341,129,7,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  tell the House about a trip that I took  this weekend to Honduras and Nicara gua.  I was absolutely shocked and amazed  by what I saw on that trip. Everybody  there knows that the United States is  financing  an  effort  by  Somoza's  former security forces  to move from  Honduras into Nicaragua to raid the  common citizens of that country,  to  kidnap  them,  to murder  them, and  this sort of activity. They all know  that it is the United States, and I hope  that we realize that we are doing the  financing.  First of all,  it is morally wrong.  I  wish you could have been with me and  met with the mothers whose children  had been killed by those former secu rity forces.  Second,  it  is  surely pragmatically  wrong. Do we think for 1 minute that  we  are  going  to  do  anything but  strengthen the hold of the Sandinista  government on the people by arming  former criminals to come back and kill  the people within  that country? As  one of the Sandinistas told me:  If you really want democracy, we cannot  understand why it would be that you would  want the former security guard of Somoza  to come back and take over our country.  I would hope that the people of this  body would look at what is really hap pening and  rise up and  take what  action should be taken to stop this ter rible, terrible activity of our Govern ment.  REAGAN'S ARMS CONTROL  POLICIES  <Mr. BLILEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
342,129,7,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  take the opportunity, as we prepare to  continue consideration of the nuclear  freeze resolution,  to praise President  Reagan for his initiative in presenting  a farsighted approach to arms control  negotiations with the Soviet Union.  Every rational person in the world  wants  to get  rid of all  the nuclear  weapons  that currently exist and to  produce no new ones. There have been  negotiations toward that goal for more  than 20 years among most of the na11-059 Q-87 -5 (Pt. 7)  ",1983
343,142,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," I do not believe  I am in a position to give you the spe cifics on the START talks. I merely in dicate in my resolution in support of  those talks that are going on, not only  the START talks but the IMF talks,  basically as far as the details of those,  I am not obviously aware of every thing that has been under consider ation, and they keep changing as they  are meeting there. But I am in support  of those talks.  Mr. AuCOIN. Here is the reason I  asked the question: The freeze cannot  be understood as a statement or reflec tion of congressional interest, a policy  interest on the part of the Congress  unless  it  is understood against  the  policy objectives of the START negoti ations. That is why the freeze  is on  the floor today.  One  of  the weaknesses,  of  the  START negotiations, and indeed, one  of the strengths of the freeze resolu tion, is that in the case of bombers,  bombers are frozen under the freeze  but not under START. Let me  just  give the gentleman a couple of exam ples.  The Backfire bomber: The Soviet  Union has 180 of these today. Under  the freeze, they would be left there at  180. Under START there is no limit.  As many dreaded Backfire bombers as  possible could be built.  The Blackjack bomber: The Black jack bombers, which all of us are con cerned about, and do not want the So viets  to develop,  and produce,  and  deploy, they have one on a test basis  right now. Under the freeze, because  the  freeze  deals with bombers and  START does not, under  the  freeze  they would be  left with one. If we  want to stop the Blackjack, the freeze  is the way to do it. The START negoti ations leaves that unlimited.  I want to add one other thing.  ",1983

346,142,7,Mr. CARNEY.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I  think what might  be equally as important as we look at  the START negotiations and the IMF  negotiations in the same vein as the  gentleman in the well is looking at it,  that is we would freeze in 351 SS-20's,  250 SS-4's and SS-5's Soviet missiles,  to zero NATO response in Europe.  We feel that if the Broomfield reso lution, which supports both START  and the IMF, would allow for the lati tude  for  reductions,  reductions not  only on the Soviet side but reductions  on the U.S. side, there is nothing that  would prohibit  the START negotia tors from freezing fixed-wing aircraft  at the levels  that they are at right  now. Indeed, their emphasis has been  on  intercontinental ballistic missiles,  but they certainly can change the lati tude of the START negotiations, and I  do not think it would be proper  to  freeze in the SS-29levels now.

356,142,7,Mr. CARNEY., I thank the Chair.  ,1983
357,142,7,Mr. LEVITAS.,"  In fact, Mr. Chair man,  let me,  if  I may,  take  just a  moment to explain the parliamentary  situation we are now in at this junc ture.  When the Committee of the Whole  rose for consideration of this bill on  the last occasion, there was then pend ing an amendment in the nature of a  subsitute which I had offered, known  as the mutual guaranteed build-down  proposal.  It  D 1310  is  that business which  is now  before the full committee and which I  hope we will address during the next  few moments.  I want to get back to this position  because I feel it is an extremely impor tant and serious proposal within the  context of the arms control discussion.  The proponents of a nuclear  freeze  and those who have taken the leader ship in the movement have certainly  provided an important service to the  Nation in terms of focusing attention  and marshaling the concerns of the  American people, and people through out the world, on the possibility of  avoiding a nuclear catastrophe.  I think it is also important to recog nize that those who have supported  the so-called nuclear freeze and those  who prefer to go directly to negotia tions  for  reduction  really  have  a  common purpose, and  that common  purpose is to make this world a safer  place  in  a  nuclear  age. That  is  a  common purpose, and it is  for  that  reason that I believe the guaranteed  mutual build-down approach has con siderable merit that is worthy of adop tion by this committee, because it says  to those who favor a freeze in terms of  nuclear capability that there will be  no  increase  in  nuclear warheads:  indeed there will be a guaranteed re duction of nuclear warheads. So we  have built in, if you will, a freeze in  terms of nuclear warheads which are  the source of nuclear destruction.  For those who believe we ought to  talk about  reductions-and certainly  we had all better be addressing our selves to reducing the nuclear poten tial in this world-it guarantees a re duction of nuclear warheads. There fore, I submit that both parties who  have  approached  this  concern  can  come together in adopting the mutual  guaranteed build-down.  The mutual guaranteed build-down  is a concept which the United States,  through the President, would propose  to the Soviet Union within the context  of existing arms control discussions,  and it would say that for every new  warhead that is added to either side's  arsenal a certain number-and we pro",1983
358,155,7,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise in support of the Levitas amend ment. It offers a  reasonable alterna tive which should satisfy both sides.  Some commentators are billing the  upcoming vote on House Joint Resolu tion 13 as being historic, the first offi cial statement that the Congress of  the United States is in favor of putting  a stop to the arms race as a prelude to  ending that race. Melodramatic rheto ric aside, I rise to question the use of  the term ""historic"" as well as the logic  of concluding that this freeze will help  end the arms  race.  It seems  to me  that, if you remove any incentive one  side might have to negotiate an equi table  reduction of nuclear weapons,  the end result will be either a continu ation of the arms race or an ever wors ening strategic situation for the other  side or both.  The word ""historic"" implies that the  event under discussion  is either un precedented or of momentous signifi cance. However,  this  is not the first  time Americans, or peace loving peo ples of other nations, have attempted  to legislate an arms reduction agree ment or an agreement limiting produc tion  or  deployment  of  a weapons  system considered  to be particularly  dangerous. Indeed, what is so interest ing about this particular effort is not  that is plows new ground, but rather  that it goes over ground plowed so un successfully in the past which, in turn,  suggests the effort is not momentous  in a positive sense.  No one likes to think that war is in evitable or that a sound and lasting  peace  is  impossible  to achieve, but  during more than 4,000 years of re corded  human  history,  there  have  been very few years in which no war  has been fought. In just the 206 years  since  the Declaration of  Independ ence, America has fought no less than  10 wars-6 declared, 3 undeclared and  1 civil-spanning 29 years in time. In  each case, this Nation came to its own  defense or that of its allies, but the  fact we have not been in the habit of  initiating wars has not kept us out of  them. In short, the pages of history  clearly suggest that a national desire  to stay out of war is an insufficient  guarantee  that  a  nation  can have  peace and yet stay  free. For every  nation like Switzerland there must be  10 examples of nations that have had  to fight for their freedom or have seen  that freedom go by the boards.  Just as the desire for peace has not  been an antedote for war, neither have  broad declarations of peace or one sided disarmament  agreements kept  war from breaking out. No better ex ample of that grim reality exists than  the era between World Wars I and II.  In 1922, for example, a naval agree ment was reached calling on many of  the world's naval powers to limit war ship construction, yet that agreement  did not forestall Japan from building  up their navy to the point where it  could  launch  a  devastating  sneak  attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1928, the  United States and many other nations  signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which  essentially outlawed war but its exist ence did not deter Japan from invad ing Manchuria,  Italy  from  invading  Ethiopia, or Germany from invading  Poland and starting World War  II.  Neither did the self-imposed Neutrali ty Acts of the 1930's, which put strict  limitations  on  the  kinds  of  goods  American companies could ship over seas, keep  the United States out of  World War II. Nor did  the Munich  Pact of 1938, which the British Prime  Minister hailed as ""peace in our time,""  keep the Germans from swallowing up  the other half of Czechoslovakia 6  months later. The key to any peace  agreement or disarmament arrange ment lies in the ability of its adher ents to enforce it. And without a mili tary capability clearly perceived to be  at least equal to,  if not superior to,  any and all others, such enforcement  efforts are doomed to failure, if indeed  they are launched at all. Potential ag gressors have never viewed a sheaf of  papers as a substitute for an adequate  military deterrent;  if anything,  the  substitution of words for weapons has  been viewed as a sign of weakness de serving of exploitation.  It is often argued that nuclear weap ons are so horrible that no one would  dare start a war, especially since either  of  the  superpowers  supposedly has  enough nuclear weapons to totally de stroy the other. However, the history  of weapons and war pokes holes in the  first  argument  and  logic  says  the  second  is  questionable  on  the one  hand and limited in its applicability on  the other. Of course, nuclear weapons  have a  terrible potential for destruc tion, when compared to conventional  air warfare for instance, but think of  the terror that must have been felt by  the swordsmen, spearthrowers and ci vilians of the Middle Ages when gun power was  first  introduced and  the  musket became a weapon war. Yet  that terror did not prevent the advent  of another war. Think too how 19th  century soldiers must have felt when  the forerunner of the machine gun the gatling gun-cut  them down  in  rows as they tried to advance on an  enemy position. Yet that terror did  not prevent  the outbreak of World  ",1983
359,168,7,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  for  me the time has come when I must  cast my vote for this resolution provid ing for an immediate, mutual, verifia ble freeze on the testing, production,  and deployment of nuclear weapons.  We must do this because we are here  as the representatives of the American  people, and I  think there can be no  doubt that this resolution has  their  overwhelming support.  Those of us who were out among the  people during the Easter recess, listen ing to their voices, hearing their pleas,  have come back to Washington with  the realization that-in this debate we are not  leading  them. They are  leading us.  The people have grasped the nuclear  danger to the world. And they have a  strong sense that the time to save it is  fast running out.  World War  II was  ended by  the  dropping of what were,  by  today's  measure,  two  puny  little  atomic  bombs. The destruction and the terror  of that primitive weaponry were such  that to continue the war became un thinkable.  In the 38 years since Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, our scientists and military  planners have enlarged and  refined  and adapted the instruments of global  death. Today,  the product of  their  work is so awesome and so terrifying  that  the human mind cannot  fully  comprehend its finality.  The  resolution before  the House  today is not the frightened cry of cow ards, but the strong call of the brave.  It is the voice of a nation that wants  not only to save itself from destruc tion, but to spare its enemies as well.  It does not strip a  single weapon  from our arsenal. It does not lessen  our strength one iota. It simply says to  those other nations that possess nucle ar capability and who are  engaged  with us in a race to produce even more  terrible weapons: Let us stop. Let us  stop now, before it is too late for any  of us.  The resolution does not abort or un dercut a.I,lY arms reduction talks with  which this Nation is engaged with the  Soviet Union. If anything, it strength ens America's hand in those talks.  It tells the negotiators of both sides  that one of their major goals should  be deciding when and how to achieve a  mutual and verifiable freeze on  the  testing, production, and deployment of  nuclear weapons.  It assures our allies as well as our en emies that we are very serious indeed  in our desire to negotiate agreements  that  can  eventually  reduce  the  number  of  nuclear weapons  that  threaten the planet. A vote for  this  resolution  is  a  pledge of our good  faith.  In my lifetime, I have seen war first hand as an American soldier on a foreign field. By the standards of 40 years  ago,  it was  terrible war. When  it  ended, there were winners and losers.  Both sides walked away, and we all  began the task of rebuilding what we  had destroyed.  That, I am sorry to say, would be a  quaint and old-fashioned  idea today.  In a nuclear war,  there are no win ners-there are only  losers. Nobody  walks away, and nothing is left to re build.  There  are  those who  say  that a  freeze  on nuclear weapons,  even  a  mutual freeze, would give an advan tage to the Soviet Union. I do not be lieve  that. And neither, apparently,  does the President's own special com mission on the MX missile that report ed  this week. Somehow,  the much  talked-about window of vulnerability  has disappeared.  I am sure that not one member of  our Joint Chiefs of Staff would swap  our defense capability for that of the  Russians.  We are militarily strong, and the res olution before us today speaks from  our strength. We must pass it.  ",1983

365,168,7,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding  this  time  to  me.  Mr. Chairman, I would like  to ex plain briefly the reason I objected to a  time limitation before was that I had  not had an opportunity  to read the  Levitas amendment.  I have the same concerns similar to  those expressed by our colleague, the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  <Mr.  AsPIN).  I am of  the opinion  that a  builddown as a part of this freeze reso lution could actually put us in more of  an  inferior position  than  the freeze  itself. The reason I say that is since we  began converting or modernizing our  Minuteman forces to the Minuteman  III  configuration,  the Soviets  have  fielded  three brand new ICBM mis siles.  That means that their force modern ization is way ahead of ours, and if we  want to get any kind of a moderniza tion program to try to keep some kind  of a parity, we are going to have to  modernize but under this amendment  build down at the same time. The So viets  have  already modernized  and  they do not have that same require ment.  I am just really worried about what  we are getting ourselves into.  When the Levitas amendment was  actually a  substitute  for  the  freeze  and,  therefore, was more a political  ploy to do away with the freeze, I was  prepared  to  support  it,  to be very  honest with you, because I knew, had  it been adopted, the leadership would  have pulled the resolution from  the  floor and there would have been no  further action.  But, now we find a different animal.  Now we have a perfecting amendment  to the freeze and that makes it a far  more serious matter. In my opinion,  and I think we ought to pay close at tention to not the politics of it but ex actly what does this do to our strategic  position relative to the Soviet Union. I  think  it  is more  serious  than  the  freeze itself.  ",1983

367,168,7,Mr. ASPIN.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Florida has made exactly  the point  that I was going to make, and I think  that the object of a 2-for-1 builddown  is in itself an interesting idea, but we  need some hearings on the idea. We  need  to state exactly what kinds of  systems we are going to be interested  in producing  in order  to have  that  builddown.  I think it would be very, very risky  to do  this resolution,  to put this as  part of the freeze resolution.  Just in response to the comment of  the gentleman from Illinois, the freeze  is not exactly the same leap  in the  dark that the Levitas amendment is.  We did, as I understand it, have hear ings in the appropriate committees.  ",1983
368,181,7,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I am just as weary as  anybody  in  this  room and maybe a  little more so of debating this issue. It  is  absolutely,  positively  a  political  issue, not arms control, and never was  that more  graphically  underscored  than by  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Iowa, which I am  sure is consonant with the dictates of  ""the freeze movement.""  Notice the absence of a ""reductions  movement."" Notice the hangup on the  word ""freeze"" which, of course, stops  modernization, keeps us in the antique  category as far as our weaponry is con cerned, and prevents us from respond ing to the SS-20's, 354  triple-headed  SS-20's aimed at Western Europe.  There is no reason in logic or in com monsense why you cannot reduce as  well as freeze.  Why in the world are you so hung  up on ""first we  freeze and  then we  reduce""?  The gentleman f;rom  Iowa has just  said our European allies want us to be  forthcoming on arms  control. Why  chose the door and just say talk about  freeze first? Why not leave the option  to reduce?  Is  there  something  incompatible  with  arms  control, with  fostering  peace, that says you cannot reduce?  What if the Soviets want to reduce?  We cannot talk to them?  We are going to have to negotiate a  freeze first.  Freezing first requires negotiations  on inventory, on verification. If you  think verification is going to be easy to  negotiate, you do not understand the  subject.  If you ask anyone in the intelligence  community how many atom bombs  Israel has, do you know what answer  you get? It is from zero to 200. We do  not know. That is a  little country, a  free country  the size of a  postage  stamp compared to Russia, and we do  not know.  But now we are going to verify nu clear weapons production and deploy ment in the Soviet Union.  To negotiate  the verification will  take years. What nonsense to foreclose  our negotiators from being able to dis cuss reductions.  The President no  longer can say,  ""We will cut it in two; we will elimi nate this; we will eliminate that."" We  have got to freeze first.  That  is not  forthcoming. That  is  stupid. I cannot see why you have to  march to the drum of the freeze move ment because they are hung up on the  word ""freeze.""  Reductions, disappearance of all nu clear weapons, ought to be the ulti mate goal. Why not at least let that  word  creep  into  the  resolution  by  saying  that,  too,  is an objective of  what we are doing.  I yield back the balance of my time.  I  is  Objection  CHAIRMAN.

372,181,7,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Iowa to the amendment.  I think it is very fitting that we have  discussed in the last few minutes the  history of arms negotiations, because  in effect what  the gentleman  from  Iowa and the gentleman from Wiscon sin would really have us consider here  today on the floor of the House is not  the first freeze that the United States  has ever been  involved  in, but  the  second.  In fact, when the SALT I agreement  was adopted-! do not know how many  Members were here a number of years  ago when that debate raged-it was  really .said to be a freeze that would  stop the endless escalating arms race.  And let me,  if I might, depict this  graphically for my colleagues.  Prior to th.e SALT agreement, which  I call the freeze that failed, the rela tive  force  structures of both  sides  looked something like this. The Sovi ets had deployed two strategic bomb ers, the United States one. Both sides  had deployed a relative parity in both  ballistic  missiles  and  submarine  launched missiles,  as well  as  three  classes of ballistic submarines.  The Soviets then developed two very  large missiles,  one  of which was  MIRV. The SS-9, both Mod-3  and  Mod-4.  And  the United States  responded  with a new submarine launched mis sile,  the Poseidon, which was  also  MIRV'ed.  That is the background that forced  us  into SALT  I, an escalating arms  race on both sides, and approximate  parity, a trip to the bargaining table in  the hopes to freeze this escalating sit uation.  Now let us see how SALT I worked  to accomplish its goal of a freeze. Kis singer, Ambassador Smith, and Mel  Laird all testified in the background of  SALT I that indeed this would have  the effect of a freeze. In fact, we gave  up our ABM system with the explicit  understanding that the Soviets would  indeed not develop any counterforce  capability, any counterforce weapons.  In fact, Secretary Laird said at the  time that it would be a violation of  SALT I if the Soviets did indeed devel op  some capability  that  threatened  our deterrent.  How did that freeze work? The Sovi ets proceeded with aggressive, unre lenting development of new ICBM's,  new SLBM's and new bombers. They  deployed  six new classes of subma rines. And in this entire timeframe, be tween SALT I and the period we are  presently  in,  the United States de ployed one new submarine missile, a  new warhead on an old missile,  the  Minuteman  III. And  finally, within  the last year, an air launch cruise mis sile.  If indeed we go  forward with  the  President's modernization program, we  will then wind up with a force struc ture  that looks something  like  this,  where the United States attempts to  gain back some of  that parity  that  serves  as  a  deterrent  against  the  Soviet first strike and new generations  of Soviet missiles, SS-18, the new solid  missile, an air launch cruise missile,  and a new submarine missile, and an other bomber, the Blackjack.  That is the situation that we have  found ourselves in today.  So virtually what we have done uni laterally is imposed a freeze upon our selves. In fact, since 1967 this country  has not dug one new silo, not one, and  has only deployed in those almost 15,  16 years one new submarine, put into  operation last December.  I would suggest that if we adopt this  resolution here as it presently reads as  presented by the gentleman from Wis consin and as amended by the amend ment of the gentleman from Iowa and  the  amendment  by  the  gentleman  from Colorado <Mr. BROWN), what we  will wind up with is the second freeze  that failed, not the first.

All of us  want security. All of us want a world  free from nuclear weapons in which  nuclear weapons are obsolete. But to  simply go forward with another unilat",1983
374,194,7,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of House Joint Resolu tion 13, a deserving initiative calling  for negotiations toward a mutual and  verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons to  be followed by equitable reductions in  strategic systems. It is my belief that  the resolution before us today conveys  the deep concern of those we repre sent about the arms race. The continu ing buildup of  the nuclear arsenals  places the prospect for true arms re duction further and further from our  grasp. It is  time to at least attempt  through negotiation to halt the esca lating nuclear arms race before we are  powerless to do so.  One  provision  of  the  resolution  which I strongly endorse states that,  ""Negotiations toward a freeze should  give special attention to destabilizing  weapons, especailly those which give  either nation capabilities which confer  upon it even the hypothetical advan tage of a first strike."" In an interesting  parallel, the report of the President's  Commission on Strategic Force advo cates similar emphasis in arms control  negotiations by  recommending  that,  ""We should try to promote an evolu tion toward forces in which each side  is encouraged to see to the survivabil ity of its own forces in a way that does  not threaten the other."" I believe that  negotiations toward a mutual and veri fiable  freeze must begin now, and I  strongly encourage my colleagues  to  join me in voting for the resolution.e  e ",1983
375,194,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  House considers today a unique propo sition. Unique not because of its mag nitude, its subject, or because of the  controversy surrounding it. The pro posal  for  a mutual  and  verifiable  freeze on the testing, production and  deployment  of  nuclear weapons  unique  in  its origin,  its momentum,  and in the fact that no matter what  we here today decide to do with it, it  will eventually succeed. The American  people are behind it, united in a way  as  they have not been since World  War II. They will not be denied.  We  here  in Washington did not  think of the freeze. We did not pro pose it to our constituents. They have  presented it to us, and have demanded  its passage by this House. The beauty  of the freeze resolution is its simpliciis  ty. Clearly, it could never have been  developed  in one of our committee  rooms. One does not need a lawyer or  a defense analyst to understand it. My  constituents understand it. They un derstand that despite 40 years of com plicated solutions to the arms race, we  are less safe than ever before. They  understand that the testing, produc tion, and deployment of nuclear arms  has  to be stopped.  I support House  Joint Resolution 13 because I think it  is a good idea, but more importantly  because  I was  instructed  to by  the  people of the Fifth District of Iowa. I  am certain that if every Member of  this House voted as  the majority of  their constituents want them to, this  resolution would pass.  Now is the perfect time to adopt a  freeze, for the United States to negoti ate one with the Soviet Union. Our nu clear forces are in a state of rough  equivalency with the Soviet Union. We  have more  strategic  nuclear war heads-9,600 versus 8,000. We have  twice as many  tactical nuclear war heads-20,000 versus 10,000. Our sub marine missile force is far larger, more  accurate, and more reliable. We have  more long-range bombers, with greater  range and better avionics. There are  U.S. nuclear forces within range of the  U.S.S.R.  in Europe and  the Pacific,  the Soviets have nothing comparable.  Most importantly, we maintain a nu clear arsenal balanced between  the  land, air, and sea; 70 percent of the  Soviet  strategic  nuclear  forces  are  based on land, making them almost  completely dependent on forces most  vulnerable  to a surprise attack. The  Soviets have four potential nuclear ad versaries-the United States, Britain,  France, and China-and is surrounded  by potential enemies. We have peace ful borders and only one potential ad versary in a nuclear war.  Russia has some advantages. Their  ICBM's are larger and usually carry  more powerful warheads. They have  more  land-based and sea-based mis siles, and more strategic delivery vehi cles, although the United States still  leads in total warheads since our mis siles are heavily MIRV'ed. They also  have a greater total explosive power,  or megatonnage. These advantages are  really symptoms of a force that makes  up with size and power what it lacks in  accuracy and reliability.  All of  this adds up  to a state of  rough equivalency. Before we start on  a new arms race, let us stop now while  we are ahead. Let us stop now before  there comes the day when survivors of  a nuclear war pick through the radio active rubble and wonder who was the  winner.  Some have other  ideas. Over and  over, we  hear  the  call,  sometimes  plaintive and sometimes strident, for  reductions  in nuclear  forces  rather  than the freeze. Under the misleading  ",1983

377,207,7,Mr.  LAFALCE.," Mr.  Speaker,  in  recent  years we  have  heard  stern  warning that our Nation is courting a  crisis in its preparation of students in  math,  science, engineering, and  for eign languages. Almost daily, we are  assaulted with  statistics,  testimony,  and anecdotes which represent mount ing evidence of softness in our educa tional product. The implications of the  pending crisis affect not only our Na tion's economic stability and growth,  but also our defense capabilities and  national security.  Today, I would like to address this  pressing need which our country faces  and  introduce  the National Defense  Education Act of 1983. At the heart of  the legislation is a full-scale Federal  commitment  to math,  science,  engi neering, and foreign language educa tion. I believe this commitment is cru cial  to the  improvement of our Na tion's productivity growth rate, inter national competitiveness, overall eco nomic well-being, and national securi ty.  The task before us is monumental,  but it is not impossible. The Soviet's  launching of sputnik 25 years ago sent  a powerful message to America's polit ical  and  educational  establishment.  Since the 1940's, the trend in educa tion had been toward the social devel opment of children rather than em phasizing  basic  academic  subject  matter. Russia's exploit in space high lighted the costs of neglecting rigorous  academic  training,  particularly  in  mathematics and sciences.  In short, sputnik was a rude awaken ing for our Nation's leaders. This tech nological and  scientific  feat  threat ened not only our national pride, but  more importantly, our national securi ty.  It was  this  realization which  spurred our Nation's leaders  to act.  Congress in 1958 passed the National  Defense Education Act which funded  university research and development  projects, and provided scholarships to  young people  interested  in pursuing  technological careers.  In proposing the National Defense  Education Act of 1983, I am confident  that we  in Congress can develop a  counterpart to the critical legislation  of the late 1950's and 1960's. As John  F. Kennedy spoke of the New Frontier  in the the 1960's, the educational and  technological era of  the 1980's and  1990's presents its own challenges. The  reality to be faced is that competition  between nations is increasingly being  fought on the economic front. Nations  are judged strong or weak by the vital ity of their economies, the modernity  of their industrial plant, and the qual ity of their advanced research.  Twenty-five years after the Sputnik,  educators,  scientists,  industrialists,  and other concerned citizens are again  declaring that American children are  not being adequately educated. Clear  evidence exists of a  lack of technical  preparedness,  shortages  of  certified  teachers in math and science, and in sufficient foreign langauge competen cy. The urgency to act to reverse this  trend  is made more apparent when  one looks at the following data:  ( 1) LACK OF TECHNICAL PREPAREDNESS  The U.S. Department of Labor esti mates that there were 17,000 unfilled  entry-level engineering jobs in 1980.

379,246,7,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues'  attention some correspondence I have  had with the Department of State on  the desirability of a State Department  official meeting with Mr. Mustafa  Dudeen,  the principal  leader of  the  Village Leagues, a Palestinian organi zation operating with Israeli support  in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.  Because  it  important  for  the  United States  to maintain as broad  contact as possible with a wide cross section of Palestinian groups and lead ers, the United States cannot ignore  the Village Leagues. It is hoped that  current policy of not meeting with Vil lage League officials will be reviewed  in the coming months. Such a meeting  can take place without conveying sup port for  the Village Leagues or  its  members. The Village Leagues will ul timately obtain power and legitimacy  is  April 13, 1983  only through solid support within the  Palestinian community and not from  meetings with American diplomats.  The correspondence follows:  COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., March 1, 1983.  Hon. GEORGE P. SHULTZ,  Secretary, Department of State, Washington,  D.C.  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I had the opportuni ty recently to meet with Mustafa Dudeen  and other officials of the Israeli-sponsored  West Bank Village Leagues while they were  in Washington.  I have tended to support the elected offi cials of the Palestinians, but I nonetheless  feel  that it is  important that the United  States maintain as broad contact as possible  with as many Palestinian  individuals and  Palestinian  organizations  as  possible.  I  would like to know why United States offi cials, even at a low level, will not meet with  Mr. Dudeen or other officials of the Village  Leagues. I believe it is in our interest to be  talking to as wide a spectrum of Palestinian  opinions as we possibly can.  I  appreciate your consideration of  this  letter and hope that you will give serious  consideration to the possibility of a meeting  with Mr. Dudeen  in  the  future. Such a  meeting would be conducted without con veying any sense of support for the Village  Leagues or its specific members.  I look forward to hearing from you on this  matter in the near future.  With best regards,  Sincerely yours,  LEE H. HAMILTON,  Chairman, Subcommittee on  Europe and the Middle East.  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE  Washington, D.C., March 24, 1983.  DEAR MR.  IIAMILTON: This is  in reply to  your letter of March 1,  in which you ask  why United States officials, even at a  low  level,  have  not met with Mr. Mustafa  Dudeen or other officials of  the  Israeli sponsored West Bank Village Leagues.  As a matter of policy and principle, we  very much agree with your comment that it  is important that the United States main tain as broad contact as possible with a wide  range of Palestinian individuals and organi zations. Within this context, however, it is  our obligation to assess what impact meet ing with, or not meeting with, a given indi vidual or organization will have on our over arching  interest  in  achieving  expanded  peace negotiations on the basis of the Presi dent's September 1 initiative.  As you are aware, Mr. Dudeen and the Vil lage Leagues are widely perceived on the  West Bank and elsewhere as being key ele ments of a concerted Israeli effort to dis credit and strip away the influence of the  elected local Arab leadership. This leader ship  includes both the mayors who have  been removed from office and those who  have been expelled from the area <notably,  Mohammed Milhem of Halhul and Fuad  Kawasme of Hebron> by the Israeli authori ties. Much as we disagree with many of the  positions held by these leaders, we frankly  do not believe it would serve our larger in terest if we were to seem to acquiesce in or  lend sustenance to the active effort to sup plant them with Village League figures. It is  our judgment that such would inevitably be  the  implication of  a meeting with Mr.  Dudeen or his colleagues at this delicate  stage.  ",1983
380,259,7,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, please  allow me the privilege of reprinting, in  the RECORD, for the benefit of my col leagues  the  report  entitled,  ""The  Report of the Secretary General on  the Work of the Organization""-1982.  The Secretary General of the United  Nations, Javier De Cuellar, points out  in his eloquent and learned address his  belief  that  the only way  for world  peace to exist is when the five perma nent members of the Security Council  resolve their differences and use their  power collectively to prevent war, as  they agreed  to do  in writing when  each signed the U.N. Charter. I think  we could all benefit by thoughtfully  considering  the Secretary General's  remarks.  The report follows:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  [Original: English, September 19821  REPORT OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL ON THE  WoRK OF THE ORGANIZATION  The past year has seen an alarming suc cession of  international crises as well as  stalemates on a number of  fundamental  international  issues. The United Nations  itself has been unable to play as effective  and decisive a role as the Charter certainly  envisaged for it. Therefore, in this, my first  annual report to the General Assembly, I  shall depart from the usual practice of sur veying the broad range of the work of the  United Nations; instead I shall focus on the  central problem of the Organization's capac ity  to keep  the peace and  to serve as a  forum for negotiations. I shall try to ana lyse its evident difficulties in doing so, diffi culties related to conflicts between national  aims and Charter goals and to the current  tendency  to  resort  to confrontation, vio lence and even war in pursuit of what are  perceived as vital interests, claims or aspira tions. The general  international divisions  and disorder which have characterized the  past year have unquestionably made it even  more difficult than usual for the Organiza tion to be, as it was intended to be, a centre  for harmonizing the actions of nations in  the attainment of common ends.  The problems faced by the United Nations  in fulfilling its mission derive in large meas ure  from  the difficulties which Govern ments appear to have in coming to terms,  both within and outside the Organization,  with the harsh realities of the time in which  we live. This question is, of course, highly  relevant to the use, misuse or non-use of the  United Nations as an instrument for peace  and rational change.  I am of the view that we now have poten tially better means  to solve many of the  major problems facing humanity than ever  before. For this reason I retain, in the last  analysis, a sense of optimism. This basic op timism, however, is tempered by our appar ent inability to make adequate use of these  means. Instead we sometimes appear still to  be in the grip of the dead hand of a less for tunate past. As a result we often lack the  vision  to differentiate between short-term  advantage and long-term progress, between  politically expedient positions and the indis pensable objective of creating a civilized and  peaceful world order. While such attitudes  do not affect the validity of the ideals of the  Charter, they seriously impair the proper  utilization of the machinery of the United  Nations for the purposes for which it was  set up.  We live today in the presence of a chilling  and unprecedented phenomenon. At  the  peak of world power there exist enough nu clear weapons to destroy life on our planet.  It seems evident that nothing worthwhile  would survive such a holocaust, and  this  fact, above all else, contains  the nuclear  confrontation-for the time being at least.  In the middle level of world power there  exist vast quantities of sophisticated, so called  conventional weapons.  Indeed we  have  seen  some of  them  in devastating  action this very year. These weapons are, by  comparison with those of former times, im mensely destructive, and they are actually  being used. They are also the objects of a  highly profitable international trade.  At yet another level we have the poverty  of a vast proportion of the world's popula tion-a deprivation  inexplicable  in  terms  either of  available  resources  or of  the  money and ingenuity spent on armaments  and war. We have unsolved but soluble  problems of economic relations, trade, dis8499  tribution of resources and technology. We  have many ideas and plans as  to how to  meet the growing needs of the large mass of  humanity, but somehow such human con siderations seem to take second place to the  technology and funding of violence and war  in the name of national security.  It is for these reasons that our peoples, es pecially the young,  take to the streets in  their hundreds of thousands in many parts  of the world to proclaim their peaceful pro test against the existing situation and their  deep fear of the consequences of the arms  race and nuclear catastrophe. Who can say  that these gentle protesters are wrong or  misguided? On the contrary, they recall us  to the standards and the duties which we  set ourselves in the Charter of the United  Nations. The States Members of this Orga nization should not ignore the significance  of what they are trying to say.  What in reality is the role and the capac ity of the United Nations in such a world?  Our Charter was born of six years of global  agony and destruction.  I  sometimes  feel  that we now take the Charter far less seri ously than did its authors, living as they did  in the wake of a world tragedy. I believe  therefore that an important first step would  be a conscious recominitment by Govern ments to the Charter.  Certainly we have strayed far from the  Charter in recent years. Governments that  believe they can win an international objec tive by force are often quite ready to do so,  and domestic opinion not infrequently ap plauds such a course. The Security Council,  the primary organ of the United Nations for  the maintenance of international peace and  security, all too often finds itself unable to  take decisive action to resolve international  conflicts and its resolutions are increasingly  defied or ignored by those that feel them selves strong enough to do so. Too frequent ly the Council seems powerless to generate  the support and influence to ensure that its  decisions are respected, even when these are  taken unanimously. Thus  the process of  peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed  in the Charter is often brushed aside. Stern er measures for world peace were envisaged  in Chapter VII of the Charter, which was  conceived as a key element of the United  Nations system of collective security, but  the prospect of realizing such measures is  now deemed almost impossible in our divid ed international community. We are peril ously near to a new international anarchy.  I believe that we are at present embarked  on an exceedingly dangerous course, one  symptom of which is the crisis in the multi lateral approach in international affairs and  the concomitant erosion of the authority  and status of world and regional intergov ernmental institutions. Above all, this trend  has adversely affected the United Nations,  the instrument that was created specifically  to prevent such a  self-destructive course.  Such a trend must be reversed before once  again we bring upon ourselves a global ca tastrophe and find ourselves without insti tutions effective enough to prevent it.  While I do not propose here to review in  detail specific situations and developments,  it is, of course, my deep concern about them  that leads me to examine the underlying de ficiencies of our present system. The trage dy of Lebanon and the imperative need to  resolve the problem of the Middle East in  all its aspects, including the legitimate right  of the Palestinians and the security of all  States in the region; the war between Iran  and Iraq; the political situation relating to  Afghanistan;  the prevailing convulsion of  ",1983
381,272,7,Mr. SHANNON.," Mr. Speaker, on  March 16, 1983, the Foreign Minister  for the Republic of Ireland, Mr. Peter  Barry, delivered a major address at  the National Press Club.  In his re marks, he outlined the Irish Govern ment's views on  the continuing vio lence in the north and he presented a  proposal for a ""Forum for a New Ire land,""  to which political parties  in  Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ire land, and the United Kingdom will be  invited. In assessing the campaign of  violence, Mr. Barry was explicit in his  message to the purveyors of violence  in Northern Ireland and to those in  this country who support the violence  as a means to an end. I commend his  message, and through him that of the  Irish people, to my colleagues.  TExT OF SPEECH DELIVERED BY THE MINISTER  FOR  FOREIGN  .AFFAIRS  OF  PETER BARRY, T.D., TO THE NATIONAL PREss  CLUB, MARCH 16, 1983  IRELAND, MR.  Early in the last century an Irish exile in  the United States wrote to a friend in Ire land in the following terms:  ""America is not what you saw it, nor what  even your sanguine mind could anticipate; it  ha.S  shot up  in strength and prosperity  beyond the most visionary calculation. It  has great destinies, and I have no doubt,  will  ameliorate  the  condition  of man  throughout the world.""  The writer of  these  lines was Thomas  Addis Emmet, brother of the Irish patriot  Robert Emmet. His words, written when the  United States were just two generations old,  are strikingly perceptive. They are also typi cal"" of  the  faith and commitment which  countless Irish people before and after him  brought to this, their country of adoption.  Their energy, courage and skills contributed  much to  translating  into reality Emmet's  prophetic vision of the future greatness of  the United States. Today their descendants  immi are to be found in the highest offices of the  land and in every field of endeavour. Their  presence here constitutes a special bond be tween Ireland and the United States and  gives a special dimension to the relationship  between the two countries. From the very  beginning,  that relationship  is one which  has enriched both countries. As one histori an has written: ""An Irishman was among  the five who died in the Boston Massacre,  and eight signers of the Declaration of Inde pendence,  the secretary of Congress who  certified it, the officer who first read it to a  public gathering, and even the printer who  turned out the first copies were all Irish. born or  the descendants of  Irish  grants.""  If the Irish contributed significantly  to  the  establishment  of  this  nation,  the  achievements and the concern of the Irish  in  the United States were  a  source of  strength and encouragement to people  in  Ireland in times of difficulty and despond ency. The energies and  the capacity  for  hard work of the Irish people helped to lay  the first foundations of the prosperity of  the United States. Today the performance  of American corporations who generate em ployment  and  exports  in  Ireland  are  a  valued element in our  industrial develop ment. Our overall record of economic devel opment since independence has been a very  positive one. The average  Irish family  is  now three times better off than when the  State was  founded. Yet, as a small open  economy, Ireland has felt in full measure  the chill of the current world recession. The  Irish Government has taken the necessary  steps to ensure the future health of our  economy. We are determined to protect the  basis of our economic growth. Our current  difficulties can and will be overcome. They  are nevertheless real and painful. They add  to the importance for us of our economic  partnership with the United States. That  partnership is again one of mutual benefit.  The 350 U.S. corporations manufacturing in  Ireland enjoy  the benefits of a generous  system of incentives, access to the European  market, a consistent industrial policy and an  educated and highly motivated work force.  In spite of the climate of recession the aver age rate of return on investment in Ireland  by U.S. corporations is 31 percent. For us in  Ireland that partnership provides employ ment opportunities which are particularly  important because of our young and grow ing population. They are particularly appre ciated  in  a  country where  the painful  memory of widespread emigration is all too  recent.  My presence here in the United States on  this St. Patrick's Day is  to celebrate the  bonds of friendship between Ireland and the  United States-countries so different in his tory and scale, yet so akin in many of the  fundamental  values which  their peoples  hold dear. It is also to share with you our  concern on a problem which touches all of  us deeply, as it must touch all who have the  welfare of Ireland at heart. The continuing  and unresolved tragedy of Northern Ireland  casts a shadow over our celebration of the  joyful feast of the patron saint of Ireland.  Our many  friends  in  the United States  share our anguish at what  is happening.  They ask us: how has  this  tragedy come  about? Can it be resolved? Are there ways in  which we can help? Here on a day when in terest is focused on Ireland and in the cap ital city of a people whose sympathy and in terest in Ireland has been a cherished part  of our relationship, I would like to try to  answer those questions.  The Northern Ireland problem is a prod uct of the long and complex history of the  relationship between Britain and Ireland.  Its most recent manifestation arises from  the attempt made by Great Britain some  sixty years ago to resolve the problem of di vision of Irish opinion on the basis of a divi sion of Irish territory. It aimed to protect  the unionist minority in Ireland by creating  the new entity of Northern Ireland in which  the unionist community was ensured a local  majority. However,  that measure went  beyond the protection of a minority. To the  extent that it did so it sowed the seeds of in stability. It created a new minority-the na tionalist  population which  found  itself  dominated by the permanent unionist ma jority of Northern Ireland. Each of the two  communities in Northern Ireland is deter mined to avoid permanent minority status whether as a nationalist minority in North ern Ireland or a unionist minority in Ireland  as a whole. It is that which gives the con flict its particular bitterness.  Nationalist opinion in Ireland opposed the  partition of  Ireland. It believes  that the  elimination of division between  the  two  parts of Ireland is an important goal. But  there are two sharply different perceptions  of how this can be attained. There are two  fundamentally divergent approaches to the  problem of ending the division between the  two Irish traditions which partition cast in  territorial form.  In recent years in Ireland we have seen  the effect of a destructive approach which  has systematically attacked the links which  tie North and South together. It has done  so on the level of physical infrastructure. It  has done so in relation to the personal and  commercial relations which draw people of  the two parts of Ireland together. That is  the approach of the IRA. There is the con structive approach which seeks to hold on  to  the bonds between North and South  which already exist in many fields of endea vour. That is the policy of the Irish Govern ment.  There is a form of nationalism that has  been frozen or warped by the burden of past  history. It is so vengeful and narrow as to be  rejected by the great majority of nationalist  people living in Ireland, not to speak of the  unionist community. That is the outlook of  the IRA. There is a spirit of Irish national ism which is generous and forward-looking.  It seeks to accommodate the basic concerns  of all the people living on the island of Ire land in a spirit of reconciliation and harmo ny. That is the philosophy of the Irish Gov ernment and  the majority of  the  Irish  people.  There is an approach which invokes the  rhetoric of Irish unity to justify a campaign  of violence  in N orthem Ireland which  is  tribal and sectarian  in practice. A recent  survey showed that in Northern Ireland one  Protestant in four now has personal experi ence of the killing or serious injury of a rel ative or personal friend. The victims are  most often gunned down while about their  daily business-a police officer murdered in  sight of the children he was helping across  the road, a postman shot delivering a letter  which had been mailed to lure him to an  isolated farmhouse, a bible teacher killed in  front of his class, a school bus driver mur dered  in  the presence of his passengers.  These are recent additions to a long litany  of victims. Each and every such atrocity  gives  fresh  intensity  to  the  fears  and  hatreds which-on  anyone's definition must be dismantled  if  Irish unity  is  to  become a reality.

382,285,7,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, six mem bers of the House Ways and Means'  Subcommittee on Trade recently trav eled to Japan to meet with officials of  the Japanese Government. We went to  Japan as  legislators, not diplomats,  and while our delegation did not cause  an earthquake, we did send tremors  through Japanese Government and in dustrial  circles. Our message was  simple and direct: ""Trade must be a  two-way street.""  This is the topic that I addressed in  my most  recent weekly  newspaper  column. It follows.  WASHINGTON REPORT  <By Don J. Pease, U.S. Congressman, 13th  District>  No  earthquake was  registered, but  the  House Ways and Means Committee's Trade  Subcommittee definitely caused some rum bles in Japan during a series of Easter week  meetings with Japanese officials.  In meeting after meeting, the six-member  delegation of which I was a part pounded  away at the Japanese government for keep ing American products out of Japan while  helping their companies penetrate the U.S.  market.  We six congressmen went to Japan as leg islators, not diplomats,  and we  saw  no  reason for diplomatic pussy-footing around  the issues.  ""The political consensus for free trade has  been destroyed in America largely because  of  resentment of Japan,""  thundered one  member of our delegation to Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone.  In a heated discussion with Japanese For eign Minister Shintaro Abe, one of our  Trade Subcommittee members was fuming:  ""I've listened to your excuses about autos,  and I don't buy them. I've listened for 15  years to your excuses on oranges and beef  restrictions, and I don't buy them.""  The Japanese were well aware of my role  as a principal sponsor in the Congress of the  automobile  domestic  content  bill which  would require cars sold in the United States  to have a high content of U.S.-made parts.  The bill's passage in the House of RepreEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  sentatives last year and its reintroduction  this year have the Japanese scrambling to  ease some of their barriers to U.S. products  going into Japan.  Thus, the Japanese were not surprised at  my insistence that U.S. autos should be able  to enter the Japanese market as freely as  Japanese cars enter our country. But Japa nese officials were impressed by the strong  support I got from Sam Gibbons, D-Florida,  chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, and  other members of our delegation who had  opposed the domestic content bill.  Referring to political pressures building in  the United States, one member said, ""I'm a  free  trader with no apologies, but we're  about to be overwhelmed.""  The Japanese were also impressed when  two other congressmen from non-automo bile areas joined me in pressing for a fourth  year of voluntary restraint on the part of  Japanese automakers exporting cars to the  United States.  All in all, I felt it was a great team effort  on the part of our six-member delegation in  dealing with not only auto, orange, beef and  cigarette  restrictions, but also with vital  broader issues like Japanese targetting of  U.S.  industries and the undervaluation of  the yen <which makes Japanese cars 20 per cent cheaper in the United States than they  would be if the yen were properly valued>.  Most importantly, we got to deliver our  strong message to absolutely the top people  in Japan. In addition to the prime minister  and foreign minister we had long meetings  with the chief cabinet minister, with the  minister of finance, with  the minister of  trade, with leaders of the ruling political  party in Japan, and with the presidents of  all of the auto manufacturers in Japan.  Nor did we  forget  the public. In a 75minute press conference for Japanese and  American reporters, the same points were  emphasized. The next day, all of the major  Japanese  newspapers  carried  prominent  news stories.  As I say, our Trade Subcommittee delega tion didn't cause an earthquake, but we did  send a few  tremors reverberating through  Japanese government and industrial circles.  The messages: ""Trade must be a  two-way  street.""e  MARY DETERT-CYCLING  AGAINST CANCER '83  HON. JOHN HILER  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983   ",1983
383,285,7,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Speaker, William  Arthur Ward once spoke of achieving  the impossible.  If we can imagine, he said, we can  achieve. If we can dream, we can make  it real.  Mrs. Mary Detert, a South Bend citi zen, is trying to prove that Mr. Ward  was correct. She  is chairman of an  event that is being held on May 1,  ""Cycling Against Cancer '83."" She is  spearheading  this 8-mile bike-a-thon  in an effort to raise funds for St. Jude  Childrens Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,  her contribution in the effort to fight  leukemia.  The reasons that she is so involved  in this effort are personal. Her sister  8525  died of  this dreaded disease at  the  young age of 16. Mary was so moved  by her battle for life that she has dedi cated herself to help others in their  own personal wars against leukemia.  Mr. Speaker, Mary Detert is one of  the everyday heroines of our society.  Her only reward is that she may be  able,  through her own efforts and  leadership,  to  help  raise  enough  money that might just lead to a cure  for this disease.  Mary Detert is one of the reasons  that despite  the recession  last year,  charitable  contributions  increased.  She is one of the reasons that Ameri cans are known as one of the most  compassionate peoples on this Earth.  She holds no illusions about her ef forts. She knows that leukemia is a  difficult and ominous enemy, particu larly of children. But she believes in  miracles, and I am confident that her  efforts will not go unrewarded. Her ef forts and the efforts of hundreds like  her are our best hope in the effort to  cure many of our Nation's ills.  I know St. Jude Childrens Hospital  appreciates her efforts, and I urge all  my colleagues to join me in honoring  Mary Detert  for  her unselfish  ef forts.e  ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT  AND  INDUSTRIAL REVITALIZA TION ACT OF 1983  HON.HENRYJ.NOWAK  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983   ",1983
384,285,7,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker, our Na tion's older cities are facing the pros pect of long-term economic deteriora tion. The demise of our country's in dustrial base, persistently high unem ployment and the plight of our dis placed workers are dramatic symbols  of the grim problems encountered by  these urban centers.  In light of these serious economic  problems, on March 23, 1983, I intro duced  the Enterprise Development  and  Industrial Revitalization Act of  1983. This act is a refined version of  the Enterprise Development Act of  1981, as well as being an active  re sponse to the recommendations of the  report on job creation and the revital ization of small business released by  my Subcommittee on Tax, Access  to  Equity Capital and Business Opportu nities.  These  investigations  reemphasized  the  importance of  targeting aid  to  small-and medium-sized businesses in  distressed areas, particularly  in our  older urban centers. This development  process  encompasses  procedures  to  insure a viable infrastructure base, up front  incentives  for  investment  plant and equipment and for working  capital.  in  ",1983

387,311,7,Mr.  LUNGREN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would also  like to thank the gentle man from Georgia <Mr. LEviTAS) and  the gentleman from Georgia <Mr. GIN RICH)  for  their efforts yesterday  in  what I thought was a very intriguing  and a very positive approach. The one  thing I would like to make reference  to, however, was some comments made  by  the majority leader just prior to  the vote on that amendment, because  I think that some confusion arose and  I think we ought to address it.  In quoting the majority leader, he  said this concerning the resolution, as  he  argued  against  accepting  the  amendment of  the gentleman  from  Georgia:  It is a simple proposition that we face. It  is not complicated. The question is, do we  favor a mutual and verifiable freeze andre duction of nuclear weapons? There is noth ing complicated about that, nothing sinister  about that, nothing hidden about it.  Then he goes on to say this:  So it seems to me that we need to uncom plicate  the matter. Let us keep  it clear,  simple  and  straightforward. We  should  not-! repeat-not try to get into the techni cal questions of what comes first-freeze or  reduction, qualitative or quantitative limita tions, delivery systems or warheads. Leave  those  to  the negotiators as properly we  should.  The reason I bring those comments  up is, it seems to me that they could  have been used by  those who were  supporting the proposition of the gen tleman from Georgia, they could have  been used by the people who were sup porting the proposition of the gentle man from Michigan <Mr. SILJANDER),  they could have and should have been  used, in my judgment, to support the  proposition of  the gentleman  from  Colorado <Mr. BROWN), all of whom  were trying to point out that we ought  to have more than one option, that if  we can reduce first rather than freeze  first, we ought to do that. I thought  that was one of the elements of the  gentleman's proposition yesterday.  I  know it was from the gentleman from  Michigan <Mr. SILJANDER) and certain ly the gentleman from Colorado.  I  think what  the gentleman from  Georgia mentioned a minute ago is ex tremely important. Much of the rheto ric that has been heard in these Halls  is confusing. And it ought not to be  the question of whether you are for  peace or against peace, whether you  want to reduce weapons or you do not  want to reduce weapons. It ought to  be: How do we get together in working  with the legislative branch and with  the executive branch so that we put  forward the most effective proposal to  engage the Soviet Union in this exer cise, because we all know we cannot do  it unilaterally.  D 1130  I would hope that perhaps the gen tleman might bring his amendment up  next time and maybe we could call it  the majority leader's amendment and  cite  the majority  leader's comments  and perhaps we might get those few  votes necessary to pass it.  I thank the gentleman from Georgia  for his indulgence.  THE LIBERAL FOREIGN POLICY  IS PROSLA VERY  ",1983

389,311,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I am  going to talk today about the reality  which came into focus this week about  liberal foreign policy and its indiffer ence to slavery and its indifference to  issues of the survival of freedom on  this planet.  We have had  three  incidents  this  week that I think are extraordinarily  revealing. One was the leader of the  Democratic Party in the House saying  that allowing a 19-year-old girl to stay  in America was unwise when her alter native was slavery. The second was a  series of votes in the Committee on  Foreign Affairs whose net effect is to  say that if you are for freedom in Cen tral America, we will not help you, and  if you are against freedom in Central  America, we will not stop you, and  then an additional series of votes in  the Committee on Foreign Affairs in  which  they  applied  that  to North  Africa as well, saying in effect to our  friends  in Morocco and Zaire and in  Tunisia that your military problems,  the reality of foreign aggression, the  reality of the Polisario guerrillas, the  reality of being next door to Libya and  the dictator  the  reality  of  having  Cuban  and Soviet-trained guerrillas  training  against Zaire  is  irrelevant;  your freedom and your survival does  not matter to us.  Finally,  a  debate on  the nuclear  freeze resolution, whose sophistry and  lack of realism was breathtaking at  best and stunning at worst.  Let me start first with the case of  Hu Na, the young lady who  is a 19year-old tennis player who decided she  did not want to go home. It raises a  fundamental issue, and I think a fun damental problem for America, a prob lem which was raised in larger num bers by  the boat people, a problem  which has been raised for us again and  again since World War II.  In Abraham  Lincoln's phrase,  a  house cannot stand half free and half  slave. That may be true of the world.  The  long-run  consequence  of  our  giving in, of our withdrawing, of our  pulling out, of our pulling back, of our  isolationism, of the increasing cry for  what  is  in  effect  unilateral  disar mament,  the consequence has been  that free Vietnamese now live in Los  Angeles or in Washington, they do not  live in Saigon; that free Cambodians  now live in Atlanta or Detroit, they do  not live any longer in Cambodia; that  free Laotians live literally in my dis trict in Clayton County; they sadly no  longer live in Laos.  That  is a  reality. That happened.  Free Cubans live in Florida, in Atlan ta; they do not live in Cuba.  Now, we have two choices. We can  become a Byzantine empire surviving  against a  hostile world, closing our  borders, crushing resistance when  it  comes near us, and paying the cost for  that survival, or we can resurrect the  flag of freedom and say that freedom  is worth fighting for, that freedom is  worth helping, that freedom is a noble  cause,  that  freedom  is worth  the  effort.  This week, after, I am sure, an ac ceptable and interesting and exciting  visit to China, the leader of the Demo cratic Party  in  this House  said,  in  what I think is the first time since the  Dred Scott decision in the 1850's, that  ",1983
390,350,7,Mr. NUNN.,"  In my  judgment, Dr.  Adelman has demonstrated in his writ ings, his testimony for the most part,  and his experience that he is a bright,  capable individual.  Were  this debate occurring at the  beginning of the Reagan administra tion, I have no doubt that Dr. Adel man would  be  confirmed  by  the  Senate with  little  controversy  and  would be in a position to make a real  contribution  to  the administration's  arms control policies. That is obvious ly not the case today.  While Dr. Adelman has the requisite  capabilities to do a good job at ACDA  under  normal  circumstances,  these  times are not normal.  In my mind,  then, the issue is not really Dr. Adel man's integrity or his capabilities. The  issue is the long-term best interests of  this country in the arms control arena.  There  is a growing focus, both  in  this country and abroad, of the need  to move arms control to the front and  center in the search for peace and sta bility. There is a growing pressure and  impatience for some signs of progress  and  continuity.  In  fairness,  the  Reagan administration has put  for ward several sound proposals in this  area. From the outset of this adminis tration, however, the path to progress  has been  littered with unwarranted  and  unneeded  rhetoric which  has  caused considerable controversy and  confusion both  in  this country and  abroad. For  every  step  forward  it  seems we take two steps backward.  Arms control in 1983  is one of our  most important foreign policy objec tives. More than ever before, other im portant foreign policy and national se curity goals are intertwined with our  arms  control proposals. Progress  in  this area, which is essential to many of  our national security objectives, de pends on the European citizenry, as  well as our own, believing  that this  country's leadership  is serious about  arms control. If the European public is  not convinced, then the European po litical leaders are going to have diffi culty deploying . the Pershing II and  ground launched cruise missiles. If the  Soviets perceive that NATO will not  deploy those missiles, there will not be  an  intermediate range nuclear force  agreement. If we do not reach an INF  agreement, the prospects for START  diminish considerably. We are  in a  battle for the hearts and minds of the  European public as well as the Ameri can public. It is  important that our  friends  and our  adversaries  believe  that U.S. arms control policies have  broad bipartisan support with continu ity from administration to administra tion. The Adelman nomination and  this debate certainly does not encour age that belief.  I would have preferred that Presi dent Reagan withdraw Dr. Adelman's  nomination without  prejudice  and  nominate someone who would enjoy a  broad bipartisan  consensus. Despite  his  impressive general qualifications,  Dr. Adelman has admitted that he is  not a recognized expert with interna tional standing  in  the arms control  field. The President, however, as is his  prerogative, has not withdrawn  this  nomination, and  the Senate  is now  faced with deciding between two unde sirable choices: Confirming or defeat ing the nomination by a small margin.  In my view, our Nation loses either  way.  Mr. President, I am convinced that  there will be no success in arms con trol unless the Soviets are firmly con vinced that U.S. arms control policies  have continuity and strong bipartisan  support  and will  not  significantly  change  in  1985 whether President  Reagan is  in office or not. This is a  major challenge for  the Reagan ad ministration during the remainder of  this term.  In my judgment, the Adelman nomi nation is a move away from this essen tial national goal.  I will,  therefore,  vote ""no"" on this confirmation.  Whatever  the outcome of  today's  vote, it is imperative that both the ad ministration and Congress begin to ap proach our national security and arms  control policies on a bipartisan basis.  Unless this is done, there will be little  chance of providing continuity in our  arms control efforts.  Mr. President, I yield back the re mainder of my  time  to  the Senator  from Rhode Island.

393,350,7,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my friend, the ranking member on the  Foreign Relations Committee.  Mr. President, I have been agonizing  over this vote for a long time. Unfortu nately, I have been tied up the last  few days with the night-and-day ses sions in the Senate Budget Committee  and therefore have not been able to be  on the floor to the extent that I would  have liked to listen to the debate to  try and help  inform me on how  I  should vote on this nomination.  As I said when I was on the floor a  couple of days ago and had a chance  to listen to some of the debate then,  during that time I became involved in  the debate and I said I felt that prob ably this was the most important vote  or one of the most  important votes  ",1983
394,376,7,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I think  it is a sad day for America that Ken neth Adelman's nomination was con firmed by the Senate. Now that he is  in this position, the only way we can  remove  him  is  by  removing Mr.  Reagan  from  the Presidency.  I  am  very much of the opinion that in 1984  our Nation, for a variety of reasons,  will take that step and we will in fact  elect a new President. In so doing, we  will not only put the Presidency into  new  and more  capable  hands  but  afford ourselves  the chance  to  then  select on behalf of our Nation some one to head the arms control effort  who brings the qualification and the  professional standing and the aware ness of the issues that this vital, abso lutely critical issue requires.  In a sense, I suppose the confirma tion today draws the issue even more  clearly, and that is the problem of a  lack of movement on arms control and  in the end is a problem of inadequate  Presidential leadership.  I think it is time for us now to deal  with  the  problem-of  President  Reagan; when this term is up, to re place him with a President that can  perform this job at a higher standard  and in a much better way.  ",1983
395,376,7,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I never  made any statement  to  the Senate  prior to the vote on the nomination  today. I thought that was a bipartisan  matter, and I felt that had I spoken  against  the nomination,  it might be  viewed as a partisan issue. I feel that a  thing or two should be said, however.  As I read the Constitution, article II,  section 2, paragraph 2, it is as follows:  HeMeaning the Presidentshall have Power, by and with the Advice  and Consent of the Senate, to make Trea ties, provided  two-thirds of  the Senators  present concur; and he shall nominate, and  by and with the Advice and Consent of the  Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other  public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the  supreme Court, and all other Officers of the  United States, whose Appointments are not  herein otherwise provided for, and which  shall be established by law ...  I do not read the Constitution, Mr.  President, as saying that the Senate  has to rubberstamp every nominee or  any nominee of any President, of any  party. Over the years, T have heard  the argument made many times to the  effect that, ""Well, it's the President's  nominee. He should have whomever  he wishes.""  That is not with what the Constitu tion says. Each of us takes an oath, as  we begin our holding of this office as a  United States Senator, to uphold the  Constitution.  I simply wish to say for the record  that this is one Senator who will never  subscribe to the view that any Presi dent-this  President,  a Democratic  President or a Republican President is entitled automatically to have his  choice as nominee for any office.  I do not say that that is not a factor  in my thinking when I approach my  vote on a nomination. It is a  factor  and has some degree of validity, but it  should not be the overriding factor;  because if it is the overriding factor,  the Constitution might as well be ex purgated of the words I have just read,  which should be taken out of the Con stitution. That can be done only by a  constitutional amendment.  Our Founding Fathers were  con cerned about extending a President  such  inordinate power. They  feared  that giving a President such unfet tered power would allow him to place  in office any person of his choice, no  matter how unqualified or how incom petent, to conduct the important busi ness of our Government. They were  concerned that this would accord  to  the President  the  very monarchial  powers against which our Founding  Fathers rebelled.  History indicates that the framers of  the Constitution intended that respon sibility for foreign policy be shared be tween Congress and the President. In  this connection,  the Senate was ac corded a special advisory role under  the Constitution.  I  think we make a mockery of the  role for the Senate that is written into  the Constitution,  by  simply  voting  automatically for a nominee once the  nomination comes up.  The requirement that ambassadors,  ministers, and consuls be subject  to  Senate confirmation appears to have  been intended as a basic part of the di vision of foreign relations powers be tween Congress  and  the President.  The power-sharing was structured in  this manner as  recognition that the  Senate also had a special advisory role  in the treaty making processes of our  Government. Therefore, it was logical  to our Founding Fathers that there  was a  connection between  requiring  the advice and consent of the Senate  in the making of treaties and requiring  the advice and consent of the Senate  for the appointment of representatives  of our Government  responsible  for  and  the  overseeing  treaty  negotiations  those who would participate  in  actual negotiations themselves.  The requirement for Senate confir mation of nominees also serves  the  purpose of keeping up the caliber of  appointees by providing a check on  the choices and an opportunity  for  scrutiny. In the foreign affairs field, it  provides a means for  the Senate to  assure that the United States is ably  represented. It also provides a channel  of communications between Senators  and executive branch officials on the  problems and goals of U.S.  foreign  policy. And finally, the hearings and  nominations are a method of oversee ing  the  administration  of  foreign  policy by the executive branch.  So if we subscribe to the notion that  a President should have whomever he  wishes, why should he even send the  name up to the Senate? Why should  the appropriate committee that may  have jurisdiction over the nomination  bother to have hearings? If it is an  automatic thing, committees are wast ing their time, the Senate is wasting  its time debating the nominations, and  the President is wasting his  time in  bothering to send the nomination up  to the Senate.  I certainly do not find any reason to  criticize any Senator for voting one  way or the other on nominations, as  we saw today.  I voted against the nomination for  various reasons, one of which was that  the President stated publicly that ""If  they could not see the light up there,  they would feel the heat."" I resented  that statement. It is not a matter of  feeling the heat. It is a matter of ful filling our constitutional duties, and  they  are  clear-that  the President  shall appoint, by and with the advice  and consent of the Senate.  I was offended, on behalf of this in stitution,  that  the President made  that statement. I hope that no future  President-or  this  one,  either-will  make such a statement again.  I can  understand his doing everything he  can in favor of a person nominated by  him, and I can understand his contacts  with Senators in his efforts to get a  nominee confirmed. I have no objec tion  to  that. But  to make a public  statement that ""If they cannot see the  light, they can feel the heat,"" leaves  me cold-cold. I am talking about ab solute zero when I say ""cold,"" absolute  zero being minus 459 degrees Fahren heit.  I do not subscribe to that kind of  public statement, nor do I subscribe to  the idea that this Senate, under this  Constitution that I have here in my  hand,  should automatically  confirm  any nominee that any President sends  up for any position. We cannot give  any President just any old nomination  he wants just because he is President;  it is the responsibility of the Senate to  ",1983
396,389,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, with all  of  the controversy surrounding  the  MX missile,  particularly with  the  recent  release of  the  report of  the  President's Commission on Strategic  Forces, a great deal of attention has  settled upon  the use of  the  small  ICBM, known in some circles as the  Midgetman. In discussion with some of  my colleagues, and reading their state ments both in the RECORD and in the  media,  I  have witnessed  a  trend  toward supporting the small ICBM in  lieu of the MX.  I want to caution anyone who sup poses that this will be a quick and in expensive venture; nothing could be  further from the truth. Development  of a small ICBM will take both time  and money. In an article appearing in  the Washington Post  this morning,  ""Small Missiles Carries Problems of  Its Own,"" by Michael Getler, many of  the problems attendant to moving in  this direction are identified.  Among  the  problems  listed  are:  First, military and industry sources in dicate development time for the entire  system to be up to 10 years; second,  the cost of such a system could be as  high as $69 billion. ""Don't forget,"" one  officer said, ""1,000 single warhead mis siles means 1,000 guidance  systems,  1,000  transporters,  1,000  a  lot  of  things."";  third, estimates are that it  could take up to 47,000 personnel to  operate the system; fourth, questions  remain about guidance systems; and  fifth, there is currently no vehicle ca pable of performing the mission being  identified for the small missile trans fer-launcher.  These problems were further high lighted by comments contributed  to  former Secretary of Defense Harold  Brown. According to Secretary Brown,  ""This new system still has many un certainties, particularly  in  terms of  cost and the feasibility of hardening  truck-mobile missiles or superharden ing of fixed shelters.""  Mr. President, these are only a few  of the problems that must be resolved  before we can say this is the system we  will use. What must be understood is  that this is not an alternative to the  MX. The MX remains a vital part of  our national security.  As we go forward with this problem,  and as we  consider both  the Presi dent's recommended basing mode and  the defense spending bill, it behooves  all of us to keep an open mind to the  options available to us. One of these is  the small ICBM, but is will require a  great deal of work. In the meantime,  we should proceed with  the deploy ment of MX. I point out to my col leagues  that  in  the Commission's  report these options were laid out as a  package and not in a manner in which  they would pick and choose those op tions which we seem more attracted to  as opposed to others. Mr. President, I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  above-mentioned article be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 19831  SMALL MISSILE CARRIES PROBLEMS OF ITS  OWN  <By Michael Getler)  The small, single-warhead nuclear missile  that the president's advisory commission on  arms recommended this week as a possible  successor to the MX would solve some probit would  faces. But  lems  the Pentagon  create some new ones.  Among other things, it might cost more  than twice as much as the MX, some ex perts estimate. One reason is that it might  require as many as 47,000 people  just to  tend a  sizeable small-missile force of the  kind now envisioned.  One  important advantage of small mis siles, supporters say, is that they make less  attractive targets than large ones like the  multiple-warhead MX. If the United States  and Soviet Union shifted to smaller missiles  there would be less temptation for either  side to strike first in a nuclear war in hopes  of  knocking out  the  other's  retaliatory  power.  Supporters also argue that the small Inis sile-30 tons vs. 100 for the MX-would be  relatively easy to move around or otherwise  protect. The likelier U.S. missiles are to sur vive an attack,  the more deterrent value  they have.  Whether a small Inissile of the kind envi sioned can be built is not in doubt. It is a  relatively easy job.  But how it might be transported and pro tected from the blasts of even distant nucle ar explosions, how much it would cost, how  many would be needed and how many per sons  it would  take  to operate and guard  such a system are very big question marks.  In addition, it is not clear that all the im portant elements of  the U.S. Air Force,  which would be charged with developing the  missile, are unified behind the idea.  Some Air Force estimates submitted  to  the presidential commission, according  to  military and industry sources, forecast costs  of $69 billion over 10  years  to develop,  deploy and operate a force of about 1,000  such missiles on mobile transporters special ly designed to withstand nuclear blast, heat  and radiation.  ""Don't forget,"" one officer said,  ""1,000  single-warhead missiles means 1,000 guid ance systems, 1,000 transporters, 1,000 a lot  of things.""  The Air Force says its small-missile cost  estimate compares with roughly $30 billion  over the same period to deploy 100 MX mis siles, with a  total of 1,000  individual war heads on them, in the Dense Pack basing  system that was rejected by Congress but  which the Air Force said it believed offered  a good chance for survival.  In addition, some estimates indicate that  it could take 47,000 personnel to operate,  maintain and guard these weapons, with the  security requirements especially high if pro visions are made to move the mobile launch ers off military reservations and onto the  nation's road system during exercises or pe riods of alert or crisis.  Industrial experts, who also asked not to  be identified, say they believe the military  estimates are far too high. For one thing,  they say it. is not likely that 1,000 missiles  will be needed because they will be more  survivable than MXs in fixed silos. One con tractor estimated that even if a 1,000-Inissile  force on protective vehicles were needed it  could be done for $30 billion to $40 billion  over 10 years.  There are also military concerns about  whether  the  small missile would  have  enough power to carry a big enough war head to knock out Soviet missile silos and  command bunkers  if  the Soviets  increase  the strength of such underground installa tions.  Another question is whether a sufficiently  accurate guidance system could be devel oped to steer the missile to its target after  ",1983
397,402,7,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent,  I am pleased  to  join Senator  RoTH and others to introduce this leg islation, which would add  two new  members to the Advisory Commission  on Intergovernmental Relations, one  representing towns and township governments and one representing local  elected school boards.  Although a bill is  just being intro duced  today,  this  issue has already  generated considerable legislative his tory. In the 97th Congress my Sub committee on Intergovernmental Re lations held 2 days of hearings on the  structure and activities of  the Com mission. We came close to passing leg islation which would have added mem bers at the end of the last Congress.  I believe that the legislation being  introduced by Senator RoTH  reflects  the principles that were developed in  the hearings and debate  last year.  Many organizations have understand ably sought membership on ACIR. In  judging  those claims we must keep  three principles  in mind. First, we  should seek balance  in the member ship across all three levels of govern ment. The  current membership  in cludes nine Federal officials,  seven  State officials,  seven  local officials,  and  three  private  citizens. Senator  RoTH's bill would add two local offi cials, which  I  do not  think would  greatly disturb the balance which we  seek.  Second, Acm is designed to repre sent the views of elected officials of  general purpose governments. I have  in the past expressed concern about  adding school board members because  it moves away from  this principle. I  agree to one additional member repre senting school boards because educa tion is such a large and important ele ment of local government. I can see  the advantage of this addition,  if it  brings school boards into the circle of  public  interest  groups  representing  elected officials who work actively to  strengthen our Federal partnership.  Third, we should seek to maintain a  relatively small Commission represent ing  the  principal  general  purpose  elected officials at the State and local  level. The  personal  interaction  be tween Commissioners at the quarterly  ACIR meetings is an important factor  in developing the understanding that  has made the Commission so success ful  in  the past. Congressman L. H.  Fountain, father of ACIR, who only  retired from Congress last year, often  mentioned the importance of keeping  the Commission to a size that promot ed  effective  interaction  among  the  members. His  observation  on  this  point, developed over 20 years as a  member of  the Commission,  should  carry great weight in our decisions on  the future of the Commission.  One final note, Mr. President. I am  particularly pleased that the legisla tion introduced by Senator RoTH will  add  one  full member  representing  towns and townships. In the past, the  voice of small governments has not  been well-represented on the Commis sion. The concerns of small communi ties are very different from those of  our large and urban cities and counties. In the last Congress, I sponsored  legislation  to  add  three  town  and  township officials to correct this im balance.  I know  that the  town and  township officials of this Nation will  be pleased  that Senator RoTH's bill  moves in this direction.  As the chairman has indicated, we  expect early action in the Governmen tal Affairs Committee on this bill. And  once again, I would like to thank the  chairman, Senator RoTH, for his lead ership on a knotty and difficult issue.e  e ",1983
398,402,7,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  join Senators RoTH  and  DURENBERGER and others in reintroduc ing legislation to expand the member ship of the prestigious Advisory Com mission on  Intergovernmental Rela tions <ACIR) for the first time since  its creation in 1959. This bill brings  the ACIR into the present by modify ing its composition to more adequately  reflect the federal system of today.  Our bill expands the ACIR from 26  to 28 members by adding one elected  school board member and one town ship official. I am particularly pleased  at the inclusion of the school board of ficial because it reflects the intent of  the bill I introduced in the last Con gress, S. 2338,  to add  three elected  school board members to the ACIR.  Mr. President, the ACIR was estab lished  to bring  together  representa tives of the Federal, State, and local  governments  to  consider  common  problems and work out solutions that  are agreeable to all levels of govern ment. The Congress also charged the  ACIR with providing a forum for dis cussing the administration and coordi nation of Federal grant programs re quiring  intergovernmental  coopera tion. The ACIR is also responsible for  recommending the most desirable allo cation  of  governmental  functions,  duties, and revenues among the sever al levels of government. This function  is central  to  today's ongoing debate  over the New Federalism.  As a former member of the ACIR, I  have been concerned that the Com mission's membership has not changed  over the years to reflect the growing  federal system. School boards, for ex ample, have enjoyed dramatic growth  in their role as a governmental unit  since  the late 1950's. Yet the ACIR  has never had school board represen tation  even  though  school  boards  today control more public dollars and  more employees than any other unit  of local government. Towns and town ships have also greatly expanded their  role as local units of government and  deserve ACIR recognition.  A very similar bill passed the Senate  late  last  year. Unfortunately,  last  minute differences in the House and  Senate versions of the bill could not be  worked out and the bill was not en acted. But both Houses are on record  in support of ACIR expansion. For  ",1983

401,415,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, there is  an  extraordinary  congregation  in  Washington this week of survivors of  the Nazi  attempt  to  eradicate  an  entire people. It has been called the  Holocaust, a word evoking  total de struction, the burning of a nation, and  genocide. The murder of a people is so  staggering that it is hard even to em brace the idea, and so we must some times focus on the real tragedies of in dividuals. The sole survivor of a large  family,  the survivor whose haunted  dreams of torture and sacrifice  tor ment him 40 years  later,  the homes  that no longer exist, the families de stroyed, and the mind-numbing num bers that overwhelm us.  It takes a special kind of courage for  the survivors to meet, Mr. President,  and the Senator from Kansas would  like to salute them for doing so. At the  same  time,  the Holocaust Museum  should give all Americans some notion  of what the Yad Vashem Museum in  Israel  has  presented,  for we must  make  absolutely  certain  that  the  memories  of  the Holocaust  remain  strong. In that way, we make the best  answer to those who tried to destroy a  people and a way of life. We will re member and continue to remember, as  we honor  those survivors who have  sought  a  belated  freedom  in  the  United States and who have become  productive citizens of our country.  Mr. President, I found it particularly  appropriate that on the very steps of  this Capitol, Vice President BusH pre sented keys to the Holocaust Museum  to these survivors. It has not always  ",1983
402,428,7,Ms. KA.,"PTUR. Mr. Speaker, I com mend  to  the  attention of my  col leagues an article by Prof. William  Kaufmann of the Massachusetts Insti tute of Technology <MIT), which ap peared  in  the Washington Post on  April 10, 1983. Professor Kaufmann's  article, explaining how we can achieve  more ""real"" security for less money, is  extremely  insightful.  In  the coming  weeks, as we consider the cost of Presi dent Reagan's defense buildup and its  April 14, 1983  impact on budget deficits and social  welfare  programs,  Professor Kauf mann's alternative deserves consider ation. I urge my colleagues to assess  the viability and practicality of a de fense plan along the lines of Professor  Kaufmann's ideas. The article follows:  THE REAGAN DEFENSE BUDGET: A CRITIQUE  CBy William W. Kaufmann)  How much does the United States need to  spend on defense during the next five years?  The Reagan administration proposes $238.6  billion for fiscal 1984 and a total of $1,553.6  billion between fiscal 1984 and fiscal 1988.  Although the president indicates that this  is a rock-bottom amount, a case can be made  that U.S. security will be better served by  canceling or stretching out some of the in vestment programs that will be responsible  for half of  these  large expenditures, by  holding active-duty military personnel at  current levels, and by using some of the sav ings  for acquisition of additional conven tional forces that are readily available and  deployable. For once, in fact, it seems possi ble to get more real defense for less money.  Consider U.S.  strategic nuclear  forces.  These constitute the foundation on which  the more  useable  power  of  the United  States and its allies rests. It is eminently de sirable to have high confidence in their re taliatory power, we can have that kind of  confidence at the present time.  Right now, the strategic offense is capa ble, even after a well-executed Soviet sur prise attack, of delivering at least 3,000 nu clear warheads on targets in the U.S.S.R.,  and that number will increase to more than  4,000 as additional Trident submarines and  air-launched cruise missiles CALCMs) are de ployed during the next five years. Even so,  prudence dictates that the strategic offense  remain both diversified and capable of de stroying a wide variety of targets (including  hard targets) in the face of Soviet efforts to  undermine it.  Prudence, however, does not require the  deployment of two ballistic missiles with a  hard-target kill capability, two heavy bomb ers in close succession, two versions of the  ALCM, or a submarine-launched version of  the nuclear cruise missile. Nor does pru dence necessitate any rush toward the de ployment of a technically questionable bal listic missile defense, a more modern conti nental air defense that could be destroyed  by ballistic missiles, or a  few pieces of a  command-control  system  ostensibly  de signed for the conduct of a protracted nu clear war that no one understands how to  fight or to terminate.  In short, nothing but a  few  campaign  pledges would be  lost by eliminating  the  most obvious redundancies and excesses in  the administration's program for moderniz ing the strategic forces. More specifically,  cancellation of the MX, the B1, the modern ized air defenses and several of the more  exotic sensors based in space, and decelera tion of the program for ballistic missile de fense, would save more than $57 billion in  outlays over the next five years without in  any way jeopardizing the retaliatory power  of the strategic forces.  Conventional  forces  are what give  the  nation its real military leverage, and it is  considerable, despite repeated and mystify ing efforts  to downgrade  it. Current U.S.  ground and tactical air forces,  in conjunc tion with allied capabilities, have a high  probability of conducting a successful for ward defense if concentrated in a single the",1983
403,441,7,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  December 1981, and again in February  1983, I  introduced legislation to stop  the erroneous payments of social secu rity benefits to deceased persons. Re cently this bill was included as section  337  in H.R. 1900, the Social Security  Act Amendments of 1983.  Section 337 requires the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to gather  from the States a data base of each  certificate information, set up a com puter system with  the data base  to  cross-check beneficiary records, identi fy  through  computer matches  de ceased people on benefit  roles and,  after validating the computer identifi cation of a deceased person,  remove  the deceased person from the roles.  The provision also allows Health and  Human Services  to share  the data,  under specified safeguards, with other  Federal agencies and  the States. As  many as 10 Federal agencies can bene fit from the use of this data to purge  deceased  recipients from  their roles.  All of the States can use the data to  tighten  up  various  State-run  pro grams.  The key legislative provision of sec tion 337, without which the Social Se curity Administration <SSA) has been  unable to establish a computer s~stem  using death certificate data, is an ex-  elusion of the death certificate data  from the Freedom of Information and  Privacy Acts. This  exclusion  allows  States with confidentiality laws which  prohibit the public disclosure of death  certificate information to release the  information without breaching such  laws. The Freedom of Information Act  <FOIA) grants the public legal access  to  any Federal  agency  documents,  except  those  important for national  security. Without an exclusion from  FOIA, the public could obtain death  certificate data from SSA and  then  the States'  laws  could be violated.  With an exclusion from  this act for  the death certificate data, the States  will be willing to let SSA use the data  since the exclusion protects the data  from public disclosure and their laws  would not be violated.  The drafting and passage of this sec tion were aided greatly by the work of  SSA, the National Center for Health  Statistics,  the State  registrars,  the  General Accounting Office <GAO) and  Senator ROBERT DOLE. Of particular  note were pilot projects which SSA  and GAO each developed based on the  methodology suggested by H.R. 5188,  which I  introduced in the 97th Con gress. Both pilots  found  significant  numbers of deceased persons on bene fit roles. SSA's pilot found millions of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dollars in social security payments to  the deceased, while GAO found death  fraud in nine different Federal agen cies. These studies showed the efficacy  of H.R. 5188 and helped insure its pas sage.  The legislative history of H.R. 5188  may be of interest. The bill was made  a part of the Miscellaneous Social Se curity Act Amendments of 1982, after  the Social Security Administration tes tified in support of H.R. 5188 during  hearings on the miscellaneous amend ments in December 1982. The bill sub sequently was made a part of the Mis cellaneous Social Security Act Amend ments of 1983, which in turn was writ ten  into H.R.  1900.  Senator DoLE  added an amended version of the bill,  incorporating suggestions by GAO and  SSA, into S. 1, the Senate social secu rity reform legislation. Then, finally,  that version was adopted in the House Senate conference on H.R. 1900.  The legislation becomes effective on  January 1, 1984. My only concern now  is  its effective  implementation. The  bill purposefully gives the Secretary of  Health and Human Services some dis cretion in determining which Federal  agency should maintain the data bank.  The most likely place for the data  bank is SSA itself, because SSA will  have the greatest use for the informa tion. The other major alternative  is  the National Center for Health Statis tics <NCHS) because NCHS now al ready maintains a data bank contain ing some of the death certificate infor mation needed for the section 337 data  bank.  I have been working with GAO and  SSA to provide some oversight of the  implementation of  the bill and am  pleased  to  note  that Health  and  Human Services is proceeding quickly.  I will continue to follow the agency's  progress closely; section 337  requires  Health and Human Services to report  on  the  section's  implementation  in  1984 and I am hopeful that by that  time the system will be in place.e  THE B-52: AN AGING WARRIOR  HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April13, 1983  e ",1983
404,441,7,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  Christian  Science Monitor  recently  had two of its reporters fly with the  crew of a B-52H, one of  those air planes that make up one-third of our  nuclear deterrent force.  Their report stressed the fact that  the B-52 ""has been reburbished and  modernized as much as  it can. The  plane is hard put to generate enough  electricity to run the new gear. Many  of the spare parts manufacturers have  gone out of business       ."" Yes, one  officer proudly states that the B-52 is  8681  not ""an unsafe plane"" and contains  many systems that are ""state of the  art."" But the general impression left  by this article is that the B-52 simply  cannot do the job in the technological  environment of the 1980's and beyond.  If the radar image of the B-1 can be  compared to the size of a desk,  the  radar image of the B-52 is the size of  an airplane hanger. We simply cannot  risk our national security on such an  airplane. The B-1 is needed.  At this point I insert in the RECORD,  ""The B-52's: Short on Space, Long on  Thunder,"" from the Christian Science  Monitor, Friday, April 8, 1983:  [From the Christian Science Monitor, Apr.  8, 1983]  THE B-52's: SHORT ON SPACE, LONG ON  THUNDER  <By Brad Knickerbocker)  The morning sounds of an office coming  to life grow louder as Chuck Holland and  his colleagues gather to discuss the coming  day's work. Their briefcases stuffed with  papers and books, thermos bottles and sand wiches, could easily belong to young lawyers  or accountants.  But their workplace this day is out across  the flight line at a US Air Force base. A  chilly, windswept  space  separates  them  from most Americans in what they do but  brings  them very close  to an increasingly  common concern: how  to prevent nuclear  war.  Captain Holland is a bomber pilot. At 29  he is the ""old man"" of a crew of six young  men prepared to drop and launch in a single  flight more destructive power than 100 Hir oshimas would have seen.  They  fly Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress,  known among crew members as the ""Buff,""  for  ""Big Ugly Fat Fellow."" Decked out  somewhat  uncomfortably  in  parachutes,  helmets, and oxygen masks, two journalists  have  joined  this  day's  training mission.  They are trying to find out something about  the airplane some say should be relegated to  the Smithsonian Institution and about the  crews, whose members often are younger  than the planes they fly.  Our  craft  this  cold,  lowering  South  Dakota morning is a B-52H, the newest B52 and last delivered  to the Air Force 21  years ago. That means Chuck Holland and  company probably were concentrating on  the TV program ""Leave it to Beaver,"" Little  League baseball, and the mysteries of long  division when  their bomber first entered  service some 9,000 flight hours ago.  As we approach the hulking craft, which  has  a  ground  crew  standing by  and  a  number of umbilicals attached, I notice that  its camouflaged skin is wrinkled. ""Twenty  years of flying will do that to you,"" explains  Holland. ""Just like a face.""  After a quick walkaround, a  tug here, a  kick  there,  crew members  burrow  up  through a hatch in the plane's belly, crawl  to their assigned spots, and strap into ejec tion seats.  The aircraft commander and copilot are  up  front  in  the only spot with windows.  Electronics warfare officer and gunner are  12  feet behind,  facing aft. Navigator and  radar-navigator are down a ladder beneath  pilot and copilot in a cave dimly lit by the  erie, red glow of what seems like a thousand  gauges and dials. Reporters are wedged in  between black boxes and will spend most of  the next eight hours on hands and knees.  ",1983
405,454,7,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  bring to the attention of this body the  roguish and  irresponsible manner  in  which the Interstate Commerce Com mission is implementing provisions of  the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.  During our consideration of this rail road reform legislation, I and others  worked  to strike a balance between  the revenue interests of the railroads  with those of coal and other captive  shippers by maintaining an appropri ate degree of rate regulation. Since en actment of  the Staggers Rail Act,  I  have watched as the Commission con sidered and decided how to interpret  and promulgate key provisions of the  act. I have repeatedly called for con gressional oversight hearings on this  process. And, I have issued alerts when  I felt the Commission was ignoring the  intent of the law.  However,  these  efforts  and  the  intent of Congress to provide captive  shipper protections,  have  been  for  naught. The ICC has taken a cavalier  attitude  toward  implementing provi sions of the act meant to protect cap tive shippers from monopolistic pric ing practices and has mounted a cam paign  to administratively deregulate  rail pricing  for captive  traffic;  that  traffic which lacks viable transporta tion alternatives and is captive to the  railroads. In a number of proceedings  the ICC has subverted the meaning of  market dominance,  sanctioned  a  15  percent per year increase above infla tion on coal movements, has deter mined that captive, or market domi nant, movements may be made to pay  for other less profitable traffic carried  by  the  railroads and has exempted  from any  type of  regulation export  coal to the east, gulf and west coasts.  To the detriment of coal producers  and users such as the utility industry  which purchases about 80 percent of  all coal produced and depends on this  coal for 52 percent of its electrical gen eration, the ICC's various and sundry  actions have lead to:  Unrealistic and illegal definition of  rail market dominance by  including  product and geographic competition,  leaving  captive  shippers with  little  prospect for recourse before the Com mission;  Adoption  of  a  cross-subsidization  scheme which  enables  a  carrier  to  charge a disproportionate amount of  its fixed costs to captive shippers so  that it can move  less profitable and  more competitive traffic;  A ruling that rail rates on coal may  increase by the arbitrary amount of 15  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  percent per year above  inflation de spite  the fact  that Congress  in  the  Staggers Rail Act already provided for  inflation-based increases and a zone of  rate flexibility which allows an addi tional 6 percent per year increase;  Unrealistic definition of railroad rev enue adequacy based solely on the cur rent cost of capital, despite past use of  other relevant tools of financial analy sis, which has resulted in the determi nation that only two class I railroads  are revenue adequate; and  Exemption from regulation of coal  export  traffic despite  the  fact  that  U.S. coal is already 15  to 20 percent  more expensive on the world market  largely due to transportation costs.  In short, the ICC has declared an  open season on capitive coal  traffic.  Already faced with escalating railroad  transportation costs-a 50-percent in crease over the past 3 years-coal ship pers and the electric utility and export  markets  they serve have nothing  to  look  forward  to  for  effective  relief  from oppressive market conditions. At  stake is the basic fabric of a sound na tional energy policy. Over 65 percent  of all coal produced is transported by  rail with 85 percent of  this amount  captive  to  the  railroads. Without a  doubt, higher transportation costs for  electric utilities using coal to generate  over 52 percent of the Nation's elec tricity will be passed on to the con sumer.  According to a recent study conduct ed by the National Economic Research  Associates, Inc., deregulated rail trans portation rates for coal would be any where from 30  to 60 percent higher  than regulated rates. In 1981, the rail roads earned about $6 billion in reve nues  for hauling coal with coal ac counting for 27 percent of carloadings  and 20 percent of gross freight reve nues. Of this $6 billion, electric utili ties paid about $4.7 billion. The NERA  study indicates that if coal rates were  deregulated in 1981,  this would have  translated into an extra delivered coal  cost to utilities of between $1.4 to $2.8  billion, by 1990, an extra $2 to $4 bil lion. It should be noted that currently  on the average 30 percent of the deliv ered price of coal to a utility is due to  railroad transportation costs.  Mr. Speaker, I submit that this  is  not the scenario Congress envisioned  in enacting the Staggers Rail Act of  1980. The act was intended to provide  the financial mechanism for the resto ration, maintenance, and improvement  of  the rail system. The shortage of  capital to invest in rail plant has large ly disappeared and  the major coal hauling  railroads  are  now  in  fact  highly profitable:  April 1#,, 1983  [In percent]  Railroad and coal revenues  revenue)  (total  Profitability  (return on equity)  Growth  (earnings  per share)  Burlington Northern  (29.4) .................  csx Corp.

Now, it is time to attend to an other purpose of the act, that of pro viding captive shipper protections.  Today,  I  am  introducing  amend ments to title 49 which will accomplish  this task. In light of the recent deci sions made  by  the  ICC-decisions  which  run  roughshod  over  captive  shippers-it appears it is time to clari fy what exactly is meant by market  dominance,  provide  commonsense  business  standards  for  determining  revenue adequacy and insert addition al guidance with respect to developing  standards for rail rates. In no way do  these amendments run counter to the  intent  of  the  Staggers Rail Act.  Rather,  they enhance and  reinforce  the provisions of this act intended to  protect captive shippers.  The  amendments would  establish  three basic tests in the determination  of market dominance. As  in current  law, making  a  showing  of market  dominance  is a prerequisite  for  the  ICC to investigate a rate. The first test  is  the revenue-to-variable cost ratios  which establish the threshold for ICC  jurisdiction over rail rates contained in  the Staggers Rail Act. Second,  the  Commission would consider whether  the shipper has a substantial invest ment  in  railroad  related plant and  equipment and third, whether 70 per cent or more of a specific movement  was handled by the rail carrier. The  latter two tests were used by the Com mission prior to its recent proceeding  on market dominance in which it de cided to include both product and geo graphic competition during consider ation of the presence of market domi nance.  It should be made clear  that  the  Staggers Rail Act did not require a  change in approach to market domi nance and in fact retained the defini tion of market dominance contained in  the 4-R Act <Railroad Revitalization  and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976).  As such, market dominance is defined  as ""an absence of effective competi tion from other carriers or modes of  transportation for the traffic or move ment  to which a  rate applies      The Commission's inclusion of product  and geographic competition went far  beyond the transportation competition  definition of market dominance pro vided by both the 4-R and Staggers  Acts. As such, the recent Commission  proceeding did not reflect any direc tives of the act or the intent of the  *""  ",1983

414,467,7,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, earlier I  discussed the tragic events of the Civil  War and their impact upon our na tional  legislature. The  force of  the  War struck at the very core of the  American Republic. Economically, po litically, and socially the nation had  been irreversibly altered.  The direct cost exceeded $7 billion in  loans and interest. That was only the  starting place. Additional losses in de stroyed  land,  companies,  buildings,  transportation  lines,  and  personal  property could never be calculated.  The price paid in human life extract ed  something  from  almost  every  family  in the North and the South.  When the fighting ceased, a saddened  nation counted some 620,000 dead and  thousands more wounded and maimed.  No tally could be given of the numbers  who died from malnutrition and sick nesses, or whose mental health never  recovered  from  the  war  trauma.  Beyond calculation were the animos ities-some  to  linger well  into  the  twentieth century-that the war un leashed.1  The significant accomplishment of  the war was that it freed the slaves,  ending a life of bondage for four mil lion  black  people.  This  freedom  marked the initial step in the exten sion of equal representation under the  Constitution  to  all Americans. The  struggle ahead proved to be filled with  Footnotes at end of article.  frustration and grief for blacks and  whites alike. But, for the moment, it  was worthy to celebrate the establish ment of a free life for former slaves.  With this freedom came a host of new  problems  for  the nation. Questions  about the future for slaves, the best  ways to develop and fulfill the prom ises of equality, freedom, and suffrage  would not be easily resolved.  The political arena was the appro priate place to thrash out these diffi culties. However, the war left the po litical structure of the South devastat ed with state and local governments  no longer in a functional condition. At  the national  level,  the political ma chinery was characterized by confu sion.  Eleven states had withdrawn their  representatives  from  the  Congress  during the war and the maintenance  of the national governmental process  had fallen upon the remaining twenty five.  Now  as  the Southern  states  sought  to  regain  their  privileges  within the Union, both legal confusion  and jangled emotions served to frus trate and retard the reunion. Loyalist  states displayed a reluctance to accept  the  returning South. The  readmit tance of Southern members, likely to  be Democrats who would be hostile to  the plans of those who sought to reor ganize the Southern structure, could  only upset  the control exercised by  the Senate's Republicans.  This epoch-known among histori ans as  the Era of Reconstruction spanned a troubled twelve-year period.  The  difficulties  and  challenges  of  those years often have been misunder stood, as evident by  the sensational  and bombastic vocabulary used to de scribe  the events between 1865 and  1877. We tend to accept the popular  image that this time of reconstruction  was a vicious, cruel, and excessive era.  Today, I shall examine the work of  the Senate during the earliest of those  particularly demanding years.  I will  suggest  that the Senate, faced with  the staggering task of returning the  eleven states of  the Confederacy  to  their former national status, as well as  responding to the needs and expecta tions of newly freed slaves, answered  these challenges with purpose and re solve. With no prior experience in any  similar  circumstance,  the  Senate,  indeed the whole Congress, could only  have felt uncertain and confused. As a  result,  their  actions,  in  retrospect,  often appear haphazard or poorly con ceived. Given the grave nature of the  situation, we should not allow some of  their  lesser successes  to overshadow  their underlying unfaltering efforts to  deal with a  profound constitutional  crisis.  Members of the Senate found them selves  facing  issues  crucial  to  the  American democratic system. We are  in the debt of our earlier colleagues  '  ",1983
415,493,7,Mr.  PRESSLER.," Mr.  President,  today I am submitting a resolution to  promote U.S. agricultural and other  exports by opposing unnecessary re strictions and  regulations developed  and administered by international or ganizations.  On March 22, I reported to this body  that I had expressed my concerns to  Secretary of State George P. Shultz  about  recent  developments  in  the  United Nations  that could adversely  affect exports of American products,  especially  agricultural  commodities  and finished goods.  My concerns  focused generally on  the dramatic increase in the number  and scope of U.N. attempts to regulate  or otherwise influence our internation al trade, and my specific concern was  the proposed worldwide consumer pro tection guidelines pending before the  U.N. Economic and Social Council. As  Ambassador  Jeane  J.  Kirkpatrick  stated in her article, ""Global Paternal ism,"" published in the January /Febru ary 1983 issue of Regulation:  Attempts  to deal with  these problems  [health and safety] within the U.N., howev er, too often are caught up, in a very crude  kind of anti-capitalist ideology that is more  concerned with restricting and discrediting  multinational/transnational corporations.  Mr. President, this is a subject that  should concern all of us in Congress  from a jurisdictional, as well as a sub stantive, point of view. I chair two sub committees with  foreign  trade over sight responsibilities, and I represent a  State that has significant interests in  matters affecting foreign  trade. Yet,  neither I nor any similarly situated  colleague, to my knowledge, was given  direct notice of  the pendency  and  scope of these so-called consumer pro tection guidelines that !ire expressly  intended  to affect  the regulation of  both our foreign and domestic com merce.  Unless article I of the Constitution  was amended recently, Congress still  has exclusive jurisdiction over the reg ulation of American commerce here  and abroad. Yet, according to a State  Department response  to my original  letter, only the views of trade associa tions, consumer groups and Federal  agencies were directly solicited by the  executive branch  to approve  in  the  name of  the United States concepts  for regulating our commerce. What is  next-the signing of binding foreign  trade agreements without our review?  Mr. President, because of the impor tance of this subject to American agri culture, trade and this body's own con stitutional mandate, I ask unanimous  consent that the State Department's  response  to my original  inquiry be  printed at this point in the RECORD,  followed by my reply to that response,  and my most recent letter to Secretary  Shultz. My  original  five  questions  appear at page 6559 of the March 22,  1983 RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  Record, as follows:  DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  Washington, D.C., Aprill, 1983.  Hon. LARRY PRESSLER,  U.S. Senate.  I  DEAR SENATOR PRESSLER: Secretary Shultz  has asked me to respond to that portion of  your letter of March 10 which deals with  the draft United Nations ""Guidelines for  Consumer Protection.""  am pleased to enclose answers  to  the  specific questions which you asked. If you  wish additional details  from  the Depart ment of State, your staff should contact  William Brew, Special Assistant for Legisla tive, Consumer and Public Affairs; Bureau  of Economic and Business Affairs; Tele phone: 632-9310.  Sincerely,  ALVIN PAUL DRISCHLER,  Acting Assistant Secretary  for Congressional Relations.  With respect to the Draft U.N. Guidelines  for  Consumer  Protection  now  pending  before  the Economic and Social Council,  please answer the following questions sepa rately:  Q<a>: What is the present position of the  United States on these Guidelines, and how  was that decision arrived at?  A: The general approach of the comments  on the Guidelines, which were delivered to  the U.N. Secretariat on March 25, is recogni tion of the importance of the goal of con sumer  protection both  domestically  and  internationally,  but  skepticism  that  the  Guidelines are the best or only means of  achieving  that goal. Our comments dealt  with every section of the Guidelines, oppos ing some concepts, approving of others, and  raising  questions  about  the  remainder.  Copies of the Guidelines and the March 25  comments are enclosed.  The  comments were  developed  on an  interagency basis, with each agency com menting on sections of interest to it at meet ings or in writing. Each agency was provided  copies of public <usually trade association>  comments  that had  been  received. The  State Department served as the ""secretar iat"" for  this  interagency process, drafting  the comments on the basis of the views ex pressed.  Q<b>: What evaluations were made with  respect to the effect of the Guidelines,  if  implemented worldwide, on the export of  agricultural commodities?  A: No econometric or analogous analysis  of the potential impact of the Guidelines on  exports of agricultural commodities was at tempted. The draft Guidelines  focus,  in  part, on food products and national food  policies and, except for one significant ex ception, speak in fairly general terms; por tions of the Guidelines were reviewed for  consistency with U.S.  policies  in  similar  areas. The exception is a reference to highly  processed foods; as can be seen from the en closed comments, the negative reference to  such foods <which might be interpreted as  meaning value-added agricultural commod ities) was not accepted.

416,506,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I would  like to take a minute to share with you  the wonderful opportunity for an un forgettable adventure that Utah has  to offer. I will not detract from the  ""Greatest Snow on Earth"" offered by  the Wasatch Mountains  in Utah or  the  other wonderful  opportunities  there, but that is only the tip of the  adventure iceberg.  This last year I was presented with a  serious problem in the southern part  of my State. The road from southern  Utah to the north rim of the Grand  Canyon was not scheduled  to open  until July 1.

In  the  course  of  this  investigation  I  found disappointed visitors  from 41  States and 13  foreign countries who  had come to see this great wonder of  the world and were prevented from  doing so. But 'I  found much, much  more; and I have worked to be certain  that the wonderful adventure of a life time to be found in southern Utah can  be better understood and enjoyed by  more  citizens  of our  country  and  indeed,  the world. On  circle, referred to as the ""Grand Circle  of the Southwest,"" can be found 7 na tional parks-approximately 20  per cent of all national parks-including  t~e Grand Canyon in Arizona, 6 na tiOnal monuments, 1 national  recre ational area, 19 State parks, and 1  tribal park and historical monument.  All of these natural wonders can be  visited in the comfort and convenience  of your own car on self-guided tours  or, if you wish, in motor coaches on  modern  paved highways-an  ture  unmatched  anywhere  world.  While, naturally,  I would  suggest  that you come  to Salt Lake City  to  this 900-mil~  ad~en­ in  the   ",1983

418,519,7,Mr. LEVITAS., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from Ohio.  ,1983
419,519,7,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  think  the  gentleman  absolutely  right in objecting to the trivialization  of some of the serious issues that were  brought up, and his amendment on  the build-down  is  certainly one of  them. I voted against it. I have some  serious problems with it.  For one  thing, I  felt the Congress  should not put itself in the position of  trying to dictate the details of arms  control settlements; and second, I felt  that unless we spelled out the kind of  weapons we were getting rid of versus  the kind we were replacing them with,  there was some basis  for saying we  still might end up with a more power ful nuclear force in one more accurate,  more powerful warhead than the two  that were disposed of. But that is an  issue which I do not think we need to  go into at great length today.  I do feel, however, that it is impor tant for those of us who support the  nuclear  freeze  resolution-and  I  am  one of those, and I support it strong ly-to make it clear that we are under  no  illusions  about  the necessity of  maintaining the continued ability  to  offset whatever nuclear forces the So viets have until such time as they and  we work out an agreed upon freeze  and reduction. And the reduction is, of  course, the most important objective.  Those of us who support the freeze  simply feel that at some point we have  to call a halt, and I am satisfied that  the scare tactics that are used by the  administration,  including  the Presi dent himself, implying that somehow  the Russians have a  tremendous ad vantage in strategic weapons over the  United States at this time, are present ing something that is simply not true.  And they are making that statement,  knowing that it is not true, but for  purposes of trying to stampede the op position into giving way.  That is not to say that there are not  specific threats which must be coun tered, and particularly in Europe with  the SS-20's. I do not see how we can  tolerate the continued deployment of  those huge numbers of SS-20's against  NATO countries. It is clearly an effort  to do an end run on the United States  and to alter the balance of power in  Europe, which we must not tolerate.  The Soviets need to understand that,  but we need to be realistic and flexible  in our efforts to try to counter that  and not merely use it, as I think the  administration started out doing, for  its own propaganda ends.  So there is a lot to be said for get ting serious on both sides of this issue.  I do feel that the Soviets are serious,  and  if we are serious, we can make  progress. If they decide we are not se rious, then they are just going to try  to exploit  the  thing politically, and  that would be a terrible tragedy for all  mankind.  ",1983
420,519,7,Mr. LEVITAS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Ohio <Mr. SEIBER LING) and in conclusion let me say that  I appreciate his comments on, for ex ample, the build-down concept, which,  I want to reemphasize, is simply a con cept. I trust that as the discussion of  that concept proceeds, the gentleman  from Ohio and others will look at it  with real seriousness in terms of struc turing a build down of nuclear forces  in a way that addresses the matter of  the megatonnage of  reduced  forces,  the development of  single warhead  missiles, and a de-MIRV'ing of our  present arsenals on both sides.  I think, as the gentleman and others  in the debate indicated, if that is the  case, we should take a  look at these  other alternative approaches and they  will  see  the  importance of moving  toward  arms  reduction within  that  context.  ",1983
421,519,7,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield further?  ",1983
422,519,7,Mr. LEVIT AS.," Let me just make this  one concluding remark first.  I am troubled that there are some  who support the nuclear freeze who  believe  that  simply  by  freezing  at  present levels and nothing else, with  no more testing, no more R&D, and no  more deployment, we  are  going  to  move toward a safer world. That is cer tainly not  the case, because as our  forces and indeed the Soviet forces de teriorate, we raise the hair trigger re sponse mode both sides would have to  engage in, and I certainly would not  want  to see American  forces sitting  beside  silos of deteriorating, unreli able,  unpredictable  capabilities, nor  would  I want  the President of our  country to know that he could not rely  upon whatever forces we have at our  disposal.  So I  think that we have got to be  very concerned about doing more than  just  freezing,  whatever  ""freezing""  might mean  today, but  I  think we  have got  to drive ourselves and the  Soviet Union with realistic incentives  to reduction of nuclear forces in a way  that gives both sides assurances for  their own security.

467,545,7,Mr. DOLE.," Madam President, today  we begin discussing the merits of with holding income taxes due on interest  and dividend income. We have had a  lot of discussion on this floor about  this issue, but it has been confused, in  the view of this Senator, with the pri mary issue then on the floor-first of  all, the jobs bill, then social security.  Now, in order to consider this matter  more or less on its merits, we may be  borrowing trouble by bringing up an S  numbered revenue bill to send to the  House of Representatives.  The Senator from Kansas is certain ly mindful of the emotions that this  issue and the possibility of extended  debate have generated already. The  Senator from Kansas  is not certain  what will happen on the cloture vote  tomorrow or on following days, but  this  is an important  issue. We have  over 500 amendments to dispose of in  the event cloture should be invoked.  This Senator is certain there will be  time to allow all of his colleagues one  opportunity to examine the merits of  this issue.  The President, on Saturday, issued a  strong statement in support of with holding, indicating his continued com mitment to tax reform and tax compli ance, not new taxes, not repealing in dexing, not repealing the third year of  the tax cut, not repealing other tax re ductions we have enacted in the past  couple of years in this Congress. But  the Senator from Kansas is aware, and  I am certain others are aware, that in  the 1983 budget the President of the  United States suggested we take a look  at withholding of  taxes on  interest  and dividend  income.  I  am pleased  that, in the President's radio message  last Saturday, he indicated he has not  yielded from that position.  The President indicated in no uncer tain terms that he had his pen behind  his ear; he was prepared to veto any  repeal of  the  legislation passed  last  year that would require withholding  of tax due on interest and dividend  income.  Notwithstanding that, we have had a  lot of discussion. We have been del uged with mail. We have had a very  well-financed  lobbying campaign car ried on by financial institutions in this  country. Much of the information sent  to us has been  inaccurate. We con stantly have seen advocates of repeal  refer to this as a withholding tax instead of  tax withholding. In fact,  I  suggest that the President made that  mistake  in  the first sentence of his  radio address on Saturday. But not withstanding that, it was a good ad dress and it indicated very clearly the  President's position on this issue.  Madam President, this Senator did  not come to the decision to support in terest and dividend withholding easily.  The Dole-Grassley compliance bill in troduced a little over a year ago con tained most of the compliance provi sions which were incorporated in the  Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility  Act. It did not, however, include with holding on interest and dividends. The  Senator from Iowa and I opted to rely  primarily on  increased  reporting  re quirements and more stringent penal ties  to  improve  tax compliance. The  only withholding provision in the bill  as originally  introduced was pension  withholding. However, when  the Fi nance Committee  received a budget  target of $98.3 billion in increased rev enues over 3 years, we were faced with  the decision on how best to raise those  taxes. We decided it was far more ap propriate  to do our best  to collect  taxes that are owed under present law  and are not being paid than to impose  new taxes on the people now paying  their taxes. As a result, we  took an other hard  look  at how we  could  strengthen  the  compliance  package  without imposing unacceptable levels  of interference with the lives of Amer ican citizens. We found that the per centage of the compliance on interest  and dividends was unacceptably low,  especially  in comparison with wages,  which is about 99 percent. Compliance  on interest and dividend payment of  taxes was around 85 percent.  It seemed to a majority of us on the  Senate Finance Committee that with holding on interest and dividends was  a compliance measure that was both  effective and fair. We have had with holding on wages for 40 years and I  would guess the working people in this  country could make  the same argu ment the American Bankers Associa tion makes now, that is, ""If you did  not take the taxes out of my check  every 2 weeks or every month, I could  put that money in the bank and make  interest and then pay my taxes at the  end of the year.""  We have a  99-percent compliance  rate with the people in this country  who work  for  a  living and  receive  wages and salaries. We have an 89percent compliance  rate with  those  who receive interest income. The divi dend compliance rate  is a  little less  than  the  interest  compliance  rate,  about 85 percent.  It has been suggested by some that  all we have  to do  is audit more re turns, hire more IRS agents. We are  informed by  the  Internal Revenue  Service that less than 2 percent of the  11~59 0-87-18 (Pt. 7)  ",1983
468,558,7,Mr. KASTEN., But I think it is im portant to recognize  that an expert  such as former Senator Sam Ervin be lieves that it is a constitutional right  of people across this country to com municate with their Congress.  ,1983
469,558,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, just  to  respond,  I  do not  think anyone  denies the right of petition. I  think  the Senator from Kansas has probably  said  it the best. He said  the banks  have  the right to petition Congress,  but not  to bury  it.  I  think  that  is  really what we have seen over  this  period of time.  No  one  questions,  obviously,  the  right to petition, but I will also say to  the  Senator  from Wisconsin  that  never before  in my 20 years  in the  Senate have I seen such a campaign by  a group that has so distorted and mis represented the truth. I do think it is  legitimate and fair to point out to the  Senate that when these cards come in  they come in various types of big enve lopes. Unfortunately I cannot include  them in the REcoRD, but the fact is  they come packed in big bundles such  as  this, and they come  in envelopes  paid for by the banks.  This is a good deal different from  what I think most of us consider peti tioning  the Government, which  is  when the letters are sent by individual  citizens who are sufficiently concerned  about  the  issue  that  they  take  the  time to write it themselves, and to put  a stamp on it. I think it is important  that we characterize the nature of this  appeal to the Congress for what it is.  The Senator from Kansas and I have  tried  to point out  that  the claims  being made are a distortion and a mis representation.  Second we  have pointed out  the  nature and quality of  the petitions,  that we have received.  ",1983
470,558,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I will just  take a minute. I wanted to comment  on the statement. As I mentioned ear lier  on,  the Senator  from Kansas  pointed out that even the President is  capable of getting confused on this. In  fact  I  learned about  this 6 minutes  before he was to go on radio on Satur day and tried to get word to the Presi dent of the United States that it is not  a withholding tax, it is tax withhold ing. But it is hard to reach the Presi dent in 6 minutes, at least hard for  this Senator to reach the President in  6 minutes. But beyond that, the state ment was extremely good. He indicat ed, I think rather firmly, that he feels  strongly  about  this  tax  compliance  measure.  I want to just insert in the RECORD I  regret  somebody-whoever wrote  that for the President-either was im precise or does not know the differ ence. The President does know the dif ference and he indicated that clearly  on the radio program. But I did want  to put in the RECORD a letter to my dis tinguished colleague from Wisconsin,  Senator KAsTEN, from John E. Chapo ton, Assistant Secretary  from Tax  Policy, which  indicates  the Senator  from Wisconsin's effort to sort of fill  up the void here by attaching 1099's is  additional  not going  to obtain  compliance at all.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  tax  Hon. ROBERT W. KASTEN, Jr.,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D. C.  DEAR BoB: This is in reply to your request  for estimates of additional  revenues  that  could be raised through various compliance  measures, including the reporting provision  contained in S. 222.  Requiring taxpayers to submit copies of  forms 1099 provided to them by payors of  interest and dividends is estimated to have a  negligible revenue effect since the perceived  risk of noncompliance will not be apprecia bly greater than under current law.  Increased use of magnetic computer tapes  by payors in reporting payments made to  the  IRS and  increased cross-checking of  forms 1099 against taxpayer claims of divi dends and interest received would, in princi pal, give rise to higher levels of compliance.  Under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsi bility Act of 1982, however. the Secretary  has already been directed to prescribe regu lations to assure optimal use of magnetic  tape reporting. Thus, increased use of mag netic tapes, together with the increased IRS  cross-checking that such use will facilitate,  has already been assumed in estimates of  current law tax revenues.  The IRS currently has the authority to  request  additional  funds  for  stepped-up  audit and debt collection programs. Un doubtedly  some  additional  tax  revenues  could be raised through such efforts. How ever,  it would be a serious mistake  to at tempt to attain desired compliance levels by  substituting a vast audit program for with holding on interest and dividends. An audit  program of the magnitude necessary would  be viewed as taxpayer harassment because  millions of new  taxpayer contacts, audits,  and  legal proceedings would be  initiated.  Such contacts, audits, and legal proceedings  would be required in cases where the appar ent underpayment of tax is very small. This  process would seriously undermine tax ad ministration efforts  to  insure honest  tax payers that our tax system based on volun tary compliance is both workable and fair.  Thus, withholding is by far the most effec tive means of combating the noncompliance  problem  in  the area of interest and divi dends.  Sincerely,  JOHN E. CHAPOTON,  Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy.  ",1983
471,558,7,Mr. DOLE.," We are going to lose all  the revenue we would get on withhold ing if we repeal withholding and adopt  the provision  in the Kasten amend ment which simply  requires attach ment of a 1099  form, unless we are  willing to spend a billion dollars a year  to hire 30,000  to 40,000 more  IRS  agents. That would make it a jobs bill,  we could call it jobs bill No. 2 since we  have already passed one jobs bill. But  in this Senator's view it is not the kind  of a jobs bill that I want any part of. I  do not want 30,000 or 40,000  IRS  agents scattered around the country,  30,000 or 40,000 more, bothering tax payers  to  collect  taxes  on  small  ",1983
472,571,7,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I am going to conclude my re marks. I have other things I should  like to say on this subject. In the hope  that I will have more opportunities  during  the course of  this week and  this debate to do so, rather than take  another hour or two of the time of  this body or of the principals on each  side, I will just express my apprecia tion to the chairman of the Finance  Committee for the effort he has put  forth in behalf of an issue that is hard  to understand and very difficult  to  make any substantial political gain out  of.  I will conclude with my observations  about tax equity and fairness. Also, I  suppose it relates to the concerns we  all  have  about  the  representative  system of government.  As I watch my colleagues get ready  for the 1984 campaign and reflect on  the way in which I got ready for the  1982 campaign, I notice that the old  labels of liberal and conservative are  kind of out the window; and the new  label, the one that seems to be work ing best for lots of folks on both sides  of the aisle is called populist-conserv atism. I would not label it a fad; it is  probably a very good  thing at  this  point in the history of this country.  But it says in effect that the folks are  always right, and you ought to be on  the side of the folks.  It overlooks one little fact, and that  is that the folks usually are right. I  guess there is no question about that.  But the folks also do not have to come  down here and make those 200, 300,  400, 500, or 600 decisions about which  they are right and balance them when  they conflict as they often do. They  are relatively selective today about the  decisions they would like us to make  and the way in which they would like  us to make them.  This is not directed at the Senator  from Wisconsin,  for  the  reasons  I  stated earlier, but with  the  luxury  that some have of deciding that a pop ular issue today may not be popular  tomorrow so we had better be with it  today, probably is not going to do a  great deal to restore the confidence of  the people  of  this  country  in  the  system of representative government.  That confidence is clearly and totally  at a  low ebb, or this would not be a  populist-conservative issue. This would  not be the kind of thing to really turn  on the people of this country.  As  We started last year on a very im portant course  in tax policy  in  this  country. Instead of raising the rates  on the taxpayers of this country, we  started on the course of broadening  the base under the tax system.  the chairman of  the Finance  Committee knows, we are approaching  the point at which more money goes  out through tax loopholes created by  our predecessor  than goes  into  the  Treasury, and that is true for about  only 15 or 25 percent of the people of  this country. It is not true with the  other 75 to 80 percent of the people of  this country.  The process of tax equity and fair ness has  just barely gotten off  the  ground. A lot of things remain to be  done. They do not all fall in the area  of tax compliance. Many fall  in the  area of changes in the deductions and  credits and so forth. That is a subject  which, with  the  indulgence  of  the  chairman of the Finance Committee if  this  is  the appropriate  issue on  which  to do  that-I should  like  to  come back to the floor  to discuss at  greater length, because probably it is  the most  important  issue facing  the  people of this country who want to be  wage earners, who want to be interest  income earners, who want to be divi dend earners.  I thank the chairman of the Finance  Committee for yielding to me for this  opportunity.  ",1983
473,571,7,Mr. DOLE.,"  I  thank  the  distin guished Senator from Minnesota for  his steadfast support.  I must say that when this package  was put  together  last year  in  the  Senate Finance Committee, 6 of the 11  Republicans were running for reelec tion, including the distinguished Sena tor  from Minnesota who  has  just  spoken.  So it was not an easy thing to do to  put  together a  package  that would  bring in $100 billion in revenue. It is  not easy in any event. But in this par ticular case, we did a series of things  which we thought brought about tax  fairness. Many people who had very  generous provisions in the Tax Code  now have a little less generous provi sions, and others who had not paid  much tax at all are getting the same  privilege that other Americans enjoy.  Then we did some  things on  the  compliance side, not just withholding  on dividend and interest income but  some other areas, and they are all con troversial. Nobody  should be under  any illusion. When you start making  changes, when you change the status  quo,  it becomes  very  controversial.  That  is particularly  true where you  have well-organized and well-financed  interest groups.  Some  of  our  testimony  indicates  that many people do not file returns  because they do not believe the system  is fair. They believe the system bene fits only upper-income Americans who  can shelter their income, and the wage  earners just keep paying and paying,  and they do pay most of the taxes.  Middle-income  taxpayers  bear  the  largest share of the tax burden. Many  in  the higher  incomes  can  shelter  those incomes and end up with a lower  share of taxation.  There  is a  feeling out  there  that  somehow the system is not fair. That  leads to a lot of discussion about flat  rate taxes and other ways to make the  system fair-elimination of certain de ductions and limited exemptions.  I must say that if there is this much  difficulty in trying to get tax compli ance, taxes collected that are already  due, I  think that about all anybody  can do on the flat rate tax is to make  speeches, because  it  is not going  to  happen.  We are not going to stand up here  and suggest, at least this Senator is  not, that we take away the mortgage  interest deduction or the medical de duction or the charitable deduction or  other deductions now authorized if we  first cannot make certain  that  the  taxes that are due are indeed paid.  Again, I fail to understand, from the  standpoint of tax policy how there can  be any doubt that the right course is  the one that we pursued, the one the  President supports.  Again I  indicate that the President  in his radio message on Saturday made  a clear and convincing case and indi cated also that he will veto any effort  to repeal this measure. That in itself I  think is encouraging. As a Republican  I believe many people felt  that the  President would not take on the bank ers or S&L executives or credit union  executives because  they were people  who are sometimes known as rich or  powerful. Some may say that this ad ministration caters to that group-it is  not an accurate perception-but it is  stated from time. So they may have  thought the President would back off  from  any  confrontation with  these  groups.  I would say, to the President's credit,  he met with three groups last week.  He met with bankers and others who  oppose this repeal, some who support  the repeal, and some in the business  community who  feel  it  is good  tax  policy and we should pursue it.  If we want to start unraveling what I  consider to be tax reform, tax fairness,  tax equity, tax compliance, tax collec tion, we  can make  that  judgment  starting tomorrow. I must say howev er,  that will not be  the end of the  debate, notwithstanding what happens  tomorrow.  I still believe that once this matter is  fully  explained  opinions  change.  I  traveled in my State, attended numer ous meetings  where  bankers  and  others were present. I was asked the  question about matching up  the re turns and all  these other questions  ",1983
474,597,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I am  strongly committed to balanced budg ets. I am willing to make the tough  choices involved in cutting back Feder al spending.  Furthermore, I strongly support ex ecutive branch and legislative branch  reforms that can mean balanced budg ets for years into the future.  It is clear that the current system  actually encourages increased Govern ment spending and  increased  taxes.  is  the  time  to eliminate  those  biases and help Congress keep a lid on  spending and taxes.  I rise today, Mr. President, to intro duce a bill that will do this. This legis lation proposes what I believe is the  correct way to impose constructive re straint  on  the  burgeoning Federal  budget.  This bill uses two basic procedures  to accomplish the objective of impos ing constructive restraint on the FedThis  eral budget: First, no deficit spending  could be enacted unless both Houses  of Congress have agreed to it by three fifths votes. Second, each Member of  Congress would be required to vote for  or against any  tax  increase greater  than the percentage  increase  in the  gross national product-including the  tax increases brought on by inflation.  In essence, the measure will insure  that Congress decisively confronts pro posed  increases  in Federal  taxation  and Federal spending.  My bill would require the submission  of an alternate budget if the adminis tration's proposed budget contains a  deficit. The submission of an alternate  budget is critical, since it would permit  Congress quickly and directly to con sider and evaluate the option of adopt ing a balanced budget.  Later, during consideration of any  concurrent budget resolution or con ference report on such a .resolution, a  second requirement is applied. If the  percentage of proposed Federal reve nues compared to the estimated gross  national product exceeds the percent age for the previous year, a separate  vote must be taken on the question of  whether the increase should be accept ed.  In  this manner, Congress will be  forced to address an issue of concern  to the taxpayers and the voters of this  country-the growth of Federal spend ing beyond growth in the economy.  Finally,  if Congress decides  to ap prove a deficit budget,  it can do so  under my proposal. But, a three-fifths  majority vote of both Houses would be  required. I believe this extraordinary  majority requirement properly places  the presumption in favor of a balanced  budget. It would still be possible to use  deficit spending if economic exigencies  required it. However, the burden of es tablishing the need for a budget out of  balance would be placed on its advo cates-not its opponents.  I am under no illusion that this leg islation will  solve  all our economic  problems. It will not. But, it represents  an important first step.  Congress must address the public's  demand for restraint on Government  spending and appropriately balanced  budgets. The huge deficit projected  for the coming fiscal year will keep in terest rates high, choking off econom ic recovery and economic growth. The  prospect  of  continued  record-high  deficits is a frightening one.  Adoption of this bill and the subse quent reduction of deficits would send  a clear signal  to business  that Con gress is serious about regaining control  over Federal spending.  Interest rates are the key to whether  or not the economy will recover. Bal ancing  the budget will help  insure  that interest rates stay down.  Last year, for instance, farmers paid  $22  billion  in  interest  costs, while  earning only $20 billion. There will be  no economic recovery until this trend  changes. Interest rates have also hurt  farm exports, and crippled the hous ing and timber industries.  The first step toward. getting inter est rates  to a  reasonable  level  is  to  reduce the Federal deficit. This bill is  a good step toward making the long term reductions that are needed.e  By Mr. MATHIAS:  S. 1078.

MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM FRANCHISE STABILITY ACT  OF 1983  In  e ",1983
475,597,7,Mr.  MATHIAS.,"  Mr.  President,  today  I  introduce a bill  that would  prevent the owner of a major league  sports team from moving the team to  another city unless one of several con ditions  is met, such as losing money  for 3 consecutive years. This bill would  protect not only the citizens of Balti more  from a possible move by  the  Colts, but all cities with professional  sports teams. People who live in these  cities have a deep emotional attach ment and a bona fide interest in the  local teams, and that must be recog nized and protected by the law. My  bill would cover all major league pro fessional team sports: football, basket ball, baseball, hockey and soccer.  For many years,  these teams have  enjoyed a preferred status under Fed eral antitrust laws, a status not shared  by  other American  businesses.  return for  this special consideration,  the owners have generally respected  the interests of the local community  and their dedicated fans.  Lately, however,  this self-restraint  has started  to weaken. We  all  saw  what  happened  to Oakland. Mter  years of sellout crowds, and after mil lions of dollars  in municipal  invest ment in stadium complexes and free ways, the owner moved the Raiders to  Los Angeles. Even the National Foot ball League could not stop him. No  one in Oakland would have been sur prised  if  the owner, on pulling out,  had barked the famous words of Wil liam Henry Vanderbilt-""The public  be damned.""  With this bill, I hope we can remind  the owners that they owe an obliga tion  to  their hometowns  that  tran scends their bottom line. When a team  abandons its ""home city,"" serious eco nomic and social dislocation occurs,  and we need more effective means to  protect the local interest than we now  have.  Under my bill, a major league team  that has been located in one city for 6  or more years cannot be moved to an",1983
476,610,7,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President, as a  member of the advisory board of the  American University here in Washing ton, I consider it a privilege to be asso ciated with  its young and dynamic  president, Dr. Richard Berendzen.  Recently, while speaking before a  group of senior honor students, Dr.  Berendzen  reflected on  four  signifi cant lessons he learned while obtain ing his B.S. from Massachusetts Insti tute of Technology, and his M.A. and  Ph. D. from Harvard University. His  message to these young leaders of to morrow  is  timeless,  impressive,  and  thought provoking. It is a message not  only for our youth, but for us all-one  which can serve  to  remind us  that  through education we should obtain  the knowledge and wisdom to become  productive members of this society.  I am sure my colleagues will be in terested  in Dr. Berendzen's remarks  and I ask that they be printed in the  RECORD.  MAN OF THE YEAR FOR 1983: EDUCATED,  CARING PERSONS  <By Richard Berendzen)  Congratulations,  members  of Mortar  Board! By virture of being in this society,  you have demonstrated achievement at the  college  level.  Soon,  your  undergraduate  classes, papers, and exams will end. But in  these few words, I should like to return to  that education.  Before doing so, however, I wonder as you  read this if you know what time it is. Do  you know for certain what ""1983"" means?  You might say it is 1,983 years since the  birth of Christ. No, He was born about six  years before that. And He wasn't born on  December 25th or even on January 1st;  rather, he probably was born in the spring.  What precisely is a year? I am writing this  in January. Why does  January have 31  days? Isn't a month related to the moon?  Yet it takes the moon only 28 days to orbit  the earth, not 31. Why, by the way, are  there 12 months in a year? Wouldn't it be  more orderly to have a 10-month year, in a  decimal system? How can one month have  28 days and another 31? And what, exactly,  is a day? For that matter, what  is  time  itself? We make time, measure time,  take  time, spend  time, waste  time; we all  talk  comfortably about time, as if we know what  it is. But what, in fact, is time?  In short, are you-a senior honor stu dent-certain you actually know how to tell  time? And if you don't even know that, how  do you expect to succeed in life beyond col lege?  Almost everyone-whether student or ex perienced professional-take commonplace  things for granted.  LESSON NUMBER 1: You always have  more to learn. Wisdom comes not in what  you learn but in the realization of what you  have yet to learn.  As you may have guessed, my own profes sional field is astronomy. I'd now like to give  you a short riddle. Read it carefully.  ""What is the beginning of eternity,  The end of time and space;  The beginning of every end,  The end of every place?""  It is the letter e.  Lesson Number 2: Sometimes the answer  lies right before us, if only we could notice  and not be misled. The mark of the truly  educated person is not so much the ability  to penetrate the unknowable as it is to rec ognize and understand the knowable.  Now, let me give you an old proverb.  ""He who knows not and knows not that he  knows not, he is a fool. Shun him.  He who knows not and knows he knows  not, he is simple. Teach him.  He who knows and knows not he knows,  he is asleep. Wake him.  He who knows and knows he knows, he is  wise. Follow him.""  Lesson Number 3: Do not confuse words  for wisdom, pomposity for profundity. In  pretentiousness, this proverb awesomely re sembles modern rhetoric-from government  manuals to political speeches, from business  reports to scholarly tomes-except it is more  elegant and less pedantic than they often  are. At  least  it has no  ""points-in-time,""  ""interfaces,"" ""bottom  lines,""  ""prioritizes,""  or ""inputs.""  If you have things to say and genuinely  wish to say them, you can do so unequivo cally.  In this essay, I'd like to say some things  directly.  Sad to say, during much of your lifetime,  our nation-the nation I hold dear-has, by  many demonstrable measures declined.  By many measures, we have lost our re solve. We demand  little of ourselves and  accept  the  result. Our productivity slips.  Our work ethic plummets.  What is needed-not only in higher educa tion but in all of education, not only in edu cation but in all of American life-is a re dedication to a personal, institutional, and  even national sense of pride. When profes sions become only jobs, when mediocrity re places meritocracy, when today towers over  tomorrow,  then gradually,  inexorably,  the  foundation for self-respect deteriorates.  To assign blame and find solutions,  the  search need not go far. We collectively, have  lost confidence to demand excellence of our  nation and even of ourselves.  Schools alone can not teach rudiments of  civil living, respect for knowledge, apprecia tion of creatively, self-discipline-in short,  attributes that should be learned first in the  home.  In  today's rapidly evolving,  increasingly  complex world, many of our guiding social  institutions have diminished in significance.  Without doubt, one of the most poignant of  these declines has been in the role of the  family.  I  lament not a  changing  family  structure, but a weakening family responsi bility.  And, at the epicenter-more fundamental  than standards or work ethic, than pride or  even family-lies the singular concept that  home and family  teach best:  love.  In our  modern, chic world,  let us not fear to ac knowledge this basic human need.  You soon will not just graduate; you will  assume a  responsibility-literally,  to help  the nation be what it can be and should be.  To do so, however, you must be concerned  with more  than  just yourself.  In  recent  years,  the national economy has changed  many students' motivations. The humble  learner and  fledgling  scholar have given  way to the questioning consumer and future  job-seeker. And many students have come,  not for education but for certification. The  Wizard of Oz did not give the scarecrow a  brain; he gave what was perhaps more  useful-a diploma. Past satire has foreshad owed current reality.  In it most deliciously cynical form,  the  mandate of ""relevance  in education"" has  ",1983

486,662,7,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before  the House, H.R. 1723, would extend  for 3 years the current authorizations  for the acquisition of three national  wildlife refuges. These refuges include:  Great  Dismal  Swamp,  Minnesota  Valley, and San Francisco Bay. In ad dition, amendments to the bill offered  during subcommittee markup would  increase the authorization for appro priations for land acquisition and de velopment  at  the  Great  Dismal  Swamp and the Minnesota Valley Na tional Wildlife Refuges.  The three refuges being considered  for reauthorization today are worthy  components of the National Wildlife  Refuge System. In addition to conserv ing  important wildlife  species  and  their habitats, these refuges provide a  much needed wildlife-oriented public  use area as well as interpretation and  educational programs  to  inform  the  public of the importance of maintain ing fiSh and wildlife resources. Great  Dismal Swamp, for example, is an ex tensive  forested wetland  and  lake  system in Virginia and North Carolina  which provides habitat for abundant  fish and wildlife populations. It is par ticularly noted  for  its unusual bird  populations with over 75 species nest ing in the swamp. The Fish and Wild life Service estimates that a  total of  113,000  acres will  be  necessary  to  insure conservation of the area. The  cost of the remaining lands would re quire an increase in the amount of the  authorization to $22 million in order  to complete acquisition of the refuge.  In addition, the projected habitat im provement  and public use  develop ment needs necessary to maintain the  quality of wildlife habitat and to pro vide wildlife education and recreation  to the public will also require an in crease  in authorization to $12.1 mil lion. H.R. 1723, as amended in subcom mittee, would  increase  the develop ment and acquisition authorizations  for Great Dismal Swamp  to  these  levels.  The Minnesota  Valley  National  Wildlife Refuge  contains  extensive  marshlands  that are known  for  the  vast populations of waterfowl which  rely upon them for production, migra tion, and wintering grounds. Approxi mately 2,850  acres of private  lands  remain  to  be  acquired within  the  refuge. The estimated cost of  these  lands is approximately $12 million, ex ceeding  the  current  authorization  level by $10.4 million. H.R. 1723 would  raise the authorization for land acqui sition to this level.  Development  of  the  interpretive  center and other facilities recommend ed by the master plan for the Minne sota Valley NWR has been delayed be cause no  funds have been appropri ated. Due  to  inflation,  the cost of  building the center will be higher than  originally anticipated. The proposed  legislation as amended  increases  the  authorization for development from $6  million to $9.8 million.  H.R. 1723, as amended, does not re authorize the establishment of Sailors'  Snug Harbor as a National Wildlife  Refuge. A  study completed by  the  Heritage Conservation and Recreation  Service concluded that Sailors' Snug  Harbor is an area of local and State  significance and recommended that it  be congressionally deauthorized. The  area has not been donated to the De partment of the Interior as the origi nal  legislation  authorized.  Instead,  Sailors' Snug Harbor has continued to  function successfully as a community  environmental education and cultural  center under the management of Snug  Harbor Cultural Center, Inc., a public  nonprofit corporation.  In summary, Mr. Speaker, these ref uges being considered for reauthoriza tion today not only provide habitat for  wildlife, but also,  because of  their  proximity to large population centers,  provide millions of citizens the oppor tunity to develop a greater apprecia tion of the importance of wildlife. If  we are to continue our support for the  preservation of these important refuge  areas,  an  increase  of  authorization  levels  and extension  through  fiscal  year 1986 is necessary. I urge my col leagues to join me in supporting this  bill.  Mr .. FORSYTHE. Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1723 will extend the  authorization period for the Great Dis mal Swamp, Minnesota Valley, and San  Francisco Bay National Wildlife Ref uges for 3 years. In addition, the authori zation  for  appropriations  for  land  acquisition and development at Great  Dismal Swamp and Minnesota Valley  would be increased to reflect increased  costs resulting from inflation and the  delays brought on by the use of a ""will ing-seller"" policy, unavoidable delays in  settlement, and  lower  than planned  appropriation requests. The additional  acquisition  and  development  funds  will provide not only valuable direct  benefits, but in most cases are neces sary  to protect or effectively utilize  the habitat already acquired. No addi tional acreage has been authorized.  All  three of  these refuges provide  extremely valuable waterfowl habitat  as well as habitat for a diverse popula tion of fish, wildlife, and plant species.  All are also within easy driving dis tance  of major metropolitan  areas  and,  therefore, provide a much en hanced accessability  to our national  resources for millions of people.  I concur with the assessment of the  gentleman from Louisiana, that these  refuges should be authorized with suf ficient additional funding to carry out  the remaining acquisition and develop ment needs and therefore urge my col leagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.  M.:. BREAUX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the distinguished chairman  of the full committee, the gentleman  from North Carolina <Mr. JoNES).  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1723,  a  bill  to  authorize  appropriations  through fiscal year 1986 for the Great  Dismal Swamp, Minnesota Valley, and  San Francisco Bay National Wildlife  Refuges.  In addition to extending the author ization for  these three refuges until  September 30,  1986, H.R.  1723  in creases the authorization levels for ap propriations  for  the Great Dismal  Swamp and Minnesota Valley National  Wildlife Refuges. In testimony before  the Subcommittee on Fisheries and  Wildlife Conservation and  the Envi ronment, the Department of the Inte rior indicated that these increases in  authorization levels are necessary  to  complete land acquisition and develop ment of these refuges to the extent  originally intended by Congress. How ever,  the administration currently  is  not requesting an increase in such au thorization levels. If an increase in au",1983

488,688,7,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to join my distinguished and eloquent  and  compassionate  colleagues,  the  gentleman from Ohio and the gentle man  from Connecticut,  in  talking  about  this  rule and using  this rule  time to talk about what could become  the worst bill of this session.  I  rise, as did  the gentleman from  Ohio, to reluctantly support the rule,  but to point out to the House the need  for an open rule and the reason that  we are going to have to have extended  debate, as we should have had in the  past on  this bill. The amendments,  and I  found 14 of them filed  today  under this open rule, with amendment  after amendment, will point out con clusively to the Members of this House  and the American public the inherent  flaws of this bill.  Frankly, I am optimistic that at the  conclusion of debate, and whether the  debate ends today or sometime later, I  am optimistic that this House upon  reading the bill and realizing what this  legislation does to hurt people in this  country, that this House in a biparti san display of good sense will, in fact,  defeat  this  legislation. Even better,  this House should support and adopt  the Wylie amendment, which would  put into law the forbearance that the  regulatory agencies desperately need.  the gentleman from Connecticut  stated, that forbearance law could be  implemented and enacted today and  put into  the law by next week and  begin helping people immediately.  The open rule is needed. I count 14  amendments, 14 amendments that will  seek to try to clean up this bill if, in  fact, it can be cleaned up, 14 amend ments that will probably make some  As  improvements,  including  to  provide  that we use existing remedies under  existing law in chapter 13,  including  that we would use forbearance,  that  we would  just simply  target  this  to  those most in need and in unemploy ment; but the essential flaw of this  legislation cannot be cleaned up by  amendment. That  flaw  in  this bill  would  tell every financial  institution  in America that if you forbear, and  provide  partial  payments  and  give  homeowners a chance to get back on  their feet, then the financial institu tion would not get paid, but if this bill  passes and  the  financial  institution  does not forbear, but forecloses,  in stead,  the U.S. Government would  make those mortgage payments for 3  years and  the  institution would get  paid. In short, with the passage of this  bill, a financial institution would not  be paid if the institution forbears, but  would be paid if the institution fore closes. Thus would be created a cruel  irony, a powerful  incentive  to  fore close.  0 1420  If this bill passes the financial insti tution is  told all you have  to do  to  foreclose, all you have to do  to get  your money is to get paid and the Fed eral Government will pay the financial  institution that mortgage payment for  3 years, 36 months, no questions are  asked. But only for  the first 76,000  that would  foreclose,  and  I would  submit to my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle that you would see the  fastest, the largest, the most depress ing, and the cruelest stampede to fore closures  that  this Nation has  ever  seen.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983

The Chair appoints the gentleman  from Oregon <Mr. AuCoiN) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.  IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  Accordingly  the  House  resolved  itself  into  the Committee  of  the  Whole House on  the State of  the  Union  for consideration of  the bill  <H.R. 1983) to amend certain housing  and community development laws to  provide  emergency mortgage  assist ance  to homeowners and emergency  shelter  for  the homeless, with Mr.  AuCoiN in the chair.

493,688,7,Mr. MINISH.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R. 1983, the Emergen cy Housing Assistance Act. This legis lation represents a plea on the part of  the American people; it is a plea for  Congress  to act decisively to protect  the most fundamental possession this  society  affords  its members,  their  home. This is an issue upon which this  body cannot afford to equivocate or be  hesitant. We must answer the cries of  Americans about to lose their homes  through foreclosure and vote to pass  this bill.  H.R. 1983 responds directly to condi tions which  are  the  result of  the  severe  economic  recession  that has  gripped  this country for  the past 2  years. To  qualify  for  assistance,  a  homeowner would  have  to  demon strate that the inability to make mort gage payments resulted from a sub stantial loss of income due to circum stances beyond their control. This bill  does not make assistance available to  households  where  irresponsibility  leads  to default on mortgage pay ments. Instead, it is reactive to an un employment  rate  which  currently  stands above 10 percent and a mort gage default rate which has risen to  2.36 percent.  Some Members are inclined to point  to statistics recently released by vari ous Government agencies which indi cate that our economic downturn may  be abating, and suggest that there is  no  longer a need for an emergency  mortgage relief program. While it is  certainly the hope of all of us in this  Chamber that this country will soon  experience a  time of economic pros perity, we should not lose sight of the  fact that recovery will be a slow proc ess and that the people who are losing  their mortgages need help now.  If this Congress is truly committed  to assisting homeowners to keep their  homes, we should show no reluctance  in authorizing  the appropriation of  the relatively modest sum of $760 mil lion necessary to establish the emer gency loan fund. By passing this bill,  this Congress would be giving a sign of  good faith to the American people. We  would  be  showing  them  that,  by  making 18-month emergency mortgage  ",1983

496,701,7,Mr. BARTLETT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  to oppose  this bill vociferously  and strongly for all of the reasons that  have been discussed so far and, fur ther, to try to bring into focus many  of the arguments in almost the endless  list of what is wrong with this legisla tion. And,  first,  let me say-and  I  think we all know it-both sides on  this on both sides of the aisle and both  sides on the committee want truly to  help people who need help and who  are being foreclosed on and who are  unemployed. The problem with  this  legislation is that this is purported to  be legislation that is in fact a bundle  of  campaign  speeches  and  slogans  made into law that would in fact hurt  the very people that we are trying to  help.  Let me go down point by point: This  bill  has  been  characterized,  and  I  think aptly so, and will be character ized by  the American public when  they begin to see it, as ""The Foreclo sure Incentive Act of 1983,"" because  this bill, in and of itself, would cause  vastly  increased numbers of foreclo sures in this country, foreclosures that  otherwise would not happen.  Just look at the facts. In 1982, there  were 1.2 million home mortgages that  were delinquent, and yet fewer than  60,000 foreclosures that resulted in the  loss of a home. So we have a potential,  we are building in a huge profit incen tive for financial institutions to fore close and to go into process up to 1.2  million delinquencies. The potential of  foreclosure  is almost 10  times more,  more than 10 times, as a result of this  legislation.  This bill could aptly be called the  Foreclosure Incentive Act of 1983.  And, second, this bill is in fact a new  kind of giant entitlement program, but  not a means-tested entitlement pro gram. This is an entitlement program  with no assets test, with no test as to  liquid assets, a Mercedes or automo biles or lakefront  lots or condomin iums or other assets that the borrower  might have, but in fact is an entitle ment program for the rich.  I would just urge my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to read the  bill, to read the bill when it states that  you do not even have  to be unem ployed, you can be underemployed, be",1983

499,714,7,Mr. MITCHELL.," I thank my chair man for yielding. I guess I am trying  to offer a compromise, which is most  un-Mitchell-like.  But it just seems to me that if we  say our objective is to complete within  7 hours,  there would be an under standing that if we do not complete  within 7 hours we keep on going until  we do, and that just seems a reasona ble approach. Would you have any ob jection to that?  ",1983

504,714,7,Mr. BETHUNE.," I just want to make  one final point and then I  think we  can put this aside, because I think the  gentleman  from Maryland has pre sented a sensible alternative to resolv ing the issue forever and ever right  now We need to have targets like that.  That is good.  The point I was making, and I think  it is a good one, which I think is being  recognized here, is that if you want to  limit debate to 7 hours, you could get  a rule to that effect, and in that fash ion  the mechanism  of  the House  would have a  chance  to work, and  everybody's rights would be protected.  You could go  through  that sort of  process which is available to you and,  in fact, you could make it a closed bill  if you wanted to.  The CHAIRMAN.

512,714,7,Mr. GONZALEZ., Glad to yield.  ,1983
513,714,7,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like to add one other thought to the  debate. What concerns me  in part  about this suggestion is  that we are  now  considering  the bill,  open  for  amendment, section by section, and  there are those of us who feel very  strongly that some of the amendments  pending are not in fact dilatory but  are meritorious. It is possible  if we  have  some  understanding  as  to  a  period of limitation of debate, that if  the debate consumes that period, then  those of us who might have amend ments in later sessions would be pre cluded. I submit to the gentleman that  that is a serious concern about a pre liminary agreement on debate limita tion.  ",1983
514,714,7,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Chairman,  I  think from what the gentleman from  Ohio has explained, after the gentle man from Arkansas explained himself,  that that is reasonable, understanding  enough.  I do not think it would be reasonable  to go beyond that. So, I accept that.  As I see it and expect it, I do not think  that if we start promptly, say at the  usual  time-1, 1:30 p.m.-that by 8  p.m. anybody would be in a position  where he had been shut off from the  opportunity of offering amendments,  assuming we do not have willful at tempts to obstruct.  ",1983
515,714,7,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I want to commend  the able Member  from Texas <Mr.  GoNZALEZ) for sponsoring this legisla tion.  If you look out over this country,  and see how many homes have been  lost under  foreclosure,  people have  been taken away from the altars of  their family because of economic con ditions for which they are not respon sible, you can appreciate  the impor tance and the meaning of legislation  like this.  I think the record shows that under  the present economic conditions that  we have there are more mortgage fore closures than there have been at any  time since the Great Depression.  We have had more bankruptcies and  I  believe more  farm  foreclosures.  I  think this administration, and if we do  not do something about it, this Con gress is delinquent in not having given  greater assistance to the people of this  country against those conditions than  we have done so far.  And I base that upon the experience  that this country had in the New Deal  days. President Roosevelt was respon sible  for  the  establishment of  the  Home Owners Loan Corporation. And  I know, because I was in the Senate at  that  time,  that  that  organization  saved  thousands of homes  for  the  people of this country.  Maybe you have never had a home  sold  under  foreclosure, which  you  owned, where you had the family sen timents  so  embedded, but you can  imagine what it meant to all of those  people who have had  their homes  foreclosed away from them.  During  the New Deal  days,  the  Home Owners Loan Corporation not  only saved thousands of homes for the  people of this country but it made a  great profit upon what it did.  Only a few evenings ago I met Mr.  Brownstein, who was head of the FHA  in those days. I asked him how much  he thought the Home Owners Loan  Corporation netted in profit from its  operations during those days.

516,740,7,Mr. FORD.," Mr. President, during  the consideration of the Staggers Rail  Act of 1980, Congress sought to help  the railroads recover their inflationary  cost with minimal regulatory interven tion. Automatic increases in the Stag gers Act replaced the time-consuming  general  rate  increase  proceedings  which were  characteristic  prior  to  1980. As stated in the Senate Report  on the Staggers Act:  The railroads' financi.al difficulties may be  attributed, in part, to the time lag involved  in  recovering cost  increases. This section  will help assure that rail rates reflect a car rier's  current  costs  by  adding  a  new  subsection . . . to provide a  zone of  rate  freedom for adjustments not in excess of  the  carrier's  increased  costs ... <Senate  Report No. 96-470, pp. 19-20).  Section 203  of  the act, 49 U.S.C.  10707a,  states  that  the  Interstate  Commerce Commission shall publish a  ""rail cost adjustment factor"" at least  quarterly as a basis for a zone of rail  rate flexibility  for  individual carrier  rate changes. The section specifically  states:  10707a(a)(2)(B)-Commencing with  the  fourth quarter of 1980,  the Commission  shall, as often as practicable but in no event  less often than quarterly, publish a rail cost  adjustment factor which shall be a fraction,  the numerator of which is the latest pub lished Index of Railroad Costs <which index  shall be compiled or verified by the Com mission, with appropriate adjustments to re flect the changing composition of railroad  costs, including the quality and mix of ma terial and labor) and the denominator of  which  is  the same  index  for  the fourth  quarter of 1980 ...  At no  time during the drafting of  the Staggers Act did the sponsors ever  envision a situation where the cost-of living rate would decrease instead of  increase,  since  the act was drafted  during an economic period when infla tion was  rising  steadily. Therefore,  section 203  is silent on the issue of  rate decreases when there is a reduc tion in inflationary costs from the pre viously published rail cost adjustment  factor. Today, due to various causes,  some  railroad costs are actually de creasing. The legislation that I am in troducing today will remedy this situa tion.  Pursuant to the mandate of section  203 of the Staggers Act, the Commis sion adopted a  cost  recovery  index  which measures the changes in the av erage price of goods and services pur chased by the railroads  in providing  transportation services, Ex Parte No.  290 <Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost Recov ery Procedures, 364 I.C.C. 841 (1981).  Thereafter, the Commission published  an index of costs by which railroads  may multiply their rates on a quarter ly basis. Rates increased by the cost  index are immune from challenge on  reasonableness grounds.  The Commission's decision  in Ex  Parte No. 290 <Sub-No. 2), supra, was  affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia on May 4,  1982. On April 19, 1982, the Commis sion ordered the proceeding reopened.  In that April 19, 1982, decision, the  Commission denied a petition for a de claratory order on decreases  in  the  index. This request was filed by the  National  Industrial Traffic League.  The Commission  stated  the  section  203 of the Staggers Act did not appear  to contemplate reductions, nor did the  Commission's Ex Parte No. 290 <Sub No. 2) rules.  ",1983
517,753,7,Mr. JACKSON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with a number of my  colleagues  today  in  introducing  the  Outdoor Recreation Resources Review  Commission Act of 1983.  In 1958, the Congress enacted legis lation establishing an Outdoor Recrea tion Resources Review Commission  <ORRRC). The ORRRC was charged  with reviewing  the Nation's outdoor  recreation resources, both existing and  potential, and directed to make recom mendations to the President and the  Congress about the nature of these re sources and about what outdoor recre ation-related policies should be adopt ed.  To say that the ORRRC report pre sented to the Congress in 1962 had a  significant impact on the Nation's out door recreation policy would be a con siderable understatement. Such land mark pieces of legislation as the Land  and Water Conservation Fund,  the  Historic Preservation Fund, the Wil derness  Act,  the  National  Trails  System Act, and the Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act were strongly influenced by  or were a direct result of the ORRRC  report.  In August 1982, under the leadership  of Laurance Rockefeller, the Outdoor  Recreation Policy Review Group was  formed  to  assess  the  present  and  future status of outdoor recreation in  America  20  years  after ORRRC.  Among other things, the review group  found that there has been a period of  great social and economic change in  the two decades since ORRRC. Yet, in  spite of these changes, or perhaps be cause of them, outdoor recreation is  more important in American life now  than  it was  in 1962.  In response  to  these and other findings,  the review  group has recommended that a new  ORRRC be created by an act of Con gress to reconsider outdoor recreation  policy and programs in America. The  legislation we are  introducing  today  implements this recommendation.  The Commission  is  to  consist of  eight Members of Congress-two mem bers from each party from both the  House and the Senate-and seven citi zens appointed by the President of the  United States. The Commission is to  prepare  a  comprehensive  review  of  outdoor  recreation  resources  in  the  United States and submit it along with  policy recommendations to the Presi dent  and  the Congress within  18  months. The  legislation would  also  create an advisory council to assist the  Commission and to encourage as much  public involvement in this process as  possible. Hopefully these new findings  and recommendations will be as  in formative and useful to present policy makers as they were to the Congress  and the American public 20 years ago.  Mr. President, I want to emphasize  that my support for this legislation to  reassess the Nation's outdoor recrea tion resources  in no way should be  viewed a sign of dissatisfaction with  the programs and policies emanating  from the original ORRRC. We can re assess  and  reevaluate  existing  pro grams and policies in light of new cir cumstances without starting over. This  new effort should update and build on  these earlier findings, not seek to re pudiate them.  As the only member of the original  ORRRC still  in the Congress,  I am  proud to be associated with this pro posal. My friend Laurance Rockefeller,  Chairman of the original Commission,  is to be commended for initiating this  effort through the formation of the  policy review group. Likewise, Senator  WALLOP, chairman of the Public Lands  and Reserved Water Subcommittee to  be congratulated for taking the lead in  bringing  this  legislation before  the  Congress in an expeditious manner.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the summary of the Outdoor  Recreation and Policy Review Group's  report appear in the REcoRD at this  point.  There being no objection, the sum mary was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  SUMMARY 1  In 1962 the Outdoor Recreation Resources  Review Commission <ORRRC> submitted a  report to the President and Congress which  has been instrumental in guiding national  outdoor recreation policy for the past two  decades. Since that time, the nation has un dergone major social and economic changes.  While there have been significant increases  in the supply of outdoor recreation opportu nities, there have also been tremendous in creases in outdoor recreation participation  and major changes in the kinds of outdoor  recreation desired.  The nation is confronting serious econom ic problems which must be solved. Even in  these difficult times, outdoor recreation is  important, in our view more than ever, for  three reasons:  1. As an integral part of American life, it  is a continuing source of national vitality,  an important factor at a time when individ uals  and  society must  adjust  to  rapid  change.  2. As a major component of the national  economy, outdoor  recreation can provide  jobs and contribute to the nation's economic  recovery.  3. Providing outdoor recreation resources  contributes to solving environmental quality  problems-such as protecting wilderness and  controlling air and water pollution.  However, for the past three or four years,  government programs at all levels have been  reduced. In 1981, the federal agency recom mended by ORRRC  to provide national  leadership  in outdoor  recreation was dis1 Outdoor Recreation for America-1983: An as sessment twenty years after the report of the Out door Recreation Resources Review Comission.  mantled and funding for recreation land ac quisition  deferred. Programs  deemed  no  longer appropriate have not been yet re placed with initiatives to meet continuing  needs. Changes in society and the continu ing importance of outdoor recreation make  it important to consider ways of developing  responses to present problems and to new  and unexpected developments.  While the report that follows is not an in depth study of the status of outdoor recrea tion today, it is an assessment of the present  situation and potential need based on the  collective judgment of seven individual vol unteers who have experience  in outdoor  recreation policy,  resources management,  and business.  In the course of its deliberations, this Out door Recreation Policy Review Group ar rived at the following eight findings.  1. The two decades since ORRRC submit ted its report have been a period of great  social and economic change.  2. Changes  in how and where we  live,  work, and play have had a profound effect  on outdoor recreation.  3. Despite the changes over the past 20  years, or perhaps because of them, outdoor  recreation is more important in American  life than it was in 1962.  4. Governments in general are doing less  for outdoor recreation than is required to  meet the need.  5. The  role of  the  federal government  needs  to be reassessed, redefined, and re vived.  6. The private sector  is providing more  outdoor recreation than it did 20 years ago;  it could do even more with government co operation.  7. There are ways in which outdoor recre ation could be provided to meet increased  demands that would not require huge public  expense.  8. There is a need for improved informa tion as  the basis  for outdoor  recreation  planning and management.  The Policy Review Group urges  that a  new Outdoor Recreation Resources Review  Commission be established by act of Con gress as the original ORRRC was. The com mission should embody the characteristics  of ORRRC: bipartisan membership, strong  congressional participation, a full range of  interests represented, and an independent  staff.  The mandate of  the  new  commission  should  be  broader  than  the  original  ORRRC. It cannot ignore the interrelation ships and overlaps of outdoor  recreation  with many indoor activities associated with  physical fitness. A new study also must rec ognize that outdoor recreation is related to  other leisure time activities. Further, out door recreation is linked, in ways that have  not been adequately researched, to such fac tors as job satisfaction and productivity, and  family and social cohesion. Urban recrea tion also  requires  further attention. The  link between outdoor recreation, environ mental quality, and resources management  also  should be considered. However,  the  focus of the new ORRRC's work should be  on the interaction of people and outdoor re sources.  In recommending the establishment of a  new commission to consider outdoor recrea tion policy and programs, we are not neces sarily seeking to resuscitate old programs,  but rather to develop initiatives to meet out door  recreation  needs  now  and  in  the  future.  While not developing the agenda for the  new commission, the Policy Review Group  ",1983
518,766,7,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  am pleased  to  introduce a  series of  bills to provide for comprehensive au thorization of  the National Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  <NOAA) by the Commerce Committee.  NOAA was  created by Executive  order in 1970 with the primary respon sibility for most of the Federal Gov ernment's civilian  research,  service  and regulatory programs affecting the  Nation's oceans and atmosphere. The  functions of NOAA are critical for effi cient weather  forecasting  and  the  sound and productive management of  the Nation's ocean and  coastal  re sources.  Last year the committee introduced  a single NOAA omnibus authorization  bill. While that bill also achieved our  goal of a comprehensive authorization  program for NOAA, it failed due to a  number  of  jurisdictional  problems.  Those problems have now been  re solved and it is my hope that the new  approach we are using this year will  enable the package to pass both the  Senate and the House. As with last  year, this approach also achieves the  major goal of the committee regarding  NOAA:  to bring all of NOAA under  active authorization for the first time.  Four new NOAA authorization bills  are  included  in  the package. They  cover  the 85 percent of  the agency  which currently falls under standing  budget authority. The other 15 per cent of the agency will remain under  separate expiring authorizations.  The  four  new  authorization  bills  cover programs within all four of the  NOAA budget areas:  First, atmosphere and satellite programs;  Second, ocean and coastal programs;  Third, marine fishery programs; and  Fourth, NOAA program support.  In addition to these four new bills  there are two others which complete  the package for fiscal year 1984. These  two reauthorize the following:  First,  the marine sanctuaries pro gram; and  Second, three miscellaneous fishery  acts.  These bills, combined with the other  NOAA authorizations already on the  books,  brings  100  percent  of  the  NOAA budget within the annual reau thorization and oversight process.  Also  included  in  this package  of  NOAA authorization bills is a reauth orizaiton  for  three expiring  fishery  acts. These  acts  are  the National  Aquaculture Act,  the Atlantic Tunas  ",1983
519,779,7,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  Dr. Robert E. Weintraub,  a  senior  economist  for  the  Joint Economic  Committee, has  just published  the  first of a three-part study of U.S. bank  lending to LDC's and Eastern bloc na tions  entitled  ""International Debt:  Crisis and Challenge."" In my estima tion, this paper deserves the full atten tion of my colleagues and their staffs  as Congress prepares to debate there quest for an $8.5 billion bailout of the  International Monetary Fund.  Dr. Weintraub  systematically  re views the origins of the current debt  crunch, the ability of the LDC's and  the banks  to honor  their  commit ments,  the nature of  the doomsday  scenarios involving the collapse of the  international monetary system should  widespread  debt  repudiation  occur,  and the likely impact of current ad ministration  proposals  for  dealing  with the debt problem. In essence, Dr.  Weintraub concludes that, first, a re viving world economy will improve the  export position of  troubled debtors  and thus significantly reduce their bal ance-of-payments  difficulties,  and  second,  that the realities of interna tional  banking  and  our  regulatory  system do not support the theory of  widespread bank failures should de faults occur.  The particular portion of this study  to which I would like to direct the at tention of my colleagues  today, Mr.  President, is the final chapter of Dr.  Weintraub's study. In it, he critiques  the current administration policy for  defusing the debt bomb and finds it  lacking in many respects. In particu lar, Dr. Weintraub finds that an in crease in IMF and GAB resources is  both unnecessary and possibly coun terproductive to significant long-term  economic reforms by troubled debtors.  He then proceeds to elucidate an alter native set of policy recommendations  involving the promotion of real, nonin flationary economic growth in the in dustrialized nations and  the LDC's,  necessary adjustments on the part of  bankers who made the bad loans in  the first place, and the willingness of  central  banks  and  governments  to  ",1983
520,818,7,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, there  has been a great deal of discussion  generated concerning  the  feasibility  and desirability of a space-based anti missile system as a result of President  Reagan's March 23 speech. One such  plan, which has gained wide attention,  is called High Frontier. It is my opin ion  that  this  concept  is  extremely  shortsighted and has many flaws. The  costs together with the many strategic  and  technical drawbacks make High  Frontier  impractical-and  an  idea  which should be soundly rejected.  For the benefit of my colleagues, I  submit in the REcoRD a brief-but con cise-critique of  the High Frontier  proposal which has been prepared by  the Center for Defense Information. It  is an excellent summary which de serves careful attention.  THE HIGH FRONTIER PROPOSAL: A CDI  CRITIQUE  The Center for Defense Information has  completed an analysis of the High Frontier  concept of space-based defense against bal listic missiles. The results of the study are  set forth in the following critique:  The High Frontier proposal for a Global  Ballistic Missile Defense <GBMD>  system  claims that it would < 1 > negate the Soviet  nuclear threat; (2) assure the survival of the  U.S. population; and (3) secure space for  commercial development.  The High Frontier project initially calls  for space-based missile defense and ground based point defense <a short-range defense  of missile  silos),  to be augmented by a  second tier or space-based defense <possibly  employing  laser weaponry),  an extensive  civil  defense program,  advanced manned  military space vehicles, and more.  The architect of High Frontier, Lt. Gener al Daniel Graham <USA-Ret.), former Direc tor of  the Defense  Intelligence Agency,  claims that the initial system can be de ployed using ""off  the shelf  technology"",  within 5-6 years, and at a ""reasonable cost""  of $40 billion.  These High Frontier claims are evaluated  as follows:  TECHNOLOGY  Technology for a space-based ballistic mis sile defense deployment does not exist. De spite decades of U.S. efforts, there are seri ous doubts that the simpler task of ground based  point  defense  of  ICBMs  can  be  achieved, especially against relatively cheap  and easy Soviet countermeasures. The High  Frontier's claims of existing ""off the shelf  technology"" have been debunked by Reagan  administration officials.

521,831,7,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to bring  to the attention of my colleagues and  their staffs the work of the League of  Federal Recreation Associations,  Inc.  The league provides a host of services  and information used by Federal em ployees and retirees, and its members  organize activities that include tourna ment play in a great variety of sports,  summer picnics, holiday parties, and  health fairs.  Twenty-three  years  ago,  Govern ment recreation and welfare groups  decided  to pool  their  ideas and ex change information on a Government wide basis, and the league was found ed. Today, it serves 85 member organi zations in the Washington metropoli tan area and offers a host of services  to over 250,000 employees.  I have been particularly impressed  by league initiatives that encourage in dividual  self-help. League  organiza tions arrange seminars and  training  programs on topics such as financial  management, health care, and stress  control. Organizations also help point  employees toward appropriate educa tional opportunities  that employees  need and want. The  league under writes  its efforts as an  information  network/assistance network by utiliz ing volunteers who give generously of  their time, through membership dues,  and by retaining minimal profits from  sales.  Mr. Speaker, the League of Federal  Recreation Associations clearly adds  an important dimension to the Federal  workplace that is more needed than  ever. At a time when job satisfaction  and morale have declined throughout  Government, the league provides con structive  outlets  and  opportunities  that employees need and want.  I would urge my colleagues and their  staffs to get in touch with league rep resentatives and acquaint  themselves  with its programs, which, by the way,  are also available to Government em ployees who work on Capitol Hill. If  Members are as  impressed with the  league's work as I have been, they may  want to provide support by encourag ing Federal facilities to provide assist ance and space to the league's many  organizations and programs. This valu able  family  of organizations works  without any Government funding, and  yet, as I have said, makes a direct con tribution  to  the quality of Federal  service.  If you wish  to contact the league,  please address correspondence to the  League of Federal Recreation AssociaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tions, Inc., P.O.

Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to draw the attention of my  colleagues to the accomplishments of  an outstanding hospital in my home town  and  congressional  district  in  Nassau County, N.Y.  Twenty years ago, Franklin General  Hospital was established by a group of  physicians as a 146-bed private hospi tal. Within a year, 60 beds were added  because of  the shortage of hospital  services in Nassau County.  By the end of its first decade of serv ice to our community, Franklin Gener al became a nonprofit voluntary hospi tal governed by a community board of  trustees. This unique transfer of own ership was prompted by the changing  concepts of health care delivery in the  medical field.  Franklin General's second  decade  under community sponsorship was a  dynamic period. During that time, the  hospital had completed a new 16-bed  emergency department,  an urgently  needed 99-bed addition, and a 300-car  parking  field.  Included  in  the addi tions to the facility were an eight-bed  coronary care unit and an eight-bed  intensive care unit, which  is consid ered one of the finest in the area. Also  included was a 21-bed short-term psy chiatric unit.  The hospital is looking forward to a  third decade of service to its surround ing  communities.  Franklin General  now has a total of 305 beds, including  a new set of initiatives geared toward  teaching programs,  home  care  and  long-term care services and other out reach programs geared for the elderly.  As a member of the hospital's advi sory committee, I believe the future  holds many  promises  for Franklin  General. Despite changes and innova tions in the hospital field, one thing  remains constant: Franklin General is  continuing its commitment to provid ing quality health care to all.e  9071  ALL-AMERICAN CITY AWARDED  TO SANTA ANA  HON.

522,831,7,Mr. PATTERSON.," Mr. Speaker, the  city of Santa Ana was recently chosen  as a recipient of the All-American City  Award, a national honor bestowed by  the National Municipal League. Be cause the award recognizes citizen in volvement by community residents, it  is also a direct reflection on the mayor  of Santa Ana, Gordon Bricken.  Having served as mayor of Santa  Ana since April 14, 1981, Mr. Bricken  is now stepping down from that post.  Gordon Bricken has been an out standing leader in contributing to the  general welfare and prosperity of the  city of Santa Ana, and has been a cen tral force in the growth of the commu nity. Mr. Bricken has been instrumen tal in creating a new image for the city  of Santa Ana through community ac tivities such as the Golden City Days,  the Community Christmas Tree and  Christmas Parade, and the Ambassa dor's Ball. He has also  encouraged  open communications between citizens  and local government through commu nity programs such as  the Mayor's  Roundtables and the Santa Ana To morrow Conferences.  During Mr. Bricken's term as mayor,  many projects came to fruition in the  city  of Santa Ana,  including  the  awarding of a cable  television  fran chise,  the opening of the Downtown  Parking Structure, the initial develop ment of Sasser Park, and the opening  of the Orange County World Trade  Center.  Gordon Bricken has taken part in  various programs that have had a ben eficial  impact on  the city of Santa  Ana. Mayor Bricken led the Orange  County delegation  to  the ""Invest in  America's Cities"" Conference in Hong  Kong and served on the board of direc tors of the Santa Ana Economic Devel opment Corp.  In addition,  as  chairman of  the  urban rail subcommittee of the U.S.  Conference of Mayors, Mr. Bricken  has supported local rail transportation  through active participation  in local  and national conferences.  In recognition of his distinguished  and  unselfish  contribution  toward  civic betterment,  it  is with pleasure  that I invite my colleagues to join me  in recognizing Gordon Bricken for his  dedicated work as mayor of Santa  Ana, Calif. The citizens of Santa Ana  and  I  appreciate  the mayor's hard  work and accomplishments and will  miss his outstanding leadership.e  ",1983

Jacob  Rabinow,  long-time advocate of  the  importance of small business in tech nological  innovation, presently chief  research engineer at the National En gineering Laboratory, U.S. Depart ment  of Commerce, will  receive  a  doctor of humane  letter at Towson  State University on Sunday, May 22,  1983. Sponsored by the school of busi ness  and  economics,  this honorary  degree is in recognition of his contri butions to the development of Ameri can technology.  Jacob Rabinow, an evaluator for the  Office of Energy-Related Inventions,  U.S. Department of Commerce, has  aided more than 200 small businesses  to get support from the Department  of Energy  for small business  inven tions. He has represented the Depart ment of Commerce at ""Survival and  Growth of Small R&D Firms,"" a con ference sponsored by the Small Busi ness Administration, and the National  Science  Foundation  conference  on  small business.  In addition, Mr. Ra binow frequently testifies before Con gress on the role of the inventor in the  development of American technology.  Mr. Rabinow holds 218 patents on a  wide variety of mechanical and electri cal devices. They include the automat ic letter-sorting machine used by the  U.S. Post Office, phonograph record playing equipment, the automatic reg ulation of clocks used in all American  cars, the magnetic particle clutch, the  best-match principle  in  reading ma chines and many safety mechanisms  for ordnance devices.  For his scientific achievements, he  has been honored with the Exception al Service Award of the Department of  Commerce <1949), the President's Cer tificate of Merit <1948),  the War De partment's Certificate of Appreciation  <1949),  the  CCNY  Engineering  School's  50th  Anniversary Medal  (1969),  the Henry Diamond Award  <1977),  and  the  Industrial Research  and Development  Scientist  of  the  Year Award <1980).

U.S. AGRICULTURAL POLICY  HON. BERKLEY BEDELL  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April19, 1983   ",1983
524,844,7,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Speaker, of all  the many pressing issues this Congress  will be addressing during the coming  months, some of the more crucial will  have to do with agriculture. With in creasing regularity, we are faced with  insurmountable  evidence  that  the  problems confronting U.S. agriculture  are structural. The amazing productiv ity of the American farmer has led to  mounting surpluses that threaten to  overwhelm the conventional sources of  demand for food, feed, and fiber, and  the search for balance is driven not  just by the desire to end the billions of  dollars of taxpayer outlays required to  pay for land idling and surplus com modity storage, but also to reduce the  growing pressures on the international  trading system.  Perhaps never before has the need  for farsighted changes in agricultural  policy  been  so  urgent. There  has  always been a great deal of discussion  about how new domestic outlets for  domestic agricultural production can  be  encouraged with a minimum of  Government  interference,  and  in  a  cost effective way, but  today,  those  new outlets are needed as part of a  structural reorientation of American  agriculture. The objective must be to  stimulate new value added processing  industries that will utilize U.S. agricul tural production in a way that benefits  consumers, producers, and  taxpayers  alike by providing demand for fuel and  chemical outlets,  in addition  to  the  conventional food, feed, and fiber.  A recent analysis of some of the per ceived changes in Soviet agricultural  policy since Yuri Andropov's rise  to  April 19, 1983  power  is worthy of consideration  in  this regard. In a recent Pro Farmer ar ticle, a highly regarded Soviet analyst  noted that changes  in Moscow's ap proach to agriculture point to a live stock policy emerging which counts on  domestically  grown  feeds,  possibly  supplemented by high protein concen trates as the best tor the maintenance  of these animals (emphasis added). To  some, this may appear to be yet a fur ther  exacerbation  of  our  current  export problems,  in which past cus tomers are moving further away from  consumption of excess U.S. produc tion. However,  this change  in policy  could  actually  afford  the United  States  an  opportunity  that  could  enable  us  to  contribute  toward  a  number of important national objec tives simultaneously. This opportunity  should not be lost.  As the following article printed in  last summer's Foreign Affairs maga zine points out, a U.S. fuel ethanol in dustry would provide our agricultural  policymakers with a new degree of  much-needed flexibility. By converting  the starch portion of U.S.-produced  corn and other grains  into  a  high  grade liquid fuel (ethanol), while still  preserving all of the original protein,  vitamins, and minerals, U.S. grain un dergoes  a  value-added process  that  meets both United States, and Soviet  (or any other trading partners') needs.  The  concentrated  <one-third  the  weight) high protein coproduct is an  excellent animal feeding material, and  its  transportation and storage  is far  more efficient than that of the bulk  grain. The United States benefits by  the production of a high grade liquid  fuel extender and octane enhancer, in creased economic  activity  and  jobs,  and improved trade flexibility, and the  Soviets and other U.S. customers bene fit from a concentrated feeding prod uct that more efficiently suits  their  needs.  Mr. Speaker, I commend this article  to my  colleagues' attention  as we  begin to focus on the crucial agricul tural policy questions in the weeks to  come.  The article follows:  MORE BANG FOR THE BUSHEL  To the EDIToR:  Karl-Eugen Wa.dekin's Spring 1982 look at  ""Soviet Agriculture's Dependence on  the  West"" was  a  thought-provoking  analysis  that should be required reading for U.S. ag ricultural policymakers of all stripes. While  it is certainly lamentable, there can be little  doubt  that American agriculture's profit ability under the current method of ""doing  business"" is heavily dependent upon sales to  Moscow.  In analyzing what to expect in the way of  Soviet grain purchases for the next five or  more years, Mr. Wadekin acknowledges that  Moscow will try very hard to cut down on  food imports and speculates that the Ameri can farmer will  find his market  reduced  thereby within a few years.

543,870,7,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, much of  the debate on the withholding amend ment now before us has centered on  the lobbying tactics of the American  Bankers Association and their member  banks.  I am not sure whether the lobbying  question deserves as much attention as  it has received. To my mind the real  issue is whether the Treasury can col lect the revenues it is due without the  onerous and clumsy withholding solu tion.  For the record, however, I think we  ought to take a look at just what the  American bankers have distributed to  their member associations so that we  can all decide for ourselves  if there  has been any misrepresentation of the  issues on the part of the ABA. At this  point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a  reproduction of  the sample adver tisements, press releases, customer let ters, and other materials included in  the ""withholding kits"" distributed by  the ABA.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  A SPECIAL MESSAGE TO THE 80 MILLION  SAVERS AND INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES  Last summer, Congress passed a law that  will lower the amount of money you earn on  your savings interest and investment divi dends. You will be forced to give the govern ment an  interest-free  loan starting next  July 1.  Unless you act now, 10 percent of your in terest and dividends will be withheld auto matically from your accounts starting next  July 1.  Help repeal this bad law now!  Some facts about ""savings withholding"":  Starting next July 1, the government will  require that every institution that pays you  interest-banks, savings and  loans, money  market mutual funds, brokerage firms,  in surance  companies  and  corporations  which you own stock and earn dividendsin  ",1983
544,883,7,Mr. KASTEN.," The Senator is cor rect in terms of the procedure. I do  not share the Senator's perception of  what might happen.  I  believe  that  there is a good chance, because of the  Senate action in arriving at this modi fication  and  the  tremendous public  outcry on  this  issue,  that the Ways  and Means Committee will act to sub stitute this measure on a House reve nue bill or go through some other kind  of a mechanism which will allow a  House vote on this matter. It is my  hope that this modified language can  pass the House and go on to the Presi dent.  ",1983
545,883,7,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, will the  Senator yield to me?  ",1983
546,883,7,Mr. HEFLIN., I yield.  ,1983
547,883,7,Mr. BYRD.," Perhaps I can help in  answering the question that is in the  minds of some here. I have just been  informed  that  the Secretary of  the  Treasury, Mr. Regan, has said in an  interview with the press that his mind  has not been changed and neither has  the  administration's  mind  been  changed. In other words, they oppose  the repeal and I assume they oppose  the compromise.  ",1983
548,883,7,Mr. HEFLIN., Has the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin received any  assurance whatsoever that the Presi dent would not veto this compromise  if it got to him?  ,1983
549,883,7,Mr. KASTEN.,"  I have not received  that assurance. It is my understanding  that at the present  time  the White  House has neither approved nor disap proved this compromise, but I think it  is important that this morning in the  daily press conference Mr. Speakes did  not say the President would veto this  bill and neither did the Secretary of  Treasury say that he would veto this  bill.  Their position is not unlike that of  the Senator from Kansas who  is  in  favor of withholding. But  they are  going to have to deal with the problem  and this modified language is closer to  their position and is more likely to be  accepted than a flatout repeal, which  would have been vetoed for certain.  ",1983
550,883,7,Mr. HEFLIN., Is it fair to say that  the President or anyone speaking for  him has not indicated that the pencil  has come out from behind the ear and  back  into his pocket? He has  said  nothing to give the Senator any assur ance whatsoever?  ,1983
551,883,7,Mr. KASTEN.," He has not, but  I  think it is significant that this morn ing he did not take the pencil out from  behind his ear and say ""Now we are  going  to veto."" He did  the opposite  and said ""We neither approve nor dis approve."" So I think there is a chance.  ",1983
552,883,7,Mr. HEFLIN., Let me ask the next  question which is this: Does the Sena tor plan to offer this amendment to  some other vehicle?  ,1983
553,883,7,Mr. KASTEN.," I do plan to offer this  amendment or  an outright  appeal.  Frankly, it would be my intention to  offer an amendment not only on a  debt ceiling bill, which was discussed,  but on any other revenue measure or a  supplemental  appropriations  bill  or  any kind of emergency bill that has  the power  to make  it all  the way  through the system.

557,883,7,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  let us not kid ourselves about this so called compromise. It is a bad compro mise.  I  respect  the Senator  from  Kansas and  the battle  that he has  made with respect to the withholding  issue. But I do not intend to go along  with the compromise because the com promise effectively puts off withhold ing until 1987. That is wrong. It was  wrong yesterday, it was wrong the day  before,  and we  should  defeat  the  Kasten amendment.  Now I can count, and I understand  the  position  of  the Senator  from  Kansas, and I respect him for his ef forts  in  this respect. But no matter  how one slices this issue this is a tre mendous victory  for  the bankers of  this country. And I hope that before  we get done in the Halls of Congress  somehow  the House of Representa tives will not go along, and I hope that  if the House of Representatives does  go along with  the so-called compro mise the President sees fit to veto it.

565,883,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I yield  1 minute to the Senator from Mon tana.  ",1983
566,883,7,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, the  Senate is going to vote on a delay of  withholding tax on interest and divi dends, and it is well and good, but the  vehicle is not any good and the House  of Representatives  is  not  seriously  thinking of doing anything on this rec iprocity bill before July 1. Maybe they  never will. The House of Representa tives  is  going  to want  to originate  whatever action is taken on this, and  we may wait a long time over here and  the people of this country may wait a  long time and find out that July 1 has  come and gone and this provision of  law is put into effect.  What  the people of  this country  would like our system of government  to do  is  for  the Senate  to pass an  amendment  to  either  stall off  the  withholding provision or repeal it and  the House of Representatives  to do  the same and vote on it and then the  President sign it.  All this talk about the President ve toing it is one thing. That is his pre rogative to veto it if he wants to. But  my concern  is  that the Senate act,  have  the chance  to vote on  it,  the  House of Representatives have  the  chance to vote on it and get to the  veto. We will also have a chance to  vote on the veto.  This vehicle today does not give us  that opportunity because  this  reci procity bill was not orginated in the  House of Representatives  itself and  the bill is in jeopardy. Because of the  nature of  the  reciprocity bill,  this  issue may never be voted on in the  House  of  Representatives  quickly  enough using this method.  I feel very strongly that we are going  to have to have another vehicle later  on if we ever hope to have a House  vote on it and then the President have  his chance to veto it if he wants, and  we will also have a chance to override  that veto.  The American people expect repre sentative government to work.  ",1983

571,987,7,Mr.  DOMENICI.," Mr.  President,  Congress  often  designates  special  weeks and months commemorating a  particular group or event. In addition  to providing an opportunity for na tional  recognition  of  such  groups,  these weeks  have  come,  in  recent  years, to be used as a way to focus at tention on a particular problem or dis ease. National Alzheimer's Disease  Week,  National  Physical  Fitness  Month, National Employ  the Older  Worker Week, all serve to awaken us  to the importance of these issues. This  month of April  is of special  impor tance because it has been deemed ""Na tional  Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month.""  According to the National Commit tee for the Prevention of Child Abuse,  the last 5 years have witnessed a 100percent increase in the number of re ported incidents of child abuse. Last  year alone, an estimated 1.1 million  children were in some way abused or  neglected. These figures become even  more staggering when one notes that  they are representative of only those  cases that are reported. And I  think  here is where the whole notion behind  prevention becomes critical. Although  it has been determined  that child  abuse cuts across all class lines and re ligious  and  cultural  backgrounds,  there remains a very deep fear of the  stigma attached to it. Experts also cite  a fear that the child will be perma nently taken away from the parents as  another reason why incidents go unre ported. What this also means, howev er,  is that neither the child nor the  parent  can  receive  the  assistance  needed to solve the problem.  A New York Times article addressing  this issue discussed the cases of several  parents who, under the strain of enor mous pressure, be it emotional, profes sional or  financial,  simply were no  longer able to deal patiently with the  average misbehavior of their children.  They recognized how close they were  to abusing their child. They also saw  the grave necessity of seeking some  outside help. These are not parents  who are alcoholics, or suffering from  some other disorder. These are aver age people who,  like you and I, are  faced with the problems of daily life  and have buckled under the enormous  stress that our lives are often charac terized by. Fortunately,  the persons  discussed in this article had a place to  tum.  In response to the growing incidents  of child abuse, nurseries and centers  equipped to keep children for a day or  two are springing up all-over the coun try. If a parent fears that they might  abuse, batter, or in some other way  harm their child,  they can take the  child to one of these centers where  they will be fed and can sleep until  some other course of action can be ar rived  at. Often,  the parent  simply  needs some time to get over what pre cipitated the crisis in the first place. If  the  problem  is more  deep  rooted,  social workers are recruited, or child  care  facilities  are  provided,  or  the  parent is enrolled in some sort of a re habilitation program designed  to ad dress whatever problem they may be  experiencing. What  is  important,  though, is that a possible incident can  be  averted. Programs  such  as  this  truly are preventative  in  that  they  offer immediate respite from a crisis  situation, and then provide the neces sary followup to insure that both the  child and the parent will be protected  from  the future possibility of child  abuse and the terrible suffering that  both experience as a result.  I extend my strongest support to the  development of  this  idea, and hope  that with this month and the atten tion and concern that will be directed  toward  this  tragic problem,  further  initiatives will emerge  that will ad dress child abuse  in a  realistic, con crete manner    THE REDIRECTION OF JOBS  BILL FUNDING   ",1983
572,987,7,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President, on  April 7 the Department of Agriculture  announced at a hearing before the Ap propriations Committee's Subcommit tee on Agriculture, Rural Develop ment and Related Agencies that they  had unexpectedly run out of funds in  17 States to loan farmers for operating  capital  through  the Farmers Home  Administration.  Secretary Block, time after time, has  proudly stated that the Reagan ad ministration  has  significantly  in creased  the  level of operating  loan  funds extended by FmHA. What he  has not said, however,  is  that these  funding levels have been necessitated  by the disastrous economic situation  our  farmers have  faced. More and  more  farmers have had  their  local  bank turn them away, making FmHA  their only credit source.  Until April 7,  administration wit nesses have consistently testified that  they had sufficient funds to serve the  needs of qualified  farmers.  In fact,  even the first time the question of the  adequacy of funds was raised at the  hearing on April 7,  the administra tion's witness indicated that operating  loan funds remained and that those  funds might very well be sufficient to  last the fiscal year.  I raise this issue, Mr. President, for  two basic reasons. First, it is clear that  the Reagan administration has not  acted  in good  faith by keeping  the  Congress informed that operating loan  funds were in short supply. By the end  of the first week in March, notices had  been sent  to 10 States authorizing  them  to use funds  reserved for  the  third and fourth quarters of this fiscal  year to help offset the high demand  for loans. At that point, it should have  been obvious that a problem existed.  Was Congress notified? No.  In fact,  representatives  of  FmHA  testified  before the Appropriations Committee  in  the House  and  the Agriculture  Committees of both the House and the  Senate between early March and April  7,  but no mention was made  that  funds for operating loans were quickly  dwindling. Only when they had com pletely run out of money in 17 States  and were faced with a politically em barrassing problem did the Reagan ad ministration  admit  that  a  problem  even existed. This  inept  silence by  FmHA, combined with the unwilling ness of the Office of Management and  Budget to allow a supplemental to be  sent forward to the Congress created  the emergency situation we faced.  Mr. President, this brings me to the  second reason I have raised this issue  today. Last Friday, Secretary Block  announced that due to the extraordi nary emergency that existed, he would  utilize authority provided him in the  Department of Agriculture Organic  Act of 1944 (7 U.S.C. 2257) to transfer  funds from other programs to provide  an additional $400 million for operat ing  loans.  Instead  of  transferring  funds from the FmHA emergency loan  program, which has an unlimited ap propriation available to it, the Reagan  administration chose  to  redirect an  amount equal to one-half of the funds  the Congress recently provided in the  jobs bill for the rural water and waste  disposal  loan and grant programs funds specifically appropriated on an  emergency basis to create jobs in rural  America.  Currently, there is a backlog of over  $1 billion worth of water and waste  disposal project on hand, and millions  of Americans who are unemployed and  eager to return to work. To make the  specific decision to utilize these funds  when a perfectly legitimate and feasi ble  alternative  existed  clearly  indi cates the degree of callousness of this  administration  towards  the needs of  the unemployed and rural America.  The use of the interchange author ity granted by the Organic Act of 1944  in this manner, redirecting funds the  Congress had specifically appropriated  to meet an emergency need  just 1  month  ago,  raises  serious  question  whether  this  interchange  authority  should be  reviewed and further  re stricted.

573,1000,7,Mr. SEIBERLING.," I  just think the  gentleman  has made  an  excellent  statement. I think the gentleman from  New York, Mr. STRATTON's amendment  has really helped clarify the issue. But  I would like to make sure that the gen tleman from New York understands it  as I do and that is this: Whether the  nuclear  freeze  resolution  passes  or  whether it does not pass, the Congress  is going to reserve the right to take  each weapons  issue on its merits  in  terms of how it affects our overall de fense posture and that is going to con tinue until we ratify a freeze resolu tion at which time we can look at the  whole picture.  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. That is  absolutely correct.  <On  request of Mr. DANIEL and by  unanimous consent, Mr. DoWNEY of  New York was allowed to proceed for 2  additional minutes.)  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. I yield  to the gentleman from Virginia.  ",1983
574,1000,7,Mr. DANIEL.,"  I  thank  the gentle man.  I wish to commend both sides in this  discussion,  for  this clarification. Mr.  MARKEY was careful  to point out a  moment ago that nothing in the reso lution said that there would be unilat eral disarmament. What confused a lot  of members was the legislative history  made on the floor.  I certainly com mend both sides for this clarification.  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. I thank  the gentleman and I yield to my col league from North Carolina.  Mr. MARTIN of North Carolina. I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I want to commend the statement  just made by the gentleman from Vir ginia, because the matter of the legis lative history did indeed need  to be  made clear, because there was an am biguity. Our colleague from Massachu setts had  just said  that  there was  nothing in here about unilateral disar mament. Well, he was not listening to  my earlier statement. I was saying the  same thing that there was nothing for  unilateral disarmament. But  in  the  colloquy which he and I engaged in  the first day of debate, he made clear  his own personal view was  to  take  away  the  bargaining  chips  of  the  President  of  the United States.  I  submit that is not a bilateral posture.  That is unilateral posture which he  made and is entitled to hold as a free  citizen in this country. What I hope to  do and what we have now done with  the Stratton amendment is  to make  clear that this resolution  itself does  not support denying President Reagan  bargaining chips. This resolution by  itself does not move or obligate any  unilateral  act  on  the part of  the  United States regardless of what indi vidual Members of the Congress may  want to do later. This resolution itself  does not support what very clearly ap pears to be a unilateral position taken  by the Freeze Convention in St. Louis  back in February.  I am delighted we have come to this  point.  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. I com mend the gentleman, I commend all  the gentlemen, you and you and you  and you and I commend the commend,  and I want to thank you all for allow ing me to commend you.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. MARTIN OF NORTH  CAROLINA  Mr. MARTIN of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. MARTIN of  North Carolina: Page 4, line 14, immediately  after ""capabilities"" insert ""at present and in  the future"".  Page 4, after line 22, insert the following  new paragraph <3> and redesignate existing  paragraphs (3)  through <6>  as paragraphs  <4> through <7>. respectively:  ""(3) Giving special attention to destabiliz ing factors in the nuclear balance, including  relative ages of weapons and their rates of  obsolescence."".  Mr. MARTIN  of North Carolina  (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  amendment be considered as read and  printed in the RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  North Carolina?  There was no objection.  Mr. MARTIN of North Carolina. I  thank the Chairman.  Now that the Congress and Commit tee of the Whole has dealt with what  amounts to a disclaimer of anyone's  presumption  that  this  resolution  might be a device for imposing a uni lateral restraint on  the part of  the  United States, there are other ques tions that need to be raised and I hope  they can be dealt with in an equally  satisfactory way.  One of those was a question that we  have discussed back and forth, a ques tion which has had charts shown on  both sides of the aisle, and that is the  question of obsolescence of the strate gic nuclear forces of the United States.  You will  recall  that over  the  last  couple of years we have had quite a lot  of debate about whether the Soviet  Union or the United States possesses  the stronger nuclear force. And argu ments have pointed out  that while  they have a larger blast power of all of  their warheads which are much larger,  that the United States had a  larger  number of warheads and so the debate  had gone, as to which was the more  important in maintaining a strategic  balance.  But the essential point of it all  is  that regardless of who has the larger  number of weapons, regardless of who  might have the larger weapons, the es sential point  is  that we be able  to  maintain a  force, a  retaliatory force  that cannot be taken out by a surprise  massive  first  strike  by  the Soviet  Union.  We need to be able to assure them  and assure ourselves and our allies  that even  if they were  to move  the  most devastating strike against us as a  military strategy on their part, that a  substantial  part  of  our  retaliatory  force would be able  to survive  that  strike and pose against them a major  retaliatory strike which they could not  endure.  That is the essential deterrence pos ture of the United States today.  In my view, we have such a credible  deterrent, principally in the 31 Posei don submarines, many of which are  patrolling  the North Atlantic  and  North Pacific today; others of which  are being  reoutfitted for  the newer  Trident I missile.  And yet while we have that retalia tory credible deterrent today, there is  no guarantee that we will have it in  the future, if a freeze imposes a lock  on present weapons and allows no way  for us  to modernize or no way  to  obtain offsetting  reductions on  the  part of the Soviet Union.  Now we have already had an amend ment that dealt with the question of  modernization. That was the Stratton  amendment in the first day of debate  and that was disposed of by changing  the word ""modernization"" in the Za blocki amendment to allow no modern ization but  to allow maintenance of  our forces, which mooted for the time  being that question. It is a question  then that we have not yet resolved.  We have not resolved it because it has  been  unclear  as  to what  this  bill  wanted to say to our negotiators on  the subject of modernization.  0 1230  And so what I have presented here is  an alternative way of trying to resolve  that problem of not  the  imbalance  today, not the question of credible de terrent  today, but  the question of  credible deterrent 10 years from now,  and 20 and more years from now. It is  an attempt to preserve the essential  equivalence which is a goal and objec tive of the Zablocki resolution <H.J.  Res. 13) which is before us, to provide  that that same goal must be preserved  in the future, insofar as these negotia tions are able to deal with it.  So I have added after the words in  the bill, ""essential equivalence,""  the  additional words, ""at present and in  the future.""  This would give our negotiators, as  well  as  the Soviet Union  for  that  matter, an opportunity to discuss the  ",1983

578,1013,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Chairman,  I  just want to ask a further point here.  The B-52's, as I understand it, are  now so expensive and so obsolescent  that in fact we are having  to have  manufactured many of the parts by  hand because they no longer have any  lines for them and there is no longer  any technology for them.  Does  the gentleman think that in  that sense we might actually see an in crease in the total cost of our air leg of  the  triad  in defense  if we were  to  freeze and try to maintain for the next  decade the current B-52 force?  ",1983
579,1013,7,Mr. HUNTER.," Certainly,  I  think  there is a good chance that if we had  to rebuild the B-52 production lines,  we would have an extremely substan tial investment and it could very well  cost as much as the B-1's. It would not  be  an  inexpensive program  and  it  would probably not save money.  Mr. Chairman,  I  think  that  the  point has been well made  that this  freeze has one fatal defect and that is  that it does not fulfill or discharge our  responsibility as Members of Congress  to the men and women of the armed  services who we are constitutionally  charged to arm and to protect.  I would urge every Member of this  Congress  to  vote  in  favor  of  this  amendment.  Remember, it is our duty as Mem bers of Congress to raise and equip the  armed services of this Nation. If we  pass  this  resolution without  this  amendment, we will be doing them a  great disservice.  I yield back the balance of my time.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR.

Nothing in this joint resolution  shall be construed( 1)  to prevent, during any negotiations  pursuant to this resolution, or  (2)  to require  that,  in any negotiations  pursuant  to  this  resolution,  the United  States agree to a provision which would pre vent such modernization and deployment of  United States new or improved dual capable  delivery systems as the United States may  determine is required to maintain the capa bility of the United States defense posture.

597,1013,7,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Chairman, we  have debated  this  resolution  for  a  period of time. It is obviously the third  day of debate. The first day of debate  goes back better than 1 month ago  now. I believe it was on March 16 of  this  year.  During  that  particular  debate,  there was a very  interesting  dialog  that  took  place  between  a  number of Members revolving around  the word and words of ""systems with  dual capabilities.""  Obviously, the freeze resolution does  attempt  to  include delivery systems,  and  there was  some  question  on  March 16 as to what we mean by deliv ery systems.  The question was whether  it did  cover  systems with dual  capability;  ",1983
598,1026,7,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr.  Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I  think one fact that should bear  great weight in this debate is the fact  that we have recently had to go to a  new advanced cruise missile just so our  cruise missiles could penetrate Soviet  air space. I recall the gentleman of the  committee seemed to be very surprised  when I told him that our B-52's would  not be able  to penetrate Soviet air space in the 1990's, and he seemed to  be surprised that we would not be able  to have successful missions up to the  year 2000.  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gen tleman for his action. I think it points  out that the Soviet Union, by upgrad ing  their air defenses, can basically  disarm unilaterally or can disarm ef fectively our air-breathing leg of the  triad.  ",1983
599,1026,7,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. HUNTER).  Mr. Chairman, when one looks ini tially at the idea of a freeze on nuclear  weapons,  one  is  attracted  to  that,  thinking that somehow that will end  the peril or the thought of nuclear  holocaust in this world. We must not  lose sight of the need for mutual de terrence, and if in our effort to seek a  freeze we do not realize the implica tions of nonnuclear defense systems  that will render the nuclear capability  of the United States ineffective, then  in fact we are not enforcing a freeze of  equal measure; we would be enforcing  a  freeze of unequal measures to the  peril of the U.S. citizens that we are to  serve.  This is a simple amendment. All it  says is that there should be symmetry  with this leg of the triad, as we did  recognize when we accepted symmetry  to our nuclear-capable submarine fleet  and  the  defenses  that  are  aimed  against it.  This is a sincere amendment. It is of fered in a spirit of cooperation, that if  we in fact are going to try and work  our way  toward a  freeze effort, we  ought to make sure it is done with our  eyes open, and  that nonnuclear de fense systems that would  impact on  the equivalency contained within the  freeze would be taken into consider ation.

602,1026,7,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  appreciate the gentleman's yielding.  I  just have a question. In the last  Stratton amendment, as amended by  the chairman of the committee, would  it not in fact cover what the gentle man is trying to do here?  ",1983
603,1026,7,Mr. LUNGREN.," Perhaps so, perhaps  not. The reason is that the air defense  systems are not nuclear  in and of  themselves, and since the subject of  the freeze is nuclear, I think there can  be some confusion there. It would also  direct our negotiators  to make sure  they were concerned with that side of  it; that is, the effectiveness could be  rendered less or absolutely nothing by  an air defense system on  the other  side.

605,1026,7,Mr. BEDELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in favor of House Joint Resolution 13  and urge my colleagues  to vote  in  favor  of  its  final  passage without  amendment. Clearly, House Joint Res olution 13 presents the Congress with  a unique opportunity to initiate the  first, and most important, steps that  will serve to slow, stop and reverse the  perilous course that both the United  States and the Soviet Union have pur sued with respect to nuclear weaponry  over the last 37 years.  As an original cosponsor of this im portant  concept  and  author  of  a  second resolution that is intended to  serve as the first element in the imple mentation of a freeze agreement, I rec ognize the overwhelming benefits that  a freeze offers to our own national se curity, survival, and ultimately world  peace.  Today, we are presented with a mas sive array of  information,  statistics  and charts depicting,  in some cases,  Soviet  superiority  (missile  throw  weight) to U.S. strategic nuclear forces  and,  in others, decisive U.S.  advan tages (more deliverable warheads) over  Soviet nuclear forces. In this regard, I  am sure we all would agree that in the  present strategic environment, a state  of rough parity exists between both  the United States and Soviet nuclear  arsenals. While I,  too, am quite con cerned over the growing capabilities of  Soviet nuclear forces, I recognize that  the best way to prevent their contin ued improvement is through a mutual ly verifiable agreement that ""freezes""  their force in their present configura tions. I also find it important to note  that to the best of my knowledge, no  U.S.  strategic planner has ever ex pressed a willingness  to  trade U.S.  strategic nuclear  forces  in  favor of  their Soviet counterparts. A negotiat ed agreement that would lead to a mu tually verifiable freeze on the testing,  producting and deployment of nuclear  weapons would serve to preserve and  maintain the present balance in strate gic nuclear forces from which legiti mate  reductions  in  these  awesome  weapons systems could be scored.  Further, House joint resolution does  not  prevent  needed modernizations  that could be made and conducted on  U.S.  strategic systems during  freeze  negotiations. However,  once  imple mented and ratified, a  freeze would  prevent the perpetual modernizations,  remodernization,  improvement, coun terimprovement cycles that have char acterized the nuclear arms race since  its inception in 1945.  Clearly then, the freeze acts as a sta bilizing agent or, more  importantly,  the breaking mechanism from which  we can put an end to the madness of  nuclear arms competition. The freeze  offers a clear alternative to the past  and would  once  again  reestablish  American preeminence in the field of  arms control. The freeze would pre vent the implementation of the next,  and even more destabilizing, round of  the arms race in which ""first strike""  weapons systems would be developed  and deployed. The freeze-because of  its  elegant  simplicity-represents  a  sane alternative  to  the madness of  MAD <mutually assured destruction)  and in my mind what may be our last  chance to insure the survival of the  human  race,  civilization,  and  our  planet. As elected Representatives, we  cannot or should not allow this oppor tunity to slip away. I urge you all to  vote in favor of this important alterna tive.   ",1983
606,1026,7,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Chair man, I  join with my colleagues today  in support of House Joint Resolution  13,  the nuclear weapons and  reduc tions resolution.  I support this resolution, because I  believe that the strength and dignity  of working for peace is a more power ful weapon  than nuclear armament  could ever become.  ",1983
607,1039,7,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of legislation to pro tect  the health of our people,  the  purity of our environment, and the vi tality of our commerce and industry  from dangers posed by reckless dispos al of hazardous wastes.  I urge Congress to give prompt and  favorable  attention  to  two major  pieces of legislation of which I am a  cosponsor: H.R. 2478,  the Hazardous  Waste Control and Enforcement Act  of 1983,  introduced by Congressman  FLoRIO; and the Hazardous Substances  Response Act of 1983,  introduced by  Congressman RICHARDSON.  Together  these two measures would strengthen  Federal regulation of current hazard ous waste disposal, establish incentives  for  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes  through recycling and other alterna tive means, and expand State and Fed eral efforts to clean up existing haz ardous waste disposal sites.  Our Nation's productive capacity is  unequaled in the world. One byprod uct of this great capacity, however, is  an ever-increasing volume of hazard ous waste. Each year our Nation pro duces between 255  and 275 million  tons of wastes that are highly toxic to  humans.  For many years, those who generat ed hazardous wastes faced few State  or Federal restrictions on their right  to dispose of these wastes. As a result,  immense volumes of wastes have been  deposited in a careless and irresponsi ble manner allowing escape of wastes  into the land, water, and air. Tragedies  such as those that have befallen the  citizens of Niagara, N.Y., and Times  Beach, Mo., have finally focused the  attention of the American public on  this menacing and difficult problem.  My own State of South Carolina  faces serious problems in cleaning up  carelessly deposited hazardous wastes.  Three of the 418 sites that the Envi ronmental  Protection  Agency  has  identified as the Nation's most danger ous are in my State, and one of these  sites is in my district. Although clean up of these sites has made progress,  there have recently been discovered in  my State a large number of other sites  that pose potential hazards and that  will undoubtedly prove costly and dif ficult to clean. The State administra tive agency charged with responsibil ity for hazardous waste management  could efficiently use additional staff  and resources  to carry out a speedy  cleanup of these many sites. The legis lation  that  I  am  supporting  today  would provide such assistance.  Meanwhile hazardous wastes contin ue to accumulate in South Carolina at  a rapid rate. My State is a major re pository for hazardous wastes generat ed not only in South Carolina but in  other States as well. In fact, almost  half of the hazardous wastes placed  each year in landfills in South Caroli na is generated outside the State. One  of the major sites for such disposal is  in Sumter County, in my district. We  must take steps to insure that hazard ous wastes deposited on such sites are  safely and adequately contained.  A major new hazardous waste dis posal facility was also proposed for a  site just across the State border from  my district, in Anson County, N.C. An  environmental study showed that the  composition of the soil and the high  watertable underlying this site made it  unsuited  for  containing  hazardous  waste. Many of my constituents were  justifiably concerned that if a hazard ous waste facility were placed on this  site, hazardous wastes would seep into  groundwater near the site and pollute  a  tributary of  the Pee Dee River,  which provides a principal source of  water for drinking, agriculture, and in dustry. The  fact  that  this  landfill  could potentially have affected  resi dents in more than one State, and that  it possibly could have qualified for a  permit under current Federal regula tions, illustrates the need for more rig orous waste disposal  laws applicable  thoughout the country.  The legislation that I urge Congress  to adopt would  take major steps  to  prevent continued careless disposal of  hazardous wastes and to clean up al ready existing hazardous waste dispos al sites.  The Resource Conservation and Re covery Act of 1976 <RCRA> establishes  the legal framework for EPA's current  regulation of hazardous wastes. It is  now generally recognized that RCRA  fails to mandate sufficiently rigorous  regulation of hazardous wastes. The  regulations  that EPA has  issued  to  date under RCRA  exempt  far  too  many hazardous wastes and hazardous  waste facilities, and they set perform ance standards that in many cases are  too lax. H.R. 2478 remedies these defi ciencies in RCRA.  H.R. 2478 adopts the general policy  that reliance on land disposal facilities  should be minimized because landfills  cannot insure perpetual containment  of hazardous wastes. The bill, howev er, takes a realistic and balanced ap proach to the issue of landfills by im plicitly assuming that, under rigorous  safeguards, landfill disposal of certain  substances must be allowed to contin ue for some time, until suitable alter native  technologies become available  for widespread use.  To reduce the risks of landfill use  during this interim period, H.R. 2478  would prohibit  the  land disposal of  certain of the most dangerous wastes,  including,  in certain concentrations,  cyanide, PCB's, arsenic, and cadmium.  It would authorize EPA  to prohibit  land disposal of many other wastes,  and  it specifically  lists dioxins as a  hazardous substance subject to EPA  regulation. It also prohibits the under ground injection of hazardous wastes  near sources of drinking water, and it  restricts the landfill disposal of liquid  wastes.  I believe that States can make a val uable contribution to hazardous waste  management. Many States  regulate  hazardous wastes that totally escape  Federal  regulation, and some States  have developed farsighted waste man agement programs that now serve as  models for Federal action. The Reagan  administration, however, has drastical ly  reduced  the  amount of  funding  available under RCRA for State haz ardous waste programs.  To strengthen  the  role of States,  H.R. 2478 would authorize increases in  Federal assistance to States for devel opment and implementation of State  hazardous waste programs. It would  also authorize EPA to make grants to  local governments to construct demon stration recycling centers for hazard ous wastes. South Carolina, which has  already  gained  considerable  experi ence with  hazardous waste,  could  make effective use of such assistance.  To protect public safety, H.R. 2478  sets deadlines by which all  landfills  and other hazardous waste facilities  must  either  receive  permits or be  closed. This will insure that landfills  and other facilities currently operat ing under EPA permits will not stay in  business  indefinitely  unless  they  comply with the bill's new permitting  standards.  H.R. 2478 would exempt from regu lation only  those who generate  less  than one-tenth of a ton of hazardous  waste each month. The bill would also  authorize EPA to apply more stringent  regulatory  standards  to  those who  each month generate less than 1 ton  of hazardous waste than to those who  generate more than 1 ton. This flexi ble approach  takes account both of  the need to regulate disposal of the  considerable volumes of wastes gener ated by some small businesses, and the  relatively heavy cost that enforcement  of  the most  stringent  regulations  could impose on such businesses.  Finally, H.R. 2478 strengthens the  remedies available to citizens, States,  municipalities, and the EPA to enforce  hazardous waste laws and regulations;  it reenfores the authority of criminal  investigators; and it increases criminal  penalties for certain classes of hazard ous waste offenses.  H.R. 2478 would take major steps to  prevent recurrence of the type of haz ardous waste disasters  that have af fected many of our people in recent  years. Such prevention of hazardous  waste problems will  prove  far  less  costly  than  cleaning  up  hazardous  waste sites created through irresponsi ble forms of disposal.  The Hazardous Substances Response  Act of 1983, which has been  intro duced in the Senate as S. 860, comple ments  and  strengthens  hazardous  ",1983
608,1052,7,Mr. KRAMER.," Mr. Speaker, from  1959  to 1975 millions of Americans  served their country proudly in Viet nam. Over 57,000 never returned. For  the veterans who came home and the  families of  those who did not, 1982  marked the end of a long silence, when  their country finally turned to them  and reverently saluted their sacrifice.  With the dedication of the Vietnam  Memorial on November 13, 1982, the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Nation  rose above  the  internal con flicts the war evoked in order to recog nize and to honor  those who served  their  country. Since  its dedication,  over 1 million people have come to the  monument to pay tribute to the Viet nam veterans and to rekindle memo ries of lost family and friends.  Helene Monberg, a veteran Washing ton news correspondent, recently ac companied a  family  from Leadville,  Colo., who  came  to Washington  to  visit the memorial and see the name of  their lost loved one engraved in the  polished stone,  to stand among  the  long, solemn granite walls which seem  to state, ""that you gave your lives or  that you gave your youth will always  be remembered.""  I ask permission to have inserted in  the record Mrs. Monberg's eloquent  portrayal of  their experience, which  directly or indirectly is shared by all  of us.  [From the Herald Democrat, Leadville,  Colo., Mar. 11, 19831  MARINE SERGEANT KASTRINOS  WASHINGTON.-Four  residents  of  the  Washington, D.C. area went on a pilgrimage  on Feb. 19 to seek out the name of an Amer ican Hero, Marine Sergeant Jerold (Jerry>  Kastrinos of Leadville.  They were Helene C. Monberg, veteran  news correspondent and a Leadville native  distantly related to the young sergeant by  marriage; her grandniece Jessica Hately, 11,  of McLean, Va.; Mrs. Barbara Evans and her  son Johnny Neitzey, 8, both of Alexandria,  Va.  Their destination was new Memorial  to  the men and women who died in the Viet nam conflict. Jerry Kastrinos left a young  wife and  two small children  to serve his  country in Vietnam, where he was killed in  December, 1967. He also left two grieving  parents, Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kastrinos of  Leadville.  The Washington area was a mess  that  day. A snowstorm had blanketed the Wash ington area on Feb 11 and people were still  digging out. The area around the memorial  was knee-deep in mud. The memorial, pol ished black granite, contains the names of  the 58,000 Americans killed in the Vietnam  conflict, but it looked that day like the end  of a beat-up football field.   Still the people came, hundreds of them  on the first nice weekend day since the Big  Snow. Our group chose  the day because  Mrs. Evans and her son Johnny will soon be  -going overseas  to  join her new husband,  Major Mitchell Evans, in Germany, where  Johnny is looking forward to playing soccer  with the natives.  Jessica, a native of Colorado Springs who  recently moved  to  the Washington area  from Dallas, has been sightseeing, and she  knew where  the Memorial was  located,  hidden between the big memorials to Wash ington  and  Lincoln,  on Washington's  famous Mall.  Once on the site, the 70 slabs of granite  are  intimidating. But  there  is a  friendly  woman on  the site with a  list of nearly  58,000 names of men and women killed in  the Vietnam conflict. She let the group take  a picture of her, with Jessica and Johnny.  Then she found Jerry's name: Jerold Lloyd  Kastrinos, Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, of  Leadville, Colo., on panel No.  31. They  walked over to the panel, which is on the  April 20, 1983  right side of the V-shaped memorial, and  there, about the middle of the panel, was  Jerry's name. It gave one a catch in his  throat. Jerry's name finally honored after  all  of  these  years  of  torment  for  his  family ....  Everyone  took pictures of everyone else  pointing to Jerry's name. It came out quite  clearly  in a couple of  the pictures, even  though the names aren't that large on the  panels. A tiny American flag was placed by  panel 31E. The group took a picture of that  too, and of the large crowd slowly moving in  and around the memorial, many bent on  finding a name just as the four had. Most  walked to the east, enroute to the Washing ton Monument, and at the end of the Viet nam Memorial there was a veteran passing  the American POW I  out literature about  MIA's on which there has been no word to  relatives and friends for many years. They  are potential prisoners of war and missing in  action  servicemen who have never been  heard from even though the Vietnam con flict ended on April 30, 1975. Everyone took  a pamphlet from the veteran from the Vet erans' Vigil Society.  And said a prayer that the agony of the  their relatives and friends will soon be over,  too.e  CLAUDE PEPPER, STATESMAN  EXTRAORDINARY  HON. CHARLES E.

Some 36 million Social Security recipients,  and millions more who are nearing retire ment, count on Claude Pepper to protect  their rights and well-being. And Pepper has  doggedly done so.  When Pepper's admirers worry about his  advancing years and how long he expects to  be on Capitol Hill, he sometimes admits  that he has retirement plans. ""I've set the  year,"" he drawls. As his listeners' concern  grows, he adds without a smile: ""The year  2000. But I reserve the right to change my  mind.""

610,1078,7,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing today with 30 Members of  the New York State  delegation  a  House  joint  resolution which  com memorates the centennial of the open ing of the Brooklyn Bridge.  The resolution calls upon the Presi dent to designate the day of the anni versary, May 24, 1983, as ""Brooklyn  Bridge Day,"" asks the Speaker to ap point  a  congressional delegation  to  attend the celebrations of this imporApril 20, 1983  tant anniversary which are planned in  New York, and requests that enrolled  copies of the resolution be transmitted  to New York's Governor Cuomo,  to  the mayor of the city of New York and our former colleague-Ed Koch,  and  to Brooklyn Borough President  Howard Golden.  The Brooklyn Bridge enjoys a spe cial place in our national history,  in  the archives of architectural achieve ment, and in many of the noted cul tural efforts of our time. When the  bridge opened 100 years ago, it was the  longest suspension bridge in the world.  The cost of $15 million was a signifi cant  investment and was shared by  New York State, New York City, and  by Brooklyn, which then was a sepa rate governmental entity. The bridge  took 13 years to complete.  The  lives of construction workers  were constantly at risk. Huge cham bers called caissons were lowered into  the water. Men worked below the sur face with little air, etching the huge  pilings on which the bridge stands into  the rock below  the surface. At one  point, a fire broke out in an underwa ter chamber. This,  and other acci dents,  resulted  in  the deaths of at  least 20 construction workers.  The project was conceived by John  A. Roebling, who pressed for a  link  over the East River between the cities  of New York and Brooklyn; Washing ton  Roebling,  who  succeeded  his  father  as  chief  engineer 6 months  after  the project began, and Emily  Roebling,  the wife of the chief engi neer, who  carried on many of his  duties once Washington was disabled  after working on a caisson during the  construction process. The Brooklyn  Bridge Centennial Commission stated  recently, ""Emily Roebling assumed an  unparalleled position for a  late 19th  century woman, becoming the link be tween her husband and  the outside  world.""  To mark the opening, on May 24,  1983, Montgomery Schuyler wrote the  following words in Harper's Weekly:  It so happens  that  the work which  likely  to be our most durable monument,  and to convey some knowledge of us to the  most remote posterity, is a work of bare util ity; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace,  but a bridge.  is  Arthur Miller has written about this  magnificent national  treasure  in ""A  View From the Bridge."" The impact of  the film ""Sophie's Choice"" was height ened by  the scenes  filmed  thereon.  The roadway and promenade, inviting  both auto and pedestrian traffic, has  made  this structure  truly a people's  bridge.  With  the date of  the  centennial  nearly upon us, the city of New York,  the Borough of Brooklyn, many busi ness  and  civic  organizations  have  planned celebrations for the centenni al.  ",1983
611,1091,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. Speaker, during  the last several years, many Members  of the House have come increasingly  concerned  over  the  soaring  price  Americans pay for natural gas. This  concern  has  been  heightened  by  recent stories in local newspapers of  people  freezing  to death because of  their  inability  to pay  their heating  bills.  While natural gas prices are skyrock eting around the Nation, the situation  in Iowa has become critical. Within  the last 6 months, two of the major  natural gas pipelines which  supply  Iowa with 90 percent of its gas, have  raised their gas prices nearly 20 per cent,  costing  Iowans  an  additional  $791 million for the natural gas they  use. In fact, the average household is  expected to pay about $725 for natural  gas this year. This is double the figure  Iowans paid in 1979, even when energy  conservations is figured in.  The impact on the local economy is  also severe. For example, officials have  calculated  that  the 835 natural gas  users  in Gutherie Center, Iowa (735  residences and 100 commercial users),  will  pay  approximately  32  percent  more for natural gas during 1983 than  . what they paid in 1982. And that as sumes there will be no more rate in crease  requests added  to  those  that  are  now  pending. With  just  1,713  people, Gutherie Center could lose an  estimated $171,000 from its local econ omy-a hundred dollars for every man,  woman, and child in the town.  Farmers, already  facing  the worst  economic slump since the depression,  are also hit hard. Although they do  not usually heat their homes with nat ural gas,  they do use propane,  two thirds of which comes from natural  gas.  In addition,  Iowa's farmers use  natural gas, directly or indirectly, for  fertilizer and to dry their crops. Since  passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act  of 1978 <NGPA>-legislation which I  opposed-fertilizer  costs  have  risen  more than any other farm cost, except  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  raw  fuels  and  short-term  interest  rates. Farm income, which dropped 19  percent in 1982, threatens to fall an other 16 percent this year, especially if  Congress fails  to reduce the upward  pressure on natural gas prices.  Despite all this, the Reagan adminis tration and some members of the oil  and natural gas industry want to accel erate decontrol of natural gas. The  President's decontrol measure would  modify current law and lift price con trols on gas discovered prior to 1977,  old gas. It has been estimated that the  President's proposal will cause residen tial gas bills nationwide to soar 67 per cent by 1986 and cost Americans an  additional $50 billion  in natural gas  costs. Such decontrol would also cost  an average Des Moines area household  that heats with natural gas nearly  $560 in higher gas bills over the next 4  years.  The people of Iowa-along with mil lions  of  other Americans-deserve  better. They deserve  to be protected  from price gouging companies who do  not care about the consumer. For this  reason I have  joined 93 Members of  the House in cosponsoring H.R. 2154,  the Natural Gas Consumer Relief Act  of 1983. This bill tackles the shortcom ings of the NGPA head on. The bill:  Rolls back costs to what they were  in January 1982.  Extends for another 2 years controls  on 60 percent of the natural gas now  scheduled for decontrol in 1985 under  theNGPA.  Provides  strict  limits on  the con tracts pipeline  companies  can  sign.  Contract  proviSions  which  require  pipelines to pay the highest price of  any other contract  in a  given geo graphic area and other abusive provi sions would be  illegal. The pipeline  companies would be  required  to  re negotiate  their  present  high-priced  contracts  that violate  the  law,  and  they would be required  to purchase  the cheapest gas available.  Requires the Federal Energy Regu latory Commission <FERC) to limit a  pipeline's passthrough of gas costs to  the extent the pipeline has failed to  adopt and follow practices which mini mize its gas costs. This is an important  provision since FERC now allows pipe lines to pass almost any costs, whether  prudently  or  imprudently  incurred,  along to consumers.  Prohibit FERC from administrative ly raising gas prices. Through adminis trative action, FERC has allowed gas  producers to charge an extra amount  for production costs associated with  producing natural  gas. Historically,  these costs have been included in the  ceiling price. But, by regulation, FERC  has decided that price ceilings should  no longer include these costs. The net  result is a $10 billion increase in natu ral gas bills over the next 4 years. The  FERC has also administratively ex panded the definition of certain cate9331  gories of higher-priced gas. Under the  bill I have cosponsored,  the decision  on production costs would be reversed,  and  the Commission would  lose  its  ability to boost gas prices higher.  The Natural Gas Consumer Relief  Act, if passed by Congress, will lower  natural gas prices. For example,  the  average Des Moines-area household  will save $780 over the next 4 years  compared to current law, rather than  paying the $560 more under the Presi dent's decontrol plan.  The Natural Gas Consumer Relief  Act of 1983 offers a sound approach  for bringing about  lower prices  for  natural gas. The bill will correct the  serious deficiencies of the Natural Gas  Policy Act and will help restore fair ness and equity  to  the natural gas  market.  I  strongly support  this  legislation  and hope Congress will act soon in en acting this measure.e  CONSUMERS PAY FOR GAS  DECONTROL  HON.

612,1091,7,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to share with my colleagues an on  ed piece on natural gas from the April  18, 1983, edition of the Philadelphia  Inquirer.  This well  reasoned  and  timely  article was written  by Mr.  Randy Canale, chairman of the Penn sylvania Public Interest Energy Com mittee and president of the Delaware  County AFL-CIO Council.  I whole heartedly support this position.  The article follows:  CONSUMERS PAY FOR GAS DECONTROL  <By Randy Canale>  Just about everyone agrees that soaring  natural gas prices are a big problem. Not  only consumers who heat with gas, but  farmers, small businesses, major industries  and even gas ultilities and pipelines are  bearing the burden of gas costs that have  doubled since 1978. That is when Congress  passed the Natural Gas Policy Act <NGPA>  to phase out the controls that held down  well-head gas prices.  Even  the oil companies, which produce  most of  the nation's natural  gas,  have  changed their tune. Abandoning their old  complaint that gas prices are kept artificial ly low by federal regulation, the oil compa nies now are trying to convince us that the  remaining price controls are keeping gas  prices too high.  Just as oil prices fell after oil was decon trolled, they say, so would natural gas prices  fall in a totally decontrolled ""free market.""  In their view, the phased decontrol of the  NGPA is not enough-more gas must be de controlled faster.  It's a strange and wondrous argument the  oil  companies make. Why  the  sudden  change in rhetoric? Were they simply mis taken before, when they told us that con trols kept prices too low? And if decontrol  ",1983

Quite to  the contrary; what it does is to reafI '  for our  firm United States support  NATO allies.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
614,1104,7,Mr. ZABLOCKI.," I yield to the gen tleman from Oregon.  Mr. AuCOIN. I appreciate the gen tleman yielding to me. The gentleman  from Georgia told the Members of the  House  that  unless we  adopt  the  Carney amendment we will somehow  be selling out our NATO allies and he  said this vote will be a test of our com mitment to NATO.  I  just want  to suggest to my col leagues, and I hope they are listening,  and  I hope  they are  listening even  though they may not be on the floor,  that we do not have to give  to our  NATO allies veto power over the trea tymaking powers of the United States  President in order to have a commit ment to them. We have not given such  veto power to our allies, in the START  negotiations or  in  the IMF negotia tions-nor should we if we get to nego tiations on a freeze. Doing so should  never be the test of our dedication or  commitment to NATO.  Our commitment ought to be to the  sovereign  right of  this  country  to  enter into bilateral  treaties. That is  why the Zablocki amendment should  be  adopted,  and  that  is why  the  Carney amendment ought  to be de feated.  The CHAIRMAN.

616,1117,7,Mr.  LEVITAS.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  I oppose the amendment strictly on  the basis that it is quite clear that the  President has  the authority at any  time to withdraw from negotiations in  which this country is placed whether  House Joint Resolution 13  becomes  law or does not become law, which is  highly doubtful in any event. I think  it would set a bad precedent to put  any restriction on that.  However, I do think that the gentle man from New Jersey (Mr. CouRTER)  has served a very admirable purpose  by offering his amendment because he  has now made it a matter of record by  those who are the most strong propo nents of House Joint Resolution 13  that the President unilaterally would  have the right to do what the gentle man's amendment would have done  under a special procedure, and I think  that is very constructive.  I  think the debate also serves an other purpose. It suggests that there  may or may not be dilatory  tactics  that are being engaged in to consume  the amount of time that has been lim ited, but it certainly demonstrates the  fact that even on an amendment of  this sort there was some need for elu cidation and explanation that it is not  going to be permitted under the proce dures which have thus far been adopt ed.  So I urge defeat of the amendment.  I think the debate has served a good  purpose in bringing out several points.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1983
617,1117,7,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Chairman, be cause of the language and the dialog  we have had here, I ask unanimous  consent to withdraw the amendment  at this point.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore.  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  amendment is withdrawn.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. STRATTON  ",1983
618,1117,7,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. STRATTON: At  the end of the resolution, add the following  new section:  ""SEC.  . VERIFICATION OF ARMS CONTROL AGREE MENTS.  ""(a) Consistent with Public Law 87-297, as  amended, nothing in this Act shall be con strued to require the President to negotiate  any international arms control agreement if  the President certifies to the Congress that  each element of such agreement cannot be  adequately verified.  ""(b) For the purposes of this section, the  President shall assume  that measures of  concealment would be employed and that  standards practices could be altered so as to  impede verification.  ""(c) For the purposes of this section, the  elements to be verified shall include, but not  be limited to, whether the Soviet Union may  or may not, be testing, producing, or deploy ing nuclear warheads, missiles, or other de livery systems. The term 'other delivery sys tems' shall be construed to mean any air craft, surface ship, submarine, ballistic mis sile, cruise missile, artillery tube or space  system designed for the delivery of nuclear  weapons or which could be modified for the  purpose of delivering nuclear weapons.  ""(d) Nothing in this section shall be con strued as requiring the disclosure of sensi tive national security or intelligence sources  or methods or persons employed in the veri fication of compliance with an arms control  agreement.""  ",1983
619,1117,7,Mr.  STRATTON.," Mr.  Chairman,  this resolution, if we are going to be  dealing with it seriously, mentions the  word ""verifiable"" a number of times.  The resolution also goes on to direct  the President to negotiate on various  items  that will  result  in  a  freeze  treaty. Several of the items that are to  be negotiated in a ""verifiable"" treaty  are the testing, producing, and deploy ing of nuclear warheads, missiles, or  other delivery systems.  Those  terms are not words of art  and are therefore subject to various  meanings, yet the joint resolution con tains no definitions of what ""delivery  systems"" are.  The Arms Control and Disarmament  Act was amended in 1977  to express  the policy of Congress that ""adequate  verification of compliance should be  an indispensible part of any interna tional arms control agreement.""  Because the joint resolution is silent  on the matter of verification policy,  we have to have some kind of clarifica tion. My amendment would provide  that clarification by incorporating cur rent policy on the subject of verifica tion.  The amendment does three precise  things. It includes, first of all, a state ment that is taken directly from the  basic arms control law, Public Law 87297, which says that nothing in the  law shall be construed to require the  President to negotiate any agreement  if the President certifies to Congress  that each element of such agreement  cannot be adequately verified.  Second, it calls to the attention of  the House and of the President that  we have to assume that measures of  concealment will be employed by our  adversary, and that standard practices  would be altered as to impede verifica tion.  Third, we say that for the purpose  of this section, it should include, but  not be limited to such items as wheth er the Soviet Union may or may not be  testing, producing, or deploying nucle ar warheads, missiles, or other delivery  systems. But that term ""other delivery  systems,"" which has been mentioned  previously in discussion of this legisla tion, is not defined in the legislation.  Amendment spells out what we mean  by ""delivery systems"":        any aircraft, surface ship, submarine,  ballistic missile,  cruise missile,  artillery  tube, or space system designed for the deliv ery of nuclear weapons or which could be  modified for the purpose of delivering nu clear weapons.  And finally, any amendment says:  Nothing in this section shall be construed  as requiring the disclosure of sensitive na tional security or  intelligence  sources or  methods or persons employed in the verifi cation of compliance with an arms control  agreement.  That wording is also taken directly  out of the arms control legislation.  I  think  this kind  of  amendment  needs to be incorporated in the legisla tion because of the obvious likelihood  that we will  find  that many  things  cannot  in fact be verified. We must  assume  that the Soviet Union, as  it  has done with regard to other treaties,  will be undertaking measures of con cealment which would make verifica tion unlikely, difficult, or impossible.  Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to  remember the words of President Ken nedy:  We know enough about broken negotia tions,  secret preparation, and  the advan tages gained from a long test series never to  offer  again  an  uninspected moratorium.  Some urge us to try it again      we have  explored  this alternative  thoroughly and  found it impossible of execution.  Mr. Chairman, the joint resolution  mentions the term ""verifiable"" many  times. The resolution goes on to direct  the President to negotiate on various  terms that hopefully would result in a  freeze treaty. Several items that are to  be negotiated in a verifiable treaty are  the testing, producing, or deploying of  nuclear warheads, missiles, or other  delivery systems.  The  terms ""testing,"" ""production,""  ""deployment,"" and ""other delivery sys tems"" are not words of art and are  subject to various meanings.  The  joint  resolution  contains  definitions.  The Arms Control and Disarmament  Act was amended in 1977  to express  the policy of the Congress that ""ade quate  verification  of  compliance  should be an indispensable part of any  international  arms  control  agree ment.""  Because the joint resolution is silent  on the matter of verification policy,  clarification is required. This amendno  ",1983
620,1130,7,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Chairman, as  a cosponsor of House Joint Resolution  13, I rise to strongly urge its passage.  A nuclear weapons freeze  is a vital  first step in reversing the insane and  wasteful  arms  race.  I  also  rise  to  strongly  oppose  the many  amend ments which have been offered  to  House Joint Resolution 13  to cripple  its  intent. While  these amendments  have the appearance of calling for re ductions in our nuclear arsenals, they  are only masquerades for the continu ation of the arms race at astronomical  levels.  The fact is that the United States  and the Soviet Union have far exceed ed the nuclear firepower necessary to  deter each other from launching a nu clear attack. The Soviets clearly know  that a first strike on the United States  would be  followed by  retaliation so  devastating that the U.S.S.R. would be  returned to the stone-age; indeed, in a  recent article for foreign policy, Leon  Sigal, guest scholar at the Brookings  Institute noted:  One Trident  submarine  alone  carries  enough nuclear warheads  to destroy 192  Soviet cities or targets of comparable value.  Three of the most modem class of Soviet  submarines have equivalent value. This reci procity  satisfies  the  requirement  in U.S.  strategic doctrine  for mutual assured de struction.  Opponents of the nuclear freeze say  that it will undermine President Rea gan's arms control efforts. The fact is  that those efforts are ephemeral.  The President has called  for  the  United States to create the ability to  fight a ""prolongd nuclear war"" in his  defense guidance. The administration  is planning a massive $1.6 trillion ex penditure over the next 5 years on nu clear weapons. It plans to build 17,000  nuclear warheads, new seaand land based missiles, cruise missiles, nuclear  submarines  and  strategic  bombers,  space weapons and chemical and bio logical weapons. The administration  has refused to push for the ratifica tion of SALT II, abandoned negotia tions  for a  comprehensive  test ban  <CTB> treaty, sought major changes in  the peaceful nuclear explosions <PNE)  treaty  and  the  threshold  test ban  <TTB) treaty, and proposed abrogation  of  the  treaty  limiting  spaced-based  weaponry. It has proposed $4.5 million  for civil defense,  including  the  ludi crous plans for delivering mail after a  nuclear holocaust. President Reagan  appointed Kenneth Adelman-whose  disdain for arms control is exceeded  only by his ignorance of disarmament  issues-to head the Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency.  The President most  recently  un veiled plans for a  large research and  development program for an antibal listic missile system-which may  re quire abrogating the antiballistic mis sile treaty, one of the most important  arms control agreements between the  United States and the Soviet Union to  date. This proposal would certainly set  off a new round in the arms race, as  each side attempts to develop counter measures to the other side's defenses.  Those countermeasures will likely in clude an accelerated stockpile of war heads to saturate the defenses of the  other side.  All of these policies would ironically  decrease our security despite this mul tibillion-dollar cost. They would fuel  the arms race, heighten tensions with  the Soviets, and waste precious  re sources that could be used to increase  our national  security by enhancing  our  economic,  social,  and  political  structures.  Millions of Americans have rejected  the administration's abandonment of  arms control and joined the grassroots  nuclear freeze movement. The resolu tion we are considering today is an ex pression of this widespread public sup port for arms control and has as its  prime objective pressuring the Presi dent to pursue realistic arms and arms  control policies.  The resolution calls on the United  States and U.S.S.R.  to negotiate  a  mutual and verifiable  freeze  in the  testing, production, and. deployment of  nuclear weapons. Such an agreement  would halt the senseless expansion of  Soviet  as well  as U.S.  arsenals.  It  would  directly  benefit  the United  States by freezing Soviet moderniza tion of warhead technologies. The res olution places priority on agreements  eliminating  the most  destabilizing  weapons, particularly those with high  accuracy, multiple warheads, large ex plosive power and short flight  time.  Such weapons have the appearance-if  not  the  actual  capability-of  first strike capability and could force  the  United States and U.S.S.R.  to adopt  launch-on-warning policies, greatly in creasing the chance of accidental nu clear war.  The resolution calls for agreements  to freeze the growth of nuclear arse nals to be followed by substantial and  equitable  reductions. The  resolution  also emphasizes that any arms control  agreement hinges on adequate guaran tees of verification and compliance.  In addition  to  increasing our mili tary security and stability, a  freeze  would greatly enhance our economic  security by saving an estimated $90  billion over the next 5 years.  It is long past time we defined na tional security  in terms beyond new  weapons systems. National security re quires educated children and trained  workers. It requires a strong healthy  industrial base and expanded scientific  research and development. It requires  a healthy, productive population. If  we neglect our children, our jobs, our  industry, our health care,  then no  amount of weapons will save us.  House Joint Resolution 13 is one of  the most vital measures we will deal  with in this Congress. I urge my col leagues to support it and join millions  of Americans in rejecting the insanity  of the nuclear arms race.e  e ",1983
621,1130,7,Mr. COATS.," Mr. Chairman, one of  the traps into which many of us have  fallen is this: we hold on to an idea or  a position even after a better idea has  come along to replace it.  We are certainly all concerned about  the arms race, about the spread of nu clear weapons. And we are all search ing for a means to reduce the threat  posed by  the  continued production  and deployment of nuclear weapons.  The nuclear freeze proposal has had  a great deal of popular support, not  because it is necessarily the best idea  or the only solution to the problem,  but because it has served to focus our  attention on a critical issue. In this re spect, the freeze has been important  to the nuclear arms debate. It has got  us thinking and talking about an issue  which affects our lives and the lives of  our children.

622,1143,7,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, the first gathering of American  survivors  of  the  Nazi  Holocaust  against  the Jews was held here  in  Washington. The suffering that was  inflicted on  those survivors, and on  the millions of European Jews who did  not survive, can,  in  some sense, be  traced to the Turkish massacre of the  Armenians that we recall today. For  Adolf Hitler, in justifying his ""Final  Solution,""  is  reported  to have said,  ""Who today remembers the massacre  of the Armenians?""  In observing Armenian Martyrs Day,  we seek to insure that the massacre of  more than 1% million Armenians will  not be forgotten. There are those who  seek to deny the historical fact of the  Armenian genocide. Their attempts to  revise history to erase the atrocities  that were committed against the Ar menians, must be overcome.  Only by keeping the memory of past  horrors fresh can we maintain our vig ilance against the possibility of future  genocides. The establishment of the  Holocaust Memorial as part of  the  Smithsonian Museum will  serve  to  educate current and  future genera tions of Americans on the massacre of  the Armenians as well as  the Holo caust  against  the  Jews,  and  help  insure  that  the United States will  always  stand  as  a  bulwark against  genocide.  One action that should be taken in  demonstrating  our  commitment  to  human rights and our understanding  of the lessons of the genocides of the  20th century is the ratification of the  Genocide Convention. For 34 years the  convention has been before the com munity of nations. In that time, some  88 nations have ratified it,  including  every othe major industrial power. Yet  the United States, despite our role as a  leading force for human rights, still  has not ratified.  I have introduced House Resolution  50, which expresses the sense of the  House that the United States should  ratify  the Genocide Convention. Ar menian Martyrs Day, and Holocaust  Memorial ceremonies, provide power ful reminders of the horrors of the  past. The Genocide Convention is the  tool we need to prevent future recur rences of those horrors. On this day, I  urge my colleagues to join me in call ing for U.S. ratification of this vital  international treaty.e   ",1983
623,1143,7,Mrs. JOHNSON.," Mr. Speaker, as a  part of the order to commemorate the  Armenian genocide, sponsored by my  respected  collegue  from California,  CHARLES  PASHAYAN,  I would  like  to  read the following quote:  I have issued the command-and I'll have  anybody who writes but one word of criti cism executed by a firing squad-that our  war aim does not consist in reaching certain  lines, but in the physical destruction of the  enemy. Accordingly,  have  placed my  death-head formations in readiness-for the  present only  in the East-with orders  to  them to send to death mercilessly and with out compassion, men, women and children  of Polish derivation  and  language. Only  thus shall we gain the living space which we  need. Who, after all, speaks today of the an nihilation of the Armenians? 1  I  Mr. Speaker, Adolf Hitler said that  on August 22, 1939, in a speech to su preme commanders and commanding  generals of his army, in the town of  Obersalzberg.  Mr. Speaker, who  indeed does  re member the annihilation of the Arme nians? Yet 68 years ago a million and a  half Armenians were massacred by the  Turkish Government  lead by Talat  Pasha, as part of a premeditated and  organized plan of genocide  that the  Turkish Government  of  today not  only refuses to acknowledge as histori cal fact, but also actively distributes  misinformation about an attempt  to  distort the historical record.  The  full horror of  the massacres  began on the night of April 24, 1915,  when the Turkish police rounded up  all of the Armenian intellectuals from  their homes in Constantinople, effec tively silencing the voice of a genera tion. In the villages, Turkish soldiers  gathered the unarmed Armenian men  into the village square <the Govern ment had already confiscated all weap ons), executed them, and then deport ed the women and children into the  vast Syrian desert. There were  few  survivors.  Today we commemorate a day of  mourning, not only for those who died  in the Armenian genocide, but for all  mankind. The criminals in this crime  of  genocide  are  not  the Turkish  people, but national chauvinism, prej udice  and  fear,  and  the  ultimate  enemy is silence. The genocide itself is  an eternal reminder to all mankind of  the moral obligation we bear to speak  out against persecution, and to main tain a constant vigil for the preserva tion of human rights. If we  fail  in  these obligations, we may well use as  our epitaph these words from George  'Louis Paul, Lochner, What About Germany?,  <New York: Dodd, Mead and Cornwall), 1942.  ",1983
624,1156,7,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Alabama <Mr. SHELBY) is  recognized for 5 minutes.   ",1983
625,1156,7,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  my Subcommittee on Housing and Me morial Affairs began hearings on the  VA housing program. One of the bills  being considered is H.R. 2618 which I  introduced on Tuesday.  This  bill would  provide  financial  relief  to unemployed veteran home owners facing foreclosure. If a veteran,  through no fault of his own, is at least  6 months delinquent in his mortgage  payments, the VA would be authorized  to set up an escrow account  in his  behalf to make him current and pro vide up  to 6 months of additional  relief. This assistance could be  ex tended, if necessary, but in no event  could  the  total monetary  advance  exceed $8,400.  This measure  is specifically geared  to those needy veterans who are suf fering from the effects of unemploy ment, underemployment or serious ill ness. Recent statistics  indicate  that  800,000 Vietnam and disabled veterans  are unemployed.  Mr. Speaker, I feel this is important  legislation  for  us  to  consider. The  economy appears to be on the upswing  but there are many veterans who con tinue to be unemployed. The chances  are good, however, that they will be  able to get back on their feet shortly.  Meanwhile,  foreclosures are at an  alltime high. We must do something  to help our veterans during this inter im period of economic adversity. As  you know,  the House Banking, Fi nance and Urban Affairs Committee  has reported legislation which would  establish  a  new  revolving  fund  to  assist homeowners facing foreclosure  on home mortgage loans not insured  by  the Federal Housing Administra tion or the Farmers Home Administra tion. Although  this measure would  help some veterans, we believe our bill  provides an alternative remedy.  It should be noted that our bill re quires no new money from taxpayers  to provide  this assistance. This program would be funded out of existing  revolving funds currently used to pay  claims.  It  is  possible  that  this bill  could even prove cost effective by sub stituting  this mortgate payment ad vance for the high expenses currently  incurred by the Veterans' Administra tion in paying claims of lenders, insti tuting foreclosure procedures and re selling acquired properties.  I am pleased to say that my bill is  cosponsored by the chairman of the  full committee,  the gentleman from  Mississippi, Mr. SONNY MONTGOMERY;  the ranking minority member of the  subcommittee,  Mr.  CHRISTOPHER  SMITH of New Jersey; Mr. BoB EDGAR  of  Pennsylvania,  the  distinguished  chairman  of  our Subcommittee on  Hnspitals and Health Care and a gen tleman who is known for championing  the cause of all veterans; Mr. LANE  EvANS of Illinois, a Vietnam veteran  and  outstanding member;  and Mr.  BILL RICHARDSON of New Mexico, a dis tinguished member of the subcommit tee who is vitally interested in assist ing veterans in need, especially those  who served in Vietnam.  Mr. Speaker,  it is my intention to  mark up this vital piece of legislation  in the near future.e  e Mr.  NELSON AND WINNIE MANDELA:  HONORARY U.S. CITIZENS  ",1983

I  think  I have made my position  clear. I would just like to have the op portunity to vote for what is my de clared  position.  I  think we  should  insist on a straight repeal of withhold ing.  I fully anticipate the Senator's argu ments, and I just think we could save a  lot of time here, when Senators have  other things to do.  If the Senator wants  to make his  motion to table, the motion that I be lieve he wants  to make,  I would be  glad to yield for that purpose.  ",1983

642,1169,7,Mr. LONG., Yes.  ,1983
643,1169,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I rise to  support the Dole compromise amend ment which would delay withholding  during a  test period  for alternative  compliance measures, and  to oppose  the amendment of the senior Senator  from  Louisiana.  Senator  LONG's  amendment would  repeal  the withholding law rather than delay its im plementation.  In addition,  the Long  amendment would completely nullify  the alternative compliance measures  contained in the compromise as a par tial substitute for comprehensive with holding.  I would ask my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle,  including those on  both sides of the withholding issue, to  join with me in supporting the compromise so that something positive can  emerge from a controversy that has  been so troubling for so many months  to many Members.  I do not quarrel  with the Senator from Louisiana for  seeking a vote on an  issue he has  promised his constituents he would  vote on. I believe that such a vote is  unnecessary, but I can understand the  political  considerations  that  may  prompt the desire for such a vote.  I do have some concerns, however,  about  the  provisions  of  the Long  amendment  that  would  not  only  repeal withholding, but also prevent a  series of well-thought-out alternative  compliance  measures  from  taking  effect.  The revenue estimators of the Joint  Committee on Taxation  tell us that  our backup withholding provisions, in creased payor penalties, and authori zation of additional resources for the  IRS  will,  given  sufficient  follow through in the appropriations process,  save  a  considerable portion of  the  $13.4 billion that would otherwise be  given away by the Long amendment. I  should point out that this is because  the  IRS and Treasury now believe  that backup withholding  is practica ble, but I should also point out that  the IRS has not had very much time  to study  this compromise  that was  worked out in 3 hours. So the esti mates could change. Also, the House  of Representatives may come up with  a better alternative.  Although  the  IRS and  the  joint  committee advise us  that attaching  1099 forms to individual returns will  not improve compliance, some Mem bers feel it will. I must admit, it seems  to me  there may be some advanta geous, psychological effect on compli ance  from  requiring attachment of  1099 forms, I am not an expert, and  the experts disagree, but we have in cluded that to make an honest effort  at improving compliance.  Frankly, I cannot understand the ar gument, from a tax policy perspective,  for repealing withholding and putting  nothing in its place. The only argu ment  against withholding  that has  ever made any sense to me has been:  Maybe there  is a better way  to  im prove  compliance. Hire more  IRS  agents, give them more effective tools,  improve the quality of information re porting documents, at least give  this  all a try before making the big jump  to withholding.  I know the attractiveness of this po sition, because that was where I stood  when President Reagan originally pro posed  withholding  in  last  year's  budget.  I came to believe that it is the wrong  position, since I was advised by the tax  compliance experts that while our al ternative can help, it will never be as  effective or efficient as withholding.  But I am a realist, and I support get ting some improvement in tax compli ance rather than none at all.  I can count. I can understand the re duced revenue estimates from this al ternative  compared  to withholding.  But I can also count votes, and believe  I know when to compromise for the  public interest.  We don't have the votes to improve  tax  compliance  by  $13.4  billion  through withholding-$17. 7 billion in  total-but I hope we would have the  votes to improve compliance by $8.2  billion on withholding-$12.5 billion in  total. That is politics, and I can under stand it. I don't like it or agree with it,  but I can accept it.  It  is a different story  to say we  should vote against doing anything to  improve tax compliance. I do not be lieve  there  is a  single Senator who  does not think we should improve tax  compliance. But I am concerned that a  vote  to  repeal withholding and put  nothing  in  its place would be per ceived, inaccurately, as a vote to toler ate tax fraud and noncompliance.  The compromise we have reached is  not a substitute for withholding. It is  not even a second best alternative to  withholding. It is probably the third  or fourth best alternative to withhold ing, depending on whether Congress  later agrees to appropriate sufficient  funds for the IRS to implement this  compromise. But  the compromise  is  better  than  approving  the  Long  amendment.  It loses less revenue, it produces a  fairer  tax  system,  and  it  sends  a  healthier message  to  the American  taxpayer.  In short,  it  is better  tax  policy. Not  the best,  perhaps, but  better.  I ask unanimous consent to include  in the RECORD a table summarizing in formation concerning the revenue esti",1983
644,1195,7,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, it  is my intention in just a few minutes  to move to table this amendment.  Let me say, first of all, that I very  much respect  the position  that was  taken by the Senator from Pennsylva nia and taken by the Senator from  West Virginia.  I  totally agree  that  clearly we  do not want a  country  solely of services and high tech. We  have to be able to make things and we  have to be able to enforce the law. It is  a violation of law, international law, to  ship subsidized goods into this country  and it is a violation of law to dump.  We have to enforce the law. There is  no doubt about that. There is no argu ment on that.  Those who say that our industry is  sick and that it has to be fixed and  that we need doctors on the scene,  they are absolutely right. The ques tion is, how is the law to be enforced?  That is the question that is posed by  this amendment. The problem with  the Specter amendment is that it vio lates the General Agreement on Tar iffs and Trade.  Now we can either enforce the law in  a way that is consistent with interna tional agreements or we can ourselves  violate the law, violate  international  agreements.

ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL ESOP  COMPANY  ",1983
651,1247,7,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, it was re cently my great pleasure to visit with  Mr. Warren Braun, president of Com Sonics, Inc., a very successful company  located in Harrisonburg, Va. In these  severe economic times, it is encourag ing to know that there are companies  such as ComSonics, Inc., which are not  only weathering the storm but actual ly prospering.  ComSonics was recently recognized  by INC. magazine as one of the lead ing privately held companies  in  the  United  States with  a  269-percent  growth rate over the past 5 years. Mr.  Braun attributes much of that success  to the fact that ComSonics has an em ployee stock ownership plan <ESOP>.  While more  traditionally  owned  competitors  are  struggling  to  stay  afloat, this ESOP company continues  to surge ahead. Like many good man agers, Mr. Braun recognized a number  of years ago that his employees are his  company's most  important  asset.  Thus, in 1975, he established a plan to  insure that his company become their  company as well.  That  farsighted  approach  has  worked  to  the benefit of everyone.  The employees now share in the suc cess that they helped to create; Mr.  Braun's own stock has grown in value;  and the Federal Government is ahead  as well,  as ComSonics' growth has  meant not only more  jobs but more  tax revenue as well.  Mr. President, it is gratifying to find  that the ESOP legislation that I have  sponsored over the past several years  is being utilized and is enjoying such  great  success.  I  am  convinced  that  widespread employee stock ownership  can make a substantial contribution to  reviving America's productive might.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a company profile of Com Sonics, Inc. be inserted in the RECORD  at this point.  There being no objection, the profile  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  COMPANY PROFILE  ComSonics,  Inc.  is winning  the battle  against  recession, depressed earnings and  the general economic downturn suffered by  most businesses, even with continued high  investment  in  research and development.  The Corporation's impressive growth record  was recently recognized by INC. Magazine  citing it as one of the top U.S. privately held  corporations with a 269 percent growth over  the past five years. Even at present,  the  Corporation continues to grow at a substan tial rate mirroring the substantive base to  its growth history.  Commenting on the INC. Magazine's rec ognition as  the 457th growth corporation  out of over 11,000 U.S. privately held corpo rations, President Braun said, ""It's our em ployees-and ESOP."" ""Great people with a  meaningful incentive make for a great com pany.""  This all  started  in 1970 when Warren  Braun, a consulting engineer in the cable  television industry, saw the need for an in dependent research and development firm  that would provide a wide variety of techni cal services for CATV systems. The  idea  took shape as ComSonics in 1972, as Braun,  a group of young engineers, and Braun's  wife, Dickie, working out of  the Braun's  basement as a consulting firm launched the  new venture. Now eleven years later, with  approximately 89 employees, the Brauns are  seeing  another  idea  come  to  fruition,  namely  the  transformation of ComSonics  into an employee-owned corporation.  Braun, who serves as president and gener al manager, believes it's the only fair thing  to do. ""What better way can appreciation be  expressed to those who helped found a com pany and contributed to its success than to  make those employee company owners?"" he  asked. In 1975, Braun established a  trust  with 25,000 shares of newly issued common  stock which were bought with funding pro vided by the corporation. The next year an  additional 72,000 shares were bought from  funds borrowed by a local bank. The 96,000  shares are allocated to ComSonics' employ ees, making  the  firm wholly  employee owned.  The purpose of the ComSonics employee  stock ownership plan <ESOP) is to assist the  employee to accumulate stock ownership in  the firm, thus providing the employee and  the employee's family with further econom ic security. Stated Braun, ""It has always  been my firm belief that employees contrib ute to the growth of a company as much as  capital,  and  employees  should  therefore  participate in that growth. The major prob lem with that idea was how could employees  participate without confronting an immedi ate  tax  liability. The  solution was  the  ESOP. All employees will only pay taxes on  accumulated capital when it is withdrawn  from the trust as a stock certificate, when  the employee retires, dies, or leave the com pany.  The key to the transfer of ownership de pends upon the growth of the company. At  the end of each fiscal year (July 31) Com Somes' Board decides how much additional  money can be put into trust for stock pur chase in the ESOP with the ultimate objec tive to purchase all of the remaining stock  of the corporation currently owned by the  principal employee stockholder, Braun, for  the remainder of  the employees. Eligible  employees are those who are 24 years of age  and have completed at least 1,000 hours of  service during the first 12 months of em ployment. The yearly portion is determined  by how much ComSonics contributes to the  trust. ComSonics's contribution to the trust  is derived by the corporation's earnings. In  turn,  the ComSonics' contribution  to  the  trust is divided by the new per-share-stock  value. These shares are then set aside for  the eligible ComSonics employees. An em ployee's portion is based upon the percent  of compensation in relation to the total eli gible payroll.  Knowing what's at stake, ComSonics' em ployees  are more  conscientious  of  their  work.  ""They act more  like  stockholders  than employees,""  said Braun,  ""which  is  what they are."" The Brauns are extremely  proud of their employees. ""We've collective ly had our shoulders to the wheel from the  time we started this company to make it  what it is today.""  Today, most of those ""boys from the base ment"" are still with ComSonics. They head  the  four profit centers of  the company:  Dennis Zimmerman, Vice President, Sys tems Services; Carl Hensley, Vice President,  Internal Operations; Richard Shimp, Vice  President, Research and Corporate Develop ment;  and Glen Shomo, Vice President,  Product Production and Development. Mrs.  Braun serves as corporate secretary/treas urer and remains active in the firm's day to  day activity. The ESOP idea was prompted  in part by their loyalty and dedication to  ComSonics. ""People who work so long and  hard as  these men did  to help start this  company deserve something of importance  in  return,""  stated Braun.  ""Other  stock  bonus plans tend to have near term tax con sequences, and are usually heavily weighed  for upper income personnel. ESPOs benefit  every worker.""  During this short life, ComSonics has gen erated an impressive list of new and unique  ideas represented by several U.S. and for eign patents.  Hensley, Zimmerman, and Shimp  rank  highest on the seniority list, but they have  also set a trend. The employee turnover at  ComSonics  for  full-time workers  is only  around three percent per year.  ComSonics is managed by advance man agement-by-objective <MBO)  techniques. It  is run by the department heads who are  guided by objectives they set each year. The  company  has  a management  consultant  John Dickie who also provides extensive in house  training  programs. Any  employee  who wants further training and education in  his job area can pursue it at the company's  expense. For grades of an A or B, the com pany will pay 100 percent of the expenses.  One aspect of the management system is  the annual company performance objective.  This involves another form of profit-shar ing, apart from the ESOP. Braun explained  that each year a dollar amount is projected  for the company's performance. If the per formance objective is met, 50 percent of the  profit earned over the objective is distribut ed directly to all employees  in cash. The  other 50 percent goes  into advancing  the  corporate expansion. This year  the fiscal  corporate growth is 33 percent to date, ex emplifying continued compound growth.  The newest and most recent company in centive is the Employee of the Year award.  This award was devised and proposed by the  second-level management personnel without  ",1983
652,1260,7,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation to broaden  and strengthen our Nation's social se curity  system  and  to  insure  every  working American  the right  to save  and invest in a private account for his  or her own retirement security.  My bill,  the Individual Retirement  Security Act of 1983,  is  identical  to  title 1 of S. 541,  the Social Security  Guarantee and Individual Retirement  Act of 1983, a comprehensive social se curity  reform bill  I  introduced  this  past February. Even though Congress  has passed a bailout which purports to  help social security meet its financial  obligations for a few more years, we  must continue to look at alternatives  for  real  reform  that will make  the  system sound.  Americans deserve more  than  the  present bankrupt retirement system.  Not until  social  security's financial  crisis made the headlines last year did  many working men and women learn  how  their Government-sponsored  re tirement system works. I have bushels  of letters from individuals who honest ly believe their payroll taxes were ac cumulating  in an  account here  in  Washington,  awaiting  their  retire ment. They  could not believe  that  social security  is  little more  than a  petty cash fund, where tax money col lected this week is paid out in benefits  next week. And I am sure they were  also shocked to learn that their pay roll taxes were not enough to pay ex isting obligations and that even higher  taxes would be needed.  I hope Americans will not be lulled  into any false sense of security by the  recently  enacted  bailout  package.  Even if it succeeds in paying the bills  until 1990 or so, the prospect of total  collapse of the social security system  still looms ahead.  Mr. President, the bill I am introduc ing would  offer working men  and  women an alternative-or should I say  a  supplement-to  the present bank rupt,  Government-run  retirement  system.  ",1983
653,1312,7,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  today  marks  the 75th anniversary of  the  New York County Lawyers Associa tion. For 75  years,  the New York  County Lawyers Association <NYCLA)  has served the bar, the bench, and the  public in an effort to insure that our  legal  system works  effectively. The  work that its lawyers have done can  only serve to act as a model for many  throughout the Nation.  On this day, 75 years ago, 143 ""attor neys or counselors of  the Supreme  Court of New York State  in active  practice, residing or having our office  in New York County"" officially incor porated the New York County Law yer's Association. This year, NYCLA's  Diamond Jubilee Year,  the original  143 lawyers of the association have in creased to over 10,000.  Since its founding in 1908, NYCLA  has devoted itself to serving the com munity. This commitment to service is  exemplified by the practical legal edu cation <PLE) series, the work of scores  of committees, and the dedication of  the library and administrative staffs  to the ideals of the New York County  Lawyers Association.  The center of these activities is the  ""Home of Law,"" NYCLA's landmarked  building at 14 Vesey Street, with its  nobly proportioned auditorium mod eled after Independence Hall in Phila delphia. There, and  in  the various  meeting rooms, members gather regu larly to do the work of the commit tees, to be enriched by PLE courses,  luncheon forums, panel discussions at  forum evenings and special symposia.  Social  pleasures  include  these  and  other events such as the Annual Re ception for the Judiciary, and gather ings in honor of distinguished Ameri cans and foreign visitors.  The New York County Lawyers' As sociation, one of  the  largest county  bar associations in the United States,  has long held a leadership position in  New York City,  legal capital of  the  world. Membership  is  drawn  from  every section of the profession: The  judiciary and court staffs, elected and  appointed government officials,  law yers from the largest law firms, and  single practitioners and newly admit ted attorneys.  NYCLA  is  proud  to  have  been  among the first bar associations in the  country to sweep away all race, sex,  and color barriers to membership, and  to have been one of the earliest bar as sociation authorities on professional  ethics.  From its inception, NYCLA has rec ognized a  responsibility  to serve the  profession and the public generally not only major firms but also  those  with more modest practices and public  interest groups-so that cost effective  legal services, determined by ability to  pay, may be made available  to  the  public.  virtually no aspect of legal practice,  domestic or foreign, is unrepresented.  Committee  reports  frequently  lead  to administrative reform and legisla tive change and amendment. In 1948,  for  example, NYCLA  launched  an  attack on court calendar congestion  which resulted in legislation and the  appointment of special pretrial refer ees in negligence cases. In 1952, the as sociation  recommended  to Congress  that ""immediate action be  taken  to  insure  the  adoption of appropriate  rules and regulations  to govern and  control the operation of all investigat ing committees"", resulting in hearings  by  the House Rules Committee.  In  1977, responding to a crisis caused by  overwhelming volume  in  the motion  part of the Supreme Court, New York  County, NYCLA's voluntary assistance  to the courts program developed a spe cial masters program, resulting in the  creation of a special term, part lA, and  referral of thousands of cases to sever al hundred volunteer  attorneys.  In  1982, several recommendations for ad ministrative changes reported out by  the Committee on the Federal Courts  were accepted by the Chief Judge of  the U.S. Court of Appeals, 2d Circuit.  Committees,  as  appropriate, meet  with the judiciary and court staffs to  discuss mutual  problems, whether  originating with the court or practi tioners. The informal setting and tone  of such meetings are no small factors  in the achievement of greater under standing and efficiency.  NYCLA is unusual, if not unique, in  the accessibility of committee assign ments  to all of  its members. As  a  result, our younger  lawyers-in  the  first 10 years of professional practice constituting approximately 40 percent  of our membership, are exceptionally  active.  NYCLA  committees  comment  on  proposals by the New York State and  American Bar Associations, in matters  impacting on the legal profession and  the public, Government  involvement  affecting the profession, and a wide  range of subjects of  import  to  the  practitioner.  PRACTICAL LEGAL EDUCATION  The PLE series was initiated in 1974.  Courses range from the basic, ""Gener al Practice for the Newly Admitted At torney,"" given every year, to such spe cialties  as  estate,  bankruptcy,  tax ation, matrimonial, real estate, and im migration  practice.  In  cooperation  with  Presiding  Justice  Francis  T.  Murphy, J~ .  of the appellate division,  first  department,  and  its  office  of  The New York County Lawyers' Asprojects  development,  seminars  on  sociation serves bench, bar, and the ' trial and appellate advocacy as well as  public through its committees.

654,1364,7,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased to introduced legislation today  to authorize the Army Corps of Engi neers  to deepen  the channel  in the  Green Bay Port from 24 to 27 feet.  This legislation results from sugges tions  for port development and  im provement made by officials of  the  Green Bay Port. The long-term health  of the port and its users depends on  full accessibility  to the port by any  size ship  to be found on the Great  Lakes.  At the present time, the Fox River  channel in Green Bay is 24 feet deep.  The Saint Lawrence Seaway, however,  allows ships of 27 feet into the Great  Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean. Thus,  in order to attract any and all traffic  that moves  through the seaway, the  channel must be dredged to 27 feet.  While the percentage of Green Bay's  freight  traffic  resulting  from  the  Seaway  is  small now,  the Port of  Green Bay and its representatives are  looking to the future and planning for  increased export and import traffic. I  compliment  them on  their  forward looking attitude.  Because  the average corps project  takes better than 20 years from start  to finish, I believe it is essential that  planning begin now  for  the  future  needs of Green Bay's port. I therefore  urge the members of the Public Works  and Transportation Committee to sup port this legislation and incorporate it  in  the  fiscal  year 1984 Water Re sources authorization legislation.

655,1364,7,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to call to the attention of my col leagues the following thought-provok ing  column  in  today's Washington  Post by George Will:  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 19831  BLIND EYE ON CENTRAL AMERicA  <By George F. Will)  To begin, a two-question quiz.  First question: since d~tente was codified  at the Nixon-Brezhnev summit in 1973, the  Soviet Union has forced a nuclear alert by  threatening to intervene with troops in the  October 1973 war in the Middle East <a war  incited and financed by the Soviet Union>;  has organized and financed the destruction  of the Paris accords and a U.S. ally; has in tervened with Cubans and others in Angola,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ethiopia, Yemen, Cambodia, Nicaragua and  El Salvador; has invaded Afghanistan; has  orchestrated  the crushing of Poland; has  made a mockery of the Helsinki agreements;  has  repeatedly  violated  the  informally  agreed-to  threshold  test ban  treaty <al though we even changed the way we meas ure violations, in an effort to avoid the need  to make protests that would dampen de tente>; has tried to murder the pope; is vio lating the terms of SALT II (an amazing  feat, considering that SALT II is a tissue of  loopholes and ambiguities>; is funding and  organizing terrorism worldwide; and is con tinuing an arms buildup unambiguously de signed for political  intimidation and mili tary aggression. The first quiz question is:  why is there a ""return to the Cold War""?  Answer: President Reagan gave a speech  referring  to  the Soviet Union as an evil  empire.  Second question: the Soviet Union has an  army brigade (2,600-3,000 men), 2,500 mili tary advisers (increased 500 last year) and  6,000-8,000 civilian advisers in Cuba. It gave  Cuba 66,000 metric tons of military supplies  in 1981, 68,000  in 1982 <worth $1 billion).  Moscow's annual economic aid to Cuba is $4  billion <more  than one-quarter of Cuba's  GNP>. Cuba has 200 MiGs,  including  two  squadrons of MiG-23 Floggers, at least 650  tanks,  at  least  90  helicopters,  including  MI24 attack helicopters, a Koni-class frig ate, two Foxtrot attack submarines, at least  50 torpedo attack boats, two amphibious as sault ships. A Grenada minister says Cuba  will use Grenada's new airport when supply ing Cubans in Africa. Cuba, with one-sev enth of Mexico's population, has military  forces twice the size of Mexico's. The Soviet  Union is giving 20  times more military as sistance to Cuba than the United States is  giving to all of Latin America. In the newest  Soviet satellite, Nicaragua, 39 percent of all  males over  18  are  in uniform,  and  the  regime  intends  to build a  250,000-person  armed force, so one in 10 Nicaraguans will  soon be in the military or militia. <All of  Honduras' security forces  total 20,000. El  Salvador's total 32,000.) Nicaragua's regime  has built 36 new military bases and garri sons <the previous regime had 13). Nicara guan pilots and mechanics are being trained  in Bulgaria. The regime has received, so far,  50 Soviet tanks, 1,000 East German trucks,  100 anti-aircraft guns, Soviet !52-millimeter  howitzers with a range of 17 miles. Cuba has  4,000 to 5,000 civilian advisers in Nicaragua,  plus 2,000 military and security advisers.  There also are East Germans, Bulgarians,  North Koreas, Soviets and members of the  PLO. The second quiz question  is: about  what  in Central America does Congress  seem most worried?  Answer: fifty-five U.S. trainers in El Sal vador.  Events  in Central America are spinning  rapidly toward a decisive moment in U.S.  history. None of the fictions that were used  to rationalize acceptance of defeat in Viet nam can be used regarding Central America.  The threat there is close, clear and indisput ably communist. There the United States  will  show-will  learn-whether  it  is  any  longer capable of asserting the will a great  power requires, or whether the slide into pa ralysis is irreversible.  Governments such as Costa Rica's and  Panama's are  listening  as  congressional  complaints mount.  The  complaints  are  against U.S. assistance to armed opponents  of Nicaragua's Stalinists, and about even  minimal aid for the democratically elected  government of El Salvador that is under  April 21, 1983  attack  from  forces  that  are  extensions,  through Nicaragua and Cuba, of the Soviet  Union.  The conjunction of these complaints can  mean, in effect, the extension of the Brezh  nev doctrine  in this hemisphere. That is,  communist attacks on a regime leech away  the regime's legitimacy, and produce pres sure for negotiations aimed at ""power-shar ing"" with Stalinists who do not believe in  sharing power. But a communist  regime,  however freshly planted and dependent on  foreign totalitarians, as in Nicaragua, must  be treated as legitimate and irreversible.  There is a war raging, and if all the sub stantial, determined military assistance  is  one-way, there can be but one result. The  result will be a communist Central America,  and an Iran  just a wade across  the Rio  Grande.e  THE  MARYLAND  COMMITTEE  FOR  CHILDREN  PROVIDES  CHILD  CARE  INFORMATION  AND REFERRAL  HON.

This legislation  provides Federal grant money to non profit groups wishing to provide assist ance to parents seeking child care. My  inspiration  for  this  legislation came  from the excellent work of the Mary land Committee for Children. Today,  the Maryland Committee for Children  officially opened Locate,  their child care information and referral system.  I congratulate them on this innovative  project.  The notable feature of Locate is its  use of computers to store the data on  child-care providers and to match up  parents' needs with providers' supply.  This system represents a partnership  of the new technology with the social  services. Locate will provide valuable  information about who  is providing  and who is using child care facilities in  Baltimore City and Anne Arundel and  Washington Counties. This is just the  kind of information legislators need.  I call the Baltimore Sun's article de scribing Locate to the attention of my  colleagues.

657,1377,7,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman  from North Carolina  <Mr.  NEAL) is recognized for 5 minutes.   ",1983
658,1377,7,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, supporters  of House Joint Resolution 13, which  calls for a mutual and verifiable freeze  in the development, production, and  deployment of nuclear weapons, and I  include myself among its supporters,  claim the freeze could bring a dramat ic halt to the nuclear arms race, with out jeopardizing our national security.  In a particularly cogent article pre pared  for  the Washington  Post,  former Director of the Central Intelli gence Agency, William Colby, agrees  with freeze proponents and declares  further  that it would end President  Reagan's policy of appeasement. It is  one of the best statements in support  of the freeze resolution that I have  seen and I urge my colleagues to read  it.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post]  REAGAN SHOULD TuRN FRoM ""APPEASEMENT""  TO A FREEzE  (By William E. Colby)  To use language meaningful to those of  President Reagan's generation  <and my  own), appeasement doesn't work. I am sure  the president would agree with that state ment, but in fact, he is engaged in a pro gram of appeasement. NATO's first resolute  decision to deploy 108 Pershing II missiles  and 464 cruise missiles to meet the Soviet  8820 buildup has been  followed by  the  president's proposal of a  zero option on  both sides, rejected by the Soviets, and then  a suggestion for an interim solution, also re jected by the Soviets.  The president's proposal to supplant the  SALT II treaty by the START proposal to  reduce strategic launchers to 850 on each  side and warheads to 5,000, no more than  half of which would be land-based, has been  rejected by the Soviets. The U.S.S.R. made  a minimal move in our direction by suggest ing an 1,800-launcher limit. The administra tion now considers means by which it could  move off its original proposal  toward the  Soviet position.  Another appeasement being attempted is  of the anti-nuclear and nuclear freeze move ments in the West. The political force of  these movements led the administration to  soften its previous positions, in hopes of di luting the impatience of millions of Europe ans and Americans over their governments'  inability  to  reduce  the nuclear  terror  to  which they are exposed. Minor variations of  the degree of terror certainly are not going  to appease  these movements, particularly  when these gestures are matched by plans  to bring in new weapons systems like the  MX, the 05, the B1, and a whole new di mension of space warfare.  The real requirement is for a bold move to  halt the arms race, as a clear indication of  resolution to reduce the nuclear terror to  which all our populations are subjected.  This is the basis for the call for a mutual  and verifiable freeze on the testing, produc tion and deployment of nuclear weapons  and their delivery systems. A recitation of  what this freeze will produce in benefits to  the safety of the United States is a compel ling argument for Regan to leapfrog the ob structionists who urge his to oppose it and  instead take leadership of it.  A simple projection of current weapons  plans that would be obviated by a  freeze  demonstrates its value to the safety of our  country:  (1 > A freeze on new types of land-based  missiles permitted under SALT  II would  halt the present Soviet testing of two new  types. It would also halt the MX. The prime  characteristic of these new weapons is an in crease in accuracy and consequent targeting  of  the  land-based missile systems of  the  other side. While the so-called ""first-strike""  scenario is discussed as a theoretical possi bility today, the advent of these new weap ons systems will bring it remarkably closer.  Both sides will be convinced that the other  will soon have the potential for a single dev astating blow, requiring that it keep itself  on hair-trigger alert for an equally devastat ing response. The decision time in such cir cumstances will be reduced so that automat ic, not human, decisions will have to be pro grammed, offering the sickening prospect of  mutual destruction through machine error.  (2) A freeze would bar the development of  cruise missile armadas on both sides. While  the United States is technologically ahead  with this new device to date, it is predictable  that the Soviets will develop their own capa bility within the next decade. They did just  that with respect to the MIRV, after it was  left out of SALT  I  in 1972 because  the  United States had no incentive to bar itself  from something the Soviets did not then  have. At the end of this decade, we can con fidently expect a national debate over the  need  for  a  comprehensive  air  defense  system to protect the United States from a  Soviet cruise missile armada. This whole de velopment would be eliminated by a freeze  today.  (3) A freeze would bar the further devel opment and deployment of the Blackjack  bomber on the Soviet side and of the Bl on  the American side. This would have to be  clarified in the discussions  leading to the  freeze agreement, but it seems clear that  the strategic arms negotiating history con siders intercontinental aircraft to be launch ers rather than platforms. Again, this would  prevent the buildup of a large Soviet inter continental nuclear air force requiring the  kind of air defense system the Soviets are  now hoping can hold off at least some of  our B52s.  (4) The freeze would bar the development  of the D5 missile by the United States, with  its improvements in accuracy leading to the  danger of first strike from the sea. Similar ly, it would bar a more accurate Soviet sub marine-launched missile. It would not bar  the replacement of Polaris submarines by  Tridents because  the negotiating history  has  considered  submarines  as  platforms  rather than as launchers. The Soviets are  currently considerably behind  the United  States in submarine technology, but again it  can be confidently expected that they will  improve over the next decades through a  combination of espionage, allocation of re sources and talent, and plain competitive de termination. A freeze on launchers would  limit the application of those improvements  in the nuclear dimension.  Each of the arguments against the freeze  collapses under careful examination:  (1) The Soviets are certainly not ""superi or"" to the United States in any meaningful  way today. If they were, we would see them  using that superiority, rather than indicat ing concern over the technological superior ity of the United States and its ability to  leap ahead  in  technology  in  the coming  years at a pace beyond that possible for the  Soviet Union. The present American retalia tion potential is absolute, and with a modi cum of maintenance,  its components will  not vanish from old age.  The Soviets  restrict  their  adventurism  these days to the safer techniques of proxy  war, subversion and attempts to encourage  weakness of American will and separation  from European opinion. This is not the blus ter of someone convinced that he has the  power  to dominate.  It is  the wiliness of  someone operating from a position of weak ness,  trying  to  slow  the opponent down  without direct confrontation.  (2) Could we verify whether the Soviets  would abide by such an agreement? The ad ministration's own reports show that we are  doing exactly that in our attention to poten tial violations of SALT II and the steady  buildup of Soviet power. The fact is that  our intelligence system will cover the Soviet  Union's nuclear weaponry whether there is  a freeze between us or not; a freeze treaty  would merely make it easier to do so be cause of the numerous elements included in  recent  treaties  to  facilitate  the process.  Even in areas of ambiguity, of which there  will certainly be some, such as the current  indications of Soviet violation of the chemi cal and biological treaty, it is plain that our  intelligence systems have picked up these  activities. They have not occurred without  being exposed to outside scrutiny.  The fact that the Soviets might violate a  treaty  is  not  the determinant. No  one  should ""trust"" them not to do so. The real  point is whether we would catch them at it  and be able to act upon that information.  The evidence  today  indicates  that this  is  clearly the case. Any violation that would be  extensive enough to have an impact on the  strategic balance would certainly be noticed  by us.  The real question is what we proposed to  do about a violation rather than whether we  would know of it. In this respect, there are  improvements that can be made in proce dures, such as third-party investigations and  decisions, interim sanctions and greater visi bility upon challenge. The Soviets have  shown themselves in recent treaties to be  willing to yield some of their long-held pho bias against exposure of their affairs, pro vided that the result is specifically in their  interest.  (3) A freeze would certainly be of advan tage to the Soviet Union, halting the major  American nuclear buildup now planned. As  with any successful  treaty, however,  the  question is whether it would be in the equal  interest of the United States, halting a cer tain further Soviet buildup of nuclear weap onry, which, or course,  it would.

668,4,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  the  WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION  ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE  CASUALTIES  IN  A  NUCLEAR  WAR  ",1983
669,4,13,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on  Tuesday of this week I reported to the  Senate  the World Health Organiza tion's  findings  on  the  enormous  number of casualties we could expect  in a nuclear war, that is the number of  persons who would be killed and those  who would be injured. Today I report  to  the Senate on how  the World  Health  Organization  suggests  we  might, with our available medical re sources, try to cope with the surviving  victims, the injured,  in the event of  such a catastrophe.  The first tragic fact to recognize is  , that the devastation of hospital facili , ties, the death of doctors, nurses and  1 other medical personnel and the immense number of  seriously  injured  would mean that the vast majority of  the injured could receive no medical  attention at all.  The two sole instances when nuclear  bombs were  dropped  on  populated  cities-Hiroshima and Nagasaki-offer  the most practical examples of the dif ficulties. In Hiroshima all the hospi tals within a kilometer of the hypo centre were totally destroyed and vir tually everyone within them killed or  injured; 93 percent of the nurses and  91 percent of the doctors were killed  or injured. In Nagasaki the university  hospital, which contained over 75 per cent of the hospital beds and medical  facilities in the city, was destroyed and  80 percent of its occupants killed or in jured.  The World Health Organization also  points to a study by U.S. Arms Control  Agency in 1979 that took Boston as an  example. What they found provides a  real eye opener for what a nuclear war  would do to our medical care facilities,  and how literally naked of any medical  protection we would find ourselves in  the event of a nuclear catastrophe.  This study found  that a 1 megaton  bomb burst over Boston would cause  about 700,000  immediate deaths and  similar number of  injuries. That  is  about half the population would be  killed or injured by that single bomb.  If 50 percent of the 5,200 physicians in  Boston survived to treat the 700,000  injured, it would take physicians more  than 4 days working for 16 P-ours a  day and devoting 15 minutes to each  patient. Boston has some 13,000 hospi tal beds but they are  in the urban  target area and 38 of the 48 acute care  hospitals would be destroyed or badly  damaged  so only  about 2,000  beds  would be left for the injured. As the  WHO found in their report:  The whole  infrastructure  required  for  dealing with  serious  injuries-operating  rooms,  nurses,  blood,  antibiotics,  water supplies, electricity, telephones, heat ing, transport services would be in disarray.  Surviving health workers would find it diffi cult to make their way to hospitals through  streets endangered by  radioactive  fallout  and obstructed by  fires and  rubble, and  rescue workers would have similar difficul ties in reaching and transporting victims.  drugs,  The WHO report concludes: In this  kind of nuclear disaster, ""the capacity  of the surviving medical personnel to  provide adequate care or even merely  to provide first aid and keep the vic tims alive, would be next to nil.''  Mr. President,  this  is  a  terrible,  morbid heart breaking  story. Who  wants to hear it? None of us. But as  U.S. Senators we have a duty to think  about and in fact to dwell on this grim  prospect, and we have an even grim mer responsibility to bring these grue some facts to the American people so  all of us will recognize how imperative  is our prime duty to push, and push  hard, for an end to the arms race.  Mr.  REMEMBERING ""TERRmLE JUNE  DAYS""  PROXMIRE. Mr.  President,  June 15 marked the 43d anniversary of  the ""Terrible June Days"" when  the  Soviet Union invaded and occupied the  Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania.  My distinguished colleague from Ne braska <Mr. ZoRINSKY) recently spoke  of this tragedy. The goal of the Soviet  Union was the physical annihilation of  these distinct  cultures. Over 30,000  Lithuanians were deported or liquidat ed during a 4-day period in 1940. Be tween 1941 and 1951, approximately  700,000 Lithuanians faced such brutal  treatment. The Soviet Union sought to  extinguish all vestiges of Lithuanian  tradition merely because  they were  different.  Evidence clearly shows  that  these  acts were planned approximately 2  years before the first major tragedy  occurred.  Such heinous events, however, are  not limited to the history books. Re ports of senseless torture, killings, and  atrocities have  recently  come  from  every part of the world. According to a  recent United Nations  report,  there  ",1983
670,17,13,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President,  I  would like to associate myself with the  remarks of  the subcommittee chair man.  The  bill  includes  $1,475,986,000,  which is an increase of only $9 million  over the current year and a reduction  of $19 million below the amounts in cluded in the President's budget for  the  legislative branch. The  increase  overall is less than 1 percent over the  current year which reflects the efforts  of the subcommittee to hold down the  expenses of the legislative branch.  Mr. President, I am not aware of any  controversy involving any of the provisions in this bill. I urge my colleagues  to adopt this measure.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr.  President,  I  would now like to make a motion to fa cilitate the consideration of this bill.  Because  the Congress has not yet  adopted  the first concurrent resolu tion on the budget for fiscal year 1984,  I move, in accordance with section 904  of the Congressional Budget Act,  to  waive the provisions of section 303 of   ",1983
671,43,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I sup port the conference report and I com mend  the chairman of  the Budget  Committee and the conferees.  I  believe  that  the  central  issue  before us is the need to reduce deficits  in order  to  insure  lasting economic  growth and jobs. This budget resolu tion does reduce deficits; it does assure  financial markets that there is a will  in this Congress to reduce the huge  demand of Government debt on pri vate capital markets. It assures that as  the expansion continues, there will be  adequate funds at reasonable interest  rate to fuel continued growth.  Furthermore this resolution calls for  lower  deficits  than  the President's  budget as revised in April would have  entailed. The resolution envisages a 3year total deficit of $471.2 billion; the  President's  revised  budget  deficit  would total $513 billion over the same  period.  Now there are some who claim that  this resolution is deficient because it  achieves deficit reduction through rev enue  increases  rather  than  through  spending cuts. In fact the resolution  calls for less spending than does the  President's budget  request. As  the  chairman has pointed out, the confer ence resolution provides total outlays  of $2.719 trillion over the next 3 fiscal  years,  but  the  President's  request  called  for $2.724  trillion-$5 billion  higher  than  the  conference  agree ment.  I am constrained to point out that  relying  on  spending  cuts  alone  to  reduce deficits is futile. The votes do  not exist in this or the other body to  implement  this strategy. The Hatch  substitute  to  the budget  resolution  won only 23 votes, Hollings substitute  only 16. To argue that the correct way  to reduce deficits is through draconian  spending cuts that simply cannot be  enacted is,  in my view sophistry. To  borrow a phrase, it is voodoo budget  policy.  I regret that the effort to pass this  budget has been so difficult. I believe  that the President has an important  stake  in strengthening  the congres sional budget process. His own pro gram of spending cuts and tax cuts  could not have been enacted in 1981  without the reconciliation procedures  provided by the budget process.  ",1983

673,69,13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased  to  join Senators RIEGLE and  PELL in sponsoring the ""School Facili ties Child Care Act of 1983.""  On June 9, Senator SPECTER and I  convened the first policy forum of the  Children's Caucus. That  forum  fo cused on  the problems  confronting  latchkey children or those youngsters  who must care for  themselves after  school.  At that forum, we learned that be tween 6 and 15 million American chil dren could be home by themselves be tween the hours of 3 in the afternoon  and 6 or 7 in the evening. Such chil dren may face four serious risks. They  may be injured accidentally or victim ized. They may become less willing to  tackle school assignments because no  one is home to help them. They may  end up feeling lonely or bored. And,  they may act badly, vandalizing neigh borhood property.  We must provide latchkey children  with  alternatives  to  staying  home  alone if we are to protect them from  such risks. Afterschool programs pro vide alternatives.  At the June 9 forum, we heard from  two afterschool programs. The first,  Park Elementary  in Anne Arundel,  Md., is funded under a 2-year action  grant. After that 2 years, their fund ing runs out. The second, the Hearst  afterschool program  in Washington,  D.C., is funded entirely by tuition paid  by parents. The director of the Hearst  program spoke at  length about  the  numbers of parents in the District of  Columbia who cannot afford  to pay  tuition for afterschool care.  This legislation would allow HHS to  make grants to both private and public  services in public schools_ As such, it  recognizes  that the Federal Govern ment should play a role in fostering  partnerships between public  schools  and communities. Such partnerships  will help us solve the latchkey prob lem.  I urge my colleagues to join with me  in sponsoring this legislation to help  meet the pressing need for afterschool  care in this country    ",1983
674,69,13,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be a cosponsor of this important  legislation  to safeguard our  Nation's most  precious  natural  re source-our children.  The economic pressure of our times,  rigid workplace  schedules,  the phe nomenon of both parents working out side  the home, and  the  increase  in  single parent families have produced  millions of latchkey children in our so ciety. These are school age youngsters  who  return  to  empty homes  after  school closes. They let themselves in  the house, turn on the television and  wait for their parents to return home  from work. Often they must remain  indoors  because  their  parents  are  afraid  to allow  them  to go outside.  Alone and unsupervised, often for sev eral hours, these children represent a  national scandal and a national  re sponsibility.  Our society has changed. While it is  pleasant  to  recall  the  ideal of  the  past-the village green full of children  at play, mother at home with cookies  and milk-that is simply not the reali ty for the overwhelming majority of  American  families. The fact  is  that  over half of the mothers of school age  children work outside the home. Six  million children come home not  to  milk and cookies, but an empty home.  These children are our responsibil ity. Their parents do not have the in dividual resources to provide care for  them. We must provide  the support  for development of afterschool pro grams to meet this need.  Psychology Today  reports  that  in  State College, Pa., the American Asso ciation of Unversity Women funded a  program known as Phone Friend. Vol unteers cover a phone bank to provide  a point of contact for children home  alone after school. The children call  because they need assistance, advice,  reassurance, and help with homework.  Phone Friend  is a  laudable effort,  but it is no substitute for afterschool  care and supervision. It is a sad com mentary on our society when 7 year  olds must use a telephone when they  need comforting or help with home work.  This legislation will begin to provide  much needed programs for afterschool  care. Public and private agencies will  receive grants to develop and adminis ter after school care programs for chil dren ages 6-13.  The parents of Brookline, Mass.,  have developed a model program for  before  school and  afterschool child  care.  Brookline  afterschool  special  program <BASS)  provides  a  trained  staff to supervise youngsters 8 to 12  years old. Transportation  from  the  eight schools served is provided by the  program.  For a fee within the reach of even  single parents a child can enjoy super vised play, homework, and the tradi tional milk and cookies.  Mr. President,  I would  like  to see  programs like this in every community. The school age child care bill will  support and encourage  the develop ment of programs like BASS. I  look  forward to the enactment of this im portant legislation.  By Mr. GARN (for himself, Mr.  HEINZ, Mr. PROXMIRE, and Mr.  DODD) (by request>:  S. 1532.

ACQUISITION OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS   ",1983
675,69,13,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I am in troducing,  by  request of Chairman  Volcker  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Board, a bill to  impose a  temporary  moratorium, until December 31, 1983,  on  the  establishment  of  nonbank  banks and on the scope of nondeposi tory activities engaged in by banking  and thrift organizations.  Since last year, the Federal Reserve  has been concerned that the skillful  use of  the banking statutes has en abled many new banking organizations  to avoid being subject to the regula tory framework and Federal Reserve  supervisory authority contained in the  Bank Holding Company Act.  As indicated by Chairman Volcker's  transmittal letter, the purpose of the  moratorium is to provide time for Con gress to consider legislation designed  to ""address the fundamental need to  adapt  the  banking  and  financial  system to a rapidly changing world.""  In sum, participants in the financial  marketplace are continuing to pursue  aggressive  and  innovative  business  strategies which reflect technological  and  other  contemporary  advance ments which were not even known or  imagined when such  laws were en acted.  I agree wholeheartedly with Chair man Volcker that Congress must ad dress  the  changes  in  the  financial  system. How to insure such congres sional attention is, in my opinion, un clear. The best way  is  to meet  the  issues head on, but some,  including  Chairman Volcker, believe that a mor atorium is necessary to make certain  that the world does not change com pletely before Congress acts. However,  moratoriums also run the risk of being  open-ended delays, much like regula tion Q and the interest rate differen tial. To his credit, Chairman Volcker  has developed a proposal with a short  time limit and urges Congress to con sider more substantive  legislation  in  the interim.  As another part of this process,  I  expect that next week the Treasury  Department will submit their updated  version of last year's nonbanking ac tivities legislation. When I receive it, I  anticipate introducing this legislation  ",1983

I will be very brief, since I have so  little time left.  Mr. Speaker, this bill has a  totally  political and partisan origin.

To call it tax equity on the floor of  the House of Representatives is totally  incredible.  I want to urge my colleagues to vote  against the previous question. To talk  about equity in the Rules Committee  the gentleman  from Oklahoma had  his amendment made in order but the  Rules Committee refused to make in  order the amendment by the gentle man  from Minnesota, which would  have imposed a spending cap, instead  of  the  tax  increase we  are  talking  about.

699,121,13,Mr. SHANNON.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  I seek this time to clarify something  that was said earlier. The gentleman  from Texas was  indicating that two earner  families  in  the  $30,000  to  $40,000  range would be experiencing  large tax increases under this proposal  when, in fact, I would point out to the  gentleman that only 2 percent of the  thank the gen taxpayers  described,  the  two-earner  family, $30,000 to $40,000, only 2 per cent of them would be affected at all  by this cap. They would be affected to  the tune of $43 a year or an average of  80 cents a week.  We are going to hear a lot of facts  later in the day, a lot of misstatements  of fact about what this cap does. But  let us make a few things clear.  Only 10 percent of the taxpayers in  the  country  are  affected  by  this.  Eighty-nine percent of the burden of  increased taxes will rest on people who  earn over $50,000,  and  the  tax  in creases,  the very small tax increases  that fall on people under $50,000 will  fall on a  very  small percentage of  people who earn under $50,000.

One-half of all of the jobs in Amer ica are provided by small business; 70  percent of  the new  jobs come from  small business.

Tax increases  cannot produce  lower  interest rates.  Additional taxes crowd productive dol",1983
727,160,13,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Speaker,  the  choice we face today in voting on the  conference report on the first budget  resolution for fiscal 1984  is  really a  very simple one: Do we do the respon sible thing by voting for a budget out line to give ourselves and the country  a clear signal as to what our actions in  the next year are to be, or do we, by  defeating this resolution, commit our selves to a year of economic chaos by  closing our eyes to the hard choices  that have to be made, and just pretend  that if we ignore them, all our prob lems will go away?  For my part, I intend to choose the  first option. I am under no illusions  that the budget we have before us is a  perfect piece of budgetary planning.  Any document  that is  the result of  good  faith  bipartisan  compromise  seldom pleases anyone in all its parts.  For instance, I am still disturbed by  the inordinately high deficits that this  budget produces. Similarly, I am dis turbed by the fact that little attention  is paid to the rising costs of entitle ment programs. We  as  a Congress  must act, and must act soon, to revise  the system under which COLA's in  these programs are determined, and I  am disappointed that this resolution  does not begin that process. Finally, I  am less than satisfied by the inclusion  in this resolution of the so-called re serve fund. Frankly, to my mind, this  inclusion merely muddies the issue of  what the true deficit picture in this  resolution is. The one saving grace in  this situation is  that if these funds,  some $8.5 billion, are not used for spe cific  recovery and growth programs,  they cannot be used for any other pur pose, and thus would be available for  deficit reduction. I intend to examine  very closely any programs that are to  be funded under this reserve fund. At  this point in time, I would have to say  very frankly that I would prefer to use  these funds for deficit reduction pur poses, rather than new spending pro grams.  All that having been said, however,  there remain some very good reasons  to support this resolution. First, defi cits are significantly reduced both in  fiscal 1984 and in future years. Com pared to present policies now in place,  passage of this resolution will result in  deficit  reductions, excluding possible  Reserve funded programs, of $16.9 bil lion in fiscal 1984 alone. In the years  from 1984 through 1986, these deficit  reductions will  total  $124.4  billion.  This is no small saving. While the defi cits planned for here are still too high,  they represent a significant improve ment over present policy.  Second,  the  resolution provides  a  real  5-percent  increase  in  defense  spending. There is no one in this Con gress who believes more firmly  in a  strong national defense than I do, but  the  incredibly wasteful proposals of  the administration to double the size  of  this  large  increase with wish  list  philosophies of weapons procurement  are simply not acceptable. We learned  a  very hard  lesson  in  this country  when we destroyed the national con sensus for social programs by waste fully throwing money at them without  a careful examination of our priorities  and real needs. The administration's  present position on defense spending  threatens to similarly destroy the na tional consensus  for  a  stronger de fense, and I will play no part in such a  destruction.  Third, the House and Senate confer ees have agreed, in this resolution, on  a 3-year total tax increase of $73 bil lion to reduce long-term deficits when  the recovery is well established. This  may be the most controversial element  of the resolution, and I am sure it will  be the object of a great deal of distor tion. However, if we look at the facts  of the situation, something fairly sur prising  comes  to  light. Under  the  President's  proposals,  revenue  in creases in 1986 will result in a  total  picture of revenues as a percentage of  gross national product of 20.2 percent.  Under the resolution,  revenues as a  percentage of GNP in 1986 will be only  19.9 percent. In other words, the reso lution before us actually represents a  decrease  in taxation from  the Presi dent's  proposals.  In  effect,  then,  anyone voting against this resolution,  and supporting the President's propos als, is calling for an increase of taxes  as a percentage of GNP.  Fourth, the reconciliation language  of this resolution calls for deficit re ductions of $85.3 billion over the next  3 years. Reconciliation will take place  only if a budget is passed. In the plain est possible terms, failure to enact a  budget  this year will  result  in  in creased deficits of $85.3 billion over  the next 3 years. The abandonment of  the budget process will open the flood gates of overspending, without a sensi ble rein on the spending proclivities of  both the administration and the Con gress.  Finally, we have been told that the  administration  does  not  care  if  a  budget passes. In fact, it would almost  prefer that it does not. This is a very  curious position to take for an admin istration  which  keeps  proclaiming  loudly, to anyone who will listen, that  it is a staunch advocate of fiscal re sponsibility. An  editorial  from  the  June 22, 1983, issue of the Washington  Post summarizes  this situation very  well. In that editorial, which I ask per mission to insert into the RECORD at  the conclusion of my  remarks,  the  statement is made that the President  ""apparently sees more political advan tage  in disrupting congressional  at tempts to curb the deficit than in pro viding the leadership for a reasonable  compromise."" That is a strong charge,  and I sincerely hope that it is not, in  fact,  true. The budgetary process of  this Government is too important to  be made  into  a  political  football,  where political advantage, rather than  the national good, is the primary moti vation.  This  resolution,  as  I  have  said  before, is not perfect. It is the result of  a compromise between men of good  will who, although they may have dif fering political parties, and contrast ing philosophies, have come together  in a spirit of compromise and concilia tion to provide a reasoned, moderate  budgetary  pattern  for  the  coming  fiscal year. To  reject  the results of  their labor is to reject a plan that will  reduce deficits, provide meaningful in creases in defense spending and, in the  long  run,  reduce  the percentage of  taxes that we ask our citizens to pay.  To reject all of these things in favor of  cheap political grandstanding  is be neath the dignity of this Congress.  I urge my colleagues to do the re sponsibile thing, and vote for this reso lution. At this point I include the fol lowing editorial:  [From the Washington Post, June 22, 19831  BUDGET PROGRESS  As  ""Somewhat of  a miracle."" That's how  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete  Domenici described the accor!f reached by  budget conferees on Monday night. Perhaps  that's  an  exaggeration,  but miraculous  things can happen when hardworking legis lators sit down in a spirit of comity to work  out their differences.  they  JllOVe  the  budget  resolution  toward passage by the full Congress, con gressional leaders will still have to overcome  the  same  obstacle  that  has  impeded  progress thus far. That obstacle is the presi dent, who apparently sees more political ad vantage  in  disrupting  congressional  at tempts to curb the deficit than in providing  the leadership for a reasonable compromise.  Congress has every  reason  to  feel  ag grieved by  the president's behavior, since  the poor choices that it faces-the need to  cut spending, raise taxes and still face enor mous deficits-are so much the administra tion's doing. Nor does the president's cur rent position make much substantive sense.  For example, on taxes, the resolution calls  for $12 billion more in revenues next year  than the president's budget. The president  says those taxes will hurt the recovery. But  it is inconceivable that a $12 billion tax in crease will have any negative effect on a $3  trillion economy already  fueled by  three  years of massive deficit spending. It might,  however, have the beneficial result of calm ing the interest rate, which is already show ing renewed signs of anxiety over the pros pect of uncontrolled future deficits. As for  the tax increases proposed for subsequent  years, in opposing them the president is es sentially contradicting his own budget-or  giving further plausibility to the notion that  his ""standby"" taxes were only window dress ing to diminish the gargantuan deficits that  would otherwise have been evident.  For  the military,  the  resolution would  boost annual spending authority to $268.6  billion, an  increase of $24 billion. Actual  purchases next year would rise still faster  because of  the huge backlog of weapons  ",1983

732,173,13,Mr. SHANNON.," Mr. Chairman, if I  may reclaim my time, I stood on the  floor of the House of Representatives  2 years ago when the gentleman from  New York got into a colloquy with the  gentleman  from Georgia <Mr. LEvi TAS). The gentleman  from Georgia  said at that  time, ""I am concerned  about this third year of the tax cut be cause I am concerned that the third  year of the tax cut is going to result in  huge deficits.""

733,173,13,Mr. KEMP., We have not had the  third year yet.  ,1983
734,173,13,Mr. SHANNON.," And the gentleman  from New York got up and said, ""Well,  I think we need a multiyear tax cut,  and I hope you will go along with it;  and  I want  to assure you  that this  President would not undertake any  policy that would leave this country in  an economic decline over the next 3 or  4 years.""  What I want to say to the gentle man, the author of that policy, is that  that policy has resulted in economic  decline.  ",1983
735,173,13,Mr. KEMP.," Well, I would disagree.  Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman  yield?  ",1983
736,173,13,Mr. SHANNON.," If I may be permit ted to finish my statement, let me just  say this:  I have seen all these Members come  down into the well and talk about how  they are really trying to protect the  poor and the middle class. The move  that they make today would put the  Flying Wallendas  to shame when  it  comes to stretching a point about how  concerned they are about the poor and  the middle class.  But what I cannot get over is that  while they talk about the poor and the  middle class, their policies always ben efit the rich.  We do not want to vote for any tax  increase bill, but we are realistic and  we are not going to put our heads in  the sand. We are not going to let these  deficits continue; we are not going to  let higher interest rates choke off an  economic recovery; we are not going to  deny the chance for millions of Ameri cans to go back to work by being fis cally irresponsible.  There are political costs in that, I  understand, but I ask the Members on  the other side of the aisle to rise above  their own rhetoric. I ask them to rise  above their own history and try to do  something that is fair. Their policies  have sapped from our economy  two  things  that  the Democratic Party  seeks to restore beginning today. They  have sapped fairness and  they have  sapped growth, and we are going  to  begin on the road back to growth and  fairness beginning today.  ",1983
737,173,13,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS).  ",1983
738,173,13,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in opposition to this betrayal of  the American taxpayers. Let there be  no mistake-this proposed cap on the  July 1 tax cut is a working couples' tax  increase. And at a time when the econ omy  is making,  sure,  but  fragile,  progress toward recovery, the country  can ill afford to take more money out  of the wallets of working Americans  and  to undermine  the  incentives  to  work and save which the President's  tax relief plan has created.  Claims that this third year tax cut  benefits only  the wealthy are pure  nonsense. Almost half of those affect ed by  this cap have  incomes under  $50,000. It is also interesting to note  that a recent Gallup poll showed that  55 percent of all  respondents  favor  putting  the  tax cut  into  effect  as  scheduled  and,  interestingly,  that  among respondents with incomes be tween $15,000 and $25,000, 64 percent  support the tax cut. It is the middle  class who will be hurt by this cap, just  as  it has been the middle class who  has had to bear the brunt of so many  failures by Congress to see beyond the  political expediency of spend, spend,  spend budget policies that necessitate  tax increases.  As a small businessman and member  of the Small Business Committee,  I  am  particularly  distressed  that we  would consider a measure which would  make it more difficult for this impor tant sector of the economy  to grow  and  prosper. Eighty-six  percent  of  small businesses pay taxes under indi vidual  rather  than  corporate  tax  schedules and this means that nearly  2.5 million small businesses will see  their taxes increased if this $700 cap is  approved. Does  this say  to  the Na tion's small businessmen and business women-the backbone of our economy  and, I believe,  the key to recovery that we want them to suceed? No. It  just makes it harder for them to do so.  The problem is not the willingness  of  the American  taxpayers  to pay  their fair share, but the willingness of  the American Congress to make tough  choices. I submit that we will never see  complete  recovery until we have  a  Congress with the discipline  to stop  spending taxpayers' money as if it was  their own and the wisdom to stop pe nalizing initiative, hard work, and suc cess as if they were national embar rassments rather than tremendous national resources, of which I, for one,  am very proud.  Our constituents cannot afford any  more taxes. Let us stand up for their  rights and vote this irresponsible in crease down.  ",1983
739,173,13,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield such time as he may consume to  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  <Mr.  PORTER).  ",1983
740,173,13,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to this misguided and in equitable bill.  Mr. Chairman, every year this body  passes commemorative  legislation  to  designate days, weeks, years, in recog nition of outstanding achievements of  one group or another. Mr. Chairman, I  think this year should be designated  ""Congressional Irresponsibility Year.""  This will show the American people  that we in the Congress recognize the  fact that despite the Reagan adminis tration's valiant attempt  to foster a  strong and lasting economic recovery,  the House Democratic leadership has  done all it can to derail the President's  train of tax relief measures begun in  1981.  Thankfully,  they have  failed. But  they are now so desperate  to keep  their hands in the taxpayer's pockets,  they are resorting to shaking down the  little guy. Let's look at the facts. The  House's first concurrent budget resolu tion called for repeal of the July 1 tax  cut and income tax indexing. Failing  that, our friends on the other side of  the aisle now propose another plan  which would cheat the middle class  out of their portion of the Kemp-Roth  tax reduction by capping the July 1  tax reduction at $700. Although I real ize it is difficult for some to break old  habits,  it is  time  to teach these old  dogs new tricks.  Inflation-induced bracket creep,  in creased  social  security,  and  State  taxes, and  the August 1982 Federal  tax increase have joined to effectively  wipe out the first 15 percent of the  1981  tax reduction plan. On July 1,  the lower-and middle-income families  in the Nation will, for the first time,  reap  the  benefits  of  a  10-percent  across-the-board  reductions  in  their  marginal tax rates. Top bracket tax payers will not receive any relief from  the third year of the tax cut on their  income above $55,300 for singles and  $109,400 for joint filers. Clearly this is  a tax reduction that is well timed to  coincide with  the recovery and well  placed  to  give  those who  need  it  most-the  lowerand middle-bracket  taxpayers-an opportunity to increase  their disposable income.  Capping  the  tax cut at $700 does  little to provide ""tax equity"" between  lower and higher income brackets as  this bill purports. The cap  increases  the marginal  rates  in  the middle  brackets but would not increase the  50-percent rate that the affluent pay.  ",1983

742,186,13,Mr. ROWLAND.," Mr. Chairman, I do  not believe that we are going to reach  any agreement today on whether or  not H.R. 1183  raises  taxes or  limits  cuts, but I believe we are all in agree ment on the need to reduce the budget  deficit.  I rise in support of the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Okla homa to link the level of the third year tax cuts with the ability of the  Congress  to reduce spending by  the  same amount.  .  I  certainly do not support  taking  money out of the pockets of the Amer ican  taxpayer  to use  for  increased  Government spending, but neither do  I  support  offering  exorbitant  tax  breaks when we are facing a $200 bil lion deficit.  When the 3-year tax reductions were  proposed in 1981, the assumption was  that the economy would improve, the  budget would be balanced, and  the  Government could afford to give the  taxpayers some relief.  We have seen our deficit go  from  $57.9 billion at the beginning of this  administration, and two tax cuts later,  it is approaching $200 billion.  There  is simply no  logic  in giving  taxpayers a few more dollars to spend  in a sick economy, when the Govern ment's efforts to cover the deficit are  keeping interest rates artificially high.  There has also been no evidence to  indicate  that  the  tax  reductions of  1982 have  resulted  in any  increased  spending or saving by those who bene fited.  Most of  those  individuals  in  the  $50,000 to $100,000 income bracket will  not experience significant changes in  their lifestyles with the additional 10percent tax cut.  The point is, however, that we must  be equitable in the distribution of the  burden of financing our Government.  Although many here say that to cap  the tax cut will mainly affect those  taxpayers under $50,000.  Perhaps  this  is  true,  in  absolute  numbers of people-for a rather obvi ous reason. The majority of the popu lation falls into this category.  But the fact remains that 89 percent  of the revenue generated by the cap  will . come  from  those making over  $50,000.  Are these the middle-income Ameri cans we are trying to protect? If demo graphics are of any importance in this  discussion, and  I  think  they are,  I  would like to point out that in my dis trict, less than 3 percent of the popu lation earn more than $50,000, and the  average income is around $16,000.  Approximately 88 percent of my dis trict will not be affected in any way by  the most  liberal estimates. This 88percent figure  is quite generous, be cause the assumptions upon which it  is based are that all of my constituents  are single, have no dependents, and do  not itemize on their tax returns.  In talking with the people of the  eighth district, I have been told time  and  time again  that  individuals are  willing to forgo the third year tax cut  completely, but only if the additional  revenue is applied toward the deficit.  This  legislation does not seek  the  repeal of the tax cut, but a fair com promise that the American people can  live with, if the deficit is reduced by  the same $6.2 billion that will be gen erated.  But  I  am  still concerned  that a  faulty perception exists that Congress  is voting to increase the taxes of every  working American, and this is just not  true.  If there  is a  smokescreen  to hide  behind in this issue, it is one of pro tecting the wealthy of this country to  the detriment of the middle-and-lower  income people.  Now is the time, if the Members of  this body are sincere in their commit ment to lower the deficit, to vote for  the McCurdy amendment and for final  passage of H.R. 1183.  These actions  are  indicative of a  desire to do more than pay lipservice  to reducing the budget deficit. I urge  my colleagues to take this opportunity  to show their true concern over our  Nation's overall economic health.  ",1983
743,186,13,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Chair man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle man from California <Mr. LEHMAN).  of California. Mr.  Chairman, during his campaign  for  the Presidency, Ronald Reagan pre sented himself  as  a magician who  would do the impossible for the Ameri can people. Mr. Reagan pledged  to  Mr. LEHMAN  ",1983
744,199,13,Mr. WRIGHT.," Mr. Chairman, there  are two very good reasons why this bill  ought to be passed today. The first is  that it reduced the deficit by $6.8 bil lion in the coming today. The second  is that it restores a semblance of fair ness to the tortured Tax Code through  which revenues have been drained by  the Reagan tax policies as through a  leaky sieve into the pockets of the fa vored few of this country.  Mr. Reagan preaches piously about  deficits; but the fact of the matter is  that his tax cuts for the wealthy, the  biggest  in history, have created  the  biggest deficits in history. The Presi dent's own budget  office  estimates  that his 1981  tax cut, most of it for  the most affluent, will cost the govern ment $609 billion by 1986.  In other  words, it will add $609 billion to the  deficits.  According to Secretary Regan in tes timony given before our Budget Com mittee, that tax cut of 1981 will drain  $135 billion away from the Treasury  this fiscal year and add $135 billion to  the deficit that now reaches $210 bil lion this fiscal year. It is the Reagan  deficit.  The Joint Committee on Taxation  reports that 35 percent of this enor mous loss will flow directly into the  pockets of the wealthiest 5 percent of  America's citizens, those who need the  tax cut the least.  This  bill would  not  recover  one  penny of the windfall that has already  gone to the fortunate few. It simply  places a  reasonable  limit upon  the  future drain of the Government's re sources into their already-swollen pri vate bank accounts.  It has been stated  repeatedly by  people on  the Republican side  that  this bill will not get a penny from the  biggest income Americans, and that a  $1 million taxpayer would get off scot  free. Well,  that  is  not what Alice  Rivlin says.  CLAUDE PEPPER, hearing that charge,  wrote a  letter today and asked Mrs.  Rivlin, Director of the Congressional  Budget Office,  exactly what would  happen to a $1 million income taxpay er as a result of this cap. I have her  reply  in my hand. She  said,  ""Mr.  Chairman, in response to your ques tion, a taxpayer with a million dollars  of income, filing a  joint return with  two dependents would have his tax cut  reduced by $3,736  if  the cap  is  im posed.""  In  other words,  he would  have  gotten an additional tax cut of $4,400  absent this bill; now he is going to get  a tax cut of $700 additional this year  instead if this bill is enacted.  Mr. Reagan came to office promising  a balanced budget by 1984. Do you re member that? Well, precisely because  he got his way in 1981 and 1982 and at  least partly because of his favored tax  treatment for the wealthiest few, the  Reagan deficit in 1983 will be $210 bil lion. That is more  than three times  higher than the highest deficit ever  suffered under any previous adminis tration.  If Jimmy Carter had presided over a  $210 billion deficit, there would have  been cries for his impeachment.  This huge deficit is the result of the  policy of spend and spend, borrow and  borrow, and pay and pay in tax wind falls to the wealthy few.  In 1980, Ronald Reagan blamed all  of our economic woes upon the Carter  deficit. Do you remember that? Well,  that deficit was about $57 billion. And  now, having personally engineered a  deficit in 1 year which exceeds all of  the deficits of the total 4 years of the  Carter  administration, Mr. Reagan  threatens to veto any bill that would  reduce his enormous deficit by $6 or  $7 billion.  Today, Mr. Reagan is speaking of his  new-found  concern  for  the middle income and the low-income taxpayers.  But his words have a hollow ring. It is  just exactly  like his new-found con cern  for public education, after his  personal efforts in the last 3 years to  rob public education of billions of dol lars of its needed funding.  0 1800  His  deeds  speak  louder  than his  words. Let us show you just how con cerned Mr.  Reagan  is  about  the  middle-income taxpayer. Last August  he asked over televison for increased  taxes on that middle-income  taxpay er's telephone bill, on his airline fare,  on his gallon on gasoline, and on the  medical bills that are paid by the indi gent. And now he wants an extra  standby surtax on the tax that this  middle-income  taxpayer  pays.  All  those  taxes are paid by middleand  low-income taxpayers. But Mr. Reagan  threatens to veto any bill that puts  any ceiling at all on  the additional  windfall tax cuts for the wealthiest 5  percent. That is  the measure of his  concern.  The Reagan administration has set  in motion the most retrogressive redis tribution of wealth in America's histo ry. From the pockets of the poorest  into the coffers of the richest.  In 4  years,  the Reagan  tax and  budget changes will  take $20 billion  away from households with incomes of  $10,000 and less and they will add $64  billion to the after-tax income of those  making $80,000 a year and more.  Mr. Reagan may consider people in  the $80,000 a year income moderate or low-income taxpayers. The average  taxpayer does not consider them such.  Mr. Reagan, himself, is reported to  have saved $90,000 on his taxes last  year because of the 1981 act.  Well,  in this bill  today, we  finally  say, ""Enough."" I do not think it is a  cheap shot to refer to the effects of  the 1981  tax cut upon those  in Mr.  Reagan's personal  income  range.  I  confess  to my colleagues personally  that it has meant money to me, it has  meant a  lower tax liability for me and probably for all of us here in this  Chamber today. But after all, let us  face it. Are we the average taxpayers,  are we typical of that average taxpay er for whom Mr. Reagan's heart pur portedly bleeds? Why, of course we are  not. We are not exactly typical of the  people who must  plow  their hard  earned money back into this economy  if we are to have a percolate-up action  that will start this economy moving  again. Those are the people who de serve a tax cut, the low and moderate  income  taxpayers, not the people at  the top of the economic pyramid.  So today, in passing this bill, we take  a first step away from the dangerous  precipice of  trickle-down  economics.  We make a modest beginning on defi cit reduction and we restore a modi cum of fairness to the badly ravaged  Code of Taxation. I ask you to join me  in taking that step today.  The CHAIRMAN. All time for gen eral debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill is con sidered  as  having  been  read  for  amendment under the 5-minute rule.

748,212,13,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to  apologize  to  the House  that  this  matter  is being brought up at  this  hour. I had asked the chairman of the  committee whether we could take this  up Tuesday morning, and appoint con ferees and go to conference then.  Believe me, there is nothing in this  bill that is urgent. Unfortunately, the  Chairman would rather bring it up to night; and that is the prerogative of  the majority.  I know how you  feel about being  here tonight, but how do you think I  feel?  I was supposed to receive the Man of  Vision Award from the Friends of Eye  Research this evening, and here I am  in the well.  But I do not want any of my col leagues to think that I brought this  late session about.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my  motion  to  instruct conferees on the  energy and water appropriations bill  to insist on the House position with  regard to the Garrison diversion unit  in North Dakota.  Mr. Speaker, as it passed the House  the energy and water bill contained no  funding for this project. As I noted in  my previous floor remarks,  this was  appropriate  in  light of  the House's  overwhelming vote last December to  eliminate funding for this project. The  Senate, however, has  included $22.3  million for this project.  Mr. Speaker,  I  am  offering  this  motion in order to place the House on  record once again in opposition to the  Garrison project. All of the problems  with this project that existed last De cember, when we voted 252 to 152 to  eliminate  the Garrison project  still  exist.  13. TVA EXEMPTION  The Senate bill provides that this act shall  apply  to  the Tennessee Valley Authority  only to the extent it deems practicable, con sistent with the purposes and conduct of its  programs and the policies of the Small Busi ness Act.  The House amendment contains no compa rable provision.  The  conference substitute provides  that  this Act shall apply to the TV A only with  respect to procurements to be paid from ap propriated funds.  While  the conference  report will apply  the provisions of this Act, as appropriate, to  the Tennessee Valley Authority only  for  those procurements derived from appropri ated funds made available to TV A, confer ees expect TV A to voluntarily comply with  the provisions of this Act to the greatest  extent possible for procurements to be paid  from power program funds, as well.  In a  manner consistent with the policies of the  Small Business Act and the TV A's responsi bility for  the operation of  its power pro grams, the conferees further expect TV A to  continue awarding a substantial portion of  its procurement contracts to small business,  regardless of the source of the procurement  funds, and  to  take appropriate additional  action, as necessary, to increase small busi ness  awareness  of,  and participation  in,  TV A's total procurement effort.  14. EFFECTIVE DATE  The Senate bill is effective as to procure ment actions initiated forty-five days after  the date of enactment.  The House amendment is effective upon  enactment.  The conference substitute makes the Act  applicable to procurement actions initiated  ninety days after  the date of enactment  except as to the restrictions on sole source  contracts which are effective October 1,  1983.

751,225,13,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the rule making in order  the consideration of H.R. 1398,  the  Energy Conservation Daylight Saving  Act of 1983, a bipartisan bill jointly co sponsored by me and my ranking mi nority member,  the gentleman from  California  (Mr. MOORHEAD). The bill  extends the period of daylight saving  time  beyond  the  present  6-month  period to 8 months, by starting day light saving time on the first Sunday  in March, instead of the last Sunday  in April.  Last Congress the House passed, by  a bipartisan vote of 243  to 165, H.R.  4437, which  is  identical  to  the bill  before us today. Unfortuntely, the leg islation was never taken to a vote in  the Senate.  During last Congress we learned of  many potential benefits of the legisla tion, the data for which was derived  from  experience  in  1974  and  1975  when the United States had extended  daylight saving time:  Energy savings of about 100,000 bar rels of oil equivalent per day during  the 2 extra months, according  to a  study conducted by the Department of  Transportation;  As many as 200 fewer traffic fatali ties per year, according to studies of  the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration;  A reduction in violent crimes of 10 to  13  percent, based upon a  study of  Washington, D.C., crime statistics by  the Law Enforcement Assistance Ad ministration of Washington, D.C.;  Increased recreational time, tourism,  and  extension  of  prime  shopping  hours; and  An extra period of sight and mobili ty for the hundreds of thousands of  Americans suffering from retinitis pig mentosa, a disease which causes night  blindness.  The legislation will make the period  of daylight saving  time symmetrical  around the summer solstice, the long est day of the year. As a  result, the  sunrises under this bill in March and  April will be no later than those cur rently experienced in September and  October.  The change in the period of daylight  saving  time  is  supported  by  the  Reagan administration, and previous  11-059 0-87-8 (Pt. 13)  administrations. Public opinion polls  also show a 2 to 1 public preference  for extended daylight saving time.  At a  recent subcommittee hearing,  testimony was heard from representa tives from the Department of Trans portation,  the Federal Communica tions Commission,  the Retinitis Pig mentosa Foundation,  the Southland  Corp., and the National Association of  Convenience Stores in support of the  legislation.  Enactment of  this  legislation  is a  simple step we can  take for energy  conservation, crime reduction, and the  economic recovery of our Nation.  ",1983

759,238,13,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, a  few  days ago on the floor of the House, I  denounced the Soviet Union's vicious  and officially orchestrated campaign  of anti-Semitism. The  latest step  in  this effort was  the creation of  the  Anti-Zionist Committee, which recent ly claimed that there are no Jews in  the Soviet Union who wish to emigrate  and charged Zionists with collaborat ing with the SS and Gestapo during  World War II.  Dr. William Korey, director of inter national  policy  research  at B'nai  B'rith International Council, has writ ten an analysis of  the new Jewish  policy of Soviet leader Yuriy Andro pov. Dr. Korey highlights the features  of that new policy beginning with the  background of  the creation of  the  Anti-Zionist Committee. He outlines  four features of the policy: First, an  end to emigration of Jews from the  Soviet Union; second, cutting ties be tween  the Soviet Jewish community  and Jews abroad;  third,  intensifying  forced cultural and linguistic assimila tion; and fourth anti-Zionist propagan da. This report has been copyrighted  and disseminated by the National Con ference on Soviet Jewry.  I  am  inserting  in  the RECORD  an  abridged version of Dr. Korey's analy sis:  ",1983
760,264,13,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing legislation today to reform  an excessively burdensome provision  of the medicare program.  As my colleagues know,  the basic  medicare hospital insurance program,  known  as part A,  is  automatically  available  to most  individuals when  they reach the age of 65. Those people  who during their working career-such  as teachers and other public employ ees-did not participate in social secu rity are not automatically eligible for  part A, but do have the opportunity to  purchase such coverage at a  rate of  $113 a month.  In addition, all medicare part A par ticipants have the opportunity to pur chase the supplementary medical  in surance, known as part B. This cover age now costs $12.20  a month and  covers physicians' and other services.  In each case,  the existing  law  re quires those eligible to purchase part  A or B coverage  to do so within 90  days of their 65th birthday. Anyone  purchasing part A or B coverage after  that  initial  enrollment  period  is  charged a penalty equal to 10 percent  for each year elapsed since the initial  enrollment period. Thus, individuals 1  year late in enrolling pay a 10-percent  penalty; those 2 years late pay a 20percent penalty, etcetera. This penal ty is paid each and every month of  coverage for the rest of the benefici ary's life.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  At the current rates, part A coverage  costs $113 a month. A 10-percent pen alty on top of this is $11.30, making  the  total monthly payment $124.30.  Medicare participants charged a penal ty are required under current law to  pay  that  penalty  each  and  every  month of coverage for the rest of their  lives.  These penalty fees can be a terrible  burden for seniors. To be sure,  the  Government has a legitimate need to  encourage prompt enrollment. With out such a penalty system, it would  only be natural for some individuals to  delay enrollment until the onset of a  major  illness. Such delays  in enroll ment would,  of  course,  deny  the  system significant revenues needed to  keep the system solvent.  On the other hand, in practice this  penalty-especially the part A compo nent-has  excessively  penalized  a  small  group  of  individuals. About  18,000 people nationwide-mostly  re tired public employees-purchase the  part A insurance, and only about 5,000  of them are paying some form of pen alty.  One group that I am aware of,  in  particular, are retired schoolteachers  in California, who believed  in good  faith that they had health insurance  from Blue Cross. That Blue Cross  policy was canceled, however, and by  the time the retired teachers learned  what had happened and understood  that they needed to sign up for medi care, many of them were assessed pen alties of from 1 to 3 years. Under cur rent law, these teachers will pay these  penalties for the rest of their lives.  My bill would keep the existing pen alty structure in place, with one signif icant change. Under my bill, the penal ty would be paid for twice the number  of years the enrollment was delayed  past the appropriate time, after which  the premium would revert to the regu lar monthly charge in affect at that  time.  Thus, someone 1 year late in enroll ing would pay a 10-percent penalty for  2 years; someone 2 years late would  pay a 20-percent penalty for 4 years,  and so on.  This legislation would apply to medi care  beneficiaries  currently  paying  part A or part B penalties. Such indi viduals would  receive  credit  toward  the total 6 years required for the time  they have already paid penalties. No  refunds, however, would be available.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is an  important  measure. For those who are forced to  pay it,  the penalty is a burdensome  and difficult requirement.  This is a moderate measure, which  attempts to maintain the basic prem ises  and  operation  of  the  penalty  system while at the same time elimi nating its most oppressive aspects.  I am pleased to have the support of  my colleague from California, Mr. PA NETTA, for this legislation, and urge its  June 23, 1983  careful and thoughtful consideration  by the Congress.  Thank you.e  CHRYSLER  CORP.  EXECUTIVE  SPEAKS  TO  CONGRESSIONAL  AUTOMOTIVE CAUCUS  HON. ELWOOD HILLIS  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 23, 1983   ",1983
761,264,13,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am plac ing in the record a  transcript of the  comments  Jerry  Greenwald,  vice  chairman of the Chrysler Corp. made  to  the  Congressional  Automotive  Caucus earlier this month. I strongly  recomment that my colleagues in the  House  read Mr. Greenwald's state ment. He offers an excellent insight  into some of the most important issues  facing the U.S. auto industry today.  JERRY GREENWALD SPEAKS ON AUTO  INDUSTRY SITUATION  Thank you all for coming this morning. I  think I understand very well now the advice  of a politician friend a few years ago when  he said, ""You have  to  remember  that if  you're going to come to speak in Washing ton, you have to learn how to speak and eat  at the same time."" I haven't learned that  trait as yet, and I think I'll just concentrate  on one of the two. I am both pleased and  privileged to be the first guest speaker of  the Automotive Caucus. I would like to do  everything I can both to offer our support  and to encourage you to make this caucus of  yours really become an important and for midable force in Washington. Others of its  type have worked very effectively and we  want to do everything we can to provide the  support that you would want of us.  A united front in Congress, when it comes  to the auto industry, can mean a great deal.  I can only emphasize to you what I suppose  you already know-that our industry, both  directly and indirectly, does represent em ployment for one out of six Americans in  our country. I'm not going to try to say to  you that what is good for the auto industry  is good for the Nation, but certainly some of  the remedies that will work for the auto in dustry will have the same impact for some  of the basic industry in the United States in  general. As we were discussing just a  few  minutes ago, I am happy to report that, for  now certainly, we see all the right signs that  Detroit is coming out of the doldrums. That  finally, having held our breath for 4 years,  the signs are up, car sales are up, employ ment  is beginning  to move. Some of our  plants are even working overtime.  I  think probably  the most  impressive  measure of the auto  industry's success  is  that Chrysler is making money. We, in the  first quarter of this year, in fact, we made  more money than any one quarter in more  than  54-55  years  of Chrysler's History.  That's still in an industry that is just begin ning to come out of recession. I think maybe  the best sign for you folks-I think I heard  a sigh of relief coming all the way from  Washington  into Detroit when we  an nounced that we are on the way to paying  off a full third of the loan guarantee pro gram. We're going to bring a great big check  on the 15th. We sort of tease some of the  ",1983
762,277,13,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to commend to my colleagues an  article in the current issue of the At lantic by Peter Rogers entitled ""The  Future of Water."" Many of us who  have worked on  the water  issue  in  Congress believe  that water quality  and  quantity  issues  constitute  the  most  important  resource  question  which we will  .face  in  the  coming  years. While Mr. Rogers outlines the  vastness of potential water problems  we are facing, he indicates wisely that  these problems are solvable  through  sound water management  policies.  Many of  these policies will have  to  originate here in Congress, though all  levels of government and the private  sector must be farsighted and coopera tive in dealing with the issue.  I commend the Peter Rogers' article  to my colleagues.  The article follows:  [From the Atlantic Monthly, July 19831  THE FuTURE OF WATER  <By Peter Rogers>  Is  there a  ""water crisis""  in the United  States? The impression has certainly been  created  in  recent years  that  there  soon  won't be enough water to go around, and  that much of what is left is likely to be poi soned. The 1982 report on the state of the  environment by The Conservation Founda tion, a nonprofit group devoted to the study  of environmental policy, describes how ex cessive consumption of surface water has  led to a reliance on groundwater, which has  itself been depleted, and also stressed by  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  contamination.  In 1981, Robert Harris, a  member of the Council on Environmental  Quality during the Carter Administration,  told a New York Times reporter that drink ing water  is ""a significant public health  hazard."" An ongoing study conducted by the  Environmental  Protection Agency  lends  some support  to Harris's charge. By  last  fall,  the EPA had found that the ground water supplies of 29 percent of the 954 cities  in its sample were contaminated, chiefly by  toxic wastes that had leached out of land fills.  A review of the popular press is a good  way to gauge the conventional view of most  questions. The cover of the June issue of  Science 81 showed a  rancher, a suburban  householder, a miner, and an Indian gath ered glumly around a water pump, with the  caption:  ""Rationing  the Colorado: Who  Gets the Last Drop?"" A quick look through  back copies of The New York Times yields  the following: the headline ""Efforts to Gain  'Fishable-Swimmable' Waters Appear  to  Falter"" <October 12, 1982); Representative  Robert Edgar, of Pennsylvania, arguing on  the op-ed page, ""Is America running out of  water? Yes .... "" <September 23, 1982>; the  headline ""Depletion of Underground Water  Formation Imperils Vast Farming Region""  <August 11, 1981>; and the headline ""Toxic  Chemicals Loom as Big Threat to the Na tion's Supply of Safe Water"" <August 13,  1981>.  Perhaps the most complete compendium  of these concerns to date is Fred Powledge's  recent book ""Water: The Nature, Uses, and  Future of Our Most Precious and Abused  Resource,"" which is devoted to a description  of what Powledge calls ""the water crisis.""  Powledge writes that ""the United States has  entered a period of grave emergency in its  supply of water,"" and that as far as con tamination is concerned, ""there is little indi cation  that anybody knows what  to do  about it."" He says, ""We are learning that  there is no escaping the poisons ... at least  with our current technology.""  Most of what one reads about the pollu tion of water in every region, and the short  supply in some parts of the country, is true.  It is not true, however, that nothing can be  done. Water's depletion and contamination  are not irreversible. We have the technology  and management skills to rise to the chal lenge; only the will to do so has been lack ing.  Unfortunately, for many people,  the re sponse to news of contamination and short age-or to the way in which the news is pre sented-is fear rather than determination.  The anxiety arises  in part from  the fact  that since the turn of the century we have  been able  to  take unlimited amounts of  clean water for granted. But as recently as  the end of the nineteenth century, the mor tality and morbidity rates from water-borne  diseases were  very  high.  <Because  they  remain high for the majority of the world's  population,  the United Nations has desig nated the 1980s the ""International Drinking  Water Supply and Sanitation Decade."") The  engineering achievements of the nineteenth  century and the early years of the twentieth  were,  in effect, too successful: as water in  short supply and of poor quality became a  distant memory, purity and plentifulness  began to be assumed rather than systemati cally safeguarded.  Although the results of our poor steward ship are not beyond repair, they should not  be minimized. Of these, contamination is by  far the most notorious. In 1974,  the Safe  Drinking Water Act, which Congress passed  17217  largely in response to the efforts of environ mentalist groups, forced many communities,  often for the first time, to search for chemi cal contaminants in their water supplies, as  well as for the traditionally monitored bio logical sources of pollution. People have  been quite surprised by  the exotic  toxic  chemicals  that were  found, and are still  being found. Disclosures of the reckless dis posal of  toxic wastes, which, by  leaching  into the earth, can contaminate groundwat er as well as soil, have not inspired confi dence in either government or industry, and  the addition of Times Beach, Missouri, to a  long roster of contaminated sites has led  many people to question the safety of their  own surroundings.  Some contaminants are showing up  in  water not because they have been recently  introduced but because scientists have only  recently become able  to measure them in  small concentrations. Moreover, the science  of assessing the amount of contaminants in  water is a good deal more precise than the  science of assessing the effects of contami nants on human health. Here we find that  definitive judgments are extremely difficult  to make. Although much work remains to  be done to improve these assessments, scien tists may never know more about the toxic  effects of many chemicals  than  they do  now. Too many variables <what statisticians  call ""noise"")-occupation, personal habits,  diet, the presence of environmental insults  other  than chemical  in question, and so  forth-exist in any given geographic area to  allow clear linkages of diseases to specific  contaminants. This frustration is not likely  to diminish significantly with time; it repre sents an inexorable deficit in scientific un derstanding.  The public has little tolerance for the am biguities that complicate statements about  contaminated water's  effects  on  health.  Confronted with the lack of sure knowledge,  many people assume that they are being  manipulated for devious reasons. Often, in  fact, the suspicion is well founded. Although  the uncertainties about toxicity ought to be  a warrant for extreme caution in any effort  to purify water, they have served also as a  refuge for manufacturers and the overseers  of landfills, who can cite the uncertainties  as a way of understanding  their  liability  once  contamination  is  discovered. Under  these circumstances, rational debate on how  best to protect water is hard to sustain.  Safeguarding water's quantity and quality  are two parts of a single enterprise-man agement-and most of the threats to water  in this country stem directly from the fact  that it is a common resource that has been  managed chiefly  in the service of private  profit. Believing that water is limitless, we  have made it available to industry and agri culture essentially at zero cost, and with few  stipulations. Therefore, we should not be  surprised or offended by the profligacy with  which  these users have exploited  it. Few  corporate officers who look to the bottom  line of a financial balance sheet would insist  on investing large sums to conserve or clean  up a resource for which their companies did  not have to pay much in the first place.  To worsen the consequences of this funda mental  error,  the country's shortsighted  and  rudimentary control of  the environ ment makes it inevitable that the regulators  will trail behind those regulated. Even as we  restrict the permissible levels of some con taminants we discover others, and must set  regulations on  those as well,  in a never ending game of catch-up. Similarly, as we  undertake  large  and  costly  engineering  ",1983
763,290,13,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, I  am  introducing  legislation  today  to  modify  the  targeted  jobs tax credit.  The purpose of this legislation is to  help  troubled teenagers become pro ductive, law-abiding citizens.  Under current law, youths aged 18 to  25 who are from economically disad vantaged families can be certified for  the credit. Under my bill, youths aged  16 to 18 from disadvantaged families  could also be certified  if  they have  been  charged with  a  delinquent,  unruly, or  incorrigible act and have  been referred to a court as a result.  The certification would be sought by  the court in order to help these young sters find  jobs and straighten them selves out.  Mr. Speaker, this House has demon strated its commitment to efforts to  help the youth of today find meaning ful, productive jobs. Another bill for  that purpose which I sponsored, the  American Conservation Corps, was  passed overwhelmingly by the House  earlier this year. I urge similar speedy  action on this important legislation.   SOVIET JAMMING OF THE VOA  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 23, 1983  e ",1983
764,290,13,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  let me share with you an interesting  article which recently appeared in the  Washington Times  newspaper  con cerning  the Soviet Union.  I  believe  that my colleagues in the House will  find the following article quite inform ative concerning the Soviets' true atti tudes regarding the free flow of infor mation and news.  In spite of the Soviets' efforts to try  to convince the world that they truly  believe in freedom and open access to  information,  they  show  their  true  colors when they selectively jam trans missions beamed  toward Poland and  the Soviet Union which may be even  slightly critical of the Soviet Union or  its foreign policy objectives.  Last year, during the Polish crisis,  the Soviets began intensive  jamming  of VOA Polish-language broadcasts di rected at Poland. Just last week, as the  article notes, the Soviets again began  jamming the VOA's coverage of the  Pope's appearances in his homeland.  The VOA is providing live coverage of  the Pope's activities in Poland and is  also  rebroadcasting  the  pontiff's  speeches.  June 23, 1983  The Soviets are using large transmit ters located in the U.S.S.R. to drown  out  the VOA  signals with a heavy  ""buzz saw"" jamming noise on the four  frequencies being used by the VOA. It  is hard to believe that in an age of ad vanced  technology,  greater  under standing among  the peoples of  the  world, and open information exchange  that the Kremlin would resort to such  offensive and primitive techniques.  Lest we forget, the Soviets are signa tories to the Helsinki accords of 1975  which specifically state that all ""par ticipating states make it their aim to  facilitate  freer and wider dissemina tion of information of all kinds."" In  addition, the Soviets signed the 1973  International Communication Conven tion which  specifically  forbids  jam ming of radio broadcasts coming from  other nations. Jamming also violates  the terms of the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights. I believe that this  says a lot about the Soviets' real feel ings concerning signed  international  agreements.  I am confident that all of my friends  in the House will agree that resorting  to jamming is a  renewed demonstra tion of the glaring weaknesses of the  Soviets' own system and of the regime  they have imposed on Poland. Why do  they fear the truth?  Let me suggest an answer. I believe  that millions  of  oppressed  people  living  in  the many captive nations  around the world desperately want to  hear the truth about what is going on  in the world and in their own coun tries. The truth will let them see that  their own governments have been se lectively  controlling  the  news  and  blocking out information which they  believe  the masses should not hear.  The truth will reveal to the masses in  the captive nations of the world the  real sham of many of these regimes  which maintain power through coer cion,  intimidation, and thought con trol.  Let me then take this opportunity to  share the sad truth about communism  with all of you. In that spirit, I strong ly recommend the Washington Times  article to all of the Members of the  House.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Times, June 23,  19831  SOVIETS JAM VOA ON POPE  , <By George Archibald)  Soviet  jamming  of Voice  of America  broadcasts of Pope John Paul II's visit to  Poland is ""odious, patronizing and in fla grant  disregard  of  international  agree ments,"" VOA Director Kenneth Tomlinson  charged yesterday.  The Soviets have beamed noise interfer ence  to block radio reception  throughout  Poland of three hours of additional daily  VOA coverage of  the pope's appearances  since the pontiff arrived in his communist dominated homeland last week, Tomlinson  reported.

765,316,13,Mr.  COLEMAN  of  Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3190,  the Extra Long Staple Cotton Act of  1983. Extra long staple <ELS> cotton,  primarily grown domestically in three  States, including my district in west  Texas,  is known as the ""Cadillac of  Cotton."" This is because ELS is a spe cialty fiber used mostly in the manu facture of high-quality knitted prod ucts as well as sewing thread. Produc tion of the specialty fiber compared  with that of the more common upland  cotton  is on a much smaller scale U.S.  production  last  year  of ELS  cotton was 99,000 bales compared with  an upland figure of 11.9 million bales.  This bill would go a long way to af fording those farmers who grow ELS  cotton a greater degree of flexibility in  making their planting decisions and in  their ability to be competitive in both  the domestic and export markets. At  the same time that quotas and acreage  allotments  are  eliminated  for ELS  cotton, a mechanism is set in place to  guard against overproduction and de pressed prices.  Some of the key provisions of this  legislation  that should be noted  in clude:  The minimum price support loan for  ELS cotton would be 50 percent above  the rate established for upland cotton;  A target price program would be cre ated for ELS cotton, with the target  set each year at 20 percent above the  price support loan rate;  Existing legal authority for acreage  allotments would be terminated; and  Should the Secretary of Agriculture  determine that ELS suppliers were in  danger of becoming excessive, he could  require compliance with an acreage re duction program as a  condition  for  price support loans and  target price  protection.  Mr. Speaker,  this legislation repre sents the hard work of many diverse  interests  in  the ELS cotton growers  community, the textile industry, and  the USDA.  It  is  legislation  that  is  aimed at a  specific commodity and  that seeks to address the special needs  of those who must grow this precious  crop.  I am extremely pleased  to be  able to vote for this constructive legis lation that helps a vital constituency  not only within my district of west  Texas, but also throughout a tristate  area  in  the  Southwestern United  States.e  ",1983

780,394,13,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, let me  answer the question this way. I have  said on the floor previously, and will  repeat now, that nothing in this agree ment in any way precludes the oppor tunity of  the Senator  from North  Carolina to offer another amendment  on  this  subject,  including  the  star  print of S. 26. But I cannot say to the  Senator when  that will be done.  I  could simply say that I will not make  any effort to avoid it happening and,  indeed,  I  fully  expect  that  it will  happen.  Now, whether  it happens  as  an  amendment or whether it happens as  a freestanding measure I suppose is a  matter that we still must discuss. But  there is nothing in this proposal that  would in any way circumscribe the op portunity of the Senator from North  Carolina  to exercise his  full  rights,  which I will jealously protect, to offer  that proposal as an amendment  to  some other measure or as a freestand ing bill.  ",1983
781,394,13,Mr. HELMS., But the Senator is re ferring  to a  later  time on another  piece of legislation-not the pending  Senate Joint Resolution 3?  ,1983

783,394,13,Mr. HELMS., Because this proposed  unanimous  consent  stipulates  no  amendments would be  in order on  Senate Joint Resolution 3.  ,1983
784,394,13,Mr. BAKER.," Yes; not to this bill.  Mr. President, I am referring to some  future time. It would not be in order  under this agreement at this time.  ",1983
785,394,13,Mr. HELMS.," The majority  leader  does  understand  that  the Senator  from North Carolina does not want to  tie up the Senate unnecessarily in con sideration of  the  legislation  remedy  which he feels would better address  the right-to-life question. There was  some misunderstanding last year and I  do not want a recurrence of that. The  unanimous-consent request propound ed  by  the  distinguished majority  leader would leave the Senator from  North Carolina no option except  to  offer  the  language of S.  26  as an  amendment to another piece of legisla tion later on.  I want to emphasize again that I will  be willing to enter into a time agree ment on my proposal, whenever  it  occurs, whether it is on the measure  now  pending  or  some  subsequent  measure. But the point is, Mr. Presi dent-and I make this observation as  courteously and agreeably as I know  how-that we have a very good chance  of a majority vote on  the proposal  that I intend to offer later on.  Now, the Senator from Oregon can  count votes, and so can I. He knows,  and I know, that there are not nearly  enough votes to approve the pending  constitutional proposal. And I under stand the Senator's strategy in con senting to this debate on the Hatch Eagleton proposal.  I do want  to say  to  the majority  leader that I shall not object to this  unanimous-consent request, but I do  want him to understand, and I want  my  fellow Senators  to  understand,  that it will not be my desire to tie up  the Senate with respect to this issue at  some future time. If the Senate is tied  up, it will not be my doing. I will be  willing  to enter  into whatever  time  agreement  Senator  PACKWOOD  and  Senators who  support his point of  view are willing to make with the ma jority leader. If they are unwilling to  limit the debate, it will confirm my as sessment that there very well could be  a majority in favor of the language of  star print S. 26.  ",1983

792,420,13,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President,  I  did not enter this colloquy earlier. I  know Senator SYMMS  is waiting  to  make a speech, as am I. But I do have  a question.  I was struck by one comment Sena tor PACKWOOD made, which was that  one  thing Congress did not like was  the  particular  moral  conclusion  reached by the Supreme Court. I am  curious  to know when  the Supreme  Court got into the business of making  moral conclusions?  ",1983
793,420,13,Mr. PACKWOOD., There are those  who disagree with their decisions who  say they make moral conclusions all  the time. There are those who agree  with them who call them legal deci sions.  ,1983
794,420,13,Mr. DANFORTH.," I hope we can all  agree  that,  insofar as  the Supreme  Court purports to decide constitution al issues, those decisions are based on  a reading of the Constitution and they  should not reflect a moral conclusion  on the part of the Court.  ",1983
795,420,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," I was reflecting,  when I used the word ""moral,"" the ar gument of the critics that they made a  moral rather than a  legal decision. I  find the decision legal.  The main point I was making is that  the objection  to  this decision  is not  that, for the first  time in 160 years,  they entered into this area. They did  that in Miranda, they did in Gideon,  they did in apportionment.  ",1983
796,420,13,Mr. DANFORTH.,"  is  clear  that  there are many, many people in the  United States who are against abor tion and many people  in the United  States who, as reflected by their elect ed  representatives  in State  legisla tures, would pass  laws against abor tion. I take it the argument before us  right  now  is  not  an  argument on  whether or not we are for or against  abortion; rather, it is a question as to  what is encompassed within the ConIt  stitution and what should be encom passed within the Constitution,  inso far as there is an alleged right to an  abortion created by the Constitution,  the  establishment  of  such  a  right  moving  the matter  outside  of  the  realm of  the State  legislatures and  outside of the realm of whatever the  people or their elected representatives  happen to think about the matter.  ",1983
797,420,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," That is correct.  All I am saying is that for those who  want  to overturn  the decision,  they  should not use the argument that the  Supreme Court has done something  unique in its history. It has not. They  have  reversed  themselves  in  other  cases. They have found new law that  they did not find before. I think it is  an unwise precedent to say that this is  the only time the Court has ever done  it and  therefore, and only  for  that  reason, it should be reversed.  ",1983
798,420,13,Mr. HATCH.,"  If the Senator will  yield, that is not what we are saying.  Maybe we can allow these two Sena tors to express themselves, but I would  like to ask the Senator this question in  advance,  then we shall chat about it  later.  He has suggested that the amend ment  is  a  non-States-rights  amend ment. I would like to ask him to share  with me an area of law that he does  believe to be the subject of the con cept of States rights. We can discuss  this further later.  I yield at  this  time  to  the distin guished Senator from Idaho and then  after the distinguished Senator from  Idaho I yield to the distinguished Sen ator from Missouri.  ",1983
799,420,13,Mr.  SYMMS.,"  I  thank  the  disti guished Senator from Utah. I rise in  support of his amendment, would like  to address a few elements of this im portant issue.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to revise and extend my remarks  and to insert at the end of my remarks  a page of footnotes to material that I  will mention.  ",1983
800,420,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  <See exhibit 1.)  ",1983
801,420,13,Mr.  SYMMS.," Mr.  President,  the  recent Supreme Court decisions on  abortion  have  demonstrated  once  again  just how extreme  the Court's  position  on  abortion  really  is. We  should all by now be aware of  the  facts  that the Federal  judiciary has  imposed  a  policy  of  abortion-on demand  for  the entire 9 months of  pregnancy. The only other country  with such a permissive national policy  is Communist China.  The courts have prohibited any leg islative response to some things that I  really think we can all agree need to  be addressed.  Late-term abortions  result  in hun dreds, perhaps thousands, of children  who are born alive but dying from the  trauma of the abortion. Girls as young  as 14 or 15 are required to have access  to abortion even when their parents  are convinced that abortion is not in  their daughter's best interests. Courts  have ordered nonvoluntary abortion  for mentally retarded women. Some of  these women have died as the result of  their abortions. And now we are told,  in the latest Court decree, that States  cannot even require that women be in formed of the medical risks of abor tion, or of the stage of development of  the fetus they wish to abort.  In effect, the courts have substitut ed their judgment for the judgment of  legislatures, of parents and now even  of the women who seek abortion with out sufficient information to make an  informed choice.  One of the most troublesome, and  indeed horrifying, consequences of the  judicially imposed abortion ""right""  is  the growing practice of sex-selective  abortion. More and more parents are  utilizing prenatal tests to discover the  sex of their unborn child, and aborting  that child when it is found to be the  ""wrong"" sex.  If this seems rather farfetched  to  my fellow Senators, I would ask them  to consider  this: Prenatal  testing  is  readily  becoming  standard medical  practice-not only for women thought  to be at  increased risk of bearing a  handicapped child, but for any woman  who seems concerned about her preg nancy. More alarming is the fact that  many physicians and geneticists are  perfectly willing to assist patients in  their efforts to identify and abort chil dren of the unwanted sex. The prevail ing policy is to give the parents this in formation if they wish to have it. At  New York Hospital, for example, re quests for amniocentesis solely for sex  determination are fairly frequent. And  at least one specialist in amniocentesis  there admits that there is no way to  prevent patients from using such in formation  to abort the ""wrong"" sex.  Nor can any legislature fashion a law  to prevent this practice so long as the  Supreme Court's right to abortion is  allowed to stand.  In a special report on  the ethical,  social,  and  legal  issues  surrounding  prenatal diagnosis,  the Genetics Re search Group of the Hastings Center  argued that there should be no legal  interference with parental choice  in  the area of sex-selective abortion. The  report stated that abortion performed  because the child is the wrong sex can  appear justifiable to some parents and  should be respected.  The head of  the genetics unit at  George Washington University Hospi tal has said that he has no hestitation  about helping parents choose the sex  of their children via abortion-he says  that he just does not recognize any ab soluted here.  Perhaps Tabitha Powledge of  the  Hastings Center summed  it up best:  ",1983
802,459,13,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the subject under discussion today abortion-is a topic which makes most  of us distinctly uneasy. In fact,  the  very mention of  the word causes a  great many people to be uneasy. For  many  thoughtful persons,  the pros pect of antiabortion legislation arouses  powerful feelings of the most personal  nature-fear, dread, sometimes anger.  Many women are nearly terrified by  the prospect of being required to con tinue a pregnancy against their will.  They feel very personally threatened  by  legislation which would deny or  limit  their  now  legally  established  right to abortion and feel that it is an  invasion of their personal privacy and  an intolerable threat to their personal  freedom.  Many  sympathetic  men  share this perception. This reaction is  completely  understandable,  in my  judgment.  At the same time, many other per sons  contemplate with  horror  the  abortions which they see as taking the  lives of millions of innocent and de fenseless unborn children.  I deeply regret that this issue must  come before Congress. From a purely  personal standpoint, I am reluctant to  assume the responsibility of attempt ing to weigh and choose between two  such  fundamental  rights-personal  privacy, which Justice Brandeis once  characterized as the right most cher ished  by  civilized persons-and  the  sanctity of life, certainly one of the  most ingrained-perhaps the most in grained-of all human values.  The task of making such a decision  is  forced upon Congress by  the Su preme Court's decision in the case of  Roe against Wade. As a result of that  case, more  than 15 million  legalized  abortions  have  been  performed  in  recent years and it is estimated that a  million more are occurring each year.  In some areas,  there are now more  abortions than live births. Thus, Con gress must either act to restrain this  trend or, by failing to do so, acquiesce  in a national policy of abortion-on demand.  Swirling around the abortion contro versy are many complex ethical and  legal arguments, but it seems  to me  there is one central issue on which all  else depends:  Is  the  fetus within a  pregnant woman a living baby human  being. Or is it not?  Few, if any, of those who believe the  fetus is a baby would object to some  degree  of  legal  protection  for  the  unborn child. While recognizing  the  very strong presumption against inter fering with the privacy and right of  personal choice of individual women,  few persons who acknowledge that the  fetus  is  a  baby would  nonetheless  object to some form or degree of legal  protection for the unborn child. If, as  advocates of antiabortion  legislation  contend, a fetus is a human being, it is  very hard to dispute  the claim that  the unborn child  is entitled  to  the  same human  compassion  and  legal  protection  afforded  other  human  beings, particularly helpless and de pendent humans.  Prochoice  advocates  oppose  anti abortion  legislation because of  their  concern for the freedom of choice of  the woman and, in most instances, pre cisely because they deny the humanity  of the fetus which they view as prehu man or as having human potential.  They do not agree that a fetus  is a  true human being in the normal sense  and,  therefore,  they deny  that  the  fetus, or unborn child, as prolife per sons prefer to say, is entitled to either  the compassion or legal protection ac corded to true human beings.  To  a  large  extent,  the Supreme  Court sidestepped this issue when it  struck down State antiabortion stat utes in the case of Roe against Wade.  In that decision, the Court ruled that  the 14th amendment right of personal  privacy precludes the State from inter fering with a woman's right to termi nate pregnancy through abortion. The  Court indicated that a fetus is not a  ""person"" within the meaning of the  14th amendment and is, therefore, not  entitled to constitutional protections.  Significantly, however, the Court did  not attempt to determine the human ity of  the fetus nor to define when  human life begins. The Court charac terized this issue as ""sensitive and dif ficult"" and noted ""wide divergence of  thinking"" on this question and that  the judiciary ""is not in a position to  speculate as to the answer.""  But for individual persons who must  decide  the moral  permissibility  of  abortion and for the Congress, faced  with a momentous policy  issue,  this  fundamental  question may  not  be  avoided.  The  exact  instant  at which  life  begins  remains  the subject of some  disagreement.  Not  everyone would  agree with Prof. Hymie Gordon, chair man of  the Department of Medical  Genetics  at  the Mayo Clinic who  stated: ""The question of when human  life begins is an established fact. All  life,  including human  life, begins at  the moment of conception."" However,  it does appear that the great prepon derance of evidence, as well as expert  testimony and opinion, support Pro fessor Gordon's view.  Dr. Francis A. Schaeffer, a  leading  philosopher and theologian, and Dr. C.  Everett Koop, U.S. Surgeon General  and well-known author in the field of  medical ethics, have persuasively sum marized  the  life-begins-at-conception  argument:  THE GROWTH OF HUMAN LIFE  Our reasons against abortion are logical as  well as moral. It is impossible for anyone to  say when a developing fetus becomes viable,  that is, has the ability to exist on its own.  Smaller and smaller premature infants are  being saved each year! There was a day  when a 1000-gram preemie had no chance,  now 50  percent of preemies under 1000  grams are being saved. Theoretically, there  once was a point beyond which technology  could not be expected to go in salvaging pre mature infants-but with further technolog ical advances, who knows what the limits  may be! The eventual possibilities are stag gering.  The logical approach is to go back to the  sperm and the egg. A sperm has  twenty three chromosomes; even though it is alive  and can fertilize an egg, it can never make  another sperm. An egg also has  twenty three chromosomes, and it can never make  another egg. Thus, we  have  sperm  that  cannot reproduce and eggs that cannot re produce unless they get together. Once the  union of a sperm and an egg occurs and the  twenty-three  chromosomes  of  each  are  brought  together  into one cell  that has  forty-six chromosomes, that one cell has all  the DNA Cthe whole genetic code) that will,  if not interrupted, make a human being.  Our question to a pro-abortion doctor who  would not kill  a  newborn baby  is  this:  ""Would you then kill this infant a minute  before he was born, or a minute before that,  or a minute before that, or a minute before  that?"" At what point in time can one consid er life to be worthless and the next minute  precious and worth saving?  Having already mentioned the union of  sperm and egg  to give  forty-six chromo somes, let us briefly review the development  of a baby. At twenty-one days, the first ir regular beats occur in the developing heart,  long before the mother is sure she is preg nant. Forty-five days after conception, elec troencephalographic waves can be picked up  from the baby's developing brain.  By the ninth and tenth weeks, the thyroid  and the adrenal glands are functioning. The  baby can squint,  swallow, and move his  tongue. The  sex  hormones  are  already  present. By twelve or thirteen weeks, he has  fingernails; he sucks his  thumb and will  recoil from pain. His fingerprints, on the  hands which  have  already  formed, will  never  change  throughout  his  lifetime  except for size. Legally, it is understood that  an individual's fingerprints distinguish him  as a separate identity and are the most diffi cult characteristic to falsify.  In the fourth month the growing baby is  eight to ten inches long. The fifth month is  a  time of  lengthening and strengthening.  Skin, hair, and nails grow. Sweat glands  come into being; oil glands excrete. This is  the month in which the mother feels the in fant's movements.  In the sixth month the developing baby  responds to light and sound. He can sleep  and awaken. He gets hiccups and can hear  the beat of his mother's heart. Survival out side the womb is now possible. In the sev enth month  the nervous system becomes  much more complex. The infant is about  sixteen inches long and weighs about three  pounds. The eighth and ninth months see a  fattening of the baby.  We do not know how anyone who has seen  the remarkable films of the intrauterine de velopment of the human embryo can still  maintain that the product of an abortion  consists of just some membranes or a part  ",1983

808,524,13,Mr. WEICKER.," Mr. President, today  I am very pleased to recommend to my  colleagues passage of S. 1341, Educa tion of the Handicapped Act Amend ments of 1983.  This  legislation  is  the result of 2  days of hearings held earlier this year  by the Subcommittee on the Handi capped. Throughout  these  hearings  the necessity of maintaining and im proving special education support and  demonstration activities was fully es tablished and I am pleased to report,  Mr. President, that S. 1341 was report ed unanimously by both the Subcom mittee and the Labor and Human Re sources Committee.  In addition to extending the life of  these  discretionary  programs  for  3  years,  the amendments expand  the  range of children served, both in terms  of age and  type of disability. Provi sions are made for intervention begin ning at birth under the preschool and  early childhood programs, while post secondary programs are broadened to  include all disabilities.  A new demonstration activity deal ing with the critical  transition from  school to employment has been estab lished and the need to train parents to  participate in their children's special  education has been emphasized.  Federal data collection and evalua tion responsibilities are strengthened  and provisions  for  reporting  to  the  Congress are  improved. Overall  au thorizations have been increased to ac count  for  inflation both  for  special  education and the special institutions  such as Gallaudet College and the Na tional  Technical  Institute  for  the  Deaf.  More than 4 million disabled young sters are receiving services under our  Nation's special education  law. The  law focuses on these youngsters' abili ties and seeks to develop them fully.  The  education of  the handicapped  amendments will continue these serv ices,  improve them and at the same  time give new opportunities for us to  learn how these services can be fur ther strengthened.  I ask, Mr. President, that the techni cal amendments to S. 1341 be accepted  with the bill as well as an amendment  requested by Senator EAGLETON clari fying the existing passthrough provi sions of the act.  I urge my colleagues to support S.  1341.  ",1983
809,524,13,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I  re quest permission to consider S. 1341, a  bill to extend and revise the Education  of  the Handicapped Act <EHA>. Al though this bill deals only with sec5.3  1984  tion 618 and 619 of part B and discre tionary programs, they are essential in  guaranteeing  that  a  comprehensive  range of services are available for all  handicapped  children. By  targeting  areas  that warrant special consider ation,  these  discretionary  programs  complement the other provisions con tained within Public Law 94-142, the  Education for All Handicapped Chil drens Act and allows successful imple mentation of the statute.  S. 1341 as approved by my Labor and  Human Resources Committee extends  the authorization for Federal activities  relating to the evaluation component  of part B,  the  incentive program of  part B and the discretionary programs  of parts C, D, E, and F which includes  regional resource centers, centers and  services for the deaf-blind, early child hood  programs,  and  postsecondary  education program, training of person nel and parents, recruitment and in formation, and instructional services.  The authorization level for fiscal year  have  been  raised  percent  above the 1981 reconciliation ceiling to  allow for increased child count while  other programs have been adjusted for  inflation and other factors. For the  other 2 years, authorization ceilings  have been adjusted for inflation.  This legislation has recognizable bi partison support as evident by the fact  that it was unanimously approved by  both the Subcommittee on the Handi capped and my full committee. In ad dition, I remind by colleagues that a  vote in the affirmative for S. 1341 is a  vote for providing services to 4 million  handicapped children of our Nation.  At this  time, I would  like  to com mend Senator WEICKER for his efforts  in initiating this legislation. His fine  leadership deserves our recognition. I  now yield the floor  to my colleague  from Connecticut.  ",1983

Since the enactment of this landmark  bill  in 1975 millions of handicapped  school-aged children and youth have  gained access to a free and appropriate  public education. The Federal man date  that  this  legislation  represents  has helped school districts around the  country  to provide vital services  to  children who were previously denied  them.

811,550,13,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, as a  member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, I was recently heartened  to learn that, even though we are not  now in the midst of an energy crisis,  some college campuses are seriously  and systematically trying to conserve.  Twelve  colleges  and  universities  around the country, including Lincoln  Land Community College  in Spring field, Ill., are participating in a demon stration energy management and  nancing program that is expected to  cut their exorbitant energy costs by up  to  25  percent.  Sponsored  by  the  Higher Education Energy Task Force,  the program will be  transferred  o  other campuses nationwide at the end  of the development period next year.  In recent years higher education's  energy and other costs have soared. As  a result, tuition is so high that many  bright students simply cannot afford  to attend college. Conserving energy is  one important way campuses can keep  down their costs.  Printed  in  the March 25 Chicago  Tribune, the following article by Chris  Crittenden,  director  of  the Energy  Task Force, tells more about the need  and  opportunity  for  colleges  to  embark on a course of conservation.  [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 25, 1983]  EDUCATION'S HIGH COST OF ENERGY  <By Christopher E. Crittenden>  Our nation's 3,250 colleges and universi ties are in trouble financially. Their energy  costs rose from $700,000 in 1974 to $3.2 bilJune 27, 1983  lion  last year, an increase of 457 percent.  Despite the temporary oil glut, their energy  bill this year is expected to be upwards of  $3.5  billion. Compounding higher  educa tion's financial problems have been  infla tion and the recent drastic cuts in Federal  aid.  When our campuses  suffer  financially,  students also suffer. The $3.2 billion they  spent on energy last year would have been  enough to pay the salaries of 129,000 full time  teachers.  It is one-and-a-half  times  what higher education spends for libraries  each year, and more than is spent on schol arships and student services.  Saving energy on a college campus is par ticularly hard: Students in dormitories burn  the midnight oil; libraries and laboratories  must be heated and lighted seven days a  week; the academic year runs through the  coldest and darkest months. This constant  drain on energy resources is aggravated by  the configuration of  the  typical campus:  many scattered buildings, some designed in  the last century with no thought to saving  energy.  Despite soaring costs, most campus admin istators have taken a piecemeal approach to  energy conservation. Much more can be  done than just turning down the thermo stats and dimming the lights. They need an  overall energy management plan.  Through a demonstration energy manage ment and financing program funded by the  John A. Hartford Foundation of New York  City,  the Higher Education Energy Task  Force is helping 12 colleges and universities  develop energy master plan of their own.  The plan is expected to save them up to 25  percent of their energy costs.  Chosen as a  representative sample,  the  campuses include both public and private,  large and small, from New Hampshire  to  California. Lincoln Land Community Col lege in Springfield is one of those participat ing in the program.  The Energy Task Force  is helping  the  campuses monitor and reduce their energy  use at modest additional expense,  largely  through  coordinated management  and  a  computerized energy  information manage ment system. At the same time, the project  is developing some  innovative methods  to  assist  campuses  to  afford  the  expensive  equipment and controls they will need  to  achieve maximum energy efficiency.  At the end of the demonstration period  late next year,  the comprehensive energy  management and financing system will be  transferred  to other campuses nationwide  through  publications  and workshops  for  campus administrators.  Overall, the program is designed to enable  campus administrators to embark on an effi cient, systematized approach to energy man agement. In light of soaring costs in every  area of their budgets, our nation's campuses  can no longer afford to let extra dollars go  up in smoke.e  REVITALIZE INDUSTRIAL BASE  HON. JAMES R. JONES  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 27, 1983   ",1983
812,550,13,Mr.  JONES  of  Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, I am today introducing legis lation with my colleague  from New  York <Mr. CoNABLE), aimed at revital",1983
813,589,13,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, the  issue of abortion is one of the most  difficult matters  that comes before  this body. There are very strong views  on both sides, arising from deeply felt  personal convictions, religious beliefs,  and moral perspectives.  My own view  is  that abortion is a  tragic result for everyone concerned. I  believe that the real solution lies in  the development of public policies to  provide  realistic  alternatives  that  would  help  reduce  the number  of  abortions. Throughout my career  in  the Senate, I have actively worked to  develop such alternatives, particularly  through support of programs to make  safe and reliable family planning serv ices available to those who seek serv ices in order to avoid unintended preg nancies, to provide necessary medical  services to those women who seek to  carry a pregnancy to term, and to fa cilitate the availability of adoption for  women who choose that option.  However, the real issue before us is  not what the personal views of any  Member of this body are with respect  to abortion, but rather whether gov ernment-at any level-should be al lowed  to  intervene  in and  limit  the  choices of  individual women  in  this  most personal, private, and difficult  area. The Supreme Court held  10  years ago, and reaffirmed 2 weeks ago,  that if the right to privacy means any thing, it means the right to be free  from unwarranted governmental  in trusion in this area. Under the Consti tution, at present,  the question of  abortion is a private one with the deci sion as to propriety and necessity left  to the individuals and physicians con cerned. That is how it should remain.  That is the view held by the vast ma jority of Americans. National public  opinion polls repeatedly show that an  overwhelming majority feel that deci sions about abortion are best left to  those  involved, guided by  their own  personal beliefs and convictions, free  from governmental interference.  Mr. President,  the proponents of  this amendment seek  to  impose  the  views of one side of the abortion issue  upon  those who hold different, but  equally firm convictions. That goal is  in fundamental conflict with the basic  concept of  individual freedom which  Americans have always held dear.  It is also clear, Mr. President, that  the proponents of  this  amendment  will not achieve their goal, even if this  amendment were added to the Consti tution.  Passage and ratification of Senate  Joint Resolution 3 will not resolve the  abortion debate-it will only prolong  it.  It will not halt abortions, but merely  change  the conditions under which  they are performed and the price to be  paid, both  in human and economic  terms.  The abortion fights which have re peatedly  paralyzed Congress would  become regular events in State legisla tures and  the  rights of  individuals  would  be  subjected  to  continuous  shifting majorities in State legislative  bodies, with one side prevailing one  year, and the other the next.  In  those States where  abortions  became illegal, we would see a return  to the days when unskilled abortion ists preyed upon desperate women.  The abortion mortality  rate, which  has almost disappeared would again  rise. Legal and safe abortions, howev er, would remain an option for those  women able to travel to other States  or countries. The less affluent would  be denied those choices.  Mr. President, once before  in  the  history of this Nation, we adopted an  amendment  which  attempted  to  impose the moral convictions of one  segment of our society upon the rest.  The 18th amendment was a miserable  failure. It bred disrespect for the law  among our people, made criminals out  of otherwise law-abiding citizens, and  created an  industry of illegal profit eers and corruption. Adoption of this  amendment would invite the same dire  consequences.  Finally, Mr. President, there are sub stantial reasons to oppose this particu lar  amendment  irrespective  of  the  abortion  issue. Senate Joint Resolu tion 3 would establish a  dangerous  precedent  for  resolution of disputes  over what are unquestionably funda mental and deeply controversial mat ters.  Unlike  the various other proposed  constitutional amendments related to  abortion, Senate Joint Resolution 3  would not, by itself, outlaw abortion.  Rather,  lacking  the  consensus  or  public support necessary to achieve an  outright ban, the proponents of this  amendment seek to reduce a constitu tionally protected right  to one that  could be limited or denied by a simple  majority vote of a State legislature or  the Congress. Citizens would be forced  to negotiate on a State-by-State basis  to assert what had been a fundamen tal  right. What other  fundamental  rights might be subjected next to this  approach? Should freedom of speech  or assembly or minority rights be sub jected  to State-by-State  determina tion?  Our Constitution stands as a safe guard against governmental intrusion  into individual freedoms wherever one  resides in the Nation. This amendment  would alter that relationship and es tablish a precedent that could later be  applied to other basic rights-an intol erable result, I believe.

While  the disagreement  over the resolution of this issue runs  deep,  it is clear that few people are  satisfied with the present state of un certainty.  Despite  repeated congressional  at tempts, State and local laws and judi cial rulings, our society has failed to  reach a consensus on the question of  abortion. In fact, contradictory poli cies seem to be the rule rather than  the exception.  A court in one State convicted a man  of murder for shooting and killing a  fetus  in a woman who survived  the  wound. A court in another State de clared that a fetus has the right to in herit property. State legislatures and  city councils have passed laws to re strict abortions and guarantee rights  to the unborn.  While some of these laws have been  struck down by  the Supreme Court  and some of the judicial rulings may  be overturned, they stand out as just a  few of the many examples of contra dictions  in our society's policies on  abortion.

823,602,13,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I com mend to my colleagues the following  outstanding analysis by Prof. John T.  Noonan, Jr., on the recent Supreme  Court abortion  ruling,  that will be  published in the summer 1983 edition  of the ""Human Life Review.""  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the above-mentioned article  appear at this point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  R~coan, as follows:  AKRON: A PRAGMATIC POLITICIAN'S PARODY  OF SOLOMON  Akron Center for Reproductive Health,  <By John T. Noonan, Jr.>  Pragmatists who believe that in any dis pute  you  can  split  the difference  have  looked at the life and death issue of abor tion and have come up with what  they  think is a workmanlike, democratic, sensi tive compromise. The abortionists get the  unrestricted  right  to  legal abortion. The  anti-abortionists get the right not to fund it.  A  fair division  they suppose. Half a  loaf  they say. Half a baby  they  imply. They  would have resolved the trinitarian conflict  of the fourth century by believing in one  and one-half persons. Here the pragmatists  say, they can kill, you don't have to pay for  it; or, they get the blood, you can keep the  money. This nice division of nonnegotiable  demands  is  the explanation of Akron v.  the  the  Supreme Court's  matter of abortion.  I speak of a decision ""in the matter of  abortion""  advisedly,  for  like  the Court's  other decisions in the area, this decision has  a curiously abstract air as tliough it were  not determining a contest between real per sons but were the draft of a legislative pro gram. An actual woman seeking an abortion  is not before the Court; the actual abortion  clinic with the Orwellian name which is the  plaintiff-its business methods, its business  motives-is never mentioned; the party most  at interest, the unborn child, is unrepresent ed. Abstractly structuring  the pragmatist  compromise, the Court affects the lives of  millions of human beings. It does so not as  judges deciding a concrete controversy but  as designers of a political solution-a ""final  settlement""  as  James Buchanan  said of  in  latest  decision  Dred Scott. 1  Written by Lewis Powell on behalf of him self and five of his male colleagues, Akron  shows that the old Roe v. Wade majority  has not only learned nothing but has paid  almost no attention to contemporary discov eries in medicine, currents in politics, or cri tiques of judicial imperialism. Locked into  the medicine of a decade ago, uncompre hending of the present political climate, dis dainful of conscientious remonstrance and  academic criticism, the entrenched majority  declares that a ""fundamental right to abor tion"" is to be found in the Constitution.  Unworkmanlike,  undemocratic,  insensi tive-these are the principal characteristics  of the opinion. Let us look at Akron in terms  of these characteristics.  UNWORKMANLIKE  Justice Powell begins by noting ""legisla tive responses"" and ""arguments"" that ""we  erred in interpreting the Constitution."" He  continues,  ""Nonetheless,  the doctrine of  stare decisis, while perhaps never entirely  persuasive on a constitutional question, is a  doctrine that demands respect in a society  gov~rned by the rule of law. We respect it  today, and reaffirm Roe v. Wade."" 2  What does Justice Powell mean when he  says that stare decisis-that is, the obliga tion to follow precedents-is ""perhaps never  entirely persuasive on a constitutional ques tion""?

824,615,13,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, the na tional debate on abortion continues to  be one of the most emotional and con troversial issues that we face today.  My position has always been that  the Federal Government should not  be  involved  in determining abortion  policy.  Unfortunately, Senate Joint Resolu tion 3 does not completely  remove  Congress  from determining abortion  policy.  The passage of  this constitutional  amendment may,  in  the end,  raise  more  questions  than  it  resolves.  Rather  than eliminating  the discus sion of abortion at the Federal level,  Senate Joint Resolution 3 may simply  continue  the  disjointed  debate  on  abortion that has been conducted over  the past 10 years within the Halls of  the Federal Congress.  For these reasons, I will vote against  Senate Joint Resolution 3.  ",1983
825,615,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  yield 7 minutes to the Senator from  Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).  ",1983
826,615,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Michigan.  ,1983
827,615,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, while I  shall vote against the Hatch-Eagleton  compromise  proposed  constitutional  amendment on abortion, Senate Joint  Resolution 3,  I happen to personally  oppose abortions which are not  the  result  of  danger  to  the mother's  health, rape, incest, or other unusual  circumstances. Were  I  asked  by  a  woman for advice regarding an abor tion,  I would advise her against  it,  absent  such unusual  circumstances.  My views are the product of my per sonal beliefs and morals. They differ  from the views of other persons, as is  evident  by  the  lack  of  consensus  among religious groups and the medi cal profession on the underlying ques tions relative to abortion. In the ab sence of such a consensus,  I believe  that the woman's right to make a pri vate  decision  concerning  abortion  should prevail as public policy, regard less  of our personal views  on  the  matter.  Mr. President, my objections to this  amendment are based principally upon  the views I have just outlined. There  are,  however, other  reasons why  I  cannot support this amendment.  The proposed amendment will not  put to rest the abortion controversy.  On  the  contrary-assuming  it does  have the effect intended by the spon sors of the amendment-it would sub ject the American public to a battle  over the abortion issue in each of the  50 States, since it would leave to the  determination of State legislatures the  question of whether abortion should  be restricted or prohibited altogether.  Nor would it remove the issue from  the Congress. Presumably,  the pro posed amendment would not affect  other possible sources of Federal au thority over  the regulation of abor tion, such as the commerce clause or  the spending powers. Since the amend ment  is silent on  the delegation of  powers between the States and Con gress, should it be approved, it is any body's guess what the rule of Congress  with respect to abortion will be.  Mr. President, whatever the resolu tion of our differences over the abor tion question, the law snould be uni form among the States. In Roe, the  Supreme Court recognized two important societal interests involved in the  abortion  decision-the  interest  in  ""protecting the potentiality of human  life"" and the interest in ""safeguarding  health and maintaining medical stand ards."" The Court's trimester approach  to determining when States have au thority to regulate abortions attempt ed to balance these sometimes compet ing interests.  While we might disagree with the  way the Court has balanced those in terests, I think we would all agree that  each of the interests identified by the  Court  in Roe  is  important. Because  the interests are so  important, I be lieve Americans have a right to uni formity  in the way the interests are  weighed. Under  the Hatch-Eagleton  amendment, the States would be free  to balance these interests as they see  fit, depending upon the views of a ma jorty in each State legislature. This  approach to the abortion issue would  result  in different rules  in different  States  and would  be  particularly  unfair  to  low-income  women. We  would be returned to a situation where  women with money could  travel  to  States where abortions are legal and  therefore  safer, while women who  could not afford to travel might again  resort to the ""back-alley"" abortion.  Our people are divided on the abor tion issue. But I believe most feel that  the same rule should be applicable as  a practical matter to all our people  wherever they live and whatever their  financial circumstances.  I am wondering, Mr. President, if I  might ask my friend, the Senator from  Utah <Mr. HATCH),  two or three ques tions  relative  to his  resolution,  the  constitutional amendment he has of fered? The first question is: Is there  any  implication  in  the sentence, ""A  right to abortion is not secured by this  Constitution,"" that abortion is prohib ited by the Constitution?  ",1983
828,615,13,Mr. HATCH.," No, Mr. President, the  language of this constitutional amend ment would neither  encourage nor  prohibit the issue of abortion within  the Constitution. It is no secret that I  personally would prefer  a  stronger  amendment to the Constitution that  would restrict abortion, but this par ticular amendment would allow  the  State legislatures to go any way they  want to on the issue.  I might add, if I could, that the pur pose of the amendment is to allow a  consensus-building process within the  elective branch of Government to re solve this very, very divisive issue.  ",1983
829,615,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Second, is it the inten tion of the proponents of this amend ment  that  the Constitution  remain  neutral on the legality of abortion?  ",1983

835,641,13,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, the Tax  Rate Equity Act we are considering  today achieves two very important ob jectives. First, it helps reduce our stag gering budget  deficit. But perhaps  more significantly, H.R. 1183 restores  much of the equity and fairness to our  tax system which has been lost during  the past few years.  The tax package enacted in 1981 re duced  revenues  to  the Treasury by  $1.1  trillion  from  fiscal  year  1982  through  fiscal year 1988. Last sum mer's tax increase bill recouped some  of this loss but left a staggering reve nue loss of $881 billion for the 7-year  period.  When the 1981 tax bill was enacted,  the administration assured us that the  revenue  loss would  be more  than  offset by  increased business  invest ments and increased savings. Yet the  predicted economic boom never came  to pass. Instead, we have been saddled  with the worst recession in this coun try in 40 years. Deficit levels are astro nomical.  In fact our problems with the Feder al  deficit may  actually  be  getting  worse. The Wall Street Journal report ed last week that the Federal deficit  totaled $29.29 billion for the month of  ¥ay. The deficit level for May 1982,  reached $18.9 billion. Administration  officials  indicated  that  this  year's  figure suggests a higher deficit level  for the year than originally forecast.  Indeed,  administration officials now  suggest  that  the  fiscal  1983  deficit  could reach $215 billion.  H.R.  1183  raises  a  significant  amount of revenue in the least painful  way available. It would raise $6.2 bil lion in fiscal year 1984. It would raise  $38.8 billion through fiscal year 1988.  H.R. 1183 produces prompt action to  stop the budget hemorrhage caused by  this administration's budget policies.  It is clear that a $700 cap on the  third-year tax cut is the fairest means  of reducing the deficit. The cap on the  tax cut restores some of  the equity  taken out of the tax system by this ad ministration  and  spreads  out  the  burden of economic sacrifice across all  segments of society. For too long this  administration has asked for sacrifices  to help us through our economic crisis,  but only from low-and middle-income  families.  The administration contends that a  $700  cap would  drown  the middle  class. This is curious when we consider  what  has  happened  to  America's  middle-income  earners  under  the  Reagan tax and budget packages thus  far. The Reagan tax cuts, when offset  by tax increases from social security  taxes and inflation, have resulted in a  22-percent increase in the tax burden  of  those  persons  earning  below  $10,000.  Persons  in  the  $10,000  to  $15,000 income group will see a 7-per cent increase in taxes. And those earn ing from $20,000 to $30,000 will shoul der a two-tenths of !-percent increase.  Yet,  if  you manage  to make  over  $200,000 and you will receive a 15-per cent decrease in your tax liability.  Further evidence of the administra tion's bias  toward  the well-to-do  is  found in studies done by the Congres sional Budget Office on the adminis tration  tax and budget changes  for  fiscal years 1982 through 1985. These  changes will  take more than $20 bil lion  from households with  incomes  below $10,000, yet  increase after-tax  income of households earning more  than $80,000 by $64 billion. An even  more glaring figure  is  the fact  that  fully 35 percent of the benefits gener ated by the 1981  tax cut go  to the  wealthiest 5 percent of American tax payers.  Is  this  concern  for  the middle income earners of America?  I  think  not, Mr. President. I think it is a con tinuation of  the  inequitable  trickle down approach which has guided this  administration.  The  administration  has  supported  increases  in gasoline  taxes which  are  clearly  regressive,  having a greater impact on the spend ing power of low-income groups. It has  supported  increases  in  telephone  excise taxes which have a detrimental  impact on our Nation's small business es. It has asked sacrifices of those who  wish to apply for student loans. It has  asked sacrifices from our military per sonnel. I feel that it is time we ask our  Nation's most prosperous citizens  to  sacrifice a portion of their tax cut and  to bear a fair measure of the burden  of cuts needed to sustain economic re covery.  I think we should stress, Mr. Presi dent, that nobody  is giving up their  tax cut. Our proposal retains the tax  cut. We are only advocating reducing  the size of the tax cut. As the Joint  Tax Committee's figures point out,  this proposal would reduce the size of  the tax cut only for an estimated 8.1  million  individual  taxpayers  in 1984.  This is roughly 10 percent of all U.S.  taxpayers. Thus, a full 90 percent of  our taxpayers would continue  to re ceive the full amount of the tax cuts  enacted in 1981.  The administration has argued that  many persons other than high-income  earners would  be  affected  by  this  measure. The  figures  dispute  this  claim. Only 9 percent of those earning  between $30,000 and $40,000 would be  affected by a $700 cap. Yet fully 93  percent  of  those  earning  between  $75,000 and $100,000 would see a re duction in the amount of their tax cut.  The fairness of  this approach can  also be seen by looking at where the  revenue raised by the cap would come  from;  89  percent  of  the  revenues  raised by  this bill would come from  taxpayers earning over $50,000; 60 per cent of  this sum comes  from  those  earning over $75,000.  Now,  these may be middle-income  earners in the circles the administra tion travels in, but a person with an  income level above $50,000 is still con sidered an upper  income earner by  Tennessee  standards.  Our median  family income in 1979 stood at $16,245  and only 4 percent of Tennessee fami lies were earning more than $50,000 in  that year.  H.R. 1183  also allows  the Federal  Government to raise revenues without  stalling our economic  recovery. The  tax cap still results in a tax cut of $24  billion in fiscal year 1984. This $24 bil lion will go far  in providing the  in creased purchasing power needed  to  continue our budding economic recov ery. As my colleagues know, lowand  middle-income  earners  tend  to  con sume a greater portion of  their  in comes than high-income earners and  these groups account for most of the  increase  in demand spawned by  tax  cuts.  Nor would a cap adversely affect the  backbone of our economy, the small  business community. Sole proprietor ships, the epitome of the American en trepreneur, accounted for 76 percent  of the total business establishments in  America  in 1979. Partnerships made  up 8 percent of the total while corpo rations represented 16 percent of the  overall figure.  11-059 0-87-21 (Pt. 13)  ",1983
836,693,13,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, on Tuesday, June 21, 1983, my  good  friend and colleague  from  Illi nois, Senator DIXON,  addressed  the  National Association of Governmental  Accountants at  their annual confer ence in Chicago.  The topic of Senator DrxoN's speech  that Tuesday morning was  the Uni form Single Financial Audit Act of  1983, of which I am the author and  which Senator DIXON is cosponsoring.  Mr. President,  this  speech  explains  very effectively the purpose and need  for this legislation, and how this ap proach, the single audit approach,  by  far  superior  to  the  fragmented  system which we have today.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of  that speech be printed in the RECORD.  The text follows:  is  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTAL  AccouNTANTS, JuNE 21, 1983  Good morning, I appreciate the opportu nity to speak to you today. I want to thank  your officers and my good friend, Bob Cron son, for inviting me. Bob and I have worked  together in Government over many years.  He  is an outstanding public servant and  leader who has served with distinction as  auditor general in illinois.  This week,  I am  joining with my good  friend and colleague, Senator DAVE DUREN BERGER of Minnesota, who ably serves as  chairman of the Subcommittee on Intergov ernmental Relations, in introducing legisla tion establishing uniform single  financial  audit requirements for State and local gov ernments and nonprofit organizations  re ceiving Federal funds. The bill is called the  Uniform Single Financial Audit Act of 1983.  All of you are aware of the single audit  concept, because it has been floating around  for some time. The Senate, as a matter of  fact, has previously passed similar legisla tion. The House, for a variety of reasons,  has balked in the past at this idea. Chances  on  the House side  this session, however,  seem to be much more favorable  than at  any time before.  So perhaps the long quest to inaugurate  the single audit is finally on the verge of  fruition. Let us hope so. Anything you can  do to make your personal views known to  your Senators, and later, your Congressmen,  will be very helpful.  Just  yesterday,  I  received  from Doug  Norton,  president of  the National State  Auditors Association, a copy of that organi zation's resolution endorsing our bill.  One can readily see the need for single  audit legislation by simply examining the  audit requirements currently contained  in  existing law or similar provisions proposed  in  legislation pending  in Congress. These  audit requirements are diverse and confus ing.  Because you work with them all of the  time, you are well aware that the Federal  Government's auditing standards are speci fied in the General Accounting Office's so called yellow book, known more formally as  Standards for Audit of Governmental Orga nizations, Programs, Activities and Func tions.  Despite the existence of these guidelines  and requirements, however, the General Ac counting Office still reminds us that most  legislation introduced in Congress requiring  audits contains incomplete and insufficient  audit language. The problem is compounded  if the faulty language eventually becomes  law.  Our legislation  is designed  to solve  this  and other problems. We steer away from  the  requirements and compliance  regula tions implemented by the Office of Manage ment and Budget. OMB's position  is  that  every grant, no matter what size or dollar  amount, must be audited and comply with  all Federal requirements and  regulations.  Such a complicated approach is very bur densome and costly to State and local gov ernments-as you all know, since you deal  with these situations almost daily.  Federal grants to State and local govern ments have, of course, been traditionally au dited on a grant-by-grant basis. Numerous  studies  conducted  over  the past  several  years, however, have sharply criticized this  approach to auditing as uncoordinated, inef ficient, and ineffective in insuring account ability in the use of Federal funds. As long  ago as 1977, the joint financial management  improvement program set up an audit im provement project. This undertaking  in volved the General Accounting Office, the  Office of Management  and Budget,  the  Treasury Department, and  the Office of  Personnel Management.  This agency's report ended on a critical  note of our audit procedures involving Fed eral funds. The report concludes by saying,  ""Our study corroborates the findings of pre vious studies by other organizations  that  considerable  duplication  and  overlap  of  effort exist  in auditing  federally assisted  programs and  that  there are substantial  gaps in audit coverage. Also, there is limited  coordination  of  audits  between  Federal  auditors or with State and  local auditors  and public accountants hired by recipients.""  That language pretty clearly states  the  case for our legislation. The report went on,  of course,  to examine  in detail what the  problems are.  In reviewing  the causes of  audit gaps, duplication, and overlap, for ex ample,  the  report noted  that under  the  grant-by-grant approach, there is limited co ordination even  among Federal auditors.  This lack of communication occurs because  each Federal agency typically audits its own  grants with  little or no concern  for  the  grant funds of other Federal agencies, thus  requiring separate audits by each.  Such an uncoordinated approach results  in  rather substantial gaps  in compliance  audit coverage or the need for additional  audits by Federal auditors. The overall pic ture confronting us on the audit scene is  one of a lack of coordination, a lack of com munication, and a lack of effectiveness.  Our bill  is  aimed at overcoming  these  problems by  introducing  the single audit  concept. Senator DURENBERGER's subcommit tee will be holding hearings on this proposal  on June 29. He has asked me to say to you  that he will be more than happy to receive  any written comments you may want  to  submit on this legislation. He tells me the  subcommittee record will probably be held  open for 30  to 60 days. I have brought a  copy of the bill with me today, and I am  sure my good friend, Bob Cronson, will see  to it that copies are made available to those  of you who are interested.  This legislation will, we hope, lessen audit  confusion on Federal, State, and local levels,  while simultaneously saving governmental  agencies money at a time when many gov ernmental bodies are cutting back. All of us  must, however, stick to our determination to  perform important essential services for our  citizens. Auditing ranks right up there on  the list, to assure that our tax dollars are  spent honestly, wisely, and well.e  EXPORT-IMPORT BANK  e ",1983

839,732,13,Mrs. SCHNEIDER.," Mr. Speaker, re cently,  efforts have been  launched  through the courts to restrict the en forcement powers of  title  IX. If al lowed to continue, such efforts will in  effect take the teeth out of title IX's  ability to fight discrimination in our  educational institutions.  In response to the decisions of this  past year, 170 of my colleagues have  joined me in support of my resolution  which reaffirms congressional support  for  the original,  comprehensive  en forcement powers of the title IX regu lations.  Among my colleagues, I have found  a  tremendous  lack of understanding  about what title IX does and does not  do. For  instance,  few Members will  argue against the goal of equality in  education. In fact, with the recent suc cess of Dr. Sally Ride, Members have  praised and expressed pride in the fact  that a woman has broken yet another  barrier of achievement. Yet, when we  get down to defending programs and  policies which guarantee equality  to  women, many Members  shirk  away  from action.  Much of the hesitation, I believe, is  due  to  misconceptions.  Somehow,  Members support equality  in admis sions or equality in specific academic  programs but cannot support title IX  because they are afraid it will weaken  the hometown football team or reduce  the local university basketball scholar ships. For example under  title 9  in  NCAA intercollegiate athletic depart ments, colleges spend $2,156 on every  female  athlete and $5,257  on each  male-a 144-percent difference. And  while women's athletic budgets in the  past 5 years have grown, men's budg ets have also increased some 20  to 30  percent. Title IX does not take dollars  away from men's athletic programs.  Last, an argument  I  hear almost  daily speaks  to  the fact  that men's  sports generate revenue that women's  programs do not. The truth  is  that  close to 65 percent of all men's athlet ic programs failed to generate the suf ficient  revenues  to  cover  expenses.  This included football and basketball  revenues as well.  Skeptics-wake up. Title IX does not  mean coed dorms, coed bathrooms, or  unisex basketball teams. It does mean  a fair shot at achieving an equal op portunity  for  educational  advance ment. Surely, the next generation of  women and men are entitled to this.  CONDEMNING PROTEST AT  VIETNAM MEMORIAL  <Mr.  SOLOMON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1983
840,732,13,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week,  I  joined Congressman CHRIS  SMITH and 22 other Members in sign ing a letter to Secretary of the Interi or James Watt. We have asked him to  keep  this Saturday's protest against  U.S. policy  in Central America from  being staged within obscenity-shouting  and  rock-throwing  distance  of  our  Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  The  issue, Mr. Speaker,  certainly  cannot be  free  speech. Lord knows,  any group of Marxists, peaceniks, and  assorted sixties leftovers is certain to  get their chance to mouth off in front  of the TV cameras most any time they  want.  But I, for one, resent seeing the pol ished black granite slabs of the Viet nam Memorial being used as the set  for  this anti-American extravaganza.  Most of all, I resent seeing the names  of  57,000  dead Americans  used  as  silent extras in a loud and sordid pro duction that will mock their patriot ism and their sacrifice.  It is time to bring the curtain down  on  this mockery. It is  really  just a  tired rerun of those street productions  staged a  few years back, with words  and music by Daniel Berrigan and  Abbie Hoffman.  This time, though, the arena is dif ferent. You can say what you want  about the design and  the setting of  the vietnam Memorial. But one thing  is certain-we built it for our brave  fallen soldiers, not Jane Fonda.  HOSPICES SHOULD BE ALLOWED  TO SUBCONTRACT WITH MEDI CARE CERTIFIED PROVIDERS  <Mr. BOEHLERT  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1983
841,732,13,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, over  the past few years, health care provid ers and  the Government have been  searching for more humane ways  to  care for  the  terminally  ill. Hospices  provide a unified approach to death  that combines medicine with humanis tic concern for patients, giving them  the chance to die with dignity and less  pain  among  those who  care  about  them most. As part of that effort, the  Congress last year passed  legislation  designed to promote hospice care by  making it eligible for medicare reim bursement.  Much attention has been focused on  proposed  regulations-now being  re written-that would have severely lim ited  the  amount of  care medicare  would pay for. But a less noticed provi sion in the actual law could have an  equally debilitating effect.  Included  in  the Tax Equity  and  Fiscal Responsibility Act were provi sions to extend reimbursement under  medicare  to  hospices-but  only  to  those able to provide all of four specif ic core services directly to patients. As  the law is written, a majority of hos pices in the United States are prohibit ed  from medicare  coverage because  they  subcontract health  care  serv ices-a practice current HHS regula tions does not permit.  The effect of this regulation in New  York State would be to make 92 per cent of the hospices participating in  the State's 3-year demonstration pro gram ineligible for medicare. Similar ly, 53 percent of  the hospital-based  hospices in the State would be ineligi ble.  We should be doing all we can to  enable  the  terminally  ill  receive  humane care at home. I strongly sup port the efforts to change portions of  existing law to allow hospices to sub contract with medicare certified pro viders. Each community has to deter mine its own needs, resources, and ob jectives while offering a decent, com passionate approach to the care of the  terminally ill.  0 1300  TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION  AMENDMENTS OF 1972  <Mr. McKERNAN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  Mr. McKERNAN. Mr. Speaker, as  we talk about title IX today, I would  like  to share with my colleagues a  brief article which appeared  in  the  June-July  1983,  Women's  Equity  Action League ""Washington Report""  on women in education.  While  the  success  of  title  IX  is  proven in the vastly increased higher  education accomplishments of women  students, the growth in student oppor tunities since the passage of title IV  has not yet translated into profession al advancement for women in educa tion. This report indicates that in the  fall of 1980, over half of the college  population were women. Participation  in nontraditional fields has skyrocket ed. ,-.Tomen went from 4 to 25 percent  of business students, from 9 to 23 per cent of medical students, and from 7  to 31 percent of law students.  But also in 1980, women held only 26  percent of the full-time faculty posi tions, only 10 percent of the professor",1983

845,745,13,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, before  I explain  this  bill,  I  think maybe I had better ex plain the process a little.  For all those who have ever exam ined the Tariff Act of 1930, which is  our basic document  from which we  work, you are going to be impressed by  the tremendous number of individual  items there are in those tariff sched ules that were adopted at that time by  Congress. I have never counted them,  in fact, I do not know anyone who has  ever counted  them, but  let me say  they  fill  volumes  thicker  than  the  Holy Bible. And I would guess there  would be at least hundreds of thou sands of  individual  items, perhaps a  million individual items.   So it is that spirit and sense that we  approach  this problem. Occasionally  there arises within the commerce and  the changes  that  take place  in  the  United States a need to adjust some of  those figures, to clarify them, and to  express Congress  latest wish on  the  matter.  This proposal that we are taking up  now and asking the House to suspend  the rules on is about as noncontrover sial as we can make a bill and still  have any substance in it.  This bill  iS designed and pulls  to gether some 23 other relatively non controversial bills and puts them all in  one package so that we can consider  them here without unnecessarily tying  up the House on considering each one  of these bills.  Each of these bills has a cosponsor  in  the Senate. And some may ask,  ""Why is that necessary?"" I have found  from experience that when this bill or  these bills go to the Senate that some times they languish over there for a  long period of  time. The gentleman  from Pennsylvania <Mr. WALKER) may  remember, because  I  think he was  about the only one on the floor last  year, that we finally passed most of  the bills last year after the House had  completed most of its formal business.  You could almost hear the sleigh bells  jingling as we  finished working on  this.  I hope that that will not occur again  because we offer these to the Senate  in good faith and hope that they will  take appropriate and speedy action.  Full hearings were held on all of  these bills and on other bills. And the  administration took a position on all  of the bills. We heard from the admin istration. We heard from the sponsor  of the bills. We heard from the sup porters of the bills. We heard from the  opponents of  these bills. We had a  markup in the Trade Subcommittee of  all these bills. We then took all the  bills to the Ways and Means Commit tee where we went through that proc ess again of markup and amendment.  Then we consolidated all the bills so  that we could consider them here all  at one time.  There are two  technical committee  amendments at the desk that I would  ask that we consider along with this  motion and I assume that the motion  to adopt those will be put at the time  the Chair puts  the question on  the  bill.  ",1983
846,745,13,The SPEAKER pro  tempore., The  Chair will advise the gentleman that  the amendments are  included  in the  gentleman's motion.  ,1983
847,745,13,Mr. GIBBONS.," I  man.  I will be happy to go through this  long list of items if anyone wants me  to and  to discourse on each one of  them, but I think at this time it would  be better that I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1983
848,745,13,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I  join my colleague in  support of H.R. 3398, an omnibus bill  making miscellaneous changes in the  tariff schedules and incorporating 23  separately  introduced bills. Most of  these provisions have encountered no  opposition. They will offer duty relief  to a wide range of domestic industries  and  thus will contribute  to efficient  and competitive domestic production.  The combined  impact of  this whole  package on the collection of Customs  revenues is $4.23 million in 1984 and  $7 million in 1985.  H.R. 3398 makes  several  changes. For  example,  it  thank the gentle types of  covers  a  group of products on which the duty  will be permanently eliminated. These  products  are  not  produced  in  the  United  States  and market  studies  show little evidence that they will be  produced here in the future. For prod ucts that someday may be produced  domestically, the bill provides tempo rary duty suspensions.  In  this way,  Congress  can  review  the  effect  of  duty-free treatment on any potential  for future domestic production.  A number of provisions adjust lan guage in the tariff schedules in order  to make classifications more uniform,  equitable  and  easier  to  administer.  Section 113 closes a  loophole  in  the  tariff distinction between work gloves  and dress gloves and will save revenue  by putting a stop to certain tariff eva sions. Hence,  the  taxpayer and  the  consumer as well as domestic produc ers stand to benefit from this legisla tion.  H.R.  3398  is  a  good  bill.  It will  reduce unnecessary tariff burdens on  domestic  industries and will  thereby  encourage economic expansion, espe cially in cases where domestic manu facturers of needed components only  have the capacity to supply a limited  segment of the domestic market. The  provisions of this bill are important to  the businesses involved and should be  put in place without delay.  I  re 0 1420  And, as the chairman of the subcom mittee stated earlier, this is a distilla tion of originally 54 bills. Some others  were added to that as we went along.  There were in the neighborhood of 60,  they were all scrutinized; and  these  were the 23 with the least controversy  which will, when put together in this  form, make a meaningful package and  a step in the right direction.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  join in support of H.R. 3398.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1983
849,745,13,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker,  serve the balance of my time.  ",1983
850,745,13,Mr. SCHULZE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  7 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. KINDNESS).  ",1983
851,745,13,Mr. KINDNESS.," I thank the gentle man from Pennsylvania for yielding  this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 3398-not the whole bill, but that  is the circumstance. We have the bill  here under suspension of  the rules,  and there is a part of the bill which, it  seems to me, needs to be focused upon.  It is regrettable that it was included in  H.R. 3398.  The report to accompany H.R. 3398  says that it is a bill which incorporates  23 noncontroversial  tariff and  trade  bills.  But,  unfortunately,  section  21l<a) of  the bill  incorporates what  used to be H.R. 657, a very controver sial measure.  Indeed, H.R. 657 was  ",1983

853,771,13,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  my colleague for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment  the  gentleman  from Oregon  <Mr.  AuCoiN)  for  the work  that he has  done on  this bill, particularly as  it  relate to the Forest Service aspects. I  have enjoyed working with him over  the  last several years since he has  become a member of the Interior Subcommittee.  ,  I want to thank our colleagues, par ticularly our chairman and the rank ing minority member, for the support  they have given to a balanced forestry  program.  In the Northwest we have had very  difficult  times  recently  because  of  high interest rates and what that has  done  to the housing industry, but I  think the kind of budget we now have  in place will help us deal with those  very difficult economic problems that  are still there.  I  commend  the  gentleman  from  Oregon, who has spent a great deal of  time mastering this subject matter. I  commend him for the leadership that  he has provided in making sure that  we  have  a  balanced  program  and  making sure that our environmental  concerns are protected as well.  ",1983
854,771,13,Mr. YATES.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman  from Tennessee <Mrs.  LLOYD).  ",1983
855,771,13,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R. 3363, and commend  subcommittee Chairman YATES for his  leadership in bringing to the floor re sponsible  appropriations  levels  for  fossil energy and conservation R&D  programs. I also want to congratulate  the subcommittee's ranking Republi can, Mr. McDADE, for his great efforts  at arriving at funding levels which will  provide stability to our Nation's R&D  efforts. Furthermore, I would like to  compliment my committee chairman,  Mr. FuQUA, for his hard work in pro viding authorization  levels for  fossil  energy and conservation R&D activities that are almost parallel to those  contained in the legislation before us  today.  The  total program  level  for  fossil  energy of $327 million  represents a  positive increase over the administra tion's continued shortsighted requests  for  these R&D activities which are  vital to our Nation's energy independ ence. This body has repeatedly denied  these  going-out-of-business  budgets,  and I am sure we will continue to pro vide adequate support for these criti cal energy programs.  I am grateful to Mr. WHITTEN, Mr.  YATES, and the committee for provid ing $7 million for a comprehensive en vironmental monitoring program to be  carried out by DOE in support of the  Synthetic Fuels Corporation. My ef forts to obtain support for this activity  derive from a desire to see the con cerns of Congress and the public ad dressed regarding the health, safety,  water  resources,  and  socioeconomic  issues associated with the development  of synfuels projects. By allowing DOE  to operate  in a  technical consulting  role  supporting  the  SFC, we will  insure that the Nation's best technical  expertise  is  integrated and  that the  environmental monitoring  programs  will have technical program continuity  regardless of the status of the Syn thetic Fuels Corporation.  With regard to the funding provided  for conservation programs, I am par ticularly pleased to note that the com mittee sustained DOE's request for $9  million to begin construction of a High  Temperature Materials Laboratory at  Oak Ridge. I believe that the research  to be conducted at the HTML will pro vide valuable information and will lead  to advancements in the use of materi als critical to energy efficiency.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support this important legislation.  ",1983

857,771,13,Mr.  FOWLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want to take this opportunity to ex press my support for the 1984 Interior  Department budget recommended by  the Appropriations Committee.  In particular, I would like to thank  Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  Chairman YATES  and his colleagues  for approving $1.388 million  in  the  U.S. Park Service budget for theM. L.  King, Jr., National Historic Site and  Preservation District.  The King Historic Site is an impor tant asset to Atlanta and the Nation.  Last year over 500,000 visitors came to  the park, not only to pay homage to  Dr. King but to learn more about the  story of the civil rights movement.  The historic site covers a  two-block  area encompassing the birth home of  Dr. King, his church, and his memori al gravesite. The preservation district  is composed of  the commercial and  residential  sections  of  the  Sweet  Auburn community in which Dr. King  grew up.  The $1.388 million budget for next  year will fund $500,000 for land acqui sition to acquire historic structures in  the area, $200,000 to restore the struc tures once acquired, $100,000 to devel op visitors exhibits, and $588,000  to  operate the park.  These funds are needed to continue  adequate development of  the park,  which is a relatively new unit of the  U.S. Park Service authorized in 1980  but first  funded  last year. For  this  reason, I strongly endorse the Appro priations Committee's  recommended  1984 funding for the King site.  ",1983

859,771,13,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of  the  legislation, and  I  would like to take this opportunity to  express my sincere gratitude  to  the  chairman  and  ranking  minority  member of the Subcommittee on Inte rior-Mr. YATES and Mr. McDADE,  re spectively-for their guidance in bring ing this legislation to the floor today.  I know I speak for many in Califor nia-many members of the California  delegation, county governments, costal  businesses,  and  people who  simply  enjoy our State's attractive and pro ductive coast-in offering my thanks  to you for your efforts bringing this  legislation  to the floor. This legisla tion contains a provision which would  exempt a small, but vital percentage of  California offshore area from offshore  oil and gas leasing during the coming  fiscal years, while still enabling  the  Federal Government  to continue  to  pursue energy leasing in most promis ing California offshore areas. In fact,  this  provision would  exempt  from  OCS oil and gas leasing only 9.2 per cent of  the acreage currently under  consideration for possible lease during  the 1984 fiscal year,  leaving over 12  million acres of Federal offshore land  open for lease.  California has made in the past-and  will continue  to make-a significant  contribution to OCS oil and gas pro duction. During the third quarter of  1982, California produced on the aver age over 1.2 million barrels of crude oil  per day from State and Federal on shore and offshore lands.  It is clear that some of our State's  most promising oil-producing areas lie  in Federal offshore waters. The one half billion barrel pt, Arguello field,  Chevron's 100 million barrel Sockeye  field strike, and the oil-rich Santa Bar bara Channel are all certain to con tribute to our Nation's energy security  through  the coming years. For this  reason, none of these most productive  areas would be affected by the OCS  leasing provisions of this bill.  ",1983

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of  this appropriations bill and  wish to acknowledge the fine work of  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  <Mr.  YATES).  The  bill which  he  brings  before us today is both a difficult one  and  a  very  important one  for our  country. SID YATES and his subcom mittee know the importance of main taining and preserving the real wealth  of our Nation. This bill takes care of  our forests, many of our natural re sources, and our environment. With out anything backing our money, all  that we have to pass on to our chil dren and our grandchildren is the vast  beauty, and wealth of our natural re sources.  I commend the work he has done,  and the ranking minority member of  this  subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  McDADE).  These  two gentlemen and the other  members of  this subcommittee have  worked hard  to bring  this House a  good bill; some have called it the all America bill and I agree with that.

867,784,13,Mr. HILER.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  these  four  amendments  because  I  would like to take issue with a portion  of  the  Interior  appropriations  bill  which I find  to be unconscionable in  view of the many critical funding pri orities  facing  the Federal Govern ment. This legislation attempts to in crease Federal spending for  the arts  and humanities by 15 percent in fiscal  year 1984, an increase of absurd pro portion when viewed  in  relation  to  funding requirements for Federal pro grams which meet more basic human  needs.  I certainly do not attempt to mini mize or belittle the important cultural  role which  the arts and humanities  play in our daily lives, and I would not  propose  to advance  the notion  that  the Federal Government should have  no involvement in this area.

873,810,13,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to congratulate  the outstanding  leadership  that  the gentleman  from  West Virginia <Mr. WISE) and the gen tlewoman  from Ohio <Ms. KAPTUR)  have been able to exhibit.  Many reports indicate that the econ omy has taken a  turn for the better.  While  this might be true at the na tional level, there are many pockets of  unemployment where  the  economy  has not improved. In fact, in some of  these cases the economic situation is  deteriorating, which, in turn, effects a  chain reaction diminishing the quality  of life for large numbers of people.  I  represent  the  27th District  in  Texas.  This  extends  from  Corpus  Christi south along the gulf coast to  Brownsville. In general, our economy  revolves around fishing,  farming, pe trochemicals, and port-related activi ties with  the Brownsville area more  dependent on tourism and retail sales.  The  difference  between  these  two  major cities  in my district-the  two  cities are 150 miles apart-is dramatic.  While  the  unemployment  rate  in  Corpus Christi is at near-record levels  at 10 percent, the unemployment rate  in Brownsville  is a crippling 17 per cent.  ",1983
874,823,13,Mr. RAHALL.," On behalf of the or ganizers  of  this  special  order  this  evening, my colleagues from West Vir ginia, Congressman WISE, Congress man  MoLLOHAN  and  Congressman  STAGGERS and my colleague from Ohio,  Congresswoman KAPTUR, we want to  thank all of those who have partici pated thus far this evening in this spe cial order and certainly  those who  have participated during the time that  I control, I want to extend my con gratulations on  statements  and  remarks very well written and spoken  from  the heart and very well  repre sentative of  their congressional dis tricts.  Mr. Speaker, tonight we heard the  President during his news conference  say  that the economy  is strong and  getting stronger. He went on  to say  that the American economy is begin ning to sparkle. For many in West Vir ginia, the only sparkle that they will  see during the months ahead may be  the sparkles of fireworks next Fourth  of July weekend. It is certainly not  any sparkle in the economy that they  are seeing. They have been without  jobs for several years now; they have  experienced not a recession but a de pression. And  it  is not getting any  better for  them. The issue of unem ployment has been a major  topic of  discussion on this floor of the House  of Representatives, not only in the last  several hours this evening but for the  last several years. During 1 minute  speeches, special orders, and debate on  various pieces of legislation, Members  have discussed the hardships of over  12 million Americans who are current ly without employment.  President Reagan takes great pleas ure  in  sharing with  the  public  in  speeches or at press conferences let ters  that he  receives  from  citizens  complimenting him on his work.  Rarely,  if ever, have  I heard him  refer to a letter which is  in disagree ment with him.  For this reason, I am happy to par ticipate in this special order and once  again  commend my  colleague  from  West Virginia for taking the time this  evening.  I  think  it  is  important as  many of my colleagues have already  done during  these special orders,  to  read what our constituents have to say  about the state of our Nation's econo my, letters that perhaps the President  has received also but to which he has  not referred in his press conferences  or speeches  to  the American people.  Before I do, however, I believe it is im portant to point out that in my dis trict the unemployment rate has gone  up in the last month. For that matter,  in five of the eight counties that com prise  the Fourth Congressional Dis trict in southern West Virginia the un employment rate has increased. If un employment is indeed one of the ""un fortunate evils"" of fighting  inflation  as this administration contends, then  why have we not turned the corner if  the economy  is  really here,  if  the  American  economy  is  truly gaining  strength?  The decrease in the rate of inflation  is  advertised as  the administration's  proudest achievement. Yet,  the facts  show that the average American is ac tually losing ground in real terms, as  per capita income in my State of West  Virginia is 20.3 percent below the na tional average. Corresponding  to  the  most recent statistics the percentage  of unemployed persons has increased  in southern West Virginia from 18.7  percent to 19 percent.  The number of  those out of work  has gone up from 29,130 to 29,390.  For  the  record,  I would  like  to  submit  the unemployment  totals for  the Fourth Congressional District for  May which show as follows:  In Cabell County the rate is 14 per cent,  Logan  County,  21  percent,  McDowell County, 30 percent. One of  the highest if not the highest unem ployment figures in the Nation for a  county and many in that county who  are affected would say that is on the  low side. Many in respectful positions  of leadership have said that the unem ployment in that county is approach ing 45 percent. Mercer County, 14.4  percent, Mingo County, 19.1 percent,  Raleigh County, 15.2 percent, Wayne  County,  12.9 percent and Wyoming  County, 25.7 percent rate of unem ployment for a district average of 19  percent.  The issue of unemployment is much  more human than these cold statistics  portray. From them we do not see the  unpaid bills, the hungry faces, the un certain  futures  and  the  shattered  dreams. In recent months I have been  saddened by many of the letters that I  have received from the people in my  district. They very clearly portray the  hardship,  frustration,  sense of  loss,  and the absence of any hope.  These individuals have worked for a  living before. They know what  it  is  like to put in a hard day's work for a  fair wage. They know what it takes to  pay bills, make mortgage payments  and to feed, clothe, and educate their  children.  It may sound corny but they do not  want handouts, they do not want to  stand in a welfare line, they want to  stand in a payroll line.  So,  tonight, Mr. Speaker,  for  the  President and for our colleagues who  do not see the need to participate in  this special order, I would like to read  just a few of the many letters that I  have received from constituents in the  Fourth District. They explain the situ ation much better than I could  this  evening and from a much more human  and personal standpoint.  From Accoville, W. Va.,  County, and I quote:  in Logan  ",1983

914,1005,13,Mr. DOLE.," I will just take 1 minute.  Mr. President, I wish to join the Sena tor from Mississippi and the Senator  from Missouri  in opposition  to  the  amendment.  I  think,  first of all,  if  there are still areas of waste or fraud  that we ought to address in the food  stamp program,  then that is  the re sponsibility we have in the authorizing  committee and one that we are going  to fulfill. There is always room for im provement  in  a  program  like  food  stamps, but, during the last 2 years we  have gone about as far as we can in  benefit reductions to recipients.  As chairman of the Nutrition Sub committee,  I  think  I  have made  it  clear over the past few months that  we  are not  just going  to  turn our  backs, because we cannot do any more  in food stamps. I think we have an ob ligation in all the programs over which  we have  jurisdiction  to continuously  monitor these programs to determine  whether or not we can reduce the Fed eral cost and reduce the cost to the  taxpayers in ways that will more effec tively target benefits and increase pro gram efficiency.  Overall, we have done a substantial  amount of cost reduction in the food  stamp program-over $2  billion per  year-and in the child nutrition pro grams. Maybe we ought to be spending  a little more on the WIC program, be cause it is very cost effective.  It would be my hope that we could  defeat this amendment for the reasons  outlined by the distinguished subcom mittee chairman and ranking minority  member. I think they have presented  an evenhanded approach  to  funding  the domestic nutrition programs.  If we are going  to force  the Con gress, directly or indirectly, to either  reduce benefits across  the board or  somehow make massive budget cuts in  the program, I  think that is a choice  that we should properly make through  the authorizing  legislation,  and  the  regular committee process.  Mr. President,  for  the  first  time  since 1977, we do not have  to make  any major changes in the food stamp  program. Last year, the program was  reauthorized for 3 years, and this year  we do not have to raise the spending  ceiling in order to accommodate sup plemental appropriations. Also, we do  not have to fulfill any reconciliation  instructions. After  the  layer  upon  layer of massive changes during the  last 6 years, this program deserves a  period of stability.  In my view, we have made a lot of  progress in addressing problem areas  in the nutrition programs, and a lot of  it is due to the efforts of the distin guished chairman of  the committee,  Senator HELMS. but we have to moni tor these programs continuously. We  have a few social programs under the  jurisdiction of  the Finance Commit tee-medicaid, welfare, and other pro grams. I would indicate that in some  of those areas we have gone about as  far as we can go in budget cuts. There  are a lot of other areas on the spend ing side over which we have jurisdic tion that have hardly been touched at  all. We are looking. at some of those  programs in the Senate Finance Com mittee to see if we can make appropri ate savings.  Mr. President,  the fiscal year 1984  agriculture appropriations bill which  we are now considering contains par tial-year funding for the Federal nu trition programs: it funds the special  supplemental  food  program  for  women,  infants, and children <WIC)  through July 10;  it funds  the school  lunch and other child nutrition pro grams through August 15; and it funds  the food stamp program through Sep tember 6.  The  Appropriations  Committee  funded  these programs for only part  of the year, because the funding levels  contained  in  the President's  request  were  too  low  to carry the programs  through  the  full year unless major  benefit reductions are enacted.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment  introduced by the chairman of the Ag riculture Committee. This amendment  would maintain the same funding level  as in the committee bill, but it would  require this funding to be spread over  the entire 12 months.  EVENHANDED APPROACH OF APPROPRIATIONS  COMMITTEE  Mr. President,  the Agriculture ap propriations bill reported by the com mittee under the distinguished leader ship of the Senator from Mississippi,  Mr. CocHRAN, represents an evenhand ed approach  to funding for domestic  food assistance.  With regard to the food stamp pro gram, this bill provides the amount of  funds requested by the administration,  but  specifies  that  these  funds  are  available only  through September 6,  1984.  If the Congress  subsequently  enacts  the administration's proposed  budget cuts  totaling $766 million  in  food stamps, then no additional food  stamp funds will be needed. If Con gress does not enact these budget re ductions, supplemental appropriations  would be provided next year to carry  the program through the remainder of  September.  Spreading the funding level for child  nutrition programs over the full year  is an attempt to gain leverage for the  administration's proposed budget cuts  of $300 million, which would be in ad dition to the $1.5 billion a year in cuts  enacted  in 1981. These cuts reduced  child nutrition funding by 30 percent  and school lunch enrollment by about  3 million children.  The  appropriations  bill  provides  $1.060 billion for WIC  through July  10, in order to maintain WIC partici pation at 2.8 million persons. This is  the number of low-income women, in fants,  and children  that CBO  esti mates will be participating in WIC at  the end of r  al year 1983. Under the  Helms amendment, the $1.060 billion  would be spread over  the entire 12  months  of  fiscal  year  1984, which  USDA estimates would serve 2.15 mil lion persons next year.  CONCLUSION  Mr.  President,  this  amendment  should be defeated, because it implies  benefit  reductions  for  the nutrition  programs if the partial-year funding is  stretched over  the entire 12-month  1984 fiscal year.  Mr. President, I oppose the amend ment.  ",1983
915,1005,13,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, Ire member when I served in the House of  Representatives  there was  a  great  debate about the fact  that the food  stamp program had gone completely  out of control. The distinguished occu pant of the chair probably remembers  that debate when it was first brought  up. There was a great deal of argu ment over how we would control the  cost of this runaway program, the cost  that was going to escalate to as much  as $5 billion a year.  There were great differences of opin ion about how you go about control ling the cost, because it was a period  of high unemployment and economic  recession. The cost of  the program  went up automatically,  in effect, be cause if a person was entitled to bene fits under the terms of the law,  the  Government appropriated the dollars  to meet its obligation.  There are a  lot of programs  that.  It is not a pure entitlement program,  because it does come up each year for  direct appropriations under the law by  which it was created. But it was never  intended, and this came out in debate  several years ago and I am sure other  Senators are familiar with this, that  the Congress would act to control the  program by capping the level of spend ing available during each fiscal year.  That was tried. That is what is being  attempted here, in a way.  I am not suggesting that the amend ment is not straightforward, because it  certainly is. But what it would do, in  effect, is hold the level of funding at a  point below which we anticipate the  programs to actually cost.  like  ",1983
916,1018,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  question is on agreeing to the amend ment of the Senator from Mississippi.  Mr.  CocHRAN's  amendment  <No.  1448) was agreed to.  ,1983
917,1018,13,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I want  to call attention to some very curious  language  in  this Agriculture appro priations bill with regard  to funding  for the special supplemental food pro gram  for women,  infants, and chil dren.  The bill states thatFunds provided shall be expended in such  a manner as to insure that the average par ticipation during the period from October 1,  1983, through July 10, 1984, does not fall  below 2,800,000 persons.  I do not know how State, local, or  Federal officials are supposed to know  how  to administer such a provision.  Are they supposed to go out recruiting  WIC participants if the participation  is below that level?  Mr. President,  it should be noted  also that the basis for the 2.8 million  persons  is  one which  is  constantly  changing. That was  the estimate of  the Congressional Budget Office earli er this year based on the assumption  that 2.8 million persons would be par ticipating by  the end of  fiscal year  1983. That may not be the case at all  by the time the fiscal year begins.  Most recent participation levels indi cate  approximately  2.4 million per sons. While  there  is expected  to be  some increase, based on the additional  funding contained in the jobs bill ear lier  this year,  that  is by no means  guaranteed.  It seems imprudent in the extreme  to specify minimum levels of participa tion.  I should also point out that funding  at the  level contained  in  the appro priations bill would result in exceeding  the current authorization level by the  end of fiscal year 1984.  If the authorized  level  is  insuffi cient,  our  committee will  need  to  assess the participation characteristics  to determine whether a lifting of the  ceiling is appropriate.  There are a good number of con cerns, first  identified by the General  Accounting Office, about the uniform ity  in defining ""nutritional  risk"" of  participants. In some areas, apparent ly belonging to a particular group or  social class may make one eligible re gardless  of one's actual  nutritional  status.  I think we must recognize that when  a program such as WIC begins to have  20 percent of all infants enrolled in it,  we need  to scrutinize whether  it  is  being sufficiently targeted to the poor  who are undernourished or whether it  has grown beyond its original purpose.  Nonetheless, with regard to the spe cific language contained in the bill, I  think it is likely to be unenforceable if  it even can be deciphered.  I also want to comment on the unan imous consent request adopted earlier  changing the Puerto Rican  language  to provide a 3-month delay for imple menting a noncash form of assistance.  I  believe  that  the  compromise  on  Puerto Rico  is  a  good  one.  I  feel  strongly that the prerogatives of the  authorizing committees should not be  infringed upon by the Appropriations  Committee. I can imagine the uproar  which would ensue if any authorizing  committee attempted  to appropriate  money.  I  recognize that this is  the vehicle  which  is moving at the present in a  timely manner which could provide  some relief for Puerto Rico's current  October 1 deadline  for changing  to  some noncash form of assistance.  I believe that the Puerto Rican gov ernment should have the option of es tablishing the form of assistance that  they believe  is most effective. They  have chosen a cash form which, by  most reports, has worked quite well.  Indeed, the support for the system has  been widespread. The use of cash has  been  coupled with many  improve ments in the operation of the program  which have been urged by many com petent caseworkers across the country  for years.  This  amendment will  insure  that  Puerto Rico does not have to change  the assistance on October 1. Yet it will  preserve the prerogatives of the Com mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry to deal with the long-term so lution  to  the  problem  later  this  summer.  I commend my colleagues for their  agreement  to  this  compromise.  I  assure them that this matter will re ceive  careful  consideration  in  due  course before our committee.  AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL REMAINS  UNFAIR TO U.S. CONSUMER  ",1983
918,1018,13,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I have de cided to vote against Senate passage of  the agricultural appropriations bill be cause I believe it remains far too gen erous to the private agricultural indus try and unfair to taxpayers and con sumers.  It is particularly unfair  to  heavily  burdened  families  relying  upon food stamps.  At a time when the majority of the  Senate has approved deep cuts in es sential health, education, and employ ment programs and, particularly, at a  time when the Nation is saddled with  a  rapidly growing deficit, a  subsidy  laden agricultural appropriations bill  cannot be justified.  Although this bill contains funding  for vital child nutrition programs and  food stamps, the amounts are woefully  inadequate. The Congressional Budget  Office has reported that the appropri ated funding level will result in a loss  of about $50  to $100 per  recipient  family in food stamp benefits.  It is wrong to ask taxpayers to pay  for overblown price-support programs  that only assure consumer prices will  remain high. When we are asking our  citizens to tighten their belts, I cannot  support the payment of massive subsi dies  to the agricultural industry nor  the cuts  in  food stamp benefits for  those who need them.  ",1983
919,1018,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to commend my colleagues from  Missouri and Mississippi for their fine  work on  the Agriculture appropria tions bill, H.R. 3223, that is before the  Senate today. There are several items  included in the bill that are of special  interest to the State of Michigan and I  would like to mention two of them to  my colleagues.  First, the Agriculture appropriations  bill includes $200,000 for research on  dioxin in the food chain. This research  project will be performed at Michigan  State University, one of  the oldest  ",1983
920,1044,13,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  today  I  am  introducing  legislation  which would  require  that Federal  agencies and the U.S. Senate recover  the costs of meals served in executive  dining rooms. Let me first explain to  my colleagues what  this  legislation  will  do  and  then why  I  believe  it  should be promptly passed.  Most Federal agencies here  in  the  Washington  area  have  executive  dining rooms. Not  just everyone can  eat in these exclusive rooms. Admit tance is limited, usually to those at the  GS-15  level or higher. That  limited  access means  that  those  fortunate  enough  to be  admitted make  good  money-$50,000  to $60,000 a year or  more. Those salaries are two to three  times what  the  average American  family makes.  Most of these dining rooms are not  little  cubbyhole  affairs. Many  seat  over 50 and some nearly 100. As many  as 20 employees-cooks and waiters work in some of these dining rooms.  Mr. President, they are not some con ference  room  temporarily  converted  for  the  convenience of  the  agency  head.  result of  the scale of  these  dining rooms, they can be expensive to  As a  operate. In fiscal year 1981, the Penta gon spent about $450,000 each to oper ate dining rooms for the Secretary of  Defense and the heads of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force. Many civilian  agencies  spent between $50,000  and  $100,000 to operate their dining rooms.  As might be  expected,  the prices  -charged for  the meals did not come  anywhere near covering the costs of  providing those meals. In fiscal year  1981, it cost about $2,900,000 to oper ate these dining rooms while the reve nues  collected  from  those who  ate  there barely topped $500,000. The tax payer paid the $2,400,000 difference.  Thus we have the spectacle, Mr. Presi dent, of  those earning  two  to  three  times  the average  taxpayer's wages  using the coercive power of the Inter nal Revenue Code to force that same  taxpayer to pay for their meals. That  is just plain wrong.  My legislation would remedy this sit uation. It requires that those who eat  in these dining rooms pay their cost of  operation. Nothing more, nothing less.  Mr. President, this legislation estab lishes the same incentives for the Fed eral Government  that  any  private  businessman must face. If the dining  room managers watch their costs, they  can serve a meal at about the same  price a private restaurant charges. If  costs are allowed to balloon, then the  prices  charged will  have  to be  in creased. Nothing could be more fair.  I would  apply  the  same  rule  to  Senate cafeterias and dining  rooms.  Last year, it cost about $5 million to  operate these dining rooms and all but  $35,000 of that sum was paid by the  patrons. Current policy  is  to break  even on these restaurants and my bill  would make this policy law.  The Senate should promptly consid er  this  legislation. The Nation  is  facing unprecedented deficits.  In an  effort  to  control  these deficits, we  have  slowed  the  rate of growth of  many social programs, including food  stamps.  In addition,  the administra tion strongly supports the concept of  user fees. This legislation is a perfect  vehicle to put that concept into prac tice.  Mr. President, in our efforts to con trol the deficit, we should be fair. Ev eryone should make a  sacrifice, not  just the poor. That ""everyone"" should  include  powerful Government  offi cials, who are now eating  in dining  rooms heavily subsidized by the tax payer.  I ask unanimous consent  that the  text of my bill  be printed  in  the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  s. 1562  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as the ""No Free Lunch Act  of 1983"".  SEc. 2. For the purposes of this Act, ""exec utive dining room"" means any dining room  which is located in an office building used  by any agency in the Executive branch and  where breakfast, lunch, or dinner is avail able only to an officer or employee of the  Government serving in a position in the Ex ecutive branch in grade GS-15 or above, Ex ecutive Level V or above, or colonel or  above, or their guests or was available only  to such officers or employees or their guests  before the date of enactment of this Act.  SEc. 3. Each person receiving a meal in an  executive dining room or a Senate dining fa cility shall be charged for such meal a price  in an amount which  is not  less  than an  amount sufficient to defray the cost of pro viding such meal considering the cost of the  food,  labor, and utilities, and the deprecia tion of equipment used  in providing such  meal.  SEc. 4. Sums collected pursuant to section  3 shall be deposited in the Treasury of the  United States as miscellaneous receipts.  By Mr. STEVENS:  S. 1563. A bill to amend section 204  of the Federal Property and Adminis trative Services Act of 1949 to author ize the deposit of cash proceeds from  the disposal of excess or surplus prop erty  into  the general  fund  of  the  Treasury for use to retire the national  debt;  to  the Committee on Govern mental Affairs.  NATIONAL DEBT RETIREMENT ACT OF 1983  ",1983
921,1044,13,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, today  I  am  introducing a bill designed  to  begin the process of reducing the size  of the national debt.  Every year we face the difficult task  of balancing the budget. Only once in  the last 20 years have we been success ful. The current national debt is the  result of decades of a ""buy now, pay  later"" approach  to financing of gov ernment programs. It is a debt that  many Members of Congress and past  administrations, both Republican and  Democratic, supported in attempts to  improve our society. But the deficits  we produce each year do not go away.  They continue to accumulate, increas ing the size of our national debt.  In 1981, the public debt passed the 1  trillion mark  for  the first  time. By  May  of  this year  that  figure  had  reached almost $1.3 trillion. It is diffi cult to grasp what these huge numbers  represent.  Broken  down  into  per  capita terms, the debt in 1972 equaled  just over $2,000 per person  in  the  United States. In May of this year, the  debt per person was well over $5,000.  Even more revealing is the cost of fi nancing this debt. From 1954 to 1981  the Federal debt held by the public in creased by almost four times. During  this same time,  the interest paid on  the debt  increased by 15  times.  In  1982, the accrued interest cost on the  debt was over $117 billion. By April of  this year, we were adding another $1  million to that figure every 5 minutes.  These are funds which do not go for  ",1983
922,1070,13,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I am in troducing a bill  today which would  retain the present duty on imported  canned corned beef for a period of 6  years beginning this October.  There is virtually no domestic pro duction of canned corned beef. In fact,  this product, all of which is imported,  amounts  to only 0.02 percent of the  total U.S. meat supply.  Nearly all canned corned beef is im ported from two countries: Argentina  and Brazil. The present duty is 3 per cent and will remain at that level until  October 30, 1983, when the duty on  Brazilian corned beef will rise to 7 '12  percent.  The  present  3-percent  duty was  originally  enacted  in  1979 when  a  trade treaty was signed with Argenti",1983
923,1096,13,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, when  the Rehabilitation Amendments  of  1983, S. 1340, comes before  the full  Senate for consideration, I will be of fering an amendment, on behalf of  myself, Mr. DOMENICI, and Mr. PELL to  raise the authorization ceilings for vo cational  and  adult  education  pro grams.  When Congress passed the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, we  placed a cap or ceiling on the amount  that could be appropriated for voca tional and adult programs at $735 mil lion for vocational education, and $100  million  for adult education.  In  the  case of vocational education, we did  not lower the maximum authorization  level of over $1 billion, we simply lim ited the amount that could be appro priated, through 1984, at $735 million.  For fiscal year 1983, vocational pro grams are funded at over $728 million,  just $7 million below  the cap, and  adult education  is receiving $95 mil lion, only $5 million less than the ceil ing. That leaves us in a real bind when  we sit down to determine appropria tions for fiscal year 1984 for these pro grams.  There is a general consensus that vo cational and adult education programs  are critical ones that should be main tained and continue growing to meet  the training needs of youth, and the  basic education and retraining needs  of adults.  We are still experiencing unemploy ment rates of over 10 percent. Unem ployment among black Americans  is  over 20 percent, and 45 percent of the  Nation's  black  youth  cannot  find  work. Yet our defense and domestic in dustries are facing critical shortages of  workers with high  technology skills.  Not too long ago we enacted a special  appropriations package to create jobs  through existing programs. No addi tional funds were added to vocational  or adult education programs because  of the ceilings. We are neglecting an  important rung in the ladder to eco nomic recovery if we do not adequate ly fund these programs in 1984.  The budget  resolution we adopted  has ample room to accommodate the  ceilings I am proposing with my col leagues  today. The House version of  the Rehabilitation Act  amendments  contains the same levels for vocational  and adult education. As the Education  Subcommittees in the House and the  Senate continue to work on the vari ous proposals to reauthorize vocation al education after 1984,  I  think we  ought to adopt these ceilings so the  program can continue the gains it has  made in the meantime.

924,1109,13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, on May  20, 1983, I asked unanimous consent to  have printed in the RECORD some valu able material on a nuclear freeze pro posal prepared by Mr. Christopher  Paine of the Federation of American  Scientists. One of  the most useful  parts of that material was a  table 5  containing  the outline of a  compre hensive nuclear freeze and reductions  agreement. Unfortunately, table 5 was  not included in the material as printed  in the RECORD. This greatly diminishes  the value of Mr. Paine's excellent  statement on a nuclear freeze propos al.  I  ask,  therefore,  that  the  entire  statement of Mr. Paine before a panel  organized by the Federation of Ameri can Scientists,  including  the missing  table  5,  be printed  in  full  in  the  RECORD at this point.  The material follows:  [Prepared testimony of Christopher E.  Paine]  RETHINKING ARMS CONTROL: ADVANTAGES OF  ' A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH  The burden of my testimony today is that  a comprehensive approach to ending the nu clear arms race is both politically and tech nically feasible, and in fact offers distinct  verification and security advantages over  more limited approaches.  Although traditional thinking about arms  control comes encased in a veneer of pur portedly technical constraints, close exami nation  reveals  that  these are not purely  technical  constraints,  but  rather  limits  based on subjective-indeed highly politi cal-determinations of the ""national inter est"" and the fragility of the nuclear balance.  For example, if you believe that the balance  in specific measures of nuclear capability is  an oracle of geopolitical fortune, you will  probably demand high levels of on-site in spection to monitor each and every incre mental improvement in the Soviet nuclear  arsenal, on  the grounds  that  the United  States must be able to respond promptly to  Soviet efforts  to change  the balance, no  matter how small these may be in relation  to the total arsenals.  On the other hand, if you believe, as I do,  that the destiny of world affairs depends far  less on the balance in nuclear capabilities  than on the dangers arising from the race to  maintain  these capabilities,  then you are  likely to have a far different set of preferences. Specifically, if one reaches the con clusion that the nuclear balance is, within a  fairly broad range of disparities, inherently  stable with respect to the deliberate initi ation of nuclear conflict, then one is willing  to  tolerate  a  comprehensive  agreement  characterized by lower-levels of monitoring  confidence  for marginal  changes  in  the  Soviet arsenal, in exchange for a halt in the  overall process.  Between these  two extremes lies a wide  and fertile ground for exploration and com promise. It behooves us all to examine the  actual range of possibilities that really do  exist, rather than continue to dwell in the  small box <see Figure 1 > defined by  the  present Administration's  ideological  and  strategic preoccupations.  [Figure  1  not  reproducible  the  for  RECORD.]  For example, it is often said that in addi tion  to National Technical Means <NTM>  the Freeze will require ""on-site inspection,""  which the Soviets will presumably be un willing  to grant. What kind of National  Technical Means? What kind of ""on-site"" in spection? And can these be used in combina tion? There are many possible combinations  <Table 1) of current <and feasible near-term>  NTM, intrusiveness, frequency of coverage,  cooperative measures, and information ex change, yielding a wide  range of possible  confidence levels when applied  to a broad  spectrum of possible agreements. Some of  these possibilities are spelled out in Table 2.  [Tables 1 and 2 not reproducible for the  RECORD.]  EXPLANATION OF TABLE 2.-ILLUSTRATIVE  MODES OF MONITORING COMPLIANCE  Inspec 1. Remote monitoring by National Techni cal Means outside Soviet territory.  2. Remote monitoring by  tamper proof  NTM located within Soviet territory.  3. On-site monitoring by non-intrusive in spections using technical means.  4. On-site monitoring by mildly intrusive  inspections using technical means.  5. Intrusive ""Quota"" Inspections.  6.  Intrusive Continuous On-Site  tion.  7. Inspection by the Public <report a viola tion if you've seen or heard of one).  8. Data base exchange.  9. Cooperative measures on request <re moval of shielding against NTM>.  10. Inspection by Interrogation, hierarchy  of requests for clarification and responses,  leading to a prima facie case of violation or  compliance with the right to request inspec tion to resolve doubts.  Similarly, the problem of treaty compli ance is not a simple ""yes they are-no they are not""; kind of problem. There is in fact a  wide range of possible forms of treaty non compliance <Table 3) and a wide range of  possible  responses  to  treaty  violations  <Table 4). We need to know, for example,  which violations in Table 3 should be paired  with which remedies in Table 4? What kinds  of  treaty violations  threaten our security  such  that  they would  justify abrogation,  and what kind of violations would merit  lesser actions. In short, there is a great deal  of investigation to be done here, and from  one perspective, perhaps the most we can  say is to admit the scale of our current igno rance and get to work. One way of looking  at the range of possibilities is summarized in  Figure 1, which attempts to show geometri cally how differences  in  three  important  subjective preferences relating to arms con trol can affect the domain of possible agree ment.

Intentional Systematic violation on Ex ecutive orders to achieve Treaty Breakout/  Strategic Superiority.  2.  Intentional  violation  on  Executive  orders  to  achieve  new  capability within  Treaty regime.  3.  Intentional  violation  orders  to achieve marginal  within Treaty regime.  4.

""Apparent  violations"" which  arise  from  developments which  are  inherently  ambiguous at certain stages but which are  later revealed to be consistent with treaty  requirements.  12.

Signatures  registered by monitoring  systems mistaken  for  prohibited  activity  <e.g. gas fire for ground-based laser, earth quake for nuclear test>.  14. Charges of violations arising from in adequate  information  concerning  activity  under observation.  EXPLANATION FOR TABLE 4.-POSSIBLE  REMEDIES TO TREATY VIOLATIONS  1. Reinterpretation of Treaty Provisions  to eliminate violation.  2. ""Consent Decree"" not to engage again  in specific forms of activity whether or not  these are judged to be ""violations"" of the  agreement.  3. ""Tit for Tat"" limited retaliation in re sponse  to prohibited  activity,  limited  in  scope but not necessarily identical to adver sary's action.  4. Denial of rights under the treaty, such  as inspections or data exchange, until pro hibited activity ceases.  5. Withdrawal  from part of the Treaty  until adversary violations cease.  6. Suspension of Compliance with Entire  Treaty until violations cease.  7. Withdrawal from the Treaty.  8. Punitive International Sanctions.  However,  I would  like  to  suggest  that  there  are  sound  technical  and  political  grounds for believing in the validity of the  comprehensive approach. This is set forth  in detail in Table 5 and represented sche matically in Figure 2, ""A Nuclear Weapons  Freeze Verification Flow Chart.""

925,1122,13,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President. I am  greatly concerned that foreign policy  decisions often have been made with out  due  regard  to  their  economic  impact on U.S. business. A very signifi cant portion of this country's econom ic system  is highly dependent upon  foreign sales and purchases. A foreign  policy decision can have a devastating  economic impact on a domestic indus try. The 1980 Russian grain embargo  imposed by the Carter administration  is a classic example.  While I would not suggest that na tional security should be secondary to  economic  impact,  I  question  the  extent  to  which  economic  conse quences have been taken into consid eration-if at all-when foreign policy  decisions are made. In my judgment,  maintaining  incentives  and  rewards  within our economic system is also in  our Nation's interest. It is not in our  best interest to use ""national security""  as a catch-all excuse to justify unwar ranted  intrustion  into  international  trade.  With that thought in mind I asked  the General Accounting Office <GAO>  to  research  the organization of  the  Reagan administration's foreign policy  decisionmaking process and how com pensation is made to industries when  export controls are imposed.  I ask that excerpts from GAO's May  12 letter report, entitled ""Interagency  Structure of Economic and Foreign  Policy Decisionmaking"" <GAO/ID-8341), be reprinted in the RECORD.  The excerpts are as follows:  EXECUTIVE BRANCH ORGANIZATION  Under the Reagan administration,  inter agency policymaking is formally structured  and extensively used. High-level interagency  policymaking is carried out through a group  of senior interagency groups associated with  the NSC, and a number of cabinet councils.  Senior interagency groups <SIGs> are set up  under the NSC umbrella for foreign affairs,  defense policy, intelligence policy, and inter national economic policy. They are chaired  respectively by State, Defense, the Central  Intelligence Agency, and Treasury.  Inter agency groups <IGs> typically focus on limit ed  issues and have varying membership,  size, and responsibilities depending on the  issues under review. As may be expected,  the NSC groups are concerned mostly with  international political and military issues.  A series of cabinet councils set up by  President Reagan to deliberate administra tion policies are, on  the whole, concerned  with domestic issues. Such issues, of course,  encompass international economic concerns.  To date, seven councils have been estab lished, each chaired by the President with a  cabinet-level  chairman pro  tempore,  and  each group has an Executive Secretary in  the White House Office of Policy Develop ment at the level of Special Assistant to the  President or above.  The Cabinet Councils <and Secretary-rank  chairman pro  tempore> are: Economic Af fairs  <Treasury);  Commerce  and  Trade  <Commerce>; Food and Agriculture <Agricul ture>; Natural Resources and the Environ ment <Interior>; Human Resources <Health  and Human Services>; Management and Ad ministration <Counsellor  to  the President)  and Legal Policy <Attorney General).  The Cabinet Council on Economic affairs  has reportedly been the most active of the  councils. Although  it was  initially  envi sioned as a  forum  for domestic economic  concerns,  the council has considered such  international  issues as  the yen-dollar ex change rate and U.S. participation financial  institutions.  The Cabinet Council on Commerce and  Trade, has been a relatively active council.  It has operated in tandem with the Trade  Policy Committee, an interagency group es tablished in the 1962 legislation setting up  the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  <OUSTR>. Most trade issues continue to go  through  the  Trade  Policy  Committee,  chaired by the Ambassador-rank Trade Rep resentative. When  agreement  cannot  be  reached on  an  issue  through  the  trade  policy structure, however, and Presidential  determination is required, the issue will go  before  the Cabinet Council on Commerce  and Trade. This council has also commis sioned a study of U.S. competitiveness  in  high technology industries. The remaining  councils are neither as involved in interna tional affairs nor as active overall.  SENIOR INTERAGENCY GROUP ON  INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY  To coordinate  foreign and  international  economic policies, a new Senior Interagency  Group on  International Economic Policy  <SIG-IEP> was set up  in  the summer of  1982. The need for this group was highlight ed by differences over such  issues as the  U.S. embargo of energy-related equipment  to the Soviet Union and frictions with the  European Common Market over exports of  subsidized agricultural products. To ensure  that domestic and  international economic  policies would be fully consistent and inte grated, the President's directive named the  Secretary of the Treasury as chairman of  the SIG-IEP in addition to his role as chair man pro tempore of the Cabinet Council on  Economic Affairs.  As originally proposed by the National Se curity Advisor, the SIG-IEP was to be set  up within the NSC system and chaired by  the Secretary of State with the Secretary of  the Treasury as vice chair. The SIG-IEP  was to funnel information on international  economic policy  issues  from other  inter agency bodies to the NSC, focus government  attention on  important  international eco nomic issues, and monitor the implementa tion of U.S. policies  in  international eco nomic affairs.  As finally set up, in a memo from Presi dent Reagan to the Cabinet of July 23, 1982,  the SIG-IEP took on a somewhat different  role. The objectives set out  in  the Presi dent's memo were to  ""<1> develop, review, and prepare alterna tives and recommendations on international  economic policy issues as they relate to for eign policy,  <2>  develop  a  comprehensive  international economic policy as it relates to  foreign policy, and <3> coordinate the prep arations for international economic summit  conferences.""  The latter objectives are much broader  and seemingly more substantive than those  originally envisioned. In addition, the Secre tary of the Treasury was given the chair manship rather than the Secretary of State,  who is the vice chairman. The SIG-IEP was  also given  the authority  to  form  its own  working group instead of using the existing  NSC structure, and  it established a mid level interagency support group chaired by  the Assistant Secretary of Treasury  for  International Affairs.  Membership of the SIG-IEP includes the  Secretaries  of  State, Agriculture,  Com merce, and Defense; Director of the Office  of Management and Budget; U.S. Trade  Representative; Chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisors; Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency; Assistant to the Presi dent for National Security Affairs; and As sistant to the President for Policy Develop ment; as well as the Secretary of the Treas ury. Other domestic officials with a seeming  interest  in  foreign and  international eco nomic  issues,  such  as  the Secretary  of  Labor, are not members.  In his role as chairman pro tempore of the  Cabinet  Council  on  Economic  Affairs  <CCEA>. the Secretary of the Treasury is to  provide leadership in the debates on inter national issues with major economic policy  implications and, as chairman of SIG-IEP,  to provide  leadership  in  the debates on  international economic  issues with major  foreign policy implications. The CCEA pro vides Treasury with a vehicle for presenting  analysis to the Cabinet, and the SIG-IEP  ",1983
926,1135,13,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  to bring to the attention of my  colleagues a  joint resolution adopted  by  the Maine Legislature expressing  the need  for  prompt  congressional  action to insure the solvency of the  railroad retirement system.  In 1981, Congress rescued the rail road  retirement  system  from bank ruptcy  by  enacting  a  compromise  funding plan  that was  expected  to  keep the system solvent for the next  10 years. However, the system is near  collapse once again because of the re cession which has caused a sharp, un expected loss of jobs in the railroad in dustry and a drop in payroll tax reve nues during the last 2 years. The prob lem has been exacerbated by the in creased number of claims for railroad  unemployment  benefits,  some  of  which have had to be drawn from the  retirement system.  If Congress does  not  take  remedial  action,  pension  benefits to retirees will be cut 40 per cent this fall and more in the fall of  1984.  Fortunately, rail labor and manage ment have devised a compromise plan  to rescue the retirement system. That  plan, embodied  in H.R. 1646 and S.  1074, would foster solvency by chang ing benefits,  increasing payroll  taxes  and providing  for certain borrowing  provisions.  H.R. 1646 has been reported by the  House Energy and Commerce Commit tee and recently ordered reported by  the House Ways and Means Commit tee. However,  no  action  has  been  taken  in the Senate yet other than  hearings  conducted  by  the Senate  Committee on Labor and Human Re sources.  Mr.  President,  the  leadership  of  both houses of the Maine Legislature  has acknowledged the dependency of  beneficiaries on  the  railroad  retire ment system and the critical need for  corrective action  to stave off bank ruptcy. I commend their expression of  concern  to my  colleagues  in  the  Senate and urge them to act expedi tiously on  the compromise  funding  plan.  Mr. President, I ask that the resolu tion be printed in the RECORD at this  point.  The resolution follows:  JOINT  RESOLUTION  MEMORIALIZING  THE  MAINE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO SUP PORT THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT SOLVENCY  ACT OF 1983  We, your Memorialists,  the Senate and  House of Representatives of  the State of  Maine in the First Regular Session of the  One Hundred  and Eleventh Legislature,  now assembled, most  respectfully present  and petition the Maine Congressional Dele gation as follows:  Whereas, many residents of the State of  Maine are currently engaged in railroad em ployment or have engaged in such employ ment in the past and look to the railroad retirement system to provide benefits when  they retire; and  Whereas, many residents of the State of  Maine  are  currently  receiving  benefits  under the railroad retirement system and  rely on such benefits to a  large extent to  meet the normal costs of living; and  Whereas, any reduction in the amount of  benefits received by beneficiaries under the  railroad  retirement system would have a  drastic affect on the ability of these benefi ciaries to meet normal living expenses; and  Whereas, projections of the financial con dition of  the  railroad  retirement  system  show that unless corrective action is taken,  monthly annuities will have to be reduced  significantly beginning with  the annuity  checks to be sent out October 1, 1983, with  additional reductions required in the future;  and  Whereas, House Resolution  1646,  the  Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983,  was introduced in the United States House  of Representatives on February 24, 1983, by  Mr. Florio; and  Whereas, House Resolution 1646 would re solve the short-term and long-term financial  problems of the railroad retirement system,  through an evenhanded approach of tax in creases on railroad employers and employ ees and adjustments of benefits to current  and future beneficiaries, thereby preserving  and protecting the rights and expectations  of  those currently  receiving benefits and  those who would  receive such benefits  in  the future; now, therefore, be it  Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, re spectfully urge that the members of Con gress  representing  the State  of Maine  should actively support and vote favorably  on House Resolution 1646, the Railroad Re tirement Solvency Act of 1983; and be it fur ther  Resolved: That suitable copies of this res olution be transmitted immediately to the  members of the Maine Congressional Dele gation.e  THE L-REACTOR AT THE SAVANNAH RIVER PLANT, AIKEN, S.C.  e ",1983
927,1135,13,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President, a  short while ago,  the  junior Senator  from South Carolina <Mr. HoLLINGS),  inserted for the REcoRD his interpreta tion of my amendment to the Energy  and Water Development Appropria tions Act of 1984 relating to the re start of the L-reactor at the Savannah  River Plant, Aiken, S.C.  I simply want to take this opportuni ty to say that my amendment is clear  and distinct in intent and purpose. It  mandates the Department of Energy  to successfully complete an environ mental impact statement and then to  live up to its commitment to the State  of South Carolina to conduct studies  and mitigate thermal effects upon is suance of a discharge permit. It should  not be construed to either enlarge or  diminish the rights of South Carolina  in dealing with DOE and issuance of  discharge permits in regard to the L reactor.e  ",1983

930,1148,13,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, I have  cleared on this side Calendar No. 246,  which is H.R. 1746. I inquire of the mi nority leader if he is in a position to  clear that item for action at this time,  as well as  the accompanying Budget  Act waiver, which is.

933,1148,13,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Without objection, it  is so ordered. The clerk will state the  resolution by title.  The assistant  legislative clerk read  as follows:  A Senate Resolution <S. Res. 157> waiving  section 402(a) of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974 with respect  to the consider ation of H.R. 1746.  ",1983
934,1148,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  question is on agreeing to the resolu tion.  The resolution <S. Res. 157) was con sidered and agreed to as follows:  S. RES. 157  Resolved. That pursuant to section 402<c>  of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,  the provisions of section 402<a> of such Act  are waived with respect to the consideration  of H.R. 1746. Such waiver is necessary be cause H.R. 1746 authorizes the enactment  of  new  budget  authority which would  become available  in  fiscal year 1983 and  such bill was not reported on or before May  15, 1982, as required by section 402<a> of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for such  authorizations. Such waiver  is also neces sary because H.R. 1746 authorizes the exer cise of new budget authority which would  become available  in  fiscal year 1984 and  such bill was not reported on or before May  15, 1983, as required in section 402<a> of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for such  authorizations.  The waiver of section 402<a>  is necessary  to permit the Navajo and Hopi Relocation  Commission to fulfill  its statutory mission  of implementing Public Law 93-531 <88 Stat.  1712).  H.R. 1746 provides an authorization  in crease  to $7,700,000  from  the preexisting  level of $5,500,000 for section 14 activities  under Public Law 93-531 <88 Stat. 1712), and  a new authorization of $15,000,000 for fiscal  year 1983  through 1987, for section 15 ac tivities under Public Law 93-531 <88 Stat.  1712).  The House Appropriations Subcommittee  on Interior has included funds in its fiscal  year 1984 markup  for  implementation of  these program activities. The sums provided  in the subcommittee markup are included in  the President's fiscal year 1984 budget re quest. The Appropriations Committees of  the Senate and the House of Representa tives have. therefore, had adequate notice of  this authorization. Thus, congressional con sideration of this authorization will  in no  way interfere with or delay the appropria tions process.  NAVAJO AND HOPI  INDIAN RE LOCATION  COMMISSION  AU THORIZATION  ",1983

939,1148,13,Mr. BAKER.," Mr.  President,  the  reason for that, I say to my friend, the  minority leader, is that one Senator on  this side had asked to be present on  the floor at the time of consideration  of this item. I should like to have him  advised that we are doing so at this  time.  THE CALENDAR  ",1983
940,1148,13,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President,  there  are three other items that are cleared  for action on  the Calendar at  this  time. I identify all three for the con sideration  of  the minority  leader.  They are Calendar Order Nos.  269, and 270. Is the minority leader in  a position to clear for action by unani mous consent all three or any of that  list of items?  ",1983

942,1148,13,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I sin cerely appreciate the leadership's co operation in bringing this measure to  the Senate floor in a  timely fashion.  In Public Law 97-113 the Congresses tablished a process whereby the con tinuation of U.S. military aid to El Sal vador was dependent upon certifica tion by the President every 6 months  that the Government of El Salvador  was making significant progress in sev eral important areas; namely, control  of its security forces, compliance with  internationally  recognized  human  rights,  implementation  of  economic  and political reforms and commitment  to elections,  including good faith ef forts  to  begin  discussions with  all  major political factions which have de clared their willingness to find and im plement an equitable political  solu tion. In addition, in the first certifica tion only, the President was required  to  include a section on the progress  being made  in  the  investigation of  the  murders  of  four  American  churchwomen and  two  land  reform  specialists. Obviously  the Congress  fully expected that these crimes would  be completely investigated and those  responsible brought to justice at the  earliest possible date.  In  retrospect,  Mr. President, we were unduly and un fortunately optimistic. Now, over 2%  years later, as we await the final Presi dential  certification  required  under  Public Law 97-113,  two more Ameri cans have been brutally murdered and  no one has been brought to justice for  these crimes. The bill we are consider ing today, H.R. 1271, seeks to insure  that a report on progress in the inves tigation of the murders of the Ameri cans remains an integral part of the  certification due on July 20. This bill  passed the House by a vote of 416 to 2  on June 7 and was approved yesterday  by the Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee without dissent. Further,  the  Foreign Relations Committee has rec ommended that the certification proc ess,  including permanently this item,  be extended for the fiscal year 1984.  One can easily understand the de spair and frustration of the families of  the murdered Americans. They have  ",1983

Mr. Chairman, it is  indeed a privi lege for me to once again present to  the House the annual District of Co lumbia appropriation bill.  The budget we present to the House  today will finance the District govern ment's operations during  fiscal year  1984, and is virtually untouched from  the one submitted by District officials  on April  committee  shifted only $553,000 between five dif ferent programs and agencies, and, in  addition, directed  that District offi cials provide adequate  funds  in  two  areas-streetlighting and traffic signal  costs, and reduction of the accumulat ed general  fund deficit. Sources of  funding for these latter two items are  left to the discretion of the Mayor and  council, who are  responsible  for ad justing  priorities  and making  sure  these obligations are properly funded.  So, Mr. Chairman, for all intents and  purposes, the budget that we present  at this time is the one that was pro posed and submitted by District offi cials back in April of this year.  1983. The  FEDERAL FUNDS  of $544,590,000  The committee recommends a  total  in Federal funds  for  the operation of the District of Colum bia government in fiscal year 1984 con sisting of:  A Federal payment of $361 million  which is  the same as the fiscal year  1983 level but $25 million below the re quest due to lack of authorizing legis lation;  A Federal contribution of $52 mil lion  to  the police, fire,  teachers and  judges pension fund;  A Federal  reimbursement of $16.5  million for water and sewer services  furnished to Federal facilities; and  Federal loans of $115 million for the  District's construction program.  The bill,  as  recommended by  the  committee,  is  consistent with  the  budget resolution which was adopted  by  the House and  the Senate  last  week.  DISTRICT FUNDS  We recommended a  total budget of  $2,122,013,000 from District revenues.  This amount is $123,171,100 above the  fiscal year 1983  level and consists of  $1,999,205,600 for operating expenses  and $122,807,400 for capital improve ment projects.  EMPLOYMENT LEVEL  Each year I have tried to keep the  members advised on the progress the  District government is making in re ducing its employment base. In fiscal  the year before I became  chairman, there were 39,105 positions  in  the District government.  In  this  bill,  the  committee  recommends  a  year 1980,  527  total of 31,913 positions which is a re duction of  positions below  the  fiscal year 1983 level and 7,192 or 18.4  percent below the number of positions  that were available in fiscal year 1980.  Mr. Chairman,  this  reduction has  come about through various manage ment  and  administrative  improve ments  initiated by District officials  who on  the one hand are  trying  to  streamline  the bureaucracy while at  the same time improve service deliv ery.  GOVERNMENTAL DIRECTION AND SUPPORT  18  The bill includes $44,352,400 for the  agencies  and  activities  funded  under the governmental direction and  support appropriation; 10 of the agen cies are  funded at  their  fiscal year  1983 level and have no increase what soever.  The  remaining  eight  have  modest  increases  basically  for  in creased pay costs. The committee rec ommends a total of $5,408,200 for the  Council of the District of Columbia,  the city's legislative body. This allow ance is $416,900 above the fiscal year  1983 level to cover within grade salary  increases, funding for the fiscal year  1984 pay adjustment, and underfund ed salary costs. An increase of $20,000  is provided for the D.C. Auditor to an nualize  three  positions  initially  ap proved last year. A  total of $472,100  will  be  available  for  that office  in  fiscal year 1984.  Mr. Chairman,  the committee con tinues to be concerned with the oper ation of the D.C. Board of Elections  and Ethics. We raised this issue with  the Mayor on the very first day of our  hearings, and we followed up with the  chairman of the elections board who  explained that although some perma nent corrective action has been initiat ed by the board, one of the significant  problems  stems  from  the  transient  nature of a large segment of the Dis trict's population and the inability to  purge the files on the basis of a mail  check. These problems are being ad dresed by the city council. The com mittee has requested the board to pro vide the committee with a comprehen sive  timetable and plan for assuring  permanent improvements to the voter  registration rolls. The committee rec ommends $2,468,700 and 41 positions  for the operation of the board in fiscal  year 1984. The  increase of $856,900  will cover  the costs associated with  two additional elections scheduled to  be held during the year.  We recommend $2,403,700 and seven  positions  for  the D.C. Retirement  Board which controls and manages the  retirement  funds  for  police officers  and firefighters, judges, and teachers.  The committee recommends continu ation of the arrangement whereby 25  percent of  the board's costs are  fi nanced  from general  fund  revenues  and 75 percent from retirement fund  earnings. The  committee notes  the  board's diligence in exercising its fiduciary responsibility under Public Law  96-122 which created the board and  set forth its responsibilities.  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION  The committee recommends a  total  of $56,603,000 for the departments and  agencies included in this appropriation  category. For the Office of Planning  and  Development,  we  recommend  $2,843,000 for fiscal year 1984, a net  decrease of $334,100 below the fiscal  year  appropriation  level. This  office, Mr. Chairman, is the District's  central planning office and is responsi ble for producing, monitoring and up dating the District's elements of the  comprehensive plan.  For the Department of Housing and  Community Development, the bill in 1983  cludes $19,376,500, of which $2,826,600  $1,778,700  will be used to provide down payment  assistance so that low income District  residents will be able to buy homes. In  addition, $2.5 million will provide for  the rehabilitation of 100 units and $1  million will be used to acquire proper ties for rehabilitation.  For the Housing Finance Agency. we  recommend  as  requested.  The primary function of this agency is  to increase the supply and lower the  cost of funds available for residential  mortgages and construction loans, and  in doing so, help alleviate the shortage  of affordable housing  for  the city's  low-and moderate-income residents.  The bill  includes $307,100  to  fully  fund eight positions for the Commis sion on  the Healing Arts Licensure.  Mr. Chairman, this is a revenue pro ducing activity responsible for approv ing or denying the licensure of appli cants to practice medicine and other  healing arts. Testimony was received  by the committee  to  the effect that  there  is a backlog  in all areas, and  with only four of the eight positions  filled,  the committee has urged  the  Commission to move ahead in filling  the four vacant positions and reducing  the backlog of cases.  For the Department of Finance and  Revenue,  the bill  includes  the  full  budget request of $15,976,200 which is  $1,136,100 above the fiscal year 1983  level. This Department expects to gen erate almost $1,3 billion  in revenues  for the operation of the District gov ernment in fiscal year 1984.  PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUSTICE  Under the public safety and justice  appropriation,  the committee  recom mends a total of $457,840,300 for fiscal  year 1984, an increase of $52,963,500  above the fiscal year 1983 level. The  committee  recommends  for  the Metropolitan Police Depart ment. At our first hearing this year,  the Mayor testified that 3,891 officers  were on board. As some of you will  recall, many Members  of Congress  were  concerned  that  the  city  not  reduce the level of uniformed officers,  and District officials have concurred  $139,820,900  ",1983
963,1213,13,Mr. SHELBY.," I would like to point  out one other thing. The Commission  itself did not ask for these personnel  management mandates. They did not  do  it, and  I do not  think  that we  should do that.  ",1983
964,1213,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Shelby substitute. This is perhaps  the most  important  consumer vote  facing the Members in this session. Ac cording to the recent Lou Harris poll,  the American public strongly supports  the Consumer Product Safety Com mission. In fact, almost half of those  surveyed wanted to strengthen CPSC,  and  an  overwhelming  88  percent  wanted the agency to provide greater  safety for children's toys.  The committee bill, H.R. 2668,  re sponds  to  this  public  demand  for  greater product safety by giving CPSC  adequate funding, staff and authority  to protect the public. The Shelby sub stitute cuts the funding in the commit tee bill by over $60 million. It offers no  protection against further staff cuts,  makes no regulatory reforms, does not  provide greater toy safety and contin ues the gag on the agency when infor mation  is  requested under  the Free dom of Information Act.  The Shelby substitute should be re jected because it is anticonsumer, anti CPSC, and anti-industry.  Let me explain why  I make  this  charge. First,  the Shelby substitute  cuts the funding levels in the commit tee bill by over $60 million. H.R. 2668  adopted a level of funding equivalent  to what the agency had in fiscal year  1981, because that is  the amount of  money the agency needs to protect the  public  against  dangerous  products.  The budget cuts imposed upon CPSC  since fiscal year 1981 have drastically  reduced product safety in the market place. Agency  inspections  have  de creased by 44 percent;  recall checks  are down 64  percent;  investigations  have dropped by 14 percent. The cuts  have also forced the agency to delay  many important safety activities.  For example, CPSC was  forced  to  postpone research needed to upgrade a  30-year-old flammability standard for  wearing apparel because they did not  have the funds  to do  it. Even public  education and  information activities  have  been  severely  curtailed. The  agency had  to decline  invitations  to  make information available about haz ardous products because they did not  have enough funds. They had to shift  their funding 5ack and forth simply to  stay alive.  The Shelby substitute does nothing  to redress  this lack of safety in the  marketplace. It merely perpetuates an  already bad situation.  The Shelby substitute extends  the  agency for 3 years. We have tried to  give it a longer period of time so that  they could make  important manage ment decisions.  The Shelby substitute does not pro tect CPSC from further crippling staff  cuts.  The General Accounting Office re ports that the agency has lost 32 per cent of  its  technical  and  scientific  staff. How can this agency protect the  public if it has lost 32 percent of the  scientific staff to advise  them about  hazards in consumer products? Rather  than replace this lost technical talent,  OMB has proposed even deeper staff  cuts.  Industry recognizes that these staff  cuts mean that CPSC cannot protect  the public from dangerous products.  For example, under the current law,  companies are required  to  tell CPSC  when one  of  their products has  a  defect  which  poses  a  substantial  hazard to the public. This is so CPSC  can work with the industry to develop  a voluntary standard  to correct  the  problem. But  the  reports  to  the  agency have dropped by 52 percent.  Companies  apparently  realize  that  cuts in the agency's field staff make it  unlikely that they will ever find out  about these dangerous products.  The cuts in staff also hurt the indus try. When the good name of a product  is called  into question, we ought  to  have a CPSC that can investigate the  allegations and resolve the issue quick ly and correctly. Denying the agency  adequate  technical  staff prevents  it  from making  these  fast  determina tions. It also increases the possibility  of error, and this ill serves the busi ness community, as well as  the con sumer.  Fourth, the Shelby substitute simply  eliminates many of the rulemaking re forms in H.R. 2668. It strikes the pro vision in H.R. 2668 which allows the  agency to recall dangerously defective  toys.  Under current  law, some manufac turers must advise  the agency when  one of their products  is dangerously  defective. But this provision does not  apply to most toymakers. While great er toy safety is supported by 88 per cent of  the American people,  in  a  recent Lou Harris survey, the Shelby  substitute drops  this provision  that  would lead to greater toy safety.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  California  <Mr.  WAXMAN) has expired.  <By  unanimous  consent,  Mr.  WAXMAN was allowed to proceed for 5  additional minutes.)  ",1983
965,1213,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," The Shelby substi tute further strikes the provision  in  H.R. 2668  that permits the Commis sioners of the agency to write opinions  of  agency's actions without getting  clearance  from  industry.  Can  you  imagine that? The Consumer Product  Safety Commission, if it wants to give  out information in its files, it has to go  to industry and ask them if it is OK.  Industry quite often,  as you might  expect, will say, ""No, I do not want the  public to know about these complaints  about dangerous products until you  have gone through a very exhaustive  procedure."" After that period of time,  which could  involve months,  if not  years, I do not know how many addi tional consumers may be  injured be cause the public is not even informed  that there is product that is causing  injuries or at least from which many  people have been injured.  The Shelby substitute  strikes  the  provision  in H.R. 2668  that permits  the Commissioners to write their opin ions. It strikes  the provisions which  permit the agency  to respond to re quests for information under the Free dom of Information Act in the same  manner as  every other health and  safety agency. We are not changing  the law to give the CPSC any different  standing but to bring it in par with  every other health and safety agency  in the Federal Government under the  Freedom of Information Act.  H.R. 2668 makes a modest change to  permit the agency to release informa tion other than confidential or trade  secret information. That is still being  protected.  Mr. Chairman, the American public  expects greater product safety. H.R.  2668  responds  to  that  demand  by  giving  the agency adequate  funding  and staffing and authority.  The Shelby substitute does not. It  maintains the budget and staff cuts  that have caused a decline in product  safety. It does not ease the regulatory  burdens on industry, it does not pro vide greater safety regarding toys, as  demanded by an overwhelming majori ty of the public.  I urge all of my colleagues to sup port the bill and to reject the Shelby  substitute for the sake of consumers  and of industry.  ",1983
966,1213,13,Mr. BROYHILL.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
967,1226,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," Or a standard which  prevents hundreds of child deaths and  thousands of poisonings  each  year;  while consumers are put at risk under  this Levitas proposal, so  is  industry.  The probable  effect of  that effect  upon judicial review is most troubling.  Under current law agency rules must  be promulgated in accordance with de tailed procedures and  supported by  substantial evidence. However, under  the Levitas proposal  any defect  in  agency procedures or lack of evidence  to support the rule may be cured by  congressional affirmation of the rule.  Thus,  the Levitas  amendment may  deny an industry a meaningful judicial  review  of  that  rule.  Finally,  the  amendment to the amendment in the  nature of a  substitute permits Con gress  to  control  the  administrative  process without stripping CPSC of its  rule-making  authority. The Levitas  amendment,  however,  turns  CPSC  into little more than a study commission. They could study all these prob lems, they could come up with regula tions and then Congress could act the  same as we could now without  this  proposal before us.  I  know we  are  hard-pressed to think of an alternative  to the legislative veto. I think this is a  reasonable  alternative.  I  think  it  allows us to exercise our oversight ju risdiction in a way that would prevent  the excesses that we saw which led to  the adoption of the legislative veto. I  would urge my colleagues to support  the amendment to the amendment in  the nature of a substitute as a valid  means of controlling  the  legislative  process and urge  them to reject the  Levitas amendment if offered.  ",1983
968,1226,13,Mr.  LEVITAS.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I personally have no  objection to this committee adopting  the Waxman amendment. I think the  substitute, and the bill, are improved  with this amendment.  However, this amendment is simply  a good first step; but for reasons that I  will point out in a moment, it does not  go far enough.  It is certainly better than a poke in  the eye with a sharp stick, but it still  is not really the best solution to deal ing with this problem.  Let me expain why  it  is not: The  Waxman  amendment  provides  that  CPSC rules could be disapproved by  the enactment of a joint resolution-a  resolution of disapproval  passed  by  both Houses of Congress and signed  by the President-within 90 days after  referral of the rule  to the Congress.  This is a step in the right direction. It  is a so-called form of legislative veto.  But there is a problem with the ap proach.  The problem is  that the resolution  of disapproval which a Member of this  body might  introduce would be  re ferred to the subcommittee chaired by  the gentleman  from California, and  there is a strong likelihood that if the  gentleman  from California  liked  the  rule, and did not like the resolution of  disapproval,  this House would never  even have the opportunity of express ing itself on the matter.  That is the inherent weakness. As I  say, it is better than nothing. But it  would  in  fact  leave  to  the  distin guished  gentleman  from California,  whom I  respect and whom  I admire  greatly, the decision as to whether or  not the rule should go forward or not  go forward. And it seems to me that  what we are looking for in trying to re establish this balance is a mechanism  that would  do what  the Supreme  Court, in effect, said, and that is pro vide that Congress should act through  legislation.  The amendment which I will be of fering takes the first cut that the gen tleman from California has made with  his amendment, but my amendment  carries it a step further. My amend ment offers a better procedure by as suming  that  the Members  of  this  House have an opportunity to express  themselves on whether or not the rule  should go forward.  Let me deal with two specific points  that  the gentleman  from California  has alluded to as problems with my  amendment.  The first is he said there would be  delay in seeing some of the good rules  come  forward. Now,  I have been  in  this House long enough to know that  when this House wants to move expe ditiously on  important matters, bills  can be introduced in the morning and  be passed by sundown.  In this instance the resolution of ap proval of a regulation from the CPSC  would be assigned  to the Committee  on Energy and Commerce, turned over  to Mr. WAXMAN's subcommittee and if  he thought it was a good rule, I have  no doubt that we would see it come  flying out of that committee in very  short order and the House would be  able  to work  its will, again  in very  short order, as was done, for example,  in  the  saccharin  situation  several  years ago.  So,  the  fear  that  there would be  delays, I  think, is really a false fear,  because it would not happen. The gen tleman from California would call the  shots about timing and we would have  plenty of opportunity  to act expedi tiously on it.  The gentleman from California also  expressed  concern  about  Congress  having to approve masses of rules. But  that fear is also unfounded in the case  of the CPSC which we are considering  today.  I am not suggesting that the proce dure  I  am proposing  today  should  apply in all cases of rulemaking by all  agencies;  indeed, there are many rea sons why  it should not apply  in all  cases. But in the instance of the Con sumer  Product  Safety  Commission  this procedure would work. I think it  is very important to realize that the  CPSC which is to be authorized for 5  years under the bill we are consider ing, and for 3 years under the substi tute, has been given very broad au thority.  And  this authority was delegated  with a legislative veto in place.  If now the legislative veto does not  exist and  the broad delegation does,  we have then the worst of both possi ble worlds. In the 10 years of the exist ence of the Consumer Product Safety  Commission, they have only issued 35  mandatory rules. So, we are not talk ing about a mass of rules to be consid ered. Three a year  is what you are  looking at on the average if they con tinue at the same pace.  The Waxman amendment is a step  forward and for that reason I urge its  adoption. but when action on it is com",1983

Upon our  adjournment  today, we  will adjourn to convene at 10 o'clock  tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow  the House will  take up,  first of all, a resolution relating to an  investigation  by  the Committee on  Standards of Official Conduct.

974,1252,13,Mr. LEVIT AS., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from North Caroli na.  ,1983
975,1252,13,Mr. BROYHILL.," I thank the gentle man for yielding again.  Mr. Speaker,  the gentleman  com mented, of course, on  the fact  that  when the Court made its decision,  it  also had the effect probably of repeal ing the Budget and Impoundment Act,  which means that the President may  be able to impound funds.  That does raise an interesting ques tion. There may be some of us,  the  budget cutters and others, who are for  that, but on the other hand,  it cuts  both ways. Congress has passed these  programs,  they  have  appropriated  funds  to fund  the various programs,  and it may not be the intent of Con gress to cut moneys in that area.  We do know, of course, that in some  State  legislatures  the Governors are  given  item vetoes; however,  in  those  cases there is at least a  response by  the  legislative branch  to  that  item  veto which is not available in the case  of impoundment.  So it may be that we need to take a  look at this whole area of the powers  of the President to impound funds.  ",1983
976,1252,13,Mr. LEVIT AS.," The gentleman is ab solutely correct, and perhaps as we  have this conference on the sharing of  power and  take a  look at a possible  constitutional amendment, there may  be some tradeoff between a  line-item  veto on the one hand and a legislative  veto on the other hand.  We get back  to  the  fundamental  question about  this whole question,  and that is a question that we ought  to ask ourselves and our constituents  ought to ask us: Who makes the laws  in this country? Is it the elected Mem bers of Congress who are accountable  to the American people, or is it the un elected bureaucracy? I think that the  Supreme Court at this point has said  it is mostly the unelected bureaucracy  and our responsibility is to get back to  the Constitution and make sure it is  the people who elect the representa tives in this Republic.

978,1252,13,Mr. LEVITAS., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1983
979,1252,13,Mr. PASHAYAN.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr.  Speaker,  as  the  gentleman  knows, I love rules and procedure and  I spent some considerable time study ing  this version of  rules and proce dure, the legislative veto, but from the  historical  point  of  view  and  this  device,  the  legislative  veto,  can  be  traced to our early Congresses.  In discussions between  the gentle man and I, I think I pointed out to the  gentleman, and I appreciate his recall ing it earlier in his remarks,  that in  1804, for example, the Congress passed  a  legislative veto provision, and that  was  in emulation of British statutes  the  Parliament  had  been  using  throughout the 18th century, the cen tury  in which our Constitution was  written.  Surely the framers of our Constitu tion and our Founding Fathers in the  early Congresses were aware that Par liament for centuries had been dele gating the authority to various execu tive agencies or officials to issue rules  and regulations, and Parliament had  developed a scheme by which proce durally they could manage the produc tion of these rules and regulations by  a parliamentary device. In England it  is called the Lane procedure, and here  we  call  it  the  legislative veto. Our  early Congresses did it. It was part of  what the Congress and the framers as sumed  that  legislative power meant  when they vested, in writing the Con stitution, all  the  legislative power in  the Congress of the United States. It  is one of  the  things  the Legislature  did,  the Legislature  being modeled  principally after Parliament. That had  been done  for centuries. It was not  that big a thing, really.  But  historically,  it has  been  the  entire Legislature  that has enjoyed  the right, and not one of the Houses  independently. Of course,  in submit ting  the  amicae  brief,  one  of  the  points we hope the Court will decide  on in the Chadha case is that it was a  one-House veto. That one-House veto  might well not be constitutional be cause there is no historical precedent  for it. There is ample historical prece dent for the entire Legislature, wheth er Parliament or Congress, exercising  the  right  to manage  these  informal  kinds of laws which, of course, rules  and regulations are because they are  not described  in  the Constitution at  all.  In that sense, in this country, Con gress is really acting not in a constitu tional capacity, which it acts in when  we pass statutes here. That is a consti tutional capacity. Really,  the legisla tive veto permits Congress to act in a  statutory capacity, just as the issuing  of rules and regulations is a statutory  and not a constitutional law.  ",1983
980,1252,13,Mr. LEVITAS.,"  I  thank the gentle man  for  his  historical  perspective,  which I hope will be persuasive to the  Court.  In conclusion,  let me say this, Mr.  Speaker: Several days ago, after the  Court's decision, and we began to rela lize the impact of this upon the Con gress, I remember having a conversa tion with a colleague of ours who has  generally opposed our efforts at legis lative veto over rules and regulations.  He at first blush was rather pleased  with the Court's decision; if not with  the logic, at least with the result.  I said to him in the course of our  r know how you  conversation,  feel  about rules and regulations. You like  them. Therefore, you do not like to see  them vetoed. But by  the  time you  come back from  the Fourth of July  district  work  period,  under  this  Court's decision, the President of the  United States could have  taken  the  following action without any  legisla tive  rejection procedure which now  exists, or used to exist.""  I said, ""By the time you come back  to Washington,  the President of the  United States  could  have  deployed  troops in El Salvador, he could have  sold F-16's to Jordan, and he could  have impounded all the money in the  jobs bill,"" all  three of which would  have caused some discomfort  to our  colleague and his constituency.  Whereupon, he suggested, after re flection,  that perhaps we needed  to  pass a 6-month moratorium on the ex ercise by  the executive agencies and  the President and the other agencies  of any of the delegated powers until  we have decided which ones we want  to take away and which ones we want  to restructure, which sort of brings it  ",1983

983,1278,13,Mr. BARNES.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  Reagan  administration  talks  a  lot  about democracy, but when the chips  are down it does not do much about it.  The three struggling Andean democ racies of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador  have been hit by 6 months of flooding  and drought which have caused more  than $1 billion of damage. Five million  people have lost their jobs, their crops,  their homes-or their lives-as a result  of these disasters.  In Bolivia, a quarter of the popula tion  has  gone without  rain  for  8  months. One town of 100,000 people is  without water. Seventy percent of the  wheat and potato crop has been lost.  In Peru and Ecuador, 12 feet of rain  has fallen  in traditionally dry areas.  Floods and mud slides have destroyed  homes,  roads, and bridges,  isolating  many  towns  for months. Unemployment is as high as 70 percent. Child  mortality is up 300 percent.  What has our response been? Less  than $55 million  in Public Law 480  food  assistance. Aside  from  that nothing. AID is asking for the piddling  sum of $100 million in disaster assist ance for this region. OMB says it can not find the money. But yesterday it  found a spare billion dollars for the B1 bomber.  The Dominican Republic,  one  of  those  Caribbean  democracies  the  President is always saying he wants to  defend, needs $200 million  in credits  by the end of this month  to meet a  short-term balance-of-payments short fall  that would place  the Domincan  Republic out of compliance with  its  IMF agreements. To help meet  this  immediate need,  the Dominican Re public has requested of us $60 million  in CCC credits-not a gift, but a loan.  USDA and OMB could care less, and  the White House does nothing.  Mr. Speaker,  these are cases-and  they are not  the only ones-where  timely  infusions  of  relatively  small  amounts of money can significantly  buttress  the  stability  of  friendly.  democratic regimes. Why do we not  care? When will  the President put  some modest resources where his rhet oric is?  I  include pertinent briefing papers  at this point:  NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE ANDEAN  COUNTRIES  The  three Andean democracies of Peru.  Bolivia and Ecuador. already facing serious  economic and financial problems. now have  been buffeted by an unprecedented series of  natural disasters that have further damaged  their  economies  and  caused widespread  human suffering. What  is particularly un usual about  these disasters  is  their recur ring, virtually non-stop nature.  All  three countries have been hit by tor rential rains and flooding-and this has con tinued over  the past six months. At  the  same  time.  this  inversion of  the weather  pattern has caused a large portion of the al tiplano region of Southern Peru and Bolivia  to experience a prolonged drought which  has brought this already poor area to the  brink of  famine. These people. who have  suffered for the past six months. expressed  feelings of anguish and despair at what was  happening  to  them, and  to  their families.  homes and sources of income.  AGGREGATE DAMAGE ESTIMATES AND U.S.  ASSISTANCE  The damages to date are estimated con servatively at about $300 million in Ecuador.  $350 million in Bolivia and $750 million in  Peru. A total of nearly 5 million people have  been severely affected through loss of jobs,  crops, homes and lives. A large portion of  the agriculture areas of the countries has  been devastated. Coming on top of the eco nomic and  financial crisis  these countries  are experiencing, the effects of these con tinuing natural disasters threaten the sta bility of democracy  in  the Andean  sub region.  U.S. disaster assistance to date totals less  than $55 million,  the bulk of which  is  in  Public Law 480 food assistance.  EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT  In the drought area, farmers were forced  to slaughter their livestock due to  lack of  pasture. The price of meat in Puna, Peru,  has  fallen  to $.25/pound-one quarter of  the Lima market price. Vegetables are  in  short supply  and  expensive. The potato  crop, the staple of the altiplano areas of Bo livia and Peru, came up  the size of mar bles-one-third of which were worm-infested  due to lack of resources to buy insecticides.  A  large proportion of the potato crop did  not even come up. To survive, families have  been forced to eat their seed potatoes.  Significant  out-migration  from  the  drought areas has taken place in both Peru  and Bolivia. Others have sent their children  to live in other parts of the country. Daily  trains down  to Arequipa, Peru from Puna  are  so crowded by migrating campesinos  that an extra train had to be added to the  schedule.  In Bolivia, more than 1.6 million people  have gone without  rain  for almost eight  months. That represents one-fourth of this  country's total population. That would be  the equivalent of 55-60 million in this coun try. The area affected  is  larger  than  the  state of Texas. The people hardest hit have  incomes as low as in Bangladesh.  The mining town of Potosi, with 100,000  people living at 14,000 feet above sea level,  has exhausted its water supplies. and must  haul water 40 km by railroad tank cars daily  to survive.  The people of Potosi and  the outlying  rural areas expressed  feelings of anguish,  frustration and anger-anger at the Bolivi an Government which they unfairly blame  for not providing them relief from their suf fering. On the Peruvian side of Lake Titica ca.  the  local  campesino  associations  and  workers in the Department of Puna staged a  two-day general strike  to dramatize  their  situation to the Peruvian Government. In a  special  report  in  the  Peruvian  press,  drought conditions around Puna were char acterized as ""the horror of the slow death.""  In Bolivia. crop projections for 1983 indi cate that the country faces an immediate  and serious food shortage due to major crop  losses caused by the drought conditions in  the altiplano and valley regions. and floods  in the Santa Cruz agricultural zone. Losses  of 70 percent of the potato and wheat crop  have occurred  in  the Bolivian highlands.  The deficit  in  the harvest of major  food  crops in both the altiplano and Santa Cruz  is estimated  to be over one million  tons.  This will require an additional $170 million  in food imports at a time when the country  is experiencing a very severe balance of pay ments shortfall. The economic  impact of  the loss of the 1982-83 harvests in terms of  lost income to the Bolivian farmers is equiv alent to more than $200 million. Industries  that depend on agricultural products are  being  forced  to close, pushing unemploy ment in Bolivia to alarming proportions.  Health conditions  in drought areas have  worsened due  to consumption of contami nated water. Gastro-enteric diseases have  increased dramatically.  EFFECTS OF THE FLOODS  In the flooded low land areas of Peru and  Ecuador,  the damage has been extensive  and  devastating.  In  the North of Peru,  flooding mud  flows  and  landslides  have  damaged many  roads,  isolating cities and  towns for over four months. Piura, Peru's  largest and most productive  farm  region,  has been devastated. Unemployment in this  department of 1.1 million people is estimat",1983
984,1304,13,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  honored and proud to be asked to par ticipate in the Congressional Call to  Conscience Vigil  for Soviet Jewry.  I  also wish to take this opportunity to  express my  thanks  to  the  distin guished gentleman from Colorado, Mr.  WIRTH,  for organizing  this effort  to  comment on  the  flagrant denial of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  June 29, 1983  rights  in  the Soviet  basic  human  Union.  Mr. Speaker, conditions have wors ened  for  those of  the Jewish  faith  living  in  the Soviet Union. Their  rights are becoming more  restricted  and the human damage that accompa nies this denial of freedom intensifies.  Evidence of this hostile environment  for rights and freedoms was brought  to my personal attention by a business  leader from my district whose son vis ited Benjamin  and Tatyana Bogo molny  less  than  2 weeks  ago  in  Moscow.  At the time of the visit, Benjamin  had been hospitalized  for a  serious  stomach ailment directly attributable  to the strain he has experienced over  the past 12 years since first applying  for an emigration visa. Tatyana was  released that same week after a 3-week  stay in Moscow sanitarium for severe  mental depression. She has painfully  shared her husband's disappointments  and turmoil.  Mr. Speaker, Benjamin and Tatyana  Bogomolny  are  young  by Western  standards: they are in their mid-thir ties, but the ravages of Soviet harass ment have aged them. Since their first  application  to  emigrate  they  have  become frail, sick, and distraught.  In the late 1960's Benjamin was con scripted into the Soviet Army while in  computer school. During this time his  sisters and parents were granted a visa  and they now live in Israel. Tatyana's  family was also given permission  to  leave  to go  to  Israel. Shortly after  their  departure, Benjamin was  re leased from the Army and he and Ta tyana were married.  In  1972  they  began their first of over 15 applica tions to emigrate to Israel to be with  their families, all which  resulted  in  cruel denials.  Mr. Speaker, with these denials also  came reprisals affecting the Bogomol nys' capacity to earn a livelihood. The  Soviet Government would not let Ben jamin return to computer school after  his first application to emigrate. He  now earns what he can-between ill nesses and hospitalizations-by doing  odd jobs, working as a handyman. For  the same reasons, Tatyana, trained as  translator, has been officially denied a  permanent job. She, too, finds but epi sodic  employment,  her  professional  training a casualty of her husband's  and her belief in Judaism and their  desire to join their families in Israel.  Some Soviet Jews who are denied  both exit visas and a permanent job  manage to survive on the shared pen sions of friends and relatives. But the  Bogomolnys are not even that fortu nate, Mr. Speaker. The two are alone,  isolated  in a country  that does not  want or need them, yet refuses to un chain them from their unlivable situa tion.  In recent years the KGB has mount ed an active campaign to add to Benjamin and Tatyana's misery. This cam paign has been effective:  the health  and  living conditions of  this couple  have deteriorated painfully. Many let ters and packages sent by their fami lies have, of course, failed  to arrive.  Their apartment has been ransacked  several times, subjecting them to the  theft of their personal possessions in cluding religious books and family pic tures and mementos. The KGB has  also questioned Benjamin for his  in terest in Jewish books and lectures.  Mr. Speaker, the most recent viola tion of these two peoples' privacy took  place in mid-April of this year when  their home was once again broken into  and ramsacked. The result was over whelming:  this was  the  reason  for  which Benjamin had to be hospital ized for 5 weeks and Tatyana lapsed  into a deep mental depression which  led  to  her  being  committed  to  a  Moscow sanitarium for 3 weeks. Mr.  Speaker,  colleagues, what has hap pended to the Bogomolnys is an un equivocal  example  of  the  Soviet's  stepped up campaign to wage psycho logical warfare against Soviet Jews.  On June 6 Soviet officials asserted  that  family  reunification of Soviet  Jews was complete. The Government  declared  that  the vast majority of  Soviet Jews who wished  to emigrate  had already received permission to do  so. I challenge these assertions.  As of June 15, neither Benjamin nor  Tatyana had been given permission to  reunite with relatives in Israel.  I call on my fellow Members of Con gress to continue to speak out against  these violations of human dignity. My  vigil continues until  the persecution  ends. My conscience will not rest until  freedom is granted to the Bogomolnys  and  the  thousands of others denied  rights to their religious beliefs and the  fundamental right to live in the pur suit of happiness.e  INTRODUCTION  OF  LEGISLA TION  INITIATING  HELEN  KELLER DEAF-BLIND AWARE NESS WEEK  HON.

On July 3,  the class of 1973 of  the Glen Cove  High School will gather to celebrate  its 10-year class reunion. I would like  to express my appreciation to Frank  Venturino and John Alexander,  co chairmen of the reunion 1973 commit tee  for making  this  important and  memorable occasion possible.  In light of recent reports of a ""rising  tide of mediocrity""  in public educa tion, it is particularly fitting that the  class of 1973 has reconvened to cele brate and remember the remarkable  educational experience they received.  This occasion serves not only to recog nize the excellent level of instruction  provided by the staff of the Glen Cove  school system, but to reaffirm those  friendships and  ties forged 10 years  ago.  By remembering the special educa tional experience which they were af forded a decade ago, the class of 1973  holds open the possibility that quality  education will once again be restored  in this Nation. The accomplishments  of the graduates of Glen Cove High  School represent an important exam ple for their own children and for the  thousands of future graduates of the  Glen Cove school system.  Let us not forget the importance of  maintaining and rekindling the bonds  of  friendship  which  were  forged  among  the graduates 10  years ago.  Many of the alumni of the class of  1973 have traveled hundreds of miles  to attend this reunion. If this occasion  serves  to  reaffirm  the  cooperative  working spirit embodied in the class of  1973,  the trip will have been worth while.  Mr. Speaker,  I salute  the class of  1973 on this special occasion and wish  them continued happiness and success.  I commend the staff of the Glen Cove  school system which made this collec tive experience possible. And I thank  Mr. Venturino and Mr. Alexander once  again for making this event a reality .e  THE 36TH ANNIVERSARY OF  WKOX  HON.

I take this opportunity to commend  WKOX and its first-rate staff for its  welcome contribution to the WKOX  listening audience. Radio stations such  as this one have become bulwarks in  the community and, on occasions such  as this, are deserving of the kind of  special  recognition  that mention  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  affords  them.

THE CONGRESSIONAL  FELLOW SHIP PROGRAM OF THE AMER ICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE AS SOCIATION <APSA)  HON. JAMES R. JONES  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 1983   ",1983
988,1317,13,Mr.  JONES  of  Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, on this the 30th anniversary  of the Congressional Fellowship Pro gram of  the American Political Sci ence Association, I would like to recog nize the important contributions this  program has made  to  the Congress  and to the American people.  APSA began  this program  in 1953  with six fellows. The program has ex panded to currently include almost 50  men and women each year. In addition  to American political  scientists,  the  fellows include political scientists from  West Germany and Southeast Asia,  Federal executives, journalists, and six  Robert Wood  Johnson  Foundation  health policy  fellows  selected  from  academic health centers in the United  States.  The health policy  fellowship  has  been part of the APSA program for 10  years. The fellows have worked as leg islative  aids,  special  assistants  on  health matters, and as staff members  of the health committees and subcom. mittees in both the House and Senate  where  they have had a  significant  impact on health policy and  legisla tion.  I have been fortunate to participate  in the program during the 93d, 96th,  and 98th Congresses. The fellows pro vide expertise in their areas of interest  which would not otherwise be avail able  to a congressional office. Upon  completion of the year on Capitol Hill,  which often  includes  experience  in  both the House and Senate, the fel lows return to their previous employ ment where  their understanding of  18257  the political process becomes integrat ed and disseminated, with a kind of  ripple effect, among their colleagues.  This knowledge of  the workings of  government  clearly  enhances  their  future participation in the democratic  process.  Many of the fellows have later re turned to public service as government  officials  and Members of Congress.  While this is not the goal of the pro gram, it is an indication of the mutual  value  and  cross-stimulation  which  often  results  from  exposure  to  the  Congress.  I encourage my colleagues  to take advantage of the opportunity  to enrich their office staffs by partici pation in the APSA congressional fel lowship program, as I have done, and  wish  the program well on  its 30th  birthday.e  EDUCATION AMENDMENTS  HON. BILL GREEN    OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 1983  e ",1983
989,1317,13,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker, in 1972,  Congress passed title IX of the educa tion amendments prohibiting sex dis crimination  in  education  programs.  Title IX covers virtually all areas of  student life: admissions, financial aid,  academic programs, health  services,  extracurricular activities, testing, and  counseling. Schools at all  levels are  covered from preschools  to graduate  schools. The legislative intent of Con gress was to remedy the gender-based  disparities  in opportunities available  to students. It is a law that has made a  difference. Prior to 1972, females were  reluctant  to enter vocational educa tion programs despite  the fact  that  such training led to high-paying jobs.  By 1980, the percentage of female stu dents in federally funded agriculture,  technical,  trade, and  industrial pro grams had  risen  from 8 percent  in  1972  to  30  percent. The  academic  world has also seen significantly  in creased numbers of women continuing  their  education  and  obtaining  ad vanced  degrees.  In  1980,  women  earned half of all the masters degrees  awarded.  Now  title  IX  is being  threatened.  The scope of its applicability is slowly  being  reduced  and diluted. Though  legislation  interpreting  title  IX  to  mean that compliance can be program  specific has not been reintroduced in  this Congress, there have been several  court rulings narrowing  the applica tion of title IX in the same manner. In  the past 2 years, two courts have inter preted the Supreme Court decision of  1974  involving title IX to mean that  the ban on discrimination applies only  to specific programs in universities re ceiving Federal aid, rather than to the  entire institution if any part of it re",1983
990,1330,13,Mr.  FLORIO.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  Energy and Commerce Committee has  before it H.R. 100, the Non-Discrimi nation in Insurance Act. This legisla tion would eliminate discrimination in  insurance on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, and national origin. It  does in insurance what has been done  in many other areas.  The insurance industry has decided  to oppose  this  legislation. Although  they first claimed that the legislation  would endanger  their solvency,  sug gested compromises have eliminated  any adverse financial impact on the in dustry.  The industry now claims that they  oppose  the  legislation because  they  are protecting  their women  policy holders. As part of their multimillion dollar campaign to defeat this legisla tion, companies have begun a series of  mailings to their stockholders and pol icyholders claiming that the bill will  cost women money.  The letter which follows shows the  tactics of the industry. It tells women  that their rates will go up if the bill  passes. The facts do not support the  claim. The GAO has confirmed that  when other factors are substituted for  sex there is little or no change in the  rates paid by women or men. Instead  of immutable characteristics like sex,  the industry would be forced to rely  on valid statistics like miles driven or  accident records. I  inserted the GAO  report in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on April 21, 1983, at page E1797.  The  experience  in  several States  which  have  required  unisex  rates  bears out  the  fact  that  rates  for  women do not increase when discrimi nation is outlawed. Instead, the insur ance  companies  rely  on  statistics  which look at the individual character istics of the insured, such as health,  smoking, or driving record,  to deter mine rates.  I do not believe that the campaign  of distortion being waged by the insur ance industry will succeed. The princi ple of eliminating discrimination is an  important one, and when the facts are  discussed it is clear that discrimination  can be eliminated without  the dire  consequences suggested by the indus try.  I  also  include a  recent article by  Jane Bryant Quinn from the July 4,  AETNA PERSONAL FINANCIAL  SECURITY DIVISION,  Hartford, Conn., June 1983.  DEAR AETNA  INsuRED: The cost of your  auto insurance and premiums for life insur ance purchases will increase dramatically if  legislation now before Congress is enacted.  Unless you and thousands of others act  immediately,  legislation  now  pending  in  Congress will become law-and, as a result,  you will pay unfairly higher auto and life  insurance premiums.  House Bill 100 and Senate Bill 372 would  force  insurers like Aetna to disregard the  simple  fact  that women as a group  live  longer than men ... or that female drivers  have fewer accidents than male drivers. We  would be required by law to ignore statistics  that prove you as a woman deserve lower  rates than men on these coverages. These  bills  somehow  consider  such  statistically  proven distinctions  to be unfair sex ""dis crimination.""  We believe not considering  these differ ences in setting insurance prices is unfair  economic discrimination. For example,  if  these bills pass:  Costs of auto and  life  insurance would  shift dramatically: women would pay more  so that men could pay less;  Women insured by Aetna would pay from  11 percent to 55 percent more for auto in surance every year, depending upon their  driver category and where they live;  Life insurance premiums for most women  insured by Aetna will go up-10 to 25 per cent;  In total women will pay $700 million more  for auto insurance and $360 million more  for life insurance, according to a study by  the American Academy of Actuaries.  Those who support these measures claim  that women will benefit in the area of pen sions. The truth is, it is not clear who will  benefit  in  the pension area:  in some  in stances men will;  in others women will.  Overall, however, women will pay more for  the insurance they buy as individuals than  they will gain in benefits from other types  of insurance and pensions. Over the course  of your lifetime, a ""typical"" insurance pack age  of  individual  coverages  from Aetna  could cost you up to $5,600 more than you  now payif this legislation is not stopped.  Aetna strongly believes that all forms of  unfair discrimination should be eliminated.  We think the use of sex as a rating factor in  insurance, however, is not unfair discrimina tion-nor  is  it really a  civil  rights  issue.  These distinctions are based on valid statis tics upon which fair rates can be developed.  To disregard these distinctions would create  genuine unfairness.  If the cost of your insurance is important  to you, there is something you can do right  now. Your U.S. Senator or Representative,  whose name appears below, serves on a com mittee that is currently reviewing this legis lation. He or she might not realize that the  legislation hurts the very women it is  in tended to help. Your letter can make a dif ference. Time  is  short. Won't you write  today?  ",1983

995,1343,13,Mr. HILER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I  too, am frustrated  and rising to support this particular  resolution; that was not the most pre ferred resolution I would like to have  seen but it is the only one in town  today.  I am somewhat disappointed of the  events that took place in the last 24  hours. Yesterday morning Mr. WINN  offered  a  privileged motion, Mr.  WRIGHT offered a motion to refer that  resolution  to  the Rules Committee,  the House voted overwhelmingly  to  refer it to the Rules Committee. The  Rules Committee did not even take up  that particular motion, that particular  resolution. But even before that time  period, when we were in the 5-minute  rule in debating the Consumer Prod ucts Safety Commission  legislation,  the Ethics Committee tried to pass by  unanimous consent their resolution.  In my estimation that was  totally  subverting what the House voted to do  just several hours before that. There  was then an emergency meeting called  in the Rules Committee, 5 o'clock; the  Republican members  did  not  even  know what it was about. The resolu tion that was referred to the Rules  Committee was not taken up. I hope  that the investigation that will be un dertaken by the Ethics Committee will  be more orderly and more complete  than the events of the last 24 hours. I  think there is a  tremendous irony in  what  is  happening  today. We  are  voting  to  send  this matter  to  the  cocoon of the Ethics Committee, while  we  read  in  today's paper how  the  broadened  inquiry  into  the briefing  book, the question of how the Carter  documents came into the possession of  the Reagan campaign is being investi gated by the Justice Department at  the request of the White House; addi tionally it is being considered whether  to have a widened congressional  in quiry into how the Reagan Campaign  Committee obtained  the documents.

996,1356,13,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the  year you joined the House as a young  Representative  from Massachusetts,  Harry Truman departed  the White  House for his clapboard home in Inde pendence, Mo.  During his 7 years as President, he  concluded  the peace with Germany  and Japan; presided over the transi tion to a peacetime economy, launched  the Marshall plan and the Berlin air lift and initiated the modern struggle  for  guaranteed  civil  rights.  His  achievements, so  long overlooked by  political pundits, could be  listed  in  great detail, but President Truman  would have objected to such elaborate  attention. He was a simple fellow of  few  words,  and  any  commentary  should be fashioned after his model:  short and sweet, and if not sweet, at  least short.  I am delighted by the idea that on  the  lOOth  anniversary of Mr. Tru man's birth the Congress will have a  joint committee-on which you will  sit-to  assist  in  organizing  a  com memorative celebration. Mr. Truman  was no stranger to Maryland. Indeed,  not far from my home in St. Mary's  County is the small island of Jeffer son, where Mr. Truman would convene  with Governor Richie and call to the  poker  table a quorum of  the area's  finest players for the purpose of dem onstrating the random probabilities of  drawing an inside straight. Few in pol itics  could  ever  bluff Maryland's  Albert C. Richie, in a legislature or on  a card table. But President Truman  seldom worried at his game, and it is  said, never bluffed.  Clearly  and  strongly  I  support  House Joint Resolution 126. I encour age any colleague who may consider  these times too tumultuous to permit  such celebration to recall the turbu lent years of the Truman presidency.  We should never be too busy to reflect  on the trials of those who did so much  to open a period in American history  which,  even  as we  speak, may be  facing its most grueling challenge.  e ",1983
997,1356,13,Mr. WON PAT.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to join my colleague Congress man IKE SKELTON in saluting President  Harry S Truman's lOOth birthday.  I well remember the days of Harry  Truman in the White House. And so  do my fellow Guamanians. He was re sponsible for so much of the gains my  territory made in the early 1950's. It  was Mr. Truman who overrode the op position of the old War Department  and transferred Guam from the De partment of the Navy to the Depart ment of Interior. That single step did  as much as anything to institute civil ian, rather than military, government  for a  territory which had been ruled  by the U.S. Navy since 1898.  Second,  it was President Truman  who supported and later signed legisla tion known as the Guam Organic Act  which granted American citizenship to  the people of my  territory. All  too  often Americans take their citizenship  for granted, not realizing what a cher ished possession  it really  is. We on  Guam do not take our citizenship for  granted. I know what it was like not to  have citizenship and my American citi zenship is one of my most prized pos sessions-thanks in part to the wisdom  and friendship of President Truman.  Obviously, we on Guam remember  Mr. Truman with the fondest memo ries. And we always will.

While I  believe we need a well-trained and  well-equipped  defense,  I  share  the  NEA's concern about the production  of excessive nuclear weaponry which  can only result in a continuing and es calating arms race.  NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION,  Washington, D.C., June 29, 1983.  DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The House of Rep resentatives is expected to vote soon after  the July 4th recess on funding authoriza tion for the first 27 MX missiles. This is an  issue  of  overriding  importance  for  the  future direction of our country's national  security and arms control policies.  Halting funds for production will not jeop ardize our national  security. Production,  however, will result in another dangerous  escalation of the arms race by both sides.  NEA strongly urges you  to oppose any  funds for production or development of the  MX missile and  to support the Bennett/  Mavroules amendment which would delete  $2.5 billion for production of the first 27  missiles.

SOLARZ  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 29, 1983   ",1983
1001,1408,13,Mr.  SOLARZ.," Mr.  Speaker,  last  month the New York State Legisla ture adopted a resolution, introduced  by Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, call ing upon the United States to assist  this ancient Jewish community. Be cause of the importance of this issue, I  insert this resolution in today's CoN GRESSIONAL RECORD.  Similar  legislation  is  currently  before  the House.  I  recently  intro duced House Concurrent Resolution  107, which expresses the concern of  the Congress  for  the plight of  the  Jewish community in Ethiopia. I hope  that other Members will  join the 48  Members who have already cospon sored this resolution.  June 30, 1983  The Ethiopian  Jewish  community  has survived centuries of conversion  attempts by missionaries, and harass ment and persecution by various re gimes.  Freedom of religion is officially rec ognized in Ethiopia. However, accord ing to the State Department's ""Coun try Reports on Human Rights Prac tices for 1982,"" the Falasha, meaning  ""stranger or landless one,"" have suf fered from obstacles to the practice of  their religion, and other severe dis crimination.  The Falasha are also  among  the  800,000 Ethiopians hard hit by  the  severe drought, Ethiopia's worst since  1973,  that has  swept  the northern  parts of the country.  As a result of their ongoing difficul ties in Ethiopia, many of the Falasha  have sought to emigrate so that they  might  live  in  freedom and practice  their  religion without  interference.  Unfortunately, the Ethiopian Govern ment frowns upon emigration. Despite  these  restrictions,  several  thousand  Ethiopian Jews have fled over the bor ders  to neighboring countries where  they live as refugees.  Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to com mend  and  congratulate New York  State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein  and his colleagues for passing this res olution. Mr. Ohrenstein has long been  a champion of humanitarian causes,  and his resolution in support of the  Ethiopian Jews eloquently asserts the  importance of providing assistance to  this long-suffering people.  RESOLUTION  (Legislative resolution calling upon the Gov ernment of the United States, through its  President,  its State Department and its  Congress, to extend the help of its diplo matic offices to the Ethiopian Jews by ne gotiating with the several countries where  they now live to permit them to depart for  other  hospitable  shores  of  their  own  choosing)  Whereas,  The  Ethiopian  Jews  are  amongst the oldest continuous Jewish com munities in existence, their history extend ing back for three thousand years; and  Whereas, From heights of power and in fluence in that African country, they were  finally defeated in battle and forever after  experienced only poverty, landlessness, po litical impotency, religious persecution and  discrimination; and  Whereas, Once numbering nearly one mil lion, their present census has been radically  reduced to only twenty thousand, of which  several  thousand are suffering bitterly as  helpless refugees in another county in the  Horn of Africa; and  Whereas, They have daily prayed for cen turies that they might be able  to live  in  peace and security amongst their kinsmen  in other lands; and  Whereas, The United States has always  been a haven for the persecuted and down trodden of other countries, immigrants who  after arrival have contributed significantly  to the development of this great land; and  Whereas, This ancient group is in danger  of actual physical extinction unless immedi ate  large scale assistance  is  forthcoming  ",1983
1002,1421,13,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Speaker, the terri ble brutality of the Khomeini regime  in Iran becomes more and more appar ent daily. One of the gravest crimes  that regime is now committing against  humanity  is  their merciless persecu tion of the Bahais.  There is no more blatant case of reli gious persecution in the world today  than that which is taking place in Iran  against the Bahais. I believe it is in cumbent upon all of us to speak out as  strongly as we can in an effort to per suade  the Ayattollah Khomeini and  his government to stop their campaign  of eradication of Bahais.  Roy Mottahedeh recently described  the horrors of  this anti-Bahai cam paign in the New York Times and I  submit his analysis  to be  reprinted  here:  for  [From the New York Times, June 22, 1983]  WHY DOES IRAN KILL BAHAIS?  <By Roy P. Mottahedeh)  PRINCETON, N.J.-News of the barbarous  execution on Thursday and Friday of 16  Bahais  in  the  southern  Iranian  city  of  Shiraz has shattered the small remaining  hope of many well-wishers of the Iranian  revolution who kept saying, as I did: ""Wait,  give it time.""  Six men and 10 women,  including three  teenage girls, without publicly announced  charges or public trial, were hanged, appar ently for the mere crime of adherence to a  religion. For, as the Islamic judge explained  to the newspapers: ""It is absolutely certain  that in the Islamic Republic of Iran there is  no place whatsoever for Bahais and Baha ism.''  It is becoming  increasingly unclear  whom there is a place in Iran.  It was possible to understand why the Ira nian Government felt  that there was no  . place for the radical left, which advocated  armed struggle against the existing Govern ment.  It was harder-but just possible, given the  deep  differences  between  peoples  about  ideas of propriety-to understand why there  was no place for women who went out in  public without their hair covered.  It was even harder  to understand why  there was no place for the Iranian Commu nist Party, which had repeatedly and slav ishly declared itself to be in total support of  the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  But no room for the Iranian Bahais?  No room for 300,000 Iranians who specifi cally repudiate rebellion against any duly  constituted government such as the present  Government of Iran?  No room for the only people who, besides  the Zoroastrians,  consider  Iran a  sacred  land and revere the Persian language as a  language of revelation?  For the only religion in Iran besides Islam  that, however much it may look to a proph et subsequent  to Mohammed, accepts  the  belief of Moslems that the Koran is an in fallible revelation from God, presented in a  text that, unlike the Old and New TestaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the  ments, has never been corrupted by  tampering of men?  Well-wishers of the revolution waited and  gave it time-and for what?  To see the promise of parliamentary de mocracy blasted by an intolerance of any  political party that meekly disagrees with  the Government?  To find the universities still largely shut  four years after the revolution, while Irani ans suffer from a severe shortage of quali fied teachers and technical experts?  To see proud, courageous Iranian soldiers  lay down their lives in human wave attacks  in the stalemated war against Iraq, a coun try that is a third the size of Iran in popula tion and wealth?  Perhaps today's Iranian authorities find  the Bahais a good focus for their genocidal  fantasies precisely because this Government  wishes to make clear that it wants nothing  to do with early hopes for a Government re ligious  in morality  and  democratic  in  method. Hang a few teenage girls, and ev eryone will get the point: The rulers of Iran  do not need to consult the Iranian people  because  they know what's best for  Iran,  whether Iranians like it or not-and, by the  same token, they do not want a freely given  moral consensus because they trust only co ercion.  Shiite Islam, the religion of the great ma jority of the Iranian people, puts a greater  emphasis on reason  than does any other  form of Islam or do most other religions in  the world. Then why the irony-why do the  present rulers of Iran so desperately dis trust reason?  Do they trust coercion more because they  have secretly admitted to themselves that  they are unable to change anyone's opinion  through reasoned discussion?  Or, do they really believe that reason-or,  for that matter, any form of persuasion that  can win meaningful  assent  to  religious  truth-operates only on people who live in  the shadow of the hangman's noose?  The Islamic Republic of Iran-how neatly  and thoroughly it has come to belie every  part of its name.  It is hardly Iranian in that it finds it nec essary to hang 16 Bahais-in addition to the  scores it has killed in recent years-merely  for the ""crime"" of professing a religion that  believes Iran to be a sacred land.  It is hardly a republic: A state that so ter rifies and coerces its people is a republic in  only some contorted sense of the word.  It is hardly Islamic in the spirit of the  Koranic verse <10:99): ""If it had been your  Lord's will, they would all have believed, all  who are on earth! Will you  then compel  mankind, against their will, to believe?""  It is, in fact, hardly religious-it is diffi cult to imagine any tradition motivated by  the spirit of true religion, that would not  cry: ""Shame on these cowardly killers of de fenseless people!""e  SHORE UP!

1005,1434,13,Mr.  RUDD.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  the  strength  of America's  free market  system has always been one of our Na tion's greatest assets  in the ongoing  struggle for freedom and democracy in  the world. More recently, the balance  of food power has become a prominent  ingredient in East-West relations and  has brought out a clear ideological dis parity the world cannot ignore.  The proven failure of the Soviet eco nomic system-a centralized, wholly  government-controlled  structure  which offers no private enterprise, no  individual decisionmaking, no  incen tives or profit, no flexibility-cannot  go  unnoticed.  In  the  agricultural  sector,  for  instance,  the  Soviets  employ 26 million workers-or slaves yet still cannot feed their own people.  Our Nation, by contrast, has fewer  than  4 million  farmers who  can  produce twice as much food, and more.  The ultimate irony is that we have to  take measures to slow American agriAs  to prevent over cultural production  supply.  the Soviet Union  relies more  heavily on American grain exports,  the issue of food as a diplomatic tool  becomes increasingly apparent in our  bilateral relations. The significance of  this  issue should not be overlooked  within the debate on overall strategic  balance in the world.  A recent interview published in the  International Wildlife issue for July August 1983, with Lester R. Brown, an  authority on world agriculture and re source matters, provides  insight on  this development. The article, ""Rus sia's Achilles' Heel,"" follows:  RussiA's AcHILLEs' HEEL  <Food is the earth's most critical resource,  and increasingly it is becoming a political  issue. Here, Lester R. Brown, an authority  on world  agriculture  and  renewable  re sources, makes some astonishing observa tions about how American abundance and  Soviet farm problems may lead to easing of  tensions between the super powers. Brown,  a founder of the World-watch Institute, a  Washington-based  think  tank, was  inter viewed  by  International Wildlife  editor  John Strohm.>  Q. Has the balance of food power shifted  decisively between the two superpower?  A. Yes! Last year for the first time U.S.  farmers doubled the grain output of their  Soviet counterpart, 331 million tons to 165.  The Soviets are in deep trouble on the farm  frout.  Q. How bad?  A. Last year the U.S.S.R. imported 45 mil lion tons of grain-more than any country  in history. More  than half of  that came  from North America. As of early 1983, the  Soviets appeared  to be  trying  to  reduce  grain imports from the U.S. to punish the  Reagan  administration  for  its now-aban doned pipeline embargo.  Q. But the Soviets used to export grain.  A. They did until 1970. That year they ex ported 8 million tons; the U.S. exported 38  million tons. But in 1981 U.S. grain exports  had skyrocketed to a staggering 115 million  tons, while the Soviets had to import 34 mil lion tons.  Q. And that's why you believe com, wheat  and soybeans may be as important as nucle ar warheads in dealing with the Soviets?  A.  I believe the shift in the agricultural  power balance in favor of the U.S. provides  an opportunity  to  reshape relations with  the Soviet Union.  Q. What happened? Are the Soviets fail ures as farmers?  A. Not exactly. Much of their land is too  hot, or too cold,  too wet or too .dry. Com  won't mature in the Moscow region which is  as far north as Hudson Bay. But the real  problem  is  that  the Soviet  system  just  doesn't work very well with farming.  Q. What do you mean by that?  A. Farmers' freedom  to make their own  decisions in response to market forces is one  reason U.S. farmers get 16 tons of grain per  ton of fertilizer used. In the Soviet Union,  they get only 6 tons per ton of fertilizer, be cause  it's often used  inefficiently,  if not  wastefully.  Q. Why's that?  A. Farm management which  is made-in Moscow simply can't respond to real needs  of farmers in the field. In agriculture five year plans distort the situation they are in tended to manage.  A.  A.  force  Q. If centralized planning hurts Soviet ag riculture, why is the U.S. plagued by crop  surpluses? Our farms are getting bigger and  bigger, with fewer farmers.  It's not the same. About 2.4 million  farms-mostly  family owned-account  for  cultivation of 350 million acres in the U.S.  The Soviet Union has 20,800 state farms  averaging 13,000 acres each and 26,000 col lectives averaging 9,000 acres each.  Q. Productivity per person must be terri bly low on Soviet farms.  A. True. The Soviet  farm  labor  totals 26 million; the U.S. 3.7 million.  Q. So with only one-seventh the manpow er, American farmers produce twice as much  food?  A. Correct. And this is what worries the  Kremlin. A centralized agricultural system  relying on five-year-plans cannot begin  to  match the flexibility of a system in which  basic decisions are made by individual farm ers.  Q. What can they do about it?  A. I'm afraid that fixing the ills of Soviet  agriculture without reforming  the system  will be like treating the symptoms of an ill ness rather than the cause.  Q. Let's get back to diplomacy. Can Soviet  farm problems be a boon to peace?  Each  day  in  1982  two  20,000-ton  freighters loaded with grain left the U.S. for  the Soviet Union. No other country has  dominated world grain  trade as  the U.S.  does. The Soviets are probably not going to  war against  the country  that has helped  raise the standard of living of the Russian  people while masking failures of their own  system.  Q. What's the significance of all that?  A. This massive new commercial link may  represent the most important change in re lations between the two countries since the  Cold War.  Q. In what way?  A. The Soviets know  they need us  to  produce food for their people to eat. They  may talk belligerently but in effect, we have  become their agricultural partners and I be lieve we  can negotiate political problems  from a position of strength. In  the final  analysis, the long line of grain-laden ships  that links U.S.  farms with Soviet dining  tables may come to dominate overall rela tions.   REMEMBERING BILL MILLER  HON. JOHN J.

1007,1447,13,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I  join my colleagues  and  subcommittee  chairman,  Mr.  JoNES, in introducing the Soil Conser vation Act of 1983.  Today we face a nationwide soil ero sion problem which is, at least in part,  the result of outdated Federal farm  policy.  the  1970's, our national  policy was to plow fence row to fence  row  in order to meet both domestic  and international demands for our ag ricultural products. Today we face a  twofold problem as a result.  First of all, as we all know, we have  huge surpluses which continue to de press  agricultural markets.  Second,  much of the soil that farmers plowed  up during  the 1970's to meet rising  demand was highly erosive. In more  conservation-oriented  times,  these  lands would have been left as natural  grass lands and pasture.  The Soil Conservation Act of 1983 is  designed  to  turn millions  of  these  acres of land back to a natural state. A  great deal of our erosion problems  could be solved by returning some 30  million acres now in cropland to grass land.  In my home State of Missouri, 3.1  million acres of farmland, about 8 per cent of our State total, is eroding away  at the rate of 42 tons of soil per acre  per year.  The Soil Conservation Act of 1983  provides  incentives  for  farmers  to  return some of their lands to pasture  and  to continue good crop  rotation  systems. There are mechanisms within  the bill to protect farmers from losing  out when the next land diversion or  PIK  program  is  announced. And,  farmers who cropped highly erodible  land prior to 1982 are grandfathered  so they would not be penalized for fol lowing a Government-encouraged pro gram in the last decade. However, our  ",1983
1008,1460,13,Mr. BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, since the Air Canada fire ear lier this month, Americans have been  more aware of the dangers of fire on  aircraft carriers. Recently, the Federal  Aviation  Administration  indicated  that they will be issuing new regula tions requiring a protective coating on  airplane seats to make them more fire retardant.  I  commend  the FAA ac tions, but there is still more that can  be done by individuals and legislators.  I recommend to my colleagues an arti cle in the Christian Science Monitor  by Mr. William N. Plymat. His correla tion between drinking, smoking, and  fires is especially noteworthy.  [From the Christian Science Monitor, June  22, 1983]  How To REDucE FIRE DANGERS ON PLANEs  <By William N. Plymat)  Investigators may finally conclude that an  electrical short and not a carelessly discared  cigarette caused the fire in the Air Canada  jet earlier this month. But still there is a  severe fire danger to the public from the  combination of smoking and drinking on  planes.  In the past few months a number of new  bars have been constructed on concourses at  the Chicago airport and I have observed  many  persons  drinking  before  boarding  planes. It may be true elsewhere. I've seen  such a new bar in the Des Moines airport.  Thus in many cases a drink or two is ob tained before boarding. Then on the plane  first-class passengers get offered free drinks.  Rep. Charles E. Bennett, Democrat of Flori da, has a bill in Congress to ban free drinks  and cigarettes from airplanes <HR 54). Some  years ago there was a limit of ""two drinks.""  Now attendants may refuse drinks only to  person who appear intoxicated.  By  the  time  lunch or dinner  is  served  many passengers have had  four or  five  drinks within an hour. In the air at 35,000  feet cabins are pressurized to an altitude of  6,000 to 8,000 feet and oxygen is limited so it  takes longer to metabolize drinks. Some say  that one drink at such altitude is equal to  two on the ground at 1,000-foot altitude.  A passenger may have drinks before lunch  or dinner and then have a cigarette. The  passenger then goes to the restroom on the  P.lane and remembers that a flight attend ant reminded passengers at the start of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  flight that smoking is not permitted in the  toilet for safety reasons. And so an alcohol impaired passenger looks for a place to drop  his cigarette. And in such a case is very apt  to be careless and drop it in the bin for  waste paper towels.  This danger is further  increased by the  fact that cigarettes contain chemicals put  there to keep them burning until usually  they burn out in an ash tray after about 20  minutes. A bill to stop manufacturers from  doing this is in Congress but appears to be  locked up in a committee. Many wonder if  campaign contributions to committee mem bers from the tobacco industry have had an  influence. In the New York Assembly  re cently such a bill passed by a vote of 123 to  13, in spite of extensive lobbying by tobacco  interests, and it is hoped it will pass in their  Senate.  What should be done?  The government or carriers could ban  smoking and/ or drinking on planes, and air ports could close down their new bars. One  Texas airline bans all smoking on its planes  and seems to be doing well. Carriers could  cut out the free drinks in first class and in  several ways reduce the overall consumption  on the planes.  A special reason for cutting out drinking  on planes is the danger that exists in the  case of crash landings. In such cases every one is supposed to be off the plane in 90 sec onds under Federal Aviation Administration  rules. In the case of a packed plane there is  real danger that an impaired passenger may  move slowly or stumble and block aisles.  Automatic fire extinguishers and smoke  detectors can be placed  in all  toilets on  planes. And new inflammable materials can  be used inside planes. Passengers can reduce  their own personal risk too. They can start  their flights on planes taking off early in  the morning, enabling them in most cases to  reach  their destinations before  the noon  lunch period when drinking usually starts.  Passengers can also advise one airline flying  from St. Louis to Washington to drop its  wine-tasting parties  in flight. The airline  serves three small glasses of different wines  with refills offered to each passenger. And  after that, they can buy drinks.  The public can also advise one carrier that  brags about its new flying cocktail lounges  on its large planes that it does not approve  of this feature. And in some cases it can  elect to travel on Amtrak.  <William N.

PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983  e ",1983
1009,1460,13,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducting today, along with my col league  from  California,  HowARD  BERMAN, legislation that will authorize  the  Federal Government  to  assist  State and local efforts to aid the inno cent victims of crime.  For many  years  public  concern  about crime translated primarily into  efforts directed at criminals-appreJune 30, 1983  hending them, prosecuting them, and  punishing them. While there was sym pathy and concern for the victims of  crime, for a long time little of a tangi ble nature was done to improve the lot  of crime victims. Indeed, it has been  pointed out that the criminal justice  system actually victimized them again.  This bleak picture began to improve  in recent years. Some 38 States estab lished crime victim compensation pro grams to reimburse victims for out-of pocket expenses incurred as the result  of a physical injury caused by crime.  In addition, in many places through out the country, crime victim assist ance programs have been established  to provide victims with services de signed to offer emotional support and  to insure that victims are treated hu manely.  Some  assistance  programs  focus on particular categories of crime  victims-as is the case with rape crisis  centers and domestic violence  shel ters-and  some  of  them deal with  crime victims generally as is the case  with victim/witness assistance units in  prosecutors' offices.  Last year the President appointed a  Task Force on Victims of Crime to rec ommend steps that could be taken to  insure better treatment for crime vic tims. That task force released its final  report late last year, and I am happy  to note  that it recommended enact ment of Federal legislation along the  lines of the legislation that I am intro ducing today. The legislation will pro vide Federal aid for crime victim com pensation and crime victim assistance  programs and will do so with revenues  from  a  crime victims  fund  that  is  largely raised from criminal wrongdo ers-through criminal  fines,  forfeit ures, and penalty assessment. In addi tion, as suggested by the President's  task force, the excise tax on handgun  transfers will go into the fund.  Mr.  Speaker, my  legislation will  enable the Federal Government to aid  programs  that provide  the  innocent  victims of crime with badly needed  services and assistance. I urge my col leagues to support it.  A section-by-section analysis of the  Victims of Crime Act of 1983 follows:  SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE  VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT OF 1983  TITLE I-CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION  Title I of the legislation authorizes federal  assistance  for crime victim compensation.  Section 101 authorizes the Attorney Gener al  to make grants  to eligible state crime  victim compensation programs. The grant is  for up to 50 percent of the ""covered costs""  (defined in section 103) of compensating the  victims of state crimes, and for 100 percent  of the ""covered costs"" of compensating the  victims of crime that occur within the state  that are subject to exclusive federal jurisdic tion.  Section 102 sets forth the 6 criteria that a  state crime victim compensation program  must meet in order to be eligible for federal  assistance:  ",1983

1011,1486,13,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, for the  past few years I have taken part in the  congressional Call to Conscience Vigil  in an attempt to draw attention to the  plight of Soviet Jews and other prison ers of conscience who are denied basic  human rights and privileges-such as  the  right  to practice  their  religion  freely and to emigrate.  In particular, I am concerned about  the plight of Miss Galina Vilchin skaya. Miss Vilchinskaya, at 24, has al ready served 3 years in a Siberian con centration  camp  for  teaching  chil dren's Bible classes during summer va cation.  She was released last August, only to  be taken into custody again in Novem ber. The last word from her was that  she was being held in a  jail in Vladi vostok for  interrogation. Her family  was denied permission to see her.  Mr. Speaker, as one of many con cerned Members participating in this  year's vigil, I hope the Soviet Union  will exhibit respect for basic human  rights and privileges and allow its citi zens like Miss Vilchinskaya to follow  their consciences and practice their re ligion without  fear  of  punishment  from the state.e  THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S  VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION PROPOSAL  HON. WILLIAM F. GOODLING  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983  e ",1983
1012,1486,13,Mr.  GOODLING.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  those who say that this administration  has not kept in close contact with the  vocational education community are  wrong. When the administration sub mitted  its original vocational educa tion proposal it was obvious to many  of us  that changes were necessary.  When the President and the Secretary  of Education  resubmitted  their bill  <H.R. 2940) the changes were included.  June 30, 1983  They were asked to include a set-aside  for the handicapped in order to assure  that handicapped  individuals  receive  equal opportunity for participation in  vocational education. They agreed to  this change. They were asked to  in clude an authorization of appropria tions for such sums as may be neces sary rather than the level prescribed  in their budget. They agreed to that  change. They were asked  to  include  more emphasis on sex equity activities,  including  programs  for  displaced  homemakers. They  agreed  to  that  change as well. They also agreed to  permit funding for day care and for  the operation of State and local advi sory councils. The administration has  clearly  shown  that  it  is willing  to  listen to outside advice, and I believe  that H.R.  2940  has  improved as  a  result. Many groups have testified to  this point. It is  time that the truth  comes out.e  JARRETT GOODMAN  HON. LES ASPIN  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 30, 1983   ",1983
1013,1486,13,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call your attention to a remark able man who has been of unvaluable  service and inspiration to his commu nity.  Mr.  Jarrett Goodman  of Milton,  Wis., a Vietnam veteran, earned a dis charge  from  the service  in a most  tragic way. He lost part of his right leg  when he stepped on a  landmine. Mr.  Goodman  is  now  employed by  the  Postal Service and delivers mail daily  on a route that spans 60 miles.  Recently, he was honored in Wash ington  as  the U.S. Postal Service's  handicapped employee of  the year.  This award was shared with four other  postal employees. I bring this to your  attention now because Mr. Goodman  is representative of a group of people  who  have not  let  their handicaps  hinder their active lifestyle. With the  help of an artificial leg, Mr. Goodman  still  participates  in  his  favorite  sports-softball,  basketball,  hunting,  and fishing.  It is gratifying to know medicine and  technology today are capable of giving  the support needed to assist the handi capped in carrying on as close  to a  normal lifestyle as possible.  I would like you to join me in honor ing Mr. Goodman not only for his abil ity to overcome his handicap, but for  the inspiration he serves to his com munity and the inspiration he should  be to us an .

1017,16,18,Mr. BADHAM.," Mr. Speaker, appar ently some of the membership of this  body has not really been paying atten tion in this emotional argument about  nerve gas production, which it is not,  but it is about facilities for the prepa ration in case we might need them.  The United States of America has  pledged itself not to be the first user,  in an international compact of chemi cal warfare weapons. To my knowl edge, the Soviet Union has not only  never signed this but as we know as  fact in the United States, the Soviets  have used chemical warfare weapons  in Afghanistan and in Southeast Asia.  We know what the Soviets are capable  of doing.  The fact of the matter is, again-and  I  stress  this-the Soviet Union has  been in the continuous production of  chemical warfare agents  since 1921,  with no letup, with modernization. In  fact, in the past 14 years since we have  discontinued the production of chemi cal warfare agents, the Soviet Union  has constructed more than 10 facilities  within Warsaw Pact nations for  the  construction and  the production of  chemical warfare agents.  We must send this message to the  Soviet Union that we will not be the  first user of chemical weapons but we  will be prepared because the logic is  determinant  that  the Soviet Union  does use chemcial agents where there  is no fear of retaliation.

1019,16,18,Mr.  STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to make a few corrections  on some of  the  remarks  that have  ZABLOCKI) has  been made by previous speakers. For  example, the distinguished gentleman  from Wisconsin <Mr.  said  if  you  reject  the  conference  report, it can go back to the confer ence for recommital with instructions.  The fact of  the matter, however,  is  that there is no conference to go back  to because the Senate has already ap proved  this  conference  report  and  thus the conferees of the Senate have  been discharged. So a vote to reject  this conference report in this House  would mean unconscionable delay. On  one of the Nation's highest priorities,  national defense were that to happen,  the Soviets would get the impression  that we were turning the other cheek  after the outrageous 747 shootdown.  As we all know, what the Soviets un derstand is only action and strength.  And  if you do not believe that, ask  Marshal Ogarkov.  I  am  also  surprised  that  distin guished Members of the House would  be so unfamiliar with  the Constitu tion. The conferees, under the rules of  the Congress and under the Constitu tion, are at  liberty  to  take up any  matter that is included in either bill,  either the House bill or the Senate  bill.  We have also heard some expres sions of outrage that the vote of the  distinguished Vice President of  the  United States, a  former Member of  this House, should have been counted  in these deliberations. If you will take  out your copy of the Constitution, you  will find that the Vice President does  in fact have a role in the legislative  process, and a vote by the constitu tional President of the Senate is just  as valid as any other vote. One man,  one vote, after all.  Moreover, there has been some im plication that because the binary gas  item was approved was only one vote,  it was somehow flawed. Mr. Speaker,  let me remind my colleagues it took  just one vote for the highly important  extension of the draft back in 1941,  just a few weeks before Pearl Harbor.  I was sitting in the gallery at the time.  That was in fact a very valid and cer tainly very effective vote. Let us not  try to kid the Members of this House  on what the parliamentary procedures  are.  A  conference  committee does not  work under the rules of  the House.  The purpose is to achieve a compro mise satisfactory to both Houses and  in the national interest. That is what  our conferees have done, and  I am  proud to have been able to contribute  to that compromise.  One final point, Mr. Speaker, I was  shocked  to  read  in  the ""Dear Col league""  letter sent out by Mr. ZA it was stated that ""Secretary  Weinberger acknowledged  in written  testimony earlier this year that there  is no need for more artillery shells be cause we have a usable, deliverable,  BLOCKI  and safe stockpile of chemical artillery  shells.""  Mr. Speaker, this is a complete dis tortion of Secretary Weinberger on  the subject of binary gas munitions.  To clarify this matter I insert at this  point a recent letter from Mr. Wein berger to Chairman Price.  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,  Washington, D.C., September 14, 1983.  Hon. MELVIN PRICE,  Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,  House of Representatives, Washington,  D.C.  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:  I am pleased to re spond to your request for my views on the  claims made in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter  dated September 8, 1983, which urges a no  vote on the Defense Authorization Bill.  Contrary to the statement in the letter,  there is strong military justification for our  chemical weapons request and the confer ence report recommendations. Largely due  to obsolescence of delivery means, our aging  stocks of chemical weapons-the newest is  14 years old-no longer constitute an ade quate deterrent. Our senior military leaders  share the serious concerns <reflected in the  letters of Tab A> that unless we take steps  to redress this deficiency, we will negate our  planned conventional force  improvements,  will encourage the Soviets to use chemical  weapons and most disturbing will increase  our reliance on nuclear weapons  to deter  nonnuclear aggression.  The  reference  in  the ""Dear Colleague""  letter to my past statements on stockpile re quirements is misleading. We have consist ently stated that there  is no need to  in crease  the size of our stockpile; however,  there is a need to replace the current dete riorating, under-ranged artillery projectiles  with safer, more militarily effective modem  munitions.  The ""Dear Colleague"" letter is mistaken  in its claim that Defense officials knew in  early 1982 that ""Bigeye didn't work."" It was  not until results were available from a late  October 1982  test  (previously  there were  over 50 successful tests> that we discovered  a problem sufficient to affect the schedule.  Consequently, we  reviewed  the program,  identified a solution to the problem and re vised the schedule to allow additional tests  required to demonstrate the solution. There  are no production funds for Bigeye in the  fiscal year 1984 Conference Report. The  problem that caused us to delay this critical ly needed system  is being solved as evi denced by recent successful  tests <a brief  summary of the Bigeye program is provided  at Tab B).  The Administration will continue our in tensive efforts to achieve a chemical arms  ban. This year these efforts included the  Vice President's visit to Geneva, tabling two  major chemical arms control proposals and  sponsoring an  international workshop on  weapon destruction to be held in Utah in  November. The Conference Report's sensi ble handling of this difficult issue comple ments these efforts and will enhance the  possibility of success by providing leverage  for our negotiators while allowing a reason able  time to achieve a  treaty before any  weapons are actually produced. If indeed  weapons are eventually produced, the bill  prohibits stockpile growth by requiring that  a serviceable existing weapon be retired for  each new weapon produced.  The Soviet Union respects strength and  exploits weakness. The defeat of the De",1983
1020,29,18,Mr.  FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 6 minutes.  First, I would like to make a general  statement of how I, at least, plan to  handle the remainder of this bill, and  how I  think the majority wishes  to  handle it as well.  There are two amendments of mine  left, which were made in order by the  Rules Committee. Because  they are  very similar, as they had to be at the  time I was obliged to go to the Rules  Committee to present them, it is my  intention only to ask for a vote on the  first one, which is the amendment now  pending.  My understanding is that the major ity has agreed to this and I hope that  we need not go through the quorum  call procedure, but will move directly  to a vote.  On the second amendment, I should  like to take a modest amount of time  to say something wonderful about it,  but I have agreed not to ask for a re corded vote.  After  that, when  the Committee  rises,  it  is my  intention  to move a  motion to recommit with instructions  to set a ceiling on the expenditures in  this  bill. The  ceiling will  be  the  amount in the budget resolution ap proved by the Congress.  After that, I hope we will have a  vote on final passage and  then the  House may move on to other things.  At least that is the way I hope things  will go.  Mr.  Chairman,  throughout  the  debate on this bill and amendments  thereto, I have complained mightily,  but with a great lack of success, about  the special amount that is created in  this bill. In my judgment it is nothing  more or less the old trust fund which  isolates a particular portion of Gov ernment  revenues.  In  this  case  it  comes from the Customs receipts, for  a particular purpose which may or  may not, relate to these receipts.  Our Federal Government authoriz ing  budgeting  and  appropriations  system should have as few of  these  trust funds or special accounts as pos sible.  What this particular bill does is to  force  the  budget-appropriations-au thorization concept to the outer limits.  It is not, in effect, an entitlement, but  it is an entitlement of the receipts of  the funding available for the purposes  of the bill.  The money is reserved through the  year and,  to be sure, the Appropria tions  Committee must  appropriate  that money before  it can be spent.  But, based on rulings of at least some  courts with repsect to this kind of leg islation, my judgment is that the com mittee may in fact find itself forced le gally into appropriating it, and, if not,  it will certainly have enormous pres sure to make the full appropriations  requested in this bill.  Worst of all,  this trust account, or  this special account, is an open-ended  account. That is, through it we make  available whatever sums may be neces sary to fulfill  the conditions of the  bill.  With  the  addition  of  secondary  workers and with unknown certifica tions under this act which may follow,  nobody knows how much it will cost.  Again, CBO estimated, based on last  year's experience,  that  this bill will  cost $217 million. Labor and OMB are  now estimating, on the basis of new in formation, around $500 million.  As I said yesterday, I hope we will  get new figures that will tell us, with a  little more certainty, what those num bers are.  In any case, this particular amend ment eliminates  the special account  and eliminates all of the entitlement  features.  This means  that,  if my  amendment is passed, this bill will be a  flat out authorization which the Ap propriations  Committee may  then  work its will on, in the best traditions  of the House of Representatives.

1021,29,18,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1022,29,18,Mr. FRENZEL., I yield to the gentle man from New York.  ,1983
1023,29,18,Mr. CONABLE.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to  say to the gentleman from Minnesota  that I deeply regret that there is not  more interest in this measure, because  if  there were, his persuasion would  work  on much  larger  numbers  of  Members  than  it  seems  to  have  worked so far.  Indeed, his performance  is  in  the  best  tradition of  the House. He  is  taking a  courageous stand. He  is  a  fiscal hero. The questions he is raising  ~hat we  are pertinent questions that ought to  be answered. We should not be in a  business as usual mode here when it  comes  to  encouraging  this kind of  open-ended spending. His amendments  have been well addressed to the prob lems the bill creates.  I personally would like to associate  myself with everything he has said in  the course of his lonely stand and to  assure him that his work is not unap preciated.  ",1983
1024,29,18,Mr. FRENZEL.," I  thank the gentle man for his comments. I am glad that  there are two of us.  Mr. Chairman,  as  I was  saying  before I was so wonderfully interrupt ed, this amendment removes the spe cial account, removes all the entitle ment aspects of this bill and puts the  House in the position that it should  have been in all along. It provides for  a simple authorization conforming to  the amount of money that the gentle man from Ohio, the principal promot er, said he wanted to spend in this par ticular bill.  So if you pass this amendment, you  eliminate the entitlement; you elimi nate  the special account; you elimi nate the pressure on the Appropria tions Committee; you eliminate all of  the  things  consider untidy  about the Ph-~..;sses here; you go back  to the normal, honest appropriations  authorization budget process that the  House should continue.  I hope the amendment is accepted.  If it is not, we will set a dangerous  precedent for the future that is going  to threaten to burst our budget open,  even wider than it has been  in the  past.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",1983
1025,29,18,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  I  rise  in opposition to  the gentle man's amendment No. 3.  I do so re gretfully because. I have a great deal  of personal admiration for the gentle man from Minnesota (Mr. FRENZEL),  but I think that we have tried his ap proach and it has not worked. And  that is the reason for trying the ap proach in the bill.  This approach  is one that I  think  will work. If any money is tied up it  will be tied up for a very short length  of time, for instance, if this were the  law now,  it would be tied up for 15  more days, because at the end of the  fiscal year the money goes  into the  general revenue fund.  What we are doing here is setting  aside some of the tariff revenues that  we collect and putting them into a spe cial account, to be held there in that  special account so that it can be appro priated  out  by  the Appropriations  Committee process into training and  other program costs.  ",1983
1026,42,18,Mr. SHUSTER.," I thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  this  legislation,  the  rule upon which we are considering  here today,  is the most anticompeti tive, anticonsumer, antienvironmental,  antiagricultural,  antitransportation,  anti-States rights legislation that has  come before this body in many a year.  Frankly, I was astonished yesterday  in the Committee on Rules when testi mony was given before  that distin guished committee by the very distillguished chairman of the Committee  on Interior and Insular Affairs, a man  whom I respect greatly, and for whom  I have tremendous affection, when he  testified that what he wanted was only  1 hour of general debate in this body  on this legislation.  0 1410  At first it seems a bit puzzling, but  then, when we stop and think for a  moment, that is only 1 hour of general  debate on an  issue such as  this  in  which two committees are involved, an  issue in which there are those for it  and against it in the Committee on In terior  and  Insular Affairs,  and  in  which  there  are  those  for  it  and  against it in the Committee on Public  Works and Transportation. And if the  gentleman's wish had prevailed, each  of these conflicting groups and views  would have been given only 15 minutes  in which to deal with the many, many  issues presented with this legislation.  Beyond that, we were informed by  the gentleman from Nebraska <Mr. BE REUTER) and others that beyond the  four different groups and  interests,  there are those from the Upper Plains  States who have views somewhat dif ferent from the four groups that seem  to be taking the lead in the two com mittees on this issue, and the gentle man from Nebraska <Mr. BEREUTER)  and the many Members of Congress  on both sides of the aisle from the  Upper Plains States would have  re ceived virtually no time.  So why the request for only 1 hour  of general debate on  this  complex  issue?  Well, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, as  I  look at  the  tactics being used  in  order  to  ramrod  this  legislation  through this Congress, that there is a  method  and  a  motive,  and  that  method  is  to  slip  this  legislation  through this House as quickly as possi ble so as not to permit the light of day  and the glare of penetrating debate,  fair and open debate on  the many  issues,  to come before this body, be cause  this  legislation  is  enormously  controversial  and  this  legislation  is  enormously complex.  I salute the Rules Committee for, in  their wisdom, not acquiescing to the  request for only 1 hour, by which only  a few minutes would be permitted the  various interested groups, but, rather,  providing for 3 hours to take up this  legislation.  However, once that rule was grant ed, then we were told that the general  debate on  this enormously complex  and  controversial  issue would  take  place  late  this afternoon after  this  rule is agreed to. And, of course, we  know there are not going to be very  many Members here to listen to this  debate this afternoon.  I  am further advised  that  to  the  extent  the debate  is not completed  ",1983
1027,55,18,Mr. LUJAN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  the gentleman 1 additional minute.  ",1983
1028,55,18,Mr. KAZEN.," I thank the gentleman.  I have heard people say  that we  might consider flying it in if the rail road's rates keep going up, but today  we are more interested in the possibili ty of shipping it by coal slurry pipe line.  This bill would authorize coal slurry  pipelines that are determined to be in  the national interest and required by  the public convenience and necessity  to acquire rights of way over private  lands  by  the  exercise  of  eminent  domain.  Landowners would be fully compen sated and they may move the court ac tions from State to Federal court at  their request.  D 1550  The pipelines will be built under ground to the maximum extent practi cal and installed in such a way as to  minimize  conflict with  the  existing  land use.  Now,  there have been concerns ex pressed about water but I think that  issue has already been taken care of  very, very accurately by my colleague  from Wyoming  in  the provisions he  placed in this bill.  The bill expressly states  that the  power of eminent domain may not be  used to acquire water rights, and that  no applications for pipeline certif ica tion may be submitted until the appli cant has  obtained  the  appropriate  water permit from the State. It also  states that all rights to use water for  coal pipelines must be acquired per suant to the law of the State of origin  of the water, and that nothing in the  legislation will affect the validity of  any State water law.  That means that if a State decides it  does not want  to allocate water for  pipeline use,  the proposed project is  effectively terminated and no certifi cate granting eminent domain can be  issued.  Although I personally consider this  legislation long overdue, I am aware  that the period of time involved has  been helpful in fine-tuning the legisla tion on to the greatest extent possible  in a compromise of this magnitude.  I urge you to support this legisla tion. I believe the rights of the con sumer have been neglected and over looked for too long. We have consid ered every angle and heard from every  interest group while the consumer has  been the captive audience of a captive  shipper on the railroads. I believe our  Nation needs this, and I believe our  economy will benefit by it.  ",1983

The gentleman  from Arizona has 32 minutes remain ing; the gentleman from New Mexico   <Mr. LUJAN) has 26 minutes remaining;  the gentleman  from California <Mr.  ANDERSON) has 31 minutes remaining;  and the gentleman from Pennsylvania  <Mr. SHUSTER) has 30 minutes remain ing.

1030,55,18,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Chairman, the gen tleman  from  New  Jersey  <Mr.  HOWARD),  and  I  had an agreement  with the leadership that we would ter minate the general debate this after noon before 4 p.m.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Minne sota <Mr. VENTO). There may be an other speaker at the discretion of the  Chair. Then I will move to rise.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Minnesota <Mr.  VENTO).  ",1983
1031,55,18,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, propo nents of coal slurry would have us be lieve that the substitute bill to H.R.  1010 is simple eminent domain legisla tion enabling coal slurry pipeline oper ators  to  acquire  rights-of-way. The  fact of the matter is that this complex  measure goes far beyond that scope  and raises public policy questions with  regard to the transportation, environ ment, water resources,  jobs, and con sumer protection consequences of this  change in law.  The use of Federal eminent domain  is a power  to be granted only as a  means  to  further  the public good.  Such a privilege requires special safe guards to assure that the public's le gitimate interests are protected. H.R.  1010 is deficient in meeting the neces sary  high  public  standards.  I  am  struck by  the  fact  that  in all  the  claims and counterclaims about  this  legislation's benefits, one fact remains  inescapable-regardless of any other  considerations, the only sure benefici ary of this legislation will be the coal  slurry pipelines' owners and operators.  Congress has been  reviewing  coal  slurry legislation for nearly a decade.  Each new Congress has faced a differ ent coal slurry bill with whole sections  being rewritten or omitted to accom modate  slurry  interests, but always  the central questions about jobs, com petition, water policy, and the environ ment remain unanswered. Frankly, I  view it as doubtful whether this legis lation can be  improved enough by  amendment to merit its enactment.  I believe the legislation before us re mains deficient from a public policy  standpoint in many ways, but I will  only touch upon two areas in which I  have taken a special interest; namely,  the question of water resources and  the use of take-or-pay contracts.  To begin with, slurry pipelines are a  dubious use of scarce water supplies.  H.R. 1010 compounds this initial con cern by  its delegation of Commerce  Clause power to the individual States.  By not having  in place  a  consent  mechanism for interstate water that is  exported for use outside a particular  State, H.R. 1010  fosters  the sale of  water to serve short-term parochial in terests at the expense of other affect",1983
1032,68,18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Iowa <Mr. LEACH) is rec ognized for 30 minutes.  ",1983
1033,68,18,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, at  the request of the Freedom Republi cans I am introducing a  joint resolu tion calling for the designation of Feb ruary 12, 1984, as ""National Abolition ist Day."" I rise to commend this reso lution to my colleagues in the House  for their consideration and support.  I was asked to introduce this legisla tion today to commemorate Saturday's  being  the 121st anniversary of  the  Battle of Antietam. September  17,  1862, was the bloodiest single day in  the costliest and most divisive war in  this Nation's history. While the battle  itself was a tactical draw, its ferocity  removed any hope that the Civil War  could be brought to a quick conclusion  by either side and convinced President  Abraham Lincoln that the time had  come to issue the Emancipation Proc lamation.  That proclamation and the final re moval from our body politic of  the  cancer of slavery was the goal of the  Abolitionist Movement this resolution  is intended to honor.  The Abolitionist Movement arose in  the  first decades of our history as  small groups of men and women came  together to mount a heroic challenge  to  the  then predominant  racist as sumptions of our society. As the move ment grew,  through  the efforts of  such  leaders  as Frederick Douglass  and William Lloyd Garrison it awak ened the Nation's conscience  to  the  evils of slavery and racial prejudice.

1053,94,18,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, Septem ber 17, 1983, marks the 105th anniver sary of  the founding of Nicodemus,  Kans. It is a small town-the popula tion is less than 100-yet Nicodemus  stands as a towering monument to the  ideals of America. For more than a  century, Nicodemus has been a source  of black pride and achievement,  a  town of black Americans who only  asked for an equal chance to share in  the dream of this great Nation. When  you  talk about Nicodemus, you  talk  about roots.  The 1870's were a turbulent time in  American history. Slavery had been  abolished, yet most black Americans  were still held in bondage by poverty,  limited opportunities,  illiteracy, and  rampant  discrimination. They were  not slaves, but neither were they free.  In 1877, freedmen and their families  from Kentucky and Tennessee were  told of a place in Kansas that could be  their ""promised land-the land of milk  and honey."" Here, they heard, was a  State that had always been free, and  the  land was  theirs  to homestead.  They need only pay $5 plus rail fare.  Nearly 300 former slaves made that  long trip in river boats and boxcars.  From the train station it was a walk of  some 30 miles to a spot on the rolling  Kansas praire that was to be their new  home. In every direction, all they saw  were endless grasslands and, too, the  endless vista that only hope can pro vide.  Discouragement at  this unfamiliar  sight was understandable, but  they  chose to make the best of things, and  dig in-literally. Like many pioneers of  their day,  every man, woman,  and  child put in long days in backbreaking  labor-working the hard ground, shov eling dugouts  in which  to  live and  catching  prairie wildlife  for  food.  These early settlers had only  three  horses  and  some  inadequate  hand  tools to work with, but, through sheer  determination, managed  to build  a  proper town in time.  The dugouts gave way to sod houses,  then to wooden structures and farms.  Nicodemus  soon boasted  a  thriving  economy, complete with livery stables,  a hotel, restaurant, church, bank, post  office, and two newspapers. By 1880,  the surrounding county had a popula tion of more than 500 former slaves  and Nicodemus had established  the  first school district in the county.  Perhaps the story of a growing Mid western community during  the  late  1800's is not unique, but the fact that  this particular town was founded and  settled entirely by  former  slaves  is  worthy of a special place in American  history. Nicodemus lives on today, and  its residents are understandably proud  of what they and their ancestors have  accomplished.  At ""homecoming"" each year, former  residents return to reacquaint them selves with their heritage. The Sena tor from Kansas salutes the people of  Nicodemus on  this anniversary and  offers best wishes for many more in  the years to come.  HARRY R. OSTRANDER  ",1983

Mr. Os trander had been a member of  the  U.S. Capitol Police Force since July 13,  1973. The last 4 years of his service  was to the Senate as a plainclothes of ficer.  Not only has Harry served the Con gress in su.perlative fashion in carrying  out his shared responsibility of secur ing the Capitol and protecting its oc cupants, but,  indeed,  all Americans  owe a debt of gratitude to Harry for  his outstanding service  in  the U.S.  Army. Prior to retiring from his more  than 30-year career in the Army at the  rank of sergeant major, Harry was  awarded the Bronze Star, the Army  Commendation Medal with one Oak  Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart, also  with an Oak Leaf Cluster, the Combat  Infantry Badge, and the Meritorious  Service Medal.  Fittingly, Mr.  Os trander was interred with full milita,ry  honors on Wednesday, September 14,  at Arlington National Cemetery.  Mr. President, I extend my condo lences  to Mrs. Ostrander  and  to  Harry's five children at this time of  loss. I ask of the Senate that the obit uary which appeared in the Washing ton Post be included in the RECORD.  The obituary follows:  OSTRANDER, HARRY RICHARD  Sgt. Major USA <Ret.>.

",1983
1099,172,18,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, the  amendment  I have proposed  to  the  pending resolution would express the  intention of the United States to halt  the present export of grains  to  the  Soviet Union as part of the American  response to the Soviet destruction of  Korean Air Lines flight KAL 007.  My reasoning, which I would hope  would win the support of colleagues  here  today,  is straightforward: Why  should the United States provide sub sidized foodstuffs to the Soviet Union,  as normal neighboring countries might  do-when the Soviet Union refuses to  abide by the minimal standards of civ ilized behavior that would entitle it to  be treated as an ordinary, law-abiding  state?  If we feed the Soviet Air Force-and  do not doubt that in that totalitarian  state, the armed forces eat first-what  right do we have to complain about  how that air force behaves? By feeding  them, and then later complaining that  their pilots do not do what we expect  them to do, we invite their contempt  and encourage them to go still further  in the barbaric atrocities they feel free  to commit.  Recall that a central conviction of  Soviet leaders, from the earliest days  of the revolution, has been precisely  the belief that the Western democrat ic capitalists would do this. In his im portant work, ""Russia and the West  Under  Lenin  and  Stalin,"" George  Kennan described what he called the  imaginary statement of Soviet leaders  to the Western governments:  "". . . since we are not strong enough to de stroy you today ... we want you during this  interval to trade with us; we want you to fi nance us; ... An outrageous demand? Per haps. But you will accept it because you are  slaves to your own capitalistic appetites ...  you will wink at our efforts to destroy you,  you will compete with one another for our  favor.  . . .  It is,  in  fact,  you who will,  through your own cupidity, give us  the  means wherewith to destroy you.""  Kennan then says, for himself:  ""I can only assure you that this formula tion is not one whit sharper or more uncom promising  than the  language consistently  employed by the Soviet leaders at that time.  I do not believe that it embraces a single  thought which did not then figure promi nently in their utterances.""  We have every reason to believe this  view continues.  Certainly they shall have additional  reason to believe it if we go forward  ",1983
1100,185,18,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  rise today for the purpose of introduc ing a bill which I had sincerely hoped  would never become necessary. It has  been little more than a year since the  Commerce Committee  and  the  nance Committee joined forces to send  the Airport and Airway Improvement  Act of 1982 and its accompanying user f ee tax measures to the Senate. These  pieces of legislation were enacted as  shining examples of the user-fee con cept that this administration has em braced so warmly. They recognized the  pressing need to modernize our airport  and  airways  systems and addressed  that need by taxing the people who  would benefit the most from the mod ernization.  I am here today to tell the Senate  that  the  flying public,  the general  aviation community, cargo operators,  and municipal airports all over  this  country have been betrayed. The ad ministration has  totally and utterly  failed to carry through on the prom ises that it made during the formula tion and enactment of the AIP legisla tion. The aviation taxes, significantly  increased  last year,  are once again  simply flowing  into  the airport and  airway  trust fund and bloating  the  surplus in that account. Because this  money cannot be spent on anything  other than aviation, the surplus ren ders no substantive benefit to anyone.  It only allows the Office of Manage ment and Budget  to show a deficit  number that is artificially low.  To demonstrate in detail how the ad ministration has  turned on the con cept of aviation user fees, a little histo ry is in order. In May and June of last  year,  I chaired a  series of hearings  that built on work begun in 1981 on a  funding program for the national air space  system plan. Those hearings  clearly established the fact that our  current air  traffic control system  is  outdated. If that system is to safely  and efficiently handle  the  large  in creased projected in air traffic for the  coming  years,  an  almost  complete  overhaul was shown to be necessary. A  pressing need also was shown for im provements at our Nation's airports.  To meet these needs, the committee  proposed  an  authorization  schedule  that represented a  total expenditure  of more than $21 billion over a 5-year  span.  Aviation  infrastructure  improve ments have traditionally been funded  by  taxes  levied  on  aviation  users.  These taxes consist primarily of a tax  on fuel used in noncommercial or gen eral aviation, a passenger ticket and  cargo waybill tax, and an excise tax on  aircraft tires and inner tubes. In order  to fund the ambitious modernization  plan, the fuel taxes were increased sig nificantly.  Due in large part to the accumula tion of a  large surplus in the trust  fund,  the aviation user groups were  concerned that their taxes actually be  used  for making  aviation  improve ments. I shared that concern. In order  to make certain that the administra tion was committed to spending this  money, contributed by  the users,  I  closely questioned both FAA Adminis trator Helms and then Secretary of  Transportation Lewis. I made the fol lowing request of those two gentlemen  at our hearings:  ... What I need is a pledge from you, and  from Administrator Helms, that when we  get this legislation in place, the user fees  will be used. And that we are not going to  use them to mount up a surplus in the trust  fund in order to help balance the budget.  . . . They are to be used for the purpose for  which they are intended.  I  received the following replies,  part:  in  Secretary LEw1s. We agree completely.  And if there is any way you can lock us in in  terms of the legislation, we would be pleased  to be locked in so we are obligated, not only  the two of us but whoever our successors  should be.  We  feel  very  strongly  the money  is  needed. We do not see this as a budget bal ancer. And I am sure that Mr. Stockman  will work with us, because he has accepted  the need for the airports. As a matter of  fact, I should point out, at the time I ac cepted the job as Secretary of Transporta tion, I asked the President two questions.  And one was. Was he willing to make a com mitment to the needs of the airspace in the  future? So not only do we have a commit ment from OMB, but also from the Presi dent of the United States.  Mr. HELMs. Senator, I would add on that  just briefly that the Secretary and I recog nized this is a sensitive issue, and he and I  jointly  discussed  this  directly with Mr.  Stockman to ensure that there was no mis understanding.  And Mr.  Stockman  did  pledge to work with us across the board. So  we do not feel we have any qualms at all ....  It was  that specific commitment which  Mr. Stockman made that we would draw  down the surplus and not let it go back up.  Unfortunately,  these  unqualified  promises did not last even a year. In  the 1984 Department of Transporta tion appropriations bill, the adminis tration supported the Senate version  which cut over $500 million from the  authorized levels for fiscal year 1984.  This action is even more incomprehen sible when you examine what happened to one aviation account in par ticular, FAA facilities and equipment.  The  facilities  and  equipment,  or  F&E, account represents spending for  the construction of critical navigation  and air traffic control equipment. The  authorized  level for F&E  in 1984  is  $1.393 billion. The President's budget  for 1984 proposed spending $1 billion.  The administration documented  the  reason for this reduction and pledged  its support for that funding level.  The aviation community, myself in cluded, was very disappointed when  the Senate subcommittee adopted a  figure of $750 million for F&E. Most  believed, however,  that that number  could be increased to a more realistic  level. Those hopes were dashed when  the administration totally reversed its  previous promises of support.  A via ti on users were deserted by the  very  administration  that  promised  little over a year ago to see that their  dedicated taxes would be expeditiously  spent. The  time  is  long  since past  when the administration's plaintive re frain, ""we will spend it next year,"" has  any credibility at all.  I do not believe that the President,  who has championed user fees as an  appropriate and fiscally sound method  of  financing  improvements, has  f o cused on what  is happening  in  the  aviation area. Nothing could be more  alien  to  the President's philosophy  than  to  collect  taxes  for no good  reason. I believe the problem lies with  a Government bureaucracy that still  thinks the aviation trust fund can be  manipulated  to show artificially  low  deficits. Such bureaucratic actions en danger the entire concept of user fees.  More importantly, the sharp reduc tion in aviation spending could endan ger the timetable previously agreed to  for modernizing our air traffic system.  If such delays continue, we will face a  choice between artificially restricting  air traffic or jeopardizing the safety of  millions of air travelers.  Because the stakes are so high, I can  no  longer  rely on quiet persuasion  with colleagues and  the administra tion  officials.  one who  argued  strongly for aviation tax increases, I  feel compelled to acknowledge an un deniable breach of faith by the admin istration and to fight for an immediate  correction. Therefore, I am today in troducing the Aviation Tax Reduction  Act of 1983. The goal of this bill is  very simple. The Government must  either spend  the money  it collects  from the aviation community and mil lions of air travelers or it must reduce  the taxes it levies for aviation.  The bill would adjust aviation taxes  each fiscal year to reflect the appro priated  levels of  spending  for  that  year, starting with the tax levels cur rently in effect. If only half the au thorized total were appropriated, the  tax rates for that year would be half  As  ",1983
1101,198,18,Mr.  KENNEDY.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am proud to join with Sena tors CRANSTON and DODD in the Senate  and Representatives TED WEISS, MIKE  BARNES, and others in the House of  Representatives, in submitting a reso lution calling for the restoration of de mocracy in Chile.  Our resolution provides  that until  Chile returns to its long tradition of  democratic government  and  institu tions, the United States should deny  all military and economic assistance to  its military government under General  Pinochet-except  for  humanitarian  aid to the people of Chile on a non governmental basis.  Last Sunday, September 11, marked  the 10th anniversary of  the brutal  military coup in Chile. Thousands of  Chileans-leaders  from  the  church,  the labor unions, and the political op positon-joined together with students  and workers in protest against Gener al Pinochet's repressive dictatorship.  They demanded  full  restoration of  democratic institutions and respect for  human rights that had flourished for  over a century and a half in Chile.  Today, in Washington, we also mark  the anniversary of this tragic turn of  history. We are here to voice our con cern and support for the cause of de mocracy and human rights in Chile,  and to demonstrate once again to the  brave people of Chile that they do not  stand alone.  Since  the 1973 military  takeover,  Chile has become a symbol of gross  and continuing violations of human  rights and civil  liberties, disappear ances, and arbitrary killings, and de tentions. The systematic use of  tor ture,  internal exile, and banishment  have replaced the rule of law.  The  Chilean  Government  also  stands condemned for its sponsorship  of the terrorist bombing on the streets  of Washington that killed Orlando Le telier and Ronni Karpen Moffitt. For  that act alone,  the Pinochet regime  deserves condemnation by the entire  international community.  A decade has now passed since the  coup of 1973, but the harsh repression  inflicted by the regime has failed to  muffle the people's demand in Chile  for  democracy  and  freedom.  Since  May of this year, the citizens of San tiago and other cities have staged con tinuing protests against the Pinochet  regime; the clang of pots and pans in  the streets echoes the cry from  the  heart  of  the  growing  numbers  of  people in every section of that land  who are demanding that the dictator ship must end. The entire democratic  opposition in Chile has come together  in a democratic alliance for an end to  military rule. Every day, the people of  Chile risk beatings and imprisonment  for their belief in democracy. A total  of 55  people have  reportedly been  killed during  the  recent months of  demonstrations-15 during last week's  protests alone. Hundreds have been  beaten and thousands imprisoned by  Chilean security forces.  Just this past week, labor leader Ro dolfo Segue!, who speaks for the Coali tion of Chilean Labor Federations, was  imprisoned once again. He has begun a  hunger strike in protest against con tinued  repression. His  cause  is our  cause. His demands are our demands.  We will not rest until democracy re turns to Chile.  At this critical time in the struggle  for democracy and human rights  in  Chile,  the United States must make  clear to the Chilean people that our  Nation strongly supports  their com mitment to the early and peaceful res toration of democratic government in  Chile.  The Reagan  administration  must take no steps that would only  serve to prolong in power the floun dering military  regime  that has be trayed Chile's noble tradition of demo cratic rule and that has been censured  repeatedly by respected international  human rights organizations.  In desperation,  the government of  General Pinochet has attempted  to  make certain  limited concessions  in  the  face of growing opposition. We  welcome the recent decisions to permit  the repatriation of 200 political exiles,  to ease restrictions on the press and  on public protests, and to renew dis cussions with opposition leaders. But  those minimal steps are not enough to  save the General's totalitarian regime.  The people of Chile want a final end  ",1983
1102,211,18,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, in 1968,  for a few brief but memorable months,  the  people  of  Czechoslovakia  ex pressed their deep desire for national  independence,  political  democracy,  and economic reform. As we all know,  their  inspiring  experience-the  ""Prague Spring"" -came to a tragic end  15 years ago when at 11 p.m. on the  evening of August 20, 1968, the forces  of the Warsaw Pact launched an inva sion of Czechoslovakia.  On  this  sad  anniversary  of  the  Soviet invasion, we in the West might  be tempted to put the Czechoslovakia  experience aside as just one more dis tant historical tragedy. We would do  so at our own peril. The brutal sup pression of Czechoslovakia is not only  critical in its lessons for the West on  Soviet behavior but contains an impor tant message for the Atlantic Alliance.  In the third week of August 1968,  Americans and Europeans were not  only at ease during  the  traditional  month of relaxation and vacation but  also relaxed in their dealing with the  Soviets-for 1968, despite the Vietnam  war, was a banner year for detente.  From politicians and musicians travel ing East and West, to the Johnson ad ministration's first major venture  in  strategic  arms  negotiations,  to  the  June NATO meeting where the NATO  foreign ministers  invited  the Soviets  and their Warsaw Pact allies to negoti ate about mutual and balanced force  reductions  in Europe,  the sounds of  detente were in the August air. And  then came the invasion of Czechoslo vakia with its aftermath of a Soviet  appointed  quisling-Gustav Husak and the imposition of Soviet occupa tion forces-troops that remain until  this day.  The Soviets have offered the usual  array of excuses for their callous sup pression of Czechoslovakia: The threat  of counterrevolution,  the  subversive  activity of the United States and West  Germany, the dangers of revisionism.  The truth in Czechoslovakia in 1968  was quite another matter-as it was in  East Germany  in 1953, Hungary  in  1956, and Poland in 1980: The Soviet  Union's first priority is to maintain a  political and military arm lock on its  Warsaw Pact  ""allies"" whatever  the  consequences for East-West relations  or  indeed  relations with  the world  Communist movement. Izvestia would  ask on August 24, 1968-""Can a coun try wrested from the socialist commu nity really safeguard its genuine sover eignty?"" Moscow has given the same  hard answer consistently since 1945.  The Soviet Union demands-and has  been willing to pay whatever price in  the  terms of cordiality and detente  with the West-much more than just  ""friendly governments"" along its pe riphery; it insists on the imposition of  Soviet values and standards on  the  states and people of Eastern Europe.  In the nuclear age more than ever,  such a definition of Soviet absolute se curity is both obsolete and dangerous,  and must be answered by  the West  with a clear message that there are  costs to oppression in the East. The  Soviet Union must be forced to under stand that its crude and brutal means  of controlling in Eastern Europe are in  basic conflict with its efforts to affect  political change in Western Europe.  One important lesson to be drawn  from Czechoslovakia is that the Sovi ets must be told clearly and unequivo cably  that  oppression  in  Eastern  Europe has its price in movement on  other East-West issues of interest to  the Soviets. Surely the rigid Stalinist  formula-""what's mine is mine, what's  yours  is negotiable"" -belongs  to an  earlier era when the Soviet Union was  weak and insecure.  In my view, a Soviet policy of seek ing to decouple Western Europe from  the United States on the one hand and  suppress Eastern Europe on the other  is unrealistic because the West cannot  and will not discuss  the  future of  Europe without discussing the future  of Eastern Europe and Germany. All  unrealistic and one-sided efforts must  be understood and strongly resisted.  What we need, then, is a more cre ative  and more  energetic American  foreign policy toward Eastern Europe  which proceed on two levels: First, in  the short run we must continue to en courage evolutionary, peaceful change  by giving preferential  treatment  to  those states in the region which re spect human rights and those which  try  to distance  themselves  from at  least some of the most disagreeable as pects of Soviet foreign policy <such as  the invasion of Afghanistan). Second,  our long-term goals must be achieved  through negotiations with Soviet lead ers. We do need patience and perse verance. And, about all, we must con vince  the Soviet Union that its own  genuine security interests in the sta bility of Eastern Europe would be  better served by  friendly and  inde pendent  governments  which more  closely reflect the aspirations of their  peoples.  I believe in the possibility of negotia tions because the persistent instability  of Eastern Europe  does  not  serve  Soviet  interests. For whenever  the  Soviet Union felt compelled to inter vene  in  Eastern  Europe-in  East  Berlin  in 1953,  in Hungary  in 1956,  and in Czechoslovakia in 1968-its re lations with the West foundered, the  prospects for genuine peaceful coexist ence suffered a setback.  Mr. President, my call for a more  active U.S. diplomatic effort on behalf  of  freedom,  peace,  and  stability  in  Eastern Europe is also based on an other  lesson of  the Czechoslovakian  experience of 1968: That Soviet repression has not diminished the powerful  political and social forces challenging  Soviet authority  in Eastern Europe.  National  self-consciousness  and  a  yearning for  independence have sur vived  the  suppression of 1968. The  signs of it are still there in Prague and  should be appreciated and applauded.  Mr. President, I recently had the op portunity  to study  the results of a  comprehensive survey of public opin ion  in Czechoslovakia, Poland,  and  Hungary. The survey was conducted  by no less than 10 prominent West Eu ropean public-opinion institutes over a  period of 2 years. The respondents, I  might add, were all citizens of these  three countries traveling abroad, not  political refugees or emigres, and one  of the questions they were asked was  this: Which political party would you  favor  if free elections could be held  again? I  found the answers most in structive.  Only 3 percent of  the Czech and  Slovak respondents, only 6 percent of  the Polish  respondents, and only 7  percent of the Hungarian respondents  said  they  favored  the Communist  party. In all three countries, in fact  the overwhelming majority would sup port  such  democratic  parties  as  a  ""Democratic  Socialist  Party,""  a  ""Christian Democratic Party,"" or an  ""Agrarian Party.""  And I was particularly gratified to  learn that, despite decades of indoctri nation, the young Czech and Slovak  respondents included in the survey ex pressed the same political preferences.

1104,237,18,Mr.  YOUNG  of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker, recently it was brought to my  attention an editorial in the New York  Times criticizing the F / A-18 Hornet.  Several of the opinions contained in  the editorial  in my view were com pletely without justification.  During  the August  district work  period, a  response to the New York  Times editorial appeared in the paper  which  I would  like  to bring  to  the  Members attention so that they can  see the true facts.  The response follows:  [From the New York Times, Aug. 3, 19831  THE CASE FOR THE HORNET  To THE EDITOR: ""When Weapons Flunk,""  an editorial of July 14, based its discussion  of the F/A-18 Hornet airplane on gross and  damaging errors of fact. The opinions ex pressed in the editorial are therefore entire ly without foundation.  It is not true that half the increases in the  cost of the Hornet program is due to ""design  changes and their inflationary costs."" Fully  two-thirds of the program's cost growth has  resulted from inflation pure and simple. Of  the remaining third, most resulted from the  Navy's decision  to buy 1,377 F/A-18's in stead of 811.  It is not true that the F/A-18 program  began <""was  imposed on the Navy by the  Defense Department,"" as you put  it)  in  1970. The Government authorized McDon nell Douglas to proceed with the F/A-18 in  December 1975-a significant date insofar as  it shows the Hornet to be technologically  more up-to-date than aircraft with which it  is sometimes compared.  It is not true that the F/A-18 originally  ""was meant to be a low-cost, low-weight, un complicated fighter."" From  the beginning  the Hornet was intended as both a fighter  and  an  attack  aircraft  superior  to  its  predcessors in performance, reliability and  ease of maintenance.  It is not true that the F/A-18 was ""meant  to replace"" the F-14. The F/A-18 was in tended to replace the F-4 Phantom II and  the A-7 Corsair II attack plane.  It is not true that the F/A-18 has ""rough ly half the range"" of the A-7-or that the  range difference separating the two aircraft  puts the F/A-18 at a disadvantage.  The F/A-18 is not designed to have the  range of  the A-7, which was  a  capable  attack aircraft in its day but in today's envi ronment  is  a  slow,  vulnerable,  obsolete  single-purpose plane. The Hornet can pene trate enemy defenses at speeds 100 to 150  knots higher than the A-7's, deliver its ord nance and then fight its way home more ca pably than any other Navy aircraft. Analy ses  indicate that F / A-18  losses on attack  missions would be less than one-third those  of the Navy's other attack aircraft. This dif ference results from the Hornet's more ad vanced  technology  and  from  its greater  speed and maneuverability.  The factual errors, painful as they are to  the builders of the FI A-18, are probably less  harmful and therefore less unfair than the  editorial's unfounded opinions.  ",1983
1105,250,18,Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to share with my col leagues an article concerning the situ ation in Lebanon written by Daniel K.  Bloomfield, M.D., the Dean of the Col lege of Medicine at the University of  Illinois. Dr. Bloomfield, a widely  re spected authority of Middle Eastern  affairs, states that the reluctance of  Syria to leave Lebanon is directly re lated to the basic desire of the Syrians  and much of the Arab world to give  Israel no respite from their 35 years of  war against her. Those who would be lieve  that  the  Palestinian  refugee  problem is central to the Middle East  conflict, says Dr. Bloomfield, are de luded.  The text of the article follows:  WHY SYRIA WILL NOT LEAVE LEBANON  <By Daniel K. Bloomfield)  The current refusal or delay by Syria in  refusing  to  leave Lebanon helps  clarify  Syria's long range foreign policy objectives  which are: < 1) the obliteration of the State  of  Israel,  and  (2)  the  establishment of  Syrian hegemony over ""greater Syria"". The  latter goal includes at a minimum the terri tory of Lebanon and probably a great deal  more, and both goals are in harmony with  one another. Should Syria ever conquer  Jordan, Israel, and the disputed territories  of Judea, Samaria <the West Bank of the  Jordan River) and Gaza there would be an  abrupt end to any talk of either a Jewish or  a Palestinian homeland. The Syrians have  used and will continue to use the PLO and  Palestinian nationalism so long as both seek  to destroy Israel, but they will have no com punctions whatsoever  in  destroying  any  person or group, Palestinian Arabs and PLO  included, which advocates accommodation  with Israel.  In essence and in fact, the Syrians along  with most of the Arab world, have been at  war with Israel for thirty five years. It has  been a single and continuous war and while  many observers prefer to think of Israel as  having six wars with  its Arab neighbors,  such conclusions are quite incorrect. Only a  treaty of peace can end a war. Except for  Egypt, and hopefully for Lebanon the re mainder of the Arab world remains at war  with Israel in a campaign which the Arabs  began in 1948 and which the Arab leader ship refuses to end. Syria absolutely and un equivocally refuses even to sit at the same  negotiating  table with Israel. For all  the  benefits of third party shuttle diplomacy, in  the long run it has been counterproductive  September 15, 1983  by allowing total obduracy on the part of  states such as Syria for more than one third  of a century.  The United States has tried to play an  ""evenhanded""  role  in  the conflict. Even handedness is a misleading term in middle  eastern politics because it only means a bal anced position between the existence and  the extinction of  Israel. The continuous  Arab assault on the State of Israel, physical ly, economically and diplomatically for 35  years is what the entire Arab-Israel conflict  is all about. The Palestinian Arab refugees  are a convenient and distracting side show  that must ultimately be dealt with, but the  present Syrian  truculence clearly demon strates  that  Israel's  jugular  is  the  real  target and the Arab refugees be damned.  United States foreign policy has been incon sistent because it has been so difficult for us  to grapple with the realities of the region.  We are looking for peace and the security of  all states  in the region. The Syrians are  simply not  looking  for peace so  long as  Israel exists, not now and probably not in  the foreseeable  future. Syria opposes  the  Lebanese  settlement worked out by  the  U.S., Israel and Lebanon because it affords a  measure of increased security for Israel and  amounts to an end of the state of belligeren cy between Lebanon and Israel.  Furthermore, in quarrelling with Yasser  Arafat, Syria has effectively demonstrated  again that except for lip service and propa ganda purposes, it cares little for the Pales tinian cause. Recent evidence suggests that  emerging within  the PLO were voices of  moderation that appeared willing to seek a  settlement with the Israelis. The Reagan  peace plan of September 1982 was an open  invitation  to any  truly modrate elements  within  the Arab  ranks  to come  forward.  Arafat and Hussein engaged in an intricate  dialogue that represented their first step to wards rapprochement since the bloody 1970  Jordanian-PLO war which chased the PLO  out of Jordan to Lebanon. But all of this  was too much for Syria and for the fanatical  hate mongers of the Arab world. The recent  assassination of  the only member of  the  PLO national council who was bold enough  to publicly call for an effort towards an ac commodation with Israel was a sign that the  hate and vengeance spewing forth from Da mascus and elsewhere would strive to frus trate any effort to make peace with Israel.  It is ""death to the peacemakers"" and the  Palestinian Arab refugees remain today as  they have since 1948, the unwilling hostages  of an endless vendetta against the Jewish  state.  Syria can take its intrasignent stand be cause it is backed by Moscow and funded by  Saudi Arabia. The Russians will continue to  work for political control of middle eastern  oil. The Saudis, despite their links to and  dependency on the United States for their  ultimate security have been and remain vi ciously anti-Israel. They continue  to pay  protection blackmail to any government or  group that has the potential to upset the  Saudi apple cart on the Arabian peninsula.  So president Assad of Syria can tell our Sec retary of State, Mr. Schultz,  to bury his  peace plans for Lebanon. The end result of  this sorry state of affairs is that Syria and  its PLO pawns will continue to occupy the  northern and eastern parts of Lebanon,  Israel will draw back to a less exposed posi tion in the southern part of Lebanon but  one which will protect its cities in the Gali lee, the U.S. will have to bolster the multi national force in the center of Lebanon and  the Palestinian Arab refugees will remain  ",1983
1106,263,18,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  call to the attention of my colleagues  the fact that in my home State of New  York, Gov. Mario Cuomo has pro claimed this day, Thursday, Septem ber  15,  1983, Anatoly Shcharansky  Day.  The Governor's action was taken in  recognition of  the  fact  that  today  marks the half-way point in the harsh  13-year prison sentence inflicted upon  Anatoly  Shcharansky,  an  innocent  victim of the Soviet Union's anti-Se mitic persecution. For 6% years this  courageous prisoner of conscience had  endured constant harassment. For the  past 18 months, the KGB, the Soviet  secret police, has attempted to extract  a confession from Shcharansky that  the Jewish emigration movement does  not exist. But, despite suffering physi cal  deterioration,  Anatoly  Shchar ansky persist in declaring the truth:  Thousands of Soviet Jews are seeking  the freedom to practice their religion  in the country of their choice.  Earlier this year, on an offical con gressional visit to the Soviet Union to  meet with the Soviet officials partici pating in arms control talks, I had the  opportunity  to  talk  with  Leonid  Shcharansky, Anatoly's brother. His  message was: ""Carry the story of this  heartless persecution to every Ameri can. Keep working for us, you are our  only hope.""  We need to do more to combat the  tragic persecution the Soviet leaders  are inflicting on the Soviet Jews. Only  a few hundred Jews have been permit ted to emigrate from the Soviet Union  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  this year. In 1979, more Soviet Jews  emigrated each day than have been  permitted to leave in any month this  year.  We must do everything within our  power to open wider that door to free dom, and to help the Prisoners of Con science. On  this day  I  am writing  President Reagan urging his personal  intervention  on  behalf  of Anatoly  Shcharansky, and to Yuriy Andropov  demanding that he order the immedi ate release of this innocent victim of  persecution.  I request that my colleagues join me  in this important effort. We must do  more for Anatoly Shcharansky, and  other Prisoners of Conscience and for  all Soviet Jews desiring their freedom.  Please make a personal plea to Presi dent Reagan and to Yuri Andropov.  Many thousands of Soviet Jews are  looking to us for support.e  ANATOLY SHCHARANSKY DAY  HON. WILLIAM CARNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 15, 1983  ",1983
1107,263,18,Mr.  CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today  has been officially designated as Ana toly Shcharansky Day in New York  State. I join with the people and elect ed officials of New York in marking  this day as an expression of our soli darity with Anatoly Shcharansky  in  his struggle for freedom, and in pro test of the Soviet Government's inhu mane abuse of his basic rights.  Anatoly Shcharansky  is a prisoner  of conscience. He was jailed by Soviet  authorities in 1978 on charges of trea son and anti-Soviet agitation and prop aganda, and was sentenced to 13 years  in labor camp. His only real crime was  expressing his religious and political  beliefs and his desire for freedom. For  this he has been  isolated  in prison,  where his health has deteriorated, and  denied contact with his family.  Mr. Speaker, by shooting down an  unarmed civilian aircraft,  the Soviet  Union  has  brutally  reminded  the  world of their government's disregard  for human life. Now, more than ever,  it is imperative that we remember An atoly Shcharansky,  all Soviet Jews,  and everyone who has been unjustly  denied  their  freedom by  the Soviet  Government.  Today marks  the  exact  halfway  point in Anatoly Shcharansky's prison  sentence. A  sentence  that  should  never have begun at all. Today is a day  for all free people  to call upon the  Soviet leaders to release him, and all  those that he has come to symbolize. I  call on my colleagues and their States  to join New York in remembering Ana toly Shcharansky and working for his  freedom.   24529  WORLD SERIES DRAWS NEAR  HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR.

1108,263,18,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, as the  World Series, the annual fall classic to  crown professional baseball's No.  1  team draws nearer,  I would  like  to  take time to recognize a baseball team  which can already claim to be No. 1the DuBois Little League All-Stars.  This outstanding DuBois ball club cap tured  the 1983 Pennsylvania Little  League All-Star title.  This marks  the  third State crown  that the DuBois Little League system  has produced since 1971. This year's  team,  coached by Bill Nesbith and  Ron Maietta, bettered  seven other  Pennsylvania All-Star  teams  to earn  the championship. These 11and 12year olds then went on to defeat New  York's best before losing in 11 innings  to New Jersey in the eastern regionals  for the national championship.  Also, I would like to take this oppor tunity to commend the DuBois com munity on the efforts they put toward  this championship. The friends of the  DuBois All-Stars contributed all  the  funds  necessary  to pay  the  team's  traveling expenses. In addition, busi ness sponsors made it possible for two  local radio stations to bring the play  by play of all eight games  into the  living rooms of hometown fans. Upon  the  team's return home,  they were  greeted by 200 of these fans including  two fire engines which paraded them  through town.  It is my honor, Mr. Speaker, to com mend the town of DuBois and their  Little League All-Stars. They are an  example of the dedication, sportsman ship, and teamwork of which champi ons are made.e  HELPING TO SAVE THE BAHAIS  HON. FORTNEY H.

The  first  amend ment, Mr.  President,  simply  adds  $2,500,000 in new budget authority to  the Bureau of Mines. The  second  amendment  reduces  by  the  same  amount  funds which had been  set  aside for the purchase of a new facility  at Bruceton, Pa., but which had been  used to offset new budget authority in  this 1984 bill. The House of Repre sentatives and the Senate committee  had included this offset in their bills  because the Bureau had not moved ex peditiously to determine  just exactly  what type of new facility was needed.  At the same time, the facility they are  now using could not be turned over to  Carnegie-Mellon University as is stipu lated in the law.  The Bureau has  just  recently  in formed the committee that its plans  now call for the construction of a new  facility  costing  approximately  $2,500,000. These amendments result  in  providing  $129,925,000  in  new  budget  authority  and  $2,564,000  in  offset  from  the Bruceton  account,  leaving $2,500,000 in the Bruceton ac count for the construction of the new  building.  It  is my  understanding my  col leagues on the other side of the aisle  have no objection  to  these amend ments.  ",1983
1117,302,18,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I rise  in  support  of  Senator McCLURE'S  amendment  to  increase  the amount  for the mines and minerals account by  $2,500,000. As the chairman of the In terior Subcommittee has stated, these  funds are for construction or renova tion of a building at the Bureau of  Mines research facility near Bruceton,  Pa.  In the 96th Congress, a bill was en acted  to  allow  the Carnegie-Mellon  University to buy a building from the  Bureau of Mines for $5.4 million. As  part of the transaction, the Bureau of  Mines was promised a new facility out side of Pittsburgh to replace the build ing  to  be  purchased  by Carnegie Mellon. The appropriation was needed  to provide for the new building for the  Bureau  of Mines  before Carnegie Mellon could purchase and occupy the  Bureau of Mines facility. There would  be no cost to the Government because  Carnegie-Mellon would eventually pur chase  the old building  for  the  fair  market value.  Unfortunately, a contract of sale was  not accomplished until May of  this  year. According to the Director of the  Bureau of Mines, Robert C. Herton,  this delay ""was not caused by inaction  on the part of either party, but by the  difficulty  of  establishing  the  fair  market value within  the constraints  and requirements of applicable law.""  In the meantime, the Bureau of Mines  has reassessed its needs and concludes  that only $2,500,000  is  required  to  build a suitable building.  Completion of  this  transaction  is  necessary in order that the University  may continue to expand its research  facilities. I am informed by officials of  the Carnegie-Mellon University  that  they have been striving to purchase  this property for over 26 years and as  you can well  imagine they are most  anxious to have this transaction com pleted as soon as possible.

1120,315,18,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  cannot support H.R. 3363,  the fiscal  year 1984 interior and related agencies  appropriation bill, as reported by the  Senate Appropriations Committee and  intend  to vote  against  its passage.  While I have several objections,  the  most important are the failure of the  bill to address two issues of vital con cern to Californians, and to millions of  non-Californians who value the scenic  beauty California offers.  First, H.R. 3363 fails to provide any  moneys  in  fiscal year 1984  for  the  Santa Monica Mountains National  Recreation Area. Yet there is no na tional park in the country in greater  need of Federal acquisition funds. Au thorized  in 1978,  the Santa Monica  Mountains NRA to date has received  less than one-third-or just $41 mil lion-of the total $155 million author ized for land purchases. If this bill is  enacted, this will be the third consecu tive year that the park's needs have  not been met. No moneys were appro priated in fiscal year 1983 and only $5  million was made available  in fiscal  year 1982. At the same time, the park lands are under intense pressures for  development. Without Federal funds  forthcoming,  local governments have  no incentive to deny zoning for subdi visions  in this highly scenic area of  southern California. As a result, some  superb parklands have already been  lost.  The House of Representatives-at  the urging of 30 Members of the Cali fornia  congressional  delegation-approved  $25 million  for  the Santa  Monica Mountains NRA in its version  of H.R. 3363. This sum would enable  the National Park Service to double  the size of the existing recreation area  by acquiring top priority parcels of un developed lands entirely from willing  sellers. Plainly this is a critical year  for  the Santa Monica Mountains.  I  fervently hope  that  the conference  report on this bill will include an ade quate level of funding-as much of the  $25 million as possible-for the Santa  Monica Mountains National Recrea tion Area.  Second,  the Senate Appropriations  Committee has also stripped out of  H.R.  3363  all  language  protecting  select portions of the California coast line from overzealous attempts at off shore oil and gas leasing by the De partment of the Interior.  For the past 2 years the Congress  has recognized the importance of pre serving California's spectacular north ern coastline by prohibiting in the In terior appropriation bill  the use of  funds  to  lease  certain  areas. This  year-as the Secretary of the Interior  proposes to offer for sale in February  1984  the entire southern California  coast from Point Conception  to  the  Mexican border-the House has pro tected certain close in, environmental ly sensitive areas of the southern Cali fornia  coast. The House  took  this  action after a full hearing, and with  the support of 23 members of the Cali fornia delegation, both California Sen ators and the unanimous support of  the cities, towns, and counties of the  affected region. The House action also  has  the  support  of  the California  Coastal Commission, the body estab lished by Federal law to manage the  development  of California's coastal  zone.  The proposed  lease sale makes no  economic sense. It would risk destroy ing far more valuable economic inter ests to prospect for oil in places where  energy resources estimates are low. It  makes  no  environmental  sense.  It  would threaten the air quality and the  ecology of  an  especially vulnerable  region. And it makes no energy sense.  It depresses  the amount  the public  will receive for leasing public lands for  development at a time when the west  coast will be glutted with an oversup ply of oil for the foreseeable future, as  the oil companies themselves admit.  Senator WILSON and I have  intro duced bills to ban oil and gas leasing in  those close-in coastal waters where oil  and gas exploration would  threaten  recreational and commercial activities,  commercial and sport fishing, marine  life, air quality and even the military  training areas off San Diego County.  Although our bills differ slightly, they  are in agreement totally on the Cali fornia offshore areas which deserve to  be protected from oil and gas leasing.  Our bills do not affect recovery from  the promising new oil finds off Point  Arguello in the southern Santa Maria  Basin.  Companion  legislation  to our bills  has been introduced in the House and  hearings have been held. The  lan guage approved by the House in H.R.  3363 would have given Congress time  to examine  this  legislation and act  before the next lease sale takes place.  However, the Senate Appropriations  Committee has ignored the history of  this vital House provision,  the  ex pressed will of Congress and the com pelling reasons for including this pro vision in the bill just as it failed to in clude  funds  for  the Santa Monica  Mountain National Recreation Area.  Both the California coastline and the  Santa Monica Mountains are precious  national assets which can be fatally  wounded by  this  failure  to protect  them. I urge my colleagues to join me  in urging the restoration to this bill of  provisions protecting these two price less areas of California.  ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS  ",1983

This is explained simply by acknowl edging that Scoop was genuinely re spected and loved by his colleagues.  He was very competent and consci entious  in  the representation of his  constituents, and  in his relationship  with fell ow Senators he was always  friendly and thoughtful.  I will always consider it a distinct  privilege to have served in the Senate  with him.  I admired him greatly and enjoyed  being with him very much. He was so  unpretentious and so openly warm and  caring with everyone he encountered.  He was, at the same time, a talented  legislator who used his skill and un usual abilities to gain passage of some  of the most important legislation of  our generation.  Scoop Jackson will be remembered  and revered for a long, long time.  MESSAGE FROM THE  PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  ",1983
1124,328,18,Mr.  GORTON.,"  Mr.  President,  Washington was one of three States  that recently participated in the suc cessful pilot phase of the national eye  care project, a program designed by  the American Academy of Ophthal mology to off er medical eye care to all  citizens over age 65.  The program was  cosponsored by  the Washington State Academy  of  Ophthalmology,  and  nearly  all  of  Washington's  200  ophthalmologists  volunteered to participate.  Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, and James  Mason appeared in media announce ments  advertising  that  any  person  over  age  65  could  call  a  toll-free  number for information about medical  eye care. If they had no personal oph thalmologist,  they were  given  the  name of an ophthalmologist in their  area who had volunteered to provide  care. If the caller did not have medi care or other health  insurance and  was truly needy, the care was provided  free of charge. I am speaking of actual  medical, and in a  few cases, surgical  treatment-not merely routine screen ing-provided at no cost if the patient  had no means to pay.  I am pleased to note that in Wash ington, more than 1,500 seniors called  the toll-free helpline during the pilot  8-week period. More than 900 callers  were put in contact with eye physi cians who provided care for them. The  program was equally successful in the  two other pilot States, Michigan and  West Virginia. In all three States, a  total of more than 4,100 calls were re ceived and 2,375 persons were referred  to physicians.  The American Academy of Ophthal mology's national eye care project is  an excellent example of private sector  dedication. Most of the equipment and  services were donated by private firms  and individuals. The Government was  not  involved,  except  in  the official  White House ceremony to launch the  program. President Reagan said:  This <Project) is volunteerism at its finest.  It is the kind of concerned, neighborly help  that Americans are offering to each other  with  increasing  frequency and  increasing  generosity.  Words of support and encourage ment for the national eye care project  have come from key administration of ficials. Chief of the medicare program,  HCFA Administrator Carolyne A. K.  Davis, Ph. D., said in a letter to the  academy:  As you and I well know there are many el derly individuals who have very limited re sources and do not recognize the importance  of medical eye care to protect their vision.  Your effort to reach these individuals is in  the very finest tradition of American volun tarism in caring for the elderly poor . . . It  could become, I hope, a model for other professional organizations who would  like  offer their skills in a very worthwhile cause.  Assistant  Secretary  for  Health,  Edward N. Brandt, Jr., M.D., said:  to Herald and other Washington newspa pers. I ask that it be printed in the  RECORD.  The article follqws:  I commend you and the membership for  the compassion,  initiative and  innovation  that this project signifies. It is in keeping  with the highest of the ideals of the medical  profession.  Assistant Secretary for Planning and  Evaluation, Robert J. Rubin, M.D.,  said:  I am pleased that the Academy has taken  the lead in this important preventive health  area.  There are now plans to expand the  national eye care project  to all 50  States if sufficient private sector sup port can be obtained.  I heartily en dorse the academy's efforts. Sight is  vitally important at any age, but as a  person  grows  older,  three  things  happen that have a direct effect on  seeing well.  First  is  the deterioration of vision  itself. Many diseases and disorders of  the eye are associated with the aging  process. Many conditions can be cor rected, improved, or at least arrested  with proper medical eye care-but the  tragedy is that many elderly persons  are under the impression that decreas ing vision is an unavoidable penalty of  growing old.  Second, older people have difficulty  remaining within the health care net work. In many instances, their person al physicians have retired. The older  person  sometimes  has  fewer  close  friends or associates who can assist in  putting him or her back  in contact  with a practicing physician. Mobility is  increasingly difficult. These phenom ena are common to all medical condi tions, but are particularly acute for  medical eye care, where only ophthal mologists are qualified to deliver the  needed services.  Finally, there is the problem of lack  of resources to pay for care a difficulty  for many elderly. It is a long tradition  in medicine  to  off er  care without  charge  to  the  needy. Ophthalmol ogists and other physicians have con tinued this practice in the several in stances where Federal, State, or pri vate health insurance does not provide  benefits to cover the individual. Esti mates vary, but some studies indicate  that approximately 4 to 5 percent of  U.S. residents over age 65 do not qual ify for medicare. Some are not citi zens, some did not establish a  long  enough employment history to qualify  for social security, and some simply do  not enroll, for whatever reason. It is  safe to estimate that many of these  people  urgently  need  professional  medical eye care, lack the resources to  pay for it-and fail  to seek help be cause of this deficiency.  Mr. President, an excellent article by  columnist H. Scott Wilson explained  the national eye care project and ap peared  the Grandview, Wash.,  in  CFrom the Grandview <Wash.) Herald, May  12, 1983]  VISION HELP AVAILABLE  <By H. Scott Wilson>  Medical help  is now available  for any  person age 65 or older who has a medical  eye problem, according to Richard P. Mills,  M.D., president of  the Washington State  Academy of Ophthalmology.  Dr. Mills said older adults who have or  suspect having a medical eye problem can  receive help by using the toll-free number  of the American Academy of Ophthalmolo gy.  The  toll-free  number  is  1-800-222EYES. The letters E-Y-E-S correspond  to  the numbers 3937 on your telephone.  Any person 65 or older who phones that  number will receive helpful information. If  he is needy and has no ophthalmologist he  will be directed to an ophthalmologist  in  this area who will provide, without charge,  the medical help he needs.  This offer, a pilot project, expires June 17,  1983. The offer is being made available in  only three states-Michigan, West Virginia  and Washington.  Personally, I have met many senior citi zens in the past three years who have bene fited from eye surgery from a doctor in the  Yakima Valley.  Just this morning I spoke to a woman, not  a senior citizen, who benefited from surgery  to remove cataracts more than 13 years ago.  Her vision is vital to her occupation. Regain ing her sight was like a miracle. During the  past three years I have heard many similar  statements, usually by people past 65, some  up in their eighties.  People past 65 who need eye care by a  doctor should not hesitate to seek advice. It  won't cost a cent to ask. It may save your  sight. Remember, the call is toll-free. Just  dial 1-800-222-EYES.  EYE CARE SAVES SIGHT  Nearly a million Americans past age 65  suffer severe loss of vision, according to the  American Academy of Ophthalmology. The  Academy says people past 65 comprise half  of blind Americans although they represent  only 12% of the total population.  The most prevalent vision problems are:  glaucoma, diabetic eye diseases, macular de generation and cataracts. The Academy esti mates 30% of the people past 65 have cata racts, a condition characterized by a cloud ing of the lens. Typically, cataracts cannot  be seen from outside the eye unless the dis ease is extremely advanced.  Although there are many cataracts, most  are caused by changes in the chemical or  protein composition of the lens. Surgery is  the only effective treatment for cataracts,  the Academy claims. Cataracts cannot be re duced or dissolved by eye drops, ointments,  special diets or eye exercises, the Academy  says.  Cataract surgery is highly successful, ac cording to the Academy. They claim more  than 90% of patients regain useful vision  after surgery. Often  the  improvement  in  vision is dramatic. The patient feels a mira cle has occurred, since sight has been re gained. This claim corresponds with my  casual observation the past three years.  Once the cloudy, natural lens has been re moved, a substitute is required, either in the  form of glasses, contact lens or an intraocu lar lens permanently implanted in the eye.  ",1983

1132,354,18,Mr. SAM B.," HALL, Jr., moves to strike out  all after the enacting clause of the Senate  bill, S. 461, and to insert in lieu thereof the  provisions of the bill, H.R. 2717, as passed  by the House.  The motion was agreed to.  ",1983
1133,367,18,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Chairman, I hope  our colleagues will  strongly support  H.R. 3222 which would appropriate  $296 million  for  the Legal Services  Corporation for fiscal year 1984. Now,  more than ever, we cannot afford to  close the doors of justice on the poor  and the unemployed.  Take my home State of Oregon for  example. Legal aid offices  there are  experiencing  a  nearly  threefold  in crease in demand for legal assistance.  The  recession  has  left  a  record  number of Oregonians unemployed.  With  this unemployment has come  more legal troubles, not less.  The results of an undefended legal  proceeding for one who is unemployed  can be  tragic. Homes can be  repos sessed and  life savings  lost  if  legal  advice  is not available  to those who  need it most. If we pass the recom mended funding level of $296 million  for  the Legal Services Corporation,  legal aid of fices in Oregon will be able  to maintain their current level of serv ice, and at least some of these trage dies can be averted.  Both the Courts Subcommittee and  the Appropriations Committee have  recommended providing $296 million  for  the Legal Services Corporation.  This  figure  represents a  slight gain  over last year's funding  level, but it  barely makes up for the drastic loss in  funding LSC experienced 2 years ago.  To put the importance of this $296  million figure into perspective, let me  point out that if we were to approve  funding for LSC at last year's level of  $241 million, three legal aid offices in  Oregon would be forced to close. That  is, 3 offices out of a total of 12.  In Oregon, legal aid offices are usu ally located in small rural communi ties. These  communities  are  often  hardest hit by the recession and have  among the highest rates of unemploy ment in the country. Each legal aid  office in Oregon serves about 10,000 el igible people. Of those 10,000 people  who are eligible approximately one half receive some  type of assistance  from a  legal services program. That  service may include actual handling of  the case,  rendering of advice where  that may be sufficient, or ref erring  the case to another lawyer or agency.  Thus, if we fund legal services at last  year's level of $241 million, 10,000 to  15,000 Oregonians who cannot afford  a traditional attorney will be forced to  go without any legal assistance. Again,  these are the very individuals who are  really suffering the effects of the re cession and  the ones who need our  help the most.  Likewise,  if we approve a  funding  level of only $260 million, two legal aid  offices in my State still will be forced  to close. Ten to twelve staff members  will be laid off and 10,000 needy Or egonians will not receive vital legal as sistance.  With the effects of the recession still  prevelent, now is not the time to be  cutting back  funds  for  a  program  which helps those in our society who  are truly in need of justice. I urge my  collegues to support the $296 million  funding  level  for  the Legal Services  Corporation.   e ",1983
1134,367,18,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  am pleased to support H.R. 3222, legis lation making appropriations for the  Departments of Commerce, State, and  Justice, for the Federal judiciary and  for related agencies.  I  am particularly pleased  to note  that the committee has  included  in  the bill $296 million for the activities  of  the Legal Services Corporation,  which provides legal counsel and other  services to low-income individuals who  might not otherwise have the benefit  of legal representation in civil cases.  Since  taking  office,  President  Reagan has sought to abolish this im portant agency by requesting no funds  for the Legal Services Corporation for  fiscal years 1982, 1983, or 1984. The  President's opposition to fair legal rep resentation for the poor led to a 25percent cut in LSC funding in fiscal  year 1982. The fiscal year 1982 fund ing level was continued in fiscal year  1983, and as a  result,  the American  Bar Association  reports  that  local  legal services programs have had  to  reduce client representation by 30 per cent.  I  am pleased  that  the Appropria tions Committee has  recognized  the  need for increased Legal Services Cor poration activities, but even the $55  million  increase  proposed  for  this  fiscal year will leave LSC funding $25  million  below  the  fiscal  year  1981  funding level.  Equal access to justice is fundamen tal to the American legal system; indi viduals should not be denied legal rep resentation  in civil cases because of  their economic status. I commend the  committee for its support of the Legal  Services Corporation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for H.R. 3222.e  e ",1983

Congress can write a million words  about the protection of States rights,  but that does not take away from the  fact  that H.R.  1010  is  the biggest  public works authorization in the his tory of the world.  Moses did not try to move this much  water around.  And I would be willing to bet that he  had more water to play with and for  fewer people competing for the bene fits of its use.  We spend billions of dollars in this  country to impound enough water to  call it a lake. From that impoundment,  technology assists us in harnessing the  benefits of that water in increasingly  sophisticated, but benign, ways. We  have utilized rivers and reservoirs to  turn water wheels and  turbines. We  have used water's heat-sink properties  to cool nuclear facilities. We have used  its expansion properties to harness the  strength of  steam. These  impound ments provide water  for  irrigation,  water for recreation, water for commu nities' industry and safe drinking sup plies, and water for wildlife and fisher ies habitat. And as these benefits are  extracted in one community, we have  returned the water to the cycle to be  used  again  and  again  as  it moves  downstream.  The use of water in a coal slurry  pipeline system is a radical departure  from the cycling of water as a renew able resource. The technology of this  energy transportation system requires  that we withdraw massive amounts of  water  from a  river basin or under ground  aquifer  and  transport  that  water  to  the source of  the coal-in  many cases, a distance of many hun dreds of miles.  It is then slurried with ground coal.  Chemists warn us that this process in creases the acidity of the water and in troduces heavy metals, chlorinated hy drocarbons, and other hazardous ma terials.  In this condition, slurried with the  coal, the water then moves several to  many hundreds of miles to the termi nal  customers  of  the  coal  slurry  system.  So what we have  is a  lot of dirty  water transported miles away from its  river basin, and in most cases the coal  slurry customers receiving this water  are  in  the Southern  and Eastern  States where  fairly abundant water  supplies already exist. The newly ar rived water supply from the semiarid  coalfields of the United States is not  needed, nor does it arrive in any condi tion to be safely used.  Congress  tries  in  its  collective  wisdom to determine priorities for best  and highest uses of scarce resources.  In the case of H.R. 1010, Congress is  endorsing a  last and  final use of a  scarce  resource which  violates  the  high priority we have established for  agricultural  production,  community  drinking water, hydropower, wildlife,  and all the other productive reuses of  water as  it flows along a multistate  basin.  I am not suggesting that Congress  bar the use of water for coal slurry  pipelines. I am simply suggesting that  in the minds of many, this is a waste ful and dangerous priority to establish  as a Federal goal for the use of water.  It should be a decision guided solely  by State and  local authorities who  share in the benefits of a water source  and are prepared  to determine  the  extent to which the community can  afford  to have any portion diverted  outside their basin or aquifer.  I would suggest to the sponsors of  this bill that you trust no heavenly  signs that your language protects the  Nation's water resources. It has not  rained in the Midwest for a long time.  0 1650  ",1983
1157,419,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I have been listening  as some of our colleagues have been  discussing the current financial well being of our railroads, and their pros pects for the future, given enactment  of  the  legislation  that  is before us  today. And let me say that I am con vinced that we must have a railroad  system  that  is  economically viable.  But  somewhere  along  the  line,  it  seems to me that all of the facts are  not getting out.  Let us  talk about coal production.  According  to  the Department  of  Energy, there were 829 million tons of  coal produced in this country in 1980.  Estimates for 1995 have had this level  going up to 1.5 billion tons. A more  recent national energy transportation  study conducted by the Department  shows that between 1.184 billion and  1.345  billion  tons will be produced  each year by 1990. Why, even the Re publican Study Committee has con cluded that production would hit 1.2  billion tons annually by 1995.  The most conservative estimates for  coal production indicate that we will  see a 370 million ton annual increase  over 1982 production. Even under the  unlikely prospect  that all proposed  U.S. coal pipelines could be built and  operating at 100 percent of their ca pacity by 1995, they would be carrying  only 176 million tons by that date, less  than one-half the additional amounts  of coal that conservative estimates in dicate will be produced at that time.  The 1980 national energy transpor tation study found that only three or  four pipelines were likely to be built,  and would carry only 9 percent of the  amount of coal that will be produced  in 1990 over and above the levels being  conducted currently.

1158,432,18,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes  to the distinguished  gentleman  from  Kentucky  <Mr.  ROGERS).  ",1983
1159,432,18,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today in opposition to the Coal Pipe line Act.  I represent a coal-producing region.  As a matter of fact, it is one of the big gest  coal-producing  districts  in  the  country. And although this bill is in tended to benefit coal, I would like to  tell you why I have decided  to vote  against it and why I would urge my  colleagues to vote against it.  First and foremost,  the coal slurry  bill is not in the best interest of the  American coal industry. It might help  a few, very large coal companies. But  the vast majority of our companies are  small, and not only would not they be  how  this would  helped  by  coal  slurry,  they would  probably be badly hurt by it. Most of  these companies would not ever have  access  to  the pipelines-and even  if  they did, the loss would be prohibitive.  And coal companies left shipping by  rail would  be  forced  into  paying  higher rates.  Let me  explain  happen.  The bill addresses the access ques tion  through  a  system designed  to  guarantee fair access to the pipeline.  Any coal company could apply for cer tification as an original supporter of  the pipeline, which would guarantee  them a certain volume of coal move ment and access to the pipeline. Un fortunately, however, very few small  companies have  the  long-term  con tracts with buyers which would allow  them to become original supporters.  This means that very few small com panies would have convenient access  points. The rest would be forced  to  transport  their coal across  the hills  and hollows-places where  the  rail roads now run but where the pipeline  never would be laid-all the way  to  these  few  access  points. And  they  would probably have to haul their coal  by truck, adding precious dollars onto  their costs.  And even if they could get access,  many smaller companies would  face  serious rate problems when they tried  to use the pipeline. The bill allows for  contracts between the coal companies  and the pipelines. But since the small er companies  rarely have  long-term  sales commitments, they would not be  able  to  enter  into  these  long-term  transportation contracts. Instead, they  would pay on a  tariff basis-and we  would find a repetition of the current  rail situation where we have a  two tiered rate system, with large compa nies paying one rate and the smaller  operators paying a much higher rate.  And of course, without the big com panies defraying  the railroads' over head costs and line maintenance costs,  the smaller companies would be left to  pick up the tab-and this spells out to  even higher rail rates than they face  today. As Department of Transporta tion officials have confirmed in con gressional  hearings,  if  the  pipeline  skims off  the  lucrative coal  traffic,  other users, and that includes smaller  coal operators, would be forced  into  paying higher rates.  So what this bill gives us is a trans portation alternative for the big com panies, but higher transportation costs  for the small companies. In my mind,  Mr. Chairman, this bill is no answer to  our  coal  transportation  problems.  Every year, more and more small coal  companies are forced to shut down. I  am deeply concerned that this bill, by  raising  smaller  companies' shipping  costs, would force even more of them  to fold up.  ",1983
1160,445,18,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Georgia  for giving me this opportunity to par ticipate in this special order.  I would like to say that I am very  sorry to say that we have to gather  here today for such a sad occasion, but  I think it is important that we pay our  tribute  to our colleague and  friend,  Representative LARRY McDONALD.  I  enjoyed, as  the gentleman  from  New York (Mr. STRATTON) did, serving  with LARRY  on  the Committee  on  Armed Services of the House. He was a  very hard-working and knowledgeable  Member, and when it came to work on  projects for his country and also for  his district, LARRY was always well pre pared, and he got the job done.  Yesterday, I noticed that the Naval  reservists were flying a new DC-9, and  I  remembered that LARRY McDONALD  had introduced an amendment to the  authorization bill about 4 years ago to  give this personnel aircraft that was so  needed to the Navy. It was ironic that  we saw this new aircraft flying yester day  because  of LARRY McDONALD'S  amendment.  Let me say that he stuck to the Con stitution. He believed that this coun try should go by the U.S. Constitution,  and if we would look at his votes over  the years, we would see they support ed what the Constitution spelled out  and what LARRY thought was legal.  As mentioned in this Chamber, he  was very strong against communism,  and he spoke out strongly and often  about the dangers posed by the Soviet  Union and by its client states.  I  think LARRY was driven  in his  strong stand against communism by  his love and respect for the principles  of  freedom and democracy  that we  have in this country.  The message that LARRY worked so  hard to get across will now live forever  by the tragic way  in which he died.  LARRY McDONALD will not be forgot ten.  Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my  thoughts to LARRY'S wife, Kathy, and  his family. He will be missed here in  Congress, and I am glad I have the  chance to serve with him.  ",1983

Certainly LARRY McDONALD was one  of the most patriotic Members of the  House of Representatives. He loved his  country and its Constitution, and he  had strong feelings about his service  to his country. LARRY had strong spiritual and moral convictions, and I am  sure he  lived his  life  in accordance  with those convictions.  I do not believe that anyone would  deny that LARRY McDONALD had pur-  pose and direction in his life, and that  he believed totally and fervently in his  cause. As a result of his devotion to his  beliefs, he had impact in his district  and with people in every corner of the  Nation. It was in the furtherance of  these convictions that LARRY McDON ALD gave his  life on that tragic air plane trip to Korea, where he intend ed to speak about liberty and freedom  in that far-off land.  America is a better place because of  LARRY McDONALD'S life, and we shall  miss him very much.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my  own regrets about LARRY'S death to his  beloved wife, Kathryn,  and  to  his  family.  ",1983

1168,445,18,Mr.  PAUL.," Mr.  Speaker,  in  the  attack on KAL 007, America  lost a  loyal friend. LARRY McDONALD was a  constitutionalist, an advocate of free dom, and an opponent of communism  and socialism, the ideologies that have  engulfed half of the world's popula tion in blood and war in the past 70  years.  In the introduction to LARRY'S 1976  book, ""We Hold These Truths,"" subti tled ""A Reverent Review of the U.S.  Constitution,"" Dan Smoot wrote:  the  If the Constitution does not mean what it  says, then we have no Constitution: We are  at  the mercy of  lawless government ....  Never, in my happiest daydream, did I ever  imagine a Member of  the United States  Congress writing a book like this one ....  Congressman Larry McDonald indicts ev eryone and everything that gets in the way  of a Constitutional principle .... The book  factually ilustrates the awful consequences  of allowing our hired public servants to dis obey the fundamental law of the land ....  That  is what  I  think of Congressman  McDonald's book. What do think of him? I  think we Americans have found ourselves a  Statesman.  LARRY McDONALD was a statesman;  that is why our loss in his death is so  great. His understanding of the impor tance  of  constitutional  government  may be seen in these words:  Other constitutions and bills of  rights  assume that all power is inherent in govern ment, but government should be contrac tually obligated to provide certain rights for  the people. The Soviet Union has a ""bill of  rights,"" contained in a written constitution.  It is a long series of statements listing what  government promises to do for the people.  It promises  them social security, medical  care, child care for working mothers, mater nity leave, schooling, and equal rights for  men and women.  In the American Bill of Rights, not one  such promise is made. Our Bill of Rights,  <as well as our Declaration of Independence  and Constitution> assumes that all power is  inherent in the people. Our Bill of Rights  contains 462 words, telling the federal gov ernment what it must not do. Congress shall  make no law is the opening statement in our  Bill of Rights. It expresses the old American  conviction  that  the greatest  threat  to a  man's life, liberty, and property is the gov ernment under which he lives. It recognizes  that government  like fire-necessary  to  civilization, but deadly if it gets out of con  trol.  is  The unprovoked attack on a Korean  airliner by a government out of con trol starkly punctuates LARRY'S words.  LARRY'S anticommunism flowed from  his love for freedom. As the world's  most  successful and  implacable  en emies of freedom, the Communists at tracted LARRY'S attention and anger. It  is not ironic that this intransigent de f ender of freedom was killed by the  Communists;  it was  almost predict able.  LARRY'S love of freedom and hatred  for  totalitarianism made  him  few  friends in Washington, D.C. Congress  assaults freedom daily, and daily seeks  to curry the favor of totalitarians by  extending  loans and credits  to Com munist regimes around the world. The  Washington establishment was  an noyed by LARRY's voice, for he insisted  on pointing out that their most cher ished beliefs about communism were  false and would lead only to a global  disaster. Far from being a warmon ger-as  his McCarthyite  detractors  have pictured him-he was a man of  peace.  In ""We Hold These Truths"" LARRY  wrote:  All  foreign aid should be stopped. Our  participation in multi-nation pacts, such as  NATO  agreements and  the UN Charter,  should be formally terminated. Our troops  should be withdrawn  from  foreign  lands,  and our armed forces trimmed down to such  size as  is needed  for  the defense of our  homeland. We should return not only  to  traditional American foreign policy, but also  to traditional diplomatic procedures in this  handling of our foreign affairs.  Those are hardly the words of a war monger. But  those who continue  to  subsidize the Soviets cannot so easily  escape the label. It is the West's subsi dies  to  the Communists  that have  built  the Soviet Union's military-in dustrial complex to its present world threatening proportions. The contin ued pursuit of such a suicidal policy  will insure that KAL 007 will happen  again and again.  I am convinced that the best tribute  that can be paid to a fallen friend is to  take his ideas seriously. This Congress  and all America would benefit greatly  by taking LARRY'S ideas about limited  government as seriously as he himself  did. He dreamed of a world in which  governments, as well as the governed,  would be limited by law. He was mur dered by one of the bloodiest and law less governments that has ever marred  ",1983

1170,471,18,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call to the attention of our col leagues  an  extremely  informative  report on the Puerto Rican economy.  The article, published by the Institute  for Research on  the Economics of  Taxation was written by Dr. Norman  B. Ture, IRET Board Chairman and  former Under Secretary of the U.S.  Treasury Department.  In the article, ""Puerto Rico and Sec tion 936: A Case Study of the Effective  Use of Private Sector Incentives,"" Dr.  Ture describes Puerto Rico's economic  transformation  during  the  past  30  years from being the ""Poorhouse of  the Caribbean"" to the technologically  advanced  industrial  economy  it  is  today. Section 936,  a  carefully de signed and  tested  tax  incentive pro gram targeted to a specific area, sug gests ways of modifying our current  revenue code  to encourage new pro ductive investment in distressed areas  also.  The  economic  milestone  which  Puerto Rico  has  accomplished  and  which Dr. Ture discusses has resulted  from  the application of section 936.  While calling this impressive economic  progress ""a marvelously successful lab oratory demonstration of achievement  relying on  the private  sector,"" Dr.  Ture also cites Puerto Rico's lingering  high levels of unemployment and ex presses the hope that future policy de velopments  seeks  to  fortify  the  achievements of section 936.  I  enter Dr. Ture's article  in  the  RECORD so that we all may better un derstand the importance to the econo my and the people of Puerto Rico of  the section 936 program.  The article follows:  PuERTO RICO AND SECTION 936: A CASE STUDY  OF THE EFFECTIVE USE OF PRIVATE SECTOR  INCENTIVES-PART I  For those who have a professional concern  with ensuring expanding opportunities for  rewarding employment, there is no better  setting for sharpening the focus of  those  concerns than Puerto Rico. This beautiful  island has been a laboratory in which it has  been demonstrated how  strong and con structive the response of the private sector  of the economy can be to appropriately de signed tax incentives. There is much for ev eryone  to  learn  from  the experience of  Puerto Rico with respect  to public policy  strategies for economic development initiat ed in the private sector.  Even a quick  tour of San Juan brings  home to one a sense of the vitality of the  people who live and work in Puerto Rico, of  their sense of urgency about progress  in  their economic life. One of the most impres sive  attributes of  that progress  is  that  rather than rejecting or destroying estab lished cultural values, it is built on a foun'.~   EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dation of solid traditions. In contrast with  so many of our mainland cities, San Juan's  urban progress has not been at the cost of  losing the beauty of the past. Old San Juan,  for example, spans  the centuries and re minds one today of the sources of the intel lectual and cultural strength of  the fine  people whose energy  is  transforming  this  land economically.  The statistical  record of  that economic  transformation  is  an  extraordinary  one.  Some of the major accomplishments over  the last three decades may be highlighted  by citing a few of the statistics which de scribe the changes in the amount and com position of employment, output, and income  in Puerto Rico.  Slightly more  than  three decades  ago,  Puerto Rico was one of the poorest lands in  the western world-""The Poorhouse of the  Caribbean."" In a little over thirty years, the  Puerto Rican  economy  has  been  trans  formed from an impoverished, predominant ly agricultural economy to a technologically  advanced, industrial economy. It is difficult  to capture the full import of this transfor mation in simple words and numbers, but  one cannot help but be impressed by them.  Measured in constant (1972) dollars, GNP  increased  from $1.565  billion  in 1950  to  $7 .383 billion in 1980. This is an increase of  372 percent. The percentage increase in real  GNP in the U.S. as a whole was less than  half-176 percent.  Per capita real GNP in Puerto Rico  in creased from $709 to $2,324 or by 228 per cent over  these 30 years.  In  the United  States, as a whole, per capita real GNP rose  from $3,526 to $6,475 or by 84 percent.  The average yearly growth rate of real  GNP in Puerto Rico was 5.3 percent over  the three decades; it was 3.4 percent during  the same period in the U.S. as a whole.  Per capita real GNP increased by 4.0 per cent a year, on the average, in Puerto Rico,  almost twice as fast as the 2.1 percent aver age annual growth in the U.S. as a whole  during these years.  This dramatic growth did not occur as a  result of an explosion in the agricultural  sector of the Island's economy. Quite the  contrary; it came about as a result of a tre mendous shift of employment from agricul ture to other sectors, combined with a huge  increase in labor's productivity.  In 1950, more than a third-36 percent-of  the employed labor force worked in agricul ture; manufacturing employment was 9.3  percent of  total employment,  little more  than the amount of employment in home  needlework, which was 8.6 percent of the  total. In 1980, agricultural employment was  only a fifth of what it had been 30 years  earlier, accounting for only 5.2 percent of  total employment. Manufacturing employ ment has almost tripled in absolute terms,  and more than doubled-to 19 percent-as a  shre of total employment. In the U.S. as a  whole, the number of manufacturing wage  and salary workers increased by one-third  over the three decades; as a fraction of the  total of such employment, manufacturing  employment fell from more than a third in  1950 to 22.4 percent in 1980.  Net income originating in manufacturing  was 14.5 percent of total net income in 1950;  by 1980, this share was 31/4  times the 1950  percentage, accounting for 47.5 percent of  total net income. This experience contrasts  sharply with that of the U.S. as a whole  where income originating in manufacturing  fell by more than a fifth.  This growth in output and income in man ufacturing was not financed by exploiting  24737  labor-by paying workers  less  than  their  contribution to total output and income. On  the contrary,  total  real compensation  in  manufacturing and real compensation per  manufacturing employee soared over  this  30-year period. Total real compensation for  manufacturing employees increased by 740  percent; real compensation per manufactur ing employee was almost  three  times as  much in 1980 as in 1950. Over the period  productivity of workers  in manufacturing  increased by more than 31/2 percent a year,  on the average.  As these data show, the growth in manu facturing  output  and  income was  not  achieved by importing cheap labor, an im portant element in the rapid growth of cer tain European economies. Across the entire  labor  force  spectrum, expanding employ ment has meant expanding the number of  jobs filled by Puerto Ricans, almost one for  one. Even in the most demanding manage ment and technical jobs, over 93 percent of  these positions are filled by Puerto Rican  men and women.  Particularly in the last decade, a very sub stantial share of  the employment growth  has been in high technology industries.  In chemicals and allied products, especial ly pharmaceuticals, almost 9,000  jobs were  added from 1971  to 1981. In nonelectrical  machinery manufacturing, particularly com puters, employment increased almost five fold  in  this period. Over 7,000  jobs were  added in electrical and electronic machin ery,  equipment and  supplies production.  Employment in the manufacture of scientif ic instruments more than doubled.  In the pharmaceutical industry alone, em ployment  gains  have  been  remarkable.  From 1970 to 1980, almost 9,300  jobs were  added, nearly 6,400 of which were produc tion workers. The size of pharmaceutical es tablishments grew, from 20 workers per es tablishment  in 1960  to 143 per establish ment in 1980.  The expansion of employment has not  been confined to manufacturing. Impressive  gains in jobs in trade and services occurred  over  the  three  decades.  one might  expect, this diversification of employment  has been associated with a marked upgrad ing of employment. In just the eight-year  period from 1973 to 1981, white-collar em ployment grew by about 88 thousand jobs,  from 40.2 percent of total employment to  over  47  percent. Within  this  category,  almost 43  thousand of the additional jobs  were in professional and related positions.  The rapid growth in the private sector of  the Puerto Rican economy both gave rise to  increasing demands on the public sector and  provided it with  the financial capacity to  service those demands. In 1950, only 45,000  persons were employed by government in  Puerto Rico. By 1980,  the number had  reached 202,000, almost a quarter of total  employment.  One final observation about this truly re markable record of employment growth and  economic progress is called for. It has not  occurred at the expense of jobs, output, or  income on the U.S. mainland or elsewhere.  As the data shows, the most imDres.sive em ployment gains in the private sector of the  Puerto Rican economy have occurred in the  very same industries which have registered  the most pronounced growth  in  jobs and  output on the mainland.  Moreover, Puerto Rican economic growth  has required increasing imports, principally  from the mainland. In 1980, for example,  Puerto Rican business establishments and  households bought $1.5 billion of goods and  As  ",1983
1171,484,18,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take a few moments to join my  colleagues in paying tribute to Senator  Henry M. Jackson of Washington. My  expression of sorrow may provide little  consolation to his family so soon after  his passing. But I do hope that they  will come to realize how deeply his loss  has been sustained by the good people  of Washington State,  the Congress,  and the Nation.  Senator Jackson's contributions  to  American history will long be remem bered with admiration and  respect.  During his 42 years in the U.S. Con gress as an elected official, he served  the people of his district, his State,  and his country with dignity. As a dis tinguished state~man, and a leader of  the Democratic Party, his efforts to  address and provide for the needs of  the American people and the security  of this Nation were recognized across  the country and around the world.  It has been a privilege, Mr. Speaker,  for me to serve in the U.S. Congress  with Scoop Jackson.  Indeed, one of  the most special honors which I have  been accorded in 25 years of service in  the House is to have served with him  on the Board of Regents of the Smith sonian Institution, where he had been  a member for 10 years.  While Senator Jackson will long be  remembered  for  his  leadership  in  many other areas of national and local  concern, I will best remember him for  the key roles which he played on the  board in its efforts to expand and pre serve this country's cultural heritage.  As a U.S. Senator, and as a Smithsoni an regent, Scoop Jackson maintained  his moral and professional  integrity,  his devotion to public service, his com mitment to quality education, his love  for his family and for this great coun try.  The  untimely  death  of  Senator  Henry M. Jackson has left a void in  many  lives and  institutions. Yet his  memory will serve as a vivid reminder  of our individual responsibilities to ad vance and defend  those values and  principles which we as Americans most  cherish.   24750  We  in Maryland are very  familiar  with one aspect of Louis Goldstein's  job-and every spring we are reminded  by him on the radio, on television, and  in the news media to get our tax re turns in on time. Not everyone would  like to be the taxman; but not only  does Louis Goldstein do an excellent  job, he does it with a smile and one of  the fastest tax return records in the  United States.  Louis serves as the chief fiscal offi cer. He also serves on the board of  public works, the highest administra tive agency in the State, is a member  of the Governor's cabinet and serves  as chairman of the Maryland Retire ment and Pension Board, chairman of  the board of revenue estimates, and  chairman of the committee to study  the State debt. He is an outstanding  civic leader, as well, and is a member  of numerous historical societies, and  the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  He is also an active conservationist.  But Louis is equally well known na tionally. He has served as a delegate or  alternate to nine Democratic National  Conventions, and was a member of the  platform and resolutions committee in  1964, 1968, 1972, and 1976. He was  president of the National Association  of State Auditors, Comptrollers and  Treasurers in 1969 and is still active in  that organization. He is also a member  of the Maryland Public Finance Asso ciation and Municipal Finance Offi cers Association of United States and  Canada. He has also been honored by  numerous county, State, and national  organizations for his work on issues  ranging from  the U.S. savings bond  campaign  to  preserving Assateague  Island as a national wildlife refuge.  So  it  is  truly appropriate  that we  honor him on his 70th birthday. He  and his wife, Hazel, have contributed  greatly  to our State, both  in  their  public lives and in their private times.  The courtesy and good humor  they  have extended to one and all are re markable in this era of quick tempers,  curt replies, and canned responses.  The Mental Health Association of  Maryland is to be commended in their  choice of honorees. The association is  also worthy of much praise for its tre mendous contribution to our commu nity. The association's service is criti cally important during this era of re duced  public  funding  for mental  health programs. I am sure that this  testimonial dinner will provide a great  boost to the funding of many, much needed programs.  Mr. Speaker, Louis Goldstein has  certainly made an important mark on  the State of Maryland, and, in particu lar, his community of Calvert County.  I know you will be happy to join me in  wishing him all the best in the coming  years.e  September 19, 1983  CLINGING TO THOSE OLD LONGDISTANCE SUBSIDIES  HON. TOM CORCORAN  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 1983  e ",1983
1172,484,18,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, the  issue of changing telephone rates as a  result of the impending AT&T divesti ture is one which will soon be consid ered by the Congress and more specifi cally by  the Energy and Commerce  Committee, on which I serve. One of  our  former  colleagues,  Lionel Van  Deerlin, a member of the Commerce  Committee and one time chairman of  the House Communications Subcom mittee, recently wrote an article which  appeared in the San Diego Tribune, on  August 8, dealing with this important  telecommunications matter. Entitled  ""Congress Plays Telephone Games,""  Van Deerlin, after citing the benefits  of competition and of cost-base pric ing, concludes that:  Other than the very poor, for whom ar rangements can be made, there seems no  reason for any of us to accept subsidized  phone  service  from  now on-much  less  demand it of our Congressmen.  His approach to this complex matter  is on target and I would, at this time,  insert  the  entire  article  into  the  RECORD for our colleagues to read:  [From the San Diego <Calif.) Tribune, Aug.  8, 1983]  CONGRESS PLAYS 'TELEPHONE GAME  <By Lionel Van Deerlin)  As kids we played a game where two teams  started from behind parallel lines. One by  one we'd try to scamper to the other side  without being caught. At the game's end, ev eryone who hadn't been caught was on the  side opposite where he started.  Congress seems to be playing a game like  that with the telephone industry. Just seven  years ago AT&T sent its army of lawyers  across Capitol Hill promoting a bill  they  called  the  ""Consumer  Communications  Reform Act of 1976."" It was a misnomer. If  passed <and it had more than 190 congres sional sponsors), the bill would have spiked  all competition, present or future,  in tele phone service and equipment. It would have  conferred on the world's largest corporation  a permanent monopoly over not only the  communications we know  today, but over  any device or service  the company might  provide in the years to come.  In  justifying  so  audacious a  departure  from the principles of competition, its law yers explained that the telephone business  was  a  ""natural monopoly""  that would  become less efficient, if shared with com petitors. They argued for continuing the ac knowledged subsidy that long-distance tolls  have provided to local users, keeping home subscriber rates artificially low.  The prevailing mood  in Congress back  then was that competition was the best way  to  improve service and keep  rates down.  This already has been demonstrated on the  equipment side of the business-not only by  the variety of  individual  telephones  then  coming onto the market but in ever new and  more  efficient PBS  systema.

1173,497,18,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr.  Speaker,  while much of the Nation's attention  these last few weeks has been focused  on disasters abroad, our Nation has ex perienced a true catastrophe at home.  I  refer  to  the  unprecedented  drought of 1983, which has created  Dust Bowl conditions in 27 States and  has caused crop production losses of  up to 50 and as much as 80 percent in  many areas. In my own State of Ar kansas, farm crop damage, because of  the drought could exceed $500 million.  For 3 years already, our Nation's  farmers-crippled by debt, suffocated  by surpluses, and faced with a shrink age  of  their markets-have  experi enced the reality of an economic de pression.  In this crisis situation, it is urgent  that we eliminate the delays that have  so of ten  impeded disaster assistance  under the Department of Agriculture's  programs.  Accordingly, tomorrow I will propose  amendments to the continuing appro priations  resolution  for  fiscal  1984  which would establish reasonable time  boundaries for the provision of relief  to afflicted States and counties.  I  invite  the attention of my col leagues to these amendments and to  the  reality of  the emergency which  they underscore.  A government serves the people best  when it acts expeditiously in the peo ple's best interest.  D 1210  THE COMMUNITY RENEWAL  EMPLOYMENT ACT  <Mr. BROWN of California asked  and was given permission  to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",1983
1174,497,18,Mr.  BROWN  of  California.," Mr.  Speaker, the national unemployment  figures have begun to decline in the  last few months as the economic re covery has been officially declared.  Any decline in unemployment should  be hailed as good news-as it most as suredly is-but let us look at the entire  picture. Nine months into the recov ery, unemployment is still worse than  at any other time since the Great De pression.  In my own district, unem ployment remains high with the July  figures  indicating that 11 percent of  the work force was unemployed-this  is a district which is expected to be the  fastest growing area  in  the country  during the 1980's. Nationwide, nearly  11 million people are still unemployed,  with many millions more either under employed or too discouraged  to look  for work.  Later today  the House will debate  the merits of the Community Renewal  Employment Act. Some will argue that  with  the  recovery underway such a  program is not needed. But the fact re mains that we are not yet down to pre recession unemployment  levels. The  fact remains that we continue to have  unemployment  rates not seen  since  the 1930's. The fact remains that since  fiscal year 1980 total spending on em ployment and training programs has  dropped from $10.3 billion to $5.2 bil lion in fiscal year 1983, a reduction of  50 percent in 3 years.  The Community Renewal Employ ment Act is still very much needed; it  is  long past the  time  to help  those  most severely hit by the longest, hard est recession in over 40 years-the un employed, minorities, and women.  to  fill  this  seeks  THE NATIONAL SECURITY  CREDIT SANCTIONS ACT OF 1983  <Mr. McCLOSKEY asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCLOSKEY. Mr.  Speaker,  today I am introducing the National  Security Credit Sanctions Act of 1983.  Commentators  running  the gamut  from George Will through Felix Roha tyn and Walter Mondale have com mented  that  in  the wake  of  the  Korean airliner travesty, there should  be more significant sanctions short of  all-out war.  This  legislation  void.  It also seeks to correct the anomaly  of hundreds of banking  institutions  making decisions  in  relation  to  the  Soviet bloc that undermine the mili tary, diplomatic, and economic securi ty of the Western alliance.  This bill will make illegal further ex tensions of credit by banking institu tions  in  this country  to  the Soviet  Union and other Communist nations  without specific and detailed approv als of the U.S. Government.  It calls  for  the Secretary of  the  Treasury to immediately formulate a  plan  to  purchase  all  outstanding  Soviet bloc loans in the United States  and  foreign nations-subject  to  ap proval of the Congress.  Perhaps such measures could give  the Soviets pause for thought about  the consequences of  future  actions.  The Soviets  could  take appropriate  measures  in numerous areas of con cern for us to prevent default.  I urge support of the Congress for  the National Security Credit Sanctions  Act of 1983.  SENIOR AMERICAN  EMPLOYMENT  <Mr. REID asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1175,497,18,Mr.  REID.," Mr.  Speaker,  it  has  become a widely accepted notion that  older people either want to quit work  or do not want to work at all. Yet, in  reality, most senior Americans seek  options  about work. These  options  would help them earn more money or  serve  as  volunteers  or  keep  them  active  in other meaningful and pro ductive ways.  Recently, the Select Committee on  Aging held hearings in my district, Las  Vegas, Nev., not to discuss traditional  issues related to aging, such as social  security,  housing  and  medicare.  .Rather, we  heard  testimony  about  senior employment.  It was more  than educational  to  learn  about  the  enthusiasm  and  energy these forgotten people have. It  was inspirational. We listened to sen iors who represent millions of people  with the ability and energy to make  vital contributions to their communi ties.  But  they  are  discriminated  against because of an arbitrary birth  date, a mere number on a calendar.  The benefits of reintroducing sen iors who want to work into the work place are unlimited. For the country  this senior employment would fortify  the economy and reduce the current  Federal outlay through social security.  For  the  individual  this employment  would  translate  into economic  inde pendence and renewed self-esteem.  IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1036, THE  COMMUNITY  RENEWAL  EM PLOYMENT ACT  <Mr. MITCHELL  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1983
1176,497,18,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, today  and  tomorrow we will consider  the  Community  Renewal  Employment  Act. The physical deprivation associat ed with unemployment is bad enough,  the loss of a standard of living, and so  forth; but it seems to me that the psy chological impact of unemployment is  even greater, the feeling of worthless ness, the feeling of hopelessness, the  feeling of despair.  In my State of Maryland, where the  unemployment rate has dropped state wide, more  than 10,000  people are  going  to  lose or have  lost  their ex tended unemployment  compensation  benefits.

1185,510,18,Mr. WHEAT.," Mr. Speaker, for the  purposes of debate only,  I yield 30  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  <Mr.  LATTA),  pending which  I  yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 302  is an open rule providing for 3 hours  of general debate to be divided equally  between the chairman and ranking mi nority member of the Committee on  Education and Labor. The rule makes  in order an amendment in the nature  of a substitute which is recommended  by the Committee on Education and  Labor and is now printed in the bill.  This amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be considered as origi nal  text for  the purpose of amend ment under  the 5-minute  rule. Fur thermore, the bill shall be considered  by  title  instead of by  section  for  amendment and each  title shall be  considered as having been read.  House Resolution 302  also waives  points of order agaisnt the bill for fail ure to comply with section 402(a) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  As you know, Mr. Speaker,  section  402Ca>  requires any authorization for  new  budget  authority  be  reported  before May 15 of the preceding fiscal  year. The waiver is necessary because  the bill becomes effective fiscal year  1983. Since the bill was not reported  by May 15, 1982,  it violates section  402<a> of the Budget Act.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the rule pro vides for one motion to recommit, with  or without instructions.  Mr. Speaker, the importance of H.R.  1036,  the Community Renewal Em ployment  Act,  cannot  be  overly  stressed. While some cite declining un employment figures as evidence that  the recession is over, the fact remains  that the unemployment level in this  country is abnormally high.  As of August of this year, the unem ployment rate in the Nation was 9.5  percent. That means that at least 10.7  million people in this country are out  of work. An additional 1.5 million had  ceased to look for work because of the  state of the Nation's job market.  Mr. Speaker, these figures  indicate  that for a significant numbr of Ameri cans, the economy has not recovered.  H.R. 1036, the Community Renewal  Employment Act, is a bill which would  aid  this Nations' unemployed  and  assist State and local governments in  constructing and rehabilitating public  facilities.  H.R. 1036 authorizes $5 billion for  this fiscal year and $9.2 billion for the  next fiscal year,  to be used  to pay  wages to individuals to work on public  works projects, repair public buildings,  staff day care centers and  improve  educational facilities.  It is estimated  that as many as 900,000 of the cur rently unemployed  could benefit  this legislation is enacted.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1036 is a responsi ble piece of legislation which seeks to  remedy some of  the problems  that  have resulted because of the current  recession. For many, it will provide an  opportunity which has been denied  them for too long-the oportunity to  work and provide for themselves and  their loved ones.  Therefore, I urge that we adopt the  rule so that we may expeditiously pro ceed to consideration of this important  piece of legislation.  ",1983
1186,510,18,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the bill which this rule  makes in order attempts to decrease  unemployment by throwing money at  the problem one more time.  This is the wrong approach for sev eral reasons.  First, any economic stimulation that  may  result from pouring billions of  dollars into the economy in the name  of  job creation will be more  than  offset by the economic drag created by  redistributing the dollars from the pri vate to the public sector.  Second, Mr. Speaker, public service  jobs were tried and failed under the  CETA program. The jobs were expenif  ",1983
1187,523,18,Mr. PACKARD.,"  I appreciate  that,  Mr. Chairman. My second question,  then, does the reverse also hold equal ly true? That is, shall communities in  which it is routine practice for State  and  local  governments  to  contract  with private companies or organiza tions for certain services, particularly  construction associated with repair or  rehabilitation of public  facilities, be  encouraged to continue their normal  practice of contracting with private  contractors for the provision of serv ices authorized under this bill?  ",1983
1188,523,18,Mr. HAWKINS.," Yes,  that  is our  intent and the intent of the bill. By  providing private employment oppor tunities,  the bill increases the likeli hood that unemployed workers have  the chance  for permanent, unsubsi dized employment with private firms,  which the distinguished gentleman al luded  to  in his earlier  remarks.  In  some instances, the cost of the service  or activity determines whether  it  is  performed by private contractors or  public employees. In other cases the  decision is based on the nature of the  activity or on provisions of State law.  In any situation, the committee does  not wish  to disrupt  the established  method  for  determining  how  the  project shall be performed for the pur poses of this measure.  ",1983
1189,523,18,Mr. PACKARD.," I thank the distin guished gentleman for his clarifying  remarks.  I,  too,  believe  that work  which has been contracted out should  continue in that manner, and that a  bill of this nature, which is addressing  the very pressing question of unem ployment, should not, as an unexpect ed result, put persons currently em ployed out of a job-be that job in the  private sector or in the public sector.  I appreciate again the comments of  the gentleman from California.  0 1500  ",1983
1190,523,18,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2¥2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  GRAY).  ",1983
1191,523,18,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
1192,523,18,Mr. GRAY., I yield to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania.  ,1983
1193,523,18,Mr. COYNE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of H.R. 1036, the Community Re newal Employment Act of 1983.  The  10.7 million Americans  now  searching for work would be the prin cipal  beneficiaries  of  this  overdue  measure, a bill which would create  jobs  for 500,000  in community  im provement projects and in the repair  of educational facilities in fiscal year  1984.  Let us keep in mind that the unem ployment rate, while slightly reduced  from that of a year ago, remains at  the highest  it has been  since  the  Great Depression. After 8 months of  recovery,  the unemployment rate  in  August of this year stood at 9.5 per cent. This is one-half of 1 percentage  point higher  than  in any  recession  since the 1930's.  The duration of unemployment for  millions of Americans  is  just as dis turbing as  the aggregate number of  jobless. In 1979 the average length of  unemployment was  10.8 weeks. By  July 1981 the average length of time  without work was 14 weeks. This  is  nearly double the amount of time one  went without work  in  1979.  La.st  month, roughly one out of four people  unemployed was without work  for  more than 6 months.  The Community Renewal Employ ment Act aims  to provide work  to  those  long-term  unemployed. Local  governments would  receive  funds  to  hire  those who have been without  work for at lea.st 15 of the pa.st 20  weeks.  The funds would be distributed in a  manner  to assure  that  those areas  with the highest unemployment would  receive the greatest share. Eighty per cent of the money would go to commu nity  improvement projects,  such as  renovation of public buildings, repair  of parks and playgrounds, rehabilita tion  of mass  transportation,  and  weatherization.  In  addition,  funds  under  this part of the bill,  title  II,  could assist emergency food and shel ter programs, public health, child care,  and library programs, and services for  the elderly and handicapped. The bulk  of the funds would go for wages and  salaries, with an allowance for up to 25  percent for materials,  tools, and ad ministrative expenses.  I am especially pleased that title III  of H.R. 1036 sets a.side 20 percent of  the funds authorized for jobs created  by the rehabilitation of school facili ties. I can assure my colleagues that  those funds will go to good use in the  city of Pittsburgh, where the average  age of our 90 public schools is 50 years.  The city has  targeted  three high  schools for renovation, on a staggered  basis, beginning in the spring of 1984.  The cost of  rP-novation of Schenley  High School, constructed in 1916, will  be $7.6 million. Renovation costs for  the North Side's Oliver High School,  built  in 1924, will be $11.3 million.  Squirrel Hill's 56-year-old Tayler-All derdice High School needs $10.8 mil lion in rehabilitation.  In each of these schools, vocational  and business areas will be modernized.  Where necessary, inadequate physical  education  facilities will be  replaced.  New roofs on Schenley and Oliver, and  new windows at Taylor-Allderice, will  reduce long-term energy costs.  The legislation now before us would  enable the city of Pittsburgh to co ordinate a locally initiated program, fiIt  nanced by a planned bond issue, with  a federally funded jobs program. This  is the type of partnership we should  encourage.  addresses  community  needs while putting the jobless back to  work.  At this point, I  think it is worth while to note that we will be putting  people back to work at a reasonable  cost  to  the  Federal Government.  While every job created through the  defense procurement process costs the  Treasury about $120,000 per job, and  each  public works  job  requires  a  $40,000  to $50,000 Federal commit ment, the average job created by H.R.  1036 will cost approximately $12,500.  By improving our communities while  helping someone out of work obtain a  useful  income, we  reap double divi dends on our Federal investment.  I urge a ""yes"" vote on the Communi ty Renewal Employment Act of 1983.  ",1983
1194,523,18,Mr. GRAY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of H.R. 1036.  There are a number of myths re garding the potential impact of this  proposal which I would like to address  at this time.  First,  this proposal will have  the  effect of reducing the overall Federal  deficit and not, as many purport, rais ing  that deficit. The Congressional  Budget Office has estimated that each  1 percent increase  in unemployment  adds between $26 to $40 billion to the  Federal  deficit.  This  proposal,  if  passed,  could  create  as many  as  500,000 new jobs for the unemployed,  having the effect of reducing the un employment rate from 9.5 percent to 9  percent.  I have estimated that the net effect  of removing the unemployed from the  Federal rolls and putting them on the  payrolls will more than offset the Fed eral  investment  envisioned  in H.R.  1036.  Second, there are many who argue  that H.R. 1036 is not needed because  the recent upturn in the economy will  create new job opportunities, thus al leviating unemployment-all we have  to do is wait. In response, however, the  economic recovery has not alleviated  the problems of the long-term unem ployed, and indeed there is universal  agreement within  -economic  circles  that the unemployment rate will con tinue to hover at or near 9 percent  throughout 1984 and beyond.  What are we to do, then? Wait for  the private sector and the long-await ed recovery? Even the administration's  own optimistic people say it will be  1986  before  unemployment  comes  down to the 1980 level of 7 .2 percent.  What,  I  ask, are people  to do? Are  they to wait? Are they to listen to us  say, just wait 3 years, we will find you  a job.  What are we to tell them, that we  have a great economic theory, that if  they just wait 3 years, and 1986 will  ",1983

1196,536,18,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to begin my remarks today,  if I can, in a fashion that I  think is  only proper for those of us who have  sat on the Subcommittee on Employ ment Opportunities, which has heard  all the debate regarding this bill. Re gardless whether one is for or against  this particular legislation, and reason able men and women can certainly  differ on this particular issue, I think  we would all be remiss if we did not  give a special debt of gratitude to the  distinguished chairman of our subcom mittee, the gentleman from California  <Mr.  HAWKINS)  and  the  ranking  member, the gentleman from Vermont  <Mr. JEFFORDS) for the long hours that  they have put into this particular leg islation.  As a member of that subcommittee,  I have sat through not hours, but days  and days of hearings on this particular  issue as we have brought in all kinds  of economists and  individuals  from  across  this country to discuss  really  what is going on in America industrial ly and economically and what ought to  be done to deal with this problem.  I would suggest that there is not a  Member among us  that  is not con cerned about  the unemployment  in  this country, and if there is one, they  ought not  to be a Member of  this  Chamber, I say quite simply and quite  frankly; but as we go through all those  hearings and as we have heard the dif ferent testimony that has occurred, I  think it is fair to say that we really  came to two conclusions.  The  first one was brought  forth  most eloquently by that MIT econo mist, Dr. Richard Thurow, who said,  The fact is, we are not in an American eco nomic shutdown, we are in a worldwide eco nomic shutdown.  No longer does the American econo my exist simply by itself, irrelevent or  not affected by what happens world wide, and I could go into the problems  with Japan, England, Germany and all  of our Western  industrialized coun tries, what they are feeling.  The second thing is I think all too  common to all Americans. It has been  brought forward by John Nesbitt in  his book,  ""Megatrons."" It has been  brought  forward by Lane Kirkland,  the head of the AFL-CIO. We are in a  changing industrial base in this coun try. Lane Kirkland of the AFL-CIO  said not too long ago that 25 percent  of the people who are unemployed in  this country will never get their jobs  back, regardless of what happens to  the economy, because unfortunately  that 25 percent has been replaced by  technology.  0 1620  So we need to begin this discussion  today and for the next couple of days  as we debate this legislation, exactly  where are we and where are we trying  to go, and how best can we put togeth er some kind of economic program,  jobs policy, training program, that will  get us where we want to go.  And I think that is how reasonable  men and women can differ on  the  merits or demerits of H.R. 1036 that is  in front of us.  I happen  to believe  this will not  solve  the problem. What my distin guished colleague on the committee,  Mr. OWENS,  just said,  is  just exactly  right, 500,000  jobs with 10.7 million  people unemployed does not solve the  problem. And we ought not try to tell  the American people that it is going  to. Worst of all, we ought not to try to  tell the unemployed that it is going to  do that for them, because too often  the reason that the Congress suffers  credibility in this country is we give  people impressions we are going to do  things we really cannot do or are not  able to do.  We are going to spend $5 billion, $3.5  billion, if the amendment is adopted,  and this combined with a  jobs bill of  $4.6 billion that we passed earlier will  give us an expenditure of about $8 bil lion in this area.  The two of them will employ about  800,000 people in temporary jobs. The  problem  is what do we do with the  other 10 million people unemployed in  this country and what do we do with  the 800,000 people once their year is  up.  It seems to me when we talk about  some kind of an industrial jobs policy  in this country, that there are a couple  of things we need to keep  in mind.  Most important is, as you talk to every  individual  and  every  labor  union,  every unemployment line in this coun try,  they do not want a permanent  public  sector  job. The  fact of  the  matter is most of those people do not  like us in Government very well. What  they want  is  a  permanent private  sector job, and exactly how do we get  that? The way we get that is from  training, and I stand here to tell you I  will vote for more job training funds,  and we are going to in an appropria tion bill later this week appropriate  about $6.4 billion for the Job Training  Partnership Act,  going  to  increase  funding for vocational adult education  to over $800 million. And I think that  kind of funding is going to be absolute ly necessary.  But we need to ask ourselves today  as we debate this bill in general debate  before we get to the amendments, re gardless of the economic policy, and I  think we can debate  that pros and  cons as it is affecting the deficit, but  to  in  terms of putting people back  work in America how do you do it.  First  and  foremost  you  have  to  expend the money on training. The av erage person who graduates from high  school today is going to have four dif ferent careers in their lifetime. We are  going to have to put into place in this  country the most massive adult train ing and  retraining program we  can  ever imagine. And is it going to cost  money? Yes, it is going to cost a lot of  money. It is going to cost the Federal  Government money. We  better  be  ready to pay for that.  In  addition,  beyond  training,  the  second most preferable way  to deal  with people in putting them to work is  in some kind of a public works project  where you have something to show for  it. That is what the $4.6 billion biparti san public works program was  last  spring. That is what the Public Works  and Transportation Committee is call ing for in their $3.6 billion phase II  jobs bill. That ought to be our second  preference.  Only at the end should we look and  even consider something like we are  looking at today which is some type of  tempo'rary assistance with no training  and no future. That my  friends by  itself  is  the greatest disservice, not  service, we can give to 10 to 11 million  unemployed in this country.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983

1198,536,18,Mr. CORRADA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of H.R. 1036, the Com munity Renewal  Employment Act,  which would create  jobs for  individ uals who have been unemployed 15  weeks or more, with preference going  to unemployment  insurance exhaus tees. This bill represents the second  portion of a plan to stabilize the econ omy and to revitalize the employment  sector by providing opportunities  in  activities which benefit the communi ty as well as the individual.  Mr. Chairman, no survey or poll is  necessary to tell us that one of the  most serious problems in the minds of  Americans today is unemployment.  We all know the numbers, and a re capitulation of  the statistics at  this  point would be almost redundant. We  all are too well aware that unemploy ment has climbed to a heartbreaking  rate of 9.4 percent and that more than  10 million people are officially counted  as jobless-and more than 4 million of  them have been out of work for more  than 15 weeks.  While  the  average unemployment  rate is unacceptably high, it is a poor  indication of the true status of certain  groups, such as blacks, Hispanics, and  youth.  August  figures  show  that  790,000 Hispanics, or 12.9 percent out  of a total work force of 6,124,000 are  out of work,  as are  20  percent of  ",1983
1199,549,18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from New Jersey <Mr. DWYER)  is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. DWYER of New Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, it is with a deep sense of sad ness that I  join today in this special  order  honoring  the  269  innocent  people who lost their lives on Korean  Air Lines flight 007.  Much has already been said about  this total act of barbarism on the part  of the Soviet Union, and we are sure  to hear more as the debate on the forinci eign policy  implications of this  dent continues.  It is an essential debate that must be  carried out fully, openly and with dili gence to uncover every detail possible  in an all-out effort  to prevent  this  international atrocity from recurring.  Throughout  this debate, however,  we must never lose sight of the fact  that the central issue is the loss of in nocent, civilian lives. Sixty of these in dividuals were American citizens. I am  sorry to report that one young man  was from my own congressional dis trict,  and  several other  passengers  were  residents of  the State of New  Jersey. I join my colleagues in extend ing my most heartfelt sympathies to  the survivors of all the passengers and  crew members on KAL flight 007.  The resolution passed by this Cham ber last week is an important first step  in expressing our outrage. We owe it  to the victims' families and to the vic tims themselves to remain steadfast in  our determination to make the Soviets  fully accountable for their act of ter rorism.  The tragedy of the downing of KAL  flight 007 will remain with us for a  long time, and that is as it should be.  We must actively search for the truth  surrounding this incident and seek ef fective  international  responses  on  many fronts.  To help guide us in this quest, we  can be inspired by the KAL passengers  and crew members, who will stand for ever as  international symbols of the  humanity we  strive  to protect  in a  world marked by the forces of peace  and reason than by the inhumane ac tions of totalitarian regimes.e  THE  NEED  FOR  PERSONAL  EMERGENCY  RESPONSE  SYS TEMS  FOR  THE  SEVERELY  FUNCTIONALLY IMPAIRED  ",1983
1200,549,18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Florida <Mr. PEPPER)  is  recognized for 5 minutes.e  ",1983
1201,549,18,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  very pleased to introduce today, with  my distinguished colleague from Ten nessee <Mr. QUILLEN), a bill that will  provide medicare (part B> and optional  medicaid coverage of personal emer gency response services for the severe ly functionally  impaired. This bill is  similar to a bill I introduced last ses sion with  the Honorable Margaret  Heckler, now Secretary of the Depart ment of Health and Human Services. I  believe this legislation takes an impor tant step  toward  the prevention of  premature institutionalization while at  the same time providing savings to the  Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker,  the rapid growth of  Federal expenditures for institutional  health care  increasingly has led the  health-care community and Congress  to consider in-home and communitybased alternatives  to nursing homes  and hospitals that would be less ex pensive while at the same time better  meet the needs of health-care recipi ents.  Personal  emergency  response  services represent precisely the kind of  alternative care that can help improve  the quality of life for the elderly and  disabled while  reducing  the overall  costs of long-term care. My bill will  off er the Federal Government the op portunity to participate with the pri vate sector in supporting these serv ices for those most at risk of institu tionalization.  Indeed,  through  this  support, the Federal Government has  the proven potential to avoid the sig nificantly  higher  institutional  and  other health-care costs it would other wise incur on behalf of these serVice  recipients. Thus, we have the rare op portunity  of  helping  people  and  having a positive impact on the Feder al budget at the same time.  The essential purpose of personal  emergency  response  services  is  to  permit  an  individual  at  home  to  summon assistance  automatically  in  the event of a medical or environmen tal emergency. The utility of such a  service is clear. Elderly or disabled per sons with physical or mental infirmi ties but no need for around-the-clock  care frequently enter nursing homes  simply to insure 24-hour monitoring in  the event an emergency should arise.  A personal-emergency-response service  can permit these individuals to remain  independent and  in  the community,  secure  in the knowledge that assist ance can be summoned by the push of  a button. If used as part of hospital  discharge planning,  the  service  can  also facilitate a patient's early return  home.  A  recently completed study  spon sored  by  the National Center  for  Health Services Research <NCHSR>  strongly supports the conclusion that  personal emergency response services  can assist the elderly and disabled to  remain  independent  in  their  own  homes while reducing the incidence of  institutionalization and creating sig nificant savings  in health-care costs  for the severely functionally impaired.  The study, conducted by Drs. Syliva  Sherwood and  John Morris of  the  Hebrew  Rehabilitation  Center  for  Aged in Boston, evaluated the effects  of a particular personal emergency re sponse system known as lifeline. The  lifeline  system allows clients  to  re quest aid by simply pressing a button  on a portable pocket-sized unit; if the  person  is  unconscious,  the  system  senses the inactivity over a period of  time and signals for help automatical ly.  In greater detail, the lifeline system  tested by the study works as follows:  The  personal-emergency-response  service client normally carries a minia ture wireless call button that can be  ",1983
1202,588,18,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the Bumpers amendment  which would restrict coal leasing until  the Congress has a chance to review  the recommendations of the Linowes  Commission on Fair Trade Value.  Coming from a major coal-producing  State, I know full well the importance  of coal to our economic vitality. Indus try access to the billions of tons of fed erally owned reserves located in the  West may prove eventually to be cru cial to our long-term energy policy ob jectives. However, unlike the present  administration, and in particular Sec retary Watt, I sincerely believe that  we can lease and mine coal consistent  with maintaining stringent protections  to safeguard our citizens and our envi ronment.  Prudent management of these plen tiful reserves is essential. Blind adher ence to ideological purity for the sake  of expediency and  in  the name of  public policy too often entails sacrific ing elements of  the public welfare.  This  is exactly what we have wit nessed as a result of Secretary Watt's  determination to sell an unprecedent ed amount of public  lands at ""fire  sale"" rates.  Earlier  this year,  the General Ac counting Office estimated that the De partment of Interior's Powder River  basin coal lease sale, at prices lower  than the fair market value, cost the  public over $100 million. Even more  disturbing, there have been allegations  that Department of the Interior offi cials intentionally engaged in activities  designed  to  tilt  the  leasing process  toward a handful of favored bidders.  These charges must be fully  investi gated and the necessary reforms made  in the coal leasing program to insure  proper,  impartial management  that  will obtain the full, fair return for our  Nation's valuable resources. I  find it  ironic that this administration, which  strongly proclaims its faithfulness to  the free market system, has attempted  to impede the workings of the market place.  There are, at present, over 18 billion  tons of recoverable Federal coal under  lease-175 years supply at current pro duction rates. In fiscal year 1981, only  104 million tons of coal were produced  from  these  leases. Moreover, out of  the 616 existing Federal coal leases in  fiscal year 1981, only 105 produced  coal.  Indeed,  there  certainly  is  no  ""coal rush"" on. Just last week,  in a  highly controversial sale centered on  the  Fort Union  region  in North  Dakota and Montana, the Interior De partment sold only 114 million tons of  Federal coal leases out of a possible  542 million tons.  Given these facts, it is now time to  impose a  temporary moratorium on  these sales until the advisory commit tee's  recommendations  can  be  re viewed by Congress. It is in the best  interests of our Nation, from an eco nomic,  environmental,  and  energy  standpoint to establish effective safe guards  in  the coal  leasing program.  Prudent management is absolutely es sential to restore public confidence in  this program. In my judgment, leasing  should only proceed when the value of  the resources clearly outweighs the es timated environmental damages,  in cluding the damage  to wildlife  that  might result from development. Proce dures must be followed to insure that  the Government, as required by law,  receives a fair market value. And final ly,  strict  environmental  protections  must be afforded when exploration or  production occur.  It is for these reasons that I support  the Bumpers amendment and urge my  colleagues to accept it.e   ",1983
1203,588,18,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, the  administration has proposed  leasing  up  to 16 billion  tons of coal  in the  United States by 1985, part of a plan  to accelerate energy development on  public lands. In New Mexico, the De partment of the Interior is planning to  lease 3 billion tons of San Juan Basin  coal in the northwestern part of the  State.  Considerable  controversy has  sur rounded this planned leasing program  especially since a  review of the first  major sale  last year  in  the Powder  River basin of Wyoming raised signifi cant problems with the process. This  controversy continues with the recent  Fort Union sale that drew low bids and  few bidders.  The major issue in dispute is in pro viding  an  adequate  return  to  the  public for the release of these public  resources at this time.  Fair market value  for coal  is  the  process by which the Department of  the Interior estimates the value of a  coal lease and/ or assesses whether a  given high bid offered for the lease is  adequate. This is not an easy task, es pecially when coal is sold in a market  that has experienced decades of non competitive  leasing  and  speculation  and where current land use and coal  activity processes may not match the  Government's leasing needs.  The amendment we consider today  will suspend, temporarily, further Fed eral coal  leasing pending  review by  Congress of the recommendations of  the Commission on Fair Market Value  Policy for Federal Coal Leasing, estab lished to review the procedures under  which the program is conducted, espe cially the issue of fair market value.  The public deserves fair and equita ble  remuneration for  the use of  its  ",1983
1204,601,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Idaho.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr.  President,  I  think there is reason to try to expedite  the passage of this bill. We had earlier  said to Members that we had thought  we  could  complete  this  bill  by  6  o'clock. I remind Members that there  are  some dozen other amendments  that have to be disposed of yet this  evening.  I shall attempt to expedite  each of those. The rest will not, of  course, take very much time individ ually. They can be disposed of expedi tiously.  I  know of only one other  amendment that has the potential for  requiring any extended debate or a  rollcall vote. I hope that is the way it  develops.  We still have hopes of completing  this bill on or near that schedule. It is  still my intention and hope that we  can do that.  Allow me for just a few minutes, Mr.  President, to put into perspective some  of  the  arguments  that have  been  made.  I hear various Members saying we  must pass the amendment because we  have to have an insurance policy. The  question is not whether we have an in surance policy;  the question  is how  large are the benefits and what is the  premium? We  have  an  insurance  policy in a strategic petroleum reserve  and we are paying a premium for that  coverage.  I would say again, in the same analo gy to an insurance policy, our emer gency capacity to respond is part of  the coverage of that insurance policy.  And we are broadening the coverage of  this policy by other actions which the  administration has agreed to take as  we balance this particular part of the  coverage against other parts of  the  coverage against emergency.  It has been suggested that indeed,  there is increased danger that the hos tilities in the Middle East may spread  in such a fashion as to interrupt the  supply of oil. It is expressed in terms  of urgency: This is something that is  new and it is different;  therefore, it  may happen almost any time. Indeed,  that is perhaps true. But let us put  that into perspective.  The difference between a fill rate of  145,000 barrels a day and 220,000 bar rels a day  is  the difference between  the end of 1984 of having in the stra tegic reserve 411 million barrels of oil  or 439 million barrels of oil-measura ble, important, but not earth shaking  by itself. If we look at it in the time frame of the urgency of the current  critical conditions in the Middle East,  indeed, it washes out. As a matter of  fact, it is less significant if you look at  what the administration has agreed to  do with respect to the balanced pack age which we have tried to put togeth er and of which this is just a part.  I hope that Members remember-I  certainly do-the struggles we have  had in the past to try to forge emer gency responses. We passed a Standby  Petroleum Allocation Act  that was  hard fought. I was a sponsor of that  act; I fought for it; I argued with the  administration about it. We lost that  argument. The President vetoed  the  bill and that veto was sustained by  Congress. I suggest to my colleagues,  too, that what we got back as a part of  the overall package of coverage under  this insurance policy we call emergen cy response is a significant gain from  where we were at the time of the veto  of that particular measure. So we have  made some progress, we in the Con gress and in the administration, work ing together.  I cannot help but think, as the Sena tor from New Mexico <Mr. DoMENICI)  was talking about: Have we gotten to  the point where a billion dollars does  not make any difference anymore? We  are talking about $1.4 billion in budget  authority. Not the appropriations or  outlays, but $1.4 billion in budget au thority. That is what we will be meas ured against. It is there, at that point,  that the Office of Management and  Budget will make a  recommendation  to the President with respect to a veto.  I stress, too, and I do not mean to  overstress this, but I think it is impor tant for us to remember that every  dollar we add by way of amendment  here puts stress on every other appro priation in this bill. I say to Members  on both sides of the aisle, no threats  involved but just realism, if you add $1  billion or $1.4 billion in budget author ity here what do I do to try to get that  bill down to a size the President will  sign? I start looking around at other  things that we can pare out of it. So if  you have any favorite things in this  bill,  you had better  look  carefully  ",1983
1205,614,18,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, this  amendment for a half million dollars  sets a kind of precedent which involves  sort of an open-door invitation to get  the Federal Government  to pay for  the attorneys' fees. It is a tough prece dent to establish.  There are 52  cases pending  right  now in 10 different States. I recall in  1972, 1973, or 1974 when the northern  Cheyenne case was started in Mon tana; 4 of 500-maybe 600 or 700-indi viduals, non-Indians, were made part  of the case. They were served with  summonses and answered. It was with  respect to a claim about water.  This  is not  the only one  in New  Mexico. There  are  others  in New  Mexico. What is being described as a  New Mexico case is not different from  that in other States or different from  other cases in New Mexico.  There is only one reason to raise a  point of order, and that is just to keep  this in the proper sequence and to em phasize that it is setting a precedent,  and probably a dangerous precedent,  for the Government to be paying the  lawyers on both sides of a case, in a  case in which the Government is in volved,  in representing the trust re sponsibility of the tribes.  I do not know what the Indian tribes  think about this, but that is beside the  point. It is what Congress-the Senate  and the House-thinks about it.  The real situation we are facing here  is that if the Senate finds that the lan guage in the amendment is germane,  we are nowhere anyway. We still have  to debate the amendment, because it is  a question of whether or not  it  is  proper to add the language, the last  five or six lines at the tail end of this  section that is already in the bill. So  we will be in the situation of debating  the amendment until we are satisfied  that we have done our utmost on it.  The amendment will be subject to a  tabling motion, for example. If the ta bling motion is agreed to, does that  strike the language dealing with $53  million for higher education, scholar ships, and assistance to public schools  under the act of April 16, 1934? No. If  the tabling motion is successful, that  language will  remain in the bill be cause it is in the bill.  So what are we doing here? We do  not get away from the issue of wheth er or not this was offered for just the  last five or six lines, the precedent-set ting lines. We are not getting away  from anything.  I  think  the  regular  procedures should be followed.  Therefore, Mr. President, I raise the  point of order under rule XVI against  the amendment.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  I  raise the question of germaneness, and  I ask for the yeas and nays.  ",1983

1216,627,18,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  I ask  the  Senator  from  Idaho  <Mr.  McCLURE) if he would consider recom mending  to  the conferees  the  rein statement of funding for the Tisho mingo Fish Hatchery, by accepting the  House position  in  the  joint House Senate conference committee on H.R.  3363.  As he may be aware, full funding of  $190,000 was provided for this facility  in the House version. The House com mittee was persuaded  that  this 55year-old facility is an important part  of our Nation's fish and wildlife pro gram and is an integral part of the  local  economy of  Johnston County  and southern Oklahoma.  I understand that due to the length  of service of this facility that substan tial repairs will need to be made in the  future to bring this facility back up to  par with other facilities. But, I believe  that the importance of this hatchery  is certainly worth the financial com mitment and that retention of this fa cility is fully justified.  ",1983
1217,627,18,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, will  my good friend from Oklahoma yield?  ",1983
1218,627,18,Mr. BOREN., I am happy to yield to  my colleague.  ,1983
1219,627,18,Mr. NICKLES.," I should like to echo  the Senator's request  to Chairman  McCLURE that funding for the Tisho mingo National Fish Hatchery be ac cepted by the conferees on H.R. 3363.  I point out that this one hatchery  alone supplied over 1.8 million fish in  1982 to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colo rado, and Texas. It also supplies eggs  and fry for research purposes to Co lumbia, Mo., Brigham Young Universi ty in Utah, and Stuttgart, Ark. And it  was this facility that pioneered the de velopment of mechanical hatching of  small mouth bass and channel catfish,  methods now being used by other  hatcheries all across the country.  It  is also  important  to note  that  southern Oklahoma  and  Johnston  County have an unemployment rate  well in excess of the national average.  This facility employs 10 full-time staff  as well as high school students in the  summer. And it is an important educa tional facility used by public school  groups, Boy Scout  troops,  and  the  local college.  For these reasons, I urge our distin guished chairman to retain this facili ty when  the  conference  committee  meets to iron out differences on H.R.  3363.  Mr. McCLURE.  I  appreciate  the  comments  of  both  Senators  from  Oklahoma  in support of  the Tisho mingo National  Fish Hatchery  in  Johnston County, Okla.  The committee considered a number  of  criteria  in  developing  a  list  of  hatcheries to recommend for closure.  Primarily, it considered the reason for  the initial establishment of the hatch ery; the distribution of the fish pro duced by these hatcheries into Feder al, State, or private waters; the pur pose for the Federal use of fish pro duced; and the future  rehabilitation  costs of the hatchery.  As both Senators know,  I am not  prepared at  this  time  to accept an  amendment on the Senate floor which  would  retain money  for  the Tisho mingo Hatchery. However, I am aware  of  the  importance of  this hatchery  from your comments and I will urge  the conferees to give this matter very  serious consideration when  it comes  before the joint House-Senate confer ence.

1220,627,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I join the  distinguished Senator from Oklahoma  <Mr. BOREN) in his remarks in support  of the Tishomingo Fish Hatchery, lo cated in southeastern Oklahoma. As  he has pointed out, the facility has op erated  for  55  years  in  Johnston  County, Okla.  I speak with firsthand knowledge of  the importance of fish hatcheries to  local economies, having been deeply  involved with similar facilities in West  Virginia. I hope that when H.R. 3363  reaches the conference committee, the  conferees on the part of the Senate  will recede to the House position on  this matter, which provides for fund ing of $190,000 for fiscal 1984 for the  Tishomingo Fish Hatchery.

1221,627,18,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I thank  the distinguished Democratic  leader  and ranking member of the subcom mittee for his remarks and especially  for his support of our efforts to keep  open the Tishomingo Fish Hatchery.  His support is welcome and will be of  great help.  KETTLE FALLS HOTEL  ",1983
1222,627,18,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  rise to discuss with my colleague from  Minnesota, Senator DURENBERGER, and  with the chairman of the Interior Ap propriations Subcommittee, Senator  McCLURE, a very serious problem that  exists  in northern Minnesota. The  problem  is  the deterioration of  the  Kettle Falls Hotel in Voyageurs Na tional Park.  The hotel is located on the Minneso ta-Canada border  in Voyageurs Na tional Park. It was built in 1913 and  was owned and operated by the Wil liams family from 1918 until it was  purchased by the National Park Serv ice in 1977. The Williams family still  operates the hotel under a concessions  agreement with  the National Park  Service.  The hotel is a major attraction in  Voyageurs National Park, however, it  is deteriorating rapidly and in desper ate need of repair. There is a serious  question as to whether the hotel can  even operate next year under these  conditions. When the Williams family  sold the hotel to the Park Service, it  was on the condition that the hotel  would be preserved and maintained.  The  current  problems with  this  hotel are very serious. The boom logs  that serve as the hotel's only f ounda tion are nearly rotted away. This has  caused the outside walls to sink, which  in turn has caused the floor to buckle  throughout  the hotel. Literally,  the  hotel is falling apart. It is extremely  important that the Park Service act  quickly  to make  improvements. The  Park Service currently has a planning  study  underway  to  determine  the  extent of rehabilitation necessary.  We  had  considered  offering  an  amendment today to increase funding  for  the National Park Service  to be  used to rehabilitate the hotel. Howev er, because the chairman has reserva tions about such an amendment, at  least until the planning is complete,  we have decided not to offer such an  amendment.  Mr. President,  I  yield  league from Minnesota.  ",1983
1223,627,18,Mr. DURENBERGER., I  thank my  colleague for yielding and for describ ing  the problem we  face with  the  Kettle Falls Hotel. This hotel is an im portant resource to Voyageurs Nation al Park and to northern Minnesota.  to my col ,1983

A bill for the relief of the  survivors of John Smitherman; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.  RELIEF OF THE SURVIVORS OF JOHN  SMITHERMAN  ",1983
1225,640,18,Mr.  SASSER.," Mr. President, along  with  the  distinguished  majority  leader, Mr. BAKER,  I am today intro ducing legislation for the relief of the  survivors of John Smitherman of Mul berry, Tenn.  John Smitherman passed away this  past Sunday without the service-con nected compensation from the Veter ans' Administration that was his just  reward  for  the service he gave his  country. Now, his widow, Rose Smith erman,  is without support, and  this  bill seeks to correct this injustice.  The case of John Smitherman is a  tragic saga that goes back to his serv ice in the Navy in the South Pacific  just after World War II. At that time  he witnessed an atmospheric atomic  test. Then, only hours later, his ship  sailed into the very spot of the test  site. After  several  hours  of work  around  the  site,  John Smitherman  took the most unfortunate swim of his  life in water that had just been con taminated by atomic radiation. During  the entire exercise, John Smitherman  and his colleagues received no warnings from Navy officials about the haz ards of radiation.  Today, if one is near low level radi ation, one must wear extensive protec tive clothing: John Smitherman wore  only shorts the day he witnessed an  atomic bomb blast.  Despite the fact that John Smither man lost two legs to this cancer, the  Veterans' Administration continued to  insist that his disease was not service connected.  Despite all  the evidence  that  the  cancer which  slowly  consumed him  and eventually caused his death  is  linked to the radiation exposure, the  Veterans' Administration remained ad amant in its refusal to grant service connected compensation.  John Smitherman made seven ap peals to the Veterans' Administration,  each  one  unsuccessful,  each  one  bogged down by a  technicality. This  case is a bureaucratic nightmare. This  case is a classic example of Govern ment insensitivity to its citizens.  John Smitherman served his coun try proudly and even while lying on  his deathbed because of a disease ac quired while in his country's service,  insisted, without hesitation,  that he  would serve his country again.  I hope that my colleagues will act fa vorably and expeditiously on this leg islation.  I ask unanimous consent that recent  editorials from the Nashville Banner  and  Tennessean  regarding  John  Smitherman be printed in the RECORD  at this point.  There being no objection, the mate rials were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CFrom the Nashville Banner, Sept. 15, 19831  JOHN SMITHERMAN'S FIGHT GOES ON  John Smitherman, a 55-year-old Lincoln  County man, was serving his country in the  Navy during the days after World War II  when  testing of  this nation's new-found  atomic power was being tested in remote  Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. Mr. Smitherman  was there when an atomic bomb was tested  in 1946, and for  the past seven years he  vainly sought benefits from the government  in the form of disability pay.  Mr. Smitherman suffered from lymphatic  cancer that cost him his legs and caused one  hand to swell abnormally. The cancer, he  said, was a result of the atomic testing to  which he was exposed. Mr. Smitherman  continued his fight until  the day of his  death last Sunday, not only for himself, but  in behalf of the thousands of members of  the National Association of Atomic Veter ans, an organization of which he was chair man. There have been nearly 3,000 claims  by veterans and  their families of atomic  testing induced illness. Sixteen have been  granted. Mr. Smitherman's was not one of  them.  In his stead, members of Tennessee's con gressional delegation are carrying on the  fight.  ""He knew he could count on his  friends to continue fighting for him, and we  will,"" said Rep. Jim Cooper. ""John Smither man knew that his time was short but his  thoughts were not of himself,"" Sen. Jim  ",1983
1226,653,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I am con cerned that the administration may be  moving too rapidly in the direction of  decontrolling trade in sensitive goods  and high technology with the People's  Republic of China. Many questions  remain  to be  answered before  any  trade relaxation should take place, not  the least of which is the quid pro quo.  Will relaxation of  trade result  in a  more  friendly  relationship with  the  PRC? Will they renounce the use of  force in any efforts toward reunifica tion with Taiwan? Will there be any  progress  toward human rights? Will  the PRC Government agree  to  the  provisions of the Nuclear Nonprolif eration Treaty, or will our high tech  exports enhance the ability of the Chi nese  to employ nuclear weapons, or  otherwise threaten the security of our  friends  in the region? What reliable  guarantees do we have that the Chi nese will not retransf er American high  technology to the Soviets in exchange  for concessions or to play the United  States  and  the  Soviet Union  off  against one another?  Mr. President,  it may  interest my  colleagues  to know  that  the Soviet  heat seeking missile that downed the  Korean Air Lines plane was probably a  copy of our own sidewinder missile  based in large part on U.S. technology.  How do we know that with regard to  the Chinese we will not repeat our ex perience with  the Soviet Union and  come to experience the use of our own  technology against us? The PRC does  not seem to have air defense proce dures that are much of an improve ment on the Soviet system, and they  glaringly abstained in the United Na tions on  the  resolution condemning  the Soviet action.  Mr. President,  these questions are  today unanswered, and as they remain  so I think that it is premature to take  any  drastic  steps  to  facilitate  the  export of sensitive goods and technolo gy to the People's Republic of China,  lest we come  to  rue  this action 10  years later as we have with regard to  the Soviet Union.e  HUSTLER-BACK TO THE  GUTTER  e ",1983
1227,653,18,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  have asked for a few minutes to clear  the air due  to a certain publication  sent to me as well as many of you.  Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler  magazine, a well-known, hard core por nographic magazine, has sent me a  complimentary subscription.  While I do not mean to give him any  more publicity  than he already  re ceives, I do not want him or any of my  family,  friends  or  constituents  to  think that I accept his publication. I  believe that any type of literature one  enjoys should impart some form of lit erate information. Unfortunately, the  information one would  receive  from  this publication is that which belongs  where it was conceived-the gutter.  Mr. President, thank you for allow ing me the time and I now tum the  floor back  to more pressing Senate  Business.e  HISTORIC, LONG DISTANCE  FLIGHT BY B-29 TRI  e ",1983
1228,653,18,Mr.  SASSER.," Mr.  President,  38  years ago this week, just after Japan  surrendered in World War II, three B29 crews made the first nonstop flight  from Japan to Chicago, where they re fueled, and then to Washington, D.C.  The  crews were  selected  by Gen.  Curtis LeMay, and the general's plane  was piloted by my good friend from  Shelbyville, Tenn., J.  Ivan Potts. It  was truly an historic trip-a nonstop  6,509 miles.  Ivan Pots was a World War II pilot  with the 40th Bomb Group, one of the  most decorated units in the war in the  Far East. The 40th Group  in 1944  made the first strikes on the Japanese  homeland  except  for  the Doolittle  Raids of 1942. The 40th Group flew 70  missions against Japan out of India,  China and Tinian for which they re ceived three Presidential citations and  eight campaign battle stars. Ivan him self flew eight transport missions from  India to China across the Hump in the  Himalayas, and compiled 525 combat  hours,  including 35 combat missions  against Japan. He has been awarded  two Distinguished Flying Crosses, four  Air Medals, two Presidential Unit cita tions, the Army Commendation Medal  and many others. He is today a colonel  in the Tennessee Air National Guard.  The September  issue of Air Force  magazine includes an article Ivan has  written to recount the exploits of the  nonstop flight 38 years ago, and I am  sure there will be many fond recollec tions among  those who gather  this  week in Dayton, Ohio, the veterans of  the 40th Bomb Group. Our Nation  sends its congratulations and its grati tude to Ivan and to others of the 40th  Group for their splendid record in a  time of great peril  for  the United  States.  Mr. President,  in  tribute  to  these  brave men, and without objection,  I  should like to insert in the RECORD at  this time Ivan Potts' account of the  historic nonstop flight from Japan of  the  three B-29's of  the 40th Bomb  Group. I wish them many more happy  reunions.  The article follows:  AF AER TELLS STORY OF HISTORIC, LoNG0ISTANCE FLIGHT BY B-29 TRIO  This September marks the thirty-eighth  anniversary of a  significant  long-distance  flight by three B-29 crews of Twentieth Air  Force. That was  the nonstop flight from  Hokkaido  in northern Japan  to Chicago,  where the aircraft landed on September 19,  1945.  Highlights of the mission are told by J.  Ivan Potts, Jr., an AFA member from Shel byville, Tenn., then a lieutenant and pilot of  the number two airplane. The mission was  led by Lt. Gen. Barney Giles, Deputy Com mander of  the US Army Strategic Air  Forces in the Pacific. He flew aboard the  number one aircraft. Number three aircraft  carried Brig. Gen. Emmett O'Donnell, then  Commander of the 73d Bomb Wing, and its  crew. Ivan Potts and the crew of number  two were led by Maj. Gen. Curtis E. LeMay,  then Chief of Staff of the US Army Strate gic Air Forces in the Pacific.

1229,679,18,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most troubling issues our society  faces today, and one we will continue  to face, is how to allocate our scarce  medical  resources. Today, we  spend  over 10 percent of our gross national  product on medical and health ex penses. It would not be hard, doctors  and hospital administrators tell us, to  spend 20 percent, 40 percent, or some  other astronomical level. The question  has to be answered, however, on how  much can we afford.  Whether we realize  it or not, that  question-how much resources do we  dedicate to health and medical care-is  being answered every day. The answer  may come on an ad hoc basis, may be  implicit, but it is nonetheless forceful.  If we want to be fair to all citizens, if  we want to have some control over our  expenditures, for health and medical  resources,  then we must  begin  to  answer  the  question  in  a  positive  manner.  Recently, Daniel Callahan addressed  the conference, ""Limited Health Care  Resources: Ethical Implications of Our  Choices,""  sponsored by  the Health  Planning Council for Greater Boston  on May 17, 1983. Dr. Callahan is direc tor and cofounder of  the Hastings  Center  Institute of Society, Ethics,  and the Life Sciences, Hastings-on-the Hudson, NY. As Dr. Callahan states:  ""There does not now exist, nor is there  ever likely to exist, a simple moral for mula that will tell us how to ration re sources        however        we can  morally frame the allocation problems  in a way that will maximize the possi bility of doing the morally best thing.""  I submit the first half of the address  for your consideration:  LIMITED HEALTH CARE RESOURCES: ETHICAL  IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CHOICES  <By Daniel Callahan, Ph.D.)  The topic of my talk is one of the most  difficult of all,  I  think,  in contemporary  medicine, and perhaps in contemporary do mestic policy. In talking about the alloca tion of health resources, we are dealing with  a historically unique human situation. One  can hardly expect to find ready solutions to  a problem of that magnitude, or one so new.  In fact, it is going to take some decades to  work ""things through. I would like to be able  to provide you with some simple solutions,  but I cailnot do that. What I would like to  do, J:lowever, is to giv_e you my own sense of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  how  the subject matter might be under stood. First, I want to give you some sense  of my interpretation of the historical back ground of  the present set of problems.  Second,  I want  to  suggest some general  moral guidelines that I think might be help ful  in trying to understand the problems.  Then, finally, I would like to say something  about how one might apply those guidelines  to a sample of pressing contemporary policy  decisions.  Beginning approximately with the Second  World War, mankind made an enormous  discovery. If enough research money were  spent, and if enough resources were devoted  to medical  care delivery,  the health of  human beings could be radically improved.  Indeed, human illness, which previous gen erations had accepted as a matter of fate,  was now seen to be under potential human  control. I choose the Second World War as  dividing line because it marked that point in  history when the governments of developed  countries, particularly the United States, re alized  that  large economic  investment  in  biomedical research could reap major bene fits. Thus in the years shortly after the war  the National Institutes of Health  in this  country was developed as a major research  agency, with hundreds of millions of dollars  invested each year in support of basic re search and of its clinical applications. Once  it was  realized  that such an  investment  could provide  enormous  social benefits that money could make the difference be tween life and death-it was only a short  step to the development of the Medicare  and Medicaid programs during the sixties,  and to the emergence of a debate over a  right to health care and the desirability of  national health insurance.  The early decades of that development  were marked by hope and optimism. Given  enough  investment of  time, money,  and  energy, no utopian fantasy seemed too out landish. The average human lifespan could  be significantly extended, the number and  quality of children could be controlled, the  ill could be made well, pain and suffering  could be radically reduced, and what had  hitherto seemed out of human control-the  body and  its  limitations-brought within  the framework of human choice and manip ulation. No sooner had biomedical research  conquered one frontier, than another beck oned for attention. The future seemed un limited in its possibilities.  In the moral realm, those were decades of  considerable optimism as well. While our so ciety had always been one dedicated  to  human rights <even if it did not always live  up  to that commitment),  the decades be tween the forties and the eighties opened  up new vistas for the concept of rights. If a  necessary condition for the exercise of all  rights is that of life itself <closely followed  by that of minimally decent health), then it  was only a short step to proposing a whole  new range of what came to be called welfare  rights, and to include among them a right to  health care. Moreover, given the scientific  and medical progress,  it seemed perfectly  feasible to propose such a right. In earlier  times, when medicine  lacked any decisive  power  to save  lives, when nature seemed  beyond human control, it would have made  little sense to talk of a right to health care;  similarly, before it was clearly understood  that many environmental  risks are man made,  it would have made equally poor  sense to talk of a right to a healthy environ ment. In sum, not only could health be im proved and risks reduced, but human beings  could now claim a right to those goods. A  24945  technological and a moral revolution were  thus joined.  Unhappily, as we know, the past few years  have seen a sharp change in mood. While  there still remains considerable zeal and jus tification  for  the  improvement of health  and reduction of risk, a number of impor tant realities have emerged to force a much  more complex, and troubled, understanding  of our present situation and our future pos sibilities.  Three  general  factors  have  emerged to change the perspective and to  move  the discussion  to a different plane.  The  first  factor  is economic,  the second  technological, and the third moral.  The  economic  factor  encompasses  a  number of elements. Even prior  to our  present economic troubles there were some  nagging worries about the possible financial  cost that an all-out effort to guarantee a  right to health care might entail. In medi cine, it has been reluctantly recognized that  the  list of human  evils  that might be  brought under medical superintendence is  almost unlimited, ranging from the ills of  the body through the threats to psychologi cal health posed by life in a complex socie ty. The desire for medical benefits seemed  unlimited, not only in terms of dealing with  present, obvious ills, but potentially by ex tending the net of medicine to capture the  full range of social ills, as well. It was not  impossible to imagine spending the entire  gross national product on the improvement  of health and unhappiness.  In the sixties and the early part of the  seventies, that was an underground worry  only, with only a  few stray voices being  raised to wonder where we were heading.  The major political efforts went toward ex tending  the scope of biomedical research  and the delivery of medical care. Even so, as  the seventies moved along, it became pain fully obvious that the national health bill  was increasing at a rapid rate, far outstrip ping that of inflation in general. Moreover,  an insight of horrendous proportions was  becoming  inescapable-that  the  day  of  cheap technological fixes for human illness  was, with  the conquest of  infectious dis eases, over. Instead, it was becoming obvious  that the future promised to deliver rapidly  escalating costs with increasingly marginal  returns from expenditures. The reason for  that is fairly simple. With the conquest of  the great killers of the young and otherwise  able-influenza,  diphtheria,  dysentery,  yellow fever, smallpox, for example-the re maining diseases, primarily affecting the el derly, came to the fore. Cancer, heart dis ease, and stroke-chronic disease in gener al-have proved to be tough foes, and not  one of them is likely to be amenable to inex pensive solutions. One may grant that the  $1.8 billion expended each year on 20,000 di alysis patients extends their lives, and grant  also  that open heart surgery and heart  transplants, vastly improved neonatal inten sive care units, artificial limbs and joints, all  bring notable health benefits. But the bill  for those benefits is beginning to look astro nomical.  I believe that those problems would have  become manifest even if the prosperity of  the fifties and sixties had continued unabat ed. At some point or other, but perhaps  later than has turned out to be the case, it  would have dawned on everyone that the  maximization of health is a highly expen sive goal. That the economic  times have  turned sour, and that those realities have  been forced upon us in a dramatic way, only  underscores what was an implicity inherent  problem in the first place. The problem is  ",1983
1230,692,18,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Speaker, here is a  letter I  received from Mr. Judson F.  Haggerty  of  Indianapolis,  Ind.  It  seems  fortunate  that he and Mark  Twain were able to get together at this  critical time when the administration  seems so prone to compel history to  repeat itself. Our country should go to  war when we have to, not just when  we have a chance to.  HAGGERTY & HAGGERTY,  ATTORNEYS AT LAW,  Indianapolis, Ind., August 1, 1983.  Congressman ANDREW JACOBS, Jr.,  House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR ANDY: I have come up with Reagan's  campaign slogan for '84-""He Kept Us Out  of Peace."" This latest foolishness in Central  America reminds us of Mark Twain's warn ing:  ""The  loud  little handful-as usual-will  shout for the war. The pulpit will-warily  and cautiously-object-at first;  the great,  big, dull bulk of  the nation will  rub  its  sleepy eyes and try to make out why there  should be a war, and will say, earnestly and  indignantly, ""It is unjust and dishonorable,  and there is no necessity for it."" Then the  handful will shout louder. A few fair men  on the other side will argue and  reason  against the war with speech and pen, and at  first will have a hearing and be applauded;  but it will not last long; those others will  out shout them, and presently the anti-war  audiences will thin out and lose popularity.  Before long you will see this curious thing:  the speakers stoned from the platform, and  free speech strangled by hordes of furious  men who in their secret hearts are still at  one with those stoned speakers-as earlier but do not dare to say so. And now the  whole nation-pulpit and all-will take up  the war-cry, and shout itself hoarse, and  mob any honest man who ventures to open  his mouth; and presently such mouths will  cease  to open. Next  the  statesmen will  invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon  the nation that is attacked, and every man  will be glad of those conscience-soothing fal sities, and will diligently study them, and  refuse to examine any refutations of them;  and thus he will by and by convince himself  that the war is just, and will thank God for  the better sleep he enjoys after this process  of grotesque self-deception.""

1231,692,18,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my  colleagues  the  following  article  by  Roger Winter which recently appeared  in  the New York Times  regarding  piracy in the Gulf of Thailand.  Brutal atrocities,  including murder,  rape, kidnaping, and robbery, continue  to be inflicted upon innocent refugees  fleeing from Indochina  in search of  freedom by boat. In the first 3 months  of 1983, 53 percent of the boats arriv ing in Thailand were attacked-on an  average of 2112 times each.  Some progress has been achieved in  curbing these criminal attacks, but the  level of brutality remains intolerable. I  agree with Mr. Winter's conclusion  that ""the world community can do  much better."" I commend Mr. Winter  and the United States Committee for  Refugees, which he directs,  for  the  leadership and humanitarian concern  which led them to recently send a del egation  to Southeast Asia  to study  what could be done to protect these in nocent refugees.  BOAT REFUGEES' HORRORS  <By Roger P. Winter>  WASHINGTON.-The  flow  of Vietnamese  boat refugees has fallen sharply since 1979,  yet there remains a steady leakage across  the Gulf of Thailand and the South China  Sea of those who have experienced or fear  repression  by  Vietnamese  authorities.  Today's refugees face the same dangers as  their  predecessors;  rough  seas  and  un seaworthy boats; Vietnamese Navy patrols;  and, in some cases, an inhospitable welcome  on the receiving shores. But these dangers  pale next to the horror of pirate attacks.  The pirates are not of the swashbuckling va riety, but rather common thugs and mur derers on the high seas.  More than two-thirds of all Vietnamese  refugee boats that land in Thailand and Ma laysia are attacked by pirates, most more  than once. ""Attack"" in a term that covers a  multitude of atrocities. Theft of whatever  valuables the refugees have brought with  them is universal. Frequently the attackers  also steal the boat's motor or otherwise dis able the craft, causing enormous suffering  and loss of  life. However, violence  is  the  most vicious of all.  On May 6, for example, a boat carrying 31  Vietnamese refugees was attacked twice by  Thai pirates. Twelve of the refugees were  knifed or clubbed to death and thrown over board. Three young women were abducted;  the possibility that they survived is mini mal. Twelve more people drowned when the  refugee boat sank while being towed by the  pirates. Only four men survived. In this inci dent  it  is not known whether  rapes oc curred. The normal pattern, however, is for  young women to be repeatedly raped, some times dozens of times. If abducted, they and  any young children with them are usually  thrown overboard; a few are sold into prosti tution.  ",1983
1232,705,18,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, I am sub mitting for the RECORD today an excel lent article written by Mr. David C.  Russell who is the Acting Director of  the Minerals Management Service of  the Department of Interior.  In this article, Mr. Russell accurate ly portrays the overwhelming need for  an orderly and  systematic develop ment of our vast energy resources on  the Outer Continental Shelf.  While Americans may no longer find  themselves waiting  in gas  lines, our  energy problems are far from being  over and I believe we must move for ward  in  an  environmentally  safe  11-059 ~-23 (Pt. 18)  24971  manner to lease, explore, develop, and  produce these vital OCS resources.  I would  highly  recommend  that  every Member of this legislative body  review  this  insightful article closely  and join with me in opposing any at tempt to restrict or prohibit activity  on the Outer Continental Shelf.  The text of the article follows:  Now, TELL THE TRUTH: WHAT'S ocs MEAN?  <By David Russell)  Most Americans know as much about the  Department of the Interior's offshore oil  and gas leasing program as they know about  Chad. Yet, when it comes  to energy,  the  program is probably America's most impor tant.  Now, tell the truth; did you know that our  Outer Continental Shelf <OCS> may contain  over one-half of this nation's future petrole um production-worth over $2  trillion at  today's prices? Or that the oil could replace  25 years' worth of imports at 1982 rates, and  the offshore natural gas could heat 23 mil lion homes for 50 years?  After the recess, Congress will again be  asked to amend the Interior Department's  appropriations bill  to include  language  to  prohibit leasing off certain coastal areas. If  successful, this action would undermine the  offshore leasing program and balkanize the  U.S.  into separate and competing energy producing and consuming states. This lan guage, already passed by the House, repre sents parochial excisions, a misuse of the  appropriations process, and an attempt to  relitigate arguments rejected by the Courts  June 9 in California vs. Watt. It would allow  regions which can find vocal sponsors  in  Congress  to avoid  their  responsibility  to  make a contribution  to America's energy  needs.  This is a disturbing trend. Obviously, if  every member of Congress from a coastal  district were  to say,  ""Sorry, not off my  beaches,"" that would be the end of offshore  leasing and production. If inland states were  to take the same attitude toward coal, oil  shale, oil and gas, we could write off our na tion's future.  Offshore oil resources provide significant  energy without  the need for government  subsidies. In fact, offshore oil and gas devel opment could generate billions of dollars,  provide jobs and ensure increased supplies  of domestic energy.  Recent lease offerings underscore this po tential: $2.l billion  for drilling  rights  in  Alaska's Diapir Field, in September 1982; a  record $3.4 billion at the May 1983 Central  Gulf of Mexico offering; and $1.4 billion for  Western Gulf of Mexico tracts offered just  a few weeks ago. Since Secretary Watt took  office,  the offshore  leasing program has  generated nearly $8.5 billion  in  lease bo nuses alone. Leases have been issued for a  little over 2,000 tracts covering about 11 mil lion acres.  Recent discoveries indicate that many of  these tracts will be very productive. In fact,  a record bid for a single lease in the Santa  Maria Basin off California was followed less  than 18 months later by the discovery of  what could be a billion-barrel oil field-the  biggest discovery  in North America since  Prudhoe Bay. Discoveries like these make  all the lawsuits, criticisms and delays well  worth the hassle.  Previous administrations pursued policies  which leased only 22 million acres-2.5 per cent of the OCS-in 26 years, compared to  123 million acres leased by Canada. Those  ",1983
1233,718,18,Mr. BAKER., I thank the Chair.  SENATE SCHEDULE  ,1983
1234,718,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, we have  an  extensive  unanimous-consent  agreement for  the further consider ation of  the  Interior appropriations  bill. However, it is still my hope and  my intention, to the extent that the  Senate will permit it, that we finish  this bill today. So Senators should be  on notice of the possibility that we  will be in session a little longer than  ordinary  today.  I hope not, but  in  looking over this agreement, it looks  likely we will be pretty lucky if we  finish all of this by the usual adjourn ment hour of 6  p.m. So Senators  should know that we, if the managers  wish, may stay a little longer in order  to finish the bill.  I  thiiik. we need to do that because  we need to try to reach the revenue sharing authorization bill after this.  We have got other matters, including  the Martin Luther King matter on  Friday of this week. That has already  been announced and it is my intention  to try to stick with that.  So I must reluctantly, but nonethe less accurately,  I am afraid, predict  that we will be in past the hour of 6  p.m. this evening, if necessary, to com plete this measure.  ",1983
1235,718,18,Mr. BYRD., Will the majority leader  yield to me?  ,1983
1236,718,18,Mr. BAKER.," Yes, I yield to the mi nority leader.  ",1983
1237,718,18,Mr. BYRD.," On the matter respect ing  legislation  concerning Martin  Luther King's birthday, I have a Sena tor who is a Presidential candidate",1983
1238,718,18,Mr. BAKER., The Senator has many  Senators who are Presidential candi dates.  ,1983
1239,718,18,Mr. BYRD.," I accept that correction.  I have a Senator who is a Presiden tial candidate who has asked that the  vote on the Martin Luther King reso lution-and he supports it-occur not  next week and not this week, unless it  is  today, but rather the week after  next.  Would the majority leader be ame nable to our seeking out in both of our  Cloak Rooms  the  sentiments as  to  whether or not we could  reach an  agreement that a vote on final passage  will  occur  one  day,  Tuesday  or  Wednesday whatever it is,  the week  after next at a certain hour?  ",1983
1240,718,18,Mr. BAKER.," I have no objection to  that, Mr. President. I must say, howev er, that I guess today is the fourth or  fifth  time I have announced to the  Senate that it would be this week. I do  not want to be in the position of any  Member, or indeed any of those many  people outside the Senate who are vi tally interested in this matter, think ing that I am  in any way receding  from my commitments to try to get  this matter up and get it up promptly.  But  the answer  to  the Senator's  question is if there is a general consen sus of views that another time would  be more convenient and if those who  are interested in this matter who are  not Members of the Senate concur in  that, I would feel then released from  the voluntary commitment I made to  take this matter up shortly after we  returned  from  the August  recess,  which is the reason I am trying to get  it up this week.  So I will be glad to talk to the minor ity leader further about this, and if we  can satisfy  those conditions, we will  try to find a time that is more conven ient.  But I made the commitment before  we left for the August recess that it  would come up shortly after we  re turned. This is the second week after  the August recess and I feel my time  under that statement is running out.  So unless  I can be relieved of that  commitment  I  voluntarily  took,  I  would be loath to postpone it. But if I  can, and if there is a clear showing  that that is agreeable to the parties in volved, I will be glad to consider it.  ",1983
1241,718,18,Mr. BYRD.,"  I  thank  the majority  leader. I respect his position that he  has to keep a commitment. The only  thing that I am proposing here is that  we check with  the parties on both  sides, and those outside the Senate, if  the majority leader feels a need to do  that, as to whether or not we could  agree that there will be a final vote-I  think that is  the  important thing there will be a final vote on a given  day of the week after next or on to morrow. I  think earlier I said today,  but tomorrow.  Certainly, this is no feeling of mine.  We can have the vote today or tomor row, as far as the majority leader and  I are personally concerned. But if we  could just explore that; we may end up  at the dead end.  ",1983
1242,718,18,Mr. BAKER.," Maybe, but I will be  glad to explore it.  ",1983
1243,718,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that I may yield  my time to the majority leader, with  the understanding  that  if I have a  statement later today it appear in the  RECORD immediately following the ma jority leader's remarks.  ",1983
1244,718,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1983
1245,718,18,Mr. BAKER., I yield now to the dis tinguished Senator from Maine.  ,1983

1247,718,18,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, because  of my personal interest in U.S. policy  toward Central America, I  joined re cently with my Senate Armed Services  Committee colleague, Senator GARY  HART in urging the committee's chair man, Senator JOHN TowER to devote  greater oversight  to  this  important  question.  As a member of the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence, I have had  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.  ",1983
1248,731,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Three  minutes remain to the Senator from  Montana.  ,1983
1249,731,18,Mr. MELCHER.," Madam President, I  reserve the remainder of my time.  I ask my colleague from New Mexico  if it is his understanding that some of  our colleagues are expecting this vote  to occur at 2:30.  Mr. DOMENIC!. I do not think so.  The Senator may know of some. Basi cally, when we  started,  I  suggested  that I was not going to use all of my  time and,  therefore, we might vote  earlier than 1 % hours after we started.  I still feel they are aware of that. We  could ask the leadership representa tion about it. I think the answer is we  are ready to vote any time the Senator  is ready. I am ready to yield back but I  will not yield back until we get an  answer.  Madam President, I suggest the ab sence of a quorum.  ",1983
1250,731,18,Mr. MELCHER.," Since I have only 3  minutes, may I ask my colleague that  this quorum call be charged against  his time?  Mr. DOMENIC!. Yes.  ",1983
1251,731,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the  roll.  ,1983
1252,731,18,Mr. EXON.," Madam President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1983
1253,731,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection,  it is so ordered. Who  yields time?  Mr. DOMENIC!. I yield time to the  distinguished Senator.  I  understand  he has a question.  ",1983
1254,731,18,Mr. EXON.," I would like to pose a  question and possibly get an answer  from both of the sponsoring Senators  from New Mexico  on  the matter  before us.  Let me see if I understand the issue.  We are authorizing the expenditure of  $450,000 basically for attorney fees, as  I understand it. Is that correct?  Mr. DOMENIC!. I believe it is attor ney fees and/or expert fees.  ",1983
1255,731,18,Mr. EXON.," As I understand it, this  is a dispute between certain American  Indians and  their water  rights and  claims and they are being represented,  the Indian interests are being repre sented, at Government expense at this  time. Is that correct?  the State of New Mexico. That has  been  the position consistently since  this  case was  17  years  ago.  During the time I was attorney gener al, that was certainly the position that  we took and it was well known to all  parties in the litigation that the State  could not  effectively  represent  the  non-Indians in the litigation.  The final point. which is the basic  point  that  I  think  is  the moving  reason for this amendment. and that  is simply that we do have a responsi bility.  I  believe.  in  this country  to  insure some  type of fatmess  in our  dealings with any group of people. We  have a situation here where a  large  group of individual private landowners  are not plaintiffs in this litigation. I  think there has been some confusion  about that. These are not people who  have brought  this suit to challenge  the rights of Indians or the rights of  anyone else. These are people who  have been sued. who are defendants in  the litigation and who are defendants  through no cause of their own.  They are  trying to see  to  it that  their position is adequately put forth  in the court. I think that is essential if  the decision of the court is to be given  respect by all persons involved in the  case.  I feel it is essential if we are going to  have fatmess in this case and maintain  the appearance, which I believe needs  to be a reality in this country, that the  Government deals fairly with people  from whatever group.  So I support the amendment. I again  commend  the  senior Senator  from  New Mexico for offering this amend ment, and I welcome the chance to co sponsor it.  HAWKINS  assumed  <Mrs.  the  chair.)  ",1983
1256,731,18,Mr. MELCHER.," Madam President, I  think there are one or two gaps in the  presentation that has been made so  far and I will try to fill those in. I ap preciate the comments of my two col leagues from New Mexico. As I have  stated before, I understand their con cern and I applaud their concern. But  I hasten to advise my two friends from  New Mexico, as well as the rest of the  Senate,  that this amendment would  indeed establish a precedent. a prece dent that infringes upon the fiduciary  obligation of the United States.  One of the gaps that has not been  filled in yet is why this case has taken  so long. I might point out one of the  reasons why it took so long was be cause a  lower court said, when  the  tribes  sought  to  have  independent  counsel other than the Justice Depart ment. the court ruled that that was  impossible; that they were represented  by the Justice Department and, there fore,  the tribes could not hire their  own counsel.  The laWYers for the tribes presented  themselves and they said, ""Well, after  all, there is a conflict of interest in",1983
1257,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, will the  Senator yield?  Mr. McCLURE. I yield.  ",1983
1258,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I want to  join the distinguished manager of the  bill, Mr. McCLURE, in commending Mr.  JOHNSTON, who is the acting ranking  member, and in doing so, I also want  to personally commend Mr. McCLURE,  the chairman, on the dedication and  skill and the fine workmanship they  have demonstrated here in connection  with this bill. They have worked hard.  They  have  considered  the  amend ments that were called up. They have  done so, I  think, in a way that has  made the Senate proud.  Mr. JOHNSTON is off the floor at this  moment, but  I  certainly share  the  manager's comments concerning Mr.  JOHNSTON, and I want to add my own.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator from West Virginia  for those comments.  I want to add what is known to all  Members of the Senate, and that is  that the Senator from West Virginia,  as the former chairman of this sub committee, set a very high standard  for us to emulate. So we have been  challenged. I appreciate his remarks.  ",1983
1259,744,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, I would  be derelict if I did not extend my con gratulations  to  the  distinguished  chairman of the subcommittee and the  distinguished  designated  minority  manager, Mr. JOHNSTON, and  to  the  Senators who participated in this bill,  yet another of the regular appropriations bills.    We spent a  little over 18 hours in  consideration of  this measure,  and  there were a number of amendments  agreed to, a number rejected. It was a  difficult bill to deal with, and it tradi tionally is.  I  especially  congratulate  Mr.  McCLURE for his effective handling of  this measure.  ",1983
1260,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, will the  majority leader yield to me?  ",1983

1262,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, in my ex perience around here,  I have noted  from time to time that there are a lot  of unfounded rumors circulated, and  one rumor that has been circulated  today is to the effect that the Demo crats are dragging their feet on the  Martin Luther King, Jr., bill.  Now I  think that rumor may have  been stimulated by a question which I  proposed to the distinguished majority  leader earlier  today or a  statement  that I made; namely, that we on our  side would like to vote on the Martin  Luther King measure either tomorrow  or the week after next and that possi bly we could work out an agreement  which would set a date certain so that  all Senators would be on notice. That  date could be on any day of the week  after next and at any particular time.  The reason I made  the request  is  that one of the Presidential candidates  on my side of the aisle-and it was not  I-could not be here Friday this week,  could not be here next week, and he  was hopeful  that he could be here  when the matter was voted on. So he  was suggesting that it be tomorrow or  the week after next.  So I want to make the record clear  that the Democrats are not attempt ing to drag their feet on this matter.  We are ready to vote on tomorrow. As  I have privately discussed with the dis tinguished majority leader, I think we  are in a position to off er an agreement  which would  allow  for 2 hours of  debate on tomorrow and 1 hour on an  amendment by Mr. RANDOLPH  to be  equally divided, and that the agree ment be in the usual form.  <Mr. JEPSEN assumed the chair.)  ",1983
1263,744,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr.  President,  this  morning when the Senate opened-I  guess it was this morning, it seems like  a long time ago-but this morning, the  minority leader and I had a little collo quy about one of the Democratic Pres idential candidates in the Senate-and  I guess, with a lack of a seriousness, I  said  that  there are  several on  the  Democratic side, and  it would be a  little difficult  to  figure out which  one-but that one of those Members  would be absent on Friday, when I had  announced that it was my intention to  try  to get  the Martin Luther King  vote.  I  also  explained  to  the minority  leader, in our colloquy this morning  during leader time, that I, long ago,  before the August recess, said that I  was going to try to take up that meas ure shortly after we returned from the  August recess. And I am committed to  that-indeed, I took the matter direct ly to the calendar in order to expedite  that-and I want to perform on that  commitment.  I have announced now for some sev eral days we were going to do it on  Friday and I expect that some of my  Members on this side of the aisle have  made their plans on that basis.  But, Mr. President, if the minority  leaders wants to off er a  time agree ment and if he wants to do the meas ure on tomorrow, if he will give me a  little time and I can run that through  our traps and see, I will be glad to see  if we can do it. But if we cannot do it,  I must tell the minority leader in all  candor that it is my intention to try to  reach that bill on Friday of this week.  I do not feel that I can postpone it for  a week and a half.  ",1983
1264,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," I certainly recognize the  circumstances that would conspire to  put the majority leader in the position  that he is and I respect his position  and certainly would not expect him to  break any commitment and would re spect him for keeping it. But if he is  ready on tomorrow, we are ready on  this side. I might have to add to the  request that there be 1 hour on an  amendment which might or might not  be offered by ",1983
1265,744,18,Mr. NUNN.,  ,1983
1266,744,18,Mr. BAKER.," Very well, I will run  that through our system and we will  see.  Just to repeat it for the sake of clar ity, I do feel a strong commitment to  take the matter up this week. If we  can do it tomorrow on a  time agree ment, that is fine with me. I will check  our side to see if that works out. But if  we cannot get that agreement, regard less of which side the objection might  come from, I am committed to try to  take up the measure on Friday.  ",1983
1267,744,18,Mr. BYRD.," While  the majority  leader has the floor and is answering  questions, would  he  also  indicate  whether or not there is going to be  any more rollcall votes today?  ",1983
1268,744,18,Mr. BAKER.," Yes. I  thank the mi nority leader for asking.  It is 5 o'clock plus 4 minutes. I am  told we can get to the revenue sharing  reauthorization bill. That will not take  more than an hour or so. I think we  ought to do that. So I think we ought  to go ahead with it and I would expect  rollcall votes.  Mr. President, while we are trying to  run our clearances on a  time agree ment on  the Martin Luther King  matter,  I wonder  if  the minority  leader is  in a position to approve a  unanimous-consent  request  that we  now go to the revenue sharing reau thorization.

It  is not that GRS is an evil or bad pro gram. This is not a means-tested pro gram, frankly. There are many pro grams that do affect the needy. It is  my view that we ought to be concen trating our resources, if we are going  to be adding any money to bills,  to  programs that help the truly needy.  We all have mayors, we all have  township people who would  like  a  little more money. It comes out rough ly,  in this case, to a  little less than  $5,800 per municipality.  I hope that we reject this amend ment, not because it is not wellmean ing, but because, we must reduce the  deficit rather than add to it.  Second, I hate to think that just be cause there is some room under the  budget resolution, we are going to take  that as a license simply to spend more  than money. I said a moment ago and  I meant it: I hope the budget resolu tion and the numbers it contains will  be seen as limits as far as spending is  concerned; they should not be targets  for us to try to reach or exceed.

1289,757,18,Mr. LONG.," Mr. President, the reve nue sharing extension bill reported by  the Committee on Finance includes an  amendment to change the way those  funds are distributed among local gov ernments. This formula change is un necessary, undesirable, and unwanted  by  those affected.  I am offering an  amendment  to delete  that  formula  change.  Even though the Finance Commit tee did not approve an  increase  in  funding for this program, it included  in the bill a formula change which will  apply to any additional funds which  might be added later in the consider ation of this bill or in some future  year. The  impact  of  this  formula  change is very substantial. It means  that most cities and towns and coun ties in this country will get less than  their full share of whatever increase  may take place.  At the time the Finance Committee  acted on this bill, detailed information  about  its  impact was not available.  Since then, the Treasury Department  has provided statistics showing what  the result would be under different  possible funding increases.  One set of statistics assumes  that  Congress will provide a $450 million  increase in the program. This is what  the House bill provides and what is as sumed in the budget resolution. With  a $450 million increase, well over two thirds of all  local governments are  losers under the Finance Committee  formula. That is  to say,  they get a  smaller share of the $450 million than  they would without  that change  in  formula. The amount each govern ment loses under the Finance Commit tee formula varies from place to place.  But in many instances the loss is sub stantial. For 43 percent of all jurisdic tions,  the loss  is  total. They get no  share whatever out of a $450 million  increase.  ,  ",1983
1290,770,18,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to support  prompt, favorable consideration of leg islation to reauthorize the general rev enue-sharing program. Revenue shar ing is an outstanding example of the  Federal Government's ability to assist  local governments to meet their fiscal  needs.  The unique feature of this program,  as we  in Congress know,  is  that it  allows Federal dollars to flow to local  governments to address their specific  needs. This is an efficient utilization  of Federal funds, because, in contrast  to categorical grant programs, under  the revenue-sharing program, local of ficials have the freedom to apportion  funds to the problems they deem most  pressing.  General revenue sharing was created  by the State and Local Fiscal Assist ance Act of 1972 <Public Law 92-512)  and was subsequently extended for 4  years in 1976 by the State and local  fiscal assistance amendments (Public  Law 94-488). Once again in 1980, with  the enactment of the State and Local  Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments of  1980 (Public Law 96-604), the general  revenue-sharing  program was  reau thorized for 3 more years. However,  authorization  of  this  program will  expire on September 30, 1983, unless it  is reauthorized. I believe the general  revenue-sharing program has been a  tremendously important program pro viding State and  local governments  with valuable general purpose  fiscal  assistance. In fact, passage of revenue  sharing marked a fundamental change  in intergovernmental relations.  Continuation of the general revenue sharing program is extremely impor tant both in terms of fiscal impact and  budgetary planning stability to State  and local governments. According to a  National League of Cities survey, over  40 percent of all small cities now re ceive no other Federal aid, and 80 per cent of cities surveyed said they would  be forced to cut services next year if  the program were reduced or eliminat ed.  In addition, 50 percent of such  small cities said they felt they would  be  forced  to  raise  taxes  if  revenue  sharing is not continued.  The success of the revenue-sharing  program in the State of Arkansas is  widely acclaimed. The total amount of  general  revenue-sharing  program  funds received by all municipalities in  the State of Arkansas was $43,441,575  in fiscal year 1982, and will be approxi mately $46,413,653 in fiscal year 1983,  if the program is reauthorized.  Mr. President, I have been a consist ent supporter of the revenue-sharing  program and I strongly support con tinuation of the program.  It is important, Mr. President, that  the Senate act expeditiously  in this  matter. Local officials are  trying  to  plan their budgets for fiscal year 1984  and beyond. We,  in Congress,  can  make  their  jobs more  rational  by  quickly approving a bill, so that they  will know what kind of Federal assist ance their jurisdiction can expect.  This program deserves strong con gressional support, both for now and  in the future. The funds provided to  local governments through the reve nue-sharing program are used for a va riety of important projects, from the  creation of jobs to the rebuilding of  local infrastructures. Mr. President, I  am told by local officials that this is  the one program that affords  them  the flexibility to actually target Feder al funds to specific local needs. Such a  program,  in  light of  the  financial  strains of local governments, is sorely  needed.  ",1983
1291,770,18,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong support of rapid action on the  renewal of the general revenue-shar ing  program  at  adequate  funding  levels. During the August recess, I had  the opportunity to meet with numer ous local officials in Tennessee. From  Mountain City to Memphis, they all  voiced  their strong support for con tinuation of this important program of  aid to local governments.  There is just no question that this  program is viewed positively, both by  our Nation's local officials and from  the Washington perspective. Officials  of local communities like the program  because  they can decide where and  how the money is to be spent. We here  in Washington are impressed with this  program, too, because it is so efficient.  Less than 1 percent of revenue-sharing  funds go for overhead and administra tive costs. That means that the great est possible proportion of the money is  targeted by local government officials  toward areas of greatest need.  Since  the general  revenue sharing  program began in 1972, Tennessee has  received more than $1 billion from the  program. Local officials  in my State  have used these funds wisely to pro vide a wide variety of essential services  including police and fire protection,  highway maintenance, and education.  A  sampling of projects  funded  in  middle Tennessee,  for  example,  in cludes: the purchase of an ambulance,  the placement of street and  traffic  lights, improvements to police and fire  facilities, and expenditures for librar ies.  Many of  these  local governments  would be forced to either raise taxes  or cut services  if revenue sharing is  not made available.  One Tennessee government, for ex ample, the city of Chattanooga, allots  $2.6 million of their annual $3.8 mil lion annual revenue sharing funding  for use in the operating budget. The  rest goes  to vital capital projects. If  revenue-sharing funds were not avail able  to Chattanooga,  then  it would  take a 32-cent increase in the property  tax to replace it. Or services to Chat tanoogans would have to be cut in pro portion to the funding reduction.  The  town of Murfreesboro, Tenn.,  would face a 45-cent increase in prop erty taxes without revenue sharing.  Shelbyville, Tenn., would have  to  raise the property tax rate 50  to 60  cents if revenue sharing is not made  available.  Revenue sharing is especially impor tant to these-and other-local com munities in my State because of the  tax base which is limited by the per manent restraints of the State consti tution. The same situation exists  in  many other States. We have a respon sibility to all of the 39,000 local gov ernments across this country to con tinue to fund revenue sharing to help  them provide public services  to our  mutual constituents.  We must act quickly on the renewal  of  this vital program. Already,  the  delay  in  reauthorization has caused  undue complications  in the prepara tion of municipal and county budgets.  Most of these budgets had to be com plete by July 1. Revenue-sharing allo cations could not be assumed for this  deadline because Congress has not yet  acted to renew the program.  I  support  Senator  MOYNIHAN's  amendment to increase revenue-shar ing funding by $450 million annually.  Adjusting the program upward makes  partial amends for the erosion of the  program by the effects of inflation.  However,  I do not favor modifica tions in the revenue-sharing formula  that would be  triggered by any  in creases in funding under the current  provisions of S. 1426. These formula  changes would mean that only about  half of the local governments now re ceiving revenue sharing would be eligi ble  to share in the $450 million  in crease.  That hardly seems fair. All local gov ernments are now experiencing finan cial stress due to inflation and the re cession. That  is why I also support  Senator LONG'S amendment to delete  these formal modifications.  With  these changes  in S. 1426,  I  wholeheartedly support this renewal. I  encourage rapid action on this legisla tion.  ",1983

1293,783,18,Mr.  BENTSEN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing legislation pro viding for the payment of benefits to  survivors of  retired missing Federal  employees or Members of Congress.  Under current law, the Office of Per sonnel Management does not have the  authority to pay a missing retiree's an nuity to the surviving spouse. Further,  the OPM cannot begin payment of  survivor benefits in a case where a re tiree is presumed missing but not offi cially declared dead. My bill is intend ed to rectify this situation.  This discrepancy  in  the  law was  brought to my attention by one of my  constituents, the wife of the Federal  retiree missing since October 1980. My  constituent's husband, along with a  U.S. Army officer, vanished on a flight  from Spain to Germany. Upon learn ing of the retiree's disappearance, the  OPM suspended his monthly annuity  check. However, in the absence of any  official determination of death,  the  OPM did not commence payment of  survivor benefits  to his widow.  In  short, he was dead enough for  the  OPM to terminate his pension, but not  dead enough to allow payment of sur vivor benefits to my constituent.  Because  a  civil  service  annuity  earned by an individual is for his own  use and  is not considered  to be a  family benefit, it cannot be claimed by  living  dependents.  In  addition,  the  OPM cannot make a determination of  death, and requires a death certificate  in order to commence payment of sur vivor benefits. In this particular case,  the required certificate of death was  to be provided by the Spanish Govern ment, which concluded that there was  insufficient  evidence  to  presume  death.  By contrast, existing law permits a  Government agency to make an offi cial finding of death in the case of a  missing Federal civilian employee or  active duty member of a uniformed  service. The Army officer accompany ing my constituent's husband was offi cially determined dead by the Depart ment of the Army based upon the cir cumstances surrounding the officer's  disappearance. Although  these  facts  were identical to those of the missing  Federal retiree,  the information was  insufficient for the OPM.  Upon learning of the incident, I re quested the Government Accounting  Office to investigate this discrepancy  which allowed the Department of the  Army  greater  discretion  than  the  OPM. The GAO determined that cur rently there is neither statutory nor  regulatory  authority  for  a Govern ment agency to make an official find ing of death in the case of missing  Federal  retirees. The GAO  recom mended  that statutory authority be  given to the OPM to declare the miss ing person dead and extend protection  to the annuitant's dependents.  The OPM concurred with the GAO  that statutory authority is needed to  resolve this problem and to give the  OPM the necessary mandate. There fore,  I  am  introducing  legislation  which would allow a survivor benefit  to be paid to any individual who would  otherwise be entitled to an annuity in  the event of the death of a retired em ployee. If a missing retiree does not re appear and claim his benefits within 6  months of the date the Office deter mined him to be missing, the OPM is  authorized to commence payment of  survivor benefits.  We need a consistent Government  policy to protect the rights of depend ents of our civil service retirees. For 3  years, my constituent has been unable  to  receive  the  survivor benefits  to  which she is entitled. I hope that the  appropriate committees will act swift ly to rectify this situation.

1309,809,18,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, the House  appears ready to give its approval for  American troops to remain in Lebanon  for an additional 18 months, and I be lieve that is a mistake.  I have always believed that in the  context of an overall settlement in the  Middle East, we would have to be pre pared to send American troops as part  of an international peacekeeping force  if we were requested to do so by all  parties to the settlement. But it seems  to me that in this situation it is simply  wrong  to provide authority  for our  troops to remain there for 18 months.  I  think 18 months  is  too  long. We  should not be in a position where we  appear to be fighting on one side of an  age-old conflict.  Mr. Speaker, I would support, for in stance, giving  the administration 60  days to report under the War Powers  Act, but after that I believe that the  war powers clock ought to tick and the  Congress ought to make a judgment at  that time about what further steps are  necessary.

Since the administration took office,  about 1 million students have been cut  off  from Federal student aid. That  number would be even higher had we  not restored many of the deep cuts  proposed by the administration.  For the coming fiscal year, the Ap propriations Committee has developed  a good bill with a responsible student  aid package. Pell grants and student  loans are kept intact. Work study is in creased from the current year, and the  other  campus-based  programs  are  saved from the administration's plan  to terminate them.  This bill will be good for students  and families in Connecticut, certainly  better than the program we received  in February. I urge my colleagues to  support this vital appropriations bill.

1313,822,18,Mr. HAWKINS., I yield to the gen tleman from Kentucky.  ,1983
1314,822,18,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the substitute.  The gentleman  from  Illinois <Mr.  DURBIN) has good  intentions. But if  his amendment  is  adopted, we will  throw a monkey wrench into the oper ation of this program.  The purpose of this bill  is  to put  people to work, unemployed people to  work  immediately.  Instead of doing  that,  this  amendment would  ham string, delay, and disrupt the entire  program throughout the country.  I am sure the gentleman from Illi nois does not want that to happen.  I would suggest to all Members that  we  have  had much  experience  in  recent years with enacting  require ments that proved not to be practical,  although they were based on good in tentions. We should support the sub stitute amendment offered by the gen tleman  from California <Mr. HAW KINS).  ",1983
1315,822,18,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the substitute.  With all due respect to the gentle man from California, and I know he  has spent a  substantial amount of  time  in working on  this  legislation,  and, as I said at the outset, I support  the legislation, I will be voting for it  and  I hope  that what  I  am about  today is viewed as constructive, but I  must rise in opposition to the substi tute amendment for the following rea sons:  In the first  instance, here we are  talking about paying administrators  comparable  salaries  for what  they  presently do if they are administrators  under this act, and yet what we are  creating under this act is a new ap proach, a new program.  So, trying to define what a compara ble function and comparable salary is,  I think is going to be somewhat diffi cult because we are dealing with a  unique creation here in the legislation.  Second, I find some difficulty with  the words ""comparable functions."" In  all due respect, I have to say that with  the words  ""comparable  functions,""  ""comparable  levels of pay,"" we  are  completely surrendering to the State,  local, municipal, and county govern ments the authority to set whatever  pay they want to set for administra tors.  That, in my mind, goes far beyond,  of course,  the intent of my original  amendment and in fact it violates the  very reason it was offered.  When we leave it up to the locals, I  think we look beyond one very impor tant fact. For the men and women  presently unemployed we are going to  bring under this program and ask to  participate, we are going  to provide  them only $230 a week  in most  in stances.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House,  that amount of money  is not some  princely sum that a person would want  to find as a full-time salary and look  forward to retirement. It is an emer gency  measure. We  are  bringing  people in to give them something to do  worthwhile in the community and pay  them a decent wage, not a generous  wage, but a decent wage.  We are asking sacrifice from the par ticipants, yet I cannot understand the  reluctance today from those who are  sponsoring and pushing forward this  legislation to ask this same degree of  sacrifice from administrators.  D 1200  Twenty-nine  thousand dollars does  not, to me, appear to be the kind of  sum that we have to apologize for. In  fact,  I  think it is a  fair amount of  money to pay to a person who is super vising employees who make $11,000.  With  this amendment, we  remove  the cap entirely. If the local unit of  government should certify that they  pay their administrators in like func tions $60,000 per year,  that is what  they will be paid,  I  guess, because  under the substitute amendment, that  authority is given to them.  I do not understand the reluctance  to ask for sacrifice when it comes to  administrative salaries when we have  so many administrative people, white collar workers, who are out of work  today.  Let me clarify one final point which  has been brought out several  times:  What I am about with my original  amendment would not reduce anyone's  existing  salary.  If an employee  for  Government has a  job today and is  paid an amount of money to work that  job and is asked by his administrator  to keep an eye on this program, there  is nothing, absolutely nothing,  that  would reduce their salary until such  time as that administrator seeks Fed eral funds for reimbursement.  If the person, the administrator with  the present job, the deputy mayor or  whatever, takes on that responsibility  and is not paid with Federal funds,  that person can be paid whatever the  unit  of  local  government,  city,  or  whatever, cares to.  ",1983
1316,822,18,Mr. PERKINS.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1317,822,18,Mr. DURBIN., I would be happy to  yield to the chairman.  ,1983
1318,822,18,Mr. PERKINS.," I would state to the  gentleman from Illinois that his argu ment at first flush sounds reasonable.  What the gentleman  is overlooking,  from the viewpoint of the operation of  the program,  is  that when you put  new people in charge of a program,  you are going to delay and disrupt the  program. You are not going to accom plish the purpose you are seeking to  accomplish.  That is what is wrong with the gen tleman's amendment.  We want to get people to work im mediately, not delay getting it started  and disrupt the whole program. Local  governments  have  organizations  in  place which are capable of putting  people to work quickly in accordance  with the law. If you disrupt their ad ministrative systems, they may not get  settled for 6 months. You would be  doing great harm to the program.  That is the reason I think we ought  to  support  the substitute and vote  down  the gentleman's <Mr. DURBIN)  amendment.  ",1983
1319,822,18,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Chairman, I ap preciate  the  gentleman's comment,  but I do not happen to believe that if  we turn to a city or a school district  and tell them that they are going to  have 50 or 100 employees to do impor tant functions, that they will sit back  for 6 months and wait until they can  recruit  supervisors.  I  am  certain  mayors and superintendents of school  districts will find within their existing  operation  the wherewithal  to share  the benefits we are sending back to  the local level.  ",1983

1321,835,18,Mr. GEKAS.," I am willing to take the  blame if any there be for not attach ing this type of amendment to others  in the past. But that is no reason not  to start somewhere. It did not occur to  me that this kind of an amendment  could be salutary and helpful to the  process until very recently and this is  the bill on which  coincidentally  it  came.  believe very wholeheartedly  that we ought to start now.

1322,835,18,Mr. DELLUMS.," Thank you.  I am simply saying to my colleague  the problem is simply this. It is a ques tion of timing. If we really believed in  this, we have been debating the mili tary budget and other more controver sial matters  for  the  last  several  months and suddenly the amendment  occurs on a very fragile piece of legis lation known as an employment bill.  And you know we are going to have  trouble trying to pass this legislation.  The  Jeffords  amendment  already  passed which puts this bill  in some  jeopardy. And I  think that that por tends a very difficult vote on final pas sage with respect to this legislation.  And that is the problem that I see.  If this gentleman could guarantee  that we take $3.5 billion out of the B-1  bomber program, then maybe the gen tleman's  amendment  would  make  some sense. But if you cannot guaran tee that at this moment, where are we  going to get the finances, all we end  up doing is wrecking a piece of legisla tion designed  to address the human  misery. That is what I am opposed to;  not  the  reason of  the gentleman's  amendment but the timing of the gen tleman's amendment and whether or  not we ought to have begun this at the  early part of the year so this gentle man would not feel such great suspi cion as to why this particular bill is  the one that we start down this road  on.  gentleman  0 1430  ",1983
1323,835,18,Mr. GRAY., Will  the  yield?  ,1983
1324,835,18,Mr. DELLUMS., I yield to my col league from Pennsylvania.  ,1983
1325,835,18,Mr. GRAY.," I want to thank the gen tleman  from California  for his elo quent  arguments,  particularly with  regard to my colleague from Pennsyl vania's  amendment, whom  I  have  great respect for as a member of our  delegation. But also to just make sev eral points.  First, we  have  gone  through  a  budget process  in  this House. We  fought the issue of the budget and the  Federal priorities;  and many of us  raised the question during that budget  process. But where was the alternative  budget of many of our colleagues who  now are so concerned about deficits,  who are now so concerned about this  one program?  There was no alternative budget to  demonstrate  all  of  those  priorities  that we have heard for the last 2 days  on this floor.  We also asked where is the budget  that  the President  of  the United  States talked about in February, and  not one Member of this House, includ ing the President's own party, would  bring that budget to the floor as a  statement of those priorities.  Now,  suddenly,  as we  talk about  trying to lower the unemployment for  those who are long-term unemployed,  we are into a debate on the budget  process, when those who had an op portunity to participate in a budget  debate refused to do it, did not offer  an alternative, did not even off er the  alternative of their President.  Second, I would point out to those  who argue that this raises the deficit,  that I do not know what the Secretary  of the Treasury would say since all of  us know right now in the administra tion there is a  lot of confusion. We  have the Secretary of the Treasury  saying deficits do not matter, whereas  before the Budget Committee for the  last 2 years he said deficits do matter.  Now suddenly when this administra tion has a deficit, suddenly  in 1983  when We are staring at a $200 billion plus deficit, the same Secretary of the  Treasury who sat before the Budget  Committee in 1981 and 1982 and said  deficits do not matter, now says they  do.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from California <Mr. DEL LUMS) has again expired.  <On  request of Mr. GRAY  and by  unanimous consent Mr. DELLUMS was  allowed  to proceed  for 2 additional  minutes.>  ",1983
1326,835,18,Mr. DELLUMS., I yield to the gentle man for Pennsylvaina.  ,1983
1327,835,18,Mr. GRAY.," The Chairman of the  Economic Advisers of the President,  the same administration, says deficits  do matter.  So I am wondering that even if the  gentleman's amendment was passed,  and I agree with my colleague from  California  this  is  an  inappropriate  time to do it. But even if it was passed,  I am wondering what the administra tion and the Secretary of the Treasury  would say about it.  The other thing I would point out is  the fundamental question of what are  we doing to the deficit. I say, and I  think many of us say in this House  that it is better to have people on the  payroll  doing  constructive  public  works in our communities rather than  on the Federal rolls, on welfare, on  food stamps, and unemployment com pensation.  The Congressional Budget Office es timates that if this bill is passed we  reduce by $400 million the outlays of  taxpayers' money for food stamps. We  reduce by nearly $900 million the tax payers' money for welfare. And it is es timated that when you take the net  cost it will not be $3.5 billion but by  putting people to work in public works  jobs to rebuild our communities in real  jobs that we are going to save $1.8 bil lion in taxpayers' money for subsidies  for the very same programs that many  of my  colleagues who  are  arguing  against this bill always vote against  and want to reduce.  So, therefore, the real issue before  this body  is a very simple one, and  that is do you want to wait 3 years,  that is the best estimate of the admin istration, 1986, before we get down to  unemployment of 7 .2 percent. Do you  want to wait 3 years and say to those  who are  long-term employed:  ""Just  wait, the economy is recovering. Our  best estimate from the administration  is that it is going to take 3 years. Cer tainly you can wait 3 years and have  the deferral of your hopes, the def er ral of your dreams.""  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from California <Mr. DEL LUMS) has again expired.  <On  request of Mr. GRAY  and by  unanimous consent Mr. DELLUMS was  allowed  to proceed  for 1 additional  minute.)  ",1983
1328,835,18,Mr. DELLUMS., I yield to my col league.  ,1983
1329,835,18,Mr. GRAY.," The very same people  who say this is not an adequate way to  treat the problem are the same people  who say let us cut food stamps, let us  cut welfare.  You cannot have it both ways. If you  want to reduce welfare, if you want to  reduce unemployment compensation,  if you want  to reduce food stamps,  then put people to work.  If you do not want to reduce spend ing on food stamps and welfare, if you  want  to  keep  unemployment high,  then vote against this bill and go back  and tell Americans to wait 3 years for  an  economic  recovery  that many  economists, including Presidential ad visers, are not sure is going to take  place.  Then, at  the same  time you  tell  them you voted against those support  systems from the Federal Government  to provide any help  for  the unem ployed.  I say that is wrong.  I said we had a debate on this in the  budget process and many of those who  are now standing here for the last 2  days arguing against this bill by saying  that  it  increases  the deficit, where  were your voices when you could have  proposed an alternative?  We passed  a  budget  and  passed with bipartisan support.  it was  ",1983
1330,848,18,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Chairman, due  to the fact that during  the general  debate on the bill this amendment was  thoroughly explained, I will not take  the full 5 minutes on the amendment  since I do not believe that it is contro versial and fully understood by both  the majority and minority members of  the committee.  The amendment basically does not  impact  on  the  cities,  counties,  et  cetera, above 50,000, but only impacts  on the balance of State funds that go  to the State, and under the amend ment will still go to the State, but it  makes a determination as to allocation  of the funds, rather than going to the  State and letting the State disperse  them as it sees fit.  It provides that the funds should be  distributed in the formula used in the  bill for the eligible entities, the larger  cities. In other words, it would mean  that the funds going to the State will  actually go to the higher unemployed  rural counties, rather than be distrib uted willy-nilly by the Governor of the  State.  And I believe that it means that the  funds that are going to the balance of  the State for the rural counties will go  to those rural counties who pave high  unemployment  just as  if  the other  funds would go to the major cities and  metropolitan areas with high unem ployment.

But it is also imperative that all un employed  people,  rural  and urban,  share in its benefits. And representing  a district, which,  like the district of  the gentleman  from Missouri,  it  is  clear that rural folks in the past have  not gotten  fair  shares  from other  kinds of jobs bills and other programs  that we have passed in this institution.  I think the gentleman's amendment  is worthy because it addresses those  kinds of inequities.  I salute the gentleman for offering  it.  ",1983

1337,848,18,Mr. ALEXANDER.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I  compliment  the  gentleman from Missouri. I rise in sup port of  the gentleman's amendment  and of this bill.  And while it is the attempt of this  body and of the Congress at large to  bring fairness and equity to all persons  who are eligible for benefits under any  bill that is enacted here, unemploy ment in rural areas has been very dif ficult  to  address. Unemployment  is  just as tragic in the rural areas as it is  in the center cities of our Nation.  The  gentleman's  amendment  im proves upon the equity and fairness of  this bill. I compliment the gentleman  from Missouri.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  H.R. 1036,  the Community Renewal  Employment Act. No amount of ab struse rhetroic or pollyannalike pre dictions about economic recovery can  disguise the fact that too many of our  people are unemployed or underem ployed.  Almost 20 million Americans are in  that fix. That is one out of every six  American workers. What kind of re covery  is possible when  that many  human resources are going wasted? Do  not the proponents of the do-nothing  economics that we have suffered for  the last 3 years realize that there can  be no economic  recovery when  the  work force is crippled to that extent?  Unemployment in America remains  at the highest levels since the Great  Depression. Do not the advocates of  do-nothing economics understand that  recovery for the few cannot,  in the  long run, be purchased at the cost of  misery for the many?  However,  the Community Renewal  Employment Act does more than just  address the problem of lingering eco nomic recession. In its provision for  improvement of our Nation's educational facilities,  it will take practical  measures to address the crisis in edu cation which the President, which the  Congress, which the country at large  have  expressed  so much  concern  about.  Mr. Chairman, do-nothing econom ics, in the final analysis, means indif ferent Government, and it is futile for  the administration to shed crocodile  tears over the state of education in  America while it deprives the educa tional system of the very means for  progress and improvement.  And the Community Renewal Em ployment Act is farsighted in another  respect. It does more than provide a  means for our people to get produc tively back to work. It does more than  commit itself to the beginning of a so lution for our educational problems.  The Community Renewal Employ ment Act addresses itself to the prob lem of social transformation which is  at the heart of our current economic  dilemmas. No group of Americans has  been so ravaged by the last 3 years of  recession as have the men and women  of our rural communities. While the  rest of us in America have undergone  recession and on-again, off-again par tial recoveries threatened by long-term  deficits, rural America has been in the  throes of depression itself.  Under this act, roughly 40 percent of  all  job funding would be allotted to  rural areas suffering high levels of un employment. A significant portion of  this amount would be designated for  consortia or urban and rural communi ties, which would allow an increased  number of rural communities to run  their own job programs than has been  the case under past Federal job cre ation efforts.  And the balance of funds for rural  unemployment would go by formula to  the States for use in those rural local ities where unemployment exceeds the  lower of the State or national average  unemployment rate.  I  endorse  wholeheartedly  the  amendment by  the gentleman  from  Missouri <Mr. VOLKMER) which would  apply the bill's basic allotment formu la to those rural communities which  have no independent job-development  entities. The States would still operate  programs for these communities, but  there would be guaranteed allocation  of funds according  to  the following  formula: One-third on  the  relative  number of unemployed; one-third on  the relative number of unemployment  individuals in excess of 6.5 percent of  the civilian labor force; and one-third  of  the  number  of  unemployed  in  excess of the national average rate of  unemployment.  Mr. Chairman,  this allocation for mula is not only good politics,  it is  good national policy. Let me share  with this body some of the facts of life  of unemployment in my own district,  ",1983
1338,861,18,Mr. MURPHY.," Mr. Chairman,  in  order to  insure  the  integrity of the  Community Renewal Act. special ef forts are necessary to prevent fraud  and other abuses. Strong enforcement  provisions were taken under CETA in  order to insure that employment and  training opportunities are provided on  an equitable basis. In its brief history,  from 1973 to 1982, CETA was amended  8  times and proliferated 12 separate  programmatic  titles, parts, and sub parts. The constant legislative changes  helped strengthen the bill by providing equal employment and training op portunities to all Americans.  However, in any jobs program, there  is  the  danger  of  political  abuses.  Under CETA in fiscal year 1980 an  amendment was enacted into law  to  prevent nepotism, and other discrimi natory hiring practices. This amend ment had the effect of insuring non discrimination and he1ped foster equal  opportunity. To help strengthen the  Community Renewal Act, I am offer ing an enforcement provision to assure  against program abuses, including, but  not limited to nepotism and political  patronage.  In my congressional district, there is  an average unemployment rate of 16.4  percent which  is well above the na tional average. Many of these individ uals are long-term unemployed-many  for 15 weeks or more.  This bill is specifically targeted for  our  long-term unemployed,  and we  want  to make every assurance  that  these  funds  reach  those Americans  who are most devastated by the reces sion. Therefore, the tough, antinepo tism provision  is designed  to  insure  that the funds under the Community  Renewal Employment Act will be used  for the primary purpose of providing  temporary  jobs  to  those  in greatest  need-the long-term unemployed.

1347,861,18,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  off er one additional amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  I  Amendment offered by Mr. WALKER: On  page 61, after line 12, add the following new  section:  SEc. 506. In administering the programs  for which funds are provided by this Act to  promote productive employment, 100 per  centum of the employment created by this  Act shall go to individuals who are classified  as having been unemployed for at least fif teen weeks immediately prior to the date of  individual  application  for  employment  under this Act.  ",1983
1348,861,18,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman, earli er I offered an amendment similar to  this. It is the 100-percent amendment,  trying to assure that all of the money  in the bill will go to people who are  unemployed. The objections raised to  that amendment earlier were that I  had put 6 weeks in instead of 15 weeks  in order to broaden the base of the  number of people unemployed who  would be covered.  So this new amendment goes to 15  weeks and it has the same number of  weeks in it as the bill. In other words,  only people who had been unemployed  for 15 weeks or more would be eligible  for the coverage.  The other objection raised  to  the  amendment at the time that I offered  it was that I had made it applicable as  of the date of the enactment of the  act. Under the new amendment that I  am offering, it would be 15 weeks prior  to the individual application for em ployment  or  for employment under  this act. In other words, once the indi vidual walked in, all he would have to  demonstrate is that he had been un employed for 15 weeks prior to that  application.  In other words, I am trying to meet  the objections that were raised earlier.  but still focus on the fact that I want  the money that is going to be spent  under this act to go to people who are  unemployed and not get siphoned off  as it has been siphoned off in nearly  all the other programs that have been  enacted of  the same nature  in  the  past.  What this amendment attempts to  do is to assure that the money that is  spent for employment goes to the un employed. In this case it will have to  be people who were unemployed for 15  weeks or more. I  think it is a fairly  simple amendment, given the discus sion that we had previously. I do not  think I have to go into all the justifi cations that I made previously. The  Members want  to go home. I would  hope that we could get a vote on it. As  a matter of fact, I hope that the Com mittee might accept this one since it  meets the objections that they have  raised.  ",1983
1349,861,18,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  rise to oppose the amendment.  Chairman,  fortunately  the  amendment moves in the right direc tion; unfortunately,  it does not  im prove  very much  on  the  previous  amendment which was offered.  The first defect in this amendment,  as I can see it as it  is now drafted, is  that  there  are  some  people who  cannot document their work  record.  This is primarily true in the case of  women and youth who do not have a  really documentable work  record  in  Mr.  I  ",1983

And that is  that this: while Congress will debate  this  issue on numerous occasions  in  the days and weeks ahead, the debate  that originates here tonight is a clear  message  to  the  President  of  the  United States.  If he hears that message, if he acts  upon it, if he clarifies his policy in the  Middle East. and more specifically in  Lebanon. by reporting to the Congress  and the American people within the  framework of the War Powers Act. we  will see the emergence of the biparti san support so essential to any success ful  foreign policy.

1352,887,18,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker.  over  the course of  the past several  months this Member from California  has taken the well of the House in a  series of special orders to bring to the  Members  attention the significance of  the huge and horrendous deficit that  faces the Federal Government and our  country as a result essentially of the  Congress.  this House of Representa tives, failing to exercise the responsi bility to cut the spending to meet the  income available, which we should be  doing.  Over the course of these last few  weeks and months during which  I  have taken these special orders, I have  had occasion to read into the record  an  alternative  budget which  this  Member from California prepared and  would have offered to the House for  its consideration and a  vote up or  down in March of this year, but the  Rules Committee refused to give me  the opportunity to do so.  I will  this  evening  conclude  the  series by making reference to some of  the final categories in the 21 categories that comprise our Federal budget  process. I have taken this course for  the purpose of demonstrating to the  Members  that  the  recommended  spending cuts that are contained in  this alternative are not unreasonable.  They are not irrational, and they are  not irresponsible, and to those in this  Chamber who feel that we cannot cut  spending or who do not like the cuts  that this Member from California is  proposing, my response to them is: ""If  you don't like these, what are yours?""  I  think we all have a responsibility  to try to work toward resolving this fi nancial fiscal mess in which we have  collectively placed our country.  In response to a statement that was  made in the other body about the abil ity of our economy to assimilate these  $200  billion dificits  in  the Federal  budget, this comment was made: ""This  economy will find a way to assimilate  these deficits with no sweat."" This is  how one member of the Senate Budget  Committee responded to the spectre of  $1  trillion worth of deficits over the  next 5 years. One of his colleagues,  Senator BILL ARMSTRONG of Colorado,  wrote  to  former Secretary  of  the  Treasury William E. Simon to elicit  his opinion on the relationship of defi cits to the economy. In response, Sec retary Simon quoted Nobel  laureate  Friedrich Hayek:  The only way you can finance a deficit is  by inflation. You cannot raise this amount  of money  by  genuine  borrowing. You  borrow from the banks, which creates credit  for the purpose. A large government deficit  is a certain way to inflation.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to reiterate an other point which Secretary Simon  made, paraphrasing a  former Presi dential adviser: There ought to be two  requirements  before  anyone  could  become  a  Congressman:  First,  he  ought to have taken a basic economics  course;  second,  he  ought  to  have  passed it.  Few  things become as counterpro ductive as  remedial measures which  exist  long after  the problems  they  were  implemented  to solve. It is no  surprise,  then,  the Government pro grams and agencies born of the De pression 50 years ago, with hundreds  more heaped on top of them, have cre ated a vast Federal meatgrinder which  consumes the savings and earnings of  our citizens. And with Government  borrowing devouring virtually every  penny of savings, sustained, noninfla tionary prosperity in the years ahead  will become a dream further and fur ther removed.  It is  tragic,  then, and indeed frus trating, that the response is more of  the same. After all, deficit financing  enables politicians to be all things to  all people, to promise an endless array  of humanitarian programs in order to  insure their own reelection.  The great  and  sinister  irony,  of  course, is that this deficit-induced inflation is the most destructive tax of  all;  it constitutes a cruel and  inhu mane attack on the poor because it  means their tax dollars buy less while  they  are  themselves  pushed  into  higher tax brackets.  0 1930  If we were really concerned about all  of our citizens, we would lighten the  burden which  deficit  spending  im poses. Long ago we  found a  flower  withering in arid soil. We gave it water  so that it might survive and the faucet  has been at  full  force  ever  since,  drowning that flower. We need to let  it breathe a  little. We need  to sur mount our me,  the people, attitude  and break our addiction to remedial  measures with their short-term anal gesia and long-term destructiveness.  We need the long-term cure of excis ing our inflation fueling deficits by re ducing Federal funding.  The Members may recall that of the  21 categories, I had worked through  category 800. This evening I would like  to  begin with  a  category  that  is  famous in our Federal system, catego ry 850, providing ""General Purpose  Fiscal Assistance,""  sometimes called  revenue sharing. If you can believe  this, in 1984 it is projected that in the  day of  a  $200  billion deficit,  it  is  planned to expend $7 billion whereby  Federal borrowing would take place in  the credit markets and will send that  money under  the guise of  revenue  sharing to  local  jurisdictions in this  country. The truth is, we do not have  any revenue to share. We only have  got a deficit, but it is in there.  This  program  that  this Member  from California has  crafted would  reduce that expenditure from $7 bil lion to $3.2 billion, which would result  in a savings in this category of some  $3.8 billion.  In category 852, these changes would  be proposed: District of Columbia, cap ital projects, reduce funding to level  proposed by the President; repayable  advances to the District of Columbia,  terminated  in  accordance with  the  President's proposal.  The next category is net interest, in terest on the national debt, projected  for 1984 at $96 billion. Members may  say,  ""Well, how would you suggest  that we could cut down that interest  expense?""  This is a constructive alternative as  to how we could significantly reduce  the interest expense. During previous  periods when U.S. currency was based  on  the gold standard,  interest rates  averaged 3.6 percent,  from 1879  to  1932, and 2.9 percent from 1933  to  1970. A return to the gold standard  would sharply lower and stabilize in flation, cause interest rates to decline  by 4 to 6 percent and stimulate eco nomic growth,  real growth averaged  8.4 percent following  the restoration  ",1983

1356,900,18,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Ohio for  yielding, and I  thank the gentleman  from California as well for taking this  time and allowing us to have this dis cussion this evening on an issue that I  think is the most critically important  of any problem we could talk about in  our national life at this time.  I am going to focus my remarks on  how we deal with the problem. I think  that previous speakers, both this week  and last week, have done an excellent  job of explaining why deficits are a  problem, and I doubt that there are  any Members in this body, or in the  Senate, or any economists in the coun try who do not agree that the deficit  path we face in the next 5 or 10 years  creates terrible pressures in our econo my and complicates any  reasonable  kind of economic performance.  I think what we need to do is focus  on what we do about it, and I would  like to focus tonight on two problems  that  I  think  the Congress  faces  in  dealing with this issue that make it  very, very difficult. One is a problem  that Congresses  in  the  past  have  always faced, and that is that we in  our democracy over 200 years ago de cided upon  a  system  that diffuses  power today as much as one could dif fuse it.  Our  forefathers  decided  that we  would have a system where the Presi dent would be checked by a committee  of 535, and so to come up with a con sensus on a difficult economic policy  like a budget, we have to have a com mittee of 536 forge a consensus, and  that is a very difficult thing to do. In  effect, we have 536 ideas of how the  budget should be brought into control,  and because of that we  find it very  hard to get a majority in either the  Senate or the House to reach that con trol.  In addition, this is all complicated by  the fact that for the first time in our  congressional history perhaps, other  than in the social security situation,  we  now  are  faced with  politicians  going to the voters every 2 years with  the unenviable  task of taking some thing away from them that was given  to them by previous Congresses per haps as long as 20 years ago.  I think it used to be common in this  body to vote on bills that gave our con stituents things, but in the last few  years. we have had  to  take  things  away, and that is not a happy political  activity.  So all of that together, to me, means  that it is almost an impossible political  situation. We are in a political grid lock. We have the President's idea of  how the budget should be controlled,  we have 535 ideas here, and we have  not enough agreement to make any of  those ideas happen.  I really think that what we need to  do in order to figure out how to tackle  this problem is look at the model that  was offered by the social security con sensus  that was  forged earlier  this  year. I  think it is important because  that is the only time I can remember  in our history when we have as a body  of 536 decided upon a way  to  take  some very  important benefits away  from people. There were  some ele ments in that compromise that I think  are important to look at and to use in  the budget situation.  First, there was political necessity on  the President's part, on the Congress'  part, on Republicans' part, and on  Democrats' part. Everybody  felt an  overwhelming  necessity  to  get  the  problem solved. I am not sure we are  there yet on the deficit. We may not  be there yet until interest rates spike  up or until  the  economic  recovery  starts to abort. I hope we do not have  to wait that long, but I think we prob ably will, until everybody  feels  the  need, the compelling need, the over whelming need,  to do something ex traordinary to solve the problem.  Second, obviously the approach that  was  used  involved  everybody. The  President was represented in the Com mission, and the Congress was repre sented in the Commission. It was obvi ously bipartisan, between Republicans  and Democrats and between the Presi dent and  the Congress, and,  impor tantly, there were outside constituen cies represented on that Commission.  We had both business and labor, as  well as senior groups, that were repre sented at that table, and they felt a  stake in the outcome that was arrived  at.  I think that is an important thing to  remember. I am not so sure that the  President and the Congress alone can  solve this problem and bring off a po litical solution.  Third,  there was a political  truce,  and I do not think we can underesti mate the importance of that. I heard  Members come onto the floor of this  House during the first 5 years I was  here  and  give  speeches  that  they  would never, never cut social security.  We passed resolutions by a vote of 400  to nothing that we would never cut  social security. We passed resolutions  that we would never, never  include  Federal employees in social security.  We  passed  resolutions by votes of  almost 435 to nothing saying that we  would never tax social security bene fits. And  yet Members who made  speeches on behalf of  those  resolu tions stood  in  their of fices here on  Capitol Hill and gave speeches back to  their interest groups saying they were  going to vote for this compromise be cause  a  political  truce  had  been  reached.

1359,900,18,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I will be very brief.  My  point  is  that  a  perception  changed  in Representatives' minds,  and the perception that changed was  that  somehow  they  could vote  for  something to which they were diamet rically  opposed  a  couple  of  years  before because there was a perception  that they could vote for it and not be  irreparably damaged politically since  there has been a political armistice on  this important  issue. They felt  that  they could vote for it and have a hope  of being reelected again. I think that  we are kidding ourselves if we think  anybody is going to vote for a budget  compromise, with all  the pain  in it  that we know has  to exist, without  that perception being changed.  Fourth,  there has  to be an even  pain. A  lot of Members here have  talked about how defense has done  this or  that and how entitlements  have done this or that. Let us not kid  ourselves. In social security the pain  was evenly divided over 75 years be tween tax increases that hurt the tax payers and benefit cuts that hurt the  recipients. It has got to be the same  kind of arrangement here. The same  philosophy has to be followed in work ing out a budget compromise.  And last, and perhaps as important  as any of it, was the fact that once  that compromise was arrived at by the  Commission and all  the parties had  signed off, that package came to the  Congress and was passed without any  significant change. That is the way it  has  to be done here, because  if we  come back and start changing it-and  believe me, we will still have 535 ideas  about how it should be changed once  we have got it-we have got to hold  hands and hold those hands tight and  not change one word of  it, because  once the elements of the society that  have to be at the table have signed off  on it, they have to stick. They have to  stick  through  the whole  process,  ",1983
1360,913,18,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  with great sadness that I rise today to  pay tribute to four of the victims of  KAL flight 007 who resided in my con gressional district. I commend my col league, Mr. McCANDLESS, for allowing  us the opportunity to honor the vic tims of this tragedy.  The realization that four of my con stituents-Edgardo and Frisca Cruz of  Irvington, N.J. and Eusebio and Maria  N. Bolante of East Orange-were pas sengers on  the plane brought  the  entire incident to an even more per sonal note. In addition to my feelings  of outrage about this terrible action, I  could also feel the personal pain and  anguish of the Cruz and Bolante fami lies.  For the Cruz family, the tragedy was  compounded by the fact that at the  time of her death, Frisca Cruz was  trying to reunite her family in Amer ica, and wanted to bring six of her  children who lived in the Philippines  to this country. Her oldest son, who is  an American citizen, asked for my help  in continuing his mother's dream of  bringing her children here. With the  assistance of Attorney General Wil liam French Smith, we are successful ly arranging for the Cruz children to  come to America. This was, of course,  the least that we could do for the vic tims of this senseless tragedy.  Mr. Speaker, words are not suffi cient to express our sorrow and sour  sympathy to all of the victims' fami lies. I hope that they know, however,  that our thoughts are with them in  this time of grief.e  ",1983
1361,913,18,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker, for 21  days the world has mourned the sense less deaths of 269 people who were  ruthlessly killed when the Soviets shot  down Korean Air Lines flight 007. The  Soviet action demonstrates a blatant  disregard for human life and there is  absolutely no  justification for shoot ing down an unarmed civilian plane. It  is an outrage that these lives were so  brutally taken.  Individuals of 14 nationalities  lost  their lives on that airliner. Sixty-one  of  these were U.S.  citizens. One of  them lived in my congressional district  in Montgomery County, Md. His name  was John Rochester Oldham.  John Oldham was 27 years old when  that flight went down. He had grad uated from Princeton and Columbia  Law School. He had won a Fulbright  scholarship and studied in Geneva. He  had worked for two Washington, D.C.,  law firms, and a  serious  interest in  international affairs prompted him to  make plans to study Chinese language  and law at Beijing University.  When I reflect upon the life of John  Oldham, and upon the loss of these  269 lives, I feel personally the impact  of this tragedy and realize how much  we, as Americans, have lost and what  the world has lost. John Oldham has  been described by  friends  as  ""very  warm"" and ""really committed to       helping people."" It is clear that he had  a very significant influence on people's  lives. He was making his way and pur suing the goals that were important to  him. He was an individual who made a  difference.  This is what the United States is all  about. Whether one calls it democra cy, or human rights, or freedom, or  justice, there is, associated with each,  a fundamental respect for the individ ual and  the highest regard for  the  worth of individual potential. Having  opportunities,  developing  potential,  pursuing  interests, def ending  ideals,  working  toward  a  goal,  committing  oneself for a purpose; these are all the  basis for positive change in our own  society and are the avenues that each  of us take to make a contribution to  the world around us. John Oldham  was doing this.  John Oldham was good to people; he  helped them. He went out of his way,  delaying  his  departure  from  the  United States, to find housing for vis iting Chinese  scholars, after others  had failed to find housing. He wanted  to be  involved with people and do  what he could  to make  their way  easier.  John Oldham promoted understand ing. He was committed to working in  international affairs  and he under stood  the value and  importance of  learning about people, cultures, coun tries very different from our own. He  realized how languages can open the  door  to an appreciation and under standing of the world.  John Oldham was moving forward.  He knew what was important in life  and went after it. He had a good edu cation, but wanted to learn more.  One of John Oldham's law profes sors described him <as he is quoted in  the Washington Post> like this:  He was the very definition of outgoing very warm, gregarious, sunny. He always  had a smile for everyone.  Just as soon as we received confirmation  ... we just all thought it could not end this  way, for someone who was so vibrant and  thought friendship was the best way.  e Mr.  It is a great  tragedy  that such a  promising young man was killed.  I  wish  I  could have known him; we  shared a strong interest in internation al affairs and had both studied  in  Geneva. Moreover, it appears that he  was a wonderful human being.  John Oldham would have, most cer tainly,  helped  to make  this world  better. He had so much to offer. My  own hope is that we will remember his  commitment and let his life be an in spiration to all of us.e  ANDREWS  of  Texas. Mr.  Speaker, last week the House unani mously passed a resolution condemn ing the Soviet Union's cold, calculated,  and criminal destruction of KAL 007.  The resolution clearly expressed our  Nation's outrage that 269 innocent ci vilians have been murdered  in  the  name of protecting the sacred airspace  of the Soviet Union. But to just say  that  there were 269  civilian deaths  does not explain the extent of the loss.  Each one of those 269 people killed  had a personal history and story, and  their deaths will haunt the lives of  their friends, families, and coworkers.  Specifically, we have  lost a gifted  student who could have taken an earli er plane, but stayed behind in New  York a couple of extra days in order to  help a recently arrived exchange stu dent find a place to live. We lost a  young widowed mother who was on  her way to visit her parents. We lost a  distinguished judge and civil rights ac tivist, as well as businessmen, whole  families,  engineers,  doctors,  and  a  Member of Congress. Our outrage will  eventually subside as we resume our  work and daily  lives. But for many,  the loss of KAL 007 is a very personal  loss from which they will never com pletely recover.  Almost as outrageous as the downing  of the plane itself are the words and  deeds of the Soviets in the aftermath  of this tragedy. The Soviets have re sponded to the world's outrage with  falsehoods  and  absurd  accusations.  Initially, in the face of clear evidence  to the contrary, the Soviets claimed  that  they had not shot down  the  plane. They then claimed it was a spy  plane and that they had confused the  747 with an RC-135, a military recon naissance aircraft. The 747  is one of  the world's best known and most rec ognizable aircraft.  The distinctive shape of its fuselage,  as well as its sheer size, clearly differ entiate  it from  the RC-135 or any  other aircraft currently flying. Fur",1983
1362,926,18,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, all of  those of us who live in the archdiocese  of New Yq_rk are saddened by the news  that our spiritual leader Terence Car dinal Cooke is terminally ill with leu kemia. This sadness goes far beyond  the parameters of the archdiocese and  is  shared by Pope John Paul and  President Reagan-each of whom com municated their sentiments to Cardi nal Cooke.  Since  1968,  Cardinal Cooke  has  served as the leader of the archdiocese  of New York which has some 1.8 mil lion Roman Catholics. Further Cardi nal Cooke also serves as our Nation's  Roman Catholic military vicar.  Terence Cardinal Cooke has been a  priest since his ordination on Decem ber 1, 1945. He taught at both Catho lic and Fordham Universities and by  the year 1957 he was named as person al secretary to his predecessor Cardi nal Spellman. By 1965 he was ordained  as an auxiliary bishop.  He was  installed as archbishop of  New York on April 4, 1968, with Presi dent Lyndon B. Johnson  in attend ance. Cardinal Cooke has counseled all  of  the President's who have served  during his years as archbishop and has  been especially close to both President  and Mrs. Reagan.  Terence Cardinal Cooke is a native  New Yorker having been born on the  upper West Side of Manhattan. He  knows New York as well as anyone  having visited its neighborhoods and  seen its people for many years. At one  time in 1945 Cardinal Cooke was as signed as assistant pastor at St. AthanEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  asius Church in the Bronx. Cardinal  Cooke despite his national and inter national prominence and position has  always felt most comfortable in New  York.  Cardinal Cooke  is viewed by those  who have known him as a patient,  compassionate, and highly intelligent  man more content with being in the  role of a pastor than a church admin istrator.  I have  the personal honor  and privilege to have known Cardinal  Cooke for many years found his coun sel invaluable to me personally. One of  the proudest pictures  I have  in my  office  is with Cardinal Cooke  and  former President Gerald R. Ford at  the annual Al Smith dinner in New  York City.  Cardinal Cooke once said his main  goal was  to be a  ""good priest."" He  gained a reputation over these past 15  years as a master conciliator. He has  also maintained a remarkably close re lationship  to  the  individual  people  who make up his massive archdiocese.  He has been one of the most accessible  and visible of all cardinals  in  this  Nation. This tradition of maintaining  close touch with people also has car ried into his work in the archdiocese.  Few positions which Cardinal Cooke  has taken over the years have come  without  the benefit of consultation  with  individual  priests  and pastors  from within the archdiocese.  It is impossible to predict how much  longer Cardinal Cooke will live. He has  been administered with last rites by  the church. His spokesman has said  that the cardinal is taking the news  ""with faith and peace of soul."" He is  continuing to work and attend to his  responsibilities.  The people of New York have been  blessed by Cardinal Cooke through his  work. There are few people who have  given so much of themselves for their  fellow man  than Cardinal Cooke.  Whether he provided counsel or solace  to an individual parishioner or to a  fighting man overseas or to a Chief  Executive, Cardinal Cooke was a man  of  commitment  and  compassion.  I  have had the distinct honor of being  in the company of Cardinal Cooke on  numerous occasions. I have been en riched as a person because of having  known this man. There are few people  who will be missed more than Cardinal  Cooke.  It has been said that death, like life,  is a gift of God. Cardinal Cooke's life  was a gift to the millions who know  him and join with me in praying that  the cardinal live his remaining days in  peace and without suff ering.e  September 21, 1983  THE 200TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRA TION OF THE TOWN OF CHES TER, MASS.  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE ~OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 21, 1983  e ",1983
1363,926,18,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to con gratulate the board of selectmen, the  bicentennial  committee,  and  the  townspeople of the beautiful commu nity of Chester, Mass., on the occasion  of their 200th birthday.  Chester is a lovely rural community  that is nestled among the rolling hills  of Hamden County. Flowing through  its green valley are the western and  middle branches of the Agawam River.  Throughout its history, Chester has  typified  the struggle and enlighten ment of the early New England set tlers. Hardy men and women coming  to this raw country with nothing more  than a  few  tools and animals, built  farms  and  homes with  their  own  hands.  As New England progressed toward  the industrial age, Chester townspeo ple developed small industries. Typical  of these were mining, papermills, wood  products factories all built around the  natural  resources  that abounded  in  the area. The residents utilized well  the  ingenuity ascribed  to New Eng landers.  Politically, the townspeople of Ches ter mirrored  the opinions of  their  fell ow colonists. Men of Chester joined  the fight for freedom early in the Re voluntionary War.  Today, Chester remains intact, as a  symbol of the bucolic lifestyle inher ent to the countryside of Massachu setts. The current population of 1,100  reflects the changing times. Many of  Chester's residents commute to jobs in  nearby cities,  but return home each  evening to enjoy the rural lifestyle.  Chester is still home to farmers. It  numbers among  its  residents artists  and artisans. These groups continue  the traditions of the past while accom modating the technology of today.  The schedule of the bicentennial f es tival exemplifies the varied interests  and concerns of the citizens of Ches ter. The 2-day schedule included arts  and crafts exhibits, performing arts  presentations,  agricultural  displays,  community group performances, spe cial children's events, and popular en tertainment.  To  the people of Chester,  I  com mend you for your respect of tradi tions and your accomplishments of  today. I extend my sincerest congratu lations to you on this most glorious oc casion.   ",1983
1364,1017,18,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, this  omnibus authorization measure pro vides authority for activities conduct ed  by many  organizations. Among  these organizations is one of the small est units in the Federal Gc1vernment,  the International Boundary Commis sion, which deals with matters be tween the United States and Canada.  During the August recess, NBC news  revealed that this tiny commission, un beknownst to the public and this Con gress, used a herbicide known as agent  orange to maintain a 36-mile-long, 20foot-wide clear cut strip of  land  in  Maine and New Hampshire along the  Canadian border. This defoliant was  used by  the Commission as  late as  1978, over 6 years after its use was dis continued  in Vietnam  for  health  safety reasons.  The jury is still out on the specific  results to personal health from direct  exposure  to agent orange. However,  sufficient evidence exists to conclude  that the risks posed by this mixture of  chemicals clearly outweighs its bene fits as a defoliant.  Technically, agent orange is a mix ture  of  two  primary  ingredients,  2,4,5,T and 2,4,D (2,4,5-trichlorophen oxyacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenox yacetic acid) and a  third component,  TCDD  < 2,3, 7 ,8-tetrachlorodibenzo para-dioxin).  The TCDD, a contaminant which is  produced during the manufacture of  2,4,5,T,  is  the part of .the m~~ture  which is so dangerous. Skin conditions,  cancer, nervousness, birth defects, and  numbness in the extremities all may  result  from direct exposure  to  this  dangerous toxin.  As a member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs which  is  studying  the agent orange problem, I was ex tremely concerned when I  learned of  the NBC  report. My  concern was  heightened  when  I  subsequently  learned that because of the passage of  time little or nothing can be done by  the Federal Government to even meas ure the degree to which dioxins origi nating in the herbicide may have pen etrated the soil, water table, and wa tershed in the affected area. It was at  that point that I decided to seek a con gressional statement on the  issue in  the  form of an amendment  to  the  pending bill.  The amendment which  I  propose  with Senator STAFFORD will place clear ly on record,  the views of Congress  concerning boundary commission use  of herbicides containing dioxins.  The first section of the amendment  flatly prohibits the use of such herbi cides by any  international commis sions authorized by the bill.  The second section will insure that  Congress is vigilant in the future. It  stipulates that boundary commissions  may not use any herbicides unless  they provide prior notice to the Gover nor of the affected State, the Commit tee on Foreign Relations of the Senate  and the Committee on Environment  and Public Works of the Senate.  In addition,  the second section  is  clear as to what such a notification  should contain. It shall include first,  the name of the herbicide; second, an  estimate of the quantity of herbicide  planned for use;  third, an identifica tion of the area on which the herbi cide will be used; and fourth, a descrip tion of the herbicide's chemical com position.  Mr. President,  the  administration  should have no complaint with  this  amendment. This  is because  its pri mary component-the prohibition sec tion-reflects what  is currently  the  policy of the International Boundary  Commission. In approving this amend ment, the Senate will be saying that it  concurs with that current policy and  does not want  that policy changed  without the Congress being involved  in the decision.  I  understand, Mr. President,  that  this amendment has been cleared and  that the floor managers will, I hope,  see  fit  to  accept  this  amendment,  which  is  the  first of  three amend ments, Mr. President, which I have to  offer.

1373,1017,18,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, this  amendment concerns section 106 of  the bill, added by the Senator from  South Dakota <Mr. PRESSLER)  in the  Committee on Foreign Relations.  Section 106 expresses the sense of  the Senate on the need to facilitate  U.S. exports by opposing international  restrictions on the marketing and dis tribution of U.S goods. It is intended  to direct U.S. Government representa tives to various international organiza tions to oppose all proposed marketing  and  distribution  regulations which  might harm U.S. industries seeking to  export their commodities, goods, and  services.  My problem with section 106 does  not concern what it contains, but what  it omits. The fact is that its emphasis  is on the need to create an interna tional trade environment under which  U.S. agricultural commodities may be  easily exported. My concern  is  that  our country's other  important  food  producing sector, the fishing industry,  is not even mentioned.  I support fully the view, often ex pressed by the distinguished assistant  majority  leader,  the senior Senator  from Alaska <Mr. STEVENS), that great er Government appreciation should go  to this important industry.  Those  Americans  who  harvest  marine resources are far less organized  than those who work the soil and raise  livestock. Though the fishing industry  has responded to the challenges of the  last decade by increasing its focus on  Government policies which affect it,  the  industry has a  long way  to go  before it comes close to claiming its  proper share of attention from Feder al policymakers.  As the representative of an extreme ly important segment of the American  f:iShing  industry,  I have pledged  to  fishing harvesters and processors  in  the State of Maine to do everything I  can to permit their traditional way of  life to survive and flourish. One way  that those of us who represent fisher men and processors of fish products is  to try and win for the industry a corre sponding share of the attention which  this Congress and  the Federal bu reaucracy directs toward American ag riculture.  The amendment  I  am offering at  this point should be considered a part  of  this  effort.  In  the  preambular  clause of section 106, I add the term  ""fisheries commodities""  the con gressional finding that ""      in an in creasingly interdependent world econ omy, Government measures that reto  ",1983
1374,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," I am very happy to re spond to my distinguished colleague. I  attended a  full day meeting at the  State Department with the AFL-CIO,  the U.S. Chamber, the Democratic na tional chairman, and the Republican  chairman discussing every aspect of  this. We had been preceded by similar  smaller meetings, each of  them on  their own working together to bring  the best that they could before that  full-day meeting.  The Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee  subsequently had  a  day of  hearings on the matter. We had pro  and con. Those hearings could be  made available  to  the distinguished  Senator.  Some critics in the House debate did  charge that this was a hastily con ceived measure  and  represented  a  single ideological viewpoint. The ques tion obviously that we asked ourselves  was, ls that true? And I came up with  the answer that it ls not true in the  least.  The bill emerged from a year-long  effort. It was a year-long effort by the  American Political Foundation's de mocracy program study and research  group. That group included as cochalr men the two political party chairmen,  Lane Kirkland of the AFL-CIO, Am bassador Michael Samuels of the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce.  representa tives of both the House and Senate.  and conservatives. moderates, and li~  erals among its board members as well.  Even a hasty scrutiny of its report will  indicate the research included exten sive assessment of the ability of pri vate sector U.S. organjmtions to assist  democratic development  throughout  the world The research staff either  traveled to or met with political lead ers of all democratic persuasions, con servative soclallsts from over 50 differ ent countries. The  interim program  will go  has been available ever since April.  And when I make my own comments, I  into some considerable detail  about the studies that have been made  because the Federal Republic of Ger many has operated in over five dozen  countries  for  the past  few decades  without a major  inciden.t and with  complete success.  So it ls almost a federal system. We  have other examples to draw from, to  note and to draw from their experi ence how successful this project can  be made.  ",1983
1375,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President,  the  Senator did not answer my question.  He gave a long, involved answer, but  my question was, the report was an in terim report, was it not? Since it was,  what has happened to the final ver sion?  ",1983
1376,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," The report was labeled  as an interim report and there has not  been submitted,  to  the best of my  knowledge, a final report. I can find  out within a matter of an hour when  that final report will be available.  ",1983
1377,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," I assume, then, that  the Senator ls asking Congress to au thorize $25.5 million on the basis of a  report that has not yet been made fi nally to the committee.  ",1983
1378,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," From what  I under stand, there ls not going to be a basic  difference between  the  final  report  and the interim report. The interim  report was considered a  fairly com plete report. We shall find out within  a matter of minutes what has hap pened to that final report and why we  do not have it available today.  ",1983
1379,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP., But the authors have  gotten money since the interim report  for a final report which is not going to  be substantially different. What use  did they make of the money if they  were not going to make any further  substantive work?  ,1983
1380,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," I can assure my col league that, within a matter of min utes. I can give him a full answer as to  why we do not have available in front  of us the final report or if the final  report. when it is submitted, will differ  in any major respect from the interim  report.  ",1983
1381,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," In a sense, what the  Senator is telling me is that the quar ter of a million dollars that they spent  between  the  interim and  the  final  report was not necessary.  ",1983
1382,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," I can give the Senator  assurance whether or not that conclu sion will be reached by the final report  within a few minutes. I would be as tounded, because the Members I have  had contact with in making up this  report are more enthusiastic than ever  about the result of what I consider to  be a modest sum. a pittance compared  to what the Soviet Union is spending  to sell their system. The Soviet Union  has denounced it by every mechanism  that they can marshal. I a.'""""1 always inls  terested in a project that ls denounced  as strongly as this ls by the Soviets.  ",1983
1383,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," If the Senator would  permit me, I would be, too, but per haps they are denouncing it for differ ent reasons than would I.  I suspect  they object  to  the  purpose. They  should.  I have no quarrel with the purpose. I  have a great deal of quarrel with the  instrument that has been put before  us.  ",1983
1384,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, could I  Just point out the size of the interim  report?  ",1983
1385,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," Size has  little  rel evance to the question that I asked, in  all due respect.  Let me further ask the Senator in  what ways the USIA, with its budget  of  two-thirds of $1 billion,  inad equate for the pursuit of these same  goals.  ",1983
1386,1030,18,Mr. PERCY., The question being  why is not the budget of USIA as it  now stands adequate  to absorb  this  project?  ,1983
1387,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP., Are not the goals pre cisely  those  enumerated  in  section  403?  ,1983
1388,1030,18,Mr. PERCY., All I can say is that the  budget of USIA was  inadequate  to  expand and extend its facilities and its  transmissions  to even approach  the  transmission capabilities of the Soviet  Union.  ,1983
1389,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.," $25 million  is not  going to change that. Broadcasting is  not at issue here.  PERCY. We  just  added,  in  Radio Marti, $54.8 million in 1985 in  order to modernize those facilities.  ",1983
1390,1030,18,Mr. WALLOP.,"  I  understand, but  that is not the thrust of my question.  My question is, If we have an estab lished function to do those things-I  read from section 403<a>:  Mr.  the purpose of the Endow SEC. 403. <a>  ment are< 1> to encourage free and democratic insti tutions throughout the world through pri vate sector  initiatives,  including activities  which promote  the  individual  rights and  freedoms which are essential to the func tioning of democratic institutions;  Is  that not  the  function of  the  USIA? Is that not part of their target?  ",1983
1391,1030,18,Mr. PERCY.," Let me just use an il lustration. Why is it that we have con tinually depended more and more on  the private volunteer organization in  foreign aid-Catholic Relief, Save the  Children-and are putting more and  more of our Government funds  into  those organizations? For one reason:  They can do a better job. They have a  huge structure behind them. They get  an expertise and a point of view that  bureaucrats, sitting here in Washing ton. good as they may be, simply do  not get.  What we are saying is that USIA, for  something as important as this, should  really go not to the bureaucrats who  are sitting there, some of whom have  ",1983

1402,1043,18,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President,  this is the amendment that I offered  the other day when we were consider the  resolution  relating  to  the  Soviet action against the Korean air liner.  This amendment was part of  the  package that had been submitted by  the Senator from North Carolina <Mr.  HELMs> on that same date and was in cluded in a similar fashion in a pack age offered too by the Senator from  North Carolina. Because of the simi larities of his,  it  is being presented  now on my behalf and on behalf of the  Senator from North Carolina, Senator  HELMs, Senator GOLDWATER, Senator  LEAHY, Senator BOREN, Senator EXON,  Senator DECONCINI, Senator Snn.s:s,  Senator McCLURE,  Senator  JEPSEN,  Senator  INOUYE,  Senator DOMENICI,  Senator ABDNOR, Senator GARN, Sena tor FoRD, Senator DENTON, Senator  NICKLES, and Senator CHILES.  Mr. President, this amendment ex presses the sense of the Congress that  there should be substantial equiva lence between the number of Soviet  Government personnel in the United  States and the number of U.S. Gov ernment  personnel  in  the  Soviet  Union, and that restrictions and condi tions be  imposed on Soviet Govern ment personnel in the United States  that are comparable to those restric tions  imposed on U.S. Government  personnel in the Soviet Union.  In  Mr. President, we believe that this  action is long overdue and fully Justi fied without regard to recent events.  Nevertheless,  the horrendous act of  the Soviet Union in shooting down an  unarmed commercial airliner and kill ing 269 innocent people makes it espe cially appropriate and necessary for  the Congress to place itself on record  with regard to the disparity in num bers and treatment between Soviet of ficial  representation  in  the United  States and U.S. official representation  in the Soviet Union.  This amendment calls on the Presi dent to take the necessary steps, as  soon as is practicable after the enact ment of this legislation, to insure sub stantial  equivalence  between  the  number of Soviet Government em ployees representing the Soviet Union  in the United States and the number  of U.S. Government employees repre senting the United States in the Soviet  Union. The amendment also calls on  the President to insure that the same  or comparable restrictions and condi tions are imposed on the travel, ac commodations, and facilities of Soviet  Government employees in the United  States as are imposed by the Govern ment of  the Soviet Union on  the  travel, accommodations, and facilities  of U.S. Government employees in the  Soviet Union.  addition,  the  amendment  ex presses the desire of the Congress that  the President report to the Congress  on actions  taken  to carry out  this  amendment, together with recommen dations for any additional legislation  that may be necessary  to carry out  this amendment.  The ultimate result of this amend ment, when implemented by the Presi dent, should have been achieved re gardless of the Soviet action against  the Korean airliner. Why should the  official presence of the Soviets in the  United States greatly exceed our Gov ernment's official  presence  in  the  Soviet Union? This parity involves not  only the numbers of personnel in each  country but, equally to our disadvan tage, the disparity in freedom of move ment,  living  accommodations,  and  working facilities. The conditions for  our country's representatives  in  the  U.S.S.R. are abysmal in comparison to  the way the Soviet Government's rep resentatives are treated in this coun try.  This amendment seeks to reduce the  total number of positions available to  the Soviet Government  for placing  trained  intelligence  officers  in  the  United States. What we are seeking,  frankly, is to make it more difficult for  them to obtain intelligence informa tion while, at the same time, achieving  a  general balance between our Na tion's  representation  in  the Soviet  Union and their representation here.

1403,1056,18,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, the Sen ator  from Kansas  has  offered  an  amendment  that few of us  in  this  Chamber have had a chance to study  as it was only announced today. I un derstand that the Foreign Relations  Committee has not had a chance to  consider it and that it is opposed by  the Reagan administration. It would  make drastic, across-the-board cuts in  our contributions to the United Na tions and  several of  its  specialized  agencies. While there may be a case to  be made that these organizations are  inefficient, frustrating, and wasteful,  an amendment proposing such drastic  cuts must present that case convinc ingly, and that has not been done in  this case. I might be willing to support  cutbacks in our contributions to these  organizations if it were clear that our  funds are only supporting bureaucrat ic structures which do no good for the  paor  and  the  hungry  around  the  world, but I am not yet convinced that  that is true.  It is also  important  to  remember  that while the United Nations is often  used as a forum to criticize the United  States, it is also a forum where world  opinion can be shaped to oppose and  condemn such atrocities as the Soviet  invasion of Afghanistan and the bar baric destruction of the Korean Air  Lines 747. If we want to maintain or  better still increase our influence in  the community of nations, making  sudden, deep cuts in our contributions  to the organizations which bring all  the nations of the world together to  work on solutions  to common prob lems  is not  the course we  should  follow at this time.e  e ",1983
1404,1056,18,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  strongly support Senator KAssEBAUM's  amendment  to  reduce 1984  funding  earmarked for certain U.N. funding to  the 1980 level of funding, with further  decreases in the next 3 years.  The Secretary-General of the United  Nations  in his  latest  report admits  that there has often been very poor  oversight of spending in the many pro grams of that organization. There has  often been, the report suggests, an in adequate control of spending on many  levels. It appears that there exist few  safeguards against poor fiscal manage ment in the United Nations.  It is often not publicized that sala ries and benefits of U.N. employees  dwarf United States and international  earnings averages. Additionally,  few  questions are asked about the costs of  U.N.  programs  and whether  those  costs produce  the promised  results.  This amendment causes us  to  face  squarely the fact that funds now paid  to the United Nations could more ef fectively  and humanely be utilized  elsewhere. By reducing the 1984 fund ing to 1980 levels and further reducing  that figure by 10 percent each year for  3  years,  the United States would  retain several hundred million dollars.  That amount of savings is not insub stantial and could be valuably applied  in any number of areas, including use  in domestic programs and reduction of  the Federal deficit.  This amendment does not put our  position in the United Nations in jeop ardy as has been charged. The reduced  payments would be designated as pay ments in full, thus avoiding the possi bility of fines by the United Nations  for averages. In our Federal budget we  face  the necessity of spending con trols. If the United States is to provide  a large portion of U .N. funds, that or ganization must tighten its spending  also.e  ",1983

Millicent's life for the last two dec ades has been testament to her com mitment  to  improving  the  lives of  those  around  her-starting  as  a  member of her local borough council,  then as chairman of the Governor's  Committee on Equal Employment Op portunity, as cochairman of New Jer sey's bipartisan conference on  civil  rights, as director of the New Jersey  Division of Consumer Affairs, and fi nally,  in  her  8-year  career  as  a  Member of Congress.  Millicent also has  the  remarkable  ability to get people to like her and  admire her. Combined with her deter mination and dedication, I am sure we  will have a potent  force  for action  when we confirm Millicent Fenwick  and start her on yet another exempla ry career in public service.  ",1983
1420,1069,18,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased that the Senate is set to  approve the nomination of Millicent  Fenwick to be Ambassador and U.S.  Representative to the Food and Agri culture Organizations of  the United  Nations in Rome. While in the Con gress, Mrs. Fenwick was a strong force  for  the poor and disadvantaged  in  countries  throughout  the world.  I  know she will bring the same compas sion and experience  to bear  in  this  often neglected, yet vital part of our  international relations.  The United States traditionally has  played a key role in world food and ag ricultural problem solving,  including  food and agricultural research and de velopment, the furtherance of food se curity in the Third World, and in gen eral economic development. Our con tributions go  far beyond emergency  relief to assistance in providing a safe,  nutritious, and reliable food supply for  every person in every country.  Still, there may be as many as 600million people each day in developing  countries who do not have access to  enough food to meet their nutritional  needs. According to food and agricul ture organizations and World Health  Organization figures, that is about 46  percent of  the  total population  in  those developing countries.  Whether the problem is one simply  of insufficient food supply or one of  inadequate access or distribution of  food,  there is a need for the United  States  to provide bold leadership  in  the international effort to find solu tions. We need an Ambassador-level  appointee to focus our efforts in this  regard. Our country will be well served  by an experienced and committed indi vidual like Mrs. Fenwick to press for ward these programs, both in Rome  and here in Washington, D.C.  ",1983

1452,1108,18,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, I was  disturbed  to hear some of my col leagues suggest here  today  that we  shift some of the funds out of the Ful bright exchange program.  I hope my colleagues will resist any  effort  to  take as much as $1  away  from this noble and effective program.  The record of the program speaks  for itself and needs little defense from  me. But let me just remind my col leagues of what the program stands  for and what it has achieved.  After World War II, Senator J. Wil liam Fulbright introduced legislation  authorizing our Government  to use  proceeds from the sale of surplus war  property to finance the exchange of  students and teachers. That program  has expanded  in funding and scope  over the years, but its goal remains un changed: To promote understanding  between  nations  and  to  create  or  strengthen  ties on an  individual as  well as governmental level.  I do not think we should underesti mate  the value of personal contact  among  the citizens of different na tions.  It  destroys  misconceptions,  eliminates  prejudices,  and  creates  bonds of friendship and understand ing.  The Soviets understand these bene fits, and that is why they and their  allies have stepped up their efforts in  this area  far beyond anything  the  United States has ever done.  Two years ago when the Senate was  discussing the funding of international  exchange programs, the Senator from  Connecticut, Mr. WEICKER, made  a  magnificent speech, in which he de scribed the exchange program spon sored by the Cubans. Senator WEICKER  described a visit to Cuba, where he saw  600 Namibian high school students re ceiving an education-or should we say  indoctrination-at the hands of that  Soviet satellite. I believe that it it is  safe  to say that those students will  return  to  their  native  country  as  strong  friends of  the Soviet-Cuban  system. I don't how many Namibian  students we have here in the United  States, but I daresay that there are  not many.  My colleagues should not speak of  reducing Fulbright  funding;  instead,  we should be offering amendments to  increase that funding. Let me say how  pleased I am that the Congress voted 2  years ago  to double USIA's interna tional exchange programs by 1986.  Make no mistake: International ex change programs are in our best inter est, especially if we use them to expose  young people from nondemocracies to  our institutions. Democracy must be  observed and experienced to be under stood and appreciated. We take many  of  the  blessings  of  democracy  for  granted, but the workings of our sys tems will make a lasting impression on  a young student who has not been ex posed to the freedoms that we enjoy.  The  investment we make  in  these  programs now will reap an outstand ing return later. If you need proof, let  me  point out  that  a  1980  survey  showed that 33 heads of state and 378  cabinet-level ministers had studied or  visited in the United States under the  aegis of our educational exchange pro grams. Among those participants we  find such leaders as Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain,  President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,  former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of  Austria,  former Chancellor Helmut  Schmidt of West Germany, and Prime  Minister Indira Gandhi of India.  The Fulbright program has a special  place in my heart because of my per sonal admiration for the former Sena tor from Arkansas and chairman of  the Foreign Relations Committee, who  had the foresight 35 years ago to es tablish  the  framework  that would  result in so many links between this  country and leaders abroad.  Senators should look at the record  and resist any efforts to cut back our  international exchange programs.  SYRIA-LIBYA AMENDMENTS  e ",1983

1454,1121,18,Mr. NATCHER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. RATCHFORD).  ",1983
1455,1121,18,Mr. RATCHFORD.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of this vital legislation  and commend Chairman NATCHER, the  gentleman  from Massachusetts <Mr.  CONTE) and the other members and  staff of the subcommittee for developing a bill that is responsive to the real  needs of millions of Americans, young  and old alike.  For  the older American,  I would  draw my colleagues' attention to two  items contained in the bill. First, there  is $317 million for senior employment  under title 5 of the Older Americans  Act, enough to maintain the 62,500 job  slots currently available. This program  has clearly been one of the most suc cessful in both creating jobs for older  Americans and placing these men and  women in permanent positions. This is  an essential jobs program for an age  group that suffered a tremendous in crease in unemployment over the last  few years.  For State  inspection  of  nursing  homes  serving medicare  recipients,  there is $40, 700,000. In its budget re quest,  the  administration  assumed  that it would cut back on the frequen cy of quality and safety inspections of  nursing homes. As a former commis sioner on aging  from Connecticut I  know what a dangerous risk we would  be taking by cutting back on nursing  home inspections for a savings of only  about $4 million, and I applaud the  committee for seeing fit to reject this  shortsighted proposal.  For younger people and their fami lies, the committee has done an excel lent  job  in developing a  responsible  student assistance package that may  gain approval  from  the administra tion. The committee has funded the  five major.____student aid programs with  a $130 million increase over the cur rent appropriation, and has also  in cluded funds to keep the guaranteed  student loan program going in its cur rent form.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman, mem bers, and staff of the subcommittee  have made a  silk purse out of  the  budget request. This bill deserves our  approval  and,  eventually,  the Pres ident's signature.  Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, just to complete the  record,  I  did not get all  I wanted,  either. And  like  the rest of us, we  simply shared in the excellent leader ship of our distinguished chairman,  BILL NATCHER, and ou.r ranking minori ty member. SILVIO CONTE. Candidly.  their leadership has been outstanding.  This is one of the most difficult bills  to consider because the decisions that  are made are always tough, every pro gram  is deserving, and  the  issue  is  living within your means.  I would like to draw my colleagues'  attention to a few programs which I  believe are of special interest.  First of all, in the area of care re search, we have provided $8 million  for nursing research, which is an in crease of $3 million over  the  fiscal  year 1983  level,  to support approxi mately 75 research projects.

Mr. Chairman, there are two argu ments, regardless of one's position on  abortion, that in my view should never  be used.  For those who favor either the con cept of abortions or Government fund ing for them, it is that because there  will be fewer poor born or fewer of a  minority born. That is an immoral ar gument  that should not  touch  this  House.  Equally wrong is the argument from  those who oppose abortions that chil dren are needed to somehow assume a  debt or somehow are needed because  they must function in an army or they  are needed in a nation only for their  use. A child deserves one  thing at  birth, and  that  is  love. Neither of  those arguments, for or against, add  that to it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

1462,1147,18,Mrs. LLOYD.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to clear  up any ambiguity.  I would  like  to  make it very clear that I am support ing the Hyde amendment.  ",1983
1463,1147,18,Mr. SILJANDER.," Mr. Chairman, I  would like to clarify three points.  First, a suggestion on this floor by  any Member that because some of us  value life for purely political motiva tion, a political brochure is nonsense,  and I would ask the Member that he  should consider an apology to those of  us who consider  the  life and death  issue as extremely important.  Second, those that advocate the in fringement on moral rights argument  should consider tragic actions in many  hospitals across this country. On one  floor there are hundreds of thousands  of dollars of new technological equip ment used to save the life of a prema turely born baby because the mother  values life and our laws allow her to do  so. On a floor above or below, less so phisticated equipment is being used to  wipe out and abort the same age fetus,  because of her value of life and our  laws allow her to do so. Both fetus of  the same stage of development are  alive, breathing, heart beating, and  brain activity flourishing.  One mother feels the fetus is dead;  and the other feels the baby is alive  and worth saving. In our schizophren ic society we cannot seem to adequate ly define the value and morality of life  and death. My dear colleagues,  the  morality issue is one that needs atten tion and clarity. Our society will not  accept the double standard of life.  Third,  regarding  some  suggesting  this amendment is unconstitutional, I  would  like  to remind my colleagues  that the U.S. Supreme Court has given  us the authority to limit Federal tax  dollars funding abortion. So to suggest  opposition on the basis of a constitu tionality question  is not founded.  I  urge adoption of the amendment.  Mr. McEWEN. Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1464,1147,18,Mr. SILJANDER.," I yield to the gen tleman from Ohio.  Mr. McEWEN. I  man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to point  out the fact that we have had people  who will support legislation to tell you  how fast to drive your car, what you  are going to have on the exhaust pipe,  seat belts, mileage and all the rest, and  yet when it comes to what the Govern ment should do  they change  their  tune. The Declaration of  Independ ence says that for this cause, govern ments are instituted among men; for  the preservation of life,  liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. It is interest ing to note that the very purpose for  which government is established, the  preservation of life, these liberals now  claim the Government should not be  involved.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from Cali fornia <Mr. FAZIO).  ",1983
1465,1147,18,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Chairman, I would  appreciate it very much if the Mem bers who have not voted on an issue as  basic as a complete limitation on abor tion-no abortion even to save the life  of a mother would simply focus on one  very important point when they cast  their vote. That point  is  that we  cannot have some people voting on  this floor one way to satisfy a political  need when they know in their hearts  that they would do something differ ent personally  under  circumstances  that we all would abhor, for example,  the rape and pregnancy of one of our  children.  thank the gentle I know there are some Members who  have voted to limit the public use of  funds for abortion who know  them selves that they would resort to abor tion within their family if it were re quired.  It is fundamental, I believe, for us to  vote what our true personal views are  on this matter. We know that in our  districts 75 percent of our constituents  oppose a similar complete ban on abor tion through the constitutional proc ess, and yet we come here for political  purposes  and  focus  on only  those  narrow groups of people who are con tained within our appropriations proc ess, within the Federal budget bill.  If we, ourselves and our constitu ents, do not believe that we should  completely limit abortion, how can we  deprive poor people and Federal em ployees and others who simply come  under our budget purview of their con stitutional rights. We must have equal  protection under the law. I urge a no  vote on the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  gentleman from Oregon <Mr. AuCoIN)  has 2 minutes remaining.  ",1983
1466,1147,18,Mr. AUCOIN.," Mr. Chairman, how  much time does the other side have re maining?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  Chair would  advise  the gentleman  that all time has expired on the other  side.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali fornia (Mr. WAXMAN).  ",1983
1467,1147,18,Mr. WAXMAN.," I thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, we find ourselves in a  very peculiar situation. The rules pro vide that the usual Hyde amendment  is out of order as a legislation on this  appropriation bill. There are  indeed  important legislative issues to decide.  Should we  restrict  abortions when  pregnancy results from incest or rape?  Should we have abortions restricted at  all?  I want to emphasize that what we  have before us right now is a different  amendment than we usually have each  year. We are not going to permit an  abortion even  to save  the  life of a  mother. If we vote for  this amend ment, we are saying the life of the  fetus is worth more than the life of  the mother.  That  is  a very different question  than we have voted on in the past.  That illustrates to me why this should  not be in an appropriations bill at all.  It ought to be on the agenda of the  Policy Committee.  This Congress never even had hear ings on the abortion question in any  committee until this year, when our  committee  held  a  hearing  on  the  whole question of unintended preg nancies and their consequences.  I   ",1983
1468,1186,18,Mr. TAUKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, and Members of the  House,  I wish  to  congratulate  the  members of the Rules Committee and,  more specifically, the members of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs and the  Committee on Energy and Commerce,  who have worked so diligently to de velop comprehensive legislation which  meets the needs of radio broadcasting  to Cuba yet, at the same time, protects  broadcasters in our own country.  By accepting the legislation that has  already been passed by the Senate, I  believe we can dispose of what has  been a very controversial issue while  at the same time insuring that virtual ly all Members of the House will be  able to support the bill.  I think all of us want to be united in  the foreign policy initiatives which are  involved. Yet, at the same  time, we  wish to insure protection for those in  our own country who have legitimate  broadcasting interests.  So, Mr. Speaker, I support the rule  and I hope  that my colleagues will  support the  legislation as it will be  presented next week.  ",1983
1469,1186,18,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such  time as he may consume,  for  debate purposes, to the distinguished  gentleman  from  Colorado  <Mr.  WIRTH).  ",1983
1470,1186,18,Mr. WIRTH.," I thank the chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of  this rule. I want to commend the gen tleman from Florida <Mr. PEPPER) and  the members of the Rules Committee  for their persistence in this, in bring ing  together  some  very  divergent  points of view, which were reflected  accurately by Mr. TAYLOR  in his re marks earlier  in which  there have  been  very  deep  divisions  between  members of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce and members of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Mr. FASCELL and I have talked about  this for a long time and have come, I  think, to agreement on this through  the offices of  the chairman of  the  Committee on Rules, ",1983
1471,1186,18,Mr. PEPPER.,"  So in supporting this rule I want to  again, Mr. Chairman, thank you very  much for your efforts in putting this  together. The gentlemen Mr. PEPPER  and Mr. FASCELL are very strong and I  must say combative advocates for an  issue which initially Mr. TAUKE and I  might have disagreed with you. But I  think we have come to a very reasona ble solution to the problem.  I thank the gentleman from Florida  very much and for his, as usual, gen tlemanly  but  highly  effective  ap proach to this issue.  Throughout the debate on the issue  of broadcasting to Cuba, the concerns  of the Energy and Commerce Commit tee have been:  The allocation of a frequency that  will have the least negative impact on  American broadcasters;  The  impact  on American  radio  broadcasters and  the radio  listening  public that might stem from Cuban re taliatory countermeasures.  During our consideration of H.R.  2453, authored by Mr. FASCELL,  the  Energy  and  Commerce  Committee  adopted  several  amendments which  were aimed at making sure that the  frequency on which Radio Marti operated would result in the least amount  of Cuban  interference for American  broadcasters and be least disruptive to  the listening public.  The delicately balanced compromise  reached in the Senate legislation will  assure that radio broadcasting to Cuba  operates as an entity within the Voice  of America. One of the amendments  adopted by the Energy and Commerce  Committee, offered by Mr. TAUKE, also  would have permitted Radio Marti to  operate as a part of the VOA or on a  shortwave frequency. The compromise  is  consistent with  the Energy  and  Commerce Committee's overall  ap proach to the frequency that should  be authorized for Radio Marti. By in suring that the Broadcasting to Cuba  service would be a VOA station, oper ating under the VOA charter, and on a  VOA frequency, this approach should  greatly minimize  the  potential  for  harmful Cuban retaliation that could  be devastating to the American radio  broadcasting industry.  It is my feeling, Mr. Speaker, that  the frequency allocation and interf er ence issues are satisfactorily handled  by the compromise bill. The compro mise does address the issues that fall  under the purview of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, I am pleased to  lend my support to those particular  sections of the legislation.  An issue that the Energy and Com merce Committee was also extremely  concerned about is insuring that the  Federal  Communications  Commis sion-the expert agency-be the entity  to make determinations relative to fre quency use and  to broadcaster com pensation for damage suffered due to  Cuban  retaliation. The  compromise  recognizes that the FCC, as an inde pendent agency, divorced from the ad ministration's foreign policy appara tus, is the most appropriate agency to  deal with these issues.

1476,1277,18,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker,  this  past weekend,  Rabbi  Jeffrey  Salk.in of Temple Judea  in Doyles town, Pa., discussed with his congrega tion at Yom Kippur services the plight  of Soviet Jewry in very vivid  terms.  Rabbi Salkin's message serves as a re minder to us that we must continue to  do all we can  to help Soviet Jews  pursue their dream of religious free dom.  The text follows:  ENCOUNTERS WITH THE JEWS OF SILENCE  <Sermon delivered by Rabbi Jeffrey K.  Salkin)  Why did  I choose  to go  to  the Soviet  Union this past June? What draws an Amer ican Jew and a rabbi to Russia?  I believe that I went to the Soviet Union  as a partial atonement for the sin of having  heard the cries of my brothers and sisters,  but having done little to respond to their  cries. I had been burnt-out on the topic of  Soviet Jewry. Indeed, I had signed the peti tions and attended the rallies and the pa rades that plead for the release of our fet tered people who  languish  in  the prison  that is the Soviet Union. But that was all.  For me, it remained a distant concern-one  more episode of persecution to fit into the  web of Jewish history.  Until this trip to the Soviet Union, I was a  vicarious spectator to their turmoil. Truly,  there is nothing like real experience to help  us understand the situation as it exists, to  help us visualize what Russian  Jews go  through every day of their lives.  That is why I went into the trenches of  Jewish identity. For that is what the Soviet  Union is. It is the home of what may be the  bravest Jews in the world. It is where the  spiritual blood of Jewry is both shed-and  replenished all the time.  And it is only there that one can learn the  true depth of the situation. Since my return  I have been asked by many people: ""Is it  really as bad as  they say it is for Soviet  Jews?"" The question is well-meaning. It is  being asked by Jews who are probably as  bored as I used to be of the whole issue.  I must tell you that the answer to that  question is: Yes. Yes, the situation is as bad  as they say. It is worse than they say. And  there was not a single Jew with whom I  spoke-and we met with perhaps thirty re fuseniks  in a variety of settings-who did  not emphasize their dark fear that the situ ation is going to continue getting more de sparate. For these Jews who so desperately  want to leave the Soviet Union, the term  ""Iron Curtain"" is too benign. The Curtain  has bars. The gates are virtually shut tight.  In recent weeks, the world has been given  a new and bloodly lesson on the Russian na tional character. The impunity, arrogance,  and cynical disregard  for humanity with  which they shot down Flight 007 is reflected  in every aspect of the Soviet system. And I  say this not as a screaming right-winger, but  as a man with almost impeccable liberal cre dentials and concern for human rights.  From  the moment  that one enters  the  Soviet Union,  it is abundantly clear that  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  this is a nation whose principle industry is  the repression of the human spirit. In the  words of our prayerbook, it is ""the kingdom  of  arrogance.""  It is Egypt and Amalek  wrapped into one.  It is written in the faces of the customs of ficials, most of them still in their teens, who  eye each person as they enter the Soviet  state. They stare at you, then at your pass port picture, then at the picture on your  visa, then back at you. In their eyes is writ ten large the traditional Russian response  to the world, a response as old as the first  Czars: a pathological hatred and fear of for eigners.  It is written  in  the  inability  to speak  openly about one's religion, or  life-work,  about  the synagogue, about Israel, about  any of the institutions that give us joy and  strength. Every Jewish reference must be  spoken about through the veil of euphe mism. The hotel  rooms are bugged. The  telephones are bugged. One must be careful  of who may be listening on the street. In  every home, a child's Magic Slate plays a  central role  in basic communication. Any  notes that are taken on what one sees must  be coded and then flushed down the toilet,  wrapped in absorbent American toilet paper  that has been brought  from  the United  States for just that purpose.  It is written in the eyes of the people on  the street, the people who ride the excellent  subways of Moscow and Leningrad-perhaps  the most  efficient  and most  aesthetic  system in the world. The eyes betray no joy.  They rather betray a blandness of exist ence-one Inight even say a boredom with  the world. The only sparkling smiles are in  the omnipresent posters  that paper  the  buildings of the cities,  those posters that  trumpet the traditional values of Soviet so ciety. But those values are only found  in  posters. The Russian people have grown  cynical of the dream. They covet the accou trements of the West. They want to buy my  jeans right off my body. Lenin's image is ev erywhere, but one senses that for most Rus sians, it is an empty presence.  And the Jews? What can we say about  this, the third largest Jewish community in  the world?  To look in their eyes is to see fatigue, but  despair has not snuffed out all the sparks of  hope. It has not negated the phenomenal  strength and determination of this people and their accomplishments.  Those accomplishments exist, despite the  fact that even the most basic piece of Ju daica-the child's coloring book, anything  with a Jewish symbol on it-can be an item  frought with danger. For Judaica is basical ly illegal in the Soviet Union. The most in nocuous printed matter is a ""criminal text.""  We were  told that the Leningrad  library  alone contains hundreds of  thousands of  Jewish texts. But Jews are denied access to  them. They are considered Zionist propa ganda. The only people who are allowed to  read them are the agents of the State.  Let me speak of the faith of the Russian  Jews-a faith that persists in the face of the  most overwhelming odds in the world today.  Their faith begins with the state of Israel.  For obvious reasons, it is an absolute obses sion. To meet the Russian Jews is to truly  understand Zionism  for  the  first  time.  Theirs  is a pure Zionism, one that Herzl  would have understood.  We met with Nelly of Leningrad. She is a  young grandmother who has never seen her  grandson, because he lives in Israel. She has  an aged father who lives in the Negev, and  she despairs over whether she will ever see  25543  him again. We asked her what her original  reason for going to Israel was. She told us:  ""We have a home now. Why should we live  among strangers?""  The love of the land is part of the lives of  the children, even when they are too young  to understand it. We visited with the family  of Boris E. and we took great delight in his  three year old son Eliahu. Boris's living  room is typically decorated with momentos  and pictures and maps of Israel. He tells his  son, ""Go find Jerusalem,"" and  the child  makes a beeline for the map and points to  the exact place of  the Holy City. They  flipped through the pages of a book, and  the child was able to point out the pictures  of Begin and Sharon.  We might call such things indoctrination,  perhaps even brainwashing, but it demon strates beyond a doubt that the truly suc cessful Jewish education begins in, and  is  nourished, by the home.  You must experience their love of the lan guage. It is uncanny. If ever a  language  could be idolized,  that is what they have  done with Hebrew.  Nellie told us the story of a woman named  Leah. Thirty  years  ago,  no  one  knew  Hebrew in the Soviet Union. Leah was sick  in bed, and with nothing else to do, listened  to the Hebrew broadcasts on the short-wave  radio. From this she learned Hebrew, and  ultimately, taught every one else. She was  imprisoned for her pedagogy, and when to gether we visited the old Jewish cemetery in  Leningrad, Nellie took us to visit her grave,  which is adorned with her striking photo graph.  The care,  love, and creativity that goes  into both  the  teaching and  learning of  Hebrew is astronomical, and mastering the  language is the goal of every refusenik that  we met. And they do this without formally  trained or professionally paid teachers. If  ever a sense of hevra, sacred community ex isted anywhere, it exists among the Russian  Jews, who learn from each other and with  each other.  There was the night that we studied with  the teachers circle in Leningrad-a group of  highly intelligent people in their twenties  and  thirties, most of  them ex-computer  technicians  and  scientists who  are  now  forced to work as janitors and street clean ers, I was seized by the fact that we were  studying  in secret. The Leningrad group  had been accused by  the authorities of  being a front for the Shin Bet, the Israeli  secret service. I  thought to myself, ""How  many generations of Jews have had to study  in secret? The Jews of the Roman oppres sion-the Marranos-the  Jews  of  the  Warsaw Ghetto-and now us. Our ancestors  sat and studied with us, as willing partici pants.  That night, we embraced our new friends.  With tears in our eyes, we vowed never to  forget them, never to forget their struggle,  never  to forget  these, some of  the most  heroic Jews in the world.e  INSIDE AFGHANISTAN: WAR OF  INNOCENTS  HON.

1484,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  the  amendment I am offering seeks to cor rect a situation not provided for in the  Budget Act of 1973.  As my colleagues know, the Budget  Act  of  1973  provides mechanisms  whereby  the executive branch must  submit to Congress either deferrals or  rescissions when it finds  that funds  appropriated by Congress will not be  utilized  as Congress  intended. The  motive behind this particular aspect of  the Budget Act were actions carried  out by a number of administrations  who simply impounded funds despite  congressional action.  Unfortunately. in the case of direct  loan authority and loan guarantee au thority of the Export-Import Bank,  such  impoundment  is  still possible.  Indeed, despite the fact that Congress  provided $4.4 billion in direct loans for  the current fiscal year, the administra tion in its budget submission last Feb ruary said that it would only allocate  $3,830,000,000, which had been their  original budget request. Unbelievable  as  it may seem,  the Export-Import  Bank tried to tell us that they had  made a new evaluation and it was just  coincidental that their new assessment  came to the same figure as their origi nal budget request. In my mind that  shows at least a disregard of congres sional concerns, if not outright con tempt for Congress and the legislative  branch. The amendment I am offering  today would  require  the Bank  to  secure specific legislation from Con gress reducing congressionally provid ed authority if they find the amount  we have provided is in excess of their  needs.  Mr. President, I believe this amend ment is good government, an exten sion of what Congress has been trying  to  do  over  the  last  several  years  through  the overall budget process,  and furthermore, especially with re spect  to  the Export-Import Bank  where Congress and the administra tion have had so many differences, I  this extra oversight  think we need  mechanism.  I hope the distinguished managers  of the bill will see fit to accept the  amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to add Senator LEvIN as a cospon sor of my amendment.  ",1983

1489,1303,18,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, speaking  on behalf of the majority, I am pre pared  to  accept  this  amendment.  Indeed, I strongly endorse it.  What we are really talking about is  treating Eximbank with respect to any  excess direct loan or loan guarantee  authority just the way we treat any  other branch or agency of the Federal  Government.  At the present time it is treated dif ferently. It is not subject to the rescis sion authority that all other agencies  must operate under.  That has often operated, in my judg ment, to the detriment of the United  States and our export competitiveness.  I salute the Senator from Wisconsin  for offering this amendment. It is a  very useful amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.  ",1983
1490,1303,18,Mr. PROXMIRE., This amendment  is offered by my distinguished col league from Wisconsin?  ,1983
1491,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," It is.  PROXMIRE.  I  hesitate  to  oppose anything my friend from Wis consin offers. We work  together  in  behalf of my State. We have always  been in complete harmony.  But I understand this amendment is  opposed by  the administration, op posed by the Office of Management  and Budget.  It would require the agency to go  ahead and expend  the money even  though they do not have to and do not  need it.  It seems to me to be a bad course to  follow for any agency, and we all know  that the Export-Import Bank  is  re vered, worshiped, and adored regular ly, not just on Sundays, but 7 days a  week. But it seems to me this is really  overdoing it.  So, I must say I have considerable  problems with this amendment, espe cially since I say it is opposed by the  Export-Import Ba.ilk and opposed by  the  Office  of Management  and  Budget, which I suppose does speak  for the administration. At a time when  we have colossal deficits  for us  to  insist that an agency go ahead and  expend  their guarantee or  expend  their funds seems to me is wrong.  Mr.  ",1983
1492,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  ",1983
1493,1303,18,Mr. PROXMIRE., I yield.  ,1983
1494,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I wish  to make one point. We are not insist ing that they spend the money or they  do not spend the money. What we are  doing is establishing for the Eximbank  the exact same mechanism which is  now in place for most other agencies.  If they  choose not  to  spend  the  money, they come back to us to get  our approval. All we are trying to do is  continue  to have  the congressional  process work so that they cannot uni laterally, if you will, make a decision  on spending. If they choose  to not  spend the money, they come back to  us and there is the same kind of proc ess that is in existence for most other  agencies. I just want to put the Exim bank under that same process of con tinuing  to work with  the legislative  branch, not being able to unilaterally  make a rescission or an impoundment.  ",1983
1495,1303,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Is it not true that  if Congress does not act within 45  days, they then have to go ahead and  spend the funds?  ",1983
1496,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN., That is the system we  have  in place  for  all Government  agencies. It is the same system. It is  the Budget Act of  1973. And  the  system is in place for everything. It is  not in place for the Eximbank. I just  want to bring the Eximbank into the  same system.  Mr. PROXMIRE_;. What happens if  there  are  not  qualified  applicants  available?  ,1983
1497,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," That  is  fine. They  would come to us and say, ""We do not  find qualified applicants, we want to  spend less money.""  ",1983
1498,1303,18,Mr. PROXMIRE., Suppose Congress  does not act in the 45 days.  ,1983
1499,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," There is an expedited  procedure for Congress. It is the same  as if the Department of the Interior or  any other Government agency. They  are all under this now and there are  decisions that are made in which they  do not sl)end the money and we,  in  fact, can work with that.  The Budget Act does not right now  include the Eximbank. I am trying to  bring them into a similar process so  they are treated exactly like all other  agencies.  ",1983
1500,1303,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," This is to apply to  loan guarantees, and the Budget Act  does not apply to loan guarantees.  ",1983
1501,1303,18,Mr. KASTEN.," I do not know why  the Budget Act did not include the Ex imbank in the beginning. Maybe it was  because of loan guarantees, maybe it  was not. I am simply saying that the  same process which is in place for all  other agencies should include the Ex imbank. There is no reason that they  should make decisions on their own,  whereas in all the other agencies, in  all the other spending decisions, they  cannot.  ",1983
1502,1316,18,Mr. HEINZ.," The Senator from New  Mexico has expressed concerns that  are very much shared by this Senator.  The same situation exists with steel.  The Export-Import Bank has made  loans in Argentina of $18, 785,000 for  equipment and  services  for  a  steel  plant; a loan in Taiwan of $19,500,000  for a steel expansion project; and in  Mexico a loan of $151,393,000 for the  expansion of a steel plant. These are  just a few isolated examples, there are  many others.  Mr. DOMENIC!. I travel a lot in my  State, and constituents ask me why we  have entities like the Eximbank and  the World Bank that make loans to in crease world capacity for commodities  that are already in surplus. They see it  simply as the Government using their  tax dollars to put them out of work.  Early in this Congress, I introduced  S. 852, a bill that would prohibit the  Eximbank from financing building or  expanding the capacity  in a  foreign  country to produce surplus commod ities. Also prohibited are  loans  for  commodities likely to be in surplus if  the resulting productive capacity will  As  cause substantial injury to U.S. pro ducers of the same, similar or compet ing commodities. Before I would advo cate such a stance I would want full  hearings which, to date, have not been  held.  Notwithstanding that fact,  I  think  that it is  inexcusable that Congress  allows  the Eximbank to make  loans  without requiring an economic impact  study. The essential usefulness of an  economic  impact study  is not new.  Back home  in New Mexico when a  banker considers a loan application he  looks at the industry and asks if there  is a need for the proposed project. If  there is no need, the banker, as a citi zen can better serve the community by  making the loan to another appli'(ant.  Market demand is also a predictor of  success and the related prospect of re payment.  a  . businessman,  the  banker better serves his stockholders  by avoiding loans for surplus commod ity production.  The Eximbank already has proce dures to evaluate any adverse domestic  impact of  its activities. The bank's  guidelines take into account the intent  behind the stimulus of the project to  determine whether  it  is  consistent  with U.S. macroeconomic and philo sophic objectives. The guidelines also  require that the bank look at the net  economic impact and quantify both in  dollars and  jobs  the  impact of  the  transaction on the domestic economy  and the degree to which U.S. industry  will be affected.  This  procedure  sounds  good  on  paper. However, the problem over at  the Eximbank  is  that  they do not  always do the economic impact stud ies. They did not do such a study on  the Cananea project.  I thought about offering an amend ment that would require the bank to  do a full economic impact study pursu ant to its guidelines on every project.  Officials from the Eximbank say that  they do not have the time or resources  to do a full study for each project that  they finance.  Another alternative would be to re quire an economic  impact study for  projects  that have, or are  likely  to  have, surplus capacity at the time the  project becomes operational.  The problem is a very real one that  has spread from various commodities  and manufactured products  to  the  point where it probably affects every  State's economy. I think that a work able method of dealing with this situa tion must be found. Because of the un answered questions I am not going to  off er any of the possible amendments  I have discussed today. My purpose in  laying them out is to suggest possible  alternatives that could be  looked at  when  the Banking Committee  has  hearings, which I hope the chairman  will agree to hold.  Instead of offering an amendment, I  would like Congress to reaffirm a re1978  porting  requirement  that Congress  created in 1978 when we amended the  Export-Import Bank Act, we required  the International Trade Commission  to  prepare  a  report  assessing  the  impact of the Bank's activities on in dustries  and  employment  in  the  United States. That report has never  been issued. It appears to this Senator  that congressional oversight of  this  problem is an essential starting point  to determine to what extent economic  impact studies should be required. I  would suggest that the ITC complete  the  report mandated  in  the  amendments.  In  addition,  it  is my  hope  that  the Banking Committee  would hold hearings this year on this  very question.  ",1983
1503,1316,18,Mr. HEINZ.," I agree that oversight is  necessary and commit to the Senator  from New Mexico that such hearings  will be held this fall. We might also  explore  the  possibility  of  hearings  before the International Trade Sub committee of the Finance Committee,  a subcommittee on which I serve, al though, as the Senator knows,  that  would be up to Senator DANFORTH, the  chairman of the subcommittee. In ad dition, I am prepared to work with the  Senator from New Mexico  to  insure  that the ITC completes the study you  mentioned and that it include in that  study an analysis of commodities  in  surplus on world markets or  those  that have excess manufacturing capac ity, and the possible adverse affect on  U.S. products of Eximbank financing  of projects that contribute to such sur plus or excess capacity.  I appreciate the Senator's interest in  this problem and that he has raised it  as an issue as we consider this legisla tion.  Mr. President, it is my understand ing that discussions have been going  on with  respect  to  the Danforth  amendment, and  I  am prepared  to  yield the floor.

Senators should not be under the im pression  that we  can wait  until  Monday, because there is not going to  be a Monday. We are going to be on  the war powers resolution on Monday,  Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday.  I want to try to finish this bill today  if possible.

",1983
1520,1368,18,Mr.  UNDER SECRETARY FOR  AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS  HEFLIN.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly recommend to my colleagues  the creation of a new position within  the Department of State to be entitled  the Under Secretary for Agricultural  Affairs.  We need to be sure that there is at  least one high level State Department  official who is an expert on the rela tionship between agricultural and for eign policy since, increasingly, our ag ricultural policy is being set by offi cials in the State Department. For ex ample:  In the past decade there have been  four embargoes of agricultural goods,  and in the wake of the Korean airliner  incident, calls for yet another grain  sanction against the Soviets. It is clear  that the only party injured by such  embargoes is the United States since  the Soviets have plenty of other sup pliers to choose from. Moreover, the  embargoes  have  critically  harmed  America's reputation as a reliable sup plier and reduced prospects for future  sales.  Agricultural products account for 20  percent of all U.S. exports and contrib ute $26 billion to the balance of trade.  Agricultural exports account for $95  billion of our domestic economic activ ity and provide 1.2 million jobs. Each  extra $1 billion in exports creates as  many as 35,000 new jobs.  State Department employees are sta tioned in nearly every nation around  the globe and are in an excellent posi tion  to monitor economic conditions  and promote  trade. Aggressive U.S.  export policies will  expand  trading  partnerships, especially in the devel oping nations, and where  trade  in creases, so does U.S. influence.  Agricultural  issues have become a  sticking point with several of our tra ditional  allies,  and Foreign Service  personnel are  in a position  to help  reduce trade barriers and resolve agri cultural subsidy disputes.  Other agriculture-related issues that  must be dealt with by our  foreign  policy establishment, on a bilateral or  multilateral basis, include Commodity  Credit Corporation guarantees to the  Eastern bloc, matters relating to the  Caribbean Basin Initiative, Food For  Peace, agricultural exchange programs  and general economic trends.  Today  the American  farmer  has  little or no access to the makers of our  foreign policy. We need to provide a  permanent, specialized conduit for the  concerns of the farmer, who has borne  the brunt of many of our  foreign  policy decisions.  ",1983
1521,1407,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker, in a  period when the importance of agri cultural exports continue  to assume  tremendous importance to the Ameri can agricultural producer and virtually  all segments of the American econo my,  the role of private agricultural  consultants in expanding foreign com modity sales ls often overlooked.  In recognition of the contributions  made by members of the American So ciety of Agricultural Consultants,  I  submit for my colleagues' perusal the  following  article  from  that group's  May 1983 newsletter:  OVERSEAS AG CONSULTING GROWS DESPITE  WEAK WORLD EcoNOllY  The leadership role of U.S. agricultural  consultants in developing food production  and distribution systems  throughout  the  world has come into sharp focus in a survey  recently conducted by the American Society  of .Agricultural Consultants <ASAC>. Society  members reported consulting assignments in  forty-five countries around -the world. cover ing 115 different development projects. U.S.  exports could increase by as much as $420  million in goods and services necessary to  support the projects underway with U.S.  private agricultural consulting assistance.  The abillty of U.S. agricultural consult ants to successfully translate management  and technology into efficient food supply  systems was an  important  factor  in  the  strong demand for their services, despite the  continuing weakness of the world economy  and intense competition from other nations'  service  industries. Six  times as many  re spondents to the ASAC survey reported in creases  in overseas business  in  the past  twelve months as reported decreases.  Although  substantial gains were  regis tered in foreign consulting assignments by  the U.S. industry, ASAC members reported  several obstacles  to  further  increases  in  overseas ""Projects. A number of potential  U.S. consulting assignments were  lost  to  government-backed competition from mem bers of the European Community and east ern bloc nations. EC and eastern bloc na tions provide a variety of government assist ance in the form of subsidies or low cost fi nancing to service industries conpeting for  foreign business. A number of U.S. govern ment agencies and the Congress have re cently begun to investigate the effect on the  U.S. economy of service business lost to U.S.  firms by subsidized foreign competition.  25673  The potential value of exports resulting  from U.S.  consulting assignments abroad  rose by $1.6 million per consultant between  1982  and  1983  according  to  the ASAC  survey. Each U.S. consultant was involved in  development projects having an average  annual potential of $10.2 million dollars in  U.S. exports. This includes the actual busi ness services provided, and the value of the  construction,  maintenance  and  supply  equipment, as well as  the breeding stock  feed grains and other agricultural products  needed to successfully operate modem food  and fiber systems, which could be provided  by other U.S. firms. The multiplier effect of  agricultural consulting is often many times  the value of the basic services provided, as  foreign buyers generally tum to the country  which conducted the feasibillty studies for  assistance with the construction, and main tenance of the project.  The 1983 ASAC survey also indicates the  growing private sector role of foreign and  U.S. agribusiness in world food development  as government budgets are strained and na tionally-financed projects are delayed or  cancelled. In the past year, 60 percent of  the consulting assignments reported were  sponsored by private firms-39 percent by  foreign businesses, and 21 percent by Ameri can firms. Reported U.S. government spon sorship of foreign assignments using private  U.S. agricultural consultants rose to 12 per cent of the total while foreign government  sponsorship was 28 percent according to the  survey.  Africa continues to be the leading market  for U.S. agricultural consultants according  to the survey, followed by Asia and the Far  East, Europe, other North American coun tries, the Middle East, Latin America, the  Caribbean and the South Pacific.  In addition to subsidized foreign competi tion,  agricultural consultants often cited  weak world economic conditions-as a major  factor  in keeping business  faster. Many noted that currency devaluations around the world had affected their  business, while others  indicated  that de creasing  foreign government development  budgets and lack of financing proved to be  obstacles. However, many consultants told  ASAC that the demand for agricultural de velopment services remains strong. Declin ing oil prices and continuing need for for eign nations to learn how to tum U.S. agri cultural  technology  into bottom  line per formance were often cited .as signs of future  increases '111 U.S.  agricultural consulting  overseas.   from growing  NATURAL GAS PRICF.S: UP OR  DOWN?

1523,50,22,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I rise  to  commend Capt. Grace Murray  Hopper, who has been recommended  by the Committee on Armed Services  for promotion to flag  rank. Captain  Hopper is exceptionally well qualified  and eminently deserving of promotion  to flag rank.  She is acknowledged to be one of the  founders of the computer science pro fession. She has received 10 honorary  doctor's degrees, the Man of the Year  award from the Data Processing Man agement Association, and has had an  award  for Outstanding Young Com puter Professionals  set  up  in  her  honor by the Sperry Corp.  Her career  in  the Naval Reserve  began in 1943 and she was commis sioned as lieutenant (j.g.) in 1944. Her  initial  assignment  was  with  the  Bureau of Ordinance's computation  project at Harvard, where she pro gramed  the  first  large  scale digital  computer. She has continued to make  outstanding contributions to the Navy  in the field of data processing and has  been awarded both  the meritorious  service medal and the Legion of Merit.  Currently, Captain Hopper is serving  on active duty as the special adviser to  the commander of the Naval Data Au tomation Command.  Her promotion to commodore is well  deserved and  I wholeheartedly  sup port it.  CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE  BANKERS' WEEK  e ",1983
1524,50,22,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, I ask  that a proclamation to be read by the  Governor of California, George Deuk mejian, for California Mortgage Bank ers' Week, November 6-12, 1983, be in serted in the RECORD as a  tribute to  ",1983
1525,63,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Certainly.  Mr. McCLURE. A number of people,  in looking at the timetable for the leg islation  before  us,  say  you  simply  cannot deal with that question in the  time we have. But I think we have to  try. I will not be satisfied unless we try  to bring relief to the consumers of this  country. I think it would be a terrible  indictment of  this body  if, without  having tried at all, we were to adjourn  and go home, and then say to those  people as  their bills come  in during  December and January, ""Well, we are  on recess, we didn't even try to help  you.""  Now, it may be that we cannot suc ceed, but I think we have to try.  ",1983
1526,63,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," I think the Sena tor is correct. That is why I say let us  make progress toward that by dealing  with  the  Kassebaum  amendment.  Now,  if in fact the Senate is serious,  and I believe the majority leader is se rious, about going out on November  18-I spoke  to him  as  recently  as  lunchtime today, and he advised that  not only is he serious but that he gets  calls from Speaker O'NEILL from time  to time just to keep up his enthusiasm,  as he said-if there is a view to get out  November  18  or  anywhere  around  that,  it  is going  to be uncommonly  hard to finally dispose of this bill. And  I would say it would be impossible if  the Senator from Montana wished to  keep  the matter going during  that  time. In fact, if any Senator is deter mined not to have it voted on for final  passage before November 18, I believe  he can be successful in so doing.  So  I  think  it would be something  within the control of the Senator from  Montana. He need not worry that we  would  deal  with  the  Kassebaum  amendment,  that  it would  fail, and  that he would then be faced with an  immediate vote on some compromise  that he did not have sufficient time to  amend or study or debate. That simply  will not happen. But I do  think we  make progress if we can put down the  Kassebaum amendment under what ever  reasonable  time agreement  the  Senator from Montana would  think  would be proper-10 hours, 5 hours a  side, whatever he would wish-and  then at least we will have made that  much progress. I agree with the Sena tor from Idaho that we must do our  best to bring relief to the consumer  for this winter. If we try and do not  succeed, well, we have done our best  but  at  least we  can make  that  progress.  the Senator  ",1983
1527,63,22,Mr. MELCHER., Will  yield?  ,1983
1528,63,22,Mr. JOHNSTON., Certainly.  ,1983
1529,63,22,Mr. MELCHER.," I have no doubt in  the sincerity of the Senator from Lou isiana and the Senator from Idaho as  managers of the bill that they would  like  to make  some progress, but  I  again point out that while we under stand what  is  in  the Kassebaum  amendment, since that was the subject  the Senator from Louisiana was dis cussing, we would not  know what  might be the feeling of a lot of Sena tors on what, with the modifications  of the Kassebaum amendment or some  other substitute, might be advanta geous in securing a majority vote.  Now, since this is a complex matter  and since the vehicle before us under  consideration is the motion to proceed  to S. 1715, which is adequate to attract  a majority of votes,  it seems  to me  that we should be privy to all of the  proposals that are now being made for  a package that is sought. It is a com plex matter, I  repeat, and before we  arrive at that point of having a majori ty willing  to support one version or  the other, I think we ought to be able  to review what is in the mill right now,  and I do not think we have been able  to do that. At least I have not been  able to do that.  I think there has been some progress  made, quiet progress, to put together a  package  that will attract a broader  number of votes than either S. 1715 or  the Kassebaum amendment that has  been considered in the committee. But  I am also of the opinion that perhaps  we are already beyond that as far as  some Senators are concerned and are  now  reviewing  a  package  they  feel  might mean 50-some votes or maybe  even 60. At that point, we are going to  also be faced with the question should  we proceed. I think we make time by  reviewing what might be  that final  package prior to that point. I do not  have any feeling that this matter will  be cleared up by November 18 either,  as the Senator from Louisiana has just  stated. I do not think it will be cleared  up by  that  time. But whatever  the  plan is  in calling up this bill now, I  would  like  to know  the full plan.  I  would like to see the rationale for even  bringing  it up, because we  are not  really doing very much if we get into a  stage where we  have  looked  at  a  couple of amendments and we go out  over the Thanksgiving and Christmas  and New Year period, not  to come  back until perhaps the third week in  January. We have not resolved much  of anything, and I do not see how that  helps speed up  the activities of  the  Senate.  We were told last night by the ma jority leader that he thought he would  perhaps ask that this motion be laid  aside so that the necessary appropria tion bill for Treasury could be brought  up or  the Intelligence authorization  assumed  the  GRASSLEY  bill. We are not doing that. But we are  discussing what is wrong with S. 1715,  and at least that is a starting point. I  think we ought to continue that dis cussion until we see some further light  on what could resolve  the  ills of S.  1715.  <Mr.  chair.)  ",1983
1530,63,22,Mr.  JOHNSTON.,"  Is  the Senator  saying that an attempt to negotiate a  time  agreement  built  around  the  Kassebaum  amendment,  that  is,  S.  996, and I am thinking of a time agree ment which would  involve  the non amendability of  that amendment so  you vote on that amendment up and  down, would not be a constructive ex ercise?  ",1983
1531,63,22,Mr. MELCHER.,"  I do not think it  would be constructive at this time. In  the normal course of events and the  rules of the Senate, we would antici pate a vote on a cloture petition, filed  yesterday, tomorrow 1 hour after we  come  in. Then I  think we get some  guidance from the entire body on how  they wish  to proceed.  I might add  right there, if the cloture petition is  successful on the motion to proceed, I  would not attempt in any way to en courage delay. I think I would make a  short statement at that point if the  cloture petition  is  successful, and  I  would not be encouraging other Sena tors, though normally they could use  their right  to speak  to  the motion.  They might well do that. But I would  not want  to encourage  them  to use  their right in order to further delay  the Senate's consideration.  ",1983
1532,63,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," I ask the Senator  this: Suppose cloture is invoked-and,  of course, if it is  invoked, under the  rules, we must stay on that matter  until it is completed, and if it is laid  aside, I guess it would have to be laid  aside by unanimous consent or by a  motion  to move  to something else would the Senator feel constrained to  give consent to that?  ",1983
1533,63,22,Mr. MELCHER.," I can state very can didly  to the Senator from Louisiana  that I will not oppose  the majority  leader's request at that time. If cloture  is invoked, I would not want to be an  impediment for the majority leader to  exercise the necessary prerogatives of  the majority leader for the Senate to  function properly.  ",1983
1534,63,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," We have a dual  question: One is moving on to some thing else, such as the appropriations  bill; the other is a motion which cause  the automatic return  to  the matter  under consideration, the gas bill. If we  moved on to another matter, it would  take another motion  to proceed  to  move back to this, unless it were done  by unanimous consent.  ",1983

1542,89,22,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, it is my  understanding that the bill numbered  S. 2031 introduced by Senator MOYNI HAN needs to have a reflection of the  correct title thereon. I, therefore, ask  unanimous consent for a star print of  S. 2031 to reflect the correct title.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, we  have no objection.  ",1983
1543,89,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I sug gest the absence of a quorum.  ",1983
1544,89,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  clerk will call the roll.  The  legislative clerk proceeded  call the roll.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1983
1545,89,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  to  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  At 5:35 p.m., a message  from  the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mr. Berry, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the House has passed  ",1983
1546,115,22,Mr. KINDNESS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to ask for the assistance of  my colleagues to help the Speaker of  the House of Representatives off the  hook.  We all know, if we have been paying  attention, that the bankruptcy courts  of the United States have some defi nite problems. In a state of suspension  for many months now, with uncertain ty about how judges will be appointed,  what type of judges they will be, and  how the bankruptcy courts will pro ceed,  the House of Representatives  has not acted on the resolution of that  problem.  The other body has acted. We must  resolve this problem.  Today  I have  filed at  the Clerk's  desk Discharge Petition No. 6, which  would be effective in bringing to the  floor of the House, House Resolution  346, discharging the Rules Committee  from  further  consideration of  that  rule. That rule would make in order  the consideration of H.R. 3, the Judici ary Committee bill, H.R. 3257, the bill  that I along with others on a biparti san basis have introduced to deal with  this matter, and H.R. 1800 from the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma  <Mr.  SYNAR) which deals with the consumer  bankruptcy aspects of the bankruptcy  problems that confront us.  I ask your support for Discharge Pe tition No. 6 as quickly as possible.  0 1050  THE HYPOCRICY OF U.N.  DELEGATES  <Mr. HANSEN of Utah asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1983
1547,115,22,Mr. HANSEN of Utah.," Mr. Speaker,  remember  the  reaction of  the dele gates of the United Nations when the  Soviet Union  invaded Afghanistan,  when  the Soviets crushed  the  free  trade union Solidarity in Poland, when  they shot down the innocent Korean  airliner over the Sea of Japan?  Many delegates sat idly by and twid dled their thumbs and looked bored as  the Soviet Union used its brute force  to murder,  to  intimidate,  and  to  smother the light of freedom.  However, when the United States fi nally  showed  some  courage,  finally  had the backbone and guts to step in  to help a weak and struggling nation  avoid oppressive Marxist-Leninist tyr anny, these same U.N. delegates imme diately woke up and the walls of the  United  Nations  reverberated  with  their  speeches  of  indignation,  de nouncing the United States and her  allies who assisted in the Grenada op eration.  The scriptures tell us that righteous  people should be no respectors of per sons and should treat all people the  same way. The scriptures also have a  word for people who act as the dele gates of the United Nations acted. The  English word is ""hypocrite.""  I have been a reluctant supporter of  the United Nations  for most of my  life, but now I am beginning to wonder  why we waste our time with people  who are so blatantly dishonest.  MINIMAL  LEVEL  OF  RESPECT  FOR OUR  FELLOW MEMBERS  AND THE PRESIDENT  <Mr. WEBER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1548,115,22,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker, for our  Government to function,  it is neces sary that we as elected officials show a  certain minimal  level of  respect for  one another, and that is particularly  important when we are talking about  individuals such as the Speaker of the  House and the President of the United  States.  Now, we find ourselves in a debate  over whether or not remarks attrib uted  to  the Speaker  in yesterday's  New York Times  indeed  show  that  minimal level of respect for the Presi dent of the United States. Let us look  at the words precisely.  The Speaker  is  reported  to have  said, and I quote: ""It's sinful that this  man  is  President  of  the United  States.""  Webster's  Dictionary  defines  ""sinful"" as, ""tainted with or full of sin,  highly culpable.""  I am not going to attempt to resolve  this argument. I would just say that if  I got up in the House of Representa tives and said about one of my col leagues with whom I disagreed, that,  because he disagreed with me he was  tainted with or full of sin, my words  would be  taken down and rightfully  so. If I got up and said of one of my  Democratic  colleagues  that  it was  ""sinful"" that he had been elected in a  debate  in  the House,  that would be  viewed  as  a  serious breach of  the  comity of the House and rightfully so.  Members must ask themselves what  those words mean when they are di rected by any of our Members toward  the President of the United States.  THE BEST HOPE OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE  <Mr. HUNTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1549,115,22,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, Mr.  COELHO just talked about the Republi can conference in Baltimore, and we in  the Republican Party are very happy  to see  the head of  the Democratic  Campaign Committee  so  concerned,  because  I  think he knows  full well  what our main subject was at Balti more. The main problem we addressed  was that, although the majority of the  American people consider themselves  conservative and believe in the Repub lican philosophy of productivity and  growth and a strong national defense,  we have not yet captured control of  the House to go along with Republi can control of the executive branch  and the Senate.  What Mr. COELHO fears, Mr. Speak er, is the best hope of the American  people. And that is a Republican land slide in 1984.  NEED FOR A NATIONAL  UNIFORM DRINKING AGE OF 21  <Mr. RICHARDSON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute, and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1983
1550,115,22,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  was deeply disturbed to learn that the  Reagan administration  is opposed to  Federal legislation to establish a na tional uniform drinking age of 21.  Every  year  approximately  50,000  people are killed in traffic accidents.  More  than one-half of  those deaths  are caused by drunken drivers. A dis proportionate number of those killed  are  teenage drivers.  I  have cospon sored  legislation, H.R.  3870,  intro duced by my distinguished colleague  from New Jersey, Mr. FLORIO, which  would prohibit  the sale of alcoholic  beverages to those under 21.  Statistics  show  that  raising  the  drinking age to 21 nationwide would  prevent thousands of traffic fatalities.  The  administration  strongly  agrees  that raising  the drinking age  to 21  would save lives.  However, the administration opposes  this legislation for very weak reasons.  ",1983
1551,128,22,Mr. HIGHTOWER.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1552,128,22,Mr. PENNY., I yield to the gentle man from Texas.  ,1983
1553,128,22,Mr. HIGHTOWER.," Mr. Chairman,  let me ask the gentleman, just what  now did he say he wanted to come out  of procurement? The gentleman does  not want to affect salaries, he does not  want to affect a lot of things, but he  wants us to buy less.  We have made decisions to keep cer tain missile systems and certain other  military systems, but we are going to  buy less.  Are we going to buy less food? Are  we going to buy less ammunition? Just  what are we going to buy $3 billion  less of?  ",1983
1554,128,22,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, the 3percent  cut  is  applied  against  the  dollar figures in title IV. Title IV is an  authorization for spending on procure ment for the Navy, for the Army, for  the Air Force, and for the Marines.  It is a 3-percent cut in the dollar  figure stipulated for each and every  one of the weapons systems, the mis sile  systems,  the  ammunition  and  other  items  that are  listed  in  that  title.  ",1983
1555,128,22,Mr. HIGHTOWER.," Mr. Chairman,  may I suggest to the gentleman that I  would much rather see him cut per sonnel. I would rather not recruit, I  would rather not train, and I would  rather not put people in positions of  danger where  they are  serving  the  United States than to not give them  the weapons they need when they get  there.  ",1983
1556,128,22,Mr. PENNY.," Mr. Chairman, they are  going to get the weapons. We need not  spend  quite  so much  to  purchase  them.  All of us are familiar with the report  that came out that indicated that in 1  day alone on the last day of the fiscal  year the Department of Defense spent  over $4 billion in procurement because  had they not spent it by the end of  the fiscal year, they would not have  been allowed to make those expendi tures.  Mr. Chairman, we know that they  can achieve savings. What I am saying  is that at the outset we ought to try to  achieve a 3-percent saving in each one  of those procurement categories.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  Minnesota  <Mr.  PENNY) has expired.  ",1983
1557,128,22,Mr. AUCOIN.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent  that  the gentle man from Minnesota <Mr. PENNY) be  allowed  to proceed  for 2 additional  minutes.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Oregon?  ",1983
1558,128,22,Mr. ADDABBO.," Mr. Chairman,  object.  The  heard.  The Chair will inquire, does the gen tleman from Alabama <Mr. EDWARDS)  insist on his point of order?  ",1983
1559,128,22,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Mr.  Chairman, I withdraw my reservation  of a point of order, and I rise in oppo sition to the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from Alabama <Mr. EDWARDS) is recog nized for 5 minutes in opposition to  the amendment.  ",1983
1560,128,22,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama.," Mr.  Chairman, let me say to the Members  of the House that this sounds like a  very appealing amendment, but let me  refresh our memories as to what the  committee did. I spoke about this in  the original debate on this bill.  We have cut from the budget some  $13.9  billion. This bill provides  for  CHAIRMAN.  I  Objection  is  about 21/2  percent  real growth. The  President originally requested 10 per cent real growth. He amended that re quest later and asked for 8.3 percent  real growth. The budget  resolution  provided  for 5 percent real growth.  The authorization committee provided  for 6.2 percent real growth. We came  in at 2.5 percent real growth.  That is not the end of the story. We  came in at a negative 1 percent real  growth  in procurement. We have a  minus 1 percent real growth in pro curement. The  gentleman's amend ment would  literally have us falling  backward instead of trying to hold the  line. We cut some $8 billion out of the  President's budget  on  procurement  alone.  0 1200  This request would ask us to cut an other $2.5 billion out of procurement.  Where would the gentleman have us  cut?  We have got to provide for the pro curement  of  the  systems  for  the  troops to use. I agree with the gentle man from Texas, that you might as  well cut  the  troops  instead of  the  items that they need in time of war or  in time of defense.  So I think our committee has done a  credible job in the total bill. I would  argue that we have cut too much in  procurement and  the  last  thing we  need is another $2.5 billion cut in addi tion to the $8 billion that we cut in  the committee.  ",1983
1561,128,22,Ms. FIEDLER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1562,128,22,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama., I yield  to the gentlewoman from California.  ,1983
1563,128,22,Ms.  FIEDLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  watched the debate regarding the de fense budget. It went  through both  the Budget Committee of which I am  a member and it came to the floor,  and the majority bill was accepted, not  the minority bill, but the majority bill  and they went through rather a good  deal of hassle between the House and  the Senate and between their Mem bers  to come up with a  figure  that  they  felt was  appropriate,  a  figure  that many of us felt was far too low.  Perhaps  the debate  regarding  the  total amount of spending should have  been done at that time. To come  in  here at this point with a $l1/2 or $21/2  billion  reduction without very  solid  evidence that this particular reduction  is one that is critically needed seems  to me to be totally out of place and  without  substantiation at  this  time  and really puts the gentleman offering  the bill in a position of contradicting  the budget agreement of his own ma jority party.  ",1983
1564,128,22,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
1565,128,22,Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama., I yield  to the gentleman from Washington.  ,1983
1566,141,22,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Chairman, I say  thank God we are a  representative  body in this House and that some of  us have fighting aged children, grand children, and brothers.  Let me tell you why. We have to put  this Lebanon situation to a very seri ous test and the test is  this: Do we  send our young men on a peacekeep ing mission where there is no peace? I  say that is mission impossible.  I want to point out that this amend ment, which I support, does not pre clude our Marines  from  being  sta tioned offshore. What it does do is end  our ground based presence, a prudent  and a sensible move.  Our will to bring peace in the Middle  East has never been questioned. We  can boast about the Camp David ac cords which were arrived at not militarily but politically.  of American  and  the Organization  States for this invasion.  We have been,  in effect,  trying to  overturn a government and prop up in  its place a new government  that  is  more to our liking.  In Lebanon we have moved in as a  peacekeeping force. We moved in with  the  support  of  our  allies-Britain,  France, and Italy-nations which have  castigated us for our invasion of Gre nada.  In one instance we are making war.  In the other we are making peace.  We have a great opportunity to give  a  peacemaking  opportunity  to  the  Mideast region, to allow the negotia tions a chance to work, to not under cut the potential that we have over  the next several months of giving the  government one last, albeit small, but  still existent opportunity to make this  country work.  I believe that in Grenada we ought  to end our presence, and we should  have a chance to vote on that today.  But in Lebanon we ought to stay and  give peace a chance.  I intend to off er an amendment that  would require the withdrawal of U.S.  Armed Forces from Grenada 15 days  after enactment of the Defense appro priations bill.  I would  like  to clarify  that. Since  that would be a limiting amendment,  under the new procedures there may  be a motion to rise before it may be  considered.  I urge my colleagues  to  def eat the motion to rise, regardless of  what position they may taken on the  issue. I repeat: The continued presence  of U.S. Armed Forces in Grenada is  something that should be voted on by  Congress, as the original invasion was  not.  It is time to bring U.S. Forces home  from Grenada. According to the State  Department, all Americans wishing to  leave Grenada-about half-have been  evacuated. All organized resistance to  the invasion of Grenada has ended.  United States Armed Forces should  not be used as an occupying force in  Grenada. We should remove this coun try from the tensions of the East-West  conflict.  Grenada is part of the British Com monwealth. If the Grenadians want an  interim military presence before elec tions, that presence should be supplied  by  fell ow  British  Commonwealth  countries.  The Secretary General of the Brit ish Commonwealth has already said  that a Commonwealth force could re place our forces within weeks. Canada  and New Zealand have already offered  to participate  in such a  force,  and  Great Britain has  indicated  that  it  would probably take part as well.  Our closest allies have been genuine ly enraged by the precipitous nature  of  invasion  of Grenada.  World tensions have been exacerbated,  and the relations among Caribbean nathe U.S.  This amendment will get us back on  that track, the diplomatic track, the  political track.  I hope the House has the courage to  pass  this needed amendment, and  I  yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair now  recognizes the gentleman from Michi gan <Mr. SILJANDER).  ",1983
1567,141,22,Mr. SILJANDER.," Mr. Chairman, I  think what we need to assess is what  price for  freedom are we willing  to  pay, what price for  freedom  in  the  world.  I believe we are in a growing attitude  of what I would term a creeping cow ardice. It is a Vietnam syndrome that  everything we look at in Grenada, in  Central America now, in fact, case in  point Lebanon, that it will be another  serious mistake  in American foreign  policy.  Maybe because we are too comf orta ble as American citizens, maybe be cause we are too flourishing here that  we can afford to have an isolationist  attitude.  But I would submit to the Members  of the House that our attitude must  change. We must assess what price we  are willing to pay for freedom world wide and what price we will pay for  our own courage.  Should we stay in Lebanon forever?  Certainly not.  The peace process  is now moving.  Every single major contributor to the  peace process has told the American  Government that it is because of the  multinational force and that is why  they are sitting down discussing this  very moment in Geneva, Switzerland,  a reconciliation process for Lebanon.  Is peace possible  in  that country?  From 1920  to 1958, nearly four dec ades-The CHAIRMAN.

1571,141,22,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in strong support of the amend ment and encourage the membership  to vote for it. My constituency, that  wonderful Middle Western State of  Michigan, my  constituency  strongly  supports this concept and hopes that  the Congress will  respond  to  the  wishes of the American people.  ",1983
1572,141,22,Mr. HERTEL of Michigan., I  thank  my good friend for the time and for  his excellent statement.  The  only  thing wrong with  this  amendment is the date certain. I agree  with  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  ,1983
1573,167,22,Mr. OXLEY., I will reclaim my time  simply  to  ask  the gentleman  from  Michigan then is he saying then that  this bill has no chance of passing and  indeed the only really attractive part  of this bill on the floor of the House  today  is  the fact that we will never  pass it and have it become law; is that  what the gentleman is saying?  ,1983
1574,167,22,Mr. ALBOSTA.," No; that is not so at  all. What I am saying is the MX mis sile bill, the Defense bill passed today,  and it had the MX in it, it has the  cruise in it, it has the B-1 bomber in  it.  What I am saying is let us pass this  legislation. Let us put it on the books  and let us see if it is not a bargaining  chip and get free, fair trade with all of  the nations of the world.  ",1983

1578,167,22,Mr. MARRIOTT.," It just seems  to  me the problems we have in this coun try are not associated with these types  of protectionist bills. For our automo bile industry to succeed we need more  prudent management, we need labor  and cost benefits  in  relationship  to  productivity. We need to build a better  automobile at lower prices and then I  think we will force people in this coun try by doing  that to buy U.S.-made  automobiles.  I would simply want to again make  the point that in the name of free en terprise and competition let us vote  down this bill. We all know what we  are going to do. I do not think we have  to continually go on with all kinds of  destructive  amendments.  Everyone  knows their position on this bill. Let  us have a vote.

Let me suggest to my friends on the  other side supporting this amendment,  and also repeatedly stating the con sumer aspect, that the facts show that  850,000 Subarus have been sold in the  United States since 1977, and 874,000  have been recalled; 84,000 of the 1980  models were  recalled. That was  to  keep the seats from falling over. And  43,000 of the 1981 and 1982 models  were  recalled  to keep  the  steering  wheels from coming off.  The point I am making is that they  are always talking about consumer leg islation and it is unfair. They make a  better car and we cannot compete.  The facts indicate that is not true.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. COATS  yielded his time to ",1983

1585,167,22,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I would  simply point out when we were talking  about consumerism, it seems to me the  height of arrogance for this Congress  to tell the American people what kind  of car they can buy, how much they  have to pay for it, because really that  is what we are talking about in this  legislation.  We should not turn our backs on the  consumers of this country, but allow  the consumer to make his own deci sion in the marketplace as he has done  so well over  the years and let him  decide, and not have to tell him what  kind of automobile he can buy.  I think that really is the bottom line  here. I think that is why you will see a  substantial negative vote on this legis lation because it really is not in the  best interests of the consumer and it  certainly is not in the best interest of  the country, as our friend from Flori da so ably pointed out.

1587,167,22,Mr. HERTEL of Michigan.," I thank  my distinguished colleague very much.  Mr. Chairman, you know we just fin ished the Defense appropriations bill.  With the world situation, we are all  very concerned about the defense of  this Nation.  Let me let all of you know that the  auto industry, the steel industry and  others are the backbone of the defense  industry of this country.  Detroit used to be known as the ar senal of democracy. The  reason we  won the Second World War was be cause the people in the auto industry  and related industries were ready and  prepared and strong enough to move  ahead and rearm America sufficiently.  Some people want  to  rely on  the  Japanese having a bigger slice of do mestic car sales  in this country. Let  me  tell  them  the Japanese Govern ment is not even willing to defend its  own nation; we are doing that; they  are not paying their fair share.  Let me tell them so that they can  understand  that our domestic auto makers want to go worldwide so they  can have more jobs in other countries.  Let me tell them that will weaken  our Nation again if we allow American  automobile companies  to build over seas.  Who is going to buy the cars if we do  not pay people a decent wage so that  they are employed? Who is going to  buy cars? What shape will this econo my be in then as bad as it is now?  The  fact  is we have over 300,000  Americans in the auto related indus tries unemployed. Their families are  suffering. They are concerned about  the future.  I have been here 3 years and I have  yet to hear any alternatives to the do mestic content bill, alternatives that  could work, that will send the message  to the Japanese to let them know that  we are not afraid to stand up and pro tect our industries as they have pro tected their industries.  We do harm to our economy in the  eyes of the world when we are afraid  to  stand up  for  our  own working  people and our own ability.

1591,180,22,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  tribute  to  ""Papa Bear"" George  Stanley Halas, Chicago Bears owner  for nearly six decades and founder of  the National Football League, who  died on Monday at the age of 88. The  entire city of Chicago has lost one of  its finest citizens and football enthusi asts throughout the country have lost  one of the great legends of the game.  Born on February 2, 1895, the son of  Bohemian  immigrants, George Halas  was destined to transform the game of  football  into a prominent American  sporting event and also into a major  entertainment industry. He attended  college at the University of  Illinois,  where he was a fierce competitor, and  excelled as a halfback and end in foot ball, as a basketball guard, and as a  baseball outfielder. After graduating  from college, he played professional  baseball for a short time for the New  York Yankees, until an injury ended  his promising baseball career. He soon  turned  his  energies  to  professional  football, where he laid the cornerstone  for the great game it is today.  At the time of his death, Mr. Halas  was the last survivor of a group of 12  men who founded in Canton, Ohio, on  September 17, 1920, what would later  become the National Football League.  He  loved the game and participated  with overwhelming success as a player,  an owner, and a coach. Under his out standing leadership and guiding spirit,  the Chicago Bears won the champion ship  in 1921, 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941,  1943, 1946, and in 1963, when at age  68, George Halas coached the Bears to  their last NFL title.  Through his nearly 64 seasons as a  Bear owner, Mr. Halas was the driving  force in the National Football League,  sustaining the league during its strug gling years and promoting it during its  years of prosperity. By the  time he  stopped coaching at age 73, his record,  including playoff games over four sep arate 10-year periods, was 320 wins,  14 7 losses, and 30 ties, for an impres sive .685 winning percentage.  Not only was he a great sportsman,  but also George Halas was a dedicated  and  active  community  leader.  Throughout his life he lent his name  and devoted much of his time to many  worthy community and neighborhood  projects, and charitable causes, and re ceived countless awards and accolades  for his humanitarian achievements. A  quiet and humble man off the playing  field, he often was an anonymous phi lanthropist, and  frequently declined  many awards and civic testimonials in  his honor.  George Halas was also  a  devoted  family man, and patriotic American,  who served our country with distinc tion in the Navy during both World  Wars. He was the director of the Met ropolitan Fair and Exposition Author ity which made possible the construc tion of McCormick Place in Chicago,  and also served on the board of St. Jo seph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana  and Loyola University. His humanitar ian concerns, business attributes, and  coaching  capabilities,  combined  to  make him a great citizen of the city of  Chicago. He will be sorely missed for  he won the hearts of all Chicagoans.  Not long ago he visited with me in my  Washington office, and it was a per sonal pleasure knowing a man of his  stature, dedication, and effectiveness.  George Halas will remain a legend in  the history of football and in the his tory of Chicago. Mrs. Annunzio and I  extend our deepest sympathy to the  members of his  family who  survive  him. His life was an inspiration to all  who had the privilege of knowing him  and he will never be forgotten.  Mr. Speaker, excerpts from an arti cle  about  the  life  and  accomplish ments of George Halas, from the No vember 1 edition of the Chicago Sun Times follow:  GEORGE HALAS DIES-OWNER OF BEARS WAS  88  <By Kevin Lamb)  Papa Bear is dead.  When George Stanley Halas died  in his  North Side apartment Monday evening, the  world lost a reassuring link with the past. In  an era when corporate symbols alternate be tween boardrooms and boredom, the Chica go Bears' patriarch recalled a  time when  successful people were big enough to reach  down for their bootstraps. The man actually  invented an entertainment business.  Mr. Halas had been  the  last surviving  founder of the National Football League for  several years before he died at 8:35 p.m. He  was 88 and had been ill with heart disease,  pancreatic cancer and other ailments  for  more than a year. He was declared dead by  Dr. Neal Stone,  said his grandson, Rich  McCaskey, Halas' daughter, Virginia Mccas key, was with him when he died, Mccaskey  said.  The Chicago Bears  franchise  that had  cost George Halas $100 in 1920 had grown in  value to an estimated $40 million.  ""I never thought it would be this big,"" Mr.  Halas said of the league on his 82nd birth day. ""My goodness, it was beyond compre hension.""  Professional football and Mr. Halas grew  side by side, each nurturing the other, until  the sport became a national institution and  the man became a legend.

Mr. Sayenga, an octogenerian hu manitarian, served as chairman for 10  years of the association, which is dedi cated to fighting myasthenia gravis, a  crippling  neuromuscular  disease  of  weakness.  Since 1955, when his daughter Carol  was  stricken with  the disease, Mr.  Sayenga has served on the board of di rectors of  the  association. He  now  serves as chairman emeritus. A World  War  I veteran, he  is a  retired vice  president of the Union National Bank.  The devotion of Mr. Sayenga to good  works has continued in his years of re tirement. For the past 7 years, he has  served as a volunteer driver 2 days a  week  for  the Brookine Meals  on  Wheels  program  for  the  elderly.  During the past 4 years, he has assist ed disabled veterans and their families  at the Oakland Veterans' Administra tion hospital.

1593,206,22,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  rare that I rise in support of an action  taken by President Reagan's adminis tration. But increasingly over the past  few weeks, we have seen one telecom munications  issue  that crosses party  lines. That is the issue of the future of  competition in the long distance serv ice business.  The August decision by the Federal  Communications  Commission  to  sharply  increase  the  tariff paid by  competitive carriers to access the local  network-known as ENFIA-will dev astate  this  nascent  industry.  The  Energy and Commerce Committee has  recognized  this and has embodied a  ""freeze"" on the ENFIA tariff in the  bill it reported last week, H.R. 4102.  This freeze, which was attached to  the  legislation  in  subcommittee by  Congressman BRYANT and myself, was  sustained in a vote in full committee  as well. There, on a motion to strike,  26  of  the committee's 42 members  agreed that the freeze was necessary  to preserve the future of competition  in the long distance business.  Now, the administration has taken a  similar position. In a  letter to Chair man Mark Fowler of the FCC, Secre tary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige  stated his support for the pending pe titions at the Commission to reconsid er the ENFIA increase. Furthermore,  the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration  <NTIA),  the  administration's  telecommunica tions policy voice, has filed comments  on behalf of the reconsideration peti tions.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that these are  harbingers  c,f what  the administra tion's policy will be  throughout the  debate over telecommunications legis lation. At the very least, I am encour aged by their support for an ENFIA  rollback, and therefore include a copy  of Secretary Baldrige's letter for the  RECORD:  DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE,  Washington, D.

1594,219,22,Mr.  STARK.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am pleased to have my colleagues, Mr.  FORD of Tennessee, Mr. DOWNEY of  New York, Mr. FOWLER, Mr. MATSUI,  and Mr. SHANNON  join with me in in troducing  legislation  to make  the  earned income tax credit <EITC> the  meaningful credit it was originally in tended to be. By raising the maximum  eligibility and benefit levels and elimi nating its interaction with the aid to  families with dependent children pro gram,  this proposal will  restore  the  goals of the earned income tax credit  in aiding the working poor.  Through the 1960's and 1970's Con gress attempted, through several tax  reduction bills  to eliminate  the  tax  burden  on  families whose  incomes  were below the poverty line. It did this  by  increasing  to above  the poverty  level the amount of income at which a  family  begins  to pay  income  tax termed the tax threshold or tax entry  point. Several tools have been used to  achieve this goal: The personal exemp tion, the zero bracket amount, and the  earned income tax credit. In the past  few years, however,  these provisions  have not kept pace with inflation, and  as a result the income tax threshold  has fallen well below the poverty line.  This shortfall will continue  to grow  for too many poor families even after  indexing takes effect in 1985, because  the earned  income  tax credit  is not  slated to be  increased nor are there  plans  to  increase  the  income  levels  qualifying for the credit. According to  the staff of the Joint Commiteee on  Taxation, one of the ""most cost-eff ec tive tools to reduce the tax burden of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the poor"" has been the earned income  tax credit <EITC).  EITC-HOW IT WORKS  Although  little known  and  infre quently ref erred to, the EITC is one of  the  five major welfare programs  in  this country. Last year some 6.9 mil lion families benefited from the EITC  credits, with  1.9 million  receiving  lower tax bills and 5 million getting re funds from the Treasury. Established  in 1975, the EITC is a  tax credit in tended to provide a cash income sup plement to working parents with rela tively low earnings. It should be em phasized that this is the only program  specifically available to working cou ples who have a  least one dependent  child. Also the EITC is the only tax  credit which is ""refundable,"" meaning  that a person does not need to owe  any income tax to receive the credit.  For those whose tax liability is smaller  than the credit, the Internal Revenue  Service makes a direct payment of the  credit.  Under current law, a refundable tax  credit is available to a parent-or par ents-with  earnings whose  adjusted  gross income is not above $10,000 an nually and who maintain a household  for, first, a child who is either under  19 or a student; or second, a son or  daughter who is an adult but disabled  and who can be claimed as a tax de pendent. The credit equals 10 percent  of  the  first $5,000 of earnings. Be tween earnings of $5,000 and $6,000  the maximum credit of $500  is  re ceived. For each dollar of adjusted  gross income above $6,000 the credit is  reduced by 12.5 cents and phases out  at $10,000. To  receive  the credit, a  person must either file an income tax  return at the end of the tax year or  file an earned income eligibility certifi cate with their employer for advance  payments of the credit.  Congress enacted the EITC to serve  as an offset against income and pay roll taxes for the working poor. It was  also meant to be a work incentive as  an earnings  subsidy  for  low-income  wage earners.  RISE OF POVERTY /EROSION OF EITC  Mr. Speaker, these laudable goals of  the EITC program  to aid America's  working poor have been badly eroded.  Hearings by two Ways and Means sub committees held last week dramatized  the extent  to which  the EITC and  other  Federal  programs  aimed  at  eliminating poverty  in  this country  have failed. In short the ""war on pov erty"" has been reduced to a skirmish.  The Congressional Budget Director  Randolph Penner reported the rate of  poverty  has  jumped  sharply  since  1978. Today a shocking 15 percent of  the  population-the  highest  since  1965,  is  struggling  in poverty. This  means that the number of Americans  considered  officially  poor  has  in creased from 24.5 million to a record  34.4 million  in 1983. These statistics  30591  are particularly ominous, because Gov ernment figures show that more than  half of those who joined the poverty  ranks in 1981 and 1982 were adults or  children  in  traditional husband and  wife families. Female heads of house hold also show an increase in poverty.  This is because one out of three full time working women earn  less  than  $7,000 and three out of five earn less  than $10,000. According to several wit nesses at the hearing, a return to eco nomic growth will not bring rapid im provement for these groups.  It has been argued that if we count  cash and inkind benefits, the rate of  poverty would be reduced to 9 percent.  However, even if we count these bene fits,  Economist Timothy Smeeding,  who  authored  the  recent  Census  Bureau report to Congress on the ef fects of inkind benefits on poverty, es timates that since 1972 poverty has in creased by 50 percent. More  impor tantly, the Urban Institute has con cluded  that major  reductions  in  income-related  benefit  payments  ""were done in a manner that creates  major work disincentives for the near  and working poor."" They go on to say  that the changes could  increase the  vulnerability of the working poor to  economic dependency. Given the high  rate of unemployment, the last thing  we should be doing is increasing disin centives to work. The EITC, unlike the  other  entitlement  programs  was  meant to serve as a work incentive. By  increasing the EITC we could offset  the disincentive  resulting  from  the  loss of benefits and significantly  in crease the incentives to work harder  or seek higher paying jobs.  Both Mr. Penner of CBO, and Mr.  Smeeding testified that increasing the  size of the credit and/ or lowering the  phaseout would aid the working poor  and lower the work disincentive.  Major cuts in social programs is but  one of the reasons for the rise in pov erty. The recession, high unemploy ment, and an increase in the number  of families headed by females have all  added to the problem. However, these  are all fairly obvious reasons and the  Congress has begun to address them.  TAXING THE POOR  Less obvious and a frequently over looked  factor  is  the  growing  tax  burden on lower income wage earners.  Mr.  Smeeding  estimates  that,  not  counting State  and  local  taxes,  a  family of four at the poverty line $9,862-paid $956 in income and pay roll  taxes  last year. While Federal  income  and payroll  taxes have  in creased from $35 in 1978 to $440 for a  family of three with earnings equal to  the  poverty  threshold-$7,690. We  must ask why has the taxation level so  sharply  increased  for  those already  struggling in poverty. The answers are  found in the ""bracket creep"" resulting  ",1983
1595,232,22,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I  rise  today  to again encourage President  Reagan to insist that the Cuban Gov ernment agree to take back the Cuban  nationals  incarcerated  in  prisons  throughout  the United States as a  condition of  repatriation of Cubans  captured in Grenada. Hostilities have  ceased on Grenada and the wounded  have been returned to Havana. It is  my understanding  that  the  repatri ation of the able-bodied Cuban nation als now held on Grenada will  take  place in the next few days.  It looks doubtful now that the repa triation of the Cuban nationals will in clude the condition recommended by  the Senate to return the Cuban pris oners incarcerated in prisons through out the United States since the Mariel  Boat Lift of 1980. As the sponsor of  the amendment with 26 other Sena tors recommending this action to the  President, I will sorely regret it if the  administration  throws away  this op portunity to return the criminals Fidel  Castro forced upon the United States.  The U.S. Government has been at tempting to return the Cuban crimi nals to Cuba for 4 years but the Castro  government refuses to cooperate. The  administration should not ignore the  best point of leverage we have had in  dealing with the thousands of Cuban  criminals we have housed since 1980. I  again  ask  the  administration  to  comply with the Senate recommenda tion adopted last Friday.  I have heard that some Members of  the Senate and the administration feel  that  the condition  recommended by  the Senate is illegal or unconstitution al. But, no one will really be specific.  Some were afraid that the amendment  would violate U.S. immigration law. I  would contend that it would not. My  amendment was carefully directed at  those Cuban aliens already classified  as deportable under our immigration  laws, who  in most  instances would  have been deported  to  their home  countries  almost  immediately. But,  Cuba led by Mr. Castro would not take  them.  Some contend that my amendment  was violating the civil liberties of the  Cuban criminals. My response is that  these illegal aliens have been afforded  more due process and attention than  most illegal aliens ever receive. Again,  the persons to whom my amendment  is addressed are  those who have al ready been classified as excludable en trants who never would have been al lowed to enter the United States if we  had better control of the situation and  our borders. Instead, Fidel Castro had  control.  Some contend that the Senate rec ommendation violates the sentiments  of the Geneva Convention. I would ask  how? Hostilities had not ended in Gre nada when the Senate acted on my  recommendation and the negotiations  on repatriating the Cuban nationals  had not even begun. My amendment  certainly did not  call  for,  or  even  imply, torturing or brainwashing the  captured. I did not advocate holding  the prisoners hostage. My amendment  solely  recommended  that  the Presi dent consider the condition of return ing  the Cuban  criminals with  the  Cubans captured in Grenada.  Mr. President,  the  administration  will be doing us a great disservice by  allowing  the  Cuban  criminals  to  remain in our prisons and letting this  opportunity to return them slip by.  Yes, we will continue to spend mil lions  housing  them,  feeding  them,  guarding  them, and providing  them  legal counsel.  Yes, we will continue to jeopardize  the American public's security by al lowing them to remain here.  Yes, we will continue to crowd our  overcrowded penal  institutions with  this some 6,000 Cuban Nationals.  But, even more irritating and humil iating to the United States is the fact  that Mr. Castro will continue to have  his way.  In one of the communiques issued to  the State Department during the past  week Castro stated:  Let the Government of the United States  not even think that the bodies of the dead  caused by  the  cowardly  attack, nor  the  wounded in heroic combats, or the compa triots illegally retained by its Armed forces,  can be used to blackmail, pressure and hu miliate Cuba!  Humiliate Cuba indeed-Mr. Castro  has been humiliating  the American  public ever since he used  the many  Floridians who  rushed  to Cuba  to  carry their families and relatives back  to the United States. Instead of rela tives,  the  shocked Floridians  found  that they were  forced  to  take hun dreds of Cuba's more undesirable in mates of prisons and mental hospitals.  Castro did not want  them. So, he  thrust them upon us. And, because our  immigration policy was weak and un definitive, we took them and yes, we  were humiliated.  Mr. President, the support for this  recommendation  on  returning  the  Cuban criminals has been overwhelm ing. Not only are the people of Florida  behind the Senate's recommendation,  but I have received responses from all  over the country. ""Make Castro take  them back"" is the theme of most of  the calls and letters.  I sincerely hope the administration  is not going  to  let  this opportunity  pass us by. I call on the President to  heed  the Senate's  recommendation  and ""make Castro take them back"". It  is about time.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD a  study by the Congressional Research  Service outlining  the  fact  that  this  would be legal action.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,  THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,  Washington, D.C., November 2, 1983.  To: Hon.

1596,245,22,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  today marks only  the seventh  time  that a separate budget authorization  bill has been introduced for U.S. intel ligence activities. The budget authori zation process is now standard proce and  represents  clear  evidence  dure  that our constitutional responsibilities  can be  fulfilled while, at  the same  time, maintaining the confidentiality  necessary for an effective intelligence  system.  No other nation in the world does  what we have been doing now for the  past 7 years. No other nation in the  world allows its legislative branch to  oversee,  in detail, and authorize the  budget for its intelligence community.  In my  judgment,  this  is  the best  system there is to provide accountabil ity for the intelligence activities of our  Government. The annual authoriza tion process  is  now  an  established  practice in our Government. I  think  that it works very well to insure that  we have a strong and effective intelli gence  community which  is,  at  the  same time, responsive to the needs of  our people.  Earlier this year,  the Budget Sub committee of the Senate Select Com mittee on Intelligence held numerous  closed hearings and we have engaged  in hundreds of hours of staff  inter views and briefings in putting together  the bill which is on the floor today.  We have examined in detail the budg ets of the Central Intelligence Agency,  the National Security Agency, and the  intelligence activities of  the Depart ments of Defense, State, and Treas ury, and of the Federal Bureau of In vestigation.  Additionally, the full committee met  many  times  to  further  refine  this  budget authorization bill. In particu lar, we devoted a tremendous amount  of attention  to  the administration's  covert action requests. So I want to re affirm to my colleagues  the serious ness with which we take our responsi bilities for authorizing these activities.  Also, I wish to reiterate to all Mem bers  that documentary materials  in  possession of the committee are avail able  for  review. If Members have a  question about what we are doing or  what we have done, they should let us  know, and we will be glad  to share  these materials with them under the  provisions of Senate Resolution 400.  Mr.  President,  I  thank my  col leagues, in particular, Senator WALLOP  and Senator INOUYE, the distinguished  chairman and vice chairman of our  Budget Subcommittee, for their hard  work and effort in preparing this legis lation. These two gentlemen and their  colleagues on the Budget Subcommit tee are responsible for much of the  work, and they are to be commended  for it. Given the extremely short time  period we have had to finish this proc ess this year, I want to say that the co operation  and  patience  that  was  shown to us by all concerned was a  tribute  to  the professional attitude  and dedication of these people.

It is an unusual event for a contro versial bill such as S. 1715 to be called  up this late in the session. The last  time we passed the Natural Gas Act,  which was finalized  in 1978,  it  took  several weeks on this floor, and when  it went into conference it took a year  to complete the conference committee  work  to  finally  have  a  conference  report available  to vote on by  the  Senate and the House.  So there is no idea that by springing  S. 1715 in the waning days of this Con gress it would be enacted into law. The  question really is, What would be en acted into law if a bill is going to be  passed? Since  that is not clear,  the  debate on the motion to proceed has  served the purpose of attempting to  smoke out from  the various groups  what particular type of package a sub stitute bill would be proposed  that  might garner a majority vote in the  Senate.  Naturally, that is going to take some  time. After it is debated, it will still  take a  lot of study by various people  throughout  the  various  groups  throughout the country that are inter ested in a natural gas bill.  I have no real strong feeling about  cloture, except to this extent: I shall  vote against cloture because I  retain  then to myself the greatest amount of  options and  the greatest amount of  flexibility in consideration of anything  that might follow dealing with natural  gas in this session and in the next ses sion of Congress.  The position we may find ourselves  in if cloture is invoked is a rapid proce dure to the motion to proceed and a  vote on that, and then, fallowing that,  rapid consideration of S. 1715.  By saying ""rapid consideration,"" I do  not mean that it will be a rapid pas sage. I do not think that is possible. I  think what we will  find  ourselves  doing  is  from  time  to  time coming  back on natural gas amendments and  proposals intertwined among the con sideration of other urgent legislation.  ",1983

1602,310,22,Mr.  STEVENS.," Mr.  President,  I  know that the Senate would  like  to  vote, and I do want to vote. I just want  to point this out.  We are now producing 720  tanks a  year. Starting in fiscal year 1984, one third of them will go to war reserves;  one-third to POMCUS for storage in  warehouses in Europe; and one-third  to the Active Force. So by increasing  production another 120 per year, you  are not getting any more tanks, any  great number to the Active Force, but  are increasing the cost of getting these  things and storing them somewhere in  the event something might happen in  the future.  I  say  that we  should maintain a  steady rate of production. I listened to  the Senator from Michigan and he  said we should have 840, and he would  like to go to 1,000 and maybe higher  than that.  I asked where he was going to get  the money. I want to see how people  vote on this. That is why I brought it  up.  Everyone has been telling me, ""You  have to cut the defense budget."" I am  the chairman of  the sub-committee,  and I am giving you a chance to cut  the defense budget. If people are sin cere about cutting the defense budget,  here is a chance to cut it to what the  President of  the United States  re quested-720 tanks a year. If we want  to  start  spending more  than  the  budget for defense, this is the time to  do it.  People will tell us, ""Let's cut out M l  tanks and multiyear production and  a  lot of other things."" But this is a  test. This is going to fall on the ears of  the American public, by  the people  who are going to increase the number  of tanks solely for economic reasons,  in terms of jobs in certain localities in  the country. We could spend our way  into oblivion that way.  It is not right to increase the rate of  production of a very significant por tion  of  the Department's  arsenal  beyond what they have requested. We  will still produce, if my amendment is  adopted, 120 more tanks a year than  the Bradley  fighting  vehicle.  Two  years later we can produce the same  number of tanks and will not have to  borrow the money long in advance to  produce them.  I knew what  I was doing when  I  brought this up, because I want people  to  think;  and  I  think  the Senate  face  these  should  think before we  other amendments.  How many people are now going to  increase the budget for defense over  and above the President's request, just  for the purpose of producing 120 more  tanks per year in order to have a jobs  program out of the Department of De fense?  ",1983
1603,310,22,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, first,  I  should like to correct my friend from  Alaska on the question of where these  120  additional  tanks  in  fiscal  1984  would be deployed. We have asked the  Army where they would be distribut ed. They will not go into POMCUS or  war reserves. As a matter of fact, these  120 will go directly to Active and Na tional Guard Forces  in  the United  States and Europe, 51  to U.S.-based  active units, 26 to the National Guard  and 43  to active Army units in West ern Europe, according to official Army  documents.  ",1983
1604,310,22,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  finally,  on the question of whether or not this  is a  jobs bill: This is a conventional  military strength catchup bill, and it is  long overdue.  We have been saying year after year  after year-President Carter said  it;  President Reagan  said  it-that we  would get to a 1,080-per-year tank pro duction rate long before now. Presi dent Carter said it in 1979. He said we  would get  to 1,080  tank production  rate by 1982.  A month after President Reagan  came to office, based on strengthening  our conventional forces-in part, that  was  his  election promise-President  Reagan said we would get to 1,080 pro duction rate by 1984. We are at 1984.  That is what this budget is.  The question now is whether we are  going to do what we all know we must  do just to try to close the gap between  us and the Soviets in Europe, in the  area of tank numbers. We finally have  a better tank, but it is not going to do  us much good if we are outnumbered 4  to 1.  Last week, we heard from command er of all our Army troops in Europe,  Gen. Glenn K. Otis, as to how beauti fully the M-1 tank has performed in  the recent Reforger combat exercises  and how much it is needed on military  grounds. That  is why  this  tank  is  needed, because we need the conven tional strength. General Otis said the  following:  ... the M-1 again demonstrated that it  was the best tank on the battlefied in Re forger '83, and that it represents a major  improvement  to our Army's conventional  combat capabilities.  I ask unanimous consent that Gen eral Otis complete letter be included  in the RECORD at this point. It is a  strong demonstration of the need for  procuring 840 M-l's, not 720, in fiscal  1984.

1616,349,22,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, I am pleased to join the distin guished chairman of the Senate Hous ing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee  in introducing the Condominium Cost  Reduction Act.  In today's housing market, there is  little opportunity  for  the  lowand  moderate-income  Americans  to  achieve what has  always  been  de scribed as the American dream, home ownership. Rising land and construc tion costs coupled with exorbitant in terest rates have kept homeownership  only a dream for Americans with limit ed financial resources.  Condominiums  and  cooperatives  have  emerged  as  alternatives  still  available  to  this group. However, an  anomaly in our tax laws hinders the  ability of  rental building owners  to  convert to affordable homeownership  units.  Currently,  if an owner converts a  building  to condominiums and  sells  the units, all the profit is taxed at or dinary income rates. However,  if the  owner contracts with a converter, in  effect a middleman, the owner's profit  is  taxed at capital gains rates while  the converter pays the ordinary  tax  rate. Hence, the existing incentive en courages the latter.  By  involving a middleman  in  the  conversion process, a number of prob lems are created. For instance, a converter will borrow short-term capital  to purchase the building and complete  any improvements that may be neces sary, often paying high interest rates  in the process. This creates an upward  pressure on unit prices and forces the  converter to promote rapid sale of con verted units.  Our bill seeks to eliminate the Tax  Code-induced pressure for owners who  sell to converters. Under our bill an  owner who converts an apartment to  condominiums will have  the profits  taxed at capital gains rates if he or she  has owned the building for 5 years or  more. Any profit realized beyond the  gain in building value as determined  by the date of conversion will be taxed  at ordinary rates.  If enacted, our bill would decrease  the cost of conversion and allow a less  hectic conversion. In this process, the  renting tenant would have a greater  opportunity to purchase a unit rather  than being driven out by the inflexi bility and quick sale pressure created  by the use of short-term expensive fi nancing by converters  influenced by  current tax law.  This legislation would not have sig nificant  revenue  impact  and  only  changes a portion of the Code that en courages  tax motivated business ar rangements and higher costs to condo  buyers.  I hope my colleagues will agree and  that we can take timely action toward  enacting this bill.e  By Mr. ANDREWS:  S. 2047.

1617,349,22,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing  for  the  consider ation of the Senate legislation to pro vide for stabilization of fares  in the  airline industry, without re-regulation.  Essentially,  its modest purpose  is  to  impose  some order  and predictable  regularity to a pricing regime which  has become a  crazy quilt of rapidly  changing fares which baffle the con sumer and travel industry, and which  undermine the possibility of orderly,  and sound financial planning for the  airlines.  The bill simply  requires  reinstate ment of tariff-filing requirements with  60-day notice-30 days  for matching  fares. The  bill would  also  require  fares, as filed, to remain in effect for  at least 90 days, except to match an other carrier's price change.  I am aware that the state of the air line  industry  is of great concern  to  many of my colleagues. This is a com plicated problem brought about by  many factors ranging from the reces sion to implementation of the Airline  Deregulation Act of 1978. There may  ",1983
1618,362,22,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  when the Senate Commerce Commit tee reported S. 1660, relating to the  Federal Communications Commission  residential access fee decision and uni versal telephone service, the commit tee did not have the benefit of com ments  from  the Commission. The  Chairman  of  the Commission, Mr.  Fowler, did appear as the first witness  at the hearing of July 28, but we did  not have the comments of the FCC on  the final draft of the bill.  As chairman of the Communications  Subcommittee,  I wrote  to Chairman  Fowler  inviting him  to comment on  the bill as reported. On October 31,  the full Commission replied to my in quiry.  In the reply,  the Commission  sets forth its strong opposition to the  bill and recommends substantial revi sions  to correct serious  flaws  in S.  1660,  should Congress  nevertheless  pursue the measure.  Mr. President, I agree with the FCC  opposition to S. 1660. I  feel strongly  that there is no immediate need to act  on the legislation and that it would  harm consumers and the future of the  telecommunications  industry  if  the  bill should pass.  So that all my colleagues may better  understand this subject and realize its  broad, harmful consequences, I submit  the FCC letter for the RECORD.  The letter follows:  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS  COMMISSION,  Washington, D.C., October 31, 1983.  Hon. BARRY GOLDWATER,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Communica tions, Committee on Commerce, Science  and Transportation, U.S. Senate, Wash ington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR GOLDWATER: This is in re sponse to your letter of October 13 inviting  the Chairman to submit the Commission's  views regarding S. 1660, as reported by the  Senate Commerce Committee. Because of  the obvious importance of this issue and be cause of our belief that the FCC has chosen  a  course  in  its access orders which most  fully realizes the goals set out by Congress  in  the Communications Act of 1934,  the  Commission is pleased to submit these com ments for your consideration.  We  fully  realize  that  this agency,  the  courts, and the Congress have been grap pling with the difficult issues this bill ad dresses. It is our hope that the additional  material we are submitting will dissuade the  Committee from passing legislation which  we believe to be counter-productive to the  goals the Congress is trying to achieve, and  that the Congress will give the agency the  opportunity to complement its decision with  Congress' rigorous and continued oversight.  We stand by our access charge decision.  Legislation is unnecessary, and S. 1660 will  disserve  the  public  interest.  Chairman  Fowler has previously submitted testimony  to the Committee as to the desirability of an  access charge system  that  includes  fixed  monthly charges  for non-traffic  sensitive  <NTS) costs. The proposed two-year morato rium on most end user access charges would  delay the economic benefits that the access  charge plan was designed to produce.  Uneconomic bypass would be encouraged  while  the moratorium  is  in effect. Large  users who leave the network during such a  moratorium would not return because they  will have made a  large investment in their  bypass facilities in the interim. Therefore,  the delay of two years, coupled with uncer tainty afterwards, would have serious conse quences for network preservation and uni versal  service  in an  industry marked by  rapid technological change.  As the Committee is no doubt aware, fears  of doubled or  tripled  telephone  rates be cause of the FCC's access charge decision  are proving unfounded. The access charges  could not, by  themselves, cause such per centage increases; these could result only if  rate  increase requests pending before  the  various states were granted in their entirety. As we predicted, however, states are dis allowing large parts of the rate hikes re quested by telephone companies. As of Oc tober 13, 1983, the state commissions had  disallowed 62 percent of  the Bell System  rate  requests  reviewed. For example, on  August 31, 1983, Georgia disallowed almost  90 percent of the rate increase requested by  Southern Bell; on September 7, 1983, New  York disallowed 68 percent of the rate in crease requested by New York Telephone;  and, effective October 1, 1983, Michigan had  disallowed 64 percent of the rate increase  requested by Michigan Bell.  These developments confirm that action  by Congress is unnecessary this year. As was  stated by Chairman Fowler in his previous  testimony,  the $2.00  residential  interstate  access charge will not have any significant  impact in 1984. Congress can afford to take  the time to see how the Commission's plan  works.  If Congress disagrees with this assessment  and decides to go forward with legislation,  we believe that substantial revisions are es sential to S. 1660, especially in those provi sions  concerning  the Universal  Service  Fund, lifeline subsidies, new joint board pro cedures, bypasser charges, and Alaska rate  integration. Provisions of the bill relating to  these  areas  contain  serious  flaws  that  should be corrected before S. 1660  is en acted into law. Once the bill is enacted, and  deficiencies will be almost impossible to cor rect. For example, while  the Commission  now has flexibility  to adjust eligibility re quirements for the Universal Service Fund,  the rigid requirements in the bill will quick ly become outdated. The agency would be  powerless to make corrections to the bill's  immutable terms.  The major problem areas include the fol lowing:  The bill  restricts eligibility  for support  from the Universal Service Fund to elimi nate over three-fourths of the support that  the Joint Board plan would provide for local  exchange rates in high cost areas. Millions  of  telephone  subscribers will pay higher  local  telephone rates under the bill  than  under the Joint Board plan. Thirty-eight  states <and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is lands)  receive  less support under the bill  than under the Joint Board plan; six states  and D.C. are unaffected under both plans;  and even the remaining six states which do  somewhat better under the bill individually  receive less than $1 million more support.  See Attachment 1.  Because the bill makes subscribers in high  cost areas which are served by larger compa nies ineligible for support, it will have the  inequitable result of subjecting subscribers  served by larger companies to higher tele phone bills than their neighbors served by  smaller telephone companies, even though  there is no difference in the costs of service.  The bill makes it too easy for carriers to  qualify for very substantial high cost sup port, perverting incentives to keep costs low  and efficiency high. In contrast, the Joint  Board plan is specifically designed to pro vide supports at less generous levels. Under  the Joint Board plan, inefficient companies  would lose more than they gained by their  inefficiencies and only  carriers with un avoidable high costs could avail themselves  of subsidy funds.  The bill attempts to control interstate re imbursement in high cost situations by re quiring state regulators to certify that the  high costs are reasonably incurred. Know ing that certification of high costs would en title  local exchange carriers  to draw sub",1983
1619,375,22,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr.  President,  in  recent weeks, the people of this coun try have been faced with two interna tional crises  that have  involved  the  use of American forces and the loss of  American lives outside the borders of  the United States. One was the brutal  and tragic bombing of the Marine bar racks  in Beirut. The other was  the  armed American invasion and occupa tion of the Caribbean island of Grena da.  Each of these crises has raised basic  and  immediate  questions-questions  about why American troops were sent  to Lebanon and Grenada in the first  place, what their purpose is for stay ing, and how long it will take them to  accomplish their objectives. All these  questions  are  extremely  important,  and  they  all  deserve  prompt  and  public response.  But recent events have also raised a  more  fundamental  and  far-reaching  question that we have tended to gloss  over in the heat of current crises. In  both Lebanon and Grenada, the intro duction of American forces was under taken at the initiative of the President  alone, without prior authorization by  the Congress. The question raised by  such unilateral action is what, if any,  role the Congress and the American  people  are  to play  in  determining  whether U.S.  troops should be com mitted to hostilities on foreign soil.  In the context of current events, this  question may seem to be an esoteric  one. But it is a question that goes to  the very foundation of our governmen tal structure and the delicate system  of checks and balances embodied  in  our Constitution. It is a question that  we can no longer afford to answer on a  purely pragmatic and piecemeal basis.  Our Founding Fathers gave  clear  and distinct directions as to who was  to hold the warmaking authority  in  the new Nation they were fashioning.  In the Constitution,  they designated  the President as  the Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces, or, as Al exander Hamilton described it in the  Federalist Papers, ""the first General  and Admiral of the Confederacy."" But  they specifically left the power to use  those Armed Forces-the power to de clare war-in the hands of the Con gress. The notes of the original Consti tutional Convention  leave no doubt  that the Framers intended to give the  President independent warmaking au thority only ""to repel sudden attacks""  upon the United States. All other au thority relating to the commitment of  the Nation to war was to be vested ex clusively in the Congress.  The decision of the Framers to place  the warmaking power in the legislative  branch was based primarily on their  fear  that the monarchical  tyrannies  from which they had just gained free dom would recur in their new Nation.  To avoid the known dangers of con centrating  the  awesome  power  to  make war in any one man, they placed  it instead in the governmental body  most directly representative of and re sponsive to popular sentiment. In this  way, they sought to give the American  people a stronger voice  in their own  destiny and to eliminate the possibility  of  future oppressive and unpopular  wars. The benefit of congressional con trol over the use of armed force was  succinctly noted by Thomas Jefferson  in a  letter  to James Madison:  ""We  have already given in example one ef fectual check on the Dog of war by  transferring the power of letting him  loose from the executive to the legisla tive body     *""  Throughout the first hundred years  of this country's history, few questions  were raised about the Congress' ulti mate responsibility for committing the  Nation's Armed  Forces  to  combat.  Abraham Lincoln, speaking as a Con gressman against an unauthorized use  of American troops by President Polk,  warned specifically of the dangers in herent in executive usurpation of the  congressional warmaking power:  Allow a President to invade a neighboring  nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary  to repel an invasion, and you allow him to  do so, whenever he may choose to say he  deems  it necessary for such purpose-and  you allow him to make war at pleasure.  It was not until  the 20th century  that ""making war at pleasure"" became  a consistent, rather than an occasion al, practice. Time and again during  this century, Presidents sent American  troops into foreign hostilities without  prior authorization from the Congress.  Our forces were sent into armed con flicts around the globe-into Central  America and South America, into the  Caribbean, into the Far East and the  Middle East, and most notably  into  Southeast Asia-all in the name of the  national interest, all at the individual  initiative of the President, and all with  only ex post facto approval by the gov ernmental body holding the exclusive  power to make such commitments. In  1964, the nadir of congressional con trol and the height of congressional  acquiescence was reached by the pas sage of the Gulf of Tonkien resolu tion, which gave the President virtual ly limitless power to use armed mili tary force in Southeast Asia. The state  of affairs existing at the end of the  1960's was aptly described by Senator  Jacob Javits:  We  live  in an age of undeclared war,  which has meant Presidential war. Pro longed engagement in undeclared, Presiden tial wars has created a most dangerous im balance  in our Constitutional  system of  checks and balances.  In 1973, Congress began the process  of  recapturing  its constitutional au thority over the making of war by the  passage of the War Powers Resolution.  The  resolution  recognized  that  modern  times may  in some circum stances justify the exercise of immedi ate military  force by  the President,  but it also sets  limits on the Presi dent's ability  to maintain a military  presence  in areas of hostile activity  without  explicit  authorization  from  Congress. Specifically,  it states  that  the President may, in urgent circum stances, inject armed American forces  into  actual  or  potential  hostilities.  However, before doing so, he or she  must take every possible step to con sult with Congress,  and within  48  hours of the troop commitment, must  issue a detailed report outlining the  purpose and estimated duration of the  American involvement. All U.S. troops  must be withdrawn from the area of  hostilities within 60 days unless Con gress specifically authorizes a  longer  term of activity.  There is no doubt in my mind that  the passage of the War Powers Reso lution constituted a vital step toward  reestablishing the proper balance be tween  the  executive  and  legislative  branches in the realm of warmaking  authority. More importantly, it consti tuted a vital step toward amplifying  the voice of American people in discus sions and decisions on the fundamen tal issue of whether there should be  war or peace.  But the existence of the War Powers  Resolution  is not enough  in  itself.  Without implementation, it is nothing  more than a piece of paper. Those of  us who are concerned about maintain ing  the  constitutional  system  of  ",1983

I  am paraphrasing now, but if the Mem bers will read the RECORD from yester day that is under their seats, they will  find that he said it very bluntly and  honestly, and there can be no question  where he stands on this legislation. He  has opposed it for years, and he has  done it openly. He has given his rea sons for opposing  it. He and I have  had our disagreements-very spirited  ones-during the last 2 years over his  reasons.  But he did say last night, as one who  believes that this bill should not pass  under  any  circumstances,  that  this  amendment has the same effect as an  amendment to strike all after the en acting clause.  Now, if we want to do it that way, we  should come on out in Main Street so  that people can see us. We should not  go skulking down the alley and try to  kill this bill by shooting it in the back  in a dark alley. The gentleman should  stand up and off er a motion to strike  all after the enacting clause and see  how  the House stands on  that. He  should not try to do  it through the  back door.  I do not ascribe any less than the  highest motives  to  the  gentleman  from Indiana, but if indeed he feels as  sincere as he has described his feelings  about this amendment, then he ought  to recognize that at this point he has  become an  instrument  to do  some thing  far more  draconian  and  far  broader than he had anticipated, not  only to this legislation but to our rela tionship with 87 other countries with  whom we have to trade and to whom  we have to try to sell our goods.  I have heard a  lot of  talk about  sending messages. If we want to send a  message to the other 87 trading coun tries that GATT does not mean a tin ker's dam when  it  is convenient for  them to run around it and create a  new device  to substitute their courts  appointed by their government for our  equal standing in GATT. If we want to  send that message, we can vote for the  Coats amendment. If we want to pre serve GATT and we want to go on and  consider the problems that the gentle man has raised, let us consider them  in  amendments  that  are  properly  drafted to accomplish that purpose.  ",1983
1623,401,22,Mr. LUNDINE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the Coats amendment.  I do so because I believe it is unwise to  include a provision  in  this bill  that  would in essence leave the determina tion of the terms for implementation  of  this bill  to the U.S. courts. This  amendment would do so by entitling  other countries to seek compensation  under our law if there is a finding that  this bill in some way violates the pro visions of GATT.  It is not clear whether or not this  bill would violate GATT. There are  procedures  established  under  the  GATT to make that determination if  indeed a foreign nation wishes to chal lenge the provisions of this law. And  there are also procedures established  under the GA TT for consideration of  possible foreign retaliatory measures.  In any event it seems to me such a  proceeding will  be  very  interesting  given the fact that many nations of  the world already have in place con tent requirements for various  indus tries.  I support this bill, not because it is a  perfect prescription for the problems  that plague our auto  industry, but  rather because I believe  that House  passage of  this bill  is an  important  first step  toward dealing with  those  problems. Currently, we have no trade  policy. It is largely because we have no  trade policy that has brought us  to  this point. And until we develop the  determination  to coordinate a  trade  policy that will insure a healthy indus trial future for this country, bills like  auto content must continue to receive  support.  I also cannot stand here and tell you  that  I  believe  that GATT  is  the  answer  to our problems. While we  must certainly strive to  improve the  GATT framework and to work coop eratively with other nations to resolve  trade problems, at the same time, we  must realize  that in many  instances  GATT is  today totally  ineffective  in  dealing with many problems  facing  our internationally traded businesses.  The problem of foreign  targeting of  industries, for example, cannot be re solved  under  the  existing  GATT  framework  in  a  timely or effective  way. This is primarily because many  of the  instruments being utilized by  some of our trading partners for ad vancing the interests of their own in dustries are not addressed  in GATT  standards or procedures.  Finally, we should not adopt a provi sion in this bill which will give foreign  nations or  firms  standing or access  under U.S.  law  to  seek  retribution  against U.S. firms. This is very unwise.  goes  against  the  fundamental  notion that what we need in this coun try is more coordination of national in terests and strategies to implement a  trade policy and other domestic poli cies geared  toward economic growth  and prosperity for our people. We will  not be able to accomplish this if we  are being undercut in our own courts.  I will vote against this amendment,  and support  this bill.  I hope  to be  present to cast my vote for this bill  today before I must leave for impor tant business in my congressional dis trict. If I do miss the final vote on this  bill, I have already made provision to  It  ",1983
1624,414,22,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Chairman, like a  bad dream, the domestic content bill  has come back again to haunt us. Ap propriately labeled by many as ""the  most  profoundly  anticonsumer  bill  before  the Congress""  the  legislation  not only violates  international  trade  agreements, it also threatens to seri ously damage our agricultural export  markets. These are markets that we  have worked hard  to  develop,  and  which are vital to the continuation of  our strong economic recovery.  The nation  likely  to be most dra matically affected by this legislation is  Japan. As many  of my  colleagues  know,  Japan  is  the  largest  export  market for U.S. farm products, com prising about 15 percent or our ex ports, at $5.5 billion. Domestic content  legislation would wipe out $5.5 billion  worth of Japanese auto exports. With out being a mathematical whiz, one  can logically assume that the Japanese  retaliation would  equal  our  entire  farm export market.  It seems unfair for us  to ask our  farmers  to bear the consequences of  unnecessary protectionist  legislation.  Furthermore, economic evidence indi cates that the need for  this type of  legislation is more imagined than real.  Recent third quarter figures show a  drastially improved automobile indus try. Profits are way up, and with the  continued economic  recovery  that  is  expected, this positive trend will con tinue.  The Japanese have already signed a  voluntary  agreement  to  limit  their  auto exports to this Nation. Our auto  industry is showing signs of strength  from within. Why, then, is it necesary  to threaten international agreements,  and our agricultural community, with  a bill destined only to produce domes tic discontent.    ",1983
1625,414,22,Mr. KOLTER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 1234,  the  Fair Practices in Automotive Products  Act. This very important bill would es tablish urgently needed domestic con tent requirements for vehicles sold in  the United States.  The auto industry has an enormous  impact on the economy and employ ment in this country. We must have a  vibrant auto industry if we are to have  a true economic recovery. It is estimat ed that we have  lost over 1 million  jobs in the auto and related industries  since the mid-1970's because of foreign  imports  and  the number  is  rising  sharply. The House passed a domestic  content bill last year but the Senate  unfortunately failed to act on it. We  need  this  legislation now more than  ever so let us send a message to the  Senate, the President, and the Ameri can people by voting overwhelmingly  to pass the Fair Practices in Automo tive Products Act.  The steel industry has been particu larly hard hit by the weakened domes tic auto market but  then  the same  could probably be said about the plas tics, rubber, electronics, and glass in dustries. Regardless of the industry we  point to, the results are the same: Un precedented levels of unemployment.  If we continue to allow the industrial  base of this country to erode, we not  only threaten any economic recovery  we may have but also the national se curity of the United States. No great  nation can remain great for very long  without a strong and healthy industri al base.  It is time for us to show the world  that we will no longer allow them total  access to the greatest consumer nation  in the world while they slap us in the  face by  restricting  the products we  want to sell in their country.  The free  trade policy that this ad ministration  espouses  has  cost  us  jobs-hundreds of thousands of them.  While we def end and protect our allies  in the world, they build cars and send  them here. While we spend billions of  dollars on defense, Japan and coun tries in Western Europe spend billions  of dollars subsidizing their auto and  steel industries. While they put their  people to work, we put ours in the un employment  line. While  they  have  growing economies,  in western Penn sylvania we have an economic recovery  that is always around the comer. No  other industrial country who produces  autos allows the amount of foreign im ports that we allow. These countries  have industrial and trade policies that  encourage exports and prohibit  im ports. Italy restricts Japanese imports  to less than 1 percent. France restricts  Japanese imports to 2.5 percent. Great  Britain and West Germany restrict all  foreign  imports  to  11  percent  and  Japan restricts imports to less than 1  percent. Compared  to  these  figures,  the 28 percent of imported cars sold in  the United States almost makes it look  like we are trying to self-destruct our  auto industry. Make no mistake about  it, we need a domestic content bill.  Over 30  industrial countries already  have domestic content  laws on  the  books.  H.R.  1234  simply  states  that  the  more cars a company wants to sell in  the United States the more they are  required to build those cars here. It  seems only  fair  that  if  a  company  wants to take advantage of the largest  automarket in the world, it ought to  put some of the manufacturing in that  market. That  is what would be  required if this bill became law. Oppo nents of the bill claim that this is a  quota bill-reducing competition  by  shutting imports out of our market but actually the bill is an investment  bill that would require that foreign car  companies to put plants here in order  to maintain access to the U.S. market.  This  requirement  would  obviously  help put  some  of  those  1 million  people back to work.  I urge all of my colleagues to join  with me and send a message  to the  world. It is time for a fair trade policy  in  the United States.  It  is  time  to  bring our trade policy in line with re ality and into today's real world. Like  so many of  the other policies, pro grams,  and  ideas  espoused by  this  President, his free trade policy belongs  to a different era.  We owe it to the American people  and to the millions of unemployed to  pass this very important legislation.   e ",1983
1626,414,22,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  I would  like to associate myself fully with the  remarks of the gentleman from New  York and want to commend both him  and the distinguished chairman of the  committee <Mr. DINGELL) for their out standing leadership on this issue. I rise  in strong support of  the  legislation  before us, H.R. 1234.  I have heard  some of our colleagues argue that the  House should not act favorably on this  bill as it is a protectionist piece of leg islation, not in keeping with our free  trade heritage. Let those who bemoan  local content legislation tell us what  alternatives  they propose. We have  certainly heard a great deal of criti cism and doomsday predictions, but  there has been precious little offered  by way of concrete and viable alterna tives.  I would ask those Members to  face  the  180,000  unemployed  auto  workers and the 600,000 people who  remain out of work in the auto suppli er industries and tell them that this is  not the best way to assist the auto in dustry.  The facts are before us. The number  of unemployed Americans has reached  a level that cannot be ignored or even  tolerated  in  the short run by  those  elected  to  represent  the  interests of  our citizens. Even the slight upturn in  recent economic activity has not allevi ated the effects of the recession which  threaten the collapse of many of our  basic  industries. How  can we-how  should we-respond?  I believe that H.R. 1234  is the one  effective tool currently available to en courage those who wish to take advan tage of the American market to invest  here  in our country. Moreover,  this  legislation is significant as an expres sion of the building frustration in the  United States about the gross inequi ties we encounter in the international  trading practices of many of the major  trading nations. It must be made clear  ",1983
1627,466,22,Mr. LENT.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1983
1628,466,22,Mr. FLORIO., I yield to the gentle man from New York.  ,1983
1629,466,22,Mr. LENT.,"  I  thank the gentleman  for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I  rise to  support  the amendment offered by  the gentleman from New Jersey on  behalf of Mr. EDGAR of Pennsylvania  for  the establishment of a National  Ground Water Commission.  I commend the gentleman for this  farsighted amendment which will pro vide a major step toward resolving this  Nation's ground water problems. As  ranking minority member  of  the  House Commerce Subcommittee with  jurisdiction over our Nation's hazard ous waste disposal laws, my interest in  ground water  protection  has  been  longstanding.  In 1979,  I held a hearing in Long  Island specifically to assess the ground  water situation and to find answers to  any  contamination  problems.  Last  year, I supported adoption of a virtual ly  identical amendment  to  the one  being  offered  today. Unfortunately  that RCRA reauthorization measure  was never enacted into law.  Furthermore,  I personally wrote a  letter to the President earlier this year  requesting that the administration es tablish a blue ribbon panel to develop  a  coherent  national  ground water  strategy. Unfortunately my  request  was never acted upon.  The ground water situation is espe cially serious on Long Island, where  my congressional district  is  located,  because  the  2.75 million  residents  there rely entirely on three aquifers  for  their  water  supplies.  These  aquifers hold about 8.3 cubic miles of  water, an amount so vast that it could  cover  the  entire Earth  under  21/2  inches of water. Protected by hun dreds of feet of soil and gravel, Long  Island's ground water was for years  simply considered invulnerable to con tamination by organic chemicals. How ever, during the 1970's, a variety of or ganic  chemicals were  discovered  to  have  penetrated  the  island's water  supplies. Testing during  those years  revealed  that significant contamina tion had touched a number of public  and private well water supplies. This  contamination is attributable to a vari ety of factors including gasoline stor age  tanks,  fertilizer  runoff, sanitary  landfills, and septic tank systems.  Ground water contamination is not  isolated  to  Long  Island  but  has  become a problem of national signifi cance in recent years. While I believe  that the States should ultimately have  the primary responsibility for protect ing ground water, I favor a coordinat ed effort at the national level to deter mine what is needed to prevent fur ther deterioration of our ground water  supplies. The Ground Water Commis sion which  this  amendment  estab lishes will provide such a coordinated  national approach.  The Commission would be charged  with numerous important tasks includ ing assessing current State and Feder al regulation of ground water, assess ing the adequacy of existing ground  water research and assessing the roles  of State, local, and the Federal Gov ernment  in managing ground water  quality. And, most  importantly,  the  Commission will not be empowered to  establish any new regulatory authori ties, but rather will study these issues  and report back to Congress with its  recommendations. Congress will  then  examine the Commission's recommen dations  and make  the  appropriate  policy decisions.  Preservation of  the purity of our  ground water depends on vigilant over sight by public officials who are in a  position  to make policies which will  insure its protection. I am proud to be  here today to lend my support to a Na tional  Ground Water  Commission  which will  provide  us with major  progress toward establishing a compre hensive national ground water protec tion policy.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1983

1632,466,22,Mr. MOLINARI.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Pennsylvania. This measure  is long overdue.  We know that our ground water re sources are threatened with contamiMr. Chairman, I rise  in support of  ",1983
1633,479,22,Mr. LOTT., How long have we been  waiting on regulatory reform legisla tion?  ,1983
1634,479,22,Mr. LEVITAS.," My  recollection  is  about 61/z years now, and in terms of  legislative veto almost 9 years.  If the gentleman would yield  fur ther, I  think the gentleman made a  very important point that I want the  Members of  this body  to  focus on.  What is it that says that some unelect ed bureaucrat at the Environmental  Protection Agency is better able to de termine what laws are imposed upon  the small business people in your com munity than the people in Congress?  Who is accountable around here? We,  the elected Members of Congress, are.  I think that a lot of people just want  to pass the buck to the unelected offi cial so that we do not have to face up  to their responsibilities. And next year  when the small business people come  saying ""Who made this possible,"" then  I think they are going to look at a list  of the people who voted against this  amendment and they will know.  ",1983
1635,479,22,Mr. LOTT.," Again we should empha size to our colleagues, while you have  made this comply with the Chadha re quirements,  I would  like  to ask  the  gentleman  from Georgia how many  times has the Congress passed amend ments  like  this,  even  though  there  have been some changes  to comply  with the requirements of that new de cision by the Supreme Court? I mean,  it has been hundreds of times?  ",1983
1636,479,22,Mr. LEVITAS., This is not the first  time. There have been a number of  provisions  similar  to  this  already  adopted by this Congress.  ,1983
1637,479,22,Mr. MOODY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it is with some hesi tation that I  take the floor to speak  against  this amendment,  since  I  do  have so much respect for the gentle man from Georgia.  It seems as though we are talking at  cross purposes here. The gentleman is  quite right when he says this House  should never give away  its right  to  draw  regulations  to  some unelected  bureaucrat. But the way we maintain  that right I think is the key issue, not  that we should have the right.  Let me just briefly speak from my  experience in the Wisconsin State Leg islature. We tried this sort of thing.  We  carefully  considered what  you  might call a Levitas-type approach but  it fell of its own weight. It meant, in  fact,  everything had  to  be  passed  twice. We would  have  had  to  go  through  a  doubletrack  system  for  every measure  requiring  regulations:  First the bill  itself, then the regula tion.  We came up with a better way, final ly, and that was to give each House a  time certain during which  it could  review-the committees of authority could review specific proposed regula tions. If they interposed no objection,  then  the  regulations would go  into  effect. So each House of the legisla tion had a window of time to react to  those regulations which came to their  attention as being onerous, impossible,  or unwise. Both Houses would have to  act  in order  to suspend and rewrite  regulations.  But neither House was required to  act on each one of  the voluminous  bodies of administrative law, much of  which was fine. That seemed to be for  us in Wisconsin a much better way. It  lightened the load tremendously.  I  can  just  imagine what would  happen to the length of congressional  sessions  if we had  to double  track  every issue twice through both Houses  and through the White House.  But  the more  important point  I  would like to raise with the gentleman  from Georgia, and I hope he will re spond to a question, is this: It seems to  me there is an inherent logical contra diction to what the gentleman is pro posing. If we  take as given  that we  cannot have a one-House veto, and we  agree that once we pass legislation in  both Houses and it is signed at the  White House and becomes the will of  the full Congress, then under the Levi tas approach one House could subse quently on this second track around  thwart the will of the entire Congress  and of the executive branch by simply  ref using to act.  You therefore are back in the box of  a one-House veto. A one-House veto by  inaction.  I would ask  the gentleman  to  re spond to this internal logical contra diction that would be set up by his  proposal.  ",1983
1638,479,22,Mr. LEVITAS., Will  yield?  ,1983
1639,479,22,Mr. MOODY., I yield to the gentle man from Georgia.  ,1983
1640,479,22,Mr. LEVITAS.,"  I  think the gentle man has made the case very well and I  would simply say  I do not disagree  with him because  the  second  time  around, as the gentleman refers to it and this would have the effect of a  one-House veto,  you  are quite  cor rect-but the second time around we  would not be  looking at  the  same  thing we were looking at the first time  around.  Then we would be  looking at the  specific  regulatory  framework  pro posed  to  implement what we have  passed. The purpose of the legislative  review is to ensure that proposed reguthe gentleman  lations are consistent with what the  Congress has passed.  D 1750  And the question I would address to  my very good friend from Wisconsin is  this: Why should you, as an elected  Member of the Congress of the United  States, not make  the decision as  to  whether a particular regulation that  will cost  the American people $100  million goes into effect? Why should  you pass that decision to someone who  has never suffered the inconvenience  of running for public office and is ac countable to nobody except the Office  of Personnel Management and his im mediate  supervisor? A  $100 million  impact, why should not we be involved  in that decision?  ",1983
1641,479,22,Mr. MOODY.," Let me try to respond,  if I could reclaim my time: I agree, we  should be involved in this process. The  question is how.  The huge dollar figure  the gentle man cites is  irrelevant. This issue of  how we assert our authority over ad ministrative regulations is the key. Of  course, we should never give away that  authority and we should always have  the right to review those regulations,  but reviewing it does not require actu ally  passing  it back  through  each  House a second time, as the Levitas  amendment would require. As I say, in  Wisconsin we accomplished the same  goal with far less difficulty by simply  giving each House  the specific  time  limit  in which  to  react  to proposed  regulations. If either House did react,  then it could suspend them until they  were dealt with. Again, there would be  a certain time limit to deal with them,  and both Houses would have to deal  with them. If neither House did react,  did not object, then they would go into  force.  The legislature retained the right to  suspend them. It give no bureaucrat  that right, which is what you fear and  what I fear, but it did not require that  every House  laboriously double-track  every  legislative measure that would  involve regulations.  So I do not disagree one iota with  what the gentleman  is  trying to ac complish. But  I  suggest  that he  is  asking this House to put in countless  needless extra hours of floor action on  regulations.  But, I, again, ask you to respond to  the  internal  illogic of  the point  I  raised earlier: If we agree  that one  House's vetoes are not acceptable, how  would you respond to that point that  your  amendment would  have  the  effect of reinstituting one-House veto.  I think, in fact, the gentleman agreed  with that a moment ago, but he did  not elaborate on why that would ever  be a good thing.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Wisconsin  <Mr. MOODY) has expired.  ",1983
1642,492,22,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, will  gentleman yield?  Mr. AuCOIN. I would be pleased to  yield to my good friend and colleague  from Ohio (Mr. WYLIE).  ",1983
1643,492,22,Mr. WYLIE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I want to associate myself with the  remarks of my very good Democratic  friend. He and I have come up with  what we believe is the best and maybe  the only way to resolve this impasse.  While  I  am saying  it,  I want  to  thank  the gentleman  from Oregon  <Mr. AUCOIN)  for his  initiative and  leadership on  this very  serious and  most important problem.  On October 6, we introduced House  Joint Resolution 382, calling for  the  creation of a National Commission of  Federal Budget Deficit Reductions.  The Commission would consist of 15  members, 5 appointed by  the Presi dent, 5 by the Senate majority leader,  and 5 by the Speaker of the House.  The Commission must report its rec ommendations  to  the President and  Congress within 90 days of enactment  of the resolution, but not later than  February 15, 1984.  Mr. Speaker, $200 billion-plus Feder al deficits, representing 5 to 6 percent  of GNP over the next few years are  taking the U.S. economy into unchart ered waters. Most financial analysts,  the Congress, the administration, and  the general public are frightened by  the risks such unprecedented deficits  pose-crowding out in priviate credit  markets,  inflation, and high  interest  rates.  The stock markets and bond markets  are certainly trying to give us a mes sage. They have been struggling for 5  months now because of the psycholog ical, it not real, damage such deficits  do. The resulting high interest rates  have adverse effects on such key sec tors of the economy as housing, busi ness  investment, consumer durables,  farming, and several other credit-sen sitive areas.

1645,505,22,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, a recent article in the Wash ington Post concerning new  regula tions  from  the Office of Personnel  Management prompted me to write to  OPM's Director, Dr. Donald Devine. I  wanted to assure myself that the new  reduction in force regulations of OPM  would have no adverse effects with re spect to veterans of our Armed Forces.  I was  particularly  concerned  about  those veterans who are disabled.  Dr. Devine's prompt reply was most  reassuring. He is an ardent supporter  of veterans' preference in public em ployment and I was very pleased to re ceive his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I know that this issue  is of great interest to each of my col leagues. I, therefore, herewith submit  for inclusion in the RECORD the article  from the Post, my letter to Dr. Devine,  and his reply:  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 2, 1983]  OPM SAYS NEW RULES WON'T HURT  VETERANS  <By Mike Causey)  The Office of Personnel Management says  that veterans have nothing  to  fear  from  new reduction-in-force rules that become ef fective later this month.  In fact, OPM says that veterans, particu larly disabled veterans, will get added job  protection from new rules that overhaul the  way agencies select employes to be RIFed  out of their jobs.  Patrick Korten, executive assistant direc tor of the OPM, said that yesterday's Diary  ""made  it appear  that our new  rules will  somehow treat veterans differently during a  RIF."" The  column  quoted  congressional  sources who said that a ""wrinkle""  in  the  new OPM regulations would cause veterans  rated ""unacceptable"" by their bosses to lose  special job protection during RIFs.  ""In fact,"" Korten said, ""that has been the  case since the passage of the Civil Service  Reform Act of 1978. The law says very clear ly  that veterans who are rated 'unaccept able' cannot receive the added job protec tion of veterans' preference in a RIF.""  ""In this case it is simply the status quo,""  Korten said, ""with no change in treatment  for veterans during a RIF. But, in another  area, there is a very important improvement  for veterans. That  involves a much broader  definition of competitive areas and competi tive levels during a RIF.""  Korten  said  that  under  the  current  system,  veterans  and  nonveterans  often  must compete for jobs in small groups called  competitive areas. Expanding the size of the  groups will give veterans the advantage of  competing with more nonveterans.  At  the same  time, OPM says  that new  value given to performance under its pro posed rules change will give greater protec tion to employees who do well on the job,  but who have been in government a relative ly short time. Under current rules, short service employees got very little extra credit  for  above-average  job  performance,  and  hence are usually the first fired.  Many of those short-service employees, es pecially in the higher grades, are blacks and  women.  Moe Biller has been reelected president of  the American Postal Workers Union.

1647,544,22,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, on the  occasion of National Drug Education  Week,  I would  like  to point  to  the  many parents across the country who  are constructively addressing the trag edy of drug and alcohol use among our  young people.  Although drug use is not a new prob lem  in  this country,  it has become  frighteningly  epidemic. More  and  more children are experimenting with  drugs and alcohol at a younger and  younger age to the extent that drugs  and alcohol together have become the  leading cause of death among Ameri can  teenagers.  Some  16,000  young  people were killed in a recent year in  alcohol-related traffic fatalities alone;  50 percent of the 5,000  teenage sui cides last year were attributed to alco hol and pills.  A ray of hope in this unfortunate  situation is  that parents around the  country are courageously facing  the  possibility that their own children are  being robbed of a normal and healthy  childhood through the specter of drug  and  alcohol  abuse. At  least  5,000  parent peer groups have been orga nized and are working energetically to  deter  the use of alcohol and drugs  among  their  communities'  young  people.  Hopefully  the  determined  efforts  and  successes  of  these  concerned  parent  groups will  be  built  upon  through their sponsorship of an up coming public television broadcast of  ""The Chemical People,""  a  two-part  series designed to bring parents and  citizens  together  and  off er  them  guidelines for helping young people.  Last night and on November 9, com munities in my district will be among  12,000 communities around the coun try gathering to watch this broadcast.  Program 1 will supply hard inf orma tion about the alcohol and drug abuse  problem and lead to a discussion of  the  local  situation. Program 2 will  focus on how other parents, schools,  and neighbors are fighting drugs and  alcohol and provide the basis for the  establishment of a  community  task  force.  Recently, the director of ""The Gate way"" a comprehensive treatment pro gram for chemically dependent adoles cents, Dr.  Joseph Novello,  testified  before a crisis intervention hearing of  the Select Committee on Children,  Youth, and Families. In his testimony,  Dr. Novello pointed out that:  No one single group or institution is at  ""fault"" <for the epidemic of teenager drug  abuse>: not  the Federal Government, not  parents, not the schools, not the media, not  even psychiatrists-and surely not the teen agers themselves.  He went on to stress, however, that:  If none of us stands alone as the prob lem-we must stand together as the solu tion.  I would like to applaud the dedicat ed individuals in my district and across  the  country who  have  committed  thelilSelves to be part of this solution.  They have  translated  their  love  for  their children into an honest and de termined campaign for  their future.  Their efforts should serve as an inspi ration to involvement for us all.e  ACID RAIN  HON. EDWIN 8. FORSYTHE  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 3, 1983  e ",1983
1648,544,22,Mr. FORSYTHE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues the recent remarks of  John D. Feehan,  chairman of  the  board and president of Atlantic City  Electric Co. I think Mr. Feehan's com ments are worthy of our consideration  as we deal with the issue of acid rain.  His remarks follow:  REMARKS OF JOHN D. FEEHAN  My name is John Feehan and I am Chair man of the Board and President of Atlantic  City Electric Company which  serves  the  electric energy needs of the Southern third  of this State. In recent years I have also  served as President of the New Jersey Utili ty Association, as Chairman of the Board of  the New Jersey State Chamber of Com merce, as Chairman of the New Jersey Cap ital Budgeting and Planning Commission  and as a Director of the Governor's Manage ment Improvement Project. I mention these  other activities to suggest that my remarks  come  from  a  broader  perspective  than  simply that of a utility chief executive.  I want  to commence by wishing you a  ""Happy  Anniversary.""  Ten  years  ago,  almost to this exact date, the Arab Oil Em bargo commenced. That event had a world wide  and  continuing  impact  on  energy  prices and rampant inflation. In New Jersey  we saw a major disruption in energy supply  and a dramatic increase in the cost of all  forms of energy, including electricity. Was  that  event unpredictable-my  answer  to  that is a resounding ""No.""  In 1971  I  testified before this very New  Jersey Clean Air Council when New Jersey  Department of Environmental Protection  was hell-bent on driving the last trace of  coal out of New Jersey by its very stringent  particulate, smoke and S02 regulations. We  warned that we were being forced to use low  sulfur overseas oil. I testified in 1971 as fol lows:  ""In the current fuels crisis, the complete  elimination of a basic fuel source <coal>  is  pure folly and places this State, the East  Coast and the Nation in an extremely vul nerable position."" ""-85 percent of the East  Coast oil comes from foreign sources on for eign  ships under  foreign  flags.

1655,570,22,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in support of my resolution, House  Joint Resolution 383, which designates  the week of November 6,  1983,  as  Florence Crittenton Mission Week.  May I first thank my 228 colleagues  who have kindly cosponsored this res olution. I especially note the support  of our distinguished minority and ma jority  leaders and members of  the  House Post Office and Civil Service  Committee.  This resolution recognizes 100 years  of outstanding public service by the  Florence Crittenton organization.  In  1883, Charles Nelson Crittenton of  New York opened his first rescue mis sion, which offered a new start for  girls in difficulty with family, the law,  pregnant out-of-wedlock, or alone with  child. This service grew out of Mr.  Crittenton's despair over the death of  his  5-year  old  daughter,  Florence,  after whom the organization is named.  This despair be.came a drive to help  the outcast and less fortunate young  girls than his Florence who grew up in  a wealthy family. In the next 15 years,  Crittenton expanded his New York  agency to the west coast. Homes are  now found in 15 States. In 1898, Presi dent McKinley signed  the Mission's  charter. In 1903, Congress acted to in corporate  the  Florence  Crittenton  Mission  in perpetuity. On Tuesday,  November 8, 1983, a recognition dinner  is planned in New Orleans. The 39 na tionwide Crittenton agencies express  their deep appreciation  to the Con gress for this proclamation.  President Reagan has also sent a  congratulatory message to the dinner  gathering which notes ""that your tra dition of service has been maintained  largely  through voluntary donations  of talent and financial support <that)  strengthens one of our most important  American traditions.""  ""Crittenton"" has  become  synony mous with compassion, not condemna tion, for young women with pregnancy  problems or with emotional, social dis orders. Crittenton  agencies off er  a  continuum of services which  include  pregnancy care, after pregnancy care,  and single parent counseling. Also pro vided  is a  temporary home that in cludes  career  counseling. May  the  Florence Crittenton Mission continue  another 100 years.e  The joint resolution was ordered to  be engrossed and read a  third time,  was read the third time, and passed,  and a motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.

1662,570,22,Mr.  BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, for some time, I, and many of  my colleagues, have been warning of  the  ideological blinders and military  to all  bent of U.S. foreign policy. This has  been  especially  evident  in Central  America, where our mounting military  aid to El Salvador and Honduras is evi dent, and our not so secret war against  Nicaragua have escalated conflicts and  undermined the prospects for negotia tions; where our support, in the name  of anti-Communism, for regimes that  ruthlessly suppress their own citizens  makes a mockery of our commitment  to democracy, and drives  those who  seek a measure of self-determination  into a bitter anti-Americanism. Recent  events, however, have convinced me  that the danger inherent in this ad ministration's foreign policy extends  far beyond the imminent prospects of  regional war.  With the invasion of Grenada, the  administration has confirmed  the world that ours is a foreign policy  that places military action ahead of di plomacy, values  the pursuit of  raw  power above the respect for interna tional law, and will stop at little, in cluding  the censorship of our own  press, to enforce its views of the ideo logical war between East and West.  What I  fear most from  this foreign  policy is that the administration has  shown  the capacity  to  remake  the  world in its own image. If the adminis tration insists on drawing a simplistic  line between East and West, between  us and them, and backing that vision  with military force,  then we  indeed  may face a world that is divided on  just those lines.  0 1240  For these reasons, I rise to condemn  the invasion of Grenada. I know it is  popular today in this country, but I  suspect over a period of time that pop ularity will be eroded when the Ameri can people become aware of the facts  that have taken place this past week.  This invasion as unequivocably out side the acceptable standards of inter national behavior and law. It violated  the prohibitions against intervention  in the internal affairs of other states  found in the Charters of the United  Nations  and  the Organization  of  American  States,  and  in  the Rio  Treaty.  The administration cited  as  legal  justification for the invasion a  little  known treaty of the Organization of  East Caribbean States, which was  signed by seven nations-the United  States was not among them-in June  of 1981. It was at the request of some  of  these  nations  that  the United  States acted in what the President has  called ""a military operation to restore  order and democracy in the region.""  Yet, this treaty only provides for a col lective response to defend a member  country from outside attack. Nowhere  does  the  treaty call  for preemptive  measures, by  a  nation outside  the  ",1983
1663,596,22,Mr. STEVENS.," I understand that is  one of the items on our list to consider  once we get through these appropria tions bills,  the Civil Rights Commis sion, the reconciliation bill, the debt  ceiling, the Clark nomination, and pos sibly  the Export Administration Act  before we complete business after we  finish the appropriations bills. We will  be delighted to discuss that.  As far as the time agreement on the  pending measure, I do not believe we  can flesh out the time agreements on  each amendment until we do deter mine what  is going  to be  the final  hour of debate on this bill. We did  that  last year,  if  the Senator will  recall. We got an agreement to vote at  a time certain on a day. We indicated  either Monday afternoon or Tuesday  at 2 p.m. would be acceptable. This is  because of the parameters of dealing  with the House. It has nothing to do  with the time limitation here. We are  prepared to stay in session as long as is  required  today,  Saturday,  come  in  early Monday and early Tuesday. We  are not trying to constrain in any way  the time the Senate spends on the bill.  We want to have assurance we can  get  this bill  to  the House and give  them notice that we shall have it to  the House in time to meet in confer ence Tuesday afternoon before  the  continuing resolution is the subject of  consideration in the House.  ",1983
1664,596,22,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, may I say  to the deputy leader, in my judgment,  it is not possible to get a  time for a  final vote until we find out what the  amendments are. That is unrealistic, I  say most respectfully  to the deputy  leader, to talk in terms of a final vote  at a  final  time until we know what  amendments are going to be called up.  May I say this: We can agree on a  time limit and who knows what kind  of amendment will be called up be cause we shall be forced  to vote,  to  cast a final vote on the bill regardless  of what kind of nongermane amend ment might be called up. So it is just  simply unrealistic-I say that again re spectfully  to the Senator-because I  have tried to help get time agreements  around here.  I  think we have been  pretty cooperative on this side. But we  have to know what amendments are  going to be called up.  ",1983
1665,596,22,Mr. STEVENS.," I might say to my  friend, I share his trepidation in look ing into Pandora's box as far as the de fense bill is concerned. I shall ask our  side to put out a hotline urging Sena tors to notify Defense Committee staff  of any amendments  they  intend  to  enter into. We shall present that list  to the minority leader, and I would be  prepared to enter into a  time agree ment that no amendments not listed  will be in order on this bill. If the mi nority  leader will do  the same, we  ought to be able to have a time agree ment here in a very short time on that  basis. I would be happy to have such a  time agreement.  ",1983
1666,596,22,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, let me say  to  the deputy  leader  that I cannot  assure him as of  this moment of a  time agreement  in any  respect, but  before we can realistically begin to try  to get a  time agreement, which will  have as part of that agreement a date  and hour for a final vote, we have to  know what the amendments are and  attempt to find out from the authors  of them whether or not they would  agree on a particular  time for each  amendment.  We shall attempt to do that on this  side of the aisle. Then we shall get to gether and see what we have and go  from there.  ",1983

1677,596,22,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," I thank my distinguished friend, the senior Senator  from Alaska. I shall not require more  than 21/z minutes.  My statement today is the third of a  series on the subject, ""Limited Export  of Alaska Oil: A $10-Billion Windfall.""  Mr. President, word is going around  that the Federal Treasury will  lose  money as a  result of the export of  Alaska oil. It has been suggested that  shipowners will default on  title XI  loans, the Japanese will force U.S. pro ducers  to sell oil at a discount,  the  State of Alaska will be the major ex porter cutting into windfall profits tax  <WPT> gains; the opponents' litany of  negative revenue impacts goes on and  on. Fortunately for the Federal Gov ernment, none of that is true.  Limited export of up to 200,000 bar rels per day of Alaska crude oil and  unlimited export of new field produc tion, shipped on American-flag tank ers, will yield a  substantial net  in crease in Federal revenues.  There are  two ways Federal reve nues will  be  increased  by  export:  higher WPT on Prudhoe Bay produc tion which  is  exported and higher  OCS bonus sale and royalty payments  on new Alaska fields developed as a  result of export.  Assuming  that 200,000 barrels per  day of Prudhoe Bay production is ex ported, of which 50,000 barrels per day  is State  royalty crude,  the Federal  Government will realize an additional  $2.43 a barrel in income tax and wind fall profits taxes. That adds up to $133  million a year in additional tax reve nues. And,  in the battle against the  deficit, every $100 million counts im measurably.  In addition, the Federal Government  owns most of the attractive new areas  for future Alaska and west coast devel opment-most of which are offshore.  The Department of Energy has con cluded that:        the value of future OCS and Federal  land leases in Alaska and California would  increase, resulting in larger bonus bids       and production  royalties. Revenues  from  those leases over the productive lives of the  fields would result in gains of about $10 bil lion (discounted present value> if the ban  were lifted.  That is from the testimony of Jan  Mares, Acting Director of the Office  of  Policy,  Planning  and Analysis,  DOE, before the Senate Committee on  Foreign Relations Subcommittee on  East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  Mr. President, have we become so  jaded to $200 billion deficits that we  can lightly dismiss the opportunity of  an additional $10 billion  in Federal  revenues?  I suggest, therefore, that before we  continue  to  provide  this  enormous  hidden subsidy to the domestic mari time industry, we determine if there is  a cheaper way  to achieve  the valid  public policy objective of a modern,  competitive merchant marine. As  I  represent a state which relies on do mestic shipping, I would be happy to  work with others to work on this prob lem. But it is  time  to stop creating  countless other energy security and  foreign policy problems by using the  export ban as a band-aid.  Mr. President, at this point, I ask  unanimous consent that a copy of the  Department of Energy testimony on  oil exports before the East Asian and  Pacific Affairs Subcommittee be print ed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  ",1983
1678,609,22,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, no where could there be a more graphic  demonstration of the administration's  refusal to count defense dollars as con tributors to the deficit. Here in black  and white we have Mr. Stockman ig noring the plain arithmetical fact that  if you save $14.7 billion in one area,  and spend $3.5 billion in another, you  wind up $11.2 billion to the good as far  as the deficit goes. He does not see it  that way, apparently. Anyone else who  can add and subtract can.  RHODE  ISLAND'S BURDEN OF  GRIEF  FROM  THE  LEBANON  BOMBING  ",1983
1679,609,22,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, the deaths  of U.S. marines  in  the bombing of  their headquarters in Lebanon is a na tional tragedy that has angered and  11-059 <>-87-20 (Pt. 22)  saddened all Americans. As a nation  we grieve; we wish it were not so; and  we  look for answers and assurances  that  such  a  thing will  not  again  happen.  But our national anguish is as noth ing when we consider  the personal  grief and sorrow visited upon the fami lies and friends of those young Ameri cans whose  lives were  taken  from  them in Beirut, far from their homes.  In the State of Rhode Island, the  Lebanon bombing has taken a particu larly heavy toll. Nine young Rhode Is landers died in the explosion at the  Marine  barracks  and  headquarters.  Through circumstance and unpredict able  fate,  that  is more  than eight  times as many fatalities as might have  been expected based on the population  of our small State.  There apparently is no one reason  that  explains why  such  a  heavy  burden of grief has fallen on the State  of Rhode Island. It has been suggested  that because the Marines in Lebanon  came from an east coast base, they are  primarily from Eastern States. In ad dition, Rhode Island has a  long and  strong  tradition of military  service,  linked to the proud presence in our  State of major Navy bases.  Whatever  the  reasons, during  the  past week we have  seen  in Rhode  Island a series of military funerals in  an atmosphere of respect and sorrow  which we have not known since the  days past when our armed services suf fered heavy losses in the conflicts in  Vietnam and Korea.  Because Rhode Island is small State,  both in area and population, there is a  special sense of sharing, community  and brotherhood among its people. We  tend to share each others joys and ac complishments, hopes and fears, sad ness and heartbreaks. In this past 2  weeks we  shared  in  the  desperate  worry and anxiety as word was await ed on the fate of our young men, and  in the sorrow when the worst of news  arrived.  I have spoken with the families-the  mothers and fathers and wives-of the  young Rhode Islanders who died  in  Lebanon in the service of our Nation.  and I have been moved not only be  their grief and sorrow, but also by  their courage, their resolve and their  faith.  Mr. President, I  take this occasion  now  to  pay  tribute  to  the  young  Rhode  Island members of  the U.S.  Marine Corps who died in service of  our Nation in Lebanon:  Lance Cpl. Rick R. Crudale, age 21,  of West Warwick, husband of Heidi  Crudale and son of Marie Crudale.  Cpl. Timothy Giblin,  age  20,  of  North Providence, husband of Valerie  Giblin, father of Tiffany Giblin and  son of Jeanne Giblin.  Lance Cpl. Edward S. Iacovino, Jr.,  age 20, of Warwick, son of Elizabeth  and Edward S. Iacovino, Sr.  Pvt. Thomas Julian, age 22, of Ports mouth, son of Joyce and Karl Julian.  Cpl. David Massa, age 21, of Warren,  son of Christine and Manuel Massa.  Lance Cpl. Thomas Shipp, age 27, of  Woonsocket,  husband  of  Pauline  Shipp and son of Theresa and David  Desjardins.  Lance Cpl. James Silvia, age 20, of  Middletown, son of Mrs. Patricia Far rell and Joseph Silvia.  Cpl. Edward Soares, Jr., age 20, of  Tiverton,  son of Lorraine Albernaz  and fiance of Lisa Jusseaueme.  Lance Cpl. Stephen Spencer, age 23,  husband of Lynne Spencer of Ports mouth.  May they rest in peace and may the  memory of these fine young men rest  forever in our hearts.  CONCLUSION OF MORNING  BUSINESS  ",1983

1688,635,22,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, I did  not have this amendinent called to my  special attention during the markup of  this bill. We have some ins and outs  there that are necessary.  I commend the Senator from New  Mexico, and I hope he follows up on  his interest and his efforts to encour age this basic research and reaching  out to let the services reach out into  institutions that are in the business.  At the same time, there is a lot in  what  the Senator from Alaska says  here. We are going to have to try to  have a real conference on this bill, and  there Will be in conference the differ ence between the total amount here  that he refers to and the amount that  we have put in the bill. For my part,  and I am expecting to be one of the  conferees, I will certainly promise to  give this further consideration at that  time.  But I believe  in keeping with this  handling of the bill generally now it  would be best to leave this the way the  committee has it at that figure with  the promise, and  the Senator from  Alaska has made the same promise,  that it actually will be in conference  and we will seek further  facts and  listen to the House side and see what  can be done.  This is a basic sound purpose. The  amendment  can well  apply,  and  I  think though that should be my posi tion.  Again I hope that the Senator will  follow up his interest and attention to  this kind of research.  I got  into some of this myself in  other fields when I  first came here,  and we are growing a  few more and  better pine trees than we were before  that research was done many years  ago, to give one illustration.  So I will support the committee's po sition on all the facts now, but I will  reconsider it in the conference.  ",1983
1689,635,22,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, if I  can  just  respond  to  the comments  made, I appreciate very much the com ments of both the manager of the bill  and the senior Senator from Mississip pi. I would make a distinction, though.  I think it is a crucial distinction in the  bill and in practice. That is the distinc tion between general research and de velopment, which is being funded in  this bill at a very substantial level and  does involve an increase of nearly 13  percent overall for research and devel opment. But I would distinguish be tween that and basic research which is  done primarily through our universi ties, and I think the distinction is im portant. The basic research account  that I am here talking about would be  rising at a  level of 4 percent, if this  amendment were adopted, not the 13  percent. The 13 percent would apply  to  the general category of research  and development.  I would say that the general catego ry of  research and development  is  much more oriented toward applica tion, application to weapons systems,  application which  is of a short-term  nature. What I am trying to do here is  to put a little more balance in it and  see to it that we put something in this  budget,  some  reasonable amount  in  this budget, for the long-term research  that we are going  to be dependent  upon 5 years, 10 years, 15 years from  now for our continued leadership in  many of these areas. I  think that is  crucial and I think that to too much of  an extent we are, as they say, living  ""off the shelf"" in the sense that we  are not adequately funding the basic  research component of this budget.  So all I am asking here is that the  Senate agree in this bill to the same  level of funding that the administra tion  requested,  that the Senate au thorizing  committee  approved,  that  the House authorizing committee ap proved, and that the House Appropria tions Committee approved, and  the  House in general approved in their de fense appropriations bill.  I think to do less than the 4 percent  would not be adequate to our purpose.  Perhaps instead of calling for  the  yeas and nays here, Mr. President, if I  could have the assurance of the two  managers of this bill that this item  will be given positive consideration  and that the need to accede  to the  House position will be adequately con sidered on this item in a conference,  then I might be disposed to withdraw  the amendment.  I gather from  the- Senator from Alaska that he would be  inclined to go with the higher figure   the conference indicated that was the  course to go, and I would like some  ",1983

1691,648,22,Mr. HELMS.," Gladly, Mr. President.  ",1983
1692,648,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Idaho is recognized.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr.  President,  I  have been in the forefront of the op position to the 1979 SALT II Treaty,  which is unequal and therefore incon sistent with U.S.  law. In accordance  with another law, I also led a success ful Senate effort in September 1977 to  prevent President Carter's extended or  prolonged  compliance with  the  ex pired SALT I interim offensive agree ment  from hindering U.S.  strategic  modernization  programs. There  re main significant constitutional, legal,  national security, and political prob lems with prolonged U.S. unilateral  compliance with the SALT II Treaty,  which has not received the advice and  consent of the Senate for Presidential  ratification.  Since June 18, 1979, when SALT II  was  signed, both  the U.S.  and  the  U.S.S.R. have been obligated under  traditional  international  law  to  do  nothing which would def eat the object  and purpose of the SALT II Treaty  still unratified on both  sides. U.S.  policy under both President Carter  and President Reagan has been that  the United States would do nothing to  undercut SALT II, as long as the Sovi ets show equal restraint. The United  States is complying precisely with all  the provisions of the unratified SALT  II Treaty, according to the Secretary  of State's testimony and to recently  declassified Defense Department di rectives. Therefore,  the whole world  should  recognize  that  the United  States is complying with SALT II. The  Senate also has a right and an obliga tion to determine whether the Soviets  are meeting the stated U.S. criteria for  that policy, that is, that the Soviets  show equal restraint and do nothing to  defeat the object and purpose or to  undercut SALT II. Under any  inter pretation of Soviet obligations under  SALT II, a Soviet violation of a funda mental provision of SALT II constrain ing new type ICBM's would both un dercut and def eat the object and pur pose of SALT II, and cannot be re garded as restraint.  Mr. President, the SALT II Treaty is  unequal, unbalanced, and destabiliz ing. It is fatally flawed. The Senate  Armed Services Committee has deter mined that the SALT II Treaty is not  in the national security interest of the  United States. There are at least eight  fatal  flaws of  the SALT II Treaty,  which include these four as the most  important fatal flaws of SALT II:  First, the Soviet monopoly on very  heavy ICBM's, giving them 326 SS-18  very heavy ICBM's to zero allowed for  the United States, making SALT II  fundamentally unequal  in  the most  significant  strategic  capability-very  heavy  ICBM's deployment of which  are  legally  denied  to  the United  States.  Second, allowing the Soviet Backfire  bomber, which has  intercontinental  range and refueling capability, to be  uncounted in SALT II, when Soviet  Bison  bombers with  shorter  range  than the Backfire and scrapped U.S.  B-52 bombers are counted in SALT II.  This is another fundamental inequal ity of SALT II contrary to the Jackson  that  amendment  legal  requirement  there be equality in SALT II.  Third,  the  fact  that  the Soviet  ICBM counterforce capability would  legally be allowed to grow massively  under SALT II, through Soviet deploy ment  of  new  ICBM's carrying  in creased numbers of warheads.  Fourth, the fact that from 1,000 to  2,000  stockpiled  ICBM's  capable of  rapid  reload and  refire, covert soft  launch, and mobile  launch are com pletely unconstrained by the SALT II  Treaty, thereby circumventing or vio lating all of the SALT II delivery vehi cle ceilings: 2,400, 2,250, 1,320, 1,200,  and 820. Here again the U.S. legal ob jective of  equality  in SALT  II  is  denied.  Mr. President, for all of these rea sons I oppose continued U.S. compli ance with  the unratified SALT  II  Treaty. There  is a  strong argument  that the prolonged Senate inaction on  the SALT II Treaty, together with the  initiation in 1982 of strategic arms re duction talks with the Soviets, provide  constructive, de  facto evidence of a  U.S intention not to ratify the SALT  II Treaty.  Mr. President, I would like to pro vide the constitutional arguments for  my amendment.  I  believe  that  the  United States should no longer comply  with the SALT II Treaty unless the  Senate gives its advice and consent for  the President to ratify the SALT II  Treaty in accordance with the treaty making provision of the Constitution.  It is simply not proper for the United  States to comply with a treaty which  is unratified. Moreover, it is improper  for the United States to constrain its  strategic  forces  in order  to comply  with an unratified treaty. There are  dangers  to our national security  in  such extraconstitutional compliance.  Only  two  legal methods exist  for  U.S. compliance with an arms control  treaty: The treatymaking provision of  the Constitution must be exercised or  in the case of an Executive agreement  on arms control, there must be further  affirmative legislation enacted by the  Congress. Section 33 of the 1961 Arms  Control and Disarmament Act speci fies these two methods for constrain ing U.S. military forces to comply with  an arms control treaty or an Executive  agreement.  Now, Mr. President, several aspects  of my amendment deserve comment in  light of these constitutional and legal  facts. In regard to the deactivation of  292 U.S. missiles and bombers counted  in SALT II, I am aware of no further  affirmative  legislation which  either  authorizes or appropriates funds spe cifically for the deactivation of these  SALT II constrained forces. It is my  understanding that general operations  and maintenence funds of the Defense  Department are being used to achieve  these deactivations, and these funds  ",1983
1693,661,22,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, today  I  am  introducing  the ""Health Care  Cost Containment Act of 1983."" This  legislation  is  designed  to  confront  what has become a national crisis-the  disappearance  of  affordable  health  care in the United States.  By any statistical measure, health  care costs are sharply on the rise, far  outstripping the ability of most Ameri cans to pay for it. Last year the health  care  component  of  the Consumer  Price Index rose by 12.1 percent, more  than twice the national inflation rate.  A semiprivate hospital room in a big  city now costs an average of almost  $300 a day, an increase of 160 percent  since 1976.  Unchecked by market forces or regu lation,  escalating health  care  costs  burden consumers in several punishing  guises. There are higher  taxes  for  medicare and medicaid. Health insur ance  premiums  steadily  rise with  annual  increases  of  30  percent or  more. And aggregate higher health  care costs ultimately fuel inflation at  the expense of the quality of life of all  Americans.  Health care is not a luxury. It is a  basic necessity of life that cannot be  allowed to slip inexorably out of the  financial reach of American families.  The Health Care Cost Containment  Act of 1983 offers a useful step in con trolling these costs.  Essentially, the legislation provides  a  limited antitrust exemption to ac complish two results. First, it would  allow health care insurers to collabo rate in collecting health care data on  the costs and quality of care rendered  by health care providers such as hospi tals and clinics. This information base  would promote better informed con sumer choices on health care while  spurring competition among the pro viders of such care. Second. it would  allow  insurers  to enter  into  agree ments with providers clearly stipulat ing the level and cost of health care,  thereby promoting competition with  the health care  industry and giving  further clarity to consumer decisions  on how to choose health care most ef ficiently.  This legislation recognizes that it is  the health care insurers, or so-called  third-party  payors  of  health  care  costs, that are in a good position to re strain costs. Consumers lack enough  information under the present system.  A limited antitrust exemption will give  insurers a mechanism to more accu rately assess costs so that they may in telligently deal with health care pro viders to the benefit of all consumers.  In order to insure that this exemp tion  only  promotes  joint  activities  which help contain costs, the bill au thorizes the Attorney General to in vestigate all the joint conduct provid ed hereunder. If the Attorney General  determines that the joint activity fails  to contain costs or unduly  restricts  competition, the bill provides that the  Attorney General shall order the ces sation of such activities. This investi gatory and remedial power would ef fectively deter potential abuses of the  limited antitrust exemption  the bill  provides.  The exemption is designed to over ride any conflicting State law which  would prevent health care payors from  performing the bill's designated activi ties. It is not intended to supersede  State hospital cost control statutes or  insurance laws which do not conflict  with the bill's purpose, but which may  impose additional duties or responsi bilities on payors or providers.  The magnitude of the health care  cost control problem compels Govern ment and private business to take un usual steps to reach solutions. Anti trust exemptions are not suggested  lightly. But in order to control costs  and  to  promote  competition,  this  narrow exemption appears to be war ranted.  Since  the Federal  antitrust  laws  have been enacted, they have been of  enormous benefit to our Nation in pro moting competition. As a variety of  economic problems have arisen, it has  been appropriate  to  restructure  the  application of these antitrust laws in  the interest of clarifying those laws to  promote the national interest.  This legislation will provide a start ing point to consider the wisdom of  these proposed modifications. It may  be that hearings and further consider ation  prove  these  proposals  unwise or subject to modification, but  the problems are so serious that we  shall consider the manner of dealing  with these problems.  This legislation is not a panacea to  the problem of exploding health care  costs, but it offers a suggestion toward  cost containment, a problem deserving  our urgent attention. I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be reprinted in  the RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  will  s. 2051  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United  States of  America in Congress assembled.

1694,700,22,Mr.  JONES  of  Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  take  this opportunity  to  once again bring to the attention of  my colleagues the serious nature of  the administrative problems now being  brought to light with regard to the Ag riculture Department's  payment-in kind program.  The current issue of the Delta Farm  Press carries a headline article which  very well states in detail the seemingly  endless number of f oulups which have  been committed by the USDA in its  feeble attempt to carry out the PIK  program.  In my opinion, the Reagan adminis tration made a serious mistake in by passing the Congress when it was for mulating  its policies and procedures  for the PIK program. This is especial ly unforgivable now that we learn the  PIK program is going to cost Ameri can taxpayers an unbelievable $11  to  $12 billion. I hope we have all learned  a lesson from the failures of PIK, and  that is, that the Department of Agri culture and the Congress and the agri cultural community must do a better  job of coordinating our efforts as we  begin to build a farm policy which will  carry us through the remainder of the  eighties.  I  applaud  the Delta Farm  Press for having the courage to exam ine the PIK program and speak out on  just what a disaster it has been. I rec ommend  the article  to all my col leagues, and request that it be printed  following my remarks.  [From the Delta Farm Press, Oct. 28, 19831  PIK DELIVERY FOULED UP BY REAGAN PEOPLE  Nobody ever said that the ""shoot from the  hip"" PIK program would be easy to carry  out, but the monumental task of getting the  commodities to farmers is obviously proving  to be more than the Reagan Administration  can handle.  Although Argriculture Department offi cials has more than six months to prepare  November 4, 1983  for the distribution of payment-in-kind, this  is the situation to date:  A large number of rice growers still have  not received certificates of entitlement for  ""crop swap"" that were due in August and  September.  LONG DISTANCE STORAGE  Many of those who have been waiting for  several weeks for payment on PIK rice that  is stored hundreds of miles away-much of  it in California-rather than in nearby ele vators as promised.  Farmers in the Midwest and parts of the  Southeast are being given com of a substan tially lower grade and quality than listed on  their Commodity Credit Corporation Form  477-1, PIK entitlement.  Most of the producers in the mid-section  of the Cotton Belt will be at least a month  late in receiving their PIK because of diffi culties  stemming  from  the government's  controversial Plant-for-PIK program.  The lengthy delays are costing farmers  millions of dollars in interest and carrying  charges on loans they had planned to pay  off on their PIK delivery dates.  BANKERS QUESTIONING  ""We had set up several of our notes to  come due in August,"" said Larry LeJeune, a  rice and soybean farmer in Elton, La.  ""We even made them for August 15 rather  than August 1 <the entitlement date for  PIK rice in south Louisiana> in case of a  slight for delay. Boy, that was a laugh.''  LeJeune had farms with four Agricultural  Stabilization  and  Conservation  Service  serial numbers signed up in the rice PIK.  The situation on the first was relatively  simple. The rice was stored in a local eleva tor and he said the certificate of entitle ment shortly after receiving it on Septem ber 18.  NO CERTIFICATE  162  On the last, the farmer knows he is due  1,107 barrels of rice that are stored in an el evator  in California.  <A  barrel  is  pounds.) But he had not received the certifi cate of entitlement for it as of October 21.  Part of the reason for the lengthy delays,  for LeJeune and others has been the diffi culty  the Commodity Credit Corporation  has had in getting a handle on rice supplies  available for crop swap.  Although  signup  for  the program was  completed last March 11, it was obvious that  as late as August USDA officials still did not  know how much rice was due farmers or  how much they had in investory.  In July, ASCS staff members were telling  growers  in Louisiana and Mississippi that  shortages of PIK rice in their area would be  made up with Arkansas long grain rice.  RICE SHUFFLE  <Texas producers already had been  in formed that much of their payment-in-kind  would have  to come  from medium grain  stocks in California.>  A few weeks later, however, ASCS officials  learned they didn't have enough Arkansas  rice for growers in other Mid-South states.  They announced a drawing would be held to  determine which farmers would be required  to take medium grain rice from California.  That was the first drawing. Then ASCS  discovered additional rice in transit and a  second was held. And then a third.  ""What gets me is that from April on, they  knew  they had  to get  their  inventory  in  shape for distributing the payment-in-kind,""  said LeJeune. ""But as best we can tell they  didn't start doing anything about it until  July.""  ",1983
1695,713,22,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker, on Septem ber 29 and November 1, 1983, the Sub committee on Labor-Management Re lations held hearings on issues of pen sion equity for women.  The private pension system  is  in tended to deliver benefits to supple ment those provided by the social se curity system. Tragically, unforeseen  faults  in the fundamental design of  both retirement systems stand in the  way of meeting our national goal-to  insure the well-being of our elderly.  The private pension system, like the  social security system, generally  re wards a certain kind of work behav ior-that is, a lifetime of steady work  and high earnings. Women's work pat terns do not conform to this model.  According  to  statistics,  a woman  is  likely to work inside the home as well  as outside it at different times in her  lifetime. When in paid employment,  she is likely to be in part-time work  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and segregated into low-paying service  fields that are tolerant of departure  and reentry. Given  this  trend,  it  is  rare that women earn pension benefits  in their own right. Only 19 percent do.  Older women are suffering dire eco nomic hardships. In 1981, the median  total money income of women over 65  was $4,757, a sum hardly adequate to  meet  their  housing  and  long-term  health-care needs;  they are now 72  percent of the elderly who live in pov erty.  For most women, the only hope of  supplementing their social security de pendent's benefit is in claiming a joint  share  of  their  husband's pension.  These women face serious vulnerabili ties as a result of current pension law.  Presently, a woman may be denied  rights to pension benefits with the dis solution of a marriage by death or di vorce regardless of how many years  she served as an economic partner to a  man covered by a plan. Her joint and  survivor annuity could be signed away  by her husband without her knowl edge or consent.  Many witnesses testified as to these  and other serious inadequacies of cur rent law. On November 1, the subcom mittee adopted a bipartisan substitute  for H.R. 2100, a bill introduced by our  colleague, GERALDINE FERRARO.  I want to commend her and our col leagues MARGE ROUKEMA, CARDISS COL LINS, OLYMPIA SNOWE, PAT SCHROEDER,  CLAUDINE  SCHNEIDER,  and  the many  others who have initiated and skillful ly advanced this bill.  On November 2,  I  joined with the  ranking member of the subcommittee,  MARGE ROUKEMA, JOHN ERLENBORN, the  ranking member of the Education and  Labor Committee, GERALDINE FERRARO,  all the members of the Subcommittee  on Labor-Management Relations and  many others to introduce as a new bill,  the bill the subcommittee adopted ear lier this week. We anticipate speedy  enactment of this legislation. A sum mary of the bill follows:  I. MINIMUM AGE OF PARTICIPATION  Will lower the minimum age of participa tion from age 25  to 21; in addition defined  benefit plans would be permitted an option  to continue to provide for ""participation"" at  age  25,  but benefit accrual and vesting  would be required to be credited at age 25  for service as  if actual plan participation  had commenced at age 21.  II. VESTING  The minimum age for vesting would be  lowered from age 22 to age 18. In addition  non-top-heavy plans would be given greater  certainty with respect to the adoption of  vesting provided  in  connection with  the  ""non-discrimination"" provisions of the In ternal Revenue Code by providing safe har bors under Section 41l(d)(l)(B)  (100% 5  year vesting, 10% graded vesting beginning  at 30% after 3 years, and plans meeting cer tain present-value and cross-section  tests>.  This latter provision, similar to that con tained  in  legislation  sponsored by Reps.  Frenzel, Erlenborn and Perkins would be  made inapplicable to top-heavy plans, but  31085  would provide greater certainty for all other  plans with respect to tax qualifications.  III. NO BREAK IN SERVICE FOR MATERNITY/  PATERNITY ABSENCES  1. The maternity /paternity break-in-serv ice rules would provide credit for participa tion and vesting, but only for purposes of  avoiding breaks-in-service.  2. The provision in S. 1978 eliminating the  rule-of-parity  for breaks-in-service of  less  than 5 years is included.  IV. JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITIES FOR  MARRIED PARTICIPANTS  1. An automatic joint and survivor annuity  would have to be made available after 10  years of service rather than after age 45 and  10 years of service as under S. 1978.  2. Defined benefit pension plans <includ ing money purchase plans) would be  re quired to provide annuities, and therefore  joint and survivor annuity for married par ticipants; other  individual  account plans  <e.g. profit sharing and stock bonus plans>  would be exempt from annuity requirement  if the participant's account balance is pay able in full on the death of the participant.  3. Generally the provisions of S. 1978 are  followed with respect to the spousal consent  and  ""election out""  requirements,  except  that the 1-year marriage rule and the 2-year  non-accidental death rule would be deleted.  4. Since the present value of the spousal  benefit in many instances will be small, and  likely to be cashed out, a provision is includ ed which would require the plan to make a  lump sum payment directly to the IRA or  pension plan of the employee's new employ er <if allowed) as the participant may direct.  The participant may also elect cash.  5. Similar to H.R. 2100, deferred vested  participants would be given an option  to  elect a Joint and Survivor Annuity to the  extent that benefit payments have not com menced.  V. DOMESTIC RELATIONS LAW ORDERS-EXCEP TION TO ERISA ANTIALIENATION PROVISIONS  1. Generally the procedures under S. 1978  are followed except that in the case of nonqualified domestic relations orders and cases  in which former spouses cannot be located  payments could be made to participant and  alternate payee's benefits would be held by  plan for up  to 3 years <after which pay ments to alternate payee would be prospec tive only).  2. The amendment clarifies that the quali fied domestic relations       VI. TAX TREATMENT OF SURVIVOR DISTRIBUTION  In addition to the S. 1978 provision per mitting the spouse to roll-over a distribution  to an IRA, as under H.R. 4032 the spouse  could  claim  ten-year  forward  averaging  income tax treatment.  VII. CASH OUT LIMIT  As in S. 1978, the cash out limit is raise  from  $1,750  to  $3,500,  except  that  the  present value is determined using the plans  actuarial valuation rate of interest.e  ",1983
1696,726,22,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of H.R. 4194, a bill  which would extend until June 30,  1985, the antitrust immunities for oil  companies participating in voluntary  agreements  to carry out the energy  programs of the International Energy  Agency <IEA>. The existing antitrust  exemption provision is included in the  Energy Policy and Conservation Act  <EPCA). While most of the authorities  of EPCA expire on June 30, 1985, the  IEA provisions are now scheduled to  expire on December 31, 1983.  H.R. 4194 was reported by the Fossil  and Synthetic Fuels Subcommittee on  October 27 and the full Energy and  Commerce Committee on November 1  by voice vote. My support for H.R.  4194 is predicated on its remaining a  clean bill. I have no objection at this  time to a simple extension of the IEA  authorities up to June 30, 1985,  the  same date as the underlying law ex pires.

1704,726,22,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker  I  yield myself such time as I may c'on sume.  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to  consider  legislation  to honor Danny  Thomas by the presentation of a con gressional gold medal in recognition of  his  humanitarian  efforts  and  out standing work as an American.  Danny Thomas was  born Amos  Jacobs in Deerfield, Mich. For half a  century, he has delighted audiences  with  his  stories,  songs,  and  comic  talent. But there  is another side  to  Danny Thomas.  It  is  the Danny  Thomas who gives of himself, continu ously and selflessly.  Shortly after his marriage in 1936,  Danny Thomas lost his job. Because  times were  difficult  and work was  scarce, he considered giving up show  business. But being a devoutly  reli gious man, he prayed to St. Jude, the  patron saint of the hopeless. With his  prayer sent a promise, ""Help me, and I  will build you a shrine where the poor,  the helpless, and  the hopeless may  come for comfort and aid."" The follow ing day he was offered a job in Chica go, which proved  to be the  turning  point in his career.  From Chicago's 5100 Club Danny  Thomas' career skyrocketed. He was a  success in the New York clubs and in  Hollywood,  and  finally  came  to be  known as one of America's most be loved  television comedians. His long running television series about a show  business father trying to find time for  his family was a situation which par alleled his own domestic life.  But through all of his success, he  never forgot his prayer and his vow to  God. In 1958 Danny Thomas broke  ground for St. Jude's Children's Re search Hospital  in Memphis, Tenn.,  and in 1962 the doors were opened to  ",1983

There  are those who say this is a handout  from the taxpayers, and that is not so.  Seventy percent of the cost of the di version program will be borne by the  dairy farmers themselves; the other 30  percent will be made up in savings.  Mr. Chairman, I ask the Members of  this body to support the compromise,  reject the Conable approach, and give  the dairy farmers a program that will  assist  them in reducing surplus pro duction while being able  to stay  in  business.

1708,739,22,Mr. OLIN., I yield to the gentleman  from Puerto Rico.  ,1983
1709,739,22,Mr. CORRADA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of H.R. 4196, the Dairy  Production Stabilization Act of 1983,  legislation directed at the program of  U.S. surplus production of milk and in  alleviating the high cost of the nation al dairy price support program.  This bill is the result of many long  and diligent hours of hearings, negoti ations with the administration and the  U.S. Department of Agriculture and  with dairy associations. I wish to com mend the chairman of the House Agri culture  Committee,  Congressman  KIKA DE LA GARZA and the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy,  and  Poultry,  Congressman  ToM  HARKIN,  and  the  ranking minority  member of that subcommittee, Con gressman JAMES JEFFORDS, for their pa tience and forbearance in shaping this  legislation.  With  the continued expansion of  milk production in the country, pro gram costs for the dairy price support  program escalated.  In an effort  to  meet  these program costs, Congress  passed provisions in title I of the Om nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  1982 which allowed the U.S. Secretary  of Agriculture to impose two 50 cent  per hundredweight deductions on all  commercial marketings of milk until  purchases by the Commodity Credit  Corporation <CCC> declined to speci fied levels.  I mention this provision since, from  the time of its inception and applica tion, Puerto Rico has continually and  forcefully argued that this assessment  has no commonsense reason to be in  force in Puerto Rico, or the noncontig uous States and territories. This ex emption should affect only those milk  markets about  to ship their surplus  milk to the CCC.  I am pleased to note that both the  House Committee on Agriculture bill  along with its Senate counterpart have  provisions that recognize the validity  of the grievances from Puerto Rico,  the other territories and the States of  Alaska and Hawaii as far as applica tion of this assessment is concerned.  The original assessment, in the case  of Puerto Rico, has resulted  in the  fact that Puerto Rico dairy farmers  have paid $2,228,090.90 into the non reimbursable fund. We are providing in  this bill an exemption from an assess ment that should not apply in isolated  milk markets as exist in the case of  Puerto Rico.  Mr. Chairman, the legislation before  us is a complicated piece of legislation.  When eventually passed, it will hope fully help dairy farmers on the main land United States and in Puerto Rico.  It will  help  the mainland United  States by resolving an extremely com plicated agricultural situation which  other countries throughout the world  do not enjoy, that of solving a problem  of abundance rather than scarcity.  In the case of Puerto Rico, exemp tion from the 50-cent assessment, how ever, will help our island by reducing  the price of milk by approximately 1  cent per quart.  Our  local  industry has never sold  any of its dairy surplus to the CCC. It  has never affected the economics of  the dairy industry on the U.S. main land, and it has a vitality of its own de spite the need to  import grain feed  and the lower yield per cow due  to  tropical weather.  Since we have a wholly separate and  distinct market from the U.S. main land market, I am most pleased that  the Committee  on Agriculture,  in  shaping  this  legislation, has  recog nized our need for exemption from the  assessment program.  Resident  Commissioner  from  Puerto Rico, I urge speedy passage of  H.R. 4196.  ",1983
1710,739,22,Mr. OLIN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of passing a dairy bill that will  represent a dairy program that will  reduce  present  surpluses  and  keep  them down.  The present scheme of charging $1  for every hundred pounds of milk pro duced is not working. The basic prob lem is that the price-support level of  $13.10 is too high. Most farmers can  make good money selling surplus milk  to the Government at that price. Even  with paying  the dollar  assessment,  most farmers can still make money at  the $13.10 support price, and that is  the problem.  History shows that if we lower the  support price, production goes down  and  the consumer also benefits by  lower milk prices.  The bill we pass needs to have in it  sufficient flexibility to adjust the sup port price and let this process work.  Obviously, one of  the major  issues  here is also whether or not to use the  paid diversion program to reduce the  As  surpluses faster, using an assessment  in the meantime to help pay the bill  for the diversion program. This idea  has really  two or three very funda mental flaws.  First of all,  it  takes money away  from those who are not producing the  surplus and pays it to those who are  producing  the surplus. That is emi nently unfair.  Further, there is no guarantee that  production will  stay  down.  After  paying a very fancy diversion price, it  is very questionable whether, after 15  months, farmers will not be able to im mediately increase production, and we  will be right back in the same problem  we had in the first place. There is no  guarantee, as the gentleman from New  York <Mr. CONABLE) mentioned, that  the assessments will be sufficient to  pay the cost of the diversion program.  Basically,  the wrong  farmers  are  paying the bill and the wrong farmers  are getting the benefit.  Mr. Chairman, I very strongly sup port the Conable amendment and urge  the Members to vote accordingly.  Mr. Chairman, dairy farmers across  the country have been suffering under  a misguided and counterproductive set  of assessments on milk production for  several months now. When the Agri culture Committee began its work ear lier this year, I had hoped that we  would have enacted  legislation  long  before this point in time so that milk  producers would be spared these as sessments.  At last we have the opportunity to  take some meaningful action to deal  with the problems in the dairy pro gram. What specifically are the prob lems we need  to address? First, we  need to bring an end to the enormous  surplus milk production in the coun try. Second, we need to repeal the con fiscatory  and  counterproductive  as sessments now being collected  from  dairymen. Third, we need  to adopt  changes in our dairy program which  will make sure that the program is op erating in a sound manner even after a  few years. Finally, we need to find a  way to do all of these things in a fair  and equitable manner.  The answer  to  these problems  is  simple: Cut price supports and repeal  the assessments. As my colleagues on  the Agriculture Committee know, this  is the course I advocated throughout  our deliberations on dairy legislation.  A paid diversion program fails to meet  several  important objectives. About  the only worthwhile thing the ""com promise bill"" had going for it was the  hope of  repealing  the dairy assess ments. Now, however, even this selling  point of the ""compromise"" no longer  exists. With  the administration op posed to the ""compromise,"" there is  reason to be worried that it will invite  a Presidential veto. If that occurs, we  ",1983

1723,830,22,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  this is the fourth of a series of state ments on the issue of crude oil ex ports. It seems  that misinformation  abounds on the subject in Congress,  and today, I would like to once more  share my thoughts and perspective on  this issue.  It seems that there are two lines of  thought  among  opponents  of  oil  export. The first, and with justifiable  concern, are the special and narrow in terests of the maritime industry. They  are, obviously, concerned with their in vestments and their jobs. The second  concern, and more important one, re lates  to  a  clear  understanding  of  today's world oil market and how the  United States  interacts within  this  market.  In advocating crude oil exports I do  not seek to jeopardize the livelihood of  any industry. However, I find it out right ambiguous that in this period of  high budget deficits, we continue to  forego the collection of billions of dol lars of revenues and instead transfer  this money  to our U.S. merchant  marine.  I wholeheartedly support the main tenance of a U.S. merchant marine ca pable of responding quickly to a na tional emergency. I also believe that  investments made in good faith under  the law should not be compromised.  However, unlike those opposed to ex ports, I firmly believe that exporting  oil and maintaining a  credible U.S.  merchant marine are not mutually ex clusive goals. My proposal, which I will  be sharing with my colleagues soon,  will only allow a limited amount of oil  to be exported and all  in U.S.-flag  tankers. This  approach  should not  affect the emergency preparedness of  our merchant marine nor should  it  jeopardize maritime investments.  The other objection to crude oil ex ports that I hear all too often is ""Why  export crude oil when we are still de pendent upon imports?"" In response to  that, is it not only fair to ask why the  United States, today, exports petrole um products at a rate equivalent to its  imports? The answer is simple. Allow ing free exports and imports of petro leum products best serves the interests  of  consumers  by  letting  the  free  market allocate  the resource  in  the  most efficient and cost competitive  manner. For example, while we import  petroleum products on one coast at  about  725,000  barrels per day, we  export excess supplies on the other  coast at about 670,000 barrels per day.  If we restricted the export of petrole um product like we do crude, I imagine  that surpluses  in one region of the  United States would have to be trans ported to other areas in the United  States, creating an inefficiency in allo cation and a windfall for the tanker  companies employed to transport the  petroleum product.  So, while we recognize that the free  marketplace is the most efficient allo cator for petroleum products, we still  insist that crude oil is altogether dif ferent, and that the United States can  isolate  itself  from  the world  oil  market. The penalty for this type of  thinking results in lost tax revenues of  at least $640 million annually and pos sibly $10 billion over the next decade  in foregone bonus and royalty oil pay ments to the U.S. Treasury.  While the starved Federal Treasury  foregoes the opportunity to bolster its  reserves,  others  opposed  to  export  maintain that Alaskan produced oil is  cheaper  than  imported oil. This  is  pure nonsense. The price of Alaskan  crude on the U.S. gulf coast  is  the  same as Saudi oil delivered to the gulf  coast after adjusting for quality differ ences. In 1979, when the world price of  crude soared, so did Alaskan crude.  The price of Alaskan crude, as well as  other oils throughout the world, are  based on the price of Saudi light, and  always will  be  in  the  foreseeable  future. The only real impact exporting  Alaskan crude oil could have on con sumer price is downward, because al lowing exports provides profit incen tive for producers to look for new oil  and  thereby  lessen  the Middle East  stranglehold on the world market.  Unfortunately, the subject of crude  oil exports has been made out to be a  consumer issue. While it is a blatant  lie to say that the consumer will pay  more if Alaskan crude is exported, it is  fair  to say that the consumer does  gain, indirectly as a  taxpayer. as the  Treasury reaps in revenues that today  fill the pockets of a select few.

As I recall, and I ask the Senator from  Arkansas whether his understanding  is the same-when this body voted on  putting  the MX  into  fixed  silos  in  1981,  it was overwhelmingly rejected  by the U.S. Senate. It was rejected by  many of those in the Senate of the  United States who now support the  MX in fixed silos. In 1981 these same  Senators argued that putting the MX  into fixed silos was going  to  insure  their vulnerability without increasing  our security.  I  am  just wondering whether  the  Senator  from Arkansas  and others  who continue to oppose the MX are  troubled by the change in rationale by  those who now support  the MX  in  fixed silos.  ",1983
1726,856,22,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, the  Senator is, of course, deadly accurate.  In 1981,  this very body voted over whelmingly against building an MX  missile to put in fixed-base silos. Perhaps it was before the Senator came in  this morning when I quoted a  lot of  Senators who said at the time that to  put this missile  in a  fixed-base silo  would be the height of folly.  One of the leaders in that line of ar gument was our late departed brother,  Scoop Jackson, who  time and again  said, ""This  just gives  the Soviets a  better target to shoot at."" And I have  said on the floor of the Senate many  times, of course, that they do not even  have to reprogram their computers to  target those new MX missiles. They  just shoot at the same silos.  The Senator is wise and perceptive  to recall the fact that the Senate said  all of those things then, and he is also  dead right that absolutely nothing has  changed since then that refutes that  logic. The Soviets have changed but  the logic remains compelling against  it.  ",1983
1727,856,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Many have argued  that if Congress rejects the MX, some how we will have demonstrated that  we are not interested in a triad, that  we are not  interested  in moderniza tion, and that we are not interested in  insuring a strategic deterrent. Is it not  the  understanding  of  the Senator  from Arkansas that there is a major  modernization program underway for  our Minuteman missiles that will im prove their accuracy? By rejecting the  MX we certainly are not turning our  back upon the land-based leg of the  triad.  ",1983
1728,856,22,Mr. BUMPERS.," The Senator again,  of course, is absolutely accurate. Talk  about the modernization of the triad,  the D-5,  the Trident  II missile  is  under full research and development;  we are going to build and deploy it.  The Pershing missile is about to be de ployed  in Western Europe. We are  building Trident submarines on the as sembly line. We are cranking out air launched cruise missiles at a  rapid  rate. We have just finished moderniz ing our Minuteman forces.  I could go on forever talking about  what we have done from a moderniza tion standpoint. But when it comes to  the  triad,  think about what we are  about  to do. We have not built a  bomber in 25 years and now we are  going to build two within 5 years. The  B-1 is going to be coming off the as sembly line in 2 more years. We hope  that the Stealth might be operational  by 1990, 1991, a penetrating bomber.  Does that sound like we are giving up  the triad?  And second, to hear the debate, you  would think that to be opposed to MX  meant you were for unilateral disar mament. We are debating a $250 bil lion defense bill. Do you know how  much  this amendment deletes  from  that $250 billion? $2 billion. Does that  sound like a country with no resolve,  that has decided to tell the Russians  to come and get us?  ",1983
1729,856,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," The point made by  the Senator from Arkansas raises an other issue that I would like to ask  him about and that is the question of  national will and resolve.  We in this body have been told by  the administration that if we do not  produce the MX after it has been on  the drawing boards for many years,  somehow we do not have the will or  the determination to def end ourselves.  The Senator from Arkansas has al ready mentioned the Senate's commit ment to the Stealth bomber and the  D-5, and other strategic systems. I am  wondering whether the Senator from  Arkansas  feels  that  the  argument  about national will holds any water?  ",1983
1730,856,22,Mr. BUMPERS.,"  I will not repeat  how much money we are spending on  modernization of our strategic forces.  It is a well-known fact that the B-1,  the Stealth, the Trident submarines,  the Trident I and II missiles, the Per shing, the modernization of the Min uteman III, plus all  the money for  conventional forces, and on and on,  $250 billion worth is in this bill. I do  not know how much money it takes to  show our resolve, frankly. I think re solve  is  important, but  the point  I  want to make  is that intelligence  is  also  important. You do not have to  send your brains on a vacation because  you are a patriot or because you think  we ought to have a strong defense, and  that is precisely what we do when we  spend $17 billion on the most vulnera ble weapons  system anybody  could  conjure up.  ",1983
1731,856,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Finally, I would like  to know whether the Senator believes  that the administration's strong com mitment to the MX missile is incon sistent with any sensible build-down  proposal.  ",1983
1732,856,22,Mr. BUMPERS.,"  I  appreciate  the  Senator asking that question. I intend ed to cover that in my original stat ment but did not get around to it.  Let me point out to the Senator, in  answer to his question, it is absolutely  inconsistent with build-down, No; 1,  for  two  reasons. No.  1,  under  the  START talks, the President originally  proposed 5,000 warheads. That means  we have to dismantle 2,500 warheads  right off the top. The Soviet Union is  going to have to dismantle a  lot of  warheads  right off  the  top. If you  want  to negotiate how fast you are  going to do it, whether you are going  to do it on a percentage basis per year,  that is one thing. But Senator PERCY  on March 1, 1983, when he joined Sen ators NUNN and COHEN on the build down  concept-everyone was  saying  that it was going to go into effect im mediately, we were going to start to  negotiate build-down with the Soviet  Union-the Senator from  Illinois  in  one of his charts set out that one of  the build-downs might be to get the  5,000 warheads which had  already  ",1983
1733,869,22,Mr. GLENN.," Madam President,  I  rise to support the amendment that  would delete production funding for  the MX missile in fiscal year 1984 de fense appropriations.  This Congress will make few deci sions more important in the national  defense and security areas than the  subject of  this morning's proposed  amendment: whether to produce and  deploy the MX missile.  The costs involved are enormous and  likely  to grow. The  implications for  arms  control  are  substantive  and  worthy  of  consideration.  Once  launched, production will be difficult  to halt, and we will have to live with  the results for many years.  My colleagues know me as a strong  supporter  of  our Nation's defense.  Freedom and the power to deter war  by strength are worth whatever they  cost. I have always recognized that an  adequate defense  is not cheap. Even  amidst our current economic morass the result, in very large measure, of  this  administration's own  economic  mistakes-I do not believe that cutting  defense is a magic carpet back to bal anced budgets.  I hope, therefore, that my colleagues  on both sides of this Chamber will rec ognize how reluctantly I came to the  conclusion that, in the case of the MX  missile, we can and should accept the  responsibility of telling the President  that his advisers have made a mistake,  that this weapon system does not rep resent a good investment of the Na tion's defense resources, that it prob ably would not work as planned, and  that if it will not work, it will not help  to deter the Soviets either.  The MX program stands or falls on  the ability of the missile system to sur vive a Soviet surprise attack and hit  back at Soviet hard targets. Existing  U.S.  ICBM's,  the Minuteman  Ill's,  have some capacity for hitting Soviet  hard  targets,  including missile silos,  but their own survival can no longer  be guaranteed against  the accurate  Soviet missiles now available. The MX  program is being justified on the basis  that the MX missiles will be able to  ride out an attack, while their size and  accuracy will make possible a counter attack agaiilst remaining Soviet mis siles. The knowledge of this assured  U.S. capacity, in turn, will deter the  Soviets  from ever  trying a  surprise  attack in the first place. Thus, MX  will contribute to nuclear deterrence  and peace.  I  have  some  problems with  this  whole scenario. While recognizing the  theoretical  possibility  of  a  Soviet  attack against existing missile silos, I  question how large a percentage of our  defense effort we should devote to this  particular  threat. Our bomberand  submarine-launched forces would still  survive-is  a  Soviet Premier  really  likely to bet on our not using them?  But grant,  for  the moment,  the  Soviet  threat  to  land-based  ICBM's  and the need to make our land-based  deterrent more  survivable. MX,  to  play its role, must show that it can  survive. Has the administration made  a case for  its survivability, one that  would justify spending $25 billion or  more? I think not.  Much attention has been paid  to  super hardening of silos. I will not re trace the grounds covered by so many  commentators. But, even if the Con gress  could  be  satisfied  on  these  points,  serious  questions  would  remain. Many of my colleagues will re member  that  I have  long been un happpy with the whole concept that  underlies the MX and skeptical that a  survivable basing mode for MX can  ever be found.  We find ourselves facing a vulner ability problem with our  land-based  missiles-a  vulnerability  problem  which the Soviets also face,  in some  degree, from our Minuteman III mis siles and will face even more strongly  when the Trident D5 comes into serv ice-because both sides chose  to put  several warheads on each missile. This  raises the option, attractive at least in  theory, of destroying 10, 20, or even 30  missiles with the warheads from only  1 missile.  We could buy a lot more survivabil ity, a lot more reliability, a lot cheaper  if our land-based ICBM force included  missiles able to take advantage of de ception, mobility, or some combination  of  both. For  such  use  the  small,  mobile missile would be preferable.  Carrying only a single, very accurate  warhead, such a missile would not be a  very attractive  target; and  if widely  dispersed, would force the Soviets to  waste some of their MIRV capacity.  In short, I believe that the MX mis sile is the wrong solution to the prob lem of ICBM vulnerability and pre sents possibly insoluable problems in  attempting to carry out its mission of  survival and counterattack. For that  reason, I intend to vote against fund ing any production of the missile. If  today's decision is to deny production  funding or at least delay a final deci sion until next year, I hope that the  Congress will emphasize consideration  of alternate missiles, preferably along  the lines of the small, mobile missile,  and furthermore that we will encour age  the executive branch  to do  the  same.  ",1983
1734,869,22,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of Senator BUMPERS' amend ment to delete $2.1 billion in produc tion funds for the MX. I want to com mend Senator BUMPERS  and others  who have taken the lead in this effort  to stop the MX.  Mr. President, today's vote is critical,  for it represents our final opportunity  to stop the nuclear madness which will  be  unleashed  should  the MX-our  most modern and most destablizing  nuclear  strategic  weapon-be  de ployed.  The arguments against MX deploy ment-made persuasively by military  and arms-control experts spanning the  political spectrum-are all too famil iar. Today, with United States-Soviet  relations overwhelmed by heightened  tensions  and mistrust,  those  argu ments are even more compelling.  Mr. President, I am convinced that  deploying MX in vulnerable Minute man silos will do serious harm to our  national security. The MX, deployed  in such a manner will be extremely de stabilizing-vulnerable to a Soviet first  strike while, at the same time, posing  a  first-strike  threat  against Soviet  forces. With a price tag of over $20 bil lion, the MX will be considerably more  costly than other strategic systems robbing other defense programs and  domestic programs of much needed  funds.  Its  arms-control  implications  are devastating, and will likely result  in a deadly acceleration of the nuclear  arms race while increasing the likeli hood of nuclear war.  Notwithstanding  these  compelling  arguments for foregoing MX deploy ment,  some Members of  this body  have agreed to support the President  in his desire to deploy this weapons  system in exchange for an administra tion comntltment to propose an inter im build-down agreement as a precur sor to a detailed START Treaty. How ever, even at this late hour, there ap pears to be some ambiguity with re spect to the President's commitment  to move ahead with such an interim  agreement.  While the administration has clearly  spelled out its intention to incorporate  the build-down concept into the basic  U.S. negotiating position on START,  its commitment to proposing an inter im build-down proposal, which would  envision reductions  in United States  and Soviet nuclear arsenals prior to  the signing of a ST ART agreement,  appears less than clear.  I would urge those who have been  persuaded to support MX deployment  by  the  administration's build-down  commitment to seek a clarification of  that  commitment  prior  to  casting  today's vote.  Once again, I urge my colleagues to  vote  against MX production and  I  commend Senator BUMPERS for intro ducing this amendment.  ",1983
1735,869,22,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, in my  nearly  3  years  in  the Senate,  no  matter has  taken more of my  time  than the issue of nuclear deterrence.  On  this subject,  I  have visited  the  Minuteman silos in Grand Forks, N.  Dak.; inspected the B-1 bomber at Ed wards Air Force Base, Calif.; studied  the nuclear submarines in Charleston,  S.C.; and observed NATO installations  ",1983
1736,882,22,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I compli ment the managers of the bill. I be lieve we are making good progress  today.  Mr. President, this amendment is de signed to protect the Stealth bomber  program. It is the same subject matter  that I was successful in getting into  the authorization bill earlier.  It prohibits any of the money in this  Appropriations measure  earmarked  for the Stealth bomber to be obligated  or expended for any other purpose.  The Stealth program, I believe, is pro gressing satisfactorily and  is on the  cutting edge of American advanced  technology. It is a very highly classi fied program-by virtue of the restric tions on  information concerning  it,  there is no visible national constituen cy to protect it. In the next few years,  therefore, if cost overruns or funding  crunches  occur  in other American  hardware programs, there may well be  a  growing  temptation  to  raid  the  Stealth account. There may be at tempts  to  reprogram  the  Stealth  money for any number of other sys tems.  This amendment is designed to pre vent any diversion of funds for this  crucial program.  One of  the major advantages we  have over the Soviet Union is in the  area of our high technology. We dare  not permit this advantage to lag.  Instead, I think each person who is  convicted of  espionage  against  this  country of ours ought to be shot. I  think we ought to deal with them as  the Soviets deal with some of their  own people. I understand, for exam ple, they executed some of the persons  who were  at  fault  in  allowing  a  Korean plane to fly 1,000 miles west ward in Soviet air space some 2 years  ago. The Soviets finally learned about  this. The Korean pilot was flying west  when he should have been flying east.  The Soviets forced his plane down on  a frozen lake and one or two persons  were killed. I am told, though I do not  know it to be a fact, that they execut ed the Soviet military personnel who  were found to be at fault.  I am not jesting at all when I say  that when  I  read about and hear  about  individuals who  are  selling  American military secrets concerning  our technology to the Soviet Union, to  Bulgaria, or any of the Warsaw Pact  nations,  I would  like  to see us put  some real teeth into the penalty. I am  not sure the court would sustain such  a proposal, but I find it difficult to un derstand why some persons  in  this  country sell or give away secrets that  go to the very heart of our most so phisticated  technology  and  get  off  with not too heavy a penalty.  But that  is beside  the point  now.  just  It is important to keep Stealth on  track, to keep it fully funded, to bring  the technology to maturity as aggres sively as possible.  The Nation needs a new interconti nental strategic bomber, one which is  versatile and capable of performing a  full range of missions. The combina tion of new technologies being incor porated into Stealth will permit that  aircraft to penetrate Soviet airspace  well beyond the turn of the century.  In effect, the technology renders obso lete  a  Soviet  air  defense  network  worth billions of dollars, I suppose certainly, many, many millions of dol lars.  The funding  levels of the Stealth  program  are  highly  classified. The  progress of the technology is highly  classified. The most that can be said  today  is  that the  technology  repre sents the best of U.S. technology and  is progressing satisfactorily. When the  program reaches fruition,  I am sure  that our efforts today to protect its de velopment, to keep it on track, will be  rewarded.  Many Senators, Mr. President, have  become  increasingly  concerned  that  there is a mismatch between the range  of weapons  systems being procured  with  the dollars available over  the  next several years.  If, as  is  feared,  those dollars become thinly stretched  among the many competing programs,  there will be great temptation to slow  down  the development of many of  these systems.  This amendment is intended to serve  notice that such stretchouts, such waf fling, will not be tolerated in the area  of Stealth  technology. We will not  permit any of the money dedicated to  this program to be diverted to com petitor weapons systems. Nor do we  expect anything  less  than  the  full  funding of  the program,  consistent  with prudent management practices from now through the initial operat ing capability <IOC> and finally until  the full operating capability <FOC> of  Stealth is achieved.  Mr. President, that is the purpose of  my amendment. I should be happy to  hear the comments of the manager of  the bill.  ",1983
1737,882,22,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I call  the attention of my good friend to sec tion 767 of the bill, on page 67, which  says:  SEC. 767. Of the funds appropriated by  this Act for strategic programs, the Secre tary of Defense shall provide funds for the  Advanced Technology Bomber program at a  level at least equal to the amount provided  by the committee of conference on this Act  in order to maintain priority emphasis on  this program.  We put that in the bill because of  the discussion we had with the distin guished Senator from West Virginia 2  years ago. It is a matter that has been  pursued in the authorization bill this  year and it is already contained in our  bill. I want to assure the Senator of  our complete commitment to the A TB,  or Stealth, approach. We are pursuing  the R&D in that area.  ",1983
1738,882,22,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I was  aware of the language of the bill.  I  thought it well at least to establish  legislative history that would leave no  question as to the intent of the Con gress.  I am satisfied with what  the  manager has just said.  ,  There being no doubt, I feel that the  legislative history has been helped and  this, in turn, will make it indubitably  clear to those who are responsible for  the program that it is the intent of  Congress  that  this program not be  abated in any way in order to advance  other programs.  With that assurance, Mr. President,  I withdraw the amendment.  The  amendment  <No.  2511>  withdrawn.  ",1983

We are scheduled  to have a  vote on the MX at 2:45 p.m. There is  plenty of time to take up any of these  amendments that require a half-hour  or less. I do hope Senators will present  their amendments to the Senate.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",1983

1747,908,22,Mr. MATTINGLY.," To add to what  the Senator has said,  since we de ployed the Minuteman III from initial  operational capability  in June 1970,  the Soviets have deployed some 820  new MIRV'd ICBM's including the SS17's, 18's, and 19's. The throw weight  of the SS-18 is more than twice the  size of the Peacekeeper and is current ly capable of carrying up to 14 reentry  vehicles, each with twice the yield of  the Mark-12A. The SS-19 is an ICBM  comparable in size and capability  to  the Peacekeeper, and the currently de ployed SS-18 and SS-19 force consists  of about 668 MIRV'd ICBM's with  nearly  5,000  reentry  vehicles,  each  with greater yield and accuracy than  our most modern Minuteman III. And  to add  to  that, even  the SALT  II  treaty, as weak as it is, permits us to  flight test one new ICBM which can  be a MIRV'd MX. If we adopted this  amendment,  it would undercut  the  President's  strategic  modernization  policy directly, not indirectly.  The practical effect of such a mora torium would be  to halt  the MX  Peacekeeper program  in place,  and  thereby to halt the modernization of  our ICBM force. I believe, as the Scow croft Commission has made clear, that  failure  to proceed with  the MX de ployment would undercut deterrence,  weaken  the  triad, and make  it  far  more difficult to achieve an equal and  verifiable START agreement. In sup port of the MX deployment and pro duction,  of which  continued  flight  testing is a key step, the Congress has  endorsed repeatedly the Scowcroft rec ommendations. This  amendment  is  really a backdoor attempt to reverse  the Congress'  endorsement  of  the  Peacekeeper program and represents a  repudiation of the newly formed bi partisan consensus on strategic mod ernization and arms control.  ",1983
1748,908,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President,  if I may again just briefly respond, I  think  there  is  a  serious misunder standing that somehow we stop the  testing and production of the MX. We  only halt test flights of the MX  if,  indeed, the Soviets have agreed to do  so. Up until that time we continue pro duction and we  continue  testing.  I  think  it  is  something  that,  indeed,  does fit  into  the START  talks as  I  mentioned that are ongoing and to the  Scowcroft Commission  recommenda tions.  From a historic reference, it is inter esting to note that in 1970 there was a  vote taken in the Senate on this very  same issue. It passed 72 to 6. The pur pose of that was that testing and de ployment of  the multiple warheads  would seriously destabilize the strategic balance by enabling us to attack  and destroy most of the other side's  strategic weapons by using only  a  small portion of our own weapons. If,  indeed, at that time we had followed  what was an enormous vote  in  the  Senate to halt the testing, we would  have already moved to a single war head in all probability and that is the  very stability that the Scowcroft Com mission was trying to address.

1755,908,22,Mr.  LEVIN.," Mr.  President, my  friend, the Senator from Idaho, indi cated that the Soviet Union has a dif ferent set of ethics.  Indeed,  that  is  true and  that should be  the main  reason why we should not want them  to have  the SS-X-24,  the solid fuel  missile which is going to give them tre mendous new military capability. We  should not want  them  to have  the  mods of the 18's and 19's, which will  give them greater military capability.  It is because they are dangerous that  we  should  try  to  stop  them  from  having  additional missiles  in  their  hands.  It has been argued that this amend ment calls for a unilateral freeze. It  does not. It calls for a mutual pause. It  says that we will be willing to stop the  flight testing of our MIRV'd ICBM's if  the Soviet Union will do likewise. It is  not based on faith. It is not unilateral.  It requires verification.  It is then urged upon us that the So viets will never stop testing of their  land-based missiles. My  friend  from  Arizona, I believe, said that the Sovi ets will not stop testing. If they will  not stop the testing, we have not lost  anything because this amendment re quires  that the pause on  the flight  testing be a mutual pause, not a uni lateral pause.  Mr. President,  this Senate  in  the  early 1970's was faced with a similar  problem, and by an overwhelming vote  the Senate sent a message to the then  President, ""For Heaven's sake, offer a  pause on the flight testing of MIRV'd  ICBM's  to  the Soviet Union."" The  President did, and for reasons which  are now somewhat obscure in history  the Soviet Union rejected it. We can  take  that  initiative  again with  the  Soviet Union. The worst  that  can  happen to us is that the Soviet Union  will say no and then the finger will be  pointed directly at them.  ",1983
1756,908,22,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, nothing  has a higher priority for this country  than  reaching  a mutual,  verifiable  arms control agreement between our  Government and the Soviet Union.  In  the  timely pursuit of such an  agreement we must explore many dif ferent strategies and, while we cannot  adopt them all, I believe that the pro posal embodied in this amendment has  great merit.  The  idea of a pause  in the flight  testing of ICBM's with more than one  warhead is another step in the right  direction-it is clearly in the national  interest.  It would,  I  believe, help create a  positive atmosphere at  the ST ART  talks and present a clear challenge to  the Soviets to make a similar move. It  should be stressed  that  this  is not  meant as a unilateral action and,  if  there  is no response from the other  side, we are not constrained from con tinuing our own testing.  But,  it  is a  first step-an off er to  begin moving away from the cliff-for  that reason alone, it deserves the sup port of the full Senate.  ",1983

The Scowcroft Commission has offi cially stated that MIRVing of our mis siles  is a destabilizing element  that  contributes to increased tensions with  the Soviet Union. Moreover, the Com mission recommended the deployment  of  the  so-called Midgetman missile  with a single warhead. Integral to this  idea is the adoption of an arms control  posture aimed at building down force  levels on both sides.  I disagreed with the Scowcroft Com mission in one important area; it advo cated deployment of the MX missile  which I believe will increase the ten sions  that exist between  the Soviet  Union and the United States. In de ploying  the MX,  the United States  sacrifices a measure of its own securi ty. For each MX deployed, we must  destroy 7 Minuteman III missiles or 29  Minuteman  II missiles. This means  that we decrease the overall number  of targets while we increase the value  of each target. I believe that MIRV's  ",1983

1767,921,22,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, today, I  am  introducing  the  ""Natural Gas  re~-t  Market Adjustment Act of 1983,"" for  consideration by my colleagues in the  interest of providing stability to natu ral gas prices for the Nation's residen tial gas consumers. I  request the bill  be printed and properly referred  in  the RECORD. This proposal seeks to ad dress the problem of the contractual  rigidities which have turned the cur law's price  ceilings  into  price  floors. This bill would address only  three areas of vital concern: A reduc tion in take-or-pay requirements for 3  years to 50 percent; voiding certain in definite price escalator clauses which  threaten a contractual price spike in  1985; and finally, the establishment of  a prospective prudent purchase rule  for  pipeline  purchased  gas  adjust ments.  First of all, this measure would pro vide greater relief to the Nation's con sumers from burdensome take-or-pay  clauses by reducing the required take  to 50 percent for 3 years. This reduc tion would be triggered at the election  of the purchaser, after notice is pro vided to the seller no less than 30 days  prior to the delivery of the reduced  volumes. The volumes not taken would  then be released to the seller for sale  to another purchaser and, if the origi nal purchaser was  a  pipeline,  that  pipeline would be obligated to trans port the gas for a ""just and reasona ble""  consideration.  In addition,  the  measure would ban contract provisions  which would operate to prevent ade quate makeup of gas volumes which  have been paid for but not taken.  A  recently  released  report by  the  Congressional Budget Office  states  that these take-or-pay provisions  im posed in supply contracts have forced  pipelines to assume nearly all of the  risks associated with marketing gas  and  have  thus  insulated  producers  from market signals. These  take-or pay provisions appear most frequently  in high-cost gas contracts and force  pipelines to reduce purchases of cheap  gas due to contractual liabilities under  these clauses.  Second, this measure would void cer tain indefinite price escalator clauses.  This is consistent with previous orders  of  the Federal Power Commission the FERC's predecessor-and court de cisions as well. In 1961, the FPC pro hibited certain indefinite price escala tors,  such  as  most-favored-nation  clauses, which allow prices  to auto matically escalate to any higher prices  that any other purchaser is paying in  a certain geographic area. The FPC  order  did  allow  certain  regulatory  action  clauses which  permit  price  hikes to an allowable regulated rate.  In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court indi cated that indefinite escalator clauses  by  their design and  function alone  may be incompatible with the public  interest.  ",1983
1768,934,22,Mr. ZABLOCKI.," Mr. Speaker, for  many years Members of Congress, and  particularly members of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, have profited from  the active research and study efforts  of the Atlantic Council. This highly  respected association of some of the  most prominent foreign Policy think ers has long performed a much needed  service by tackling most difficult, yet  relevant, problems facing the United  States in its foreign relations.  Consistent with its earlier undertak ings,  the Atlantic Council has  just  completed a major study of United  States-China palicy. Given the great  attention on U.S. relations with China  and the prospects ahead,  this study  could not be more timely. Therefore, I  ask that the executive summary and  the list of members of the study group  be included in the record at this paint,  so that my colleagues can have con venient access to the major findings of  the Atlantic Council's work.  The executive summary follows:  ExEcuTivE SUJOIARY  As the euphoria of the US-PRC relation ship has been replaced with the daily toil of  managing the relationship, each side has  grown to view the other with some caution.  The present American adlninistration has  emphasized a greater concern about defense  policy and the Chinese have exhibited a  more assertive nationalism with calls for in dependence from the two superpowers. i.e.  an  intermediate position between the US  and the USSR. Though Beijing is still in im portant aspects closer to Washington than  to Moscow,  tactical  repositioning by  the  Chinese either closer to Moscow <as in 1982>  or to the US <as appears to be emerging in  1983) has tended in the past to produce ad  hoc policy responses by the US, responses  which many of our friends and allies viewed  as more emotional than pragmatic and not  always supportive of their interests.  The Atlantic Council's Committee  on  China Policy has sought to appraise the in terests of both countries.  to understand  where those interests converge or diverge.  to break the romantic notions of inevitable  harmony or hostility, and to recommend  policies upon which to base a long-term re lationship.  This policy paper examines the current  state of bilateral  relations between  the  United States and China; projects the most  desirable and realistic objectives for the US  government and ways to achieve them; sur veys  the prospective  influence and  likely  interaction of other key actors who may in fluence the relationship; and discusses how  the US can best coordinate its policies to  satisfy the interest.a and allay the anxieties  of it.a Atlantic and Pacific friends and allies  and to avoid complicating the Taiwan ques tion.  The Committee then concludes with the  following policy  recommendations  to  the  Administration concerning future policy of  the United States toward China. These are  recommendations  the Committee believes  the public and the Congress wil endorse and  that our friends and allies will recognize and  support as contributing to global stability  and their own security.  GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS  1. The United States Government should  develop a sound long-term posture through  the next decade that seeks enhanced coop eration with the People's Republic of China  <PRC>-a very  large and underdeveloped  country-which,  as an  independent, non aligned  international and  regional entity,  shares some but not all of our global and re gional objectives, particularly in Asia and  the Pacific.  2. An economically healthy, stable, and  secure China, which  contributes  to  the  peace and stability of the region, is in the  national interest of the United States, and  is an interest shared by our Asian and Euro pean friends and allies. To  this end,  the  United States should place priority on the  continued development of a sound geopoliti cal relationship with China and on the en hancement of cooperation with China in de veloping its economic potential.  3. Relations with  the PRC and other  countries in the region require that the US  maintain a strong military presence in East  Asia and the Pacific and make clear we are  committed to a forward military defense of  our interests in the region.  4. The United States, more than it has the  recent past, should consult with and take  into account the views of its Asian friends  and allies in dealing with the PRC and en courage reciprocal consultations. Specifical ly, the security and economic concerns of  Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the na tions of ASEAN and ANZUS, and the popu lation of Taiwan should be taken into ac count.  5. Our Atlantic friends and allies should  also be consulted with respect to our China  policies and encouraged to consult with the  US with respect to their policies. It is impor tant that our respective policies be compati ble, particularly in the areas of technology  transfer  and  international  trade.  The  United States and its industrialized friends  and allies in the coming decade should do in  concert what we can to facilitate China's  economic development. A process for con tinuing  consultations  among  the  allies  should be established to facilitate coopera tion in helping China in such areas as Joint  feasibility studies for projects to be financed  by government funding.  BILATERAL RELATIONS  6. The United States and China share cer tain geopolitical objectives, such as oppos ing Soviet expansionism, making possible  cooperative efforts  in various forms. Our  policy objectives with respect to Afghani stan and Indochina are similar and call for  further consultations. On the Korean Pe ninsula, despite  the fact that the United  States and China support different parties,  our objectives in avoiding hostilities are par allel. The United States and  the PRC  9.  should urge their respective Korean allies to  adopt policies supportive of these objectives.  The United States should also encourage  the PRC to develop further contacts with  South Korea that could point the way to  eventual cross-recognition. In other areas,  such as  the Middle East and Southern  Africa, we should seek our common interest;  and wherever and whenever our interests  converge, we should cooperate.  7. The basis of our relations with China  should not rest exclusively on our common  opposition to the Soviet Union. We should  seek to expand the basis of the relationship  to rest on economic, scientific, and cultural  ties, on shared efforts to maintain stability  in Asia, and on Chinese involvement in the  search for solutions to the problems that  transcend  national  boundaries  <such  as  arms limitations or international economic  issues).  8. While the United States must show ap preciation of Chinese needs,  sensitivities,  and  domestic  political  environment,  the  same attitude is required of the PRC toward  the United States. If the relationship is to  move forward and continue to enjoy broad  public support  in  the United States,  the  Chinese must demontrate greater awareness  of American sensitivities and appreciation  of our domestic political system <including  the separation of powers> and our pluralistic  society. U.S. officials should make clear that  Chinese  rhetorical excesses only serve  to  undermine support in the United States for  strengthening United States-Chinese  rela tions and complicate US diplomacy on inter national issues.  Throughout  the  next  decade,  the  United States should cooperate with  the  PRC primarily through trade, export cred its, and direct  investment  in the Chinese  economy. The United States should facili tate and promote US private sector partici pation in Chinese economic growth and en courage China to establish a favorable cli mate for American enterprises, as, for exam ple, in the areas of developing coal, renew able energy resources, potential of off-shore  oil and gas reserves, and agriculture.  10. To facilitate commercial trade in line  with US export policies, the Committee rec ommends that the Joint Economic Commis sion and  the Joint Commission on Com merce and Trade and their working groups  should explore each other's laws and regula tory practices in order to defuse potentially  disruptive trade issues stemming from asym metries in business and government prac tices.  11. The US should actively promote the  transfer of technologies that are consistent  with China's economic development needs  and abilities to absorb. At the same time,  the US should continue to press the PRC to  promulgate and enforce laws <patent, copy right, etc.> necessary to protect the interests  of the industrialized nations in technology  transferred.  Correspondingly,  the  PRC  should join such international agreements  as General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the Paris Convention, and  the Universal  Copyright Conventions.  12. The Committee asserts that it is in the  US national interest that the Chinese na However, it recognizes this course involves a  degree of risk since a strong Chinese industional economy move toward modernization.  e This """"bullcc"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

1769,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY., Will  yield for a question?  ,1983
1770,960,22,Mr. PRYOR., I am very glad to yield  to my friend from Massachusetts.  ,1983
1771,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," I thank the Senator  from Arkansas for yielding for a ques tion.  As I understand the argument of the  Senator from Arkansas, recent reviews  of our chemical weapons have indicat ed that there has not been a deteriora tion of our stockpile.  ",1983
1772,960,22,Mr. PRYOR.,"  In  response  to my  friend and colleague from Massachu setts, he is absolutely correct when he  states  that  the General Accounting  Office did, in its report, state:  the Senator  The United States has a large stockpile of  toxic  chemical munitions  to deter other  countries from using chemical warfare and  to retaliate if deterrence is unsuccessful.  In this report and  in previous  re ports and  in subsequent reports, we  see no true indication that the present  stockpile has deteriorated significant ly.  ",1983
1773,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," The second point  that the Senator from Arkansas has  made  today  is that the tests of the  Bigeye binary bomb have not been  conclusive in terms of its reliability. Is  the Senator  from Arkansas  saying  that  the  reliability  of  the Bigeye  binary bomb is in question and that,  even  though  the Senate  raised  this  issue  on  previous  occasions,  those  problems have not been addressed.  ",1983
1774,960,22,Mr.  PRYOR.," The Senator  from  Massachusetts is absolutely right. In  every report that we have seen, we  have not been able to establish, one,  that the Bigeye bomb works or, two,  that it is safe or, three, that it would  not kill more of the enemy than it  might kill of our own people. It is a  very dangerous and untested weapon,  and we are here today attempting to  appropriate additional millions of dol lars for its production.  ",1983
1775,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, argu ment has been made that we need new  chemical weapons as a bargaining chip  in the Geneva negotiations. This is an  argument that has been used quite ef fectively on the floor with regard to  the MX missile. It is my understand ing that the negotiations to date have  been in a multilateral forum, and that  we have not engaged in direct bilateral  negotiations with the Soviet Union to  ban chemical weapons.  It is my understanding that existing  international agreements on chemical  weapons do not have adequate verifi cation provisions.  Certainly, I believe that it is essen tial that we have adequate verification  procedures in any agreement between  the United States  and  the Soviet  Union and that we ought to challenge  the Soviet Union in front of the world  community  to negotiate a verifiable  ban on  the production and deploy ment of chemical weapons.  Is that the position of the Senator  from Arkansas?  ",1983
1776,960,22,Mr.  PRYOR.," The Senator  from  Massachusetts has accurately stated  my position.  Furthermore, Mr. President, relative  to  the Bigeye bomb,  if  the Bigeye  bomb does not work or if it might kill  more of our own boys than the enemy,  I certainly do not think that is much  of a bargaining chip.  Finally, I would say that when we  produce this new generation of nerve  gas and have no place to store it, I  would only conclude that we are going  to try to store it right here in this  country. Then it will be too late to use  it as a retaliatory measure, as the Sen ator from Alaska suggested earlier in  the debate.  ",1983
1777,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Finally, could the  Senator give us an update as to wheth er  the  governments  of Western  Europe-where this weapon would be  utilized-are willing  to  store  this  weapon on their soil and whether they  want to have it in their arsenals?  ",1983
1778,960,22,Mr. PRYOR.," I respond to my friend  from Massachusetts by saying that in  West Germany, since 1970, that Gov ernment has stated explicitly that not  only will they store no more chemical  weapons produced in this country on  their soil; further, they will not even  train  their personnel  to use  them.  That is how strong their position is.  That is the reason that, today, when  we produce this massive new quantity  of chemical weapons, we are not going  to have anywhere to store them.  I might just say that, shortly, there  will be an amendment offered by the  distinguished Senator from Minnesota  <Mr. BOSCHWITZ), I understand, which  will be a build-down amendment. It  will state that as we produce this new  generation of chemical weapons and  nerve gas, we will destroy  the old  stockpiles. I have a question I want to  pose to him at the proper time in the  debate: How do we destroy  it? The  answer is: We have no way of destroy ing it.  So, Mr. President, what we are going  to be doing is increasing the stockpile  of old and new nerve gas agents, and it  looks like all of it is going to be stored  right here on  this  soil, because  in  Europe, they will not store it.  ",1983
1779,960,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator for his responses  and for the leadership he has provided  on this issue.  ",1983
1780,960,22,Mr. PRYOR.,"  I  thank  the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts.  Mr. President, I reserve the remain der of my time.  ",1983
1781,960,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, who  is in control of the time?  ",1983
1782,960,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Alaska and the Senator  from Oregon have control of the time.  ,1983
1783,960,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Would the Senator  from Alaska or his representative yield  me 3 minutes?  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that I be allowed to speak for 3  minutes in support of the amendment.  ",1983
1784,960,22,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, I have  permission to yield 3 minutes of the  time  allotted  to  the Senator  from  Alaska  to  the distinguished Senator  from Louisiana.  ",1983
1785,960,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Chair  recognizes  the Senator  from  Louisiana.  ,1983
1786,960,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, just  very briefly on the question of wheth er or not present stocks of chemical  weapons are deteriorating or not-",1983
1787,960,22,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, may  we have quiet? Those who have  to  talk, there is plenty of room on the  outside. No bombs are bursting in the  air. This  is  an  awfully  important  matter.  ",1983
1788,960,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Louisiana is recognized.  ,1983
1789,960,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President, in  the colloquy a moment ago the ques tions was  asked whether  or  not  present stocks of chemical weapons  are deteriorating, and the answer was  that  they were not. Mr. President,  that happens to be at variance with  the Gold report which states as fol lows:  Based on  the data accumulated by  the  Chemical Systems Laboratory, the Tooele  Army Depot Laboratory, and other labora tories there is evidence of slow decomposi tion (5-20 percent> of the chemical agents  <GB and VX and possibly H> over a 20-25  year period. Leakage in artillery shells has  been observed. ""Leakers"" are isolated and  either sealed or detoxified as part of the  routine surveillance procedures. The frac tion of ""leakers"" is small Oess than six per  ten-thousand artillery projectiles> and  in  most cases, the leaks seem to occur at im properly fitted joints or brazed joints. There  are also occasional leaks in the bombs, rock ets, spray and bulk storage tanks.  ",1983
1790,973,22,Mr. HATFIELD., Will  the Senator  yield for a question at this point?  ,1983
1791,973,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," I would ask the  Senator if I could continue, and I will  yield for a question at the termination  of my  remarks, which  is almost  in  hand.  It is to this point that my amend ment addresses itself. Although I find  the arguments for the production of  binary weapons compelling, I am sure  all my colleagues would  join me  in  characterizing them as necessary evils  at best. This fact, combined with the  low marginal value which such weap ons have when used in combat, makes  it desirable to limit their production  and stockpiling as much as possible. I  would find this amendment, which will  allow modernization of our chemical  munitions, much less palatable if its  net effect were to further increase the  quantity  of  our  chemical weapons  stockpile.  To that end, I propose this amend ment, similar to the one I had filed  when  the Defense authorization bill  was considered, which was to insure  that this modernization bill will not  serve as a euphemism for enlarging  our  chemical  weapons  stockpile.  Indeed,  the amendment  reflects my  belief that we can actually reduce the  overall level of our military chemical  stockpiles by not simply replacing uni tary chemical munitions with binary  ones, but by also reducing our supply  of bulk agents by a  like amount. My  amendment will have the net effect of  destroying two of our current chemi cal weapons  supply  for  every new  binary munition produced, in effect a  double  reduction by destroying  the  equivalent of two unitary weapons for  each binary built.  I have no fear that this measure will  deplete our chemical weapons invento ry to dangerously low levels. Indeed, I  find many of the comparisons which  are often drawn between the chemical  weapons  stockpiles  of  the United  States and the Soviet Union on behalf  of this amendment unpersuasive. The  marginal value of chemical weapons  on  the battlefield declines  rapidly.  Their effect on an enemy with ade quate defensive gear will be greatest at  the outset but declines rapidly once  passive defense measures are  taken.  Relatively few munitions, then, are re quired to maintain an adequate deter rent in this field. That fact, coupled  with the fact that the United States,  unlike the Soviet Union, does not have  to maintain a  stockpile of chemical  weapons large enough for use against  insurgents who oppose its-the Sovi ets-imperialistic ambitions,  suggests  that a reduction in our chemical weap ons stockpile can be effected without  endangering our deterrent's effective ness.  I  therefore urge all my colleagues,  whatever  their attitude  toward  the  principal amendment,  to  lend  their  support to my amendment. To do so  will insure that if the amendment of  the Senator from Alaska is adopted it  will not be the unwitting vehicle for a  net increase in our overly large chemi cal munitions stockpile. Rather, his  amendment, as amended, will allow for  modernization but at the same time  take some initial steps toward reduc ing these weapons out of existence.  I yield the floor.  ",1983
1792,973,22,Mr. HATFIELD.," I would like to ask  the Senator to yield for a question. If I  understand the Senator correctly, his  amendment, which  I believe  is also  subject to a point of order, is propos ing  that we  trade  two new binary  chemical weapons  for  one  existing  weapon in the arsenal?  ",1983
1793,973,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," No, no; the Sena tor has that backward. Two existing  weapons or their equivalent. In some  of the unitary weapons, the chemical  is  stored  in drums. The equivalent  chemical or weapon itself.  ",1983
1794,973,22,Mr. HATFIELD.," I see. I am glad to  get it in that ratio.  Now,  let me ask, would  this be a  tradeoff from the deliverable-repaira ble portion of the chemical arsenal or  from the nonrepairable-nondeliverable  portion?  ",1983
1795,973,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," The amendment  states that for each new binary muni tion produced at  least one existing  serviceable  chemical  artillery  shell  shall be reduced, and also the equiva lent of chemical, some of which  is  stored not in the weapons themselves  but in drums.  ",1983
1796,973,22,Mr. HATFIELD., Does the Senator  know which portion of the chemical  arsenal he is dealing with then in the  tradeoff? What percentage of the total  arsenal?  ,1983
1797,973,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Sixty percent of  the chemical  is stored in drums, 40  percent in weapons.  ",1983
1798,973,22,Mr. HATFIELD.," How many  tons  does that 60 percent represent, or to  how many weapons does it equate?  ",1983
1799,973,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ., I ask the Senator  since apparently he knows and I do  ,1983
1800,986,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Who  yields time?  ,1983
1801,986,22,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President. I do  oppose the amendment. I am sorry if  there has been a failure to communi cate the position I  thought we were  negotiating. There was  a misunder standing on that. and it is unfortunate  that  that  is  the case. But  the net  effect of the amendment of the Sena tor from Texas is to take out of con ference those items that we have re duced from the House bill. below the  House allowance in most instances.  In addition. it adds in some moneys  that we  took out. Those  items are  items that neither the House commit tee nor  the Senate committee  felt  should be funded under the circum stances.  Now, we can go through those on a  point-to-point basis. I think the main  thing at stake is whether those of us  who spend time going over these items  in detail after we see what the House  has done in the appropriations process  are going  to have  the flexibility  to  deal with this appropriations process  as we know it. It is slightly different  from the authorization process. It is a  matter dealing primarily with dollar  signs. and  this  requires a different  kind of negotiation.  But in any event. beyond that are  some items that are in the bill which  are not specifically authorized by this  year's  authorization  bill.  although  they are authorized. There is $300 million to fund the cleanup on military  reservations and property under the  control of the Department of Defense  to comply with EPA orders. to comply  with  policies  of  this  country  that  affect every other piece of real estate  in the country but do not affect the  DOD until it has money to comply.  We found PCB's. we found hazard ous materials. we found unsightly and  in  some  instances unexpended ord nance.  live ammunition.  in some of  these properties that used to be active  as far as the military is concerned and  that are now not in use by the mili tary.  but  they  are  not  usable  to  anyone else because  they have not  been decontaminated.  This $300 million is for that purpose.  and it is authorized. It is the general  law of the United States as far as the  EPA is concerned.  The Department of Defense  just  looks at us and says. ""We're sorry. we  can't do  that. We  don't have  the  money."" We put up the funds for it at  this time. and I think it is a legitimate.  authorized goal of  the Defense De partment to comply with the laws of  the United States.  There  is  nothing  that  says we  cannot appropriate money unless it is  specifically authorized by this year's  authorization  bill. There  are  some  things that are authorized by general  law of the United States. and I claim  that this is one.  The other thing is that. as we did in  1982, we have  included $300 million  for  Coast Guard  acquisition.  The  Coast Guard  is  under  tremendous  pressure, brought about primarily by  the  interdiction  of  foreign  drugs  coming into our country. As we know,  the Coast Guard  has  been  hard  pressed to keep up with that problem.  They also have an increasing prob lem in terms of law enforcement. They  have authorized activities. We have  added $300 million in the Defense bill  to  take care of the Coast Guard to  carry out the policy of the committee  that has tried to transfer to the Re serve and the National Guard and the  Coast Guard new equipment. to make  available to them first-run equipment.  rather than have them take hand-me downs from the Defense Department.  The Coast Guard  is  a military  branch of  this Government.  It de serves money out of the Defense bill.  It has been overlooked because it is  looked at, primarily by the administra tion and by the OMB, as being a civil ian agency. which is its predominant  role in peacetime. It still has a readi ness  role  so  far as defense  is  con cerned. and in wartime it is literally  the Coast Guard that defends our Na tion's perimeter.  We did  this  in 1982. and we have  done it this year on the same basis,  that it is authorized by general law.  There are some other items that go  beyond the specific amount authorized  in  the authorization bill.  I will be  happy  to  discuss  them with  any  Member of the Senate. We have a list  here.  We held hearings  from February  through September. We have 5,300  pages of testimony that the Senator  from Mississippi  and  I  and others  took. in order to look into the details  of appropriations under the authoriza tion bill that has become law.  What the amendment of the Sena tor from Texas says is. ""Forget about  all that. Nothing in the bill before you  can be any different from the authori zation bill we passed earlier this year.""  If the Senate wants to do that. then  let us do away with the appropriation  process. I  thought we were supposed  to look at the general authorization  which appropriates maximums. It says  that no more than a certain amount  can be appropriated. We look at those  items and say how much should be ap propriated.  There are thousands of items in this  bill. My staff and I have gone over  every one of them. We have done the  best we can. and  the Senator from  Mississippi and his staff have worked  with us.  We believe that the bill before the  Senate adequately addresses the ap propriations process.  taking  into ac count the fact that we are going to  conference. and we hope to  increase  the House amount. We are $5.8 billion  over the House. The net effect of the  Senator's amendment, unfortunately.  is  to give back into the process the  amount the House already announced  it wants.  That is not the way it works in con ference. Mr. President, and I hope the  Senate will understand.  We have a series of other items in  this bill that are not specifically au thorized by the current authorization  bill. For example.  there is an Army  item called the tactical embedded com puter. The House put up $20 million  for that. and we agreed with them. It  is needed.  We have other items I could men tion. We have added $50 million for  the research and development of the  fighter engine. That is to bring about  equality in order to carry on this com petition and bring it to an end. That  competition was  specifically author ized in the past.  In the Air Force. we have an Air  Force System Air Command item for  $30.6 million. It is a trans! er of funds.  but it is not specifically authorized.  There is no question that some of  these  items are not specifically au thorized in this year's bill. We  take  the position that they were either au thorized by a previous authorization  bill or are authorized by general law.  The House has a series of such items.  The effect of  the Senator's amend ment would be to reduce the House  ",1983

I  worked forcefully  to  insist  that the  build down be  implemented  in  full.  The build down would allow us to use  the MX's bargaining leverage. Under  the build down, Soviet compromise in  arms control would allow the United  States to avoid MX deployment and it  would help rid the United States of  the threat posed by Moscow's MX-like  weapons that are already in operation.  I had the President's personal assur ances of a deep commitment to this  approach. But for the time it seemed  that junior officials were resisting this  agreement. I, therefore, wrote to the  President on July 29, repeating my un derstanding of the May MX vote and  alerting him of efforts to undermine  the arrangements. Soon thereafter, I  was reassured by Judge William Clark,  the President's National Security Ad viser,  that the build-down would be  put into place at the Geneva  talks.  That has now been done. Instructions  given  to our START negotiators  in  Geneva were appropriately changed at  the start of October.  The MX flight test program began  in early summer. This may be the type  of proof that the Soviets require  in  moving from rhetoric to action in arms  control. Given the fact that the Sovi ets had previously started flight tests  of their SS-X-24, MX flight  testing  seemed a prudent step.  I  believe  that  the MX vote,  the  build-down proposal and initial flight  testing have created conditions for de termining Soviet seriousness and for  protecting against Soviet strategic ad vantage.  In  cosponsoring  the  Kassebaum  MIRV'd weapons flight test moratori um, I acted in the belief that we have  taken sufficient steps to promote ne gotiations to make the MX and com parable Soviet  systems unnecessary.  Adopting the actions called for by the  amendment would allow  the United  States to sustain conditions for a suc cessful outcome in Geneva.  I  asked  the President  to consider  this before  taking additional actions  with regard to the MX that could un dermine opportunities for significant,  verifiable and mutual arms reductions.  The  vote  on  this  amendment was  close-42 Senators voted in its favor  and 50 were opposed. There is a clear  signal here  for  the  administration.  Other Senators and I will be closely  monitoring the situation. Should the  MX be deployed it must not be for  lack of American efforts to reduce the  number of destabilizing MIRV'd mis siles.  Madam President, the MX must not  be allowed to acquire a life of its own.  Its real value to the United States can  be best achieved only if its deployment  becomes unnecessary.  ",1983

1812,1025,22,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  think it is important to note that the  use of 502 or 503 funds in any project  is dependent on private sector funding  as well. In the 502 and 503 programs,  50 percent of any project's financing  must come from non-Federal sources  with 10 additional percent provided by  the recipient of the funds. Thus, any  project  using  combination  funding  must have community and private, as  well as government, support.  I would urge my colleagues to make  themselves familiar with  the  impor tance of these loan moneys to their  own States. I think they will find that  without the legal clarification provid ed in my bill, communities and small  businesses all over the country will be  losers. The Congress made this error  and should move quickly to correct it.  By Mr. HEFLIN:  S. 2070. A bill to amend certain pro visions of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1954  relating  to the reporting of  tips in the case of certain food and  beverage establishments; to the Com mittee on Finance.  REPORTING OF TIPS IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN  FOOD AND BEVERAGE ESTABLISHMENTS  ",1983
1813,1025,22,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing a bill to address many  11-059 0-87-33 <Pt. 22)  of  the  problems  that  have  arisen  under the tip reporting requirements  of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Respon sibility Act of 1982 <TEFRA>. Restau rant owners, operators, and employees  in Alabama, and throughout the coun try, are rightfully concerned over the  tremendous burden placed upon them  by the reporting and allocation of res taurant employees' tip income.  As my colleagues will remember, the  Senate clearly expressed its opposition  to  the  tip  income reporting require ments when it deleted these provisions  from TEFRA by a vote of 70 to 25. I  cosponsored that amendment and, in a  speech before the Senate, stated that  Congress would be making a  grave  error if it imposed this unfair and un workable burden on the waiters and  waitresses of America and the restau rant industry. Unfortunately, the tax  bill came back from conference with  these provisions added back.  I  then  voted against final passage of TEFRA.  Mr. President, I still strongly believe  that  these  provisions must  be  re pealed.  Traveling  throughout  my  home State of Alabama I have listened  to the strong concerns expressed over  these regulations by waitresses, wait ers, and restaurant operators. In re sponse to their concerns I joined with  my colleague from South Dakota, Sen ator PRESSLER,  in sponsoring  legisla tion to repeal these provisions. I be lieve  that  these  requirements would  not  only  generate  a  bureaucratic  nightmare of  recordkeeping and  re porting for small businesses, but they  would also create an adversary rela tionship between the employer and his  employees.  Until Congress  repeals  the  tip  re porting law I believe we must provide  relief  to restaurant owners and em ployees from the law's most onerous  requirement, the allocation provision.  Under TEFRA, employers are required  to allocate income to an employee that  does not report tips aggregating 8 per cent or more of gross receipts of the  restaurant's sales. This income may or  may not have been received by that in dividual. In rural States, such as Ala bama, where tipping is less than the  national average, our restaurant em ployees will be forced to prove they  make less than 8 percent of the restau rant sales. This is a novel approach to  enforcement of our tax laws and has  no parallel in the remainder of the  Tax Code. The Federal Government is  certainly entitled to collect all taxes  owed to it, but it should not require  private citizens to become, in effect,  revenue agents. This is precisely what  this allocation requirement would do.  Not only would this requirement place  a new financial burden on restaurant  owners and operators, it also has the  potential of being most damaging to  employee/ employer relations.  The bill  I  am  introducing would  modify the allocation requirements of  the tip reporting provisions contained  in TEFRA. Essentially, this bill would  allow the employer to provide the nec essary  information  to  the  Internal  Revenue Service for it to make deter minations of tax liability. Therefore, if  the reported tip income of an employ ee fails to equal or exceed 8 percent of  the  restaurant's  gross  receipts,  it  would be up to the IRS to determine if  any tax liability is owed. This would  eliminate the process of requiring a  restaurant owner or operator to allo cate income to an employee and place  the burden of proof on the IRS where  it rightfully belongs.  Mr. President,  this untenable new  burden  on  restaurants  and  hotels  across this country, many of which are  small, family operated enterprises,  is  ill-conceived  and unnecessary. Until  Congress passes  legislation repealing  these provisions, my bill will provide  needed relief from  the  tip reporting  requirements. I urge my colleagues to  give it their whole hearted support.

",1983
1814,1038,22,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, we  are faced with a peculiar situation:  The natural gas market is disordered  and threatens to become more so; con sumers are paying more than market  clearing prices for gas and those con sumers that can are switching to oil;  producers are having great difficulty  selling their gas;  their selling prices  are falling; prices are threatening to  jump in January 1985 because of cer tain provisions-indifinite price escla tors-in  existing  contracts;  pipeline  companies  face  financial  catastophe  caused by take-or-pay provisions they  signed  in  the middle 1970's; willing  consumers want to buy gas from will ing producers but the connecting pipe lines refuse to move the gas; and legis lation  to  remedy  these problems  is  widely perceived to be necessary, even  essential, for consumers and producers  both.  the debate opens we  find  two  main proposals before us: One, S. 1715  would move  toward  a  decontrolled  market; the other, S. 996, would move  toward a more regulated market.  As different as these two proposals  are,  they  do  contain  common  ele ments. Both contain contract-carriage  provisions, both address take or pay,  both restrain indefinite price escala tors,  and both contain  a  prudence  standard to increase pipeline account ability. Mr. President, there is enough  common ground to forge an acceptable  compromise.  We must find a compromise  that:  First, resolves the major problems now  As  second, can command sufficient sup port in the Senate and in the country  to insure passage; and third, is not so  extreme as to provoke a filibuster by  distorting  the  natural  gas market;  those who feel most strongly on either  the producing side or the consuming  side. Some say this cannot be done. I  disagree.  At the appropriate time I will off er a  substitute and I ask unanimous con sent that my proposed substitute be  printed in the RECORD  following my  comments. This, like all evolving com promises is subject to further change.  It represents a statement of principles;  I am wide open to suggestions regard ing the details.  The substitute is a reasonable, bal anced compromise that contains ele ments common to both S. 996 and S.  1715. It benefits consumers while pro viding production  incentives for new  gas. It benefits producers without in creasing prices to consumers. How is  that possible?  The elements of my substitute are  these:  First. Take-or-pay relief-both S. 996  and S. 1715 provide some form of take or-pay relief for pipelines and their  customers. I would apply this relief at  50 percent for the first year, 50 per cent for the second, P.O percent for the  third, and 70 percent for the fourth  and fifth.  Second. Limits on indefinite price es calators-both S. 996 and S. 1715 pro vide some form of limitation on con tract clauses that contain price escala tors tied to oil or other commodities  that could cause gas prices  to  jump  dramatically on January 1,  1985.  I  would not allow these clauses to raise  prices above the December 31, 1984,  level plus  inflation.  I would outlaw  most-favored-nation clauses.  Third.  Pipeline  accountability again, both S. 996 and S. 1715 contain  some form of prudence standard that  seeks to make pipelines more sensitive  to market conditions as they purchase  gas. I would add ""imprudence"" to sec tion 601(c) of the NGPA, and require  pipelines to respond to market forces  and changes in customer demand.  Fourth. Contract carriage-both S.  996 and S. 1715 contain contract car riage that enables natural gas consum ers  to seek sources of supply other  than their traditional pipeline. I have  made several strengthening changes to  the contract carriage provisions of S.  1715;  these changes are described in  more detail below.  Fifth. New-new gas decontrol-my  amendment would  remove  the $3.50  price ceiling for never-be! ore-contract ed gas, new 102 gas;  this gas is now  selling in the market for about $3.00.  Sixth. Clarification of  the Presi dent's authority to reimpose price con trols-one effect of the Supreme Court  decision on the legislative veto  is to  allow the President to reimpose price  controls without  congressional  con sent. My amendment would require a  joint resolution to reimpose price con trols.  Seventh. Repeal of incremental pric ing and Fuel Use Act limitations as in  s. 1715.  Eighth.  Import provision-requires  imports to be responsive to changes in  customer demand  or other market  forces;  requires administrative action  on certain pending LNG importation  proceedings.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a section-by-section summa ry of my substitute be entered into the  RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the sum mary was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  BRADLEY SUBSTITUTE-SUMMARY OF MAJOR  PROVISIONS  TITLE I-TRANSITIONAL PRICE AND CONTRACT  PROVISIONS  Sec. 101. Take or Pay Relief. Provides five  year period for take or pay relief; pipelines  can use provision to reduce take or pay obli gations  to 50% of deliverability  the first  year, 50%  the second year, 60% the third  year and 70% the fourth and fifth years.  Volumes not  taken are  ""released"" and  may be sold to another purchaser at a de regulated price; reserves are protected.  Sec. 102. Transportation Obligation. Re quires pipelines exercising take or pay provi sion to transport the gas for a new purchas er.  Sec.  103.  Effect  of Certain Contract  Clauses. Limits the operation of indefinite  price escalator clauses, and prohibits oper ation of most favored nations clauses.  For gas deregulated on January 1, 1985,  the price could not fly above the December  31, 1984 price, plus inflation, due to the op eration of indefinite price escalator clauses.  TITLE  II-REMOVAL OF WELLHEAD PRICE CONTROLS OF NEW CONTRACTS AND REPEAL OF JU RISDICTION OVER CERTAIN FIRST SALES  Sec. 201. Removal of wellhead price con trol on new contracts. Deregulates ""new new"" <new 102> gas defined as gas not sub ject to a contract prior to the date of enact ment.  Sec. 202. Technical.  Sec. 203. Amendment of :.,rovisions allow ing  reimposition of price controls with a  joint Congressional resolution of approval.  Repeals sections 122, 123, and 507 of the  NGPA.  TITLE III-PIPELINE PRUDENCE STANDARD  Sec. 301. Inserts ""imprudence"" into Sec tion 60Hc> of the NGPA; requires that con tracts be responsive to changes in customer  demand or other market forces.  TITLE IV-CONTRACT CARRIER AUTHORIZATION  Sec. 401. Contract Carrier Authorization.  Contract  carriage  authorization  requires  interstate  pipelines,  intrastate  pipelines,  and local distribution companies to trans port natural gas for other purchasers.  Encourage voluntary  transportation  ar rangements in preference to mandatory con tract carriage.  Financial incentives for pipelines and local  distribution companies to participate in con tract carriage transportation are provided.  Same as sec. 401 of S. 1715 with the fol lowing amendments:  Defines available capacity in terms of ex isting  contracted  demand forecasts.  Prohibits discrimination in the provision  quantities  instead  of  of storage.  ",1983

1816,1051,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Chair, on behalf of the President pro  tempore, pursuant to Executive Order  No. 12169, dated October 26, 1979, ap points the Senator from New Jersey  <Mr. LAUTENBERG) to serve on the U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Council.  The new Argentine democracy under  Raul Alfonsin is not going to have an  easy time. The economy, with one of  the highest rates of inflation in the  world and with a $40 billion foreign  debt, presents an enormous problem.  The demands of  the people  for  a  better life than they had under the  military are going to seem overwhelm ing. Politically,  the  former military  rulers are going to be uneasy and ap prehensive about the policies of the ci vilians which are going to affect them.  One of the first issues the new civil ian government  is going  to have  to  confront is that which affects the Ar gentine  national  conscience-to  ac count for the thousands of dead and  disappeared and to punish those guilty  within  the military of  these crimes  against  the Argentine  people. The  military, a  few weeks ago, passed an  amnesty law absolving itself of respon sibility for acts committed during the  so-called dirty war of the 1970's, but  many prominent civilians,  including  President-elect Alfonsin have prom ised to challenge this. Argentine de mocracy will not  flourish until  the  families know if their loved ones have  died,  that  they  know  the  circum stances behind each death, and that  the guilty be brought to justice.  I note with  interest  that Augusto  Conte McDonnell, whom I met during  my visit to Argentina in February of  1981, has won a seat in the new Con gress. Within the democratic system  now, he will be able to continue his  work,  supported  by  colleagues  like  Emilio Mignone, with whom  I  also  met,  to  bring  justice back  to  the  people.  The task of President-elect Alfonsin  and other leaders is going to be a most  difficult and dangerous one because  the military is very sensitive about the  human rights issue. I hope that the  Argentine military,  those  farsighted  military  leaders who  cooperated  to  bring their nation to democracy again,  will cooperate in this national effort to  see  that  justice and  the Argentine  nation and people are served. I com mend the military's decision  to turn  power over to the civilians on Decem ber 10, 7 weeks earlier than scheduled.  This truly gives much hope for  the  future in Argentina.  ARGENTINE DEMOCRACY-A  NEW BEGINNING  ",1983
1817,1051,22,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, the people  of Argentina  cried out  loudly  and  clearly for democracy on October 30,  when they turned out in overwhelm ing numbers to elect a civilian Presi dent after 8 years of military  rule.  They were 8 difficult and trying years  for  the Argentine nation, especially  trying for the families who today still  feel  the personal anguish  resulting  from  the death or disappearance of  loved ones.  VETERANS DAY  ",1983
1818,1051,22,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President, this  Friday, November 11, is Veterans Day  1983. On that day the citizens of our  great Nation will pause and express  their gratitude to those who have sac rificed so much that this great Nation  may continue to enjoy the blessings of  freedom and liberty. What those val iant men who fought in World War l and all of our wars since then-have  done for us remains vivid in our minds.  It is appropriate that we set aside a  day such as this: A day to celebrate  the end of that war, the ""war to end  all wars,"" as a tribute to this Nation's  28.5 million  living veterans and  to  those who have gone on before.  It is particularly fitting, as we do  this,  to note that Veterans Day this  year falls in ""National Disabled Veter ans Week,"" a week set aside to pay a  special tribute to those veterans suf fering from disabilities incurred in the  service of their country.  Certainly there is no greater obliga tion on the part of a government than  to assure the defense of its citizenry  and def end its borders. And, as a con tinuing expense of that national self defense, a government is further obli gated in a broad variety of ways to  meet  the needs of  those who have  given up a portion of their life to fight  at the Nation's call. The obligation to  provide  compensation  to  those dis abled in the service of their country is  one that has always been recognized  as  the highest duty of  a  grateful  nation. The provision of high quality  health care such as is provided by our  Veterans' Administration through its  172 hospitals, its 226 outpatient clin ics, its 99 nursing homes and 15 domi ciliaries-both  to  those  disabled  in  service and, to the extent facilities are  available, to other veterans in need of  such care is unquestionable. The pro vision of a pension  to veterans dis abled, resulting not in the service of  their country, yet who are in financial  need,  is but another of the Nation's  commitments. The provision of a vari ety of benefits to assist in the rehabili tation of veterans or in their readjust ment to civilian life following service is  of particular import. And finally, the  provision of a dignified final resting  place, where our veterans are assem bled one last time as they enter eterni ty, constitutes our final and finest ob ligation  to  those  selfless men  and  women, who have given of themselves  that we may remain free.  As we commemorate Veterans Day  this week, it is particularly appropri ate that, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and  in behalf of its members, I pay par ticular credit  to our wartime veter ans-to those who gave much to our  Nation, fought for it, preserved it, and  made it great.  It is fitting at this time to briefly  review some of the legislative accom plishments of the Congress in behalf  of veterans during the preceding year.  It has  been  a  year  of  significant  achievement. Last Thursday, this body  passed  H.R.  2920,  the  Veterans'  Health Care Amendments of 1983, im proving  the quality, scope, and effi ciency of health-care services available  through the Veterans' Administration  to our veterans.

The gentleman from Alaska who, I  understand,  is  to be managing  this  issue is a little bit behind, because we  moved so quickly on the first  three  issues today.  I understand that he is en route to  the floor, and I do not wish to unduly  belabor this or to try to tie this up,  but I wonder if the gentleman from  Ohio could  tell us something about  the subcommittee action and commit tee action on  this bill, so  that  the  Members on this side might have some  understanding of what  the minority  attitude  toward  this  proposal  has  been.  I yield to the gentleman for his re sponse.  ",1983
1820,1064,22,Mr. SEIBERLING.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  At our subcommittee's hearing on  this bill, it was brought out that both  the Forest Service and the BLM have  adopted a policy of requiring the users  of these pre-Federal Land Policy and  Management Act irrigation systems to  obtain permits  and  have  gradually  made these permits more and more de tailed as to the terms and conditions  which the users are required to meet.  And in addition, they have taken the  view-the  administration  has-that  these pre-FLPMA  irrigation systems  are subject to the requirement of an  annual rental fee for the right-of-way,  and that they cannot be transferred  without the approval of the relevant  Secretary.  Since  continued validity of water  rights in many cases is dependent on  the continued availability of such irri gation ditches, obviously this require ment has aroused alarm and appre hension  that  individual  rights  are  threatened by confiscation by adminis trative fiat. As reported by the Interi or Committee, and there was no dis senting vote in the vote of the commit tee, H.R. 2982 simply offers the hold ers of these irrigation systems an op tional alternative to going to court to  require the Secretary to respect their  rights as granted under previous law.  That alternative does two things: It  unambiguously grants a  fee  right-of way across Federal lands for these pre existing systems when they are used  for agriculture, livestock, and private  domestic purposes, and it also details  the terms and conditions under which  that right-of-way can be used, and the  extent to which it will be subject to  Federal regulations to protect the en vironmental and other values of the  Federal lands involved and the public  interest and access to, and safe use of,  the land.  This will assure the users of these  systems,  if they choose  to  take this  option,  to continue  to use  them as  they have  in the past, while at the  same  time making  clear  that  the  Forest Service and BLM can properly  manage  the Federal  lands  involved,  and it does seem to me that that is de sirable. Otherwise, they are going to  be forced into court and we will have  all kinds of litigation, putting both the  Government and the users to consider able expense  for  rights  that we,  in  passing the Federal Land Policy and  Management Act, intended to be rec ognized. While this bill would not pre vent users from going to court if they  decide to go that route, it would estab lish an option which I think protects  both the Government's interests and  the private users' rights.  ",1983
1821,1064,22,Mr. MADIGAN., I thank the gentle man from Ohio for his very compre hensive explanation.  ,1983
1822,1064,22,Mr. KOGOVSEK.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1823,1064,22,Mr. MADIGAN., I yield to the gen tleman from Colorado.  ,1983
1824,1064,22,Mr. KOGOVSEK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of H.R.  2982  and  strongly urge my colleagues to join me  in passing this legislation through the  House. The bill is extremely important  to the people of the various Western  States because it deals with water con veyance systems for agricultural, live stock, and private domestic purposes.  As I am sure we will all agree, water is  one of the most important commod ities in the West. Yet, without a ditch,  flume,  pipeline or other system  to  convey the water from the source to  another point, it cannot be effectively  put to beneficial use. In essence, with out a conveyance system,  the water  would be meaningless.  I  introduced H.R. 2982  in order to  bring equity to the manner in which  the Federal Government was treating  rights-of-way for irrigation conveyance  systems constructed, and in operation,  prior to the enactment of the Federal  Land Management and Policy Act of  1976 <FLPMA). In the State of Colora do, for example, such fees were not im posed until recently. More important,  the Forest Service and Bureau of Land  Management have assumed FLPMA to  be an authorization  to  regulate  the  waters of the various States in which  such rights-of-way are necessary. This  is clearly a direct contradiction of the  intent of Congress.  Mr. Speaker, the irrigation convey ance  systems we  are  talking about  today may be categorized  into three  basic areas: First, systems established  under  the act of July 26,  1866  ( 43  U.S.C. 661) and the act of March 3,  1891  (43 U.S.C. 946); second, systems  constructed and in operation prior to  October  21,  1976  <enactment  of  FLPMA);  and  systems  constructed  after October 21, 1976 <enactment of  FLPMA). There is no question about  post FLPMA ditches, as they are re quired to be governed by FLPMA. In  addition, there should be no question  regarding ditches constructed under  the 1866 or 1891 acts, since a necessary  requirement for a water right to be ad judicated, or a permit to be issued, is  the actual construction of the ditch  and the granting of a right-of-way. In  essence,  any party,  in Colorado  at  least, who holds a water right and is  conveying such water across Federal  lands, must also have been granted a  right-of-way  for such purposes. The  principles of Western law hold that a  water right is not perfected until such  water has been put to beneficial use.  This cannot occur unless a  right-of way has been granted, as appropriate.  The question,  therefore,  is whether  rights-of-way  established under  the  acts of 1866 or 1891 carry with them  valid existing rights as those protected  under FLPMA. Clearly, the Commit tee on  Interior and  Insular Affairs  stated that they do hold such rights  and are protected by FLPMA.  It was my intent, when working with  the Interior Committee in drafting the  substitute amendment,  that the new  subsection  (c) would  apply only  to  those cases  that are voluntarily en tered into by the ditch owner. Thus, if  the owner decides not to participate in  the new provisions, he must establish  that his ditch is governed by another  act. The priority date of an adjudicat ed water right should determine which  act is applicable.  H.R. 2982 is a compromise bill which  has strong bipartisan support. It is a  ",1983
1825,1077,22,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, on July  29, our colleague, Bun SHUSTER, intro ducted H.R. 3720 cosponsored by the  Pennsylvania delegation, which would  name the Altoona, Pa., Veterans' Ad ministration Medical Center in honor  of former Congressman James E. Van  Zandt. I sponsored a similar bill, H.R.  2596. On May 12, 1983, Congressman  ROY ROWLAND  introduced H.R. 3012,  to name the Dublin, Ga., Veteran' Ad ministration Medical Center in honor  of the late Carl Vinson, a Member of  this body  for more  than 50  years.  These measures were combined  in a  clean bill, H.R. 4294, which was unani mously reported by the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs on November 3, 1983.  Mr.  Speaker,  James Van  Zandt  served in the Congress for 22 years. He  had a distinguished career with  the  U.S. Navy and was retired in 1959 with  the rank of real admiral <Reserve). He  served  three  times  as  the national  commander of the Veterans of Foreign  Wars, and is a member of the Ameri can Legion and the Veterans of World  War I. The members of the Pennsylva nia delegation, as well as all of the  major veterans' organizations,  have  endorsed  this measure. All  of  the  members of the Committee on Veter ans' Affairs are cosponsors.  It  is  a  modest, but distinctly apt, tribute to  Jimmie's 65 years of service to veter ans and their dependents to name this  VA medical center in his honor.  Mr. Speaker, I beleive that this is a  good bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support it. I would now like to yield to  my  colleague,  the Honorable Roy  ROWLAND,  for his comments on  the  provision in H.R. 4294 regarding Carl  Vinson.  ",1983
1826,1077,22,Mr. ROWLAND.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1827,1077,22,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, I yield to  my  colleague,  the Honorable Roy  ROWLAND,  for his comments on  the  provisions regarding Carl Vinson.  ",1983
1828,1077,22,Mr. ROWLAND.," I thank the gentle man and appreciate his yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think at this time,  when we have  in  the past  several  weeks experienced a great deal of diffi culty around the world, that our at tention is more acutely focused on our  military and on our veterans, and I  think it is an appropriate time for us  to consider renaming  these veterans  hospitals.  Mr. Speaker, at the request of nu merous VA organizations  in Georgia  and in behalf of all of the Members of  the Georgia delegation, I rise today to  speak for  this  legislation  to rename  the Veterans' Administration Medical  Center  in my hometown of Dublin,  Ga.,  in honor of the late Honorable  Carl Vinson.  Although he was  reelected  to  the  Congress from both the 6th and 10th  Congressional Districts. his home of  Milledgeville now rests in my own 8th  Congressional District.  Mr. Vinson distinguished his life in  many ways, but among the most well recognized is his record-setting term in  the House  of Representatives. For  over 50 years, he served in this body,  serving  under  nine  administrations.  Thirty of those years were spent as  chairman of the House Naval Affairs  Committee, now known as the House  Armed Services Committee.  Prior to his election to the Congress.  he was an attorney, a State represent ative, and a  judge. He was known al ternately as Uncle Carl,  the Swamp  Fox, Mr. Defense, and  the Admiral.  And as chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee, he became known  as the father of the modern two-ocean  Navy.  When asked about his keen interest  in the Navy, he responded that it was  our ability to protect the seas which  kept our land safe. In honor of his  concern of the Navy, he was to be the  first  living person  to have a major  Navy ship named after him.  During his years as chairman. his  philosophy for keeping order was  to  ""never let them all get mad at once.""  Apparently it worked. He earned the  respect of his  fell ow colleagues and  maintained his position.  He was successful in boosting mili tary pay. He was instrumental in get ting the Air Force to locate an air base  in Warner Robins-which abuts my  district. He fought for bonus pay for  our Nation's veterans. And most im portantly. through his able guidance  and strong  leadership, he  strength ened our defense.  On the keel of the aircraft carrier,  the U .S.S. Carl Vinson, is a quotation  taken from Mr. Vinson. ""No person  representing  the  American  people  should ever place the defense of this  Nation below any other priority.""  Mr. Vinson surpassed his own credo  in his efforts  to guide our Nation  toward military independence.  Although he often stated that he did  not  like  to  reminisce,  certainly he  would not begrudge us the opportuni ty to pay tribute to him by renaming  the Dublin VA Medical Center  the  ""Carl Vinson Memorial Veterans Ad ministration Medical Center.""  ",1983
1829,1077,22,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker. in sum mary, let me indicate that these two  bills combined in H.R. 4294 are a deep  tribute to two men who have served  their country well.  The Carl Vinson naming of the hos pital in Dublin, Ga., is an honorable  action for this House to take, and the  naming of  the hospital  in Altoona  after James E. Van Zandt is an impor tant action for us.  D 1420  I would  like  to commend my col league, the gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr. SHUSTER), who worked very  hard on this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Mem bers of  the House will support  this  bill.  ",1983
1830,1077,22,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker. I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  H.R. 4294. This bill would honor two  very distinguished former Members of  this  body  by  having VA  hospitals  named after them. The hospital in Al toona, Pa., would become the James E.  Van Zandt Veterans' Administration  Medical Center and  the hospital  in  Dublin, Ga., would become  the Carl  Vinson Veterans' Administration Med ical Center.  Mr. Speaker,  former Congressman  Van Zandt  is  personally known  to  many of us. His record of service to  the Na ti on in war and peace is a most  enviable one. He is a veteran of three  wars, rising from an enlisted status in  the U.S. Navy in World War I  to the  rank of rear admiral in the Naval Re serve following his active duty during  the Korean conflict. He came to Con gress  in 1938 and served until 1943  when he resigned to go on active duty  in World War II. Following his dis charge he was again elected to Con gress and served until 1963.  Mr. Van Zandt was always a champi on of veterans. He was elected three  times as national commander of the  Veterans of Foreign Wars and is an  active member of several other veter ans organizations. While in Congress  he served on the House Veterans' Af fairs Committee,  the House Armed  Services Committee,  the Committee  on Naval Affairs, and was the ranking  member of  the Joint Committee on  Atomic Energy during its early days.  He is a tireless worker in many fields  and is a respected and beloved veter ans' leader whose name will add luster  to the VA hospital in Altoona. Pa.  Mr. Speaker, Carl Vinson's name is  legend in this body. He served in Con gress longer than anyone else. He was  known far and wide as ""Mr. Defense.""  The United States was  in four wars  during his tenure here. All during that  time, Mr. Vinson was  a  visionary  leader who understood  this Nation's  role in the world. He understood more  than most the need for a strong na tional defense, and he spent a lifetime  of service to his country leading de fense  efforts The Dublin, Ga., VA  Medical Center will  gain  increased  stature by having his name enshrined  upon its walls.  Mr. Speaker.  the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee  has  very  strict  rules about recommending that veter ans' hospitals be named after individ uals. The most cogent rule  requires  that  the  individual be  truly distin guished. Jimmy Van Zandt and Carl  Vinson meet this test in every way and  ",1983
1831,1090,22,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, con sideration of the continuing resolution  is always a low point in Congress budg etary respectability.  Programs  which  would  not  be  funded through the regular appropri ating  process  can  obtain  funding  through  the  continuing  resolution  process. It is an easy vehicle for pro viding money  for  questionable pro grams.  Continuing resolutions prevent any  chance of budgetary restraint. They  sidestep  the budget process and the  normal legislation process. They dis count the value of budget work and  normal  appropriations  work  done  throughout  the  year. When  the  budget resolutions are as excessive as  is the fiscal year 1984 budget, funding  through continuing resolutions is even  worse.  House Joint Resolution 403 is a par ticularly bad continuing resolution be cause  the  rule  for  its consideration  provides for five add-on amendments.  The amendment process  today pro vides a  carnival  for budget add-ons  which are not affordable and are not  sufficiently considered. It would be a  nice play if we were not spending real  taxpayers' dollars.  The majority leader has a blatantly  irresponsible  amendment  to  today's  bill. He and his friends lambast the administration for the enormous deficits,  yet  they add another $1 billion for  programs that have a good sound to  some constituencies but are already  well funded. The amendment unf ortu nately places concerns of the Ameri can constituency at large at great risk.  His amendment would reverse much  of the progress which was made in the  1981 reconciliation and appears to be  designed primarily  to embarass  the  President.  Continuing  resolutions  are  bad  enough when  they  are  clean. This  dirty one deserves to fail. Our deficit is  bad enough already.e  ",1983
1832,1090,22,Mr.  FISH.," Mr. Chairman,  I voted  today against the rule on the continu ing  resolution,  along with my  col league from New York, BEN GILMAN,  because we wished to off er an amend ment to House Joint Resolution 403.  The modified closed rule prevented us  from doing so.  Mr. Chairman,  there are 19 small  cities  throughout  the United States  which have been adversely affected by  losing their designation as a ""central  city"" for purposes of entitlement fund ing under the Department of Housing  and Urban Development's small cities  community  development  program.  One of these cities is in my congres sional district, and one is in Congress man GILMAN's district.  Loss of central city status would be  devastating  to our cities, Newburgh  and Middletown. There  is no doubt  that these cities need  these entitle ment  funds, nor  that  they  serve a  large population of low-and moderate income people. Although the HUD ap propriations provides funding in fiscal  year 1984 for these cities, they will no  longer be eligible in fiscal year 1985  without further action by  the Con gress. H.R. 1 provides that a central  city would maintain  its entitlement  status if at least 75 percent of its com munity development block grant funds  were used to directly benefit lowor  moderate-income  people.  However,  H.R. 1 is still in conference, and the  grandfathering  provisions  of  the  House and Senate housing and com munity  development  bills  differ  in  terms of  the  length of  time during  which the central cities would main tain their entitlement.  Mr. Chairman, these cities are clear ly in need of these community devel opment funds. Mr. GILMAN and I do  not believe  it was  the intent of the  Congress  to  penalize municipalities  which fall below arbitrary criteria. At  a recent meeting on this matter, OMB  was asked  to  revise  its criteria and  definitions for central cities, and the  Census Bureau promised  to consider  updated  figures  on population  and  commutation.  In the interim, we believe that our  cities should continue to be funded as  they have prior  to  the 1980 census  until  these  issues are  resolved. Our  amendment would have read as fol lows:  Notwithstanding any other provision of  law, any unit of general local government  qualifying as a metropolitan city described  in section 102<a><4><A> of the Housing and  Community Development Act of 1974 for  purposes of assistance under section 106 of  such Act for fiscal year 1983 shall qualify as  such a city for purposes of such assistance  for each succeeding fiscal year, unless such  unit of general local government is deter mined to not qualify as such a city on the  basis of data obtained in a census conducted  after the date of the enactment of this Act  under section 141 of Title 13, United States  Code.  and  Mr. Chairman, the other cities af fected by  the elimination of entitle ment funds for central cities are:  Cape Coral and Cocoa, Fla.  West Lafayette, Ind.  Muskegon Heights, Norton Shores,  and Portage, Mich.  Moss Point, Miss.  Asbury  Park,  Long Branch,  Sayresville, N.J.  Concord and Salisbury, N.C.  San Benito, Orange, and Pharr, Tex.  Colonial Heights and Hopewell, Va.  I  urge my  colleagues  from  these  cities  to  support  our  amendment,  which we will offer to the supplemen tal appropriation or which will be of fered as part of the conference report  on H.R. 1 in the Senate.e   ",1983
1833,1090,22,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Chairman, at the  time the House considered the rule to  the  continuing  resolution,  I  voted  against the rule, because the Congress man from New York <Mr. FISH) and I  had intended to off er an amendment  to House Joint Resolution 403. Unfor tunately, the modified closed rule re ported by the Rules Committee pre vented us from doing so.  As my  colleague  from New York  stated,  there are 19 cities that have  lost  their  designation  as  ""central  cities."" These communities will  lose  much needed HUD small cities com munity development funds because of  arbitrary eligibility criteria. Because  the continuing resolution provides no  mechanism  for  us  to  consider  the  problem  being  experienced  by  the  cities or Middletown and Newburgh, as  well as the 17 other municipalities, we  intend to off er an amendment to the  supplemental appropriations bill. At  that time, we intend to solicit the sup port of the membership of this body in  correcting the misdesignation of these  cities and urge your support at that  time.  We  have been working with  the  Senate on this matter, and hope that  H.R. 1, the housing authorization bill,  will be a viable vehicle for arresting  this problem. However, Mr. Chairman,  regardless of which measure contains  our amendment, I urge my colleagues  to assist us with this amendment, and  to support its adoption.e  ",1983

I am particularly interested in the  increases  proposed  in  funding  for  handicapped education and for alien  education. These are both unusually  worthy programs, which provide sig nificant social benefits for relatively  little spending. It is a shame that we  have lost sight of the great value such  programs have to this society as  in vestments  in our future. Any  fu:.1ds  spent on educating the handicapped,  new immigrants, or children of disad vantaged  families  is  returned many  times over in the social and economic  benefits of having  them participate  fully in our economy.  As a Member from California, where  so many newly arrived immigrants and  refugees have  settled,  I  know  from  personal experience how useful and  productive these programs can be.  What we are talking about today is  not excessive or wasteful spending. We  are talking about thoughtful and con sidered  investments.  It  is  certainly  true that spending money in and of  itself does not guarantee quality edu cation. But no one has ever shown me  how refusing to spend money would  improve our educational system.  We must not lose sight of our funda mental goal of providing children with  a quality education. We must not fail  in our responsibilities.  I congratulate the sponsors of this  amendment  for  their  leadership on  this issue, and I urge the adoption of  the amendment. Thank you.  ",1983

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of  the Wright amendment and  would like to say that the funds that  are requested in this proposal are nec essary and reasonable.  The significant budget cuts in vari ous social and educational programs  experienced  over  the  past  several  years have had a  tremendous impact  on the lives of millions of Americans  who depend on these valuable social  services.  While we often make mistakes, we  are a nation of compassionate men  and women.  Mr. Chairman, it is obvious that we  have made a mistake in cutting many  of  the  programs  that  affect  the  hungry, the homeless, the elderly, the  sick,  the disadvantaged, women, stu dents, and the jobless in this country.  The amendment being offered today  to the continuing appropriations reso lution does not pretend to solve all of  the problems that we are confronted  with but the impact of those recent  budget cuts have created many, many  problems and I think that this amend ment that is offered by the majority  leader certainly will go a long way in  trying  to solve some of  those problems.  vious budget cuts and that the ground work must be laid for correcting these  inequities  that have  resulted  in the  budget cuts over the recent years and  in supporting the Wright amendment,  I  should note  that  the Ways  and  Means Subcommittee on Public Assist ance and Unemployment Compensa tion which I chair has been involved in  the low-income energy assistance pro gram for quite some time.  I know that there are 16 other pro grams  that will be affected by  this  amendment and  that  is why  I  call  upon my colleagues  to support  the  Wright amendment.  We have shared in my subcommittee  some jurisdiction in the development  of this program with the energy assist ance for those who are not able to pay  the high cost of utilities, and, Mr.  Chairman, with that I urge my col leagues to join with me and give full  support  for  the Wright amendment  and adopt their amendment today.

1871,1259,22,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, it is a  great privilege  for me  to  recognize  Clinton Lyons, who will be honored on  November 9 by the Rutgers University  Law School Alumni Association. He is  a man who has served the legal profes sion with distinction, who has worked  his entire career to further the rights  of low-income people in our Nation's  courtrooms.  Clint presently serves as executive  director of the National Legal Aid and  Def ender Association, an organization  of poverty lawyers which has been in  the forefront of the fight to preserve  the Federal Legal Services Corpora tion. He came  to  that position  this  year after having worked at the LSC  during a most turbulent time.  Clint has been involved in the deliv ery of legal services to the poor since  his  graduation  from Rutgers  Law  School, first as a staff attorney with  the Essex County Legal Services Pro gram, and eventually as the director of  legal services programs in Newark and  then in Georgia. In 1978, he came to  LSC's Washington  headquarters  to  direct  the Office of Field Services  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  until 1982, when he was appointed  Acting Vice President and then Acting  President. This was  a  challenge  to  Clint's administrative and  leadership  skills, one that he met most admira bly. His management of the Corpora tion during this time earned him the  widespread respect of the legal serv ices community as well as many of  President Reagan's appointees to the  Corporation's Board of Directors.  Clint has demonstrated the sort of  commitment and dedication that make  the  legal profession proud  to count  him as a member, and I take personal  pride  in  the fact  that he began his  career in New Jersey. For the contri butions he made to my home commu nity and to our national legal services  program, I salute Clint Lyons on this  well-deserved honor.e  A NEW TYPE OF SUPERHERO  HON.AUGUSTUSF.HAWKINS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 8, 1983  e ",1983
1872,1259,22,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, Dr.  James Mays, a Los Angeles cardiolo gist and the creator of the fictional  black superhero Radian, recently set  into motion an  imaginative plan  to  assist families in need. I would like to  submit to the RECORD an article pub lished by the Los Angeles Herald Ex aminer which further details this in novative community program.  The article follows:  [From the Los Angeles Herald Examiner]  BLACK PROFESSIONALS BEGIN PROGRAM TO  ADOPT FAMILIES  <By Miles Beller)  Two years ago a black superhero named  ""Radian"" burst upon the world.  The brainchild of Los Angeles cardiologist  James Mays, Radian was a muscular do gooder created to inspire black youth who  were lacking outsized fantasy figures.  Now, in an effort to further spur aspira tions of local black youngsters and perhaps  turn wishful fantasy into a bit of hard reali ty, Mays and several other area black pro fessionals such as lawyer Lawrence Grigsby,  accountant Earl Harris,  nutritionist  Iris  Brown, and pharmacy owners Tracy Love lace and Eugene Wheeler have put together  a  new  self-help program called Adopt-A Family Endowment.  Under terms of the pilot program, Mays  and the other professionals will be provid ing free services to the McNeese familya  family of 14 who reside in South Los Ange les and now are entirely supported by feder al, state and county welfare funds.  ""We are the first generation of successful  black people,"" Mays explained yesterday, a  day before this morning's press conference  held at the McNeese residence to formally  announce  the program's launching.  ""And  we're showing them 'you are a step away  from where I am.' ""  Mays went on to say that while ""you can  have fantasy figures such as Radian for the  children,""  it is equally important  to show  black youngsters  that ""we do have  black  31631  heroes in the community"" such as postmen,  doctors and lawyers.  Consequently, Mays noted, one of the pro gram's main goals it to ""have black profes sionals interact with the family, and hope fully serve as a motivating factor.""  Mays also noted that a far-reaching goal  of the program is to ""redirect"" those who  are apt ""to step out of a  restaurant and  point a gun at your head.''  In addition to the professionals offering  skills and services free of charge, Mays said  that $200 would be given to the McNeeses  each month for the next year.  ""We'll be giving them a $200-a-month en dowment,"" Mays pointed out,  adding he  thought that the money would probably be  budgeted for food.  Though  the McN eeses will be  the first  fainily to be helped by the Adopt-A-Family  program, Mays said there is undoubtedly no  shortage of black families needing such as sistance.  By the end of this year's program, Mays  said, he hopes there will be no shortage of  black professionals who had volunteered  their services and time to the program.  As to how the McNeeses came to be select ed to be the program's first family, Mays  said they literally came to him.  ""It just so happened that the family came  into my office,"" he commented. ""And there  they were ... all lined up like ducks on a  pond.''  ""Well, I was a patient there,"" recounted  James McNeese, when asked how his family  came to be chosen. McNeese, 43, broke both  hips and suffered permanent spinal damage  when he was 16 years old and fell from a  truck while catching sacks of cotton.  Eventually,  the  entire McNeese  became Mays' patients.  In putting into words the hopes he has for  what the Adopt-A-Family program can ac complish. NcNeese said that paramount for  him was encouraging the children to strive  for better grades and instilling in them the  will to ""look forward to the future.''  ""I didn't get the chance to go to school,""  he noted. ""I had to stop at the 10th grade  and go to work.''  At the moment, NcNeese  is particularly  concerned about the education of his two  eldest  daughters, Willie  Jean,  19,  and  Tammie, 18. Both girls are mothers out-of wedlock who dropped out of school, later re turning to high school and graduating with  honors this year.  ""Willie Jean wants to go into computers  and Tammie wants  to be a nurse,"" noted  McNeese. And he trusts that the program  will help his children attain this goal.  As far as the program's long-term benefits  go, McNeese hopes it will provide ""a better  life for all-even after the year is up.''  More prosaic concerns for NcNeese now  include  finding  roomier  lodgings  for his  brood. ""We need a large place,"" he said of  the  three-bedroom  apartment  on  58th  Place, just off Slauson Avenue and Hoover  Street, that he rents for $650 monthly.  ""Now the kids are all sharing bedrooms.  My wife, Essie, and I are sharing our bed room with two children.''  Though keenly aware of the considerable  problems his  family now  faces-problems  the Adopt-A-Family program will try in the  next  12  months  to  alleviate-McNeese  knows his plight is not unique.

DAN MICA  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 8, 1983   ",1983
1874,1272,22,Mr. MICA.," Mr.  Speaker,  as  a  member of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee for  the past 5 years,  I have  been supportive of efforts to promote  and  uphold  democratic  institutions  throughout  the world. With  this  in  mind,  it  is with great pleasure and  pride that I today introduce a concur rent  resolution  congratulating  the  nation of Argentina for the successful  conduct of elections held on October  30, 1983.  The success of this election should  not be underestimated. The people of  Argentina came out  in full  force  to  vote for their candidates-over 80 per cent of those eligible to vote cast bal lots in the election. In a nation of over  29 million,  these statistics are com mendable.  Moreover,  the elections were con ducted  in  a  free  and  democratic  manner, with no  illegal domestic or  foreign interference. The party of Dr.  Raul Alfonsin received 52 percent of  the ballots, a clear and decisive victo ry. Dr. Alfonsin's civilian government  has been encouraged by the Argentina  military establishment  to  take over  the strings of Government 1 month  earlier  than  had  previously  been  planned. The new government is ex pected to  take control December 10,  1983.  The United States looks forward to  establishing a  flourishing and enduring relationship with the newly elect ed civilian government of Argentina. I  hope that my colleagues will join me  in congratulating the people of ArgenEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tina on the success of their elections  and  in  commending  the Argentina  military for their wisdom in promoting  the smooth succession to power of the  new civilian government of Argentina  lead by Dr. Raul Alfonsin.e  IN DEFENSE OF GRENADA  ACTION  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 8, 1983  As   ",1983
1875,1272,22,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, I have  just returned from a joyous ceremony  in  the Rose Garden at  the White  House where President Reagan deliv ered the official ""welcome home"" to  the estimated 700 American medical  students safely rescued from Grenada  2 weeks ago.  As I have stated before, the military  action taken by the United States was  entirely justified considering the very  real threat which was posed to each of  these American students. The memory  of the Embassy takeover in Iran and  the 12-month hostage nightmare had  to figure in the planning of the Ameri can military.  the President  indicated  in his  speech this morning, the White House  has been  inundated with  telegrams  and letters of thanks from returned  students and their families. The fact  that American forces are being with drawn on a daily basis and real hope  exists  that  they may be all out by  Christmas firmly establishes the credi bility of the President about the Gre nada mission being a rescue mission as  compared to an invasion.  It was a great sight to see both the  students  and  the military  together  this morning with the Commander in  Chief presiding.  It was an occasion  where patriotism replaced politics.  I  was proud to be there and proud to be  an American on this important day.e  THE FAILURE OF AMERICAN  BUSINESS MANAGERS  HON. RICHARD L. OTTINGER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 8, 1983  e ",1983
1876,1272,22,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues  attention an op-ed piece recently pub lished in the New York Times on the  state of productivity in the U.S. work place. The author, Seymor Melman, is  a professor of industrial engineering at  Columbia University. Mr. Melman  argues  that  the management  tier,  which has been taught to make money  not goods, has contributed toward the  declining  competitiveness  of Ameri can-produced goods not only in inter national markets, but in the United  November 8, 1983  States as well. The step this country  must take to rebuild its industrial base  and restore the competitiveness of its  goods is to invite the workers, who ac tually design and build the products,  to participate  in the decisionmaking  within the company.  I urge my col league to read this article:  MANAGERS'I>EBACLE  <By Seymour Melman)  From left to right, policy proposals for in dustrial renewal share a core assumption:  that American managers as a group are in terested in and capable of restoring compe tence in production. This assumption, once  unchallengeable, is obsolete.  A  generation  of managers  has  been  trained by our business schools  to make  money, not goods. Gripped by  a  dogma  called ""management science,""  the schools  have played an important institutional role  in the erosion of competence for production.  Until recently, American managers were  the world's best organizers of  industrial  work. That was  the basis of their profits  and their claim to large personal  income.  The managers performed a vital function:  To live, a community. must produce.  For two centuries, a tacit understanding, a  social contract, has been in force. In return  for  its decisionmaking power and wealth,  management was expected by society to or ganize work. The legitimacy of that contract  rarely has been challenged.  American  industry's productiveness and  all-around competence was a source of na tional pride. Whatever the criticism, man agement was perceived as fully interested in  and able to organize production, the source  of wealth. No one doubted that investing in  and efficiently operating the means of pro duction, especially those of basic industry,  was  the high  road  to wealth,  fame and  power.  In the last 25 years, management's social  contract with workers and the community  has been broken as managers have turned  from making goods  to making money by  means other than production. The result of  this transformation  in management's pro fessional imperatives is visible in the disso lution of production competence  in once great industries. These industries have been  managed by persons  increasingly oriented  toward profits by financial strategems, com modity speculation and fast-return  invest ments, finally striving for profits without  the burdens of any production at all.  At the same time, a state-managed mili tary economy, guided by costand subsidy maximizing,  is precisely the reverse of in dustrial efficiency. But it is a moneymaker  and power base for everyone involved in it.  A firm's failure once enabled more compe tent management to take over production  and marketing positions. Not any more. As  managers' competence in making goods be comes  increasingly  rare,  and  ploys  for  making money dominate,  industrial decay  spreads. Top managers in remote central of fices leave entire communities and regions  economically stranded. Imported goods re place American goods. Jobs in producing oc cupations are severely reduced, hardly af fected by the trickle of new work in high tech industries.  Meanwhile,  business  schools  rationalize  the collapse of entire industries with facile  explanations about post-industrialized socie ty,  sunset and sunrise  industries,  service  economies, subsidized imports, Government  ",1983
1877,1285,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Yes.  Mr. McCLURE.  I  appreciate  the  statement the Senator from Kansas  has made.  I hope everyone knows I  have been pressing  this matter  for  weeks to get it resolved, and it is still  my intention to get it resolved before  we adjourn-the sooner the better as  far as I am concerned. But the majori ty  leader does have other problems  that he has to deal with. While this is  primary to the Senator and to me at  this  particular  time,  the majority  leader has other things that he must  be concerned with, and I have to yield  to that from time to time. If we are  not able to get to the resolution of this  matter today, I will be pressing him  continuously, as I have been for weeks  now, to make it an urgent priority in  the list of things that must be done  before we adjourn this session of the  Congress. I still will make every effort  toward that end.  ",1983
1878,1285,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Will the Sena tor from Idaho yield for a question,  recognizing full well that the Senator  from Louisiana still holds the floor?  Mr. McCLURE. If the Senator from  Lousiana will yield for that purpose  without losing his right to the floor, I  would be happy to.  ",1983
1879,1285,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  Is  there any  reason why we could not enter into an  agreement with  time  limits with re spect to, as the Senator from Kansas  has suggested,  a  4-hour  time  limit,  with respect to votes on both 996 and  1715, both as second-degree amend ments, and enter into the agreement  without actually locking in place when  that 4 hours would expire or even nec essarily when  the vote would  take  place? At least we would have provided  that conclusion.  I might say parenthetically that I  cannot see that the world is going to  fall apart, nor even the country, if the  Treasury appropriations bill does not  come to the floor. As a matter of fact,  I am told that there are two highly  controversial  amendments  that  are  being talked about for that measure  which would make passage of it utter ly impossible. So I would think that  when we are on this bill which means  so much to the country and is so im portant  to  those who want  to heat  their homes this winter and the indus tries  that  operate  thereunder, we  ought to come to an agreement now,  and then we can decide where we find  the timeslot and also the time when  we vote.  I  Mr. McCLURE. Mr.  President,  I  would be pleased to respond to that, if  the Senator from Louisiana will yield  without losing his right to the floor.  ",1983
1880,1285,22,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr. President,  yield the floor.  ",1983
1881,1285,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Idaho is recognized.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I am  happy to respond to the Senator from  Ohio. I just look around. While there  are six Members of the Senate within  sight, maybe more within sound, that  means there are 94 who are not, and a  unanimous-consent  agreement  re quires  unanimous  consent.  That  means  that  every Member  of  the  Senate has to have the opportunity to  be contacted. There have to be clear ance procedures on both sides of the  aisle.  ",1983
1882,1285,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.," If we come to  an agreement, then we will see to it  that there are hotlines put out of that  effect on both sides. But I  think we  can come to an agreement on the floor  subject to it being cleared all around.  Mr. McCLURE. As I indicated earli er, I will attempt to do what I can to  see what we can do.  I am prepared  right now to enter into a unanimous consent agreement on the Kassebaum  amendment. I am not at the present  time prepared to enter into a unani mous-consent agreement with respect  to a vote on S. 1715 as a second-degree  amendment. However, I am not fore closing that possibility. I think that is  a possibility. But as I say, if everyone  within view  and within earshot of  what we are discussing  is willing to  enter into such an agreement with re spect to the Kassebaum amendment, I  am ready. I have been seeking that for  some days now. I think every Member  of the Senate has been on notice that  we are trying to get that done, and I  hope that we can, before we move off  this  bill,  get  a  unanimous-consent  agreement with respect to the Kasse baum amendment.  ",1983
1883,1285,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.," We are talking  also about S. 1715, because I think it  would only be fair to say that a vote  on the Kassebaum amendment alone,  of which I am a cosponsor, would not  really  indicate where  the  Senate  stands.  Mr. McCLURE. I understand that a  vote on the Kassebaum amendment,  unless it is adopted, is not the final  word.  I suspect that even if it were  adopted, there would be efforts made  to further amend it. I do not seek to  foreclose that possibility by whatever  agreement we might enter into.  ",1983
1884,1285,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., Will the Sena tor from Idaho yield?  Mr. McCLURE. I would be happy to  yield without losing my right to the  floor.  ,1983
1885,1285,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," I fully appreci ate how the Senator from Idaho, the  chairman of the committee, is trying  to move this legislation. He has given  extraordinary effort, not only to the  hearings and the markup but to push  the  legislation on  the  floor.  I  say,  though, if we are able to work out a  unanimous-consent agreement  for  a  shortened period of time, I wish the  committee would feel that they could  do the same on 1715, because much  debate has already occurred on 1715 in  the  earlier  debate  regarding  the  motion to proceed.  Mr. McCLURE. I understand what  the Senator from Kansas is saying. As  I said before, we have discussed the  question of bringing the Kassebaum  amendment to the floor under a time  agreement openly  and publicly  for  days. It was about the first comment I  made when I  took the floor, as the  motion to proceed to the consideration  of  this matter became  the pending  business, indicating that that was my  intention, and that intention has been  widely disseminated. I think everyone  knows what that issue is.  The Senator from Ohio some time  ago  raised the possibility of S. 1715  being  offered  as  a  second-degree  amendment, and while that was done,  I do not believe, at least within my  knowledge, it has been as widely dis cussed as a procedural possibility as  has the desire of the committee, of  myself at least, to move to the consid eration of the Kassebaum amendment  at an early time. However, I have not  foreclosed  the possibility of S. 1715  being  offered  as  a  second-degree  amendment, and I am actively explor ing that possibility. But I am not in a  position to say right now that I am  able to enter into a unanimous consent  agreement on that matter.  ",1983
1886,1285,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," One  of  the  things that changed, however, is that  our time has been somewhat constrict ed.  Mr. McCLURE. Yes.  ",1983
1887,1285,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., If we had the  leisure of the whole week-and we can  talk about moving this to next week we all know that our plate is very full  as far as what we have to handle next  week before we go out.  Mr. McCLURE. That is correct.  ,1983
1888,1285,22,Mrs. KASSEBAUM., And so I think  we should be under no illusions that  time is going to be better next week  than it is right at this moment when I  do think we have a window of 4 hours.  Mr. McCLURE. I do not think we  have a window of 4 hours.  ,1983
1889,1285,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Would  the  Senator be willing if we had a window  of 3 hours, 2 hours, 1112 hours? What  did we come here for today? Just to  withdraw  the Senator's amendment?  Let us get the show on the road. Let  us vote.  Mr. McCLURE. The Senator, in all  candor, put his finger on it. One of the  major purposes was  to do what has  been done, but that is not the sole pur pose.  ",1983
1890,1311,22,Mr. BIDEN., I yield the floor  Mr. DOMENIC! and Mr. DOLE ad dressed the Chair.  ,1983
1891,1311,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New Mexico  is  recog nized.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  will take just a moment.  I wish to tell the Senate why I am  involved. Obviously, I am not on the  committee of jurisdiction, but I come  from a State that is over 30 percent  Hispanic and needless to say they are  genuinely worried about the fact we  are not going to have a Civil Rights  Commission.  Further, it should be noted that my  State with reference to civil rights is  about as progressive as any  in  the  country and yet my Hispanic people  are very concerned that we will go  backward  instead of continuing for ward. We have many people there very  familiar with what  the Commission  has done, its successes, and they are  very concerned we come up with some thing that keeps it alive.  In other words, the stalemate is not  good enough in this case. We have to  do something, and I thank the Sena tors for letting me participate today  and yesterday.  I offered the sugges tions I could and talked with people in  my State who are rather expert. I wish  to thank the Senator from Kansas for  permitting us to help him and work  with him, and I compliment the Sena tor from Pennsylvania for getting the  issue here, and I hope we get a bill  today. Whatever it is, I think we will  leave this Chamber tonight convinced  that we started something that has a  chance of putting  this Commission  back in business.  I  agree with  the  Senator  from  Kansas. I do not think a purely legisla tive commission is the best approach. I  say to my good friend from Pennsylva nia that I do not think he does either.  Obviously he had no other alternative  at the time he moved in that direction.  Maybe one that is partly legislative  and partly executive if it has a little of  both is the solution.  I also am concerned if it is purely  legislative whether it really will have  the powers that are necessary.  There are some subpena powers that  have been  tremendously  important.  They have to be used judiciously, but  they have to be valid and operative. I  have not studied  the  issue, but my  recollection of the law would indicate  that  there are problems  if it  is  a  purely legislative commission which it  would be without the Executive ever  having signed it. The problems include  subpena power and the like to carry  out the functions.  So I am more than willing to contin ue to help where I can, and I  thank  the Senator for the opportunity.  ",1983
1892,1311,22,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  if the  Senator will yield on one point, I wish  to make it clear that is the legislative  approach that the Senator from Penn sylvania and I are supporting there is  no question there would be subpena  power.  I  agree with  the Senator  that  it  would be nice to have the administra tion counted in, and I think it would  be a good idea. But there is subpena  power.  I  compliment  the Senator on his  continuing concern for the American  Hispanic community. That is why we  have been meeting  for  the  last 5  months with the leaders of the two  major groups representing the Hispan ic organization.  ",1983
1893,1311,22,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  I  shall  just take one moment because I know  Senator HATCH, who has primary juris dication, is here and has been waiting  to speak, and I would just say this:  The one problem, of course, we have  when we get into this time of the year  is how long we are going to be around  here.  It just takes one Senator to walk  over here and say, ""This bill  is not  going to pass."" That is all it take  at  this point.  I assume the majority leader then is  under some compulsion  to establish  priorities of where does  this belong  and should it be up here for 3 or 4  days. We have to move  to the debt  ceiling, reconciliation, the continuing  resolution, and  three of  four other  must  items-hopefully budget reduc tion, deficit reduction, and that may  not be quite as easy.  But, in any event, I hope that all  those who have an interest in trying to  resolve this problem-I know of no one  in this Chamber who does not want to  see a continuation of the Civil Rights  Commission. And  it ought  to be as4  strong as we can make it.  Therefore, I think there ought to be  shared authority by the President and  by the Congress. To do any less, in my  view, even though I think the Senator  from Pennsylvania and others have  done what they had to do when it ap peared there was going to be no Com mission at all, is not to fill the breach  as they have done.  I  hope  that  the  administration's  views can be reconciled with the views  of other Senators who have a slightly  different approach and with members  of  the Leadership Conference  and  other civil rights groups.  I would be very pleased to work with  other Senators in trying to put that  together between now and tomorrow  morning.  ",1983
1894,1311,22,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I rise  in strong support of the amendment  of the Senator from Pennsylvania.  For several months  the Judiciary  Committee has struggled to save the  Civil Rights Commission.  ",1983
1895,1324,22,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  today  Senator HAWKINS and I are pleased to  introduce ""The Dependent Care Re sources and Referral Act of 1983.""  This  legislation  provides  interested  States with a one-time grant to devel op means of providing families with in formation on dependent care services  within their own communities.  Despite  the  social  and  economic  forces which foster change in our con temporary family structure, a  recent  national survey revealed that a good  family  life remains  the No. 1 social  value for Americans, ranking in our  national hierarchy of values  above  physical health, self esteem, and free dom of choice.  One of the most dramatic changes  for both the family and for the civil ian work force was  the entrance of  women into the labor market in un precedented numbers. Labor participa tion by women has doubled since 1930.  Currently, 52 percent of all working  aged women are employed. Additional ly, there are approximately 10 million  American  families maintained solely  by women.  These women face continuing eco nomic stress. Women who are single  heads of households because of di vorce have an initial 29 percent loss of  income after the divorce, and after a  year their income has dropped 73 per cent. Other single heads of households  face similar economic stress.  In the face of these shifting econom ic  and  social  realities and with  so  many parents working, there emerges  the central question: Who takes care  of  our  children while  the  family  works?  In 1947, only 19 percent of women  with children worked. Today 53 per cent of all children in  this country  have mothers in the job market. News week cited that ""In 1980, 45 percent of  mothers with preschool children were  working at jobs away from home, up  fourfold from three decades before.""  That affects about 7 .5 million infants  and toddlers. Therefore, the need for  child care for the children of working  parents has greatly increased over the  past 20 years and is expected to con tinue into the 1990's. More mothers  are entering the work force than ever,  and more  are  remaining  at wbrk  during their child-rearing years. For  many single parents of small children,  child care services enabling the parent  to work are a necessity.  But the caring does not end when  the children are raised and on their  own. Many American  families  are  faced with difficult choices when older  family members become ill or incapaci tated.  ",1983
1896,1363,22,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to talk just a little bit about  the dairy votes that are coming up  today. There  is one  important vote  and that is on the Conable amend ment of which Members really ought  to be very, very much aware.  First of all, we must remember that  the goals that were established for the  dairy industry by this House were to  get the cost of the program under con trol and to get production under con trol.  There is no question but that the  compromise does that, saves $1 billion,  and is the only one that will get our  surplus under control.  But, most  importantly  remember  that  if  the  Conable  amendment  passes, it will work by culling farmers  as well as cows.  D 1100  Thirty-thousand producers will go  out of business-most of them young  farmers-if  the Conable amendment  passes.  The compromise says: Let us give  them a chance,  let us give  them a  chance  to survive. For the next 15  months,  let us  see  if  those higher  grain prices will take care of the situa tion. If it does not, then they will have  to accept the support-price cuts; they  have come forward and said they will  do that.  In the interim, they are willing to  contribute money  to create, for  the  first time, a farmer-paid incentive pro gram to get the situation under con trol.  The choice is clear: Do you want to  give 30,000 farmers a chance to sur vive? Or, do you want them to go out  of business next year?  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE  YOUR CONSUMERS BY H.R. 4102  <Mr. RITTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1897,1363,22,Mr. RITTER.," Mr. Speaker, we will  be  considering  the  telephone  bill  shortly, which is not 4102, it is 4295, a  recent major change being made  in  the bill on the way to the Rules Com mittee and not considered in subcommittee, not considered in full commit tee. The change involves a substantial  revision of the section which taxes by passers in the existing long distance  lines. Inserted without any debate of  any kind. A last minute adjustment to  avoid referral to Ways and Means.  But let me just point out the big  myth here; the myth is that this bill,  recently 4295,  is going to keep  tele phone rates down; that, in response to  all the letters you are getting from  your consumers you can write back  and say, ""See, I kept your rates down  by implementing this legislation.""  Well, that is simply not true. The  fact  is your average  telephone .bills  around the country are about $30 per  month and the fact is that the local  service charges are only a small por tion of  this and your  long distance  charges are a portion of this; and with  an increase of several dollars over a  few years in local service rates and a  reduction of several dollars for long  distance calls you are talking about a  virtual wash.  Those rates are determined by a lot  of other things and they are probably  going to go up. Only a strongly com petitive high growth, telecommunica tions  industry, with rational  regula tion at the State and Federal level will  keep prices down. You are not going to  save your consumers by 4102  come  4295. This bill has the kind of reregu late, new tax features which can only  increase consumer costs.  PRESIDENT TAKES TOUGH  POSITION WITH JAPANESE  <Mr. REGULA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1898,1363,22,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I read  with great interest this morning a wire  service story from Tokyo. The story  pointed out that the President, while  we anticipated that he was going on a  friendly ceremonial mission, is getting  much tougher on the issue of trade  and defense contribution by the Japa nese.  Larry Speakes the Press Secretary is  quoted as saying that ""the President is  going to preach peace and prosperity.""  It is clear that he  is  talking about  peace with more defense effort from  the Japanese Government and pros perity that looks to a redress of the  imbalance in the $20 billion trade defi cit between ourselves and the Japa nese.  It points out in the wire service story  that Prime Minister Nakasone and the  President had what is called a frank  discussion. Now that is polite language  for disagreement.  The trade issue is simply that the  Japanese Government should open up  its markets to American products; the  President clearly is telling their lead ership that fact. Likewise, the President is reported in this wire service  story as addressing the problem of the  dollar /yen relationship.  I am pleased that President Reagan  is  taking a  tough position with the  leaders of Japan on those  issues of  greater contribution to defense and re dressing the trade imbalance.  RECHECK YOUR FACTS ON  AT&T  <Mr. WISE asked and was given per mission  to address  the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1983
1899,1363,22,Mr. WISE.," Mr. Speaker,  this  is a  continuation of AT&T fables.  I  just  thought I would take care of a couple  of them right now.  A lot of the Members have been lob bied, as I have, talked to about interre gional transfers. They said my State  was losing $3 million. Using AT&T's  statistics  from  the  Interstate Com merce  Commission,  I  found  that  indeed West Virginia is a net gainer of  $5 million.  So we have dismissed that. Those of  you who have been told you are losing  money  through  interregional  trans fers,  I urge you  to check with  the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Another Member, another lobbyist  for the industry came by and told me  that the Communications Workers of  America were getting off the bill, they  were no longer interested in it. After  contacting them, I  learned that they  are firmly in support of the bill.  I was also told, for instance, that a  major  telecommunications  company  supporting the bill had withdrawn its  support. I contacted them today and,  of course, that is not the case either.  It greatly concerns me when one of  the giants, one of the greatest giants  in  the  telecommunications  industry  fails to communicate directly, itself.  I urge you, those of you who have  been contacted by AT&T, to check the  facts you have been given; check with  the Committee on Energy and Com merce.  Finally, let me just say that in calcu lating the figures, I hope that AT&T  will not be calculating our  long-dis tance bills on  the same calculators  that  they have been  lobbying Con gress with.

1914,1389,22,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman, pur suant  to  the  resolution,  I offer an  amendment in the nature of a substi tute.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment in the nature of a substitute  offered by Mr. CONABLE: Strike out all after  the enacting clause and insert in lieu there of the following:  That this Act may be cited as the ""Dairy  Adjustment and Stabilization Act of 1983.""  SEc. 2. Section 201 of the Agricultural Act  of 1949 <7 U.S.C. 1446), as amended by the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982,  is amended, effective sixty days after enact ment, by<1> deleting subsection Cd> thereof; and  <2> amending subsection Cc> to read as fol lows:  ""Cc> The price of milk shall be supported,  through purchases of milk and the products  of milk, at such level not less than $11.60  per hundredweight as the Secretary deter mines necessary in order to assure an ade quate supply of milk to meet current needs  and taking into consideration the net price support purchases of milk or the products  of milk by the Commodity Credit Corpora tion during the preceding fiscal year. The  support price shall be established annually  by the Secretary at the beginning of each  fiscal year."".  ",1983
1915,1402,22,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania <Mr. MCDADE).  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the so-called dairy com promise, H.R. 4196, the Dairy Produc tion Stabilization Production Act of  1983. The dairy surplus  is a  serious  problem, and while  the compromise  does not please everybody, I do believe  it is our best option to address the sit uation we face.  The compromise takes the best parts  of the price cut and supply manage ment  proposals.  The  temporary,  farmer-financed  diversion  program  will move to reduce the surplus quick ly, and with a minimal displacement of  dairy farmers as possible.  In addition, the Secretary of Agricul ture will still retain the discretion to  lower the price support of $13.10 per  hundredweight  to  a  level  down  to  $11.60 per hundredweight to further  manage dairy supplies.  The compromise allows dairy farm ers to continue to operate, while pro viding price signals that may be neces sary  to discourage excessive produc tion in the future.  One of my  real  concerns  in  the  supply management approach is that,  while it may quickly reduce produc tion, there would be no assurance that  production would not rebound after  the 15-month diversion program ends.  The addition of giving the Secretary  of Agriculture  those necessary price  control mechanisms may prevent a  return to the overproduction.  When compared to the approach of fered by my good friend, the gentle man from New York, BARBER CONABLE,  the compromise is a better bill, better  for the consumer, better for the Fed eral budget, and better for the dairy  farmer. According  to published  re ports, the compromise bill will cost the  Federal Government some $1.27 bil lion less than the Conable approach.  Both bills would have similar effects  on consumer prices, both bills give the  Secretary  of Agriculture  the  same  price signals mechanisms necessary to  control the supply. Its just that the  compromise  reduces  the  supply  of  dairy products through the price di version and as a  result, Government  expenditures on behalf of the dairy  price support program should fall con siderably. The compromise is project ed to reduce outlays to less than one half of what was spent in fiscal year  1983. The key is that the compromise  bill is the legislation that most quickly  and effectively cuts the production of  dairy supply.  I  thank the gentleman for yielding  and urge support for  the dairy bill  before us today.  ",1983
1916,1402,22,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. LEWIS).  ",1983
1917,1402,22,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Conable amendment. This amend ment would cost the Government over  $1 billion more than the compromise  bill. Consumers' benefits of the Con able amendment will not materialize.  Historically, very little, if any, of the  savings from a support price reduction  have found their way to the consum ers.  This year Florida farm milk prices  dropped by  95  cents per hundred weight. Yet, the retail price remained  the same. Not one cent of the savings  was passed on to the consumer.  While  the Conable amendment by  lowering milk price supports provides  just as much incentive, as does the bill  for farmers  to slaughter their dairy  cows,  the Conable amendment pro vides no orderly procedure for market ing the slaughtered stock.  Recently, I met with more than 150  dairymen in my district. To some of  them, passage of a  dairy bill  is  a  matter of survival.  Stick with  the  compromise  and  def eat the Conable amendment. It cer tainly will not do the job.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  ",1983

1919,1402,22,Mr. HUCKABY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Conable amendment and I would  like to echo what the gentleman from  Florida said. For many dairy farmers  throughout  the Nation,  passage of  some bill, either alternative  is abso lutely necessary for their survival.  I would suggest  to my colleagues  that the committee version, the com promise, has the far greater chance of  becoming law. I also support the com promise and am opposed to the Con able  amendment  for  this  simple  reason: The Conable amendment re duces the price supports. It is going to  take years to force farmers into bank ruptcy and to reduce the output sig nificantly.  However,  the committee bill pays  farmers not to produce. There will be  a large participation, but CBO tells us  that even though we are paying farm ers not to produce, we will save money  because we will have  to buy signifi cantly less surplus milk, and hence, I  think, this is the best approach and I  urge my colleagues to vote with the  committee.

1924,1402,22,Mr. FRENZEL.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the  amendment  of  the  gentleman  from New York <Mr. CONABLE).  I am not a dairy expert. I do not rep resent some dairy interests.  My understanding is that both com peting ideas have the same purposes to reduce surpluses and not increase  deficits.  Under the terms of amendment of  the gentleman from New York,  the  producers in my area say they will in crease production and  increase  sur pluses. That is not progress.  At the same time, the deficit in the  next 2 fiscal years is going to be three quarters of  a  billion dollars  larger  under the Conable amendment. That  is not progress either.  If you want to go backward, if you  do not like progress, then I submit you  should support  the Conable amend ment.  Otherwise, vote, as I shall, for the  committee's compromise.  ",1983
1925,1402,22,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina <Mr. CLARKE).  D 1450  ",1983
1926,1402,22,Mr. CLARKE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Conable amendment.  I am a dairyman and I represent a  lot of the North Carolina dairymen,  all of whom want the Conable amend ment.  The real problem we are discussing  is how to reduce the enormous surplus  of milk in this country. The diversion  program contained in the compromise  bill simply will not do it. The loss of  cash flow created by the heavy assess ment is already causing some dairies  to increase production.  Some dairies will sell out entirely,  thereby putting heavy pressure on  beef prices. A few dairies would cut back enough to qualify for the $10 per  hundredweight payment, but I suspect  that a  lot of them would hold back  their heifers for freshening at the end  of the 15-month period covered by the  bill.  The final result of the compromise  would be almost no net decrease  in  milk production. And  the proposed  costly advertising program would not  do much, if anything, to increase milk  sales. Similar advertising and promo tion programs are already in operation  in many parts of the country with lim ited success.  The only way we can achieve a real  decrease in milk production is to cut  the  support  price  as  the Conable  amendment provides up to $1.50 per  hundredweight. This will  cost  the  Government less in the long run and it  will get dairying back on a sound basis.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support the Conable substitute. It is  a way to get rid of the dairy surplus. If  ",1983

The SPEAKER. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Iowa?  There was no objection.  ",1983
1933,1415,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am not going to take  very much  time.  This  conference  report was reported out a week ago.  We had hoped to get it on the floor  last Thursday, but we were asked to  delay,  so  the Members  have  had  plenty of time to read the conference  report. I will cover a few of the high lights, however, by saying  that the  conference report contains a  total of  $10,499,665,000 for fiscal year 1984 in  budget authority.  The amount agreed to for 1984  is  $256,927 ,000 more than the appropria tions made for these programs in fiscal  year 1983. It is $473,347,000 more than  the total amount requested for fiscal  year 1984, and the total is $99,323,000  more than the Senate bill. The confer ence report is $191,535,000  less than  the bill that was reported by the com mittee to the House.  We have provided funding for some  items that were not in the original  House-reported bill, for example, the  new criminal  justice assistance pro gram. However, I have been informed  by the administration that if the bill  passes in its present form,  they will  have no objection. If that is so, we will  have the first bill signed into law for  these departments and agencies in 4  years.  I hope that is the case and, there fore, I hope that no amendments are  made to this report. It is a very fragile  combination. The Senate gave up,  I  think, more than what the House gave  up, but we arrived at what we believe  to be a bill that everyone can support.  Certainly we  thought we had  that  when we left the conference commit tee.  So I  think the Members should be  pleased with the way we took care of  this matter,  and  I  hope  that no  amendments are adopted.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con sent  to  insert at  this point  in  the  RECORD a summary table showing by  department or agency the conference  action compared with  the amounts  provided in fiscal year 1983 and the  budget estimates for 1984, the House  bill and the Senate bill.  The SPEAKER. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Iowa?  There was no objection.  The summary table follows:  ",1983
1934,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  should have men tioned at the beginning that this has  been a long and arduous process. We  started on this bill last spring. We had  many, many days of meetings and  hearings. We finally got the bill out in  May in very good time. We were ready  to go to the floor in June. We were  held up due  to problems with  the  Committee on Rules and with other  problems. A large share of the bill has  not been authorized by the authoriz ing  committees  but,  on  the other  hand,  those committees all felt that  these programs needed to be funded.  So we are in a very different position  of trying to fund things that have not  been authorized and we do not like to  do that. But we could not do anything  other than that. It held us up until  the end of the fiscal year. We did fi nally get the bill passed in the House  in September. I want at this time to  comment that the gentleman from Illi nois <Mr. O'BRIBN) and the Members  on that side of the aisle and the Mem bers on this side of the aisle, all of  them have been very valuable contrib utors to the product we have today.  The staff and all of the members of  the subcommittee deserve a great deal,  of thanks for having made it possible  to get this bill this far this year.  ",1983
1935,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",1983
1936,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa., I yield to the  gentleman from Connecticut.  ,1983
1937,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.," I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter  into a colloquy with the chairman of  the Appropriations Subcommittee to  clarify some of the details of the pro visions of the bill as reported by the  conference committee relating to the  Legal Services Corporation.  I would  ask the chairman:  The conference report contains an  allocation formula based on the goal  of moving  toward  equalization  of  grants for programs in all parts of the  country according to the number of  poor people as determined by the 1980  census.  I would  just  like  to clarify  what that formula is and how it works.  As I understand it, under that for mula, local field programs as a group  will receive the same proportion of the  total Legal Services Corporation ap propriation in fiscal year 1984 as the  group did in fiscal year 1983, and this  total will be distributed among  the  local programs in two steps: each to re ceive first an amount 5 percent higher  than it received in fiscal year 1983 or  an amount equal  to $6.50 per poor  person in its geographical area under  the 1980 census, whichever is higher;  and second, the remainder of the total  to be distributed among them accord ing to the equal percentage by which  each program's funding as determined  after the first step falls below $13 per  poor person under the 1980 census.  I wonder if the chairman could con firm that that is correct.  ",1983
1938,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," That, I believe,  is correct. As  the gentleman knows,  some areas of the country got started  well ahead of other areas in providing  legal services to the poor.  D 1700  They built up substantial programs  when other areas of the country had  nothing. So several years ago we re quired what amounts to what we hope  will be access eventually. We said:  Before you give any more to those who al ready have more than minimum access, be  sure to build up these other areas of the  country.  will  Now all areas of the country for the  last 2 years would have had at least  minimum access to legal services if we  had been able to maintain the funding  at $321 million. They really do not  have minimum access now since the  funding was cut to $241 million.  But the purpose of the formula here  was to try to build up the smaller pro grams and give some recognition  to  the fact that they had not had any in crease last year or this year. That is  the 5-percent  increase, which  really  will not replace the cost of inflation,  but at least it will give them a small  increase.  ",1983
1939,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker,  if  the gentleman will  yield further, as I understand it, this  allocation  formula  determine  funding for  local  field programs re gardless of whether the current recess appointed members of the Legal Serv ices Corporation Board have been re placed by Board members confirmed  by the Senate?  ",1983
1940,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa., Yes. That is in  the conference agreement.  ,1983
1941,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Moving further, Mr. Speaker, there is  a circumstance in this funding formu la, as I understand it, which will go  into effect only if there is not a con firmed board prior to January 1, 1984,  and I would just like to review with  the gentleman the effect of that, if I  might.  As I understand it, the conference  report  contains  a  provision  under  which each grantee and contractor of  the Legal Services Corporation, under  section 1006(a) (1) and (3) of the Legal  Services Corporation Act whose fund ing is not prescribed by the allocation  formula set forth above will receive  total annual funding for  fiscal year  1984  in the same proportion to the  total Legal Services Corporation ap propriation that it received  in fiscal  year 1983 unless other action is taken  prior to January l, 1984, by a majority  of directors, each of whom has been  confirmed by the Senate, and that de spite a similar provision in the current  continuing resolution, the Corporation  has taken some action against some  programs which would not be consist ent with this provision because this is  intended  to preserve funding unless  and until there is a confirmed board.  ",1983
1942,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa.," Yes. Unfortu nately, Mr. Speaker, we had to deal  with a contingency which none of us  like, and that is the possibility that  there may not be a confirmed board. If  there  is a  confirmed board, certain  things will take care of themselves.  We tried to take care of what will  happen  if  there  is not a confirmed  board so we will know definitely what  will happen. I might say that on the  Senate side it was worked out. It is a  very delicate matter, but it was worked  out over there by both those who are  opposed to and who are for the Legal  Services Corporation. This  is what  they felt was a fair disposition of the  funding that was provided.  ",1983
1943,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.," So,  importantly,  if  there  is not a  con firmed board before January l, 1984,  or if such a board does not take action  before  January  1,  1984,  programs  funded under each of the sections I  have referred to, 1006 (a)(l) and (a)(3),  must be maintained at proportional  funding levels?  ",1983
1944,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of Iowa., That would be  so.  ,1983
1945,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker,  if  the gentleman will  yield further, I have three other areas  I would like to explore briefly.  First, with respect to class actions,  the conference report tracks the cur rent law as set forth in the current  continuing resolution on the bringing  of class action suits against Federal,  State, or  local governments, except  that it authorizes a majority of the  Legal Service Corporation Board, each  of whom has been confirmed by the  Senate,  to  establish  procedural  re quirements for commencing such ac tions. However, as I understand this  provision, the authority to impose pro cedural requirements is not to be used  to prohibit or unduly hinder the bring ing of class actions in circumstances  dictated by standards of professional  responsibility  of  the  attorneys  in volved.  ",1983
1946,1428,22,Mr. SMITH of  Iowa.," Yes,  that  is  right. And again I want to say that  this is one of those delicate matters.  As the gentleman knows, we have had  a lot of arguments on both the Senate  and the House side on this matter, but  what we came up with seemed to be  something that satisfies those on both  sides of the issue as much as can possi ble be done.  ",1983
1947,1428,22,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker,  if the gentleman will  also contains a new provision which  places time limits on hearings for de funding, suspensions for more than 30  days, or denial of refunding, and it  yield further,  the conference report  ",1983
1948,1441,22,Mr. BROYHILL.," Mr. Speaker, I urge  the Members  to  support  the argu ments  that have been put  forward  here by the gentleman from Georgia,  in opposition to the motion of the gen tleman from Iowa.  What we  are  talking about here  really is  the Federal Trade Commis sion authorization bill. This agency  has not been authorized in some time.  There is an authorization bill that is  languishing in the Rules Committee.  It has several provisions  in  it  that  have been requested by Members who  are  listening  to  this debate  tonight  and have  talked  to me  personally  about. We see no incentive for this au thorization bill being considered in the  House if this motion is adopted, be cause if the language of this appro priation goes forward, what incentive  is there to adopt an authorization bill  at all? There is no incentive.  There are a number of areas and  issues which Members have talked to  me about. For example, Members have  talked to me about the issue of the  FTC becoming involved in the regula tion of the professions. We have lan guage in this bill that would deal with  that  issue. A provision  in  the bill  would put some  limitations on  the  Federal Trade Commission's authority  to regulate the professions.  There are those of you who have  spoken to me about the fact that the  Federal Trade Commission has either  attempted or has written trade regula tion rules without adequate review or  without  adequate  knowledge  that  there has been a prevalence of the  particular practices they are attempt ing to regulate.  We have language in the authoriza tion bill that prohibits the Commis sion from initiating a rulemaking pro ceeding where isolated or insignificant  violations have occurred. They have to  go after them on a case-by-case basis,  instead of issuing a rule.  0 1840  In other words, the Commission has  to have reason to believe that a pat tern of unlawful conduct  exists  in  order to write rules that apply gener ally to the industry.  There are a number of other amend ments to the bill that are needed. We  see no incentive for this bill coming to  the floor of the House, unless we vote  down  the  gentleman's amendment.  This will then permit the gentleman  from Georgia to offer an amendment  that would say no new  rulemaking  until such time that an authorization  bill is passed.  The Levitas motion is not going to  affect any ongoing rulemaking activi ty. All it prohibits is the issuance of  final rules by the FTC until the au thorization bill is enacted. This does  not affect in any way the other au thorities of the agency. The agency  would still be able to issue cease and  desist orders and to carry out all of  their responsibilities under the law.  Without  this change  that we are  proposing, we see little or no incentive  to move the FTC authorization bill to  the  floor. But with  this  proposed  change  that we are proposing here  today, there would be great incentive  then to move the authorization bill to  the floor.  With  the  time  restraints  that we  have this session, we feel it is neces sary  to  provide  this  incentive  for  prompt action on the FTC authoriza tion bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",1983

1950,1441,22,Mr. FLORIO.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  motion of the gentleman from Iowa,  and oppose any effort to restrict the  Federal Trade Commission that goes  beyond the restrictions contained in  the Senate bill.  The effort to stop the internal work ings of the FTC in processing rules is  one such proposal as apparently  is  going to be offered, if the opportunity  presents  itself, would be an attack  upon the independence of the agency.

1953,1467,22,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Penn sylvania <Mr. RITTER).  ",1983
1954,1467,22,Mr. RITTER.," The gentleman from  Iowa <Mr. TAUKE) mentioned when he  was in the well that we had the great est  telephone system  in  the United  States, and I am sure that both sides  of the aisle, Democrats and Republi cans, are seeking to retain that tele phone system.  But this bill has become highly po liticized. You can talk with people in  the aisles, or in the halls, and find out  that whereas they may think the bill  is a turkey, they are boxed in.  Why basically is this bill flawed? It  is flawed because it takes one existing  system,  particularly  long-distance  communications,  and  says  to  that  system ""Thou shalt subsidize the rest  of the system, the local service.''  Some people have  said  that  the  beneficiaries are going to be the little  people,  the poor people, minorities,  perhaps.  I would like to quote from MICKEY  LELAND who in a colloquy with Charles  Brown, the chairman of the board of  AT&T, said that minorities use long distance telephones more than the av erage user. A study done by Urban De cision Systems shows that blacks and  Hispanics in 22 urban centers and low income centers had a long-distance bill  of approximately $29, while the aver age long-distance bill was $18.  So that is not a good argument.  What this bill does is promote the  technologies which attempt to bypass  the system without paying  the  tax.  The portion of  the bill which was  added went from a capability of inter acting with the exchanges of long dis tance to a self certification.  I submit that that is a very substan tive change. But somehow that worked  its way into the bill on the way to the  Rules Committee.  This was never discussed, never de bated in committee, never debated in  subcommittee, and somehow we are  finding ourselves strapped with it here  on the floor.  If we want to be the leading techno logical nation in the world in telecom munications, we will not place massive  taxes on certain kinds of technologies  and allow free rides for others. We will  not hamstring the development of our  telecommunications.  ",1983

1959,1493,22,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to insert my Washington  report for Wednesday, November 9,  1983 into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  CONGRESSIONAL TRAVEL  Foreign travel is a privilege of members of  Congress which raises doubts among con stituents.  We are all aware of the abuses that attend  some trips taken by members of Congress to  faraway  places  at  government  expense.  Frustration is the natural response of hard working, tax-paying constituents when they  see members flying off to Fiji to inspect in stallations,  signing up before  they  even  know a  trip's purpose, or using the plush  Air Force fleet maintained for ""official gov ernment  travel."" Last year, 232 members  traveled overseas at public expense, costing  Congress $4 million and the Defense and  State Departments millions more.  Opponents of congressional travel contend  that these trips waste government money,  allow members of Congress to mix too much  pleasure with official business, give rise to  heavy demands on American embassy per sonnel, and cause embarrassment abroad.  Also, it is difficult to look at the itineraries  of congressional  trips without concluding  that some are simply ""junkets"" taken more  for pleasure than for legislative reasons.  However, we should not overlook the ben eficial impact many trips have. For exam ple, many members of Congress  recently  have been traveling to El Salvador to get a  firsthand view of  fighting  there. Several  have reported that their experiences help  them understand better the complex situa tion in Central America and,  in some  in stances, change completely  their view of  what our policy in Central America should  be. Other trips have saved millions of tax payer dollars by resulting lower foreign aid  or  defense  recommendations  and  have  helped  focus world  attention on human  rights violations. Members, who do not rep resent the administration, many times can  say things a diplomat cannot say, and every  president and secretary of state in recent  years has thought congressional travel valu able. Supporters of travel note that tax-fa vored ""junkets"" by American businessmen  may be far more costly  to the Treasury,  that other nations encourage foreign travel  by their legislators, that Congress must be  represented at parliamentarians' meetings  abroad, and that the alternative to govern ment-financed travel for members is travel  paid by special interests.  Given the strength of the arguments on  both sides, the question is not whether to  abolish congressional travel but how to get  rid of frivolous travel while maintaining the  worthwhile. In the past, Congress has taken  several steps  to  try  to  tighten  its proce dures. Full reporting  to apporpriate con gressional committees began  in 1954, and  public  reporting  in  the  Congressional  Record commenced in 1959. The number of  House committees able to spend funds for  foreign travel was sharply limited in 1963,  and  in 1977 both  the House and Senate  adopted rules forbidding post-election ""lame  duck"" travel by members who are not re turning to Congress. A member cannot rush  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  off on a  ""junket"" with a  ""blank check""  whenever he wishes. The trip must be au thorized by  the congressional  leadership  and committee, or an executive request, and  vouchers submitted to verify expenses, usu ally only $75 of which may be covered by an  official daily  stipend. Given  the cost of  travel, members frequently pay additional  expenses from personal funds.  All foreign  travel  is not bad, and steps  should be  taken  to  facilitate worthwhile  travel. First, members of Congress returning  from trips should publicize the benefits and  accomplishments of  the  trip  to Congress  and their states and districts-showing the  positive side of such travel instead of hoping  it goes unnoticed. Second, members who do  not take trips should be scrutinized just as  members who travel are scrutinized. An ap propriate question to a member professing  to have a knowledgeable position on a ques tion of foreign policy is whether he has vis ited the area to observe  things up close.  Third, delegations should invite the press  along on trips. Rather than keeping itiner aries from the press and fueling suspicions  that too many extras have been included,  we should open up the trips to show how  fruitful they are.  Additional restrictions should be consid ered. First, congressional delegations should  be prevented from using military transpor tation  when  less-expensive  commercial  transportation would be adequate. Second,  the size of a delegation should be restricted  to the number of members that can be justi fied by the trip's stated purpose. Third, offi cial spending on trips should not be allowed  to exceed the amount allotted to members  in the form of daily stipends. Fourth, there  should be some form of ""peer review"" to  pass on the legislative relevance of  trips.  Fifth, members should be discouraged from  taking trips during the session after they  announce retirement or are defeated in a  primary election. Finally, increased public  disclosure  of  trips  in  the Congressional  Record and  in  formal committee  reports  should be mandated. Making members fully  accountable for the public funds they spend  abroad is the surest way to end abuse.e  NATIONAL  SCIENCE  FOUNDA TION OUTLINES PROGRAM TO  IMPROVE  PRECOLLEGE  SCI ENCE AND MATH EDUCATION  HON. DOUG WALGREN  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 9, 1983  e ",1983
1960,1493,22,Mr.  WALGREN.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  much-needed attention  recently has  been focused upon the serious prob lems that exist in science and mathe matics education in this country. In its  annual review of the National Science  Foundation's budget,  the Committee  on Science  and Technology  for  a  number of years has urged more em phasis on science and engineering edu cation; and earlier this year the Sci ence Committee and the Committee  on Education and Labor developed  H.R. 1310, a bill to improve math, sci ence, and engineering education and  teacher training. The House promptly  passed the bill on March 2;  it is dis31865  heartening that the Senate has not  acted now for 8 months.  To address these issues, the National  Science Board-NSF's policymaking  body-established in 1982 its Commis sion on Precollege Education in Math ematics, Science and Technology. The  Commission's report, with recommen dations, was released this September.  Also, NSF reestablished its Directorate  on Science and Engineering Educa tion, as announced on September 28,  1983,  by NSF Director Edward A.  Knapp.  Dr. Knapp met with the National  Science Board on October 20, 1983, to  outline NSF's program to improve sci ence and math education in the Na tion's  elementary  and  secondary  schools. I would like to share with my  colleagues the text of an NSF press re lease on Dr. Knapp's report  to  the  Board. I hope that Congress will see,  in the fiscal year 1985 NSF budget re quest from the Reagan administration,  a reflection of Dr. Knapp's statements  supporting an aggressive NSF program  to  improve science and math educa tion.  The information follows:  NSB Is PRESENTED NSF PROGRAM To  IM PROVE PRECOLLEGE SCIENCE AND MATH EDU CATION  A National Science Foundation <NSF)  report, presented to the National Science  Board <NSB> Thursday <October 20), out lined major components of an NSF program  designed to improve the science and mathe matics education of the Nation's elementary  and secondary school students.  The NSB is the policymaking body of the  Foundation.  The report, prepared at the direction of  Dr. Edward A. Knapp, Director of NSF, said  the activities focused on the precollege area  were research on and development of in structional materials in science and mathe matics for students and teachers; programs  to provide incentives for teachers and devel op their capabilities; and special programs  aimed at  increasing  informal science and  mathematics education, expanding dissemi nation  of  information  about  successful  projects, and monitoring the state of science  and mathematics education.  The key goal of the fiscal 1984 precollege  activities, the report stated, was the same as  that expressed recently by the NSB Com mission on Precollege Education in Mathe matics, Science and Technology. That goal  is to strengthen by 1995 precollege science  and mathematics education so as  to "". . .  provide all the Nation's youth with a level  of education  in mathematics, science and  technology,  as measured by achievement  scores and participation levels <as well as  other non-subjective criteria),  that is not  only the highest quality attained anywhere  in the world but also reflects the particular  and peculiar needs of our Nation.""  The report noted that achieving this goal  would produce three practical advantages:  better preparation of students  for wider  career choices; better preparation of stu dents for living in a high-technology, infor mation society; and an increase in the pool  of students adequately  trained  to pursue  college  and  university  opportunities  in  mathematics, science, and technology.  ",1983
1961,1519,22,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, the U.S.  action in Grenada to rescue American  citizens and restore democracy has re ceived broad support throughout the  United States. A recent bipartisan del egation  of our  colleagues  returned  with the clear conviction that Presi dent Reagan was right to send U.S.  forces to the tiny island, in response to  the request of our eastern Caribbean  allies.  Perhaps the time has come for some  of our other allies to rethink their ini tial lack of support for the President's  decision, and focus  instead on what  might be done to prevent future Marx ist  takeovers  in  the Caribbean and  elsewhere in the world.  Sir Philip Goodhart  is  a British  Member of Parliament and  former  Under Secretary of State at the Minis try of Defense under Mrs. Thatcher. A  recent New York Ti.mes editorial, mini mizing the threat Grenada's occupiers  posed to other free, small States in the  hemisphere, provoked Sir Philip to re spond. He graciously provided me a  copy of his letter to the editor, which I  would  like  to  share with my  col leagues.  He observes that, lacking adequate  defense, small States are almost as  vulnerable to hostile ""hijackings"" as  airlines are; and  that what was at  stake in Grenada was not just an air field or a Soviet/Cuban arms depot,  but the very safety of the other mini States of the region.  I would like to second his hope ""that  the British  and American Govern ments can join with those Caribbean  States that feel the need for protec tion in discussing together the ground  rules  for sensible defense  insurance  agreements  to  provide  the  smaller  States with some protection against  the threat of random assaults.""  Mr. Speaker, I insert the full text of  Sir Philip's letter in the RECORD:  London SWIA OAA, October 31, 1983.  HOUSE OF COIDIONS,  The EDITOR,  The New York Timu,  New York. N.Y.  Sm: In the past twenty years, Great Brit ain has given full independence to nearly  twenty mini-States-some with a population  of less  than 100,000-which cannot make  31891  adequate provision for their own defence.  Indeed, it is arguable that these very small  countries should not even try to maintain  armed  forces of any size, as  this would  absorb too much of the scarce resources at  their command.  The absence of adequate defences means  that these mini-States are almost as vulner able to hi-jacking as airliners are. Within  the British Commonwealth in the last six  years, the Governments of Grenada and the  Seychelles were successfully hi jacked by  armed forces  that were not much  larger  than a regular army platoon, while the at tempted hi-jacking of the Gambia was pre vented by  the  fortuitous presence of  a  couple of British Special Air Service soldiers  followed by the intervention of the Senegal ese Army.  It is not surprising,  therefore,  that the  mini-States of the Eastern Caribbean, such  as Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent,  should have asked my country and  the  United States  to  intervene  following  the  second coup in Grenada. What was at stake  was not just ""another Caribbean airfield, an  auxiliary station for smallarms transfers  and a modest source of new recruits for  international mischief"", as you suggest in  your leading article, ""America as Goliath""  <October 30), but the safety of other mini States.  As a British Member of Parliament and as  a former Under Secretary of State at the  Ministry of Defence under Mrs. Thatcher, I  am sorry that my Government did not feel  able  to  join with  the United States and  some of our Caribbean Commonwealth part ners in providing a relief force. The Prime  Minister of Barbados and his colleagues un derstood that failure to act in Grenada after  the recent murders would have greatly in creased the chances of similar assaults in  other islands.  The French have generally concluded de fence agreements with their former colonies  which have provided the independent Fran cophone States with a measure of protec tion  against  casual  assault. Perhaps we  should learn from the French.  When the Grenada operation is complet ed, and when diplomatic tensions have been  reduced, I hope that the British and Ameri can Governments can join with those Carib bean States that feel the need for protec tion, in discussing together the ground rules  for sensible defence ensurance agreements,  to provide the smaller States with some pro tection against the threat of random as saults.  Yours sincerely,  SIR PHlLIP GooDHART,  Member of Parliament.   H.R. 4295  HON. MARK D. SIIJANDER  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 9, 1983  ",1983
