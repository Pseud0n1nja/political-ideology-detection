4,House,112,0.57,9,2012-01-17,Mr. LANKFORD.," I will tell you, living in Oklahoma City, and if you come  through Oklahoma at all, you’ll drive  around and you’ll see our beautiful  land, and you’ll drink our beautiful  water and breath our beautiful air; but  you’ll also realize that there are thousands of miles of pipeline underneath  your feet, because, you see, Oklahoma  is  the center of pipeline movement  through a lot of the United States.  In fact, just north and east of my  house  in Oklahoma City  is a small  town called Cushing, Oklahoma. And if  you know anything about pipeline and  about oil, you know about Cushing,  Oklahoma, because there’s a large storage facility there for a lot of petroleum  products, and it is the hub for everything that moves as far as oil and all  pipelines running through the Midwest.  Cushing, Oklahoma, is part of that connection for the Keystone pipeline.  When you talk to people  in Oklahoma about pipelines, we’re very familiar with what they are, how they move  energy, and how important they are to  our economy.  Let me just touch base on a couple of  things, though.  While we’re talking about Keystone,  it’s interesting to me in several ways.  One is I’m 43 years old, and for my entire life, I’ve heard people say in politics we need to have a national energy  policy. We need to be dependent on energy from our soil or from our nearest  neighbors, Canada and Mexico. We need  to have a North American focus of energy, and I would have to say I completely agree. But we’ve never had a  time in our life when we are closer to  that than right now.  The rising alternative of fuel options,  whether it be solar and wind, and I  hope all of them come to be, we’re still  decades away from them being able to  be  fully  established and out  there.  We’re very dependent on oil, gas, and  coal.  b2000  But we’re  finding new reserves  in  North America of oil, gas, and coal  that are solving a lot of the energy  issues that we currently have right  now. Many people don’t know that in  the last quarter of 2011, 58 percent of  the oil consumed in the United States  was found domestically in the United  States—58 percent. You go back just 20  years ago, 60 percent of all oil was coming from overseas; now almost 60 percent of all oil is in the United States,  coming from the United States.  We are making progress. Hydraulic  fracking, horizontal drilling,  finding  new well sites, great new technology in  geology, all the ways that we’re finding  these new sources of energy, doing it  cleaner and doing  it  less expensive  than we’ve ever done it before. That’s a  good thing for us. We are now close to  providing our own energy sources.  The second-largest reserve of oil in  the world is now from this area where  the Keystone Pipeline originates  in  Canada, the second-largest oil reserve  in the world. This is a key time for us  now, getting better technology in the  United States to be able to use our own  energy to now partner up with Canada  and continue drawing even more energy from Canada from this huge reserve that is there. We need to continue to draw from them in that sense.  Now you would think this would be a  simple thing—focus on our own national security. Why wouldn’t we continue to focus on it and say we are this  close to being energy independent, and  we are not dependent on energy from  the Middle East. Why wouldn’t we continue to take the steps on that?  In addition to that, why wouldn’t we  continue to expand on our pipelines?  You see, this is not the first time for  Keystone to do a pipeline coming from  Canada to the United States—it was  just a very few years ago. In fact, that  Keystone that they did a few years ago  took 24 months to permit. From the  exact same area to the same area, 24  months for the total permitting process. That pipeline is functional and active and running right now.  They want to double up the capacity.  So you would think this would be a  slam dunk. Let’s just add a second line  there. They run through the permit  process to the same system, but instead of 24 months this time, we’re now  at 42 months of permitting and still  climbing.  Where  the  same pipeline  crossing  over the border, drawing oil from the  exact same area, took 24 months a few  years ago, now that pipeline takes 42  months and climbing. We’re not sure  how much longer it’s going to take. In  addition to that, Keystone is running  there, that’s one company.  There’s  also  another  company,  Enbridge, which draws oil from that  exact same area in Canada and takes it  through the United States. That pipeline  is  also  currently  running  and  hasn’t had any issues with permitting  and through the process of construction that it did years ago.  You see, this is not some new oil discovery that’s up there that we’ve never  tapped  into. The United States uses  that oil and has used that oil for a long  time. It is a reserve that is from a reliable neighbor next door  in Canada  that’s consistent, that we’re not having  to deal with  issues  in the Strait of  Hormuz and wondering about the flow  of oil coming from the Middle East.  We’re dealing with the United States,  now 58 percent of our oil usage coming  from our own home country, and we’re  dealing with reliable neighbors dealing  with our pipelines,  like Canada and  Mexico. It’s the right thing to do for  our national security. It’s the right  thing to do  for  jobs. We’re talking  about  immediately, private  jobs. No  government participation other than  the permitting being finished. Private  money begins to sink in the billions of  dollars to be able to run almost 1,700  miles of pipeline.  We’re talking pipefitters, which are  based often in Oklahoma, by the way,  union  jobs,  right-to-work areas and  other job areas. You’re dealing with  steel manufacturers for that pipe, pipe  manufactured, most of it done in Arkansas. People digging  the ditches,  running  the  tractors,  driving  the  trucks. All of the different areas that  are attached to that, thousands of jobs  that begin immediately across the entire central part of the United States  and many manufacturing areas.  We need to be able to open that up  and let those jobs run and let’s get  those going on that. And then the third  thing on this, not only national security and jobs, but just basic common  sense. That oil will be sold somewhere.  It’s not a matter that we can argue and  complain about it and say that Canada  is not going to use their own resources.  When the second-largest discovery of  oil  in the world  is underneath your  feet, they’re going to sell that oil.  So just shutting it down and saying  Americans aren’t going  to  take  it,  we’re going to let them sell it off, and  they’ll send it west over into Asia, and  that will make things a  lot better,  doesn’t make common sense, number  one.  Number two is we should provide as  much national security as we can for  this. That’s basic common sense with  reliable neighbors.  Number three in the common sense is  this basic simple thing: It’s new pipeline. Now we can argue about pipeline  safety, and there are areas we need to  work on pipeline safety, and we in this  Congress as Republicans and Democrats  together have passed pipeline  safety  initiatives, and we should do  that. This will be the newest pipeline  in the country. It will have the highest  standards for safety, it will have the  highest level of technology and of monitoring of any pipeline in the country.  It is the best possible way to do it.  The alternative is to be able to put it  on trucks and trains, which have a  higher incidence for accidents. This is  the safest way to be able to do this.  And as I mentioned before, it’s not as if  we’re not already drawing this oil already. This just increases our capacity  and increases our ability to not be dependent on Venezuela and OPEC countries for our oil.  There are pipelines  from Enbridge  and Keystone running from that exact  same area all the way down to the gulf  already. We need to continue to  increase our capacity so that we are providing for our own energy long term.  I would submit to this Congress, and  I would submit to the President and  ask for his prompt approval, even early  would be great, of approval of this to  be able to move forward and say let’s  get this off our back, let’s get the jobs  going, let’s continue to move forward  with our national security, providing  for our own energy, and let’s continue  to work through this process so that  we don’t have to deal with issues like  this again.  Far be it from us, in the days to  come, that manufacturers would say I  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:32 Jan 18, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17JA7.022 H17JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2012
5,,112,0.513,23,2012-01-17,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, since 1983,  the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag and Bundesrat have conducted an annual  exchange program  for staff members  from  both countries. The program gives professional staff  the opportunity  to observe and  learn about each other’s political  institutions  and interact on issues of mutual interest.  A staff delegation from the U.S. Congress  will be selected to visit Germany for ten days  from May 18–27 of this year. During this ten  day exchange, the delegation will attend meetings  with  Bundestag/Bundesrat Members,  Bundestag and Bundesrat party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, business, academic, and media agencies.  A comparable delegation of German staff  members will visit  the United States  for  ten  days April 14–22 of this year. They will attend  similar meetings here in Washington. The U.S.  delegation is expected to facilitate these meetings.  The  Congress-Bundestag/Bundesrat  Exchange is highly regarded in Germany and the  United States, and is one of several exchange  programs sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to  foster better understanding of the politics and  policies of both countries. This exchange  is  funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished Hill staff who can  contribute to the success of the exchange on  both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag reciprocates by  sending  senior  staff professionals to the United States.  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest  in events  in Europe. Applicants need  not be working in the field of foreign affairs, although such a background can be helpful. The  composite U.S. delegation should exhibit a  range of expertise in issues of mutual concern  to the United States and Germany such as,  but not limited to, trade, security, the environment, economic development, health  care,  and other social policy issues. This year’s delegation should be familiar with transatlantic relations within  the  context of  recent world  events.  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to  help plan and implement the program for the  Bundestag/Bundesrat  staff members when  they visit the United States. Participants are  expected to assist in planning topical meetings  in Washington, and are encouraged  to host  one or two staffers in their Member’s district in  April, or to arrange for such a visit to another  Member’s district.  Participants are selected by a committee  composed of personnel  from  the Bureau of  Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State and past participants of the exchange.  Members of  the House and Senate who  would like a member of their staff to apply for  participation in this year’s program should direct them to submit a resume and cover letter  in which  they state  their qualifications,  the  contributions they can make to a successful  program and some assurances of their ability  to participate during the time stated.  Applications may be sent  to  the Office of  Interparliamentary Affairs, HC–4, the Capitol,  by 5 p.m. on Friday, February 24, 2012.  f  RECOGNIZING  MR.

6,,112,-0.515,23,2012-01-17,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public  servant, Mr. William  Le’Ron  Jackson. Mr.  Jackson is a lifelong resident of Byram, Mississippi. He is the son of Mrs. Hollia Smith-  Thompson, Henry Thompson, Jr., and Mr. William Smith. He is a graduate of Jackson State  University with a Bachelor of Science degree  in Criminal Justice. Mr. Jackson is aspiring to  obtain a law degree with an emphasis on Disability and Common law.  Mr. Jackson has been involved in numerous  volunteer activities throughout the years. He is  a dynamic  role model who mentors people  with and without disabilities  throughout  the  state on the values of education and self-advocacy. Mr. Jackson has worked  for Living  Independence  for Everyone, LIFE, of Mississippi and a  children’s medical program  under  the Mississippi Department of Health.  He has also served as an AmeriCorps Volunteer. Mr. Jackson always  finds  time  to give  back  to his community by giving statewide  presentations and serving on various committees, such as the My Voice My Choice Board  of Directors, Healthy Opportunities for Transition Advisory Council, Teen Empowerment  Success Training Council, and  the National  Youth Leadership Network.  During 2010, Mr. Jackson expanded his volunteer service by beginning a three-year term  as a Member of the Board of Directors for Disability Rights Mississippi, a non-profit agency  that provides protection and advocacy services to people with disabilities statewide.  Mr. Jackson recently was selected in March  2011, to be a part of a committee, formed with  the assistance of  the Commissioner of  the  United States Administration on Development  Disabilities, ADD, and other national self-advocacy organizations, to focus on improving self-  advocacy throughout the state of Mississippi.  During April 2011, Mr. Jackson was awarded the Governor’s Initiative for Volunteer Excellence, GIVE, Award, which is presented by  the Mississippi Commission  for  Volunteer  Service in cooperation with the Office of the  Governor  to  recognize  individuals, organizations, or  communities  for  volunteer efforts  which have made a significant difference  to  the state or to local communities, establishing  high standards for volunteer involvement and  effectiveness, and multiplying  resources  for  communities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in recognizing Mr. Jackson for his dedication  to serving others and giving back to the community.  f  MEMORIES OF DAVID KATZ  HON. E.

7,,112,0.405,23,2012-01-17,Mr. RIGELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  enter a statement into the RECORDon behalf  of my constituent, Sam Katz. Mr. Katz asked  me  to enter  the  following  remarks  into  the  RECORD in remembrance of his father, David  Katz. Mr. Katz’s statement follows:  Today, we mourn the loss of a great man;  a man who to us was simply known and loved  as, ‘‘Daddy.’’  Daddy was first and foremost a loving, caring, and dedicated husband  for nearly 59  years to the wonderful lady we simply know  and love as,  ‘‘Mommy.’’ Daddy’s love and  support for Mommy is something every man  should learn from.  We could not have asked for a more loving  and dedicated father. Always a father, he  was also our mentor, teacher, and when necessary, a friend. We were deeply blessed with  a very peaceful and loving family life with  two wonderful parents. We always believed  our parents’ love for each other was strong.  However, throughout Daddy’s illnesses this  past year, it became beautifully and painfully clear that their marriage was sustained  by true and genuine love. There were times  in the hospital and in care facilities when  Mommy would go to extremes just to give  Daddy a kiss because it meant so much to  her, and for as long as we can remember,  Mommy was the glimmer in Daddy’s eyes.  This was not a marriage that lasted out of  convenience or for the sake of their four  children. This beautiful and long marriage  endured better, worse, richer, poorer, sickness and health, and was still parted only by  death.  We never heard a cross word spoken between Mommy and Daddy, and never even  heard them call each other by their first  names. Everyone should be so fortunate!  Growing up was a lot of fun. We went on  regular summer vacations. Daddy traveled  quite a bit and at times, would take one or  more of us with him on the road. We traveled  to family Bar and Bat Mitzvahs and spent as  much time as possible together as a family.  Family dinners were very  important to  Daddy. We would wait for him to come home  from work and the entire family would have  dinner together and talk about our day. We  spent evenings together watching our 19″  black and white TV in the family room—the  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

The Androscoggin Chamber  has an outstanding record of creating and providing opportunities  that promote economic  and community growth in the communities that  make up the heart of Central Maine.  Every  year,  the  Androscoggin  County  Chamber of Commerce honors some of  the  outstanding  individuals  that work hard each  and every day to make the Lewiston/Auburn  region a better place to do business. Their efforts to strengthen opportunity and prosperity  in Maine are remarkable, and the whole community benefits from the example of their success.  This year’s award recipients include Agren  Appliance  and  Baxter  Brewing,  Business  Leadership  Awards;  Steve  Closson  of  Androscoggin Bank,  the Ray Geiger Award;  L/A Cash Coalition and L/A Art Walk, Community Service Awards; Pike Industries, the Poland Business Award; Auburn Chief of Police  and Acting City Manager Phil Crowell,  the  Public Service  Leadership Award; Healthy  Androscoggin, the Education Award; Industrial  Roofing, the Cool Chamber Award; Lewiston  Career Center,  the Ken Addition Award  for  Business Advocacy; Center Street Dental,  New Member of the Year; and, Northeastern  Charter and Tours, and  the Library Cafe´,  President’s Awards.  These businesses, individuals, and organizations are among  the very best  that  the  Androscoggin County  region  has  to  offer.  Thanks  to  the  contributions of  this  year’s  award winners, Androscoggin County  is a  great place to work and live. I wish them all  continued success going forward.

9,,112,0.433,30,2012-01-17,Mr. GUINTA.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I congratulate Philip Provencher  of Dunbarton, New Hampshire, on receiving  the French Legion of Honor. It is truly a prestigious distinction to be appointed a Chevalier  of the French Legion of Honor by the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Throughout  history, France has been a strong ally to the  United States and it is greatly appreciated that  they continue to recognize the heroic acts of  the brave men and women of our Armed  Forces, and for the sacrifices and service performed  to assist  the French people during  World War II.  As a member of the U.S. Army’s First Infantry Division, Philip joined with allied forces on  D-Day to help liberate France from the Germans by carrying a 50 lb. mortar on his back  through  the  turbulent  tides of  the English  Channel,  to help support ground  forces on  Omaha Beach. As a  translator  for his unit,  ‘‘Frenchy’’  then marched with his  fellow soldiers through France, Belgium, and Germany.  His valiant efforts during  this campaign also  earned him a Bronze Star  for  rescuing a  wounded friend while under enemy fire.  These are but a few examples of the heroic  and  courageous acts Mr. Provencher performed in service to his country during WWII  and  I  join with President Sarkozy and Governor Lynch in congratulating Philip on this esteemed  recognition. On behalf of a grateful  nation, I thank him for his dedicated service to  our country.  IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT  OF  SANDY  HOPP  FROM  THE  COUNTY OF STANISLAUS  HON. DENNIS A.

10,,112,-0.262,30,2012-01-17,Mr. CARDOZA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Mrs. Sandy Hopp  in  the event of  her retirement from Stanislaus County.  Sandy Hopp has been an employee of the  County of Stanislaus since January 2003. She  was recruited to work as a Field Representative for Supervisor Jeff Grover, a position she  held for eight years. She is currently the Field  Representative  to Supervisor Terry Withrow,  representing Supervisorial District Three. After  being hired, she quickly increased in responsibilities and exhibited a great skill in working  with people in all walks of life. She is often the  eyes, ears and voice of her elected Supervisor, and represents the Supervisor in venues  such as the Salida Municipal Advisory Committee, the Weed and Seed Project and other  community meetings and organizations.  Mrs. Hopp has a tremendous understanding  of government operations and serves as an  outstanding interface between the Supervisors’  Office, County departments,  the community  and various state and federal organizations. In  her role, Mrs. Hopp quickly developed a passion  for  the area of  legislative and governmental affairs. She was selected as a liaison  to  a French  delegation  visiting Stanislaus  County, she serves as the coordinator of Government Day for the elite Leadership Modesto  program and she was a coordinator of the San  Joaquin Valley Regional Association of California Counties Supervisors Association Annual Meeting.  Mrs. Hopp is an outstanding liaison with the  offices of local, state and federal elected officials. A personal highlight of mine  is when  Stanislaus County officials visit Washington,  D.C.  to present projects and priorities. Mrs.  Hopp coordinates extremely complex schedules  for maximum efficiency of  the  trip and  also serves as an outstanding liaison to Congressional offices. Visiting with Mrs. Hopp on  these trips is always a highlight for my staff  and for me personally.  Mrs. Hopp has a personal commitment  to  excellence and a strong faith which is central  to whom she is as a person and to her service  to her family, church and community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me in honoring Mrs. Sandy Hopp for her many  years  of  dedication  to  the  County  of  Stanislaus.  f  RECOGNIZING  ELDER  HENRY  SMILEY  FOR  HIS  DEDICATION  AND SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY  HON.

11,House,112,0.641,3,2012-01-23,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, unemployment is still at an all-time high; and  the high cost of energy is having a significant negative  impact on my district’s economy as well as on the economy of the entire country.  But when President Obama had the  opportunity to help job creation and  lower energy costs, he turned his back  on hardworking American taxpayers.  And as my colleague from Mississippi  has just spelled out, we have just seen  the highest energy costs ever in this  country last year, and the cost of gasoline itself has more than doubled under  this President.  President Obama has done all he can  to stand in the way of businesses that  can help get Americans back to work.  The Keystone XL pipeline is a $7 billion  private  sector  infrastructure  project that will create 20,000 jobs with  its  construction  and  an  estimated  100,000 indirect jobs during the life of  its operation.  For the 3 years that President Obama  has been in office, he’s delayed this  project for political benefit in order to  placate his liberal base. Liberals who  oppose this project say that these jobs  are ‘‘temporary’’ and somehow of less  value. This is not just misguided, but  insulting. All  construction  jobs, by  their essence, are temporary. No construction project is permanent. It’s a  dangerous precedent these groups are  setting  by  denigrating  hardworking  Americans for the type of work they  perform.  The President  is  in  full campaign  mode. He’s more  interested  in protecting his job than allowing the private sector to create jobs.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to  import energy  from Middle Eastern  countries. North American energy will  lead to energy security, lower energy  costs, and more jobs for Americans.  RECESS  ",2012
12,House,112,0.428,3,2012-01-23,Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  here is the simple truth: the Obama administration is driven by a far left liberal  ideology rather than the  facts.  This administration says it wants to  put America back to work, but through  its policies is doing the exact opposite.  For example, because of the EPA’s new  train wreck of regulation, up to 160 direct jobs will be lost with the accelerated  closure  of  Beverly,  Ohio’s  Muskingum coal-fired power plant.

17,House,112,0.473,10,2012-01-23,Mr. FLEISCHMANN.," Mr. Speaker, I  was honored to speak at the March for  Life today at the rally on the National  Mall earlier today. Thousands of Americans came together in our cause to  protect the sanctity of all human life  and voice our continued opposition to  the decision made in Roe v. Wade.  I am reminded each and every day  now how precious life is and why we  should stand up for its intrinsic value.  It is our belief that life is sacred from  the moment of conception until the  grave.  That separates us from so many others in the world. Every abortion is a  tragedy, but being pro-life isn’t just  about conception to birth, it’s about  the entire existence of a person. It encompasses more than just their physical well-being. A soul cannot flourish,  a person cannot prosper if they aren’t  first allowed to live. Being pro-life is  also promoting faith, education, jobs  and the overall quality of life.  I will continue to fight against the  culture of abortion and fight for the  right of life, liberty and the pursuit of  happiness.  f  CENTER AISLE CAUCUS  (Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)

18,House,112,-0.312,10,2012-01-23,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I’m so grateful that as we prepare to receive the President tomorrow  night for his State of the Union Address that we’re going to be joined by  our colleague, Congresswoman GABBY  GIFFORDS. The courage that she has  shone in her long recovery has been an  inspiration to all of us, and I’m proud  to call her a friend.  Last year, in the aftermath of that  terrible and tragic shooting, we came  together as a Congress for the State of  the Union. We put aside our partisan  differences,  and we  convened  as  a  united  body. Republicans  sat with  Democrats, conservative Members sat  with liberal Members. It was a small  but symbolic gesture that this place  can  rise  above  partnership  for  the  greater good of this Nation.  As cochair of  the House’s Center  Aisle Caucus, I, along with my fellow  cochairs are calling on this House to do  it again. Tomorrow night, let’s sit together,  let’s show the Nation again  that with GABBY in our midst we can  be one rather than be divided. Now our  small but growing caucus brings together Members who believe that we  can discuss issues in a civil and respectful manner. I hope that all of you,  all of my colleagues, will join us in an  effort to build on the success of last  year and start a new bipartisanship  tradition in this House.  HONORING FORMER ILLINOIS REPRESENTATIVE  EDWARD  DERWINSKI  (Mrs. BIGGERT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2012
19,House,112,0.323,10,2012-01-23,Mrs. BIGGERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today with great sadness to report the  passing of former Illinois Representative Edward Derwinski.  Congressman Derwinski dedicated his  life to public service, including 24 years  here  in  the House  serving  Illinois’  Fourth District from 1959 to 1983. He  passed away on January 15 at the age  of 85. Perhaps best known for his colorful and engaging personality, he went  on to serve as the Undersecretary of  State  for National Security Affairs,  and in 1989 he led efforts to renew our  country’s commitment to its veterans  as first ever Secretary for Veterans Affairs.  President George H.W. Bush once  said of Ed, a former infantryman in  World War II, that he had the skill of  a seasoned legislator, the patience of a  practiced administrator, the finesse of  a diplomat, and the heart of a man who  knows what it means to start his government career as a private  in the  United States Army.  Today I join my colleagues in the Illinois delegation in honoring his service  to  our State  and Nation. My  thoughts and prayers are with all those  who knew him best, especially his wife,  Bonnie;  son,  Michael;  daughter,  Maureen; stepdaughter, Maggie; stepson, Kevin; sister, Bernadette; and his  seven grandchildren.  f  TRIBUTE TO ARMY MASTER  SERGEANT JOHN F.

20,House,112,0.547,10,2012-01-23,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker,  last Friday  retired Army  Master Sergeant John F. Baker, Jr., a  recipient of the Medal of Honor, died at  the age of 66.  Master Sergeant Baker was a native  of Davenport, Iowa, before relocating  to South Carolina. My thoughts and  prayers are with his wife, Donnell, and  the Baker  family. Master Sergeant  Baker served in Vietnam and received  the Medal of Honor after braving intense Communist fire to safe the lives  of eight American soldiers on November 5, 1966.  Master Sergeant Baker was one of 239  servicemembers to receive our Nation’s  highest  honor  for  conspicuous  gallantry and courage during their service  in the Vietnam War. He was also the  last Army soldier to be awarded the  Medal of Honor and have residency in  South Carolina.  Our country is very grateful for the  service of Master Sergeant John Baker.

21,House,112,-0.458,17,2012-01-23,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," First, I  want to speak to the gentlelady’s last  comment and say that you have been a  champion for the Virgin Islands. I have  had  the privilege of having  several  meetings there. They are generous people, they are our neighbors, and so I  personally want to say, experiencing  and understanding the impact of the  loss of a major entity  is something  many of us have gone through.  In this instance I wanted to say, yes,  we will stand with you and be of help.  I’m introducing legislation that deals  with trying to look at the energy industry in a way to help it grow in a fair  way, to be environmentally safe, and I  know that you are certainly someone  who is a champion of the environment  but have found that that business is  served economically, and  I want  to  make sure that we have these kinds of  industries, and they are not mutually  exclusive.  I don’t have the  facts of  what has generated this action, but we  need to be helpful.  My legislation talks about using the  energy  industry to also support  improving the environment, and I think  that creates jobs as well. So I just want  to say that I look forward to working  with you and thank you for bringing  that  issue to our attention, because  voter protection gives people the opportunity  for expressing their views.  We know that the opportunity for work  and for jobs is crucial as well.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  need  to protect democracy,  to protect  the  voice of the American people, and to ensure  the right to vote continues to be treated as a  right under the Constitution rather than being  treated as though it is privilege.  I am joined by my colleagues here today to  call on all Americans to reject and denounce  tactics and measures that have absolutely no  place  in our democracy.  I call on African-  Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, as  well as Asian-American voters  to band  together  to  fight  for  their right  to vote and  to  work together to understand their voting rights  which are granted to citizens of our nation by  our laws and our Constitution.  I call on these citizens to stand against harassment and intimidation, to vote in the face  of such adversity. The most effective way to  curb tactics of intimidation and harassment is  to vote. Is to stand together to fight against  any measures that would have the effect of  preventing every eligible citizen  from being  able to vote. Voting ensures active participation in democracy.  As a Member of this body, I firmly believe  that we must protect the rights of all eligible  citizens to vote. Over the past few decades,  minorities  in  this country have witnessed a  pattern of efforts to intimidate and harass minority voters through so-called ‘‘Voter ID’’ requirements.  I am sad  to  report  that as we  head into the 21st century, these efforts continue.  Never in the history of our nation, has the  effect of one person, one vote, been more important. A great Spanish Philosopher, George  Santayana once  said  ‘‘Those who  cannot  learn from history are doomed to repeat it.’’  Our history has  taught us  that denying  the  right to vote based on race, gender or class is  a stain on the democratic principles that we all  value. The Voting Rights Act was a reaction to  the actions of our passed and a way to pave  the road to a new future.  The Voting Rights Act (VRA) was adopted  in 1965 and was extended  in 1970, 1975,  1982, and 2007. This legislation is considered  the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted by the United States Congress. Contrary  to  the prevailing rumor  that  the Act is due to expire, leaving minorities with  no rights, the Act is actually due for reauthorization in the 2nd session of the 108th Congress-there is no doubt about whether it will  continue to protect our rights in the future.  The VRA codifies and effectuates the 15th  Amendment’s  permanent  guarantee  that,  throughout the nation, no person shall be denied the right to vote on account of race or  color. Adopted at a time when African Americans were substantially disfranchised in many  Southern states, the Act employed measures  to restore the right to vote to citizens of all  U.S. states.  By 1965, proponents of disenfranchisement  made violent attempts to thwart the efforts of  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:22 Jan 24, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K23JA7.036 H23JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2012

I would like to now yield to the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. STEVAN  PEARCE, who  is back  to us having  served  in the House. He came back  after a different run.  He is a stalwart for life and a great  friend of the unborn.  b2100  ",2012
23,House,112,0.471,24,2012-01-23,Mr. PEARCE.," Thanks to the gentleman  from New Jersey  for  leading  this issue. The value of a Nation is  measured in its willingness to speak  for the most fragile among us.  In the United States, it is punishable  by 5 years in jail and a $250,000 fine to  destroy an eagle egg, an embryo. If you  destroy a human embryo, it is not only  fully  legal, but  it  is  federally sanctioned. The Nation needs to pause and  ask itself about these convoluted values.  It does not pass without note that  Roe vs. Wade, 39 years ago, was passed  in 1973. It was the same year that the  Endangered Species Act was passed  protecting the eagle eggs. So at the  point that this Nation was fully sanctioning the destruction of human embryos, it was fully protecting embryos  of other species.  I’m fully confident today that this  tragedy is going to be reversed because  I hear young men and young women  across this Nation who are looking at  the scientific evidence to understand  that it is more than a blob of tissue,  but this is human life that we’re ending.  We see the decline in the value of the  human in our culture because of decisions that this Nation’s policy leaders  have made, and  I see young people  across this land beginning to stand up  and let their voices be heard. And when  we speak with one voice, Washington  listens. And in this case of protecting  the human life, it is time for Washington to listen.  ",2012
24,House,112,0.496,24,2012-01-23,Mrs. HARTZLER.," Thank  you  so  much, Congressman. It is an honor to  be here tonight on the anniversary of  the 39th year of the Roe v. Wade court  decision. And today it was so encouraging to see the hundreds of thousands  of people from all across this country  come here to march and to commemorate this deadline, this decision, and to  celebrate life and to pray for the day  when all life is valued in this country.  It was cold, about 36 degrees here,  and it was rainy, but people stood for  hours out in the rain, not minding, because they believe in life. And people  may  say, well, why are  the people  doing this? And why are you pro-life?  And I’d just like to summarize it, Mr.  Speaker, in that, basically because it’s  a child, not a choice. We see those  bumper stickers around and we don’t  think  about  them  very much. But  those words and that reality certainly  has meaning  for me because words  matter.  I was in sixth grade when the Roe vs.  Wade decision came down, and I remember hearing a little bit about it,  but not thinking too much about it. I  was just busy being a 12-year old kid.  But I remember one day in the hallway  at school when a girl stopped me and  said something about well, what do you  think about abortion? What do you  think? And I said, well, I don’t know.  And she said, well, do you think a  woman should have a right to do with  her body whatever she wants, and the  government shouldn’t tell her what to  do? And I said, well, yeah. And she said  well, you’re pro-choice. And I said oh,  well, okay. And I didn’t feel quite right  about it, but I didn’t have much information, I didn’t have much  facts, I  didn’t know. So I remember in the future somebody asked me whether I was  pro-choice, and I said yeah.  But then something happened. I got  some facts, I got some information. It  was in high school, in a child development class. And all of a sudden I got to  see, for the first time, pictures of a developing baby. And let me show one to  you now. This is one of the pictures  that I saw, and this is of a 2-month old  baby.  And I looked at all of these pictures,  and I heard the information, and I realized that abortion is taking this life,  and it’s alive. It is a child. It is not a  choice.  Here’s  some  facts  that  I  learned:  That at day  22,  that’s  just over  3  weeks, when most girls don’t  even  know they’re pregnant yet, the heart  begins to beat. By the end of the third  week the child’s backbone, spinal column, and nervous system are forming.  By week six, brain waves are detectable,  fingernails are  forming. Week  seven, eyelids and toes form. The nose  is distinct and the baby is kicking and  swimming.  By the end of the second month,  which  is how old this baby  is here,  every organ is in place. Bones begin to  replace cartilage. Fingerprints begin to  form, and the baby begins to hear.  By week 9 and 10, the baby can turn  his head and frown, and the baby can  hiccup. By weeks 10 and 11, the baby  can breathe amniotic fluid and it can  grasp  objects  in  its hand. Perhaps  you’ve seen that famous picture of that  surgery on that unborn baby and how  that hand came out and grasped the  doctor’s finger.  Week 12, end of the third month, the  baby has all the parts necessary to experience  pain.  Like my  colleague  talked about, its vocal cords are complete, and the baby can suck its thumb.  Some facts that I also learned are,  for instance, in 2008 there were 1.21 million abortions done and of those, 92  percent of those abortions were done  during the first 3 months of life. So  what that means is that there are abortions, and  it would average out  to  about 138 an hour, I figured up, two for  the minute  that  I’m  talking here,  where abortions are taking place on babies that can hear, that have a beating  heart, that have brain waves going, and  that have vocal cords.  It is about a child. This is not about  a choice. And I commend all the people  who came here today to Washington to  speak out on behalf of life. And with  them, I celebrate, and look forward to  the day when all Americans are granted the right to life, whether they’re  born or unborn.  So thank you, Mr. Speaker, for having us today.  ",2012

This is the  kind of introduction my father would  have enjoyed but my mother would  have believed.  I appreciate  so very  much his kind comments.  The Nebraska Supreme Court temporarily stayed the execution of one prisoner, a Carey Dean Moore, because a  full evidentiary record was before it in  another  immediately  pending  case,  State v. Mata, which was referred to by  my friend and colleague from Alabama,  Senator  SESSIONS. That  case  challenged the constitutionality of electrocution as a method of execution. It did  not challenge, it did not deal with, and  was not associated with whether or not  to have a death penalty. It was not  challenging the death penalty but the  methodology of a death penalty.  The court had to determine whether  a prisoner should be executed depending on whether that question was soon  answered. The  temporary  stay was  issued and the other case decided as a  matter of State  constitutional  law.  The court, by a vote of 6 to 1, determined that execution as a method—and  I emphasize ‘‘a method’’ of electrocution—violated  prohibitions  against  cruel and unusual punishment, which  is the purview of the court to make  that determination where there  is a  question of dealing with the Constitution.  The court was clear that the death  penalty remained valid  in Nebraska.  No writ of certiorari had been taken.  The Nebraska Legislature changed the  method of execution to lethal injection, and the execution of Moore, Mata,  and others will be carried out accordingly.  As a matter of fact, the court has set  a date of execution for a prisoner to be  executed on March 6. This same court  set dates of execution while I was Governor on  three occasions, and  they  were carried out.

28,Senate,112,0.495,59,2012-01-23,Mr. VITTER.," Mr. President today, I  would like to recognize and honor the  valuable  contributions  of  Catholic  schools in educating our young people  throughout our great Nation. This year  from January 29 to February 5, we will  celebrate Catholic Schools Week  to  recognize  the  exceptional work  of  Catholic education programs across the  country.  Our Nation’s Catholic schools have  received international praise for academic excellence and have provided  students with lessons that extend far  beyond the classroom. These schools  have continued to impart comprehensive curriculums that emphasize moral,  intellectual, and physical development  in young people.  In Louisiana, our Catholic schools  maintain high academic standards, foster a healthy learning environment for  students,  and  encourage  family  involvement in the ongoing education of  children.  Today, more than two million students attend Catholic schools in the  United States, and Catholic schools nationally graduate 99 percent of students with more than 97 percent pursuing college degrees.  The National Conference of Catholic  Bishops stated,  ‘‘Education is one of  the most important ways by which the  Church fulfills its commitment to the  dignity of the person and building of  community. Community is central to  education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of  the Church, therefore, must be directed  to forming persons-in-community; for  the education of the individual Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of  the many communities  in which he  lives.’’  This statement not only stresses the  importance of education as part of the  mission of the Catholic Church, but  also the importance of community and  schools in shaping our young people as  they go out in to the world to become  valuable members of society and their  community.  This week, we recognize the students,  their  families,  teachers, administrators, all of our parish leaders, and our  communities for their efforts to support our Catholic schools and continued achievement towards the education  of our young people.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

30,,112,-0.233,73,2012-01-23,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Fire Chief Anthony Bednarz upon his  retirement after 50 years of service to the residents of Western Springs and Riverside, Illinois, two villages in my district. He retired on  December 31, 2011. These two villages are,  and always will be, safer thanks to his efforts.  The seeds of Chief Bednarz’s career were  planted at a  young age,  since his  father  served as a firefighter as well. Thinking that  he wanted to avoid firefighting, Chief Bednarz  entered  the United States Army where he  served  honorably. After  his  discharge,  he  changed his mind and  joined  the Riverside  Fire Department in 1961. He knew almost immediately that he wanted to be a leader within  the department and took classes to be one of  the first to earn a degree in Fire Science from  the College of DuPage.  Over the years, Chief Bednarz gained the  respect of his peers and eventually became  Fire Chief of the Riverside Fire Department in  1976—a position he would hold for the next  30 years. The Riverside Fire Department  is  one of the most progressive and effective in  the area  thanks  to  the  leadership of Chief  Bednarz. He was pivotal  in modernizing  the  department’s building and  rolling stock. He  also  coordinated  the Riverside  emergency  medical response system in the 1970s.  Chief Bednarz left the Riverside Fire Department  five  years ago  to  join  the Western  Springs Fire Department where he helped  make improvements and guided the construction of a new building for the fire department.  Chief Bednarz has touched countless lives  as a firefighter, manager, and mentor. He will  be missed as a veteran firefighter and we are  all sad to see him go. But it is a happy time  for his family, as his retirement will give him  more time to enjoy with his wife, Marianne, his  children, Krista, Lisa, Charles, and Paula, and  his grandchildren. I thank Fire Chief Anthony  Bednarz for his career of service and I wish  him a long and happy retirement.  f  HONORING RACHEL COLLETT  HON. THADDEUS G.

On December 3, 2011, the Mustangs defeated  the Tomball Concordia Lutheran Crusaders to  win  the TAPPS Division  II State Championship.  The Mustangs finish the season with a 12–  2 record, winning 12 consecutive games to finish the season and capture the state championship.  I want  to congratulate  the  team on  their  dedication and hard work. This  remarkable  season was capped by a thrilling state championship  that was  a  fight  to  the  finish.  Throughout the ups and downs of this year,  the Mustangs persevered and clung together  as a unit, ultimately winning state. I applaud  their dedication and hard work.  Coach Greg McClendon, as well as  the  young men on the team, deserves recognition  for the accomplishment. This victory marks the  fifth 11-man state championship for the Mustangs—an outstanding accomplishment. I encourage them to enjoy this achievement to the  utmost.  It  is my honor  to  represent  the Midland  Christian School Mustangs and  their state  championship football team. Again, I congratulate the Mustangs on an outstanding season.  f  IN HONOR OF CONNIE COKER  HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 23, 2012  ",2012
33,,112,-0.408,80,2012-01-23,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, in a loss we are  only  just beginning  to  feel, Connie Coker  stepped down as Rockland County Legislator  at  the end of 2011. To me she  typified  the  Rockland spirit of enthusiasm, common sense,  hard work, and  intelligence. She cared  for  people and worked hard to help them in any  way a legislator could. To top it off, she is a  genuinely nice person and I’m happy to call  her a good friend.  Connie came  to  the  legislature  in April,  2006, winning a special election and then winning her re-election in 2007. She was tireless  in advocating for clean air and water, affordable housing, green space, clean energy, a  fair  tax structure, and against overdevelopment and the dangers associated with Indian  Point.  In  the County Legislature she served as  Chair of the Environmental Committee, Vice-  Chair of the Multi-Services Committee and the  Special County Comprehensive Plan Committee, was a member of  the Public Safety  Committee and  the Solid Waste Authority  Board, and served as the Legislative Liaison  to the Fire Advisory Board, to the Volunteer  Counseling Service, and to the Environmental  Management Committee.  She is a Registered Nurse and a Licensed  Midwife and her legislative agenda was based  on her commitment to the health, well-being  and safety of the citizens of Rockland County.  Connie lives in South Nyack with her husband Erik Larsen, a doctor. They have  two  daughters: Keah Larsen, a graduate of Nyack  High School and SUNY New Paltz with a degree in Women’s Studies; and Anika Larsen,  also a graduate of Nyack High School who attended SUNY Delhi-Culinary Arts and Rockland Community College.  I will miss seeing Connie at the events we  both went  to.  I will miss  far more  the wise  counsel she had to offer and her sound advice  about  the areas we both  represented. By  happy coincidence we both  represented a  17th District. She is a good and gracious person who represented her constituents wisely  and well. We are all better for knowing her.  f  RECOGNIZING JAMES BURKE  HON. TIMOTHY H. BISHOP  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 23, 2012  ",2012
34,,112,-0.338,80,2012-01-23,Mr. BISHOP of New York.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to recognize and honor the newly  invested chief of the Suffolk County Police Department, James C. Burke. A dedicated  law  enforcement officer, Chief Burke has devoted  his career to the service and protection of his  community.  Chief Burke began his service at the New  York City Police Department  in January of  1985, before moving to the Suffolk County PD  in July of the following year. During his time  with  the department, Burke has served  in a  variety of  leadership  roles,  including supervising the patrol and detective divisions.  In addition  to commanding  the Organized  Crime Bureau of the SCPD, Chief Burke has,  since 2006, served as the chief investigator for  the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.  Burke also has demonstrated a commitment to  law enforcement education and  is  frequently  called to give lectures to groups around the  country.  On January 1, 2012, James Burke was promoted to Chief of the Suffolk County Police  Department,  the pinnacle, but by no means  the end, of a long and distinguished career.  Chief Burke will continue to serve his community as the highest ranking uniformed officer in  the county, upholding  the high standard  for  which the SCPD has become known.  Mr. Speaker, I honor James Burke for his  invaluable and continuing contributions to our  community. It is my great hope that his tenure  with the department will be a credit to him and  the officers he now oversees. I look forward to  working with Chief Burke and supporting the  department in its mission to keep Long Island  safe and secure.  f  POVERTY IN CUBA  HON.

35,,112,-0.401,80,2012-01-23,Mr. SIRES.," Mr. Speaker, I submit the following  regarding  the  culture of poverty  in  Cuba under the Castro regime.  [From the Jersey Journal, Dec. 31, 2011]  CUBA’SCULTUREOFPOVERTYPERSISTS  (By Roland A. Alum)  The Fidel-&-Raul Castro regime marks 53  years this Jan. 1. The brothers unquestionably  enjoyed  extraordinary popularity  in  1959, but the enthusiasm soon vanished as  they turned Cuba into a financially and spiritually bankrupt Marxist anti-utopia.  As a result, nearly two million Cubans of  all social backgrounds have fled, many of  them settling in Hudson County.  By the 1950s, Cuba was a regional leader in  numerous social indicators, notwithstanding  instability and corruption during the republican era (1902–1958). But since 1959 the island-nation has become a backward, closed  society beleaguered by unproductivity and  rationing.  Sociologist Tomas Masaryk noted  that  ‘‘dictators  ‘look good’ until the last minutes’’; in Cuba’s case, it seems particularly  fine  to  certain U.S.  intellectuals. Comfortably  from abroad, apologists  contend  that most of the socioeconomic problems  that traditionally afflicted the prior five and  a half decades were eliminated after 1959.  Yet, fact-finding by international social-scientists challenges this fantasy.  An early, little-known account uncovering  some effects of the Castros’ regimentation  came from research in Cuba in 1969–’70 by  U.S.  cultural-anthropologists Oscar Lewis  and Douglas Butterworth. They intended to  test Lewis’ theory that a culture of poverty  would not exist in a Marxist-oriented society. They had naively presupposed that the  socially alienating conditions that engender  such phenomena could develop among the  poor solely under capitalism.  The  Lewis-Butterworth  early  on-the-  ground scrutiny validates many accounts by  respected experts and the much vilified exiles. There exists a culture of poverty in  Cuba, although it is not necessarily a survivor of the old times, but seemingly a by-  product of the Castros’ totalitarian socialism. There were always poor Cubans, and  some version of the culture of poverty might  have existed before; but in my communications with Butterworth, he reconfirmed another discovery. The researchers could not  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:01 Jan 24, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A23JA8.020 E23JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2012
36,House,112,0.202,3,2012-02-01,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to honor the Girl Scouts of  the USA, which will be celebrating its  100th anniversary on March 12, 2012.  For 100 years, the Girl Scouts have  fostered an environment that has created generations of women with sound  character and strong leadership skills.  Founded by Juliette Gordon Low in Savannah, Georgia, the first troop consisted of just 18 Girl Scouts. Today,  there are more than 3.7 million Girl  Scouts and more  than  100  councils  across our Nation. Since its start, more  than 50 million women have been a  part of  this extraordinary organization.  The Girl Scouts of America teaches  young women the importance of leadership and of community service. This  past Sunday, I proudly participated in  Troop 21292’s Girl Scout Gold Award  ceremony  in honoring  seven young  women from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It pleases me to recognize these  Girl Scouts for their exceptional accomplishment:  Christine  DiPierro,  Catherine Silvernail, Charlotte Triebl,  Emily Kraeck, Emily Nowalinski, Kimberly Wodzanowski,  and Margaret  Zelin. These young  ladies exemplify  courage, confidence, and character, and  have made the world a better place,  which has been the mission of the Girl  Scouts of the USA for 100 years.  Mr. Speaker, on March 16, 1950, the  United States Congress chartered the  Girl Scouts of the USA. Today, as the  Member of the United States Congress  representing  Pennsylvania’s  Eighth  District, it is my privilege to congratulate the Girl Scouts of the USA as they  commemorate  100 years of building  girls of courage, confidence, and character who have truly made the world a  better place. Best wishes for success in  the next 100 years.  f  CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK  ",2012
37,House,112,-0.233,3,2012-02-01,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, as a  proud  graduate  of St. Symphorosa  Grammar School and St. Ignatius College Prep, and as a strong supporter of  Catholic education, I have again this  year introduced a resolution in honor  of Catholic Schools Week to highlight  the  contributions  Catholic  schools  make, not only to the students who attend them, but to our entire Nation.  Since  1974,  the National Catholic  Educational  Association  and  the  United States Conference of Catholic  Bishops have provided  leadership  in  planning  and  organizing  Catholic  Schools Week. This year,  it  is celebrated from January 29 through February  5. The  theme,  ‘‘Faith, Academics, Service,’’ celebrates the broad  educational experience Catholic school  students receive. Catholic school students are not only focused on academic  excellence but also on enriching the  spiritual character and moral development of young Americans.  America’s Catholic schools produce  graduates with the skills and integrity  needed by our businesses, governments,  and communities, emphasizing a well-  rounded education and  instilling the  values of giving back to the community and helping others. Nearly every  Catholic school has a community service program, and their students volunteer half-a-million hours every year to  their parishes and communities. My  own decision to pursue a career  in  teaching and then in public service was  fostered in part by the dedicated teachers throughout my years in Catholic  schools.  Today, over 2 million elementary and  secondary  students  are  enrolled  in  nearly  7,000 Catholic  schools, where  these students typically excel. They  surpass their peers in math, science,  reading,  history,  and  geography  in  NAEP tests. The graduation rate for  Catholic high school students is 99 percent, and 85 percent of the graduates of  these schools attend a 4-year college.  As we continue to hear disturbing reports about our national test scores,  these statistics are truly remarkable  and should be commended.  Notably,  the  success  of  Catholic  schools does not depend on selectivity.  These academic achievements are realized by students from all walks of life.  Catholic schools accept 9 out of every  10 students who apply, and are highly  effective in providing a quality education to students from every socioeconomic group, especially disadvantaged youths  in underserved urban  communities. Over the past 30 years,  the percentage of minority students  enrolled in Catholic schools has more  than doubled, and  today  they  constitute almost one-third of all Catholic  school students. In times of economic  hardship, Catholic schools provide an  affordable alternative to other forms of  private education.  In addition to producing well-rounded students, Catholic schools save taxpayers billions of dollars each year by  lowering the number of students in already overburdened public schools. It is  estimated that taxpayers save over $1  billion from students attending Catholic schools in the Chicago area alone  and approximately $20 billion nationwide. The importance of these savings  is undeniable as we in Congress and as  lawmakers across the country struggle  with deficits.

39,House,112,-0.302,87,2012-02-01,Mr. MORAN.," Madam  Speaker,  I  thank my very good friend, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, for yielding me this time to  rise in strong opposition to an extension of the current pay freeze for Federal employees.  This legislation is a cynical attempt  to tap into misguided resentment fostered by the far right against the Federal Government and the 2 million men  and women who serve our Nation as  civil servants.  Of those 2 million, let me point out  to my colleagues that nearly two out  of three civil servants work for the Department of Defense, the Department  of Homeland Security, the Department  of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Justice. In other words, two  out of three Federal employees work in  jobs related to our national security at  home and abroad or caring for our veterans. Every one of those employees  now seems to be the target of this  body’s misguided anger, and that’s just  wrong.  Most of our Federal employees work  for the Defense Department to enhance  our security. Employees at the Department of Homeland Security work to  ensure that nuclear materials aren’t  smuggled  into our country by those  who want to do us catastrophic harm.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation  works  to  investigate  and  prosecute  cybercriminals that steal billions of  dollars of  intellectual property  from  our defense and civilian industrial base  every year. This body claims to care  about preventing nuclear terrorism and  halting cyber crime, yet we want to  punish those charged with carrying out  that mission.  Last year, a constituent of mine was  awarded a ‘‘Sammie’’ from the Partnership for Public Service for his work  at the VA helping to address veterans  struggling with the human toll of warfare. My constituent has devoted 30  years of his career building a national  network  of  small,  community-based  centers where veterans traumatized by  combat obtain counseling, job assistance, medical referrals, and other services. The Partnership  rewarded him  last year, but today the House wants to  forfeit his pay raise for a third consecutive year.  This bill is the product of an ideologically extreme group of people who  got elected by insisting that our government  is  broken. And  now  that  they’re elected, they want to try to  prove that is the case. It’s not the case.  We ought to be proud of our government and reject this bill.  ",2012
40,House,112,-0.306,87,2012-02-01,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, once again the Republican leadership is attacking America’s 2.3 million civilian Federal  employees. In a brazen act of political opportunism, Speaker BOEHNER is using the public’s  well-founded dissatisfaction with Congress to  bludgeon public servants. H.R. 3835, which  we will vote on under suspension of the rules  on Wednesday, will freeze pay for Members of  Congress . . . and Federal employees.  Two million of the 2.3 million Federal employees—which  is 86%—do NOT  live  in  the  Washington, DC metropolitan region. They live  in what has been referred  to  fondly as  the  ‘‘real America.’’ The region with  the highest  percentage (37 percent) of Federal employees  is the South, home of such venerable institutions as  the Oak Ridge  research  lab, Red  Stone Arsenal, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The majority of Federal employees  work on defense and homeland security. They  guard our borders, protect the safety of airline  travel, fight forest fires, and track down online  child predators. Would it be unreasonable to  point out that passage of this bill could aid and  abet terrorists, cross-border gun runners, and  child pornographers?  We can all anticipate the anonymous PAC-  funded  television ads  that will  run against  those of us who oppose this ignominious legislation:  ‘‘Call and ask why Congressman X  voted to raise his own pay.’’ The other consequences of this bill, should it pass, are far  worse. Freezing pay of a workforce  that already receives 26 percent less than the private sector, according to the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, will  further degrade critical public  services and weaken an already fragile economy.  Federal employees’ pay has been frozen for  the  last  two years. While private sector pay  has grown, Federal pay has stagnated. By  denigrating  public  service  and  dismantling  Federal pay and benefits, we are crippling our  ability to recruit and retain the next generation  of top tier public servants. The victims of this  assault on public employees are our constituents—the public we are supposed to serve—  who rely on services provided by Federal employees every day in every American community.

41,House,112,-0.402,94,2012-02-01,Mr. DOGGETT.," I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I’m against fraud. I  think everyone here is against it. I’m  for what’s in this bill. That’s why I  voted for it back in December, and I’ll  vote for it next month, too, if that will  make for more cooperation here in the  House. I think, in a way, this is this  election year’s ‘‘welfare Cadillac.’’ And  I was against welfare Cadillacs, if there  ever were any of those, too.  This year, we have the ‘‘strip club  loophole’’ that has been defined as a  political term to suggest that we have  a  lot of problems with poor people  abusing their benefits. And to the extent that any poor person abuses even  a dollar of these benefits and keeps  those benefits out of the mouths of  hungry children, providing the clothes  those kids need to go to school, I’m  against that, and I plan to vote against  it today.  I  favor  comprehensive  legislation  against fraud in public assistance. It  concerns me when a pharmaceutical  company ends up having to settle for  $158 million in my home State of Texas  because they allegedly lied about drug  safety and bribed officials. It concerns  me when a pharmaceutical company in  the State of Texas has an $84 million  Medicaid fraud case brought against it.  I think we need to be concerned about  fraud in all of its aspects.  I’d feel better about this bill, however—because I think repassing it will  accomplish practically nothing, I’d feel  much better about this legislative effort if there were just an ounce of the  concern that is voiced about the very  few people who abuse these benefits, if  the same  level of concern were expressed about the many who are there  who are counting on the safety net, as  flawed and frayed as it is, who were  concerned about them and their families and their struggle to share in the  American Dream and were doing something to get that approved.  Yes, we approved this piece of legislation as part of a broader extension of  the Temporary Assistance  to Needy  Families program  in December. And  why hasn’t that become law?  It is separate legislation pending in  the Senate. It is also part of the broader legislation extending the provisions  on unemployment, on payroll tax relief. It ought to become law because we  need to be concerned about those families that are playing by the rules as  well as the very few who are not playing by the rules.  Now, the gentleman has said that in  some States action has already been  taken—California,  notably—to  deal  with the  few who might be cashing  their benefits at a casino or a liquor  store or whatever. Texas, my home  State, was cited as one of those States  that has already taken action. I think  that’s great. There’s not anything to  keep the States from taking action on  this already, if this is a serious problem.  Now, some of them have not acted,  not because of a lack of concern about  fraud but because the mechanics of correcting these electronic benefit cards  may actually be more expensive than  the cost that is being experienced by  the small number of people that might  abuse the card.  You take Arizona, for example. Governor Brewer has plenty of time to  shake her  finger  in the  face of the  President of the United States, to support legislation to discriminate against  Hispanic  families, who have been  in  that State for longer than she and her  family have been in the State. If she  thinks this is a serious problem, why  doesn’t she act at the State level, as  Texas and California and some other  States have done, to address this problem?  I would submit, while I don’t object  to this legislation in and of itself, that  the bigger problem that we face is that  the number of poor American families  has surged over the last 4 years, up 27  percent. Ten million people are below  what is officially agreed on as being  the poverty line. And this Temporary  Assistance to Needy Families program  provides a few of those families a little  bit of assistance, to have a chance to  turn their lives around until they can  find longer term employment to provide for their families.  b1350  How much money are we  talking  about that might be abused or wasted  at one of these facilities, which might  just happen  to be  the maintenance  crew at the casino that use their benefits there. Or it might just happen to  be the only store convenient in a poor  neighborhood is one that’s mostly selling  alcoholic  beverages,  that  they  choose to do that. How much might  they be abusing?  Let me tell you in my home State of  Texas the median benefit for a single  parent with two children is $244 for an  entire month to take care of those two  children,  16 percent of  the poverty  level.  I want to be concerned, yes, about a  dollar that is wasted. These are hard-  earned tax dollars that go into these  programs. We need to be concerned  about every cent of abuse. But we also  need to be concerned about the many  who stand to benefit, who stand to  have hope taken away if they don’t see  these benefits extended.  My concern about that is not merely  academic because of what happened  last year,  the bipartisan agreement  that had extended through many years  called  the  supplemental  program,  which was really a survival program  for Temporary Assistance  for Needy  Families in poorer States like Texas.  The Republicans chose to discontinue  that program even though it had enjoyed bipartisan support and had received support letters from a number of  Republican officials in our area. They  chose to not continue that, and that  has severely weakened the safety net  in our State. That’s not being continued.  Whether they intend to abandon the  entire Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families program or cut it back substantially, it’s hard to tell, given the  fact that they’re going only with the  very modest provisions of this bill and  not pushing to provide assistance to all  of those who need that help.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2012

44,House,112,-0.402,101,2012-02-01,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Chair, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, there are millions of  Americans currently in need of a long-  term care program and many more  that will require these services in the  future. Despite the great achievements  of our country, the U.S. lacks an affordable and ethical system of financing  long-term  care  services.  The  CLASS program is a significant step  towards finding a realistic solution to  this problem. However, many of my Republican  colleagues  have  taken  a  stance against CLASS without proposing any real solutions for long-term  care access in America, and I strongly  oppose H.R. 1173 and consider it to be a  blatant disregard of a growing crisis in  this country.  Madam Chair, Republicans continue  to propose repeal of various aspects of  the Affordable Care Act. We heard my  colleague from Georgia today. And how  many other times how many on the  other side have said, well, let’s just repeal the Affordable Care Act, let’s repeal pieces of the Affordable Care Act?  But  they never come up with any  meaningful alternatives. And the same  is true today. They’re talking about  outright repeal of CLASS without any  meaningful  suggestion  of  an  alternative.  My message to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle is that we should  mend the CLASS Act and not end it.  This country is already facing a long-  term care crisis, but the problem is  only going to get worse. As our population continues to age, an estimated  15 million people are expected to need  some sort of long-term care support by  2020. If we don’t solve the need for affordable long-term care in this country  soon, we will also jeopardize our entitlement programs. Currently, Medicaid  pays 50 percent of the cost of long-term  services, and that price tag is quickly  rising every year. The CLASS program  was designed to allow people to stay at  home and prevent the cost of nursing  home care that burdened Medicaid.  Now, I want to correct one thing. I  know in the Rules Committee some of  my colleagues talk about the administration’s position on this bill. The administration made it quite clear in a  hearing that we had on this bill that  they’re opposed to repeal of the CLASS  Act. They acknowledge that there are  workable solutions under the CLASS  program, but didn’t feel that they have  the legal authority—I stress legal authority—to  implement them. So the  Department  of Health  and Human  Services has more work to do, and I  have suggested on numerous occasions  that  the CLASS Advisory Council,  which is organized under the legislation, be convened in order to offer their  expertise.  The CLASS program is a framework  that will facilitate a solution to our  long-term care crisis. However, all I  continue to hear from my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle is that  Congress can’t do anything. It’s this  rise  the  negative attitude, the idea that Congress can’t address any problem. And I  just sincerely hope that my colleagues,  when they come to the table, come up  with a workable solution. Don’t just  tell me we have to repeal things, we  can’t do anything, and the government  can’t do anything. Cowardly running  away from the problem through repeal  is simply not the answer.  Overall,  the CLASS Act promotes  personal responsibility and  independence. Those are the values that you  talk about a lot. It allows the government to put choice in the hands of consumers while saving Medicaid dollars.  American families have too few long-  term care options, and they need our  help. Rather than repeal CLASS, we  need to continue the dialog in the development of a viable plan forward.  Again, let’s mend it, not end it. Moving forward with H.R. 1173 shuts the  door on a problem that simply cannot  be ignored.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2012

46,House,112,0.334,101,2012-02-01,Mr. LANCE.," Madam Chair,  I  today  in  support  of  repealing  CLASS Act.  In hearings before the Energy and  Commerce Committee, my colleagues  and I learned that the CLASS program  was a ticking time bomb fiscally, a new  entitlement program that Health and  Human Services Secretary Kathleen  Sebelius  has  said  is  ‘‘totally  unsustainable’’  financially.  Richard  Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote  in 2009: ‘‘Thirty-six years of actuarial  experience lead me to believe that this  program would collapse in short order  and  require  significant Federal  subsidies to continue.’’ And Senate Budget  Committee Chairman KENTCONRADhas  called the CLASS program  ‘‘a Ponzi  scheme of the first order.’’ To her credit, Secretary Sebelius in October called  for an end of the CLASS program, adding that there was not ‘‘a viable path  forward for CLASS implementation at  this time.’’  Madam Chair, we have a serious long-  term care problem that is driving patients into bankruptcy and weighing  down an overburdened Medicaid program. But before we can develop bipartisan solutions to address this important  issue, we must  first repeal the  misguided CLASS program. Only then  can we begin anew and properly address the long-term health care problem.  ",2012

49,House,112,-0.263,108,2012-02-01,Mr. KIND.," I thank my friend from  California for yielding me this time.  Madam Chair, I rise in support of the  resolution. I do so because I believed at  the time when the CLASS Act was inserted in the Affordable Care Act it  wasn’t a sustainable program. And sure  enough, when Secretary Sebelius and  those at the Department of Health and  Human Services had a chance to analyze it and try to implement it, they  reached the same conclusion.  I just hope that today my Republican  colleagues don’t take too much glee or  delight over the fact that this resolution will pass and it repeals yet another small section of the Affordable  Care Act, because just by repealing it  without replacing it doesn’t solve the  problem with  the  rising  long-term  health care costs that our Nation faces.  I know my  friend Dr. BOUSTANY  shares his interest in trying to find a  fix to this situation, and I hope that  the parties are able to come together  and address one of the paramount challenges that we’re still facing in health  care:  How  do  you  incent  young,  healthy people to invest in their long-  term health care needs? It’s difficult to  do.  And I appreciate the work by those  who supported CLASS, recognizing the  challenge that we faced and trying to  come up with a solution. This  just  wasn’t the answer.  And to my Democratic colleagues, I  never believed that passage of the Affordable Care Act—which  I did support—was the end-all, be-all for health  care reform. In fact, the great potential of the Affordable Care Act was the  vast  experimentation  that needs  to  take place in reforming the health care  delivery system and the payment system to learn what’s working and what  isn’t working and then drive the system to greater efficiency, better quality outcomes, and a better bang for our  buck. That, to me, is what health care  reform  is going to  look  like  in the  years to come. It’s going to be an ongoing effort trying to determine what is  working and what isn’t. The CLASS  Act, clearly, the way it was structured,  was something that wasn’t going to  work.  So I agree with the resolution today  that we should repeal it. It’s the same  conclusion the administration, having  a chance to look at it, reached themselves. But it doesn’t leave us off the  hook of trying to find a solution to one  of the great challenges of  long-term  health care in this country.  So I would encourage my Republican  colleagues—and I know many of them  share this sentiment, that this does not  end the work that has to go on. We’ve  got to figure out a way to start talking  to each other, listening, trusting each  other to come up with some solutions.  This isn’t that solution today.  ",2012
50,House,112,0.551,108,2012-02-01,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Chair, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1173, the Fiscal  Responsibility and Retirement Security Act.  It’s now clear that long before the  Democrats’ health care overhaul was  passed,  the  Obama  administration  knew that the CLASS Act was a seriously flawed program that could not be  implemented. For example, Medicare  actuary Rick Foster said way back in  June of 2009: ‘‘Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe that  this program would collapse in short  order and require significant Federal  subsidies to continue.’’  Yet these warnings went unheeded  and the CLASS Act remained in the  health care bill 9 months later because  it created an illusion of budget savings,  an illusion based entirely on the fact  that  it was designed to collect premiums for a full 5 years before it would  have to start paying benefits. Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of Federal health  care entitlement programs will more  than double over the next decade.  Madam Chairman, for the sake of our  Nation’s  future, we must get  these  costs under control. The CLASS Act is  an unsustainable program that, if it  ever begins operating, would inevitably  need a major taxpayer bailout. By repealing it today, Congress can send a  clear message that we are going to  start finding solutions to rising health  care costs instead of making the problem worse.  ",2012
51,House,112,0.524,108,2012-02-01,Ms. JENKINS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  There aren’t many areas where the  former Kansas Governor and current  Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and I agree,  but one thing that we do agree on is  that the CLASS Act portion of the  President’s  health  care  package  is  completely unviable and needs to be  stopped.  That’s why I was glad to hear the  Secretary backtrack on her prior support and pull the plug on the program,  and it’s why I support a statutory repeal of the CLASS Act today. This act  was designed as a new national entitlement for purchasing community-living  assistance services, and it was used by  this administration as a pay for to substantiate  their  faulty  claim  that  ObamaCare was going to reduce the  deficit.  However, as I and many others pointed out at the time, the deficit reduction claim was bogus and based on  budget  gimmicks  that  proved  false  when HHS began implementation. You  see, the CBO can only project the cost  of bills in a 10-year budget window, so  the Obama administration used a budget trick by setting up the CLASS Act  to begin collecting premiums in 2012  but not paying out benefits until 2017.  Great for years 1 through 10, but very  bad for years 5 through 15 or later.  This gimmick led CBO to report that  the program would reduce the deficit,  but it certainly doesn’t take a CPA to  realize that these initial savings can’t  be sustained over time. While we anxiously await the Supreme Court’s decision  on  the  constitutionality  of  ObamaCare’s  individual mandate,  I  urge my colleagues to support the repeal of this failed portion of the bill  today so we can get this budget gimmick off the government’s books.

54,House,112,0.561,122,2012-02-01,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my good friend and the good  doctor, my colleague from the State of  Washington, who made reference to, I  think, Groundhog Day.  Now, my name, Mr. Chairman,  is  PHILGINGREY, but as I sat here over  the last couple of hours listening to the  argument on the other side of the aisle,  I feel like Phil Connors, and that was  the weatherman. Bill Murray, if you  recall, played that role, the weatherman at Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,  covering Groundhog Day. And believe  me, we have been listening to Groundhog Day from my colleagues on the  other  side over and over and over  again, and it is indeed getting just a  little bit tiring.  My friend also said, the gentleman,  the doctor  from the State of Washington, Mr. Chairman, and I quote him:  ‘‘I’ve never seen a Congress that has  failed as much as this one.’’ Well, I’m  going to tell you, I have never seen a  provision of law in a bill that has failed  as much as the CLASS Act. And they  can beat this to death—and I think  they have done that, Mr. Chairman—  but I have in my hand here a summary  sheet  of  the HHS  analysis  of  the  CLASS Act over an 18-month period of  time.  And they have tried to model eight  different options to make this fiscally  solvent, and  required by  the  law—  thank goodness, thank goodness for the  amendment  from  the Senator  from  Rhode  Island,  the Honorable  Judd  Gregg, at the time chairman or ranking member of the Budget Committee.  The eight options, none of them work.  I mean, there are things like a work requirement. There are things like not  allowing anybody with a preexisting  condition to be in the program, allowing people with preexisting conditions  to be in the program but only eligible  for a benefit for 15 years, and on and on  and on. Actually, the one option that’s  not on this printout, I guess, is option  number nine, and that would be the option, Mr. Chairman, of requiring every  individual to sign up for the long-term  program under the CLASS Act.  Now, the question on all of these options was: Does the Secretary have  legal authority? And in most of the  eight: Not completely; HHS vulnerable  to legal challenge. Not completely; vulnerable to legal challenge. Not completely—again, vulnerable. No authority. No authority. No authority. No authority.  Well, number nine, individual mandate, making everybody sign up for it,  yes, got the authority to do that. She  could have done that. But I’m sure that  my colleagues and her advisors and the  administration probably—and  I state  this rhetorically. Do you want another  mandate to which the American people  can rail against us in the next election? And she is smart enough to know  that option number nine was not unacceptable.  So, again, we could go on and on. We  could do this  for another couple of  hours and  continue  this Groundhog  Day ruse, but, as I said earlier, Mr.  Chairman, what part of ‘‘no’’ do they  not understand?  b1710  Now, look, when this amendment was  added at the last moment back in 2009  by the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Health, Mr. PALLONE, during the Energy and Commerce Committee debate  on the CLASS Act, Chairman PALLONE  stated, and I quote him: ‘‘I can’t stress  enough that we are not actually setting  this  up. We  are  simply  suggesting.’’ That was  the end of  the  quote. In fact, Chairman PALLONEasserted  that  the program would not  take effect until subsequent legislation  was passed.  Well, Mr. BARTON, who, at the time,  was the ranking member of the overall  Committee of Energy and Commerce,  said this: ‘‘Well, reclaiming my time, I  am  going  to  support  the  Pallone  amendment without binding anybody  on my side to support it, with the understanding that if this moves forward,  there will be a hearing on this in this  committee, and there will be bipartisan efforts to flesh it out. Do I have  that assurance  from the chairman?’’  And Mr. PALLONEresponded, ‘‘You certainly have my assurance.’’  And then the chairman, HENRYWAXMAN, overall chairman of  the committee said, fine with me, but he is the  subcommittee chairman.  We never had one hearing. We never  had an opportunity to flesh it out.  Defeat this amendment.  ",2012

58,House,112,0.339,136,2012-02-01,Mr. WALDEN.," Mr. Speaker, let me  make a couple of points about this motion to instruct, which I oppose.  Section 2123, which is the issue here,  allows up to 10 States per year to apply  for waivers to test innovative ideas to  help people get a job, to help people get  back to work, so it’s only up to 10  States. And waiver programs would  have  to be cost neutral,  rigorously  evaluated, and then we could understand the policies.  Look, I think the folks at home in  my great State of Oregon are just as  compassionate,  if not more so, than  what happens here  in Washington. I  think they can be creative, too,  in  helping.  And, in fact, in 2011, Oregon launched  its version under a waiver of the National  Career Readiness  Certificate  program. Now, what that did was certify 10,760 work-ready  individuals  in  the State that they have the appropriate math, reading, and other skills  necessary to get back and contribute  to the workforce.  b1940  Now, that hiring tool brought nearly  400 businesses, communities, and workers together and then simplified the  job-search hiring process. These are the  kinds of innovative ideas that we could  use to actually help people get a job.  This  is a horrible economy. We’ve  had 11 recessions since World War II.  This is the worst one in terms of coming out of it. So the policies that have  been in place the last couple of years  haven’t work.  The American people were promised  if we spent a trillion dollars we don’t  have, including interest on the stimulus, unemployment wouldn’t go above  8 percent; and yet here we are, record  unemployment,  record deficits. Trillion-dollar year after year after year  deficits under the Obama administration, and people still out of work, highest poverty level since the great anti-  poverty campaigns began. This has to  change. We have to get people back to  work.  One of the issues that we’re going to  deal with in the conference committee,  I hope, you want to do something about  jobs, then let’s stop this Boiler MACT  rule from going into place. The EPA  Boiler MACT rule threatens to cripple  American manufacturers. We’ve  lost  more jobs there since back to, I think,  World War II; and this rule by EPA  would cut another 200,000 jobs.  So let’s roll back the job-killing regulations. Let’s get Americans back to  work, and let’s leave creativity to the  States to help us find better ways to  take care of those who are unemployed.  ",2012
59,House,112,-0.283,136,2012-02-01,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  The reason why I offered this motion  is to protect unemployment insurance  for the millions of jobless Americans  that qualify for it.  At the end of the last session, the  House considered H.R. 3630, a bill that  would extend the payroll tax cuts as  well as the unemployment insurance.  Unfortunately, the bill also  included  provisions that would undermine the  unemployment  insurance program as  we know it today.  While I disagree with many of these  provisions, my motion to instruct focuses on one particular provision: the  provision would roll back a requirement that States must spend all unemployment  funds solely on unemployment benefits.  Now, I know that there might be  some who disagree with the size of the  unemployment program and how many  weeks individuals should be able to get  their unemployment benefits. But  I  think we can all agree that money intended to help the unemployed make  ends meet while they’re  looking  for  work should not be used for something  else.  There are several reasons why maintaining the integrity of the unemployment program makes sense.  First, there are still more than 13  million Americans out of work as a result of the worst economic downturn  since  the Great Depression. These  Americans rely on unemployment benefits to feed their families and pay the  rent until they can find another job.  To allow States to use these funds intended to support these  families  for  programs could result  in those who  have lost their jobs to receive a benefit  that does not help them make ends  meet and would be useless.  Some might argue that this provision  will give States more flexibility to implement the unemployment program. I  strongly  support  giving States  the  flexibility to implement national policies in a way that makes sense to some  of the States, but there’s already a  great flexibility in the unemployment  insurance program.  States already choose and adjust employers’ tax rates, benefit levels, and  duration and eligibility criteria. This  provision goes too far and jeopardizes  unemployment  benefits  themselves,  and it won’t help the millions of unemployed Americans get back to work.  Second, unemployment benefits help  individuals find other jobs. According  to CBO, extension of unemployment insurance benefits in the past few years  increased both employment and participation in the labor force over what  they would have been otherwise.  Recent research from the Brookings  Institute  concluded  that  unemployment insurance does not increase the  time that people remain unemployed.  They found that unemployment benefits may actually keep more people in  the labor force through its requirement  that beneficiaries seek work.  The fact is unemployment benefits  remain a crucial resource for American  workers who lost their jobs as a result  of the Great Recession and not because  of their job performance.  Using unemployment insurance funding for any purpose other than unemployment benefits for struggling families simply makes no sense.  Third, unemployment benefits stimulate the economy. CBO identified increasing aid to the unemployed as one  of the policies that would have the  largest effect on output in employment  and therefore trigger economic growth.  That’s because individuals who receive  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:50 Feb 02, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00136 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01FE7.140 H01FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 7 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2012
60,House,112,0.591,143,2012-02-01,Mr. CONAWAY.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from Colorado for allowing me  to join in; and although I’m not a part  of  the  freshman class,  I hope  they  won’t toss me out of the Chamber as a  result of that indiscretion.  I wanted to walk us through kind of  the process by which TransCanada has  gone  through  trying  to  laboriously  apply and comply with all of the rules,  regulations, and hoops that anybody  who tries to do a project of this scope  has to go through.  They began  in September of  2008  when they filed their application for a  permit to build this pipeline. As has  been mentioned, the State Department  would not be involved in this at all except  for the  fact that this pipeline  crosses an international border. If this  were just within the United States, the  State Department and the President  would be out of the loop in this instance. But because this is an international problem, then the State Department gets a whack at this deal.  In April 2010, the State Department  issued their draft Environmental Impact Study. Then, a couple of months  later, in June of 2010, EPA weighed in  with the results of their technical review and said that the draft Environmental Impact Study was deficient and  didn’t provide the scope and the detail,  if necessary,  for decision-makers  to  make their mind up. Bureaucratic nonsense for stopping things from going  forward, so that it allows one group of  folks in the administration to brag on  how hard we’re pushing on this issue,  while all the time they’ve got a backstop at  the EPA  that knows  that  they’re not going to move anything  forward.  And then October 2010, State Department issued a supplemental draft Environmental  Impact  Study.  Only  in  America can you come up with these  kinds of titles to simply laying a pipeline across  this country. Again  the  EPA weighed in and said, no, no, no,  this supplemental one is deficient, and  you’ve got to continue to give us information; although, when asked a little  later  on  that month, Secretary  of  State Clinton was asked at a press conference, kind of where are we with respect to the pipeline approval process,  she commented that we’re inclined to  say ‘‘yes’’ to the pipeline.  And then in April 2011, the EPA again  said in a filing that the supplemental  draft Environmental Impact Study was  deficient.  Finally, by August of 2011, the State  Department issued its final Environmental Impact Study, allowing for a  30-day public comment and a 90-day  agency comment. And of course it was  during  this agency comment period  that  the State Department decided  that a new route was necessary, that  the original route that was planned  and the alternatives going across the  Ogallala, the 13 alternatives that were  assessed, that this one really was the  best, that somehow a new route was  necessary and that gave rise to the  charade that we saw played out where  the President decided he was going to  wait until after the election, and then  Congress weighed in and said, no, you  need to make that decision sooner.  The State Department’s decision to  go or no go on it has to be based on a  finding that the pipeline is not in our  national interest. Transporting this oil  of almost 1.4 million barrels of crude  and bitunium across this country to  U.S. refineries would have to not be in  the United States’ best interest. And,  in fact, that’s what the State Department found. After we passed the law requiring the President to make a decision, the State Department suddenly  decided that building this pipeline was  no longer in the national interest and  allowed the President then to say what  he said. The President’s wrongheadedness on this issue couldn’t be more self-  evident on its face.  I want to talk real quickly about the  safety issue. You hear a lot about that.  I  come  from west Texas—Midland,  Odessa, San Angelo. There are thousands and thousands of miles of pipeline crisscrossing my part of the State.  In fact, there are three oil pipelines  that run through the front yards of the  people who live across the street from  me. And we’ve lived there for almost 15  years now, not a bit of trouble with the  pipelines. And they’re inspected all the  time, both inside and out and observed  from the air, and this type of stuff. So  pipeline safety is not an issue.  b2050  Drilling safety, by the way, I just  wanted to pitch this in real quickly.  When I left my home yesterday morning at 5:45 to come here, as I was closing the garage door, I could see the  lights on the crown of a drilling rig less  than a half mile from my house that’s  in operation. It’s been in operation for  about 4 or 5 months now drilling wells  that are actually that close to my  house, and it’s being drilled inside the  city limits of Midland, Texas.  So when we talk about not in my  backyard or all of the other kinds of  reasons why people don’t want oil and  gas production around them, I come  from a part of the State where it’s a  badge of honor, and, in fact, it’s helpful  on the 20th of the month each month  when the royalty checks show up. So  this  industry has a great record of  being able to operate soundly not only  in the drilling and exploration phases,  but also in the production and transportation issues across.  Let me give you one quick thing, and  I’ll close. The Wall Street Journal, on  the 19th, had made a pretty good statement. It said:  The central conflict of the Obama Presidency has been between the jobs and growth  crisis he inherited and the President’s hell-  for-leather pursuit of his larger social policy  ambitions. The tragedy is that the economic  recovery has been so lackluster because the  second  impulse keeps winning. Yesterday  came proof positive with the White House’s  repudiation of the Keystone XL pipeline,  TransCanada’s  $7  billion  shovel-ready  project that will support tens of thousands of  jobs if only it could get the requisite U.S.  permits. Those jobs, apparently, can wait.  thank  the genI  PETEOLSON And a couple of paragraphs  later,  very succinctly, said, ‘‘This is, to put it  politely, a crock.’’  ",2012

The only reason we had the  Department of State  involved  is because it crosses a national boundary.  So you can see the pipeline right here  where it extends. I already have some  pipelines, and I know the gentleman,  from Texas, will be addressing  the  Chamber  shortly  and  share even more about this route and  the different pipelines that we’re dealing with.  But again, here  it  is. Right here.  That’s the only reason the State Department is involved. The only reason  that they had a hook to get involved,  and, as you can see, the hook was  yanked and jobs were killed.  I would like to follow up as well with  an editorial from The Detroit News,  The Detroit News on the 20th of January. Detroit, Michigan,  particularly  hard hit by economic tough times over  the past several years. This is the editorial:  President Barack Obama is willing to wait  and wait and wait  for  20,000 desperately  needed jobs. For someone whose operating  slogan is ‘‘We can’t wait,’’ it’s curious that  President Obama is willing to wait and wait  and wait  for  the Keystone XL  pipeline  project and the 20,000 desperately needed jobs  it promises. If the  ‘‘can’t wait’’ President  keeps dragging his feet, he will hand the Chinese yet one more competitive advantage  over the United States.  That’s the Detroit News, January 20.  Again, just a couple weeks ago.  I know the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. OLSON) has been very involved in  the Energy and Commerce Committee.  He’s been standing up for his State, energy security jobs that would be created. And I’m sure he knew this already, but in Texas alone, the development of the Alberta oil sands could create as many as 27,000 jobs over the next  4 years.  With that, I would yield to the gentleman from Texas.  ",2012

63,Senate,112,0.34,157,2012-02-01,Mr. HOEVEN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from South Dakota for organizing the colloquy and I also thank  the good Senator from Nebraska for  joining us as well. I appreciate working  with them on this project, which is not  only vital to our State but to our country.  As the Senator from South Dakota  said, this project is critically important to our country for a number of  reasons. First, it will create tens of  thousands of jobs. There will be a $7  billion investment, not one penny of  which will  be Federal Government  spending but all private sector investment. The Perryman Group projected,  when they did a study on the job creation, that it would create 20,000 construction jobs right away; it would create upward of 100,000 spinoff jobs as  they expand refineries and with the  other economic activity that  is created. Some might dispute those  job  numbers, but any way we look at it,  tens of thousands of jobs will be created by the private sector, which is  why it has strong union support at a  time when we have 13-plus million people out of work and we need the jobs.  As the Senator from South Dakota  said, it will generate hundreds of millions in tax revenues from a growing  economy, from more economic activity. The last I checked, it is pretty important at the local, State, and Federal  levels to have those revenues coming  in. In addition, it will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  With what  is going on  in Iran—and  they are threatening to blockade the  Strait of Hormuz—and with gas prices  at $3.50 a gallon, roughly, and going up,  it is important to consumers and the  businesses of this country that we use  the oil in this country and from our  closest ally, Canada, rather than relying on the Middle East.  The third point is, this oil will be  produced. If we don’t build the pipeline  capacity to bring it to our refineries to  be refined, it goes to China. That is a  fact. It will be produced. It will either  go to China or it will come to us.  I have this chart to give a history of  the project because, as the good Senator from South Dakota said, this has  been under review  for more than 3  years. TransCanada, the company that  is trying to build the pipeline, built  this Keystone Pipeline already. That is  this red line on the chart. That project  was approved in 2 years. Again, Keystone XL has been under study more  than 3 years. The sister pipeline has already been built, and that was approved in 2 years. It comes from Alberta, Canada, to the refineries in the  Patoka, IL, area.  The existing project, as we can see,  comes  through North Dakota—that  was when  I was Governor—through  South Dakota, and down through Nebraska. The Keystone XL comes just to  the west.

64,Senate,112,-0.473,164,2012-02-01,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, I am  delighted to rise today in support of  the STOCK Act and  in  support of  amendment No. 1481 that my colleague  from Ohio has put forward to address  the fundamental issues of conflict of  interest that reside here in our body.  Let me start with the defining principle; that is, there should not be one  set of rules for Members of Congress  and a different set of rules for ordinary  Americans. I think the citizens of the  United States of America  in  every  State understand that principle. Everyone else in the country has to abide by  rules that say they cannot profit in the  stock market from privileged information. There is no reason those rules  should not apply to Members of Congress.  Indeed, Members of Congress at any  given time can hold access to immense  amounts of information from previews  of economic forecasts, from advanced  knowledge of events affecting major  employers in their State, to classified  defense information that might have  implications for, for example, the oil  market.  Under the right circumstances, all of  this  information can provide  insider  knowledge of which ways the markets  are likely to move. So I am delighted  that this body has voted overwhelmingly to move forward with the STOCK  Act. It would make clear that trading  on congressional knowledge is no more  acceptable than any other form of insider trading, and it would also make  financial disclosures  for Members of  the Senate searchable online, and that  is also very important in the principle  of transparency.  These are important steps, but they  do not go far enough. Let’s remember  that insider trading is extraordinarily  difficult to define and extraordinarily  difficult to prosecute. Where did you  get that information and what truly  motivated you to make a particular  trade in a stock? And because of that,  when the conflict of interest exists, we  have stepped forward to say that this  must be addressed. We ask members of  the executive branch to put aside their  individual stocks in situations where  the conflict arises. We ask our staff  members to set aside and divest themselves of their stock when a conflict of  interest arises. We applaud the  fact  that partners in law firms dealing with  cases set aside and divest themselves of  stock when  the conflict of  interest  arises. But somehow we have not seen  fit to have the debate about our own  activities.  My colleague put it very well when  he said: Why should we allow Members  of Congress to hold oil stocks and then  vote on issues affecting oil companies?  Why should folks be able to invest in  renewable energy companies and then  fight for tax credits that benefit renewable energy companies? Why should we  allow Members to hold stock in pharmaceutical companies and then be deciding on issues such as whether we  should have competition in the pricing  of pharmaceuticals for Medicare? It is  a direct conflict of interest.  Any Member of this body who says, I  never even gave a passing thought to  the  impact on my  several-hundred-  thousand-dollar  investment  in X, Y,  and Z, I must say, well, I honor their  thought, but  it doesn’t address  the  issue about us as an  institution because no one else outside these walls  will believe you didn’t think a little bit  about the impact on your personal financial portfolio when you voted for  that tax credit or you voted for that  policy  that made  your  investment  worth a lot more than it would have  been otherwise.  The people in America are far ahead  of us. During January,  I had seven  townhall meetings in which the STOCK  Act came up several times, and I asked  for feedback. I said: How many folks  here believe Congress should live by  the same rules of insider trading that  everyone else in America lives by? And  there was not a person who raised their  hand in support of having a separate  set of rules for Congress. Then I asked  the question: Do you think we should  go further? Should Members not be allowed to hold individual stocks given  that they are making decisions that affect the values of the stock? Again universal support that Congress should address this conflict of interest in the  same way we have addressed it for the  executive branch or for our staff members. So the citizens of this country understand this.

67,Senate,112,-0.37,178,2012-02-01,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, Senator KIRK and I have introduced the  Visa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act.  This is a piece of legislation near to  my heart. For those who have known  me, they have known I have fought  long and hard for Poland to become  free and independent. I think about the  dark days of martial law in Poland,  when we worked to support the solidarity movement in Poland and remove  the yoke of communism. And after Poland emerged from the Iron Curtain, I  worked with many of my colleagues to  secure Polish  democracy  and  bring  them into NATO, securing their future  in Western Institutions.  This legislation would help provide  Poland a path to entry into the visa  waiver program. It would eliminate the  need for Polish citizens to obtain a visa  to travel to America. As the granddaughter of a woman who came to  America  from Poland over 100 years  ago, it would warm my heart to know  a grandmother from Gdansk would no  longer need a visa to visit her grandchildren in Baltimore.  This legislation does much more than  just strengthen our relationship with  Poland. It is a jobs bill. The visa waiver program makes America open for  business for more tourists from allied  countries. This can have a profound  impact. South Korea entered the VWP  in early 2009. In 2010, there was an increase of 49 percent in arrivals to the  United States from South Korea, which  created $789 million in new spending  and supported 4,800 new jobs.  If Poland becomes eligible  for the  visa waiver program and has a similar  increase  in visitors,  it would create  $181 million in new spending and 1,500  new  jobs. It’s good  for business and  good for the economy.  Finally, it would strengthen America’s national security by  improving  how we protect our borders. To participate in the visa waiver program, countries must agree to stronger passport  controls, border security, and cooperation with American law enforcement—  making it harder for terrorists to use  these countries as entry points to the  United States.  This legislation reinforces the program as an important component of  national security by placing member  countries on probation if any of the  VWP requirements are not met and requiring a country’s removal if it does  not fulfill its requirements within two  years.  The  legislation also reinstates the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security’s  Waiver Authority and a new cap on  visa refusal rates will be set at no more  than 10 percent, allowing the Secretary  to recognize those nations that have  met U.S. concerns on passport security, law enforcement cooperation, and  border security. By admitting countries that have greater security standards for their travelers, the State Department can focus its limited consular  resources on higher risk nations.  Poland has long been a friend to the  United States, sending two of its finest  heroes, Kosciusko and Pulaski, to fight  in the Revolutionary War for America’s freedom. In recent years, Poland  has stood besides the United States in  the aftermath of September 11, sending  troops to fight alongside Americans in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  Poland has overcome a melancholy  history to become a vibrant and growing democracy. This legislation helps  cement that relationship while improving America’s  security and creating  new jobs. I look forward to working  with my colleagues to secure its passage.  f  REMEMBERING RAY REID  ",2012
68,Senate,112,0.402,178,2012-02-01,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to honor the life of Ray Reid, a  devoted champion of Arkansas and its  citizens, affectionately known as Arkansas’s ‘fifth congressman.’  Ray dedicated his life to public service, serving more than 30 years in the  Army  including  three  wars—WWII,  Korea and Vietnam—before retiring as  a colonel and continuing his commitment to this country serving for more  than 23 years as chief of staff for three  of Arkansas’s Third Congressional District Congressmen—John Paul Hammerschmidt, Tim Hutchinson and Asa  Hutchinson.  As a loyal staffer, Ray was an ambassador of and to Arkansas, going above  and beyond to help resolve issues constituents had with the Federal Government. Under his guidance, Congressman Hammerschmidt laid the groundwork for successful constituent service.  Ray recognized that the key to good  governing and good public service is  that you treat everyone fairly and set  political differences aside.  Congressman  Hammerschmidt  recently said of his  former right-hand  man that he was the best administrative assistant in the House during his  service. Upon his retirement Congressman Asa Hutchinson  said Ray was  known to be one of the most knowledgeable men in Washington.  When I was elected to Congress in  2001, Ray went out of his way to help us  get on the right track. His skills and  experiences were vital to helping us  build a strong foundation to serve the  people of the Third District.  Despite working in the minority for  much of his career, Ray managed to accomplish great things for Arkansas because of the long-lasting relationships  he  built. Certainly Ray  saw many  changes  in  the Third Congressional  District during his years of service to  Arkansas and many can be credited to  his efforts. Ray had a hand on many infrastructure projects  including Interstate 540 and the Northwest Arkansas  Regional Airport.  In a recent interview, Congressman  Hammerschmidt fondly recalled Ray’s  passion  for the Natural State:  ‘‘Ray  really loved Arkansas,’’ he said. Ray  helped change the landscape of Arkansas. His impact is far reaching and his  legacy is evident in the Third Congressional District.  The State of Arkansas has lost a true  friend who went to great lengths to  make it a better place.

69,Senate,112,-0.235,185,2012-02-01,Mr. BEGICH.," The STOP Act is the  Stop the Outrageous Pay for Fannie  and Freddie Act,  the  bill Senator  THUNEand I introduced this morning.  Our bill comes in the aftermath of a series of events that began last November when reports surfaced that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA,  approved nearly $13 million in bonuses  for 10 executives, that enterprise that  supervises Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac.  In response, Senator THUNE and  I  spearheaded a bipartisan letter, signed  by 58 other Senators to the FHFA, Acting Director Edward DeMarco and the  Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner.  We expressed outrage over these pay  levels, and I believe our message was  heard. Almost 3 months after our letter  was sent, the pressure was clearly on.  Government  regulators were cutting  the pay of the executives they hired to  replace the departing heads of Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac.  Also,  in  response  to  our  efforts,  House Financial Services Committee  chairman SPENCERBACHUS introduced  legislation  suspending  these bonuses  and  limiting  future  compensation  packages for Fannie and Freddie employees. In November, his committee  passed the bill by a vote of 52 to 4.  The Begich-Thune STOP Act  is a  commonsense approach to address the  outrageous Wall Street-like bonuses  and pay that have occurred at Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac for far too long  and which continue to occur to this  day, even after billions  in taxpayer  bailouts. I wish to make it clear, this  bill will not change the life much for  nonexecutives. The pay structure for  the everyday, hard-working Americans  at Fannie and Freddie will stay almost  as it is today. They are not the target.  However, it will change the life for executives such as Peter Federico, who  earned $2.5 million in 2010 and had a  target compensation of $2.6 million in  2011. This was at the same time he was  gambling that struggling homeowners  would be unable  to  refinance  their  high-interest mortgages to record-low  interest rates. This  is unacceptable,  unethical, and I know this body will  not tolerate it.  Here is how our legislation works: It  simply places Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac employees on the same pay scale  as the financial regulators at the FDIC  and SEC, a pay scale long established  in Federal law. It is a pay scale called  the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act. This is  the pay scale we are basing our legislation on.  Under our approach, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac employees cannot be paid  more than employees of other Federal  financial  regulatory agencies. Right  now the highest paid person under this  pay scale makes $275,000 a year. This is  our pay cap. While this  is a  lot of  money, it is not any more than what  the cops, as we call them, on the financial beat make to ensure that ordinary  Americans are protected and get a fair  shake.  Our legislation also stops any future  bonus payments that go beyond the cap  established  in this  legislation. Also,  any bonuses that have been granted  but have not yet been paid will be  stopped. Any money in excess of the  cap we have established will be used to  pay down the national debt. Finally,  our  bill  requires  that Fannie  and  Freddie salaries be made available to  Congress and the public through the  Senate Banking Committee and  the  House Financial Services Committee.  I am aware of the criticism of this  bill and I would like to address them.  Senator MCCAINoffered an amendment  yesterday that freezes bonus pay. I support Senator MCCAIN in his efforts. In  fact,  I  cosponsored  this very  same  amendment the last time it was offered. Many of my colleagues have  asked me why our bill does not freeze  bonus pay. Our bill is based on a broad-  based approach that looks at the entire  pay structure within Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac.  While  it tackles the huge bonuses  and  pay  policies  for  executives  at  Fannie and Freddie, we believe the everyday employees earning modest salaries should be occasionally rewarded  for outstanding work so it ensures they  get the small bonuses that may be effective for them. But to clarify, these  would be modest bonuses that would  never exceed the pay cap established in  this bill.  I have also heard the concern that  Fannie and Freddie will not be able to  attract the right kind of talent if they  cannot pay people multimillion-dollar  compensation packages. I hate to state  the obvious: Fannie and Freddie have  proven the opposite. They paid executives outrageous compensation and yet  still failed by Alaskans and all Americans. They needed hundreds of billions  of dollars in taxpayer bailouts and still  ended up in conservatorship. This sends  an unsettling message to millions of  hard-working people who are  struggling to make ends meet. They have  taken Alaskans’ tax dollars in the form  of bailouts. Yet when my constituents  in Anchorage or Kotzebue or Fairbanks  or Juneau needed help to avoid foreclosure or refinance their loans, Fannie  and Freddie often turned their backs.  Finally, I have this response to people who say Fannie and Freddie executives need to earn millions: Whatever  happened to the concept of public service or to the notion that it is an honorable calling to work on behalf of your  friends and your neighbors? There are  lots of dedicated, hard-working professionals at Fannie and Freddie who believe in that notion, and they are doing  their absolute best to help American  families to afford the American dream  of owning and keeping their homes.  The Begich-Thune bill makes sure  this hard work  continues and  that  their bosses at Fannie and Freddie  come to work every day not with visions of dollar signs but instead with a  clear eye of doing what is right for all  Americans.  I urge all Members to support this  commonsense bipartisan bill. Senators  TESTER, MCCASKILL, BAUCUS, BLUNT,  GRASSLEY, HOEVEN, ENZI, and SCOTT  BROWN have already  joined Senator  THUNEand me as original cosponsors. I  wish to thank them for their support.

70,Senate,112,-0.4,185,2012-02-01,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, we  are  in an age of tight budgets and  tough choices, and I rise today to introduce legislation that would address  some loopholes in the Tax Code that  provide  ways  for  Americans  with  superhigh  incomes to pay  lower tax  rates than are paid by regular hardworking, middle-class families. These  middle-class  families  feel  they  are  struggling to get by but then find that  some people with extremely high incomes are actually paying a lower, all-  in federal tax rate than they are. To  them, it defies common sense, and I  think for all of us it defies common  sense. Americans deserve a  straight  deal, and right now they are not getting one from our tax system.  To see the unfairness of our current  tax  system, we don’t have  to  look  much further than the national headlines. According to a Forbes magazine  report last fall, billionaire Warren Buffet ‘‘paid just 11.06 percent of his adjusted gross income in Federal income  taxes’’ in 2010. Mr. Buffet is the first to  express  his  dismay  at  this  circumstance and acknowledges that the  rate he pays is lower than the tax rate  paid by his own secretary. Mr. Buffet  has  called  for a  correction of  this  anomaly, and I agree with him. So does  President Obama, who, in his State of  the Union Address, said Washington  should stop subsidizing millionaires. I  agree.  We should celebrate the success of  people who are earning $1 million and  more a year, but we don’t—particularly  in this time of tight budgets and hard  choices—need to subsidize that. The  legislation I have introduced today, the  Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, would  ensure that those with extremely high  incomes pay at least a minimum Federal tax rate of 30 percent. I thank Senators AKAKA, BEGICH, LEAHY, HARKIN,  for being  initial cosponsors of this measure.

In 2001, this high honor was  created to pay tribute to those who reflect the  ideals and beliefs held by Dr. Martin Luther  King,  Jr. The honorees of  this esteemed  award are exemplary citizens who have made  momentous contributions to their community in  a variety of ways. These individuals have not  only dedicated  themselves  to bettering  their  community, but have also worked selflessly to  bring together people of different backgrounds,  cultures, and creeds.  This award  is unique  in  that  it does not  honor people only in one area of service, but  rather highlights  individuals who have made  significant contributions  to society, each  in  their own way. Recipients of this year’s award  have done everything from establishing a college preparatory program  for minority  students, to founding an environmental program,  to creating a 5K race in honor of a fellow Marine killed  in action,  to providing  free health  and education classes, among many other accomplishments.

73,,112,0.343,206,2012-02-01,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my distinct privilege today to recognize an extraordinary  individual  from Michigan’s  10th  Congressional District. On February 17, 2012,  family,  friends and neighbors of Mr. Gordon  Fuerstenau will gather at the Richmond Township Hall to celebrate his dedicated and honorable record of public service. In total, Gordon  has served the Township of Richmond located  in northern Macomb County for an impressive  27 years, having  first been elected as  the  Clerk in 1984 and then appointed to the position of Supervisor in 2003 which he held until  2011.  As a  former  township supervisor myself,  I  can personally attest to the hard work, long  hours and steadfast commitment it takes to efficiently operate and manage  the day-to-day  business of a township. The job can be difficult at  times, but  the rewards  far outweigh  any roadblocks faced along the way. There is  nothing quite like the satisfaction of seeing the  work you have accomplished to improve the  community in which you live. Ultimately, you  know you are making a positive difference and  enhancing  the quality of  life  for  the generations to follow.  Gordon’s resume includes a long list of accomplishments demonstrating his  leadership  skills and impeccable integrity. He has served  on the City of Richmond’s Wellhead Protection  Team which helped protect drinking water utilized by area residents. He also was a key  player  in  fostering  the amicable  relationship  with  the City of Richmond  through his work  with the Richmond Volunteer Fire Department,  and  triumphing key environmental  issues  to  help maintain  the rural setting  that  is especially unique to Richmond Township.  Mr. Speaker,  I am grateful  for  this opportunity  to  properly  acknowledge  Gordon  Fuerstenau’s strong record of outstanding and  invaluable public service to Richmond Township. I commend him on this very special occasion and offer my best wishes on many  more successes in the future.  f  RECOGNIZING MR. JACK SCAROLA  ON HIS DEDICATION TO HELPING  END HOMELESSNESS  HON.

74,,112,-0.565,206,2012-02-01,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it  heartened me to learn that Jack Scarola was  recognized by the Lord’s Place for his work in  the  fight against homelessness  in  the West  Palm Beach area of Florida. Jack is a partner  in a prestigious West Palm Beach  law  firm  who has supported homeless persons in the  community since he moved to the area over  30 years ago. He was a founding member of  the Lord’s Place, an organization I am proud  to represent in my Congressional district that  is dedicated  to breaking  the cycle of homelessness through engagement, housing, education, and employment programs. He still is  active with the Lord’s Place, just having finished serving as chairman of their Board of Directors and having served on  the Board  for  more than 20 consecutive years. I appreciate  the work that he has done, and I would like to  extend my deepest gratitude for his commitment to serving the community.  The Lord’s Place recently honored Jack with  the Ending Homelessness Award. During the  award ceremony, a 1983 radio broadcast featuring  the organization’s efforts was played.  Although the clip was a distant memory, Jack  instantly remembered giving  the  interview.  It  was early in the movement to help the homeless, and he and some other volunteers were  collecting donations on  the steps of a  local  church. Jack was surprised at the community’s  support  for  their cause. Since  that  time, he  has worked to turn this support into a community-wide effort to help other people.  For over 30 years, he has helped to make  the Lord’s Place fight against homelessness in  Palm Beach County. In 2010, the Lord’s Place  supported over 500 homeless men, women,  and children. Jack played a critical  role  in  building this organization.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mr.  Jack Scarola for receiving the Ending Homelessness Award from the Lord’s Place. He is  truly a selfless  individual  that has dedicated  his life to helping those in their greatest time  of need.

NEXT  STOP, ATHENS?’’ BY MALLORY  FACTOR  HON. TIM SCOTT  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 1, 2012  ",2012
76,,112,0.657,213,2012-02-01,Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina.," Mr. Speaker,  I submit an article on behalf of Mallory Factor  expressing his opinion regarding the need for  significant reforms and spending cuts in spite  of the social unrest they may cause.  . NEXTSTOP,  ‘‘OCCUPYWALLSTREET. . ATHENS?’’  [By Mallory Factor]  In the past  few weeks Americans have  watched with  interest,  bemusement  and  anger as protests and sit-ins on Wall Street  have sparked similar demonstrations around  the country. With vague goals of combating  corporate greed and calls to rectify all manner of social and economic inequality, this  movement seems, to the press at least, to  capture a mood of deep discontent among the  American people.  But if you think a thousand protesters on  Wall Street is a trouble sign for our nation,  wait until you see the civil unrest that follows the reforms and cuts to government  programs needed to bring our national debt  under control. Just look at Greece, where  government is being reformed, drastic cuts  are being made—and the society is unraveling. In Greece a series of severe austerity  measures has been imposed as conditions for  recent bailouts by the International Monetary Fund and the other members of the single European currency, the euro. Yet the  economy continues to spiral downward.  And with each new round of reforms in  Greece, misery and unrest are on the rise.  Strikes and angry street protests are a daily  occurrence, as unions fight decreases in pay  and benefits for their workers, students protest the lack of opportunity and ordinary  citizens resist reforms and tax increases. The  confrontation with authorities is impeding  business and destroying tourism, deepening  the crisis further.  Some of that struggle is for naught. The  Greek government couldn’t reduce austerity  measures if it wanted to. Fiscal policy is now  out of its hands and likely to remain so for  decades, perhaps generations.  And while most Greeks agree the bloated  state must be streamlined, they’re stiffening  their resistance to reform. That’s why many  in the euro zone believe Greece must default  in order to rebuild a more efficient government.  America  isn’t  in that predicament—yet.  But there are cautionary lessons to be lifted  from the outraged streets of Athens. As the  Greek example shows, government largesse  is easy to expand but difficult to cut back  without inflaming people.  For years our politicians have framed increases to government benefits as compassionate and obligatory. Now all that overspending must be pared back and government programs reformed to curb the federal  deficit. But each round of needed cuts and reforms  will  likely  cause misery—in  an  amount substantially greater than the happiness generated by spending increases.  Behavioral economics, which uses social  and psychological factors to predict a population’s decision-making behavior, captures  this paradox in two fundamental principles.  First, the principle of ‘‘loss aversion’’ explains that people hate to lose something  more than they value receiving something.  So, even if many Americans don’t value existing government programs and spending  very highly, they will likely be very unhappy  about the loss of those same goods and services.  Second, even if you streamline our government and make programs more efficient, the  ‘‘endowment effect’’ predicts that people will  still oppose changes to the benefits they receive. This is because people tend to value  the goods and services they have more than  they do equivalent replacement goods and  services. The endowment effect makes  it  very difficult to exchange existing benefits  for new ones and thus to ‘‘reform’’ government programs.  Whether we cut spending and make reforms now or later, course correction will be  difficult and even potentially dangerous to  our nation’s stability. Just look at the resistance of public employees in Wisconsin,  Indiana and elsewhere to relatively minor  cuts to see how people will contest vigorously any decreases to their benefits and  programs.  Behavioral economics teaches us that any  time we make changes and reduce government benefits and programs, we can expect  people to be very upset about those decisions—and likely resist them. Still, we need  significant reforms and deep cuts to put the  U.S. on track toward a balanced budget.  Paring back government will undoubtedly  cause misery and social dislocation. However, ‘‘death’’ by a thousand small cuts will  intensify civil unrest and may produce revolutionary fervor unlike anything we’ve seen  in America in our lifetime. Our nation will  be better off by reforming our system radically, in a single dramatic turn, rather than  piecemeal—or face something very like the  furious streets of Athens.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 2011–2012 RECIPIENTS OF THE  ‘‘IN HOPE FREEDOM  RINGS  FOUNDATION’’  SCHOLARSHIPS RECIPIENTS  HON.

The American people, I guess, don’t deserve a budget.  When the Senate, on the 24th of January,  surpassed  the  1,000th day  that  they’ve yet to put a budget forward,  HARRYREID said, Guess what, American public? You really don’t need one.  Even though this organization, this  government, is running at a 40 percent  deficit,  the Senate majority  leader,  HARRYREID, says, Don’t worry about  it. We don’t need a plan, and we don’t  need a budget, even though small businesses have a budget, county and State  officials have a budget, and you and I  at home have a budget that we have to  depend upon to guide us as we move  forward throughout our year.

Let’s make those Wall  Street bankers sign up to work with  Habitat for Humanity to restore housing  in neighborhoods across our Nation. Wouldn’t that be sweet justice?  Once they’ve paid back the billions  that they owe the American people,  whose homes they’ve raided of equity,  let’s put them to work.  Wouldn’t it be great to see the CEO  of Goldman Sachs, I think his name is  Lloyd Blankfein, out there with buckets and scrub brushes? Come to Toledo;  come to Cleveland; come to America,  the  part  you’ve  hurt  so  deeply.  Wouldn’t it be great? Let him be joined  by Josh Bolten, who was there when  the Bush administration handed the  toxic mortgage paper to the people of  the United States.  Well, come on down, Angelo Mozilo,  from Countrywide. I think a little hard  work would help you a whole lot. How  about Bank of America? How about the  CEO  there? How  about  JPMorgan  Chase?

While I believe every day should be  HIV awareness day, February 7 is an  important day to recognize the effect  this epidemic has on African Americans. Although only 14 percent of the  U.S. population, African Americans account for almost half of those living  and dying with HIV and AIDS in this  country.  This year’s theme is ‘‘I am My Brother’s Keeper, I am My Sister’s Keeper.’’  People of faith know it is unacceptable  that a woman of color in the United  States is 15 times more likely to be living with HIV than a white woman her  age. People of faith know that it’s unacceptable that our young men, particularly gay and bisexual men, are  most affected in this country. We cannot allow this crisis to continue.  We have the tools we need to end the  AIDS epidemic. I urge everyone to get  tested and take steps to protect themselves from the virus.  I call on members of the faith community, the private sector, health organizations, community leaders, teachers, parents, and the media to come together like never before.  The story of African Americans  is  one of resilience. I have great hope and  expectation that we can once again  persevere and we can stamp HIV and  AIDS from the face of the Earth.  f  b1240  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R.  3581, BUDGET AND ACCOUNTING TRANSPARENCY ACT  OF 2012  ",2012

But actually,  we’re doing something more than just  simply raising the issue. We’re addressing it and solving this problem as well.  I appreciate the fact that the gentlelady raises the fact about a list of experts who have questions about this.  Well, I have experts too, but I actually  have the name. A former CBO Director,  Doug Holtz-Eakin, now with American  Action Forum, writes us here to express support of H.R. 3581.  The gentlelady may also know, since  she serves on the committee, when it  comes to this issue that we had this  issue up in committee recently, and we  asked the current CBO Director does he  support with regard to moving towards  fair value. And he said that is the more  appropriate basis of evaluating the obligations of the Federal Government.  So we have the experts.  AMERICANACTIONFORUM,  January 30, 2012.  Hon. PAULRYAN,  Longworth House Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANRYAN: I am writing to express my support for H.R. 3581, ‘‘The Budget  and Accounting Transparency Act of 2011,’’  in particular those provisions that would incorporate fair value accounting (FVA) into  the federal budget process. As you are well  aware, a core objective in federal budgeting  is to accurately display the scale and timing  of the expenditure of taxpayer resources.  Since sovereign tax and borrowing powers  should always be used judiciously, there is a  premium on doing so as accurately as possible.  In some cases this is straightforward. Consider, for example, a discretionary appropriation. The scale of the overall commitment is  clear and in some cases it is straightforward  to budget the timing of the ultimate outlays  as well. Federal credit programs, however,  present particular difficulties. The timing of  budgetary cash flows differs dramatically between direct loans and federal loan guarantees—even in cases when the ultimate economic impact is identical. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) took an important step forward by equalizing the timing of  their budgetary treatment Direct loans and  loan guarantees are both recorded  in the  budget during the year in which the commitment is incurred, regardless of the duration  and timing of the federal assistance.  This was an important step in the right direction. However, estimating the scale of required taxpayer resources remains problematic. In particular, the ability of loan recipients to make timely and complete repayments will be  influenced by  future  individual, household, and economy-wide economic conditions. In the same way, the obligation of the federal government to undertake guarantee payments will be driven by  similar forces.  While such future individual and economic  conditions are uncertain, reliable techniques  exist to estimate the likely size of the taxpayer obligation. Unfortunately, FCRA needlessly restricts the analyses to credit risk—  the probability of failure to fully repay—  while ignoring the fact that the timing of  those failures matters enormously. As the  past few years have starkly reminded every  American, the need to tax, borrow and otherwise deprive the private sector of another  dollar has far greater implications during  the depths of economic distress than during  periods of robust economic growth. Adoption  Of FVA would rectify this oversight  I recognize that significant reform to budget procedures  should not be undertaken  lightly. However, my views are informed by  the fact that during my tenure as director,  the Congressional Budget Office undertook a  number of studies of the implications of accounting  fully  for economic risks  in the  budgetary treatment of  financial commitments like credit programs. In example after  example (pension guarantees; deposit insurance; flood insurance; student loans; and assistance for Chrysler and America West Airlines), it becomes clear that an incomplete  assessment of risks leads to misleading budget presentations and may engender poor policy decisions. FVA would be a significant  step toward  improving this  informational  deficit.  My views are echoed by a wide array of  budget experts. In March 2010, CBO issued a  new report recommending the use of FVA for  federal  student  loan  programs  on  the  grounds that budget rules do ‘‘not include  the costs to taxpayers that stem from certain risks involved in lending.’’ In addition,  the Pew-Peterson Commission on Budget Reform proposed  ‘‘fair-value accounting’’  for  credit programs and the President’s National  Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform advocated for reform of budget concepts that would more accurately reflect  costs.  In addition to these research views, there  is a track record of success. FVA has already  been used  successfully  for  the budgetary  treatment of the Temporary Asset Relief  Program of 2008 (TARP) and the federal assistance to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Last but not least H.R. 3581 would also fix  another shortcoming of FCRA; namely that  the administrative costs associated with federal operations are not included in the budget cost and must be provided for elsewhere.  H.R. 3581 would require that administrative  costs  (called  ‘‘essential preservation services’’) to be accounted for up-front, thereby  balancing the playing field.  In sum, I believe that the Congress should  adopt  fair value accounting and,  in particular, pass H.R. 3581 in a timely fashion. I  would be happy to discuss any aspect of this  issue in greater detail.  Sincerely,  DOUGLASHOLTZ-EAKIN.  With that, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  MCCLINTOCK).  ",2012

86,House,112,0.69,37,2012-02-07,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Mississippi  for  putting this time together. And I rise  today in support of National Marriage  Week.  In  so many ways,  from  so many  sources, marriage is under attack in  America. When we consider the many  social  problems  facing  our  country  right now, the erosion of marriage and  family is at the core of many of them.  Scholar Michael Novak once famously  referred to the family as the ‘‘original  Department of Health, Education, and  Welfare’’ because of  its role  in providing for the needs of all its members  and, particularly, the next generation.  Study after study has shown the tremendous advantages for children and  society as a whole when there is a sustained presence of mothers and fathers  in the home. Families in which mothers and fathers strive to nurture their  children together have advantages over  every other family form that has been  studied to date.  Today we are seeing that marriage is  increasingly  in  trouble  in America.  High  rates  of  divorce,  nonmarital  childbearing,  and  single  parenthood  were  once  problems  primarily  concentrated  in poor communities. Now  the American retreat from marriage is  moving  into the heart of the social  order, the middle class. There is a widening gulf between the middle class,  where a sharp decline in marriage is at  work, and the most educated and affluent Americans, where marriage indicators are either stable or are even improving.  As unwed childbearing continues to  climb, risking continued social breakdown and  increased government dependency, national leaders should be  encouraging stable  family  formation,  not redefining marriage. I call upon  Congress  to  recognize  the  intrinsic  good that results to all of society when  husbands and wives strive to uphold  their marriage vows and raise children  in loving and stable homes.  I again want to thank the gentleman  from Mississippi for putting this time  together on such an important issue.  ",2012

100,Senate,112,0.351,72,2012-02-07,Ms. AYOTTE.," Madam President,  I  certainly share the concerns of my colleague from Missouri, and I share the  concerns of my constituents  in New  Hampshire and citizens across this Nation who see the recent rule issued by  the administration for what it is, an  unprecedented, unnecessary affront to  religious liberty in our country.  I wish to say at the outset that this  issue  is not  limited to the Catholic  Church.  The  administration’s  new  health care mandates on religious institutions  impact all religions. Religious freedom is a foundational American  right enshrined  in our Bill of  Rights. The  first amendment to our  Constitution makes clear  that Congress shall make no law respecting an  establishment of  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  Unfortunately, I see the administration chipping away at these bedrock  freedoms as it engages in a troubling  pattern here with respect to this rule,  and I think we saw that the President’s  new mandate on religious institutions  highlights the deep flaws in the health  care bill.  This unconstitutional law was moved  through Congress and signed by the  President 2 years ago without the type  of due consideration, transparency, or  accountability we would all expect, and  we  have  been  suffering  the  consequences since. It is highlighted with  what we see with these recent mandates from Health and Human Services.  I wish to share some of the concerns  my  constituents  have  raised  about  these mandates  that were  recently  issued by Health and Human Services.  There is a letter I received this week  from William Edmund Fahey, who is  the president of Thomas More College  in Merrimack, NH, and he says: To condition the availability of medical benefits upon a community’s willingness to  violate a cardinal teaching of its faith  effectively prevents the full practice of  its religion; and thus, again, violates  the  free exercise of a constitutional  liberty.  He pleaded with our delegation, the  New Hampshire congressional delegation, and he said: I hope you will see  that the mandate undermines the Constitution, compromises the integrity of  the  government  and  abuses  the  foundational principle that free associations form an essential part of the  social fabric of the United States.  We are fortunate in New Hampshire  to have a number of very effective  Catholic  institutions  and  organizations. We have the Catholic Medical  Center in Manchester which serves so  many  in the Manchester community  and surrounding areas. The Catholic  Medical Center has also expressed concerns about the mandate, saying: It  would force us to offer services that  were against our ethical and religious  directive or force us not to offer insurance altogether.  They added: Neither are acceptable  options.  The president of one of our great colleges in New Hampshire, Saint Anselm  College, President Jonathan DeFelice,  said: In a country and a State that values and respects individuals’ rights to  exercise their religious beliefs and live  according  to  their conscience’s best  light, it is simply appalling to think  that this mandate is anything other  than an unprecedented incursion into  freedom of conscience.  I have heard many concerns from my  constituents, and I would hope that  Health and Human Services would stop  what it is doing right now, this mandate that places religious institutions  in this impossible position, with this  impossible choice of violating  their  core beliefs in order to comply with a  mandate or dropping employee insurance coverage altogether. We should  not be putting these organizations that  do great work throughout this country  in that position. And, again, this is not  an issue that just applies to the Catholic Church; this applies to all religious  institutions.  I would ask my colleague from the  State of Missouri: As a result of our  concerns about the actions of the administration, we have offered legislation to address this, and what does that  legislation do in order to make sure  that this mandate does not go forward?  ",2012
101,Senate,112,0.43,72,2012-02-07,Mr. BLUNT.," That is a good point. I  wish also to say that this is not about  just about one set of religious beliefs.  The current discussion is about specific  items in a health care plan, but there  are lots of faith-based groups with different views of how you deliver health  services that have been working on  these issues for some time now, and I  met with a lot of these groups. This is  an issue of conscience, whether it is  the Catholic Church,  the Christian  Science Church, the Seventh Day Adventist Church,  the Baptist Church  that I am a member of. There may be  different views of this, but the views  are not views that can be put forth by  the government, and that becomes the  government view.  There was a recent Supreme Court  case, Hosanna Tabor Lutheran Evangelical Church and School v. Equal Employment  Opportunity  Commission,  where the Court voted 9 to 0 that faith-  based institutions have privileges that  others do not have because that is what  makes them  faith-based  institutions.  The hiring decisions, the firing decisions, the workplace decisions are different because if they are not different,  it  is  just another school or another  hospital that might happen to have a  theology department or might happen  to have a chapel once a week. That is  what it is.  Senator AYOTTE, Senator RUBIO, and  I have worked on various ways to approach this. We offered a bill some  weeks ago on these issues of conscience  that would create a respect for rights  of conscience. The Respect for Rights  of Conscience Act, which was drafted  early last year, has the full support of  the major groups that are concerned  about  these  conscience  issues. The  Christian Medical  Association,  the  Becket Fund, and others have said that  we need to be concerned about these  issues, whether it is a hiring decision  now or a health care decision, and what  do we do to protect health care providers  and  insurers,  including  purchasers, from being forced to violate  their own principles by buying a policy  or  offering  a  policy  that  provides  things they don’t believe in their faith  group are the right things to offer.  I saw one of the President’s advisers  early this morning beginning to back  away from this and say: Suddenly this  one year has become—we are just seeking information during this year.

Mr. Wesson made a significant contribution  to contemporary Black History when he served  as Chief of Staff in the office of Los Angeles  County 2nd District Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite  Burke,  the  first—and  only—African  American female ever elected to the LA County Board of Supervisors.  His first elected office came in 1998, when  he was elected to the California State Assembly and was re-elected in 2000 and 2002. His  colleagues in the California State Assembly—  by a unanimous vote—elected Mr. Wesson  the second African American in the 162-year  history of the State of California to serve as  Speaker of the California State Assembly.  After he left the Assembly, he was elected  to represent  the 10th Council District  in  the  City of Los Angeles in 2005, capturing over 80  percent of  the vote. His City Council colleagues called him  ‘‘a consummate bridge  builder.’’ Last year, he was elected by his City  Council  colleagues—once  again  unanimously—to serve as President of the Los Angeles City Council, becoming the first African  American to do so since Los Angeles was incorporated in 1850.  On January 3, 2012, City Council President  Wesson took office and presided over his inaugural meeting of the city council. My friend  and  former colleague, Herb, personifies  the  storied and triumphant history of the African  American community not just in Los Angeles,  but around our great Nation.  f  CIVILIAN PROPERTY  REALIGNMENT ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. EARL BLUMENAUER  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 6, 2012  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 1734) to decrease  the deficit by realigning, consolidating, selling, disposing, and improving the efficiency  of federal buildings and other civilian real  property, and for other purposes:  ",2012
104,,112,-0.428,93,2012-02-07,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Chair, while I agree  that the federal government must find a way to  dispose of unused federal government property properly, I voted against H.R. 1734, because this legislation turns the federal government into a worse partner than it already is.  There is a way to save federal government  dollars and reduce our property holdings while  working in cooperation with local governments  and the local population. Rather than working  with  local governments and  respecting  the  plans they have implemented, this legislation  ignores plans that are already in place, and  does not give community leaders a chance to  participate in any part of the property realignment. Additionally, the legislation overrides important  environmental  regulation  that  has  helped protect our communities for decades.  It is frustrating that my colleagues refused to  work in a bipartisan fashion, or even to work  with  local governments,  to develop a better  way to dispose of excess federal property. I  look forward to working with my colleagues to  find a solution we can all agree on.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR. DICK MONTEITH  HON.

105,,112,0.309,93,2012-02-07,Mr. DENHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge and honor the life of a beloved  leader  in  the Stanislaus County community,  Mr. Dick Monteith, on his 80th birthday.  Dick Monteith was born in Los Banos, California, spent his early years attending Merced  and Stanislaus County public schools, and  graduated from Turlock High School. He continued his education at Menlo College and  Stanford University, where he graduated with  a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology.  Soon after graduation, Dick started a  life-  long career  in agri-business as a partner  in  Monteith Tractor/Truck Company. He subsequently served in the Marketing Department of  Gallo Wines, and then as a Sales Representative for Weyerhaeuser Company. He retired as  General Manager of Sales and Distribution for  Middleton Packaging prior to seeking his first  elective office.  He was elected to the California State Senate representing the 12th District in 1994 and  then again in 1998. In 2006, Dick was elected  to  the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors. During his time on the Board, he witnessed  the collapse of  the housing market,  which caused a reduction  in property  taxes.  The county was faced with the worst budget  crisis since the Great Depression. Yet, even  during the darkest days, the Board of Supervisors accomplished many projects, including  the Crows Landing-West Park Project, Federally Qualified Healthcare Look Alike, New  Residency Program, and the sale of the Behavioral Health Center to DMC.  Some of the Capital Projects that have been  completed during his tenure include the completion of Gallo Center for the Arts, the Empire  Pool Project, the Expansion of the West Modesto Clinic, a new Animal Shelter, the Salida  Library Remodel Projects and  the ground  breaking for the Juvenile Commitment Facility.  In addition, he has attended 189 Board meetings,  considered  4,331  Resolutions  and  served as Chairman of the Board in 2011.  Dick and his wife Jeanine make their home  in Modesto. He has  two sons,  three step-  daughters, and four grandchildren.  Dick  is a member of Christ Community  Church and serves on the boards of Modesto  Gospel  Mission,  Youth  for  Christ  and  Stanislaus County Prayer Breakfast.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in honoring  Dick Monteith  for his unwavering  leadership  and  recognizing  his  accomplishments  and  contributions. Dick serves as an example of  excellence to those in our community.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 7, 2012  ",2012

Receiving a bachelor’s degree from the College of New Rochelle, along with a Master’s of  Public Administration from Ohio State University, Ms. Kurtz has dedicated her life to economic development and the betterment of the  community around her. Her work has spanned  the course of twenty-eight years, with assignments in Connecticut, Ohio, and since 1995,  Northern New York.  I have known Adore and her husband Perry  since they moved to New York, and we have  worked on many projects which brought much  needed employment to our community. During  her  tenure as CEO, she has helped  to  increase TDC’s net worth by 248 percent, and  doubled the number of staff. She was among  those who were instrumental in bringing manufacturers like Nova Bus and Bombardier to  our community. At a  time when our country  faces a jobs crisis, Ms. Kurtz demonstrates a  distinguished record in job creation and economic development.  While I am saddened to see such an exceptional individual and good friend retire today, I  will be forever grateful for the work that she  has done for my constituents and New York’s  23rd district. As reflected in her accomplishments, her dedication and commitment to public service will continue  to  live on  for many  years to come. I trust much more of her time  will be spent with her husband, children and  grandchildren.

112,House,112,0.528,6,2012-02-17,Mr. BARTON of Texas.,"  I want to  thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding.  I’ve been in the House, this is my  28th year, 14 years in the minority and  now I’m in my 14th year in the majority. I don’t believe I have ever voted  against a rule when I was in the majority, but I’m going to vote against this  one. I’m also going to vote against the  underlying bill.  I’m not saying anything disparaging  about the leadership on both sides of  the aisle and the leadership in both  bodies, but we are taking money away  from the Social Security trust  fund  and we are substituting an IOU that  may or may not ever be repaid. So on  principle alone, I think we should at  least shoot straight with the American  people. So I will vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill.  On the rule, when we became the majority, we, the Republicans, we promised  the American  people  that we  would be more open and more transparent than the previous majority that  was headed by Speaker PELOSI; and one  of our primary promises was that we  would give the American people 3 days,  or 72 hours, before any bill was voted  on the House floor. This rule waives  that principle. And I know it’s expedient and I know that there is majority  support, as you can tell by the debate  for both political parties on this bill,  but I think to go back on a principle to  the American people, that what we  vote on, especially bills that are very  important, should have enough time  that people can look at what’s in the  bill.  I don’t think that’s something  that you compromise for political expediency.  So I will vote ‘‘no’’ against this rule  for the first time in my career in the  House of Representatives as a member  of the majority when a majority rule is  up, and I would hope that this is a one-  time exception  that we violate  the  principle that we promised when we became the majority.  ",2012
113,House,112,-0.408,6,2012-02-17,Mr. ENGEL.," I thank my good friend  from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS).  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  the legislation being considered today;  however, I really just need to say this  is not the agreement I would have written.  I recognize the importance of making  sure our physicians don’t receive a 27  percent pay cut, and I have been very,  very vocal on the doc fix. I think it’s  something that is warranted, is much  needed, and is fair and equitable, but I  VELA´ZQUEZ strongly oppose the cut in DSH funding  to pay for this package.  As a member of  the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce,  we fought hard to have DSH in the Affordable Health Care Act. And in my  home city of New York City, teaching  hospitals are very important and they  help  the people who are poor, and  that’s why DSH funding is so important.  We’ll always need a safety net for  hospitals to provide that safety net to  our most vulnerable citizens, and cutting DSH payments only makes the  task harder. This will certainly have a  harmful effect on my district. I really  just have to say that.  But, ultimately,  I’ll vote  for  this  agreement because, at a time when the  Great Recession  is  finally  showing  signs of ebbing and the recovery is taking root, we cannot remove $1,000 from  middle class taxpayers’ pockets and expect the recovery to continue.  So I am very glad that we will still  have a payroll tax cut. I’m glad that  Democrats have been in the forefront,  along with the President, of pushing  for this payroll tax cut.  We need to do more to help the working people and middle class people in  this country, not only the rich. The  poor, the middle class, the working  class people, they’re the ones that need  help, and  this bill  is helping  them  today.  This conference report is also a slap in the  face to our federal work force. Public workers  serve  their country and without  them, our  country would not be what it is today. Without  their efforts, we would not be  the  leader  in  medical  research. Seniors would not have  their Social Security benefits processed as  quickly. People waiting on  their  tax  return  would have to wait longer.  Yet, time and again—while asking no sacrifices of large oil companies or the wealthiest  income earners—we are asking  the  federal  work force to bear the brunt of paying for extension of unemployment  insurance benefits.  How can we expect  to recruit and retain a  qualified, effective  federal work  force  if we  continue to decimate their pay and pensions,  and attack them for serving their country?  But ultimately, I will vote for this agreement  because at a time when the Great Recession  is finally showing signs of ebbing, and the recovery  is  taking  root—we  cannot  remove  $1,000 from middle class taxpayers’ pockets  and expect the recovery to continue.  This bill also fully extends unemployment insurance benefits. While  I strongly disagree  with the pay-for, at a time when our country is  showing strong signs of  recovery,  I cannot  vote against benefits  for  those who are still  looking for work.  I urge my colleagues to support this agreement.  b0950  I’ll just say again, Madam Speaker,  that again this body was able to reach  a compromise today. The unfortunate  fact is that the Republican Party still  seeks to implement policies that unfairly favor the wealthy. Let me identify some of those people.

115,House,112,-0.386,20,2012-02-17,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I commend  my colleagues for reaching an agreement on  a longer term extension of the payroll tax cut.  While this bill is not perfect, it does provide  the average American middle-class family with  an additional $1,000 over the year through the  payroll tax cut extension, it continues Unemployment  Insurance  through  the end of  the  year, and prevents cuts in Medicare physician  payment rates. More than 160 million Americans will benefit from the payroll tax extension  and millions of seniors using Medicare will be  able  to continue  to see  the doctor of  their  choice.  Despite  the assistance  this  legislation will  provide to millions across the country, I have  reservations about a number of problematic  provisions. The Republican Majority continues  to put the burden of the recession on Federal  public servants. By requiring an increase in retirement payments by new employees,  this  legislation  further  undermines  the  Federal  Government’s ability to attract and retain the  best talent. The vital services provided by the  more than 2 million civilian employees cannot  be compromised. It is time this Congress recognized  the service  that Federal employees  provide to our senior citizens and the disabled,  to our military service members and veterans,  and to our overall safety and health. In addition, the reduction in weeks of unemployment  insurance benefits starting in May will put a  hard burden on some of America’s hardest hit  families. Lastly, the cuts to reimbursements for  hospitals who serve large numbers of un-and-  under-insured patients will put the load of the  cost directly on the hospitals providing care.  Despite  these concerns,  I support  this bill  today because the extensions help this country continue on a path of job creation and economic growth. We are well in to the second  session of  the 112th Congress and still my  colleagues on  the other side have  failed  to  bring meaningful  jobs  legislation before  the  House  for a vote.  It  is  time  the Republican  Majority responded to calls from the American  people to strengthen our workforce for middle  class families.  ",2012
116,House,112,-0.345,20,2012-02-17,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I voted  in  favor of the conference agreement on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of  2012 because I believe it is necessary for our  nation’s continued economic recovery, which  still remains fragile. Economists of every stripe  have endorsed the three major components of  the bill which will provide some additional confidence  for both  consumers and business.  However, I have serious concerns about parts  of the compromise, chiefly the lack of a permanent repeal of the sustainable growth rate  (SGR) formula and the funding sources for the  ten-month SGR ‘‘patch.’’  Medicare cuts to community hospitals and  skilled nursing facilities included in the compromise  threaten  the already  thin  financial  margins  these  institutions are operating on.  Also included in the compromise is the elimination of $5 billion  from  the Prevention and  Public Health Fund created by the Affordable  Care Act. These cuts will stifle progress on  disease prevention which in the long-term is  the best way to reduce health care spending.  And, the fact that these programs will be cut  to pay for a short term fix of a broken SGR  formula that was passed into law nearly two  decades ago and has proven to be totally infeasible, is particularly galling.  While  the window of opportunity  to repeal  the SGR permanently  in  this package has  passed for now, Congress still has an obligation  to enact a permanent  fix  to  this  flawed  policy when  the  ten-month  fix expires. We  know now that the longer a permanent fix is  delayed,  the more precarious our system of  care for seniors and veterans will become. On  a positive note, growing bipartisan, bicameral  support  for abolishing  the SGR  is building,  paid for with savings from the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)  funds. The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed these  funds are available which provides a promising opportunity in the coming months to repeal the SGR finally once and for all.  Fixing this long standing problem must be a  bipartisan priority for this Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle towards a permanent solution to the SGR that gives our doctors, seniors  and veterans  the  long  term certainty  they  need—and deserve—in their care.  ",2012
117,House,112,-0.341,20,2012-02-17,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina.," Mr. Speaker,  I am proud to stand with the President and  working Americans  today by supporting  this  measure, which will add an average of $1,000  to the paychecks of working North Carolinians  this year, extend unemployment benefits  for  Americans who have lost jobs through no fault  of their own, and ensure seniors on Medicare  will be able to see their doctors. After a year  in which Republicans  in Congress  took  the  country  from one manufactured crisis  to  the  next, this bipartisan agreement is a step in the  right direction and at a time when so many  families are still struggling to make ends meet,  it may be our last chance to help revive the  economy as we head into an election year.  Once again, however, House Republicans  are asking us to rob Peter to pay Paul, and  the positive economic impact of this measure  will be undermined in part by their senseless  and misguided insistence that federal employees, hospitals, clinical  laboratories, and preventive health programs must bear the cost.  Unemployment benefits are paid out during  true economic emergencies and should not require offsets. And to the extent we should offset the cost of the other programs extended in  this measure, we should do so by asking corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay  their  fair share—not by asking middle-class  Americans and providers of health care who  have already sacrificed in the name of deficit  reduction to do even more.  I’m particularly troubled by the demonization  of  federal workers by Republicans  in Congress, which has reached a crescendo of late.  To be effective and respond to the needs of  the American people, government needs to attract the best and brightest to public service.  Federal employees have already been subjected to a pay freeze, and now we are asking  them to open their wallets again to pay for unemployment benefits  for workers who have  lost their jobs.  I  cannot  in good  conscience oppose a  measure  that puts money  in  the pockets of  American workers, protects our  fragile economic recovery, and maintains the safety net  for unemployed workers and health care  for  seniors. But we simply must do better if we  are to maintain the promise of expanding opportunity for working and middle class Americans.  ",2012
118,House,112,-0.519,20,2012-02-17,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  express my concerns with a health provision  in the Payroll Tax Compromise. Even though  we  have  successfully  protected Medicare  beneficiaries from significantly increased premiums on Medicare patients with  incomes  below $40,000, and prevented attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act’s mission of  expanding coverage to millions of Americans,  the Payroll Tax compromise still contains provisions  that will hurt middle-class and economically disadvantaged Americans. Specifically, I am concerned about the inclusion of  cuts  to Medicare  laboratory services. Under  this legislation, clinical lab payment rates will  be cut by an additional 2 percent in 2013, on  top of the cuts that were included in the health  reform law. These new cuts also rebase the  lab fee schedule, resulting in lower rates for  clinical lab services for years to come.  In some  independent clinical  laboratories,  especially those serving rural communities or  nursing home populations, 80 percent or more  of  their patient-base  consists of Medicare  beneficiaries. The cuts being  faced  threaten  their practice’s existence and no additional  cuts—big or small—can be absorbed without  adversely  impacting patient  care. Medicare  payment amounts for clinical laboratory services have already been reduced, in real terms,  by about 40 percent over the past 20 years.  While clinical laboratory testing is less than 2  percent of all Medicare spending, it has been  subject to significant freezes in payments and  cuts over the last decade.  Clinical laboratories are an important part of  the health care system. Their tests inform up  to 70 percent of a doctor’s medical decision-  making. As the first point of intervention, laboratory tests serve as the foundation for the  diagnosis and clinical management of conditions like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and infectious diseases. These  clinical laboratories do more than just draw a  person’s blood. They are a major part of the  medical process.  Independent clinical  laboratories also are  essential for those who must depend on the  laboratory’s mobility  for  testing.

148,Senate,112,-0.351,48,2012-02-17,Mr. SCHUMER.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of Jesse Furman, who is a  nominee for the District Court in the  Southern District.  I have had  the  good  fortune  to  present to the President more than 13  nominees for the Federal bench, every  one of them is incredibly accomplished.  Each represents the best of the bar  that the State of New York has to  offer. I believe in excellence, moderation, and diversity, which are the three  standards I use. But on the standard of  excellence, Jesse is no exception to my  standard  of  excellence.  In  fact, he  doesn’t just meet it, he shatters it. He  is one of the most brilliant lawyers in  the country. He is amazing. The fact  that he wants to serve our Federal  Government on the bench is a tribute  to us all. It is a tribute to our country  and to him.  How about moderation? This is the  issue I wish to speak most to my colleagues about. Who was his prote´ge´ in  many  ways?  Judge Mukasey.  He  worked for Judge Mukasey as a clerk  and then as attorney general. A lot of  people on this side of the aisle, including myself, have real differences with  Judge Mukasey, but if we cannot support Jesse Furman for the nomination,  then we cannot support anybody because this nomination could have come  from a Democrat, it could have come  from a Republican, it could have come  from a  conservative,  it  could have  come  from a  liberal. He  is truly a  mainstream thinker, and so this vote  will be  indicative. Because  if Jesse  Furman cannot achieve cloture, then  our system is so paralyzed we better go  back to the drawing board because it  will mean no district court judge can  be approved, none.  So  I would ask Senators on both  sides of the aisle to support him. I  know we have a number of our Republican colleagues who have said they  might support him, and I hope they  will. We had a good vote in the Judiciary  Committee  on  Jesse  Furman.  Again, he is truly excellent, endorsed  by his former coclerks on the Supreme  Court, including those who clerked for  Justices Rehnquist, Thomas, O’Connor,  Kennedy, and Scalia.  John Podhoretz, a conservative columnist, wrote that Furman should be  confirmed because he is  ‘‘terrifically  knowledgeable, entirely respectful of  views that differ from his, and utterly  without an axe to grind.’’ That is why  he passed without discussion out of the  Judiciary Committee without dissent.  Please, colleagues, a vote for Furman  will show that we can come together  certainly on a judge of such moderation. A vote against him will say the  system is irreparably broken.  I thank the Chair.  I yield the floor.  f  CONCLUSION OF MORNING  BUSINESS  ",2012
149,Senate,112,0.356,48,2012-02-17,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  rise to urge my colleagues to vote no  on cloture on Senator REID’s amendment No. 1633 to the highway bill. The  bill we are getting ready to vote on  puts the other titles into the highway  bill  from the Commerce Committee,  Finance Committee, and Banking Committee.  I am going to object on the grounds  that the Commerce Committee title is  not the title that should be included in  this bill. What happened is that there  was a partisan amendment that was  added to a markup very late that the  minority had not had a chance to work  out before it went to the markup. We  thought it wasn’t going on the markup,  but it did go on the markup before we  were able to have the input and work it  in a better way, which has been our  usual position in the Commerce Committee.  The bill would create an unfunded,  unlimited discretionary grant program  that has divided  the  transportation  community. It will add a new Assistant  Secretary for Freight Planning and Development and a whole new office in  the Department  of  Transportation.  This is a part of the bill that certainly  none of the Republicans can support,  and it caused a party-line vote in the  Commerce Committee.  Additionally, the bill that will be before us contains provisions that would  create two new programs within the  Research and  Innovative Technology  Administration that would cost taxpayers $28 million annually to administer, and the CBO estimates the underlying bill would cost $615 million for 10  years  including  these  two new programs. That would be about double  what the levels are for this program in  today’s terms. So the next 10 years  would have been at $318 million if we  had kept it at static levels, which we  are doing in most other parts of the  highway bill. Instead, the bill we are  voting on today would more than double that to $615 million over the next 10  years for RITA.  We don’t have to have this kind of  partisan effort on the bill. Our Commerce Committee has been very good  at bipartisan work. I see the Senator  from California on the floor who has  worked in a bipartisan way with the  Senator from Oklahoma on the underlying bill. But the Commerce bill that  came out was not bipartisan.  We have worked hard with Senator  ROCKEFELLERand we have informed all  of our Members on both sides to get a  consensus, and we got one. We got a  consensus that would have taken the  Freight Act part of it that set policies  for new freight studies—we did that.  That part would be in the compromise  bill. It keeps the funding in line with  current levels in the Research and Innovative Transportation Administration. But those compromise provisions  that Senator ROCKEFELLER and all of  our  staffs  of  the whole  committee  worked on are not in the bill we are  voting on today.  We worked together relating to the  importation  of motor  vehicles  and  equipment  in  the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration  reauthorization bill. It would stop unsafe  equipment from entering our ports. We  worked hard to put forward language  that provides inspectors the right tools  while at the same time minimizing unnecessary costs and burdens on equipment manufacturers. Again, the modifications are in the bill that we agreed  to with the majority in the Commerce  Committee, but they are not in the bill  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:58 Mar 08, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\S17FE2.REC S17FE2 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2012

154,Senate,112,-0.362,69,2012-02-17,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr.  President,  today I wish to honor the life of Whitney Elizabeth Houston who  passed  away on Saturday, February 11, 2012.  Whitney Houston was a shining star  born in the great city of Newark, NJ,  whose  life will be celebrated  locally  and globally by her family and friends.  Whitney followed in the footsteps of  her mother and began performing as a  soloist in the junior gospel choir at the  New Hope Baptist Church in Newark,  where her first solo performance was  ‘‘Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah.’’  Later she became the first woman of  color to grace the cover of Seventeen  Magazine and was also featured in layouts  in the pages of Glamour, Cosmopolitan, and Young Miss.  In 1983, Clive Davis, head of Arista  Records, helped start Whitney’s recording career, and she went on to begin  her meteoric rise to fame, with Rolling  Stone praising her as ‘‘one of the most  exciting new voices in years,’’ while  the New York Times called her debut,  self-titled album ‘‘an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent.’’  In 1986, a year after the initial release of her debut album, Whitney  topped the Billboard 200 albums chart  and stayed there for 14 weeks with the  final single,  ‘‘Greatest Love of All,’’  which became one of her biggest hits.  The album became the first album by a  female to yield three No. 1 hits.  Whitney Houston is recognized as the  most awarded female musical artist of  all  time, having  received  2 Emmy  Awards, 6 Grammy Awards, 22 American Music Awards, and 30 Billboard  Music Awards. She also holds numerous other distinctions,  including the  best selling single by a female artist in  music history,  first solo act to sell  more than 1,000,000 copies of an album  within a 1-week period, the only artist  to chart 7 consecutive No. 1 Billboard  Hot 100 hits. She also had the best selling movie soundtrack of all time, ‘‘The  Bodyguard.’’  Beyond her professional career, Whitney Houston demonstrated her commitment to humanitarianism as a supporter  of Nelson Mandela  and  the  antiapartheid movement, refusing to  do business with agencies that did business with the then-apartheid South Africa. She also  founded  the Whitney  Houston Foundation for Children, an  organization that cared for the homeless  and  children with  cancer  and  AIDS. And during the 2009 2010 academic  school year,  the Whitney E.  Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts became a thriving, arts-  focused  institution that provides expanded educational opportunities  for  the student body and surrounding community.  There are many reasons why America  will never forget Whitney Houston, but  one of the most memorable was her  performance of  ‘‘The Star Spangled  Banner’’ at Super Bowl XXV on January 27, 1991. That performance was so  powerful that it was later released as a  commercial single and the video of her  performance reached the top 20 on the  Billboard Hot 100, making her the only  person to turn the national anthem  into a pop hit of that magnitude.  Mr. President,  it  is with  immense  sadness but great honor that I recognize, commend, and celebrate the life  and legacy of Whitney E. Houston, a  star of New Jersey who went on to  shine bright across the globe. I extend  my deepest condolences to Whitney’s  mother Cissy Houston, daughter Bobbi  Kristina, her other  family members  and friends, and to her millions of fans.  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.  (The nominations received today are  printed at the end of the Senate proceedings.)  f  ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT  DATED  FEBRUARY  2012  WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF  THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2012—PM 41  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States, together with an accompanying  report; which was referred to the Joint  Economic Committee:  To the Congress of the United States:  One of the fundamental tenets of the  American economy has been that  if  you work hard, you can do well enough  to raise a family, own a home, send  your kids to college, and put a little  money away for retirement. That’s the  promise of America.  The defining issue of our time is how  to keep that promise alive. We can either  settle  for  a  country where  a  shrinking number of people do very  well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore  an economy where everyone gets a fair  shot, everyone does their fair share,  and everyone plays by the same set of  rules.  Long before the recession that began  in December 2007, job growth was insufficient  for  our  growing  population.  Manufacturing jobs were leaving our  shores. Technology made  businesses  more efficient, but also made some jobs  obsolete. The few at the top saw their  incomes  rise  like never before, but  most hardworking Americans struggled  with costs  that were growing, paychecks  that were not, and personal  debt that kept piling up.  In 2008, the house of cards collapsed.  We learned that mortgages had been  sold to people who could not afford  them  or  did not understand  them.  Banks had made huge bets and doled  out big bonuses with other people’s  money. Regulators  had  looked  the  other way, or did not have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was  wrong.  It was  irresponsible. And  it  plunged our economy into a crisis that  put millions out of work, saddled us  with more debt, and  left  innocent,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:58 Mar 08, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\S17FE2.REC S17FE2 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2012
155,,112,-0.112,188,2012-02-17,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. Speaker, as the Co-Chairman of the House Azerbaijan Caucus, I rise  today  to bring attention  to  the  tragedy  that  took place in Khojaly, Azerbaijan, a town and  townspeople that were destroyed on February  26, 1992.  Sadly, today there is little attention or interest paid  to  the plight of Khojaly outside of  Azerbaijan. However,  one  of  our  greatest  strengths as elected officials is the opportunity  to bring to light truths that are little known and  command  recognition. As a  friend of Azerbaijan, I am proud to remind my colleagues  that we must never  forget  the  tragedy  that  took place at Khojaly.  At the time, the Khojaly tragedy was widely  covered by the international media, including  the Boston Globe, Washington Post, New  York Times, Financial Times, and many other  European and Russian news agencies.  Khojaly, a  town  in  the Nagorno-Karabakh  region of Azerbaijan, now under the control of  Armenian forces, was the site of the largest  killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians. With a  population of approximately 7,000, Khojaly  was one of the largest urban settlements of  the Nagorno-Karabakh  region of Azerbaijan  and was destroyed after the attack. Hundreds  were killed or injured.  Twenty years later, the cause of this conflict  has not yet been resolved. As the Presidents  of the United States, Russia and France underlined  in  their statement at  the Deauville  Summit in May 26, 2011, the current status  quo is unacceptable.  Azerbaijan has been a strong strategic partner and friend of the United States. The tragedy of Khojaly was a crime against humanity  and I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with Azerbaijanis as  they commemorate  this tragedy.  FURTHER HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS  IN CASTRO’S CUBA: THE  CONTINUED  ABUSE  OF  POLITICAL PRISONERS  HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 17, 2012  ",2012
156,,112,0.16,188,2012-02-17,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday I chaired a joint hearing of the Subcommittee  on Africa, Global Health,  and  Human Rights and the Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere to focus on just one aspect—though a deeply  troubling one—of  the  overall abysmal human  rights  record of  the  dictatorship in Cuba.  The hearing examined  the ongoing violations of  the human rights of Cuban political  prisoners—from  the arrest, prosecution, and  persecution of political opponents of the Castro regime to the deplorable conditions of their  imprisonment—to the terms under which they  are released.  The announcement of the release of some  prisoners in late December, in conjunction with  the release over the past two years of more  than three dozen political prisoners, has been  described as a public relations move designed  to portray a loosening of Cuba’s political repression of opponents. Those of us who have  had the privilege of knowing and working with  Cuba’s human rights champions for decades,  and have heard first-hand of the brutality of  the Castro government, are not so easily persuaded or deceived.  Cuba has been a totalitarian state with the  Cuban Communist Party as the sole legal political party for more than half a century. Upon  his seizure of power in Cuba in 1959, Fidel  Castro promised a return to constitutional rule  and democratic elections with social reforms.  However, Castro’s control over  the military  and government structures allowed his regime  to crush dissent, marginalize resistance leaders and imprison or execute thousands of opponents. Between 1959 and 1962 alone, it is  estimated  that  the Castro  regime executed  3,200 people. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled an increasingly radical government.  Those who remained in Cuba faced a repressive regime that denied basic human rights.  More than fifty years after Castro’s assumption of power in Cuba, the U.S. Department of  State human rights report on Cuba describes  a government that still denies its citizens the  right  to change  their government;  threatens,  harasses and beats  its opponents  through  state security  forces and government-organized mobs; sentences opponents  to harsh  and  life-threatening prison  conditions; arbitrarily detains human  rights advocates and  members of  independent organizations, and  selectively prosecutes perceived opponents  and then denies them a fair trial.  Cuba’s political prisoners are held, together  with the rest of the prison population, in substandard and unhealthy conditions, where they  face physical and sexual abuse. Most prisoners suffer  from malnutrition and reside  in  overcrowded cells without appropriate medical  attention. In fact, political prisoners face selective denial of medical care. Cuban prisons fail  to segregate those held in pre-trial detention  from long-term violent inmates, and minors are  often mixed in with adults. Such are the conditions opponents of  the Castro  regime have  faced over the years—some of them for decades.  Armando  Valladares,  who  unfortunately  couldn’t join us yesterday, but who will appear  at a future hearing, was a Cuban Postal Bank  employee who was arrested  for  refusing  to  display a sign on his desk that promoted communism. Mr. Valladares was  imprisoned  in  1960 at age 23, and spent 22 years in prison.  Like many  freed  political  prisoners, Mr.  Valladares moved to the United States.  In  1988, President Ronald Reagan  appointed him to serve as the United States Ambassador  to  the United Nations Commission  on Human Rights, a position  in which he  served for two years. I was with Ambassador  Valladares in Geneva when he succeeded in  bringing Cuba  before  the  commission  for  human rights violations and authorizing a U.N.  fact-finding trip to Cuba to investigate prison  conditions.  I  have  read Mr.  Valladares’ memoir—  Against All Hope—a book that chronicles his  experiences and  that of others  in Cuba’s  gulags. Mr.  Valladares  systematically  describes  the  torture,  cruelty, and degrading  treatment by Cuban prison guards. Yet, like so  many other heroic Cuban dissidents, he persisted and overcame.  Our surprise witness yesterday was the brilliant, humanitarian Dr. O´scar Elı´as Biscet. A  medical doctor and courageous human rights  advocate, Dr. Biscet was one of more  than  two dozen dissidents who were arrested and  detained by Cuban police in August 1999 for  organizing meetings in Havana and Matanzas.  He was released after five days but was rearrested three more times. The second time  he was arrested, later in 1999, he spent three  years in prison. His third arrest in December  2002 resulted in a beating, but not imprisonment. Upon his fourth arrest in March 2003,  he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Along  with more than 50 other dissidents, Dr. Biscet  was released in March 2011 with the help of  the Catholic Church. He has courageously remained in Cuba, where he continues to advocate  for human rights. For his extraordinary  bravery and commitment  to  freedom  for  the  Cuban people, many of us have  twice recommended Dr. Biscet  for  the Nobel Peace  Prize.  Other political prisoners have not had  the  ability to choose where they live following their  release. Normando Herna´ndez Gonza´lez, an  independent writer and journalist, was arrested  in March 2003 along with 74 other dissidents  in Camaguey and was sentenced to 25 years  in prison. As a result of his serious abuse in  prison, Mr. Herna´ndez eventually was diagnosed with several diseases of the digestive  system and later tuberculosis. Due to his detecondition, Mr. Herna´ndez  riorating medical  was released  from prison  in July 2010 and  taken  to  the Havana Airport, where he was  briefly reunited with his wife and daughter before being forced to board an overnight flight  to Spain. He later emigrated to Miami, where  he currently resides.  I extend the gratitude of the subcommittee  to our distinguished witnesses  for  joining us  yesterday. My good friend and colleague Dan  Burton, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia, testified about U.S. policy  toward Cuba. In particular, we are deeply appreciative that Dr. Biscet took the serious risk  that he will suffer retaliation for speaking with  us publicly.

MICHAEL M. HONDA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 17, 2012  ",2012
158,,112,-0.529,195,2012-02-17,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker, February 19,  2012 marks  the  seventieth anniversary of  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s signing  of Executive Order (EO) 9066, authorizing the  relocation of 120,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent living in the United  States—my  family  included—to  internment  camps. As  I  look back on  the past seventy  years, I cannot help but reflect on the bravery  and courage of three men whose intertwined  stories shaped my inherent values and life’s  work: Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi,  and my own father, Giichi ‘‘Byron’’ Honda.  At  the outbreak of World War  II, Gordon  was studying at the University of Washington.  Fred tried to enlist in the U.S. National Guard  and U.S. Coast Guard to serve his country but  was turned away because of his Japanese ancestry. My father was pursuing his dream of  becoming a doctor by working as a truck driver in order to pay his way through community  college.  All three men’s lives and dreams were shattered when President Roosevelt signed EO  9066. Once the West Coast was declared as  a military zone, my family and I were hauled  to the Merced Assembly Center and then incarcerated at the Amache internment camp in  southeast Colorado. While my family lived behind barbed wire, my father was recruited into  the U.S. Military  Intelligence Service at  the  University of Colorado Boulder, where he  taught Japanese.  Although  this gross  injustice propelled my  family into years of separation, it would also  unknowingly propel both Fred and Gordon—  two  ordinary men—to  become  preeminent  Asian American and Pacific Islander civil rights  leaders. Believing that the executive order violated  the  freedoms guaranteed by  the Constitution, Fred refused to comply with it, was  subsequently arrested, convicted and sent to  an internment camp in Utah. Gordon was also  arrested, convicted and sent  to an Arizona  prison.  In the face of these challenges, Fred and  Gordon still maintained their core belief in the  American justice system and equality. With the  help of  the American Civil Liberties Union,  both appealed their cases all the way to the  Supreme Court. The Court, however, ruled unfavorably to both, declaring the incarceration a  ‘‘military necessity,’’  justified by  the Army’s  claims.  Although Fred and Gordon’s fights to overturn their convictions took more than four decades, American  justice and equality did ultimately prevail. Fred’s conviction was overturned in 1983, and Gordon’s in 1987. Fred  and Gordon’s resistance paved  the way  for  the eventual passage of the Civil Liberties Act  of 1988, which granted reparations  to Japanese Americans and was a fundamental step  in acknowledging the injustices of the government’s actions.  Mr. Speaker, on  today’s Day of Remembrance, exactly seventy years after the signing  of EO 9066, it is important to remember and  share the lessons of those who bravely stood  their ground against discrimination. Fred and  Gordon’s stories remind us that all individuals  have the potential to do extraordinary deeds in  extraordinary times by simply standing up for  what is right, even if it feels like all forces are  against us. Although life in Amache taught me  that being Japanese in America was bad, my  father reminded me that I should never feel  ashamed of my heritage and  that  I should  continue to work hard in order to be recognized.  It  is  important  to  revisit  the  lessons  that  Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, my father, and other civil rights heroes have taught  us because  their stories are ones  that  transcend race, class and politics. They taught us  that we must  face discrimination and xenophobia with strong resolution or else we are  vulnerable to repeating the egregious mistakes  of the past.  Discrimination  is always  lurking  just below  the surface and often reveals  itself  in  trying  times, but as all three men showed, ordinary  Americans are capable of achieving extraordinary feats for themselves, their families, and  their country.  In  the end,  I  learned  that  the  highest  respect and honor we can bestow  upon those who struggled for a more perfect  union is to continue their legacies, apply their  unwavering principles, and make sure history,  as in the case of EO 9066, does not repeat  itself.

159,House,112,0.492,2,2012-02-27,Mr. PALAZZO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 1433, the Private Property Rights Protection Act of  2012. This bill represents a return of  basic property rights to the American  people, rights we are guaranteed in the  U.S. Constitution. In 2005, these rights  came under attack when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a corporation taking  individual homes  in  the name of economic development. As  a result, people  lost their homes to  false promises of jobs and tax revenue.  Now, instead of a booming business,  there is only a city dump where the  homes once stood.  I agree with Supreme Court Justice  Clarence Thomas when he wrote in his  dissenting opinion:  Something has gone seriously awry with  this Court’s interpretation of the Constitution. Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not safe.  That is also why I supported an eminent domain amendment to the Mississippi Constitution, Mississippi Initiative 31, which 73 percent of Mississippi voters approved last November.  I urge my colleagues to support property rights to the Constitution in H.R.  1433.  f  NATIONAL  INSTITUTES  OF  HEALTH OBSERVES RARE DISEASE DAY  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

160,House,112,0.57,2,2012-02-27,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  week is Rare Disease Day, which will  take place on February 29. I want to  acknowledge the work of the National  Institutes of Health in their efforts to  bring down rare diseases. I also want to  acknowledge the thousands of Americans who are afflicted with diseases  whose systems are so complex that  they simply remain undiagnosed. The  majority of these disorders have genetic causes, and over half affect children.  The National Institutes of Health has  joined a worldwide effort with more  than 40 countries to recognize and seek  better ways to diagnose and treat patients. On February 29, the NIH is observing the fifth annual Rare Disease  Day and hosting a daylong program of  activities highlighting the rare disease  research community.  In conjunction with that, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins will announce  the launch of the Genetic Testing Registry. This is an online tool developed  by NIH scientists providing health care  providers and patients access to information on genetic tests. I also have  legislation that would expand on these  efforts.  This Wednesday, February  29,  the  rarest of days on the calendar, we will  pause to honor those who are working  hard to research, diagnose, treat, and  empower patients with the rarest of  rare diseases. I want to acknowledge  the work of the NIH. I’m grateful that  they’re organizing an event like Rare  Disease Day.  f  TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT  (Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2012
161,House,112,0.345,9,2012-02-27,Mr. WOMACK.," Let me take it a step  further because I can relate to what  the gentleman is talking about and can  relate it back to my home district.  I think the gentleman would agree  that, over the last several years in Arkansas, there has been a phenomenal  rate of growth in the northwest part of  our State, the area that I happen to  represent, which is the great Third District of Arkansas. It’s known for its incredible growth over the last several  years. Now, it is home to some pretty  well-known companies, companies like  Wal-Mart and J.B. Hunt trucking and  Tyson Foods.  If you look at northwest Arkansas,  there is really no compelling reason  why prior to the establishment of those  major companies that northwest Arkansas would be an area where you  would have this unprecedented growth.  But for the entrepreneurial spirit and  drive of guys like Sam Walton and Don  Tyson and J.B. Hunt—and I could go  down another list of people who have  provided jobs and who have created and  expanded  businesses  and who  have  made  a meaningful  impact  on  the  greater mid-South and the entire Nation—northwest Arkansas would  be  kind of an average area with no great  infrastructure, until  recently  there,  and with no real compelling reason  why it would be anything special.  Yet we’re fighting an issue in the  greater northwest Arkansas area that  could,  indeed,  impact our ability to  continue to grow. I’m talking about  EPA’s desire,  insatiable appetite, to  put a total maximum daily  load, a  TMDL,  if you would, on phosphorus  loading in the Illinois River watershed,  which flows into Oklahoma, because of  a loading standard imposed on northwest Arkansas  by  our  neighboring  State, a standard that many say is not  even achievable.  So all of the great development and  job creation and the elevated quality of  life  is  in  jeopardy. The  future  is  in  jeopardy as a result of a Federal agency imposing on the region a standard  that may or may not even be able to be  achieved.  I bring that up for this reason: back  when I was a mayor of a city in northwest Arkansas, I challenged EPA to  give us the science, to show us exactly  how they can calculate that this standard has been impacted by the farmers  and ranchers of northwest Arkansas  and  those who manage  the  point  sources of pollution, the municipalities. I happened to be the mayor who  presided over one of those. As I understand it, the science was a collection of  data from about 20 streams somewhere  in America, streams not known to us.  They took, I think, the 75th percentile  of the average phosphorus loading into  those streams. I doubt seriously that  they used streams and rivers that were  similar to what we were dealing with  in northwest Arkansas.  I bring up this subject only because  we’re talking about  job creation tonight, and our ability to continue to  expand the economy in northwest Arkansas is dependent on our ability to  have a good, clean water supply and to  be able to treat our wastewater and to  be able to discharge it properly and  sufficiently in order to be able to create growth.  Yet I’m afraid, one day, we’re going  to look up, and because of these standards imposed on us by the Federal bureaucracy,  this  overregulation  that  we’ve  talked about,  that we’re not  going to have an opportunity to grow  because we’re going to be into moratoria on growth and development  in  our area as a result of these unfair  standards. But that’s a whole other  story.  I really came tonight to talk with  my colleague about  tax  reform because, as we’ve indicated, the threat of  higher taxes, or the tax structure as we  now know it, is, in my strongest opinion, one of the great barriers to job creation.

214,Senate,112,0.403,30,2012-02-27,Mr. ISAKSON.," I thank Senator ALEXANDER for giving me a moment on the  floor.  It is ironic that when I received the  call last week asking if I would participate in this colloquy, I was traveling  my State doing townhall meetings. I  was near Ooltewah, TN, on Thursday  night, north of Dalton, GA, and Murray  County. We had a townhall meeting,  and this fellow in the back of the room  raised his hand when it came time for  questions.  He said: Mr. ISAKSON, I have got a  question for you. I said: What is that?  He said: Last night, my wife and I  amended our budget that we established in December for this year because some things have not gone so  well, and we had to recast how we are  spending our money so we wouldn’t go  any further in debt than we already  are. Why can’t you all do the same  thing? ‘‘You all,’’ talking about us.  A few days earlier in Dublin, GA, a  great, prosperous town in south Georgia, a similar question was asked by a  Chamber of Commerce director who  couldn’t understand why the Federal  Government and the Congress of the  United States could not wrap  their  arms around fiscal responsibility, have  a budget, and have appropriations acts  that come to the floor, are debated, are  amended,  and  the  spending  of  the  United States of America’s government  is spent  like the households of the  United States of America have to spend  their money.  So I commend Senator ALEXANDER  and Senator PRYORfor bringing this to  the floor, and I want to commend our  leaders for making affirmative statements about the desire to bring the 12  appropriations bills to the floor of the  Senate, debate  them,  let us amend  them, and let us bring them together.  If you think about it, in the last 3  years we have had a situation where we  either had continuing resolutions or  omnibus appropriations. During a difficult period of time where we have had  deficits of $1.3 trillion to $1.5 trillion,  we haven’t taken the time to debate  how we are spending our money, where  we are spending our money, and doing  it in the context of what we call on the  floor regular order. In fact, it is not  hard to understand why only 11 percent  of the American people view the Congress as favorable, because they can’t  understand our  inability to do what  they have to do themselves. The IRS  doesn’t take excuses on April 15 if you  are not ready. You have got to be  ready. If you are a business and you  file as an LLC or a sub S corporation,  on the 15th of January, the 15th of  April, the 15th of June, and the 15th of  September, you file a quarterly tax return; and if you don’t, you are held accountable.  We are now going  into our  fourth  year, and it looks as though for the  first time in the last 3 years we are  going to have debate on the floor of  how we spend the American people’s  money. I commend Senator ALEXANDER  and Senator PRYOR, and I thank our  leadership for making the statement of  the desire to do so. I have already seen  Senator INOUYEand I have already seen  Senator COCHRANworking diligently in  the basic appropriations  subcommittees to see to it that those bills come  to the floor. I think it is time we do  our business just as the American people do their business, and I commend  Senator  and  Senator  PRYOR for calling for this colloquy tonight.  ",2012

Each year, the National Rural Water Association sponsors  the Great American Water  Taste Test to honor small community drinking  water supplies from across the United States  who provide the public with safe, clean, and  affordable water. The goal of the competition  is to judge great tasting water that comes directly from the tap.  Prior to the national contest, water providers  participate  in state events. The Mt. View–  Edgewood Water Company competed against  19 other water samples from all over the State  of Washington to be named the Washington  State winner at the Evergreen Rural Water of  Washington Fall Conference and Tradeshow.  The company was honored  for  the water’s  clarity, bouquet, and taste.  The Mt.

222,,112,-0.263,58,2012-02-27,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the distinguished service of Colonel David E.  Chesser, whose  tenure as Garrison Commander at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, concludes  February 29, 2012. Colonel Chesser assumed  his duties as Garrison Commander on April 3,  2008.  Colonel Chesser’s 30 years of dedicated  service  in  the U.S. Army  is noteworthy  in  every respect. He is a graduate of the Infantry  Officer Basic Course, U.S. Army Airborne  School, Engineer Officer Advanced Course,  Combined Arms and Services Staff School,  Command and General Staff Officer Course,  the Army Management Staff College Sustaining  Base  Leadership  & Management  Course, and the Army War College.  Colonel Chesser has committed his life to  serving our country and has received many  deserving awards and decorations,  including  the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal  with seven Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters,  Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Order of the de Fleury Medal,  the Presidents Hundred Tab, the Distinguished  Rifleman Badge,  the Combat Action Badge,  and the Meritorious Unit Citation, as well as  various campaign and service medals.  Under Colonel Chesser’s outstanding leadership, Fort McCoy became one of the most  capable and desirable Reserve Component  training  installations  in  the Army, providing  stellar  base  operations  support  to  over  120,000 Soldiers annually. During his tenure,  Colonel Chesser launched and led one of the  most dramatic community  transformations  in  the installation’s history, propelling Fort McCoy  to win the FY09 Army Communities of Excellence competition and again in FY10; a direct  reflection of his leadership, strategic planning  and thinking. He took an installation that had  one of the most difficult records for food service and within one year improved it through  sound management and leadership technique  which  led  to  the Garrison’s Connelly Food  Service Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Fort  McCoy was also  recognized as one of  the  Army’s best in maintenance of military equipment, having won  the Army Maintenance of  Excellence Award in 2009 and achieving first  runner-up  in 2010. Colonel Chesser  transformed an underperforming mobilization training center into one recognized as one of the  Army’s best and most effective of the seven  active Army Power Projection Platforms.  It has been an honor  for me  to serve as  U.S. Representative  for Wisconsin’s  Third  Congressional  District  during  Colonel  Chesser’s tenure at Fort McCoy. I know Colonel  Chesser’s  leadership  will  be  greatly  missed at the base and surrounding communities, but I am thankful for his leadership and  contributions to ensuring that Fort McCoy remains a shining star  in  the nation’s military  training infrastructure.  On behalf of my constituents in Wisconsin  and a grateful nation, I would like to thank and  commend Colonel David Chesser for his years  of dedicated service in the U.S. Army and in  particular as Garrison Commander at Fort  McCoy.  f  RECOGNIZING ROBERT FOY  HON.

I  would like to especially recognize Commander  Spohn for his leadership at NSA Crane, the  world’s third largest Naval Installation, based  in Indiana’s 8th Congressional District.  Commander Spohn began his 35 year career by enlisting in the Navy as a Boiler Technician in January 1977 and received his commission in June 1990 through the Limited Duty  Officer Program.  His many achievements in academics and  the Navy have made him an officer  that all  sailors and citizens should emulate. His dedication to our nation has spanned many decades and many posts and for that I would like  to thank Commander Spohn.  f  HONORING  THE  ESTABLISHMENT  OF THE USO CENTER AT THE  TAMPA  INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT  HON.

This has been a long process, but thanks to  a hardworking team of volunteers, the USO in  Tampa  is excited about serving  the roughly  40,000 active military and their families living  in the Tampa Bay area that may use Tampa  International Airport as well as  the approximately 300,000  that  fly  in and out of  the  Tampa International Airport on a yearly basis.  As both a Congressman and a  father of  three sons in the U.S. Army, I know how important the USO services are to our men and  women in uniform. When I visit with the veterans  in my district,  I hear  their stories of  watching Bob Hope in the USO Concerts and  receiving packages with urgent supplies from  the USO on Christmas. Today’s USO centers  give our active duty heroes a place to relax,  if only for a few minutes.  The new facility in the Tampa International  Airport will allow members of our local communities the opportunity to recognize the service and sacrifice of this Nation’s proud active  duty servicemembers and their families.  I am a proud supporter of this outstanding  institution  and welcome  its  arrival  in  the  Tampa International Airport.  AZERBAIJAN  HON.

226,,112,0.641,65,2012-02-27,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, since declaring its  independence  from  the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has been a valuable ally to the United  States in a turbulent region. In the true spirit  of  friendship,  it seems appropriate  for Congress to note the 20th anniversaries of two important events in their country’s history which  take place in late-February.  February 26 marked the 20th anniversary of  the Khojaly Tragedy which is the largest of Azerbaijani civilians in the country’s history.  The  town  of Khojaly  is  located  in  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  region of Azerbaijan and  was then home to some 7,000 Azerbaijani citizens. On February 25–26, 1992, in a period of  less than 12 hours, 613 citizens were slain at  the hands of Armenian forces.  In  the wake of  these atrocities, Human  Rights Watch described the advancing forces  as committing  ‘‘unconscionable acts of violence against civilians as they fled.’’ Given our  deepening ties with Azerbaijan it is important  for American citizens to remember this event.  February 28 is the 20th anniversary of the  establishment of Azerbaijani-American diplomatic relations, which is an event forming a  partnership which of importance to both countries.  The initial focus of these relations was on  trade between the two countries and, in particular,  Azerbaijan’s  abundant  natural  resources. Today, Azerbaijan is a full partner to  the United States, working with us and our allies to safeguard our combined security and  prosperity.  One of  the most  telling examples of  their  commitment  to  this partnership came  in  the  wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, when Azerbaijan pledged  to stand by  the United States as in our efforts to secure  the homeland and bring  justice  to  the perpetrators of this tragedy.  True to its word, Azerbaijan has supported  allied efforts in the War on Terror by allowing  unrestricted access to its territory for American  aircraft, troops and supplies, as well as committing  its own  troops  to  fight alongside our  own.  As these two important anniversaries come  to pass, I join Azerbaijan in mourning those  who died in Khojaly, celebrating 20 years of  shared diplomatic relations, and hoping for the  continued security and prosperity of our nations in an ever-more dangerous world.  f  HONORING DWIGHT AND SHARON  POAGE AND THE MAYAN FAMILIES  HON.

227,,112,0.298,65,2012-02-27,Mr. STIVERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and  thank Dwight and Sharon Poage  and the Mayan Families for their extraordinary  passion for causes that have made enduring  positive differences  in people’s  lives  in  the  Lake Atitlan region of Guatemala.  This record recognizes the Mayan Families’  strong partnership with  the Upper Arlington  Rotary Club in jointly creating sustainable humanitarian  focused projects  that provide opportunities, hope and a future for the indigenous and impoverished people in Guatemala.  Your commitment to potable water, children  and adult nutrition, education and  improving  basic essential living conditions in the underserved communities has had a profound impact. On behalf of the citizens of Ohio’s 15th  Congressional District I commend your dedicated efforts for the families of Guatemala.  f  HONORING THE LIVES OF CAPTAIN  RYAN P. HALL OF  COLORADO  SPRINGS,  COLORADO;  CAPTAIN  NICHOLAS  S.  WHITLOCK  OF  NEWNAN, GEORGIA; FIRST LIEUTENANT JUSTIN J. WILKENS, OF  BEND,  OREGON;  AND  SENIOR  AIRMAN  JULIAN  S.

228,,112,0.633,65,2012-02-27,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  with deep sympathy and solemn gratitude that  I rise to pay tribute to four of our nation’s fallen heroes: Captain Ryan P. Hall of Colorado  Springs,  Colorado;  Captain  Nicholas  S.  Whitlock of Newnan, Georgia; First Lieutenant  Justin J. Wilkens, of Bend, Oregon; and Senior Airman Julian S. Scholten of Upper Marlboro, Maryland.  These four brave, young men paid the ultimate price in defense of our nation’s freedom  when  their U–28 aircraft went down near  Djibouti, Africa on Saturday, February 18,  2012. They were members of  the United  States Air Force Special Operations Command. Of their dedication to duty, courage of  heart, and commitment to their nation, there  can be no doubt. They were living examples  of the Airman’s Creed, ‘‘I am an American Airman, guardian of freedom and justice, my nation’s sword and shield, its sentry and avenger. I defend my Country with my life.’’ Upon  the altar of freedom, they have fulfilled their  vow to defend their country and paid the ultimate price.  The report of this tragic incident pierced the  hearts  of  their  families,  friends,  and  the  AFSOC community. It reminds us that there is  no greater sacrifice  than  that  in which one  gives his life for others.  While there are no words that we can say  here on  the  floor  today  that will bring back  Ryan, Nicholas, Justin, and Julian  to  those  who love them and know them best, we can  and will honor their service and sacrifice. We  have heard many  times and know  in our  hearts the truth that Freedom often demands  of us a heavy and at times unbearable price.  It is a burden of loss that rests heavily upon  those who love them.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful United  States Congress, I stand here today to honor  these four men and all of the heroes we have  lost. My wife, Vicki  joins me  in offering our  deepest, most sincere condolences and prayers to their families and friends. May God continue to bless them, the AFSOC community,  and the United States Armed Forces.

247,House,112,0.593,6,2012-03-20,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, as  the bagpipes played in the background,  the black cloth of sacrifice was draped  over the badges of Houston first responders yesterday.  Senior  Captain  Thomas  ‘‘Bill’’  Dillion of the Houston Fire Department was rushing into a house fire on  March 14 when he apparently died of a  heart attack. Captain Dillion was 49  years of age and had spent 23 years  with the Houston Fire Department. He  had three children.  With  somber  respect, hundreds of  Texas  firefighters,  police  officers,  emergency medical  technicians, and  citizens  attended  his  funeral. Mr.  Speaker,  300  firefighters  from other  towns in Texas volunteered their time  to fill in at Houston Fire Department  stations so Houston firefighters could  attend the funeral.  Firefighters are a  family of dedicated,  loyal public servants. Captain  Dillion and other  firefighters  spend  their lives rescuing people they do not  know and protecting property  they  have never seen from fire. Most of us  flee danger;  firefighters rush to the  smell of smoke and the heat of danger.  Bill’s crew at Station 69 spoke yesterday about him, saying he was a devout Christian, had a contagious happy  mood,  loved to  fish and, of course,  liked country music.  Captain Dillion and his fellow firefighters are a remarkable breed, a rare  breed, the American breed. We thank  them, one and all.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  AMERICAN WOMEN’S HEALTH  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2012
248,House,112,0.647,13,2012-03-20,Mr. CHAFFETZ.," Mr. Speaker, I have  no additional speakers. I just want to  simply thank the gentleman from Illinois. He’s truly one who will stand on  principle and work on both sides of the  aisle, and for that we’re very grateful  and appreciative. This is what we are  supposed to be doing, working in a bipartisan way.  H.R. 665, as amended, is a good bill.  It’s good government, it’s something  we should do, and I would urge all of  my colleagues to support it. I appreciate all the support from our leadership in making this point happen.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.  ",2012
249,House,112,0.554,13,2012-03-20,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 665, the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act of  2011. This important bipartisan legislation will  decrease the deficit by selling excess federal  buildings and property by empowering the executive branch to more quickly dispose of excess federal property. This bill would also permanently modernize  the  existing  disposal  process  through  reductions  in administrative  overhead. This bill also requires greater accountability from those responsible for federal  property disposal.  The federal government owns a staggering  one-third of the United States and owns more  real property than any other entity in America:  900,000 buildings and structures covering 3.38  billion square  feet. According  to a February  10, 2011 Government Accountability Office  (GAO) report, 24  federal agencies  identified  45,190 underutilized buildings that cost $1.66  billion annually to operate. More recently, Office of Management and Budget Comptroller  Daniel Werfel testified before a Senate Subcommittee that the government controls even  more, with 14,000 excess buildings and structures and 76,000 underutilized properties. This  large  inventory of underutilized  federal property is the product of a convoluted and inefficient disposal process.  H.R. 665 works  to correct  this by establishing a five-year pilot program, beginning on  the date that the legislation is enacted, to dispose of excess federal property. The Director  of the Office of Management and Budget and  the Administrator of the General Services Administration  (GSA) would  identify, with  input  from  federal agencies,  the 15 excess properties with  the highest market value. These  properties will be disposed of through public  auction, and after one property  is sold,  the  GSA will have 15 days  to  identify another  property to replace the auctioned property on  the  list  for disposal. Ninety-eight percent of  profits will be deposited into the Treasury and  2 percent will be directed toward the Department of Housing and Urban Development to  provide grants for homeless assistance.  Selling off unused  federal property would  allow the federal government to focus our limited fiscal resources on maintaining the property the United States currently owns. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Excess  Federal Building and Property Disposal Act to  begin prioritizing the public auction of unused  federal property and reducing the nation ’s $15  trillion national debt.

251,House,112,0.416,20,2012-03-20,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 5  minutes to the author of this legislation, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  RIGELL).  ",2012
252,House,112,0.405,20,2012-03-20,Mr. RIGELL.," I thank my friend, the  gentleman from Washington.  I appreciate  the opportunity, Mr.  Chairman, to come before this body  today and make the case that this is  wonderful and strong legislation that  should be moved forward for one purpose:  job  creation  in  the Commonwealth of Virginia and, specifically, in  Accomack County.  It, indeed, is a jobs bill. It reflects  common  sense.  It  reflects  common  ground. It came out of committee with  bipartisan support. And I think most  importantly, Mr. Chairman, it reflects  the collective wisdom and the will of  the  hardworking  taxpayers  of  Accomack County.  Here is why, Mr. Chairman, this bill,  if passed and enacted, will create jobs:  You see, the folks of Accomack County  have not asked the Federal Government  for something. They’ve simply  asked the Federal Government to get  out of the way so that the greatest job-  producing engine the world has ever  known,  the American entrepreneurs,  and Accomack County can get to work  in a very responsible way of developing  this property that is immediately adjacent  to  the Wallops NASA  facility  there.  It is, I think, a clear contrast of two  basic philosophical approaches to job  creation. One looks to this institution  and to Washington to see that this institution is the primary driver of job  creation. As a lifetime entrepreneur,  Mr. Chairman, I reject that approach  and, instead, have adopted all of my  life and believe we need to bring to this  body the mindset that the best thing to  do to get our economy going again is to  eliminate the hurdles. This is a very  practical hurdle that is holding back  job creation  in a county  that desperately needs jobs.  Mr. Chairman, 16 percent of the hardworking families in Accomack County  live under the poverty line. About 90  percent  of  the  property  that’s  in  Accomack County is agricultural.  b1540  It is without a doubt a poor county,  and this bill simply removes a deed restriction. My friend behind me just a  few moments ago said, Do you have a  picture of this? I said, Well, we didn’t  bring it down to the floor, but we could  have. It’s just overgrown. There’s nothing there. There’s a dilapidated dugout  facility, and that’s it. There’s no parking, there’s no infrastructure, there’s  no buildings.  Accomack County has a plan. Americans are  resourceful. They’ll  figure  their way out of this in spite of Washington. The board of supervisors has a  wonderful plan  for  the Wallops Research Park; but it only works, Mr.  Chairman, if this deed restriction is removed. Thirty-two acres. Great potential for the folks in Accomack County.  I want to close, Mr. Chairman, by recounting a conversation that I had just  a few moments ago. I actually called  the person back. I wanted to make sure  I had her permission  to  share  this  story. I trust she’s listening now.

254,Senate,112,0.782,41,2012-03-20,Mr. COBURN.," The IPAB stands for  the  Independent Payment Advisory  Board. They are a group of individuals  who will decide what we pay for and  what we do not pay for in terms of  health care. They will also decide how  much we pay.  Once those 15 people are in place, if  they are wrong, people will have no  ability to challenge it in court. They  have no ability to see their work product and why they decided on what they  did. They have no ability to cut off  their funding. In other words, they are  an autonomous nondemocratic  function whose whole goal will be to control costs.  Well, there are lots of ways to control cost. I call it the ‘‘sovietization’’  of  the American medical  industry.  They are going to control costs. Well,  we know how that works. We have already seen it. It is called NICE in England, and we are seeing a revolt. As a  matter of fact, in England today they  are  talking  about  reforming  their  health care system and going in the opposite direction of what we are doing  because what they know is the rationing of care based on a value of 1 year of  life per  individual  is  the way  they  make that decision.  So if Senator JOHANNSis 78 years old  and has a broken hip and bad diabetes  and bad heart disease, they look at the  value of what his  life expectancy  is  with that and then the cost of fixing  his hip. They say: You are not worth it.  So in England they do not fix your hip.  Well, that is called rationing.  The fact is it is not bad by the word;  it is a loss of liberty. It means people  no longer have the ability to decide  themselves what will happen to them,  and somebody autonomously, very distant from them, makes the decision for  them.  IPAB is not the worst—the innovation council. What will not happen that  the innovation will not allow to happen? I have a story of a patient—and I  will just give an example. Not IPAB,  not innovation, but we are also going  to have the Preventive Services Task  Force  that  is  going  to make  recommendations on screening.  I want to give an example. This is a  true story. I will not use her name, but  a young lady came to me with a breast  lump. I did the standard protocol, best  practices on her. It showed to be a simple cyst, and the point I am making is  about  the art of medicine, not  the  science of medicine because everybody  gets hung up on the science, but nobody ever talks about the art.  I had an uncomfortable feeling about  this cyst. So I aspirated it. It was inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. In  other words, had I followed the protocols that are going to be recommended  by IPAB and the best practices, I would  have never aspirated it.  Well, this patient is now dead. But  she lived 12 years. A delay in diagnosis  on  inflammatory  carcinoma  would  have given her less than a year to live.  Because  I did not  follow what  the  standard protocol was but followed my  history and my knowledge of the patient and my feeling, I diagnosed her  early. She got to see her kids get married; she got to see a grandchild. That  never would have happened.  So what is coming with IPAB and the  Preventive Services Task Force is people making decisions that are not in  the room with the doctor and the patient, and that is the biggest danger of  the Affordable Care Act: that we are  going to take the ability of patients  and doctors to make choices and give  that choice to a government bureaucrat.

256,Senate,112,-0.395,55,2012-03-20,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, over the  last several days there has been an immense outpouring of concern about the  so-called JOBS bill the House has sent  to us, and this outpouring should weigh  upon us. It should make us question  the speed and the lack of deliberation  with which we are considering  this  House bill and question the wisdom of  just sending it back to the House if  there is one amendment to it, which is  on the Ex-Im Bank, and hoping that  somehow  or  another  investors  are  going to be protected in a conference  instead of by the Senate. What we are  considering should be done with great  deliberation, and we should take the  time to get this right.  The House majority leader suggested  yesterday that those of us who are concerned about the House bill are ‘‘creating  phantom  investor  protection  issues.’’ We did not create these issues.  People who know far more about capital markets than the House majority  leader or myself or probably any of us  have asked us to reconsider what we  are poised to do.  Start with the Council of  Institutional Investors. This group’s members  invest a combined $3 trillion in our Nation’s capital markets. They  include  the Nation’s largest pension funds, university endowments, and foundations.  The Council of Institutional Investors,  an  outside,  independent,  objective  group whose sole purpose in life is to  make sure investors are given sound  opportunities and are not defrauded, is  warning us that rather than boosting  investment in our economy, we could  frighten investors out of the market.  They are asking us, they are pleading  with us to reevaluate, and we should.  Next, take a look at the letter from  the  current  SEC  Chairman Mary  Schapiro to the Banking Committee  last week. Chairman Schapiro issues a  lengthy list of warnings about provisions in the House bill. She sums up  her warnings this way: ‘‘If the balances  tip to the point where investors are not  confident that there are appropriate  protections,  investors will  lose confidence in our markets and capital formation will ultimately be made more  difficult and expensive.’’  That is precisely the opposite of the  impact we should want.  We should listen to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which warns us that the House  bill ‘‘would create marketplace and investor confusion’’ that dampens rather  than strengthens investment in growing companies.  We should listen to the association  that represents State securities administrators. What does that association  do? They warn us that ‘‘Congress is on  the verge of enacting policies that although  intended  to  strengthen  the  economy, will  in  fact only make  it  more difficult for small businesses to  access investment capital.’’  We should  listen to the editors of  Bloomberg News,  one  of  the most  trusted sources of commentary on the  markets, who tell us that provisions of  the House bill ‘‘would be dangerous for  investors and could harm already fragile financial markets.’’  Can any of us who have lived through  the fearful days of the financial crisis,  days when we wondered if the entire  economy would crumble—can any of us  or  should any of us vote  to  rush  through  this  body  legislation  that  threatens harm  to  fragile  financial  markets? Do we want to live through  that again?  We should amend this flawed House  bill so we can create opportunity for  American workers, companies and investors  and  not  opportunities  for  fraudsters, boiler room hucksters, and  con artists. We can do that, and we  should do that. One way to do that is  to invoke cloture on the alternative  that Senators JACKREED, MARYLANDRIEUand I have offered and to begin  debate and amendments on that alternative  so  the Senate’s  deliberative  process can begin.  If that cloture vote fails, the only remaining prudent alternative is to reject the cloture motion on the underlying bill so the Senate can begin to  deliberate and consider amendments to  a bill that has aroused such concern  among so many experts whose very job  it is to protect consumers.  Some may  fear that by slowing a  runaway train, they risk being portrayed as hostile to job creation or to  small businesses. After all, how can we  oppose  legislation  titled  the  ‘‘JOBS  Act’’? It takes more than a clever acronym to create jobs. As the astonishing  amount of concern among market experts tells us, this JOBS Act—this so-  called JOBS Act is not a jobs act but  an invitation to the kind of fraud that  destroys jobs.  The Senate is the place where care  and deliberation  is supposed to rule  and is supposed to rein in the excesses  of haste and incaution, and I urge my  colleagues to undertake that responsibility today.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2012
257,Senate,112,0.382,69,2012-03-20,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I join the  Senator from California, Senator FEINin  introducing  legislation  to  clarify the  legal protections  for art  that is loaned from overseas for exhibition in the United States. This bill  passed the House yesterday by voice  vote and I hope it can soon become law.  We are blessed  in this country to  have so many  fine  institutions that  provide exposure to the art, culture,  and history of other lands. Both public  and private art museums can be found  all over America, including at many of  our fine universities. We must ensure  that the exhibitions hosted by these  museums continue to benefit all Americans.  A major exhibition can take years to  develop and potential overseas lenders  must be assured that their art will be  legally protected while  it  is  in the  United States. Many exhibitions simply will not be possible without that  assurance. We have had laws in place  for decades that did just that, and they  worked exactly the way they were supposed to. Specifically, the Protection  from Seizure Act guaranteed that once  the State Department  reviewed and  certified an exhibition as being in the  national interest, the art was immune  from legal judgments or court orders  while in this country.  This  legal  protection was  thrown  into doubt by a Federal court decision  several years ago. The U.S. District  Court here in the Washington considered a case involving the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which allows  certain kinds of lawsuits against foreign countries in American courts. One  of those categories is when art allegedly taken in violation of international  law is present in this country in connection with a commercial activity.  The court construed that condition of  being present  ‘‘in connection with a  commercial activity’’  in a way that  could include art that is here for exhibition under the Protection from Seizure Act.

RECOGNIZING  MRS.  MIRIAM  V.  HENSON ON THE OCCASION OF  HER 105TH BIRTHDAY  HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 20, 2012  ",2012
259,,112,-0.41,97,2012-03-20,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge and honor a beloved leader in  the Co-op City community, Mrs. Miriam V.  Henson, on her 105th birthday.  Mrs. Henson, affectionately called Mother  Henson by her neighbors, is an inspiration to  me and to many of my constituents, so I’d like  to take this opportunity to discuss her life and  achievements.  Mrs. Henson was born in Bangbridge, GA in  1907, but her family shortly thereafter moved  to Harlem, NY, where she graduated  from  Wadleigh High School.  She had one daughter, Virginia Henson,  with her late husband, Mr. Wallace Henson.  After her husband’s passing  in 1969, Mrs.  Henson moved  into Co-op City with Virginia  and began working  for Macy’s Department  store.  Mrs. Henson might now live alone, but she  is never truly alone —since she is such an active member of her community.  From a young age, she has been involved  with philanthropic efforts such as the Young  Women’s Christian Association, YWCA, and  the moment she moved into Co-op City, she  began to reach out to help her neighbors.  She is one of the founding members of the  Community  Protestant  Church,  and  also  served as a Board Trustee, President, and  founding member of the Community Protestant  Church’s Willing Workers Organization.  The ambitious Mother Henson  is also a  founder of  the Dreiser Loop Retirees and a  member of the local AARP Chapter, serving  each organization with love, compassion, and  understanding. And to continue serving others,  she represents  the needs of seniors  in our  state capital in Albany.  A woman of many hobbies, Mrs. Henson is  a real globe-trotter. She has visited countries  throughout the world including Canada, Aruba,  Switzerland, Australia, France, Germany and  Brazil, just to name a few.  She especially loves cruises, and has been  on many  in her  lifetime. Mrs. Henson  recharges  her  batteries  at  home with  card  games, and bridge is among her favorites.  Throughout her 105 years, Mother Henson  has  survived  the  stock market  crash,  the  Great Depression, two World Wars, and the  World Trade Center attacks on September 11,  2001. Despite these tragic events, she still has  a positive outlook on the world.  Mr. Speaker, I think we can all learn a lesson from her.  There ’s no doubt  that Mrs. Henson has  seen and done a lot in her lifetime, but she  says the greatest thing she’s done was having  the opportunity  to vote  for our 44th President—something she did not think would ever  happen in her lifetime. Not only did she experience  it, but now she  is  looking  forward  to  voting in the next presidential election.  Mrs. Henson, as one may imagine, is no ordinary woman. Her philosophy  in  life  is  to  keep the ‘ ‘pep in her step ’ ’ with ‘ ‘good living,  good friends, trusting in God, and a little tonic  twice a day.’ ’ And clearly, it’s working.

260,House,112,0.737,2,2012-03-29,Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, when President Obama was  inaugurated in January 2009, the average nationwide price for a gallon of  gasoline was $1.84. The 2012 March nationwide average has been  $3.89 or  higher,  reflecting a  110 percent  increase. Keep in mind that every penny  increase in the price of gasoline costs  the U.S. economy $1 billion and American consumers $4 million per day.  Now, last week, Secretary of Energy  Steven Chu, while testifying in front of  a House committee, was asked to grade  his performance on American gasoline  prices. He graded himself an ‘‘A’’—an  ‘‘A,’’ America—when the price at the  pump for American families has gone  up over 110 percent.  I’m sorry, Secretary Chu, America  doesn’t grade on a curve. We give your  performance and the performance of  the administration’s handling of energy in America the grade of ‘‘F.’’  f  FISCAL YEAR 2013 BUDGET  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2012
261,House,112,-0.187,2,2012-03-29,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, we all have  our own ideas on how we should balance the budget, but missing in today’s  debate is a bipartisan approach to solve  our Nation’s fiscal problems. No one  party has the answers. We can do this  not through a Republican- nor a Democratic-proposed budget, unless we are  willing to demonstrate bipartisanship.  That’s why I’m opposing both the Republican and the Democratic proposals.  These are not an answer to our Nation’s  fiscal  problems.  Instead,  the  Simpson-Bowles approach reflected in  the Cooper-LaTourette  substitute  is  the preferred approach that we need to  follow.  Last night’s votes and today’s votes  will once again demonstrate that the  Congress is tone deaf. It’s time to put  our economy back on a path to fiscal  sustainability and pass the Simpson-  Bowles measure that last night fell far  short. I suggest we cut $4 trillion from  the deficit over 10 years with spending  cuts and tax reform to ensure solvency  of entitlements such as Medicare and  Social Security. It’s time that we act  in a bipartisan fashion.  f  OBAMACARE DESERVES AN ‘‘F’’  GRADE  (Mrs. HARTZLER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)

265,House,112,0.375,16,2012-03-29,Mr. SHUSTER.," I wish the gentleman  from California would have shown that  kind of passion when the stimulus bill  was passed 2 years ago and had come to  the floor and said that the stimulus  bill should be an infrastructure bill.  There was only a very, very small portion—I think about $68 billion of that  $800  billion  stimulus  package—that  went to the infrastructure of this country. Where was the gentleman when  that outrage was happening?  If you want real stimulation—and we  believe this stimulates the economy in  that this helps put concrete on our  roads and repairs our bridges and puts  people to work—this bill will do that, a  5-year bill. An 18-month bill  is not  going to put any kind of certainty out  there. I correct myself. It will create  certainty. The certainty is that it will  bankrupt the trust fund in less than 2  years. Our bill that we’ve been trying  to pass here, a 5-year bill, that’s what  the people back in the States want.  To the gentleman from Oregon, I’m  surprised. He has been a  long-time  member of the T&I Committee and  knows that a long-term transportation  bill is better for the States, that it’s  better for the folks who build roads and  employ people, and that that’s what we  need here. That’s what we’re trying to  get at.  ",2012

267,House,112,-0.338,16,2012-03-29,Mr. BISHOP of New York.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, let me see if I have this  right. Our Republican colleagues are  telling us that we should forget about  the 15 months that have passed since  they started crafting the highway bill.  They’re  telling us we  should  forget  about the last 6 weeks during which  time their bill, H.R. 7, imploded and  the bipartisan MAP–21 bill passed the  Senate with overwhelming bipartisan  support. Now they’re telling the American people that they simply need 3 additional months to find the money and  shape a policy—an effort that thus far  has eluded them—that can garner a  majority of votes  in the House and  overcome the 60-vote threshold in the  Senate and be signed by the President  of the United States.  It gets better. On the very same day  that they make this outrageous argument, they will vote for a Republican  budget  that  slashes  investment  in  transportation  infrastructure  by  46  percent, a 46 percent reduction in investment in infrastructure.  Now,  if they’re serious about this  vote,  if they’re serious about seeing  this destructive  level of  funding enacted into law, how can we take them  seriously when they talk about a 5-  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:34 Mar 30, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29MR7.027 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2012

269,House,112,0.75,44,2012-03-29,Mr. MULVANEY.," Mr. Chairman, yesterday, before we had a chance to vote  on the President’s budget, I received a  copy of a press release from the White  House. It encouraged the House Democratic  leadership  to  vote  for  this  amendment. It encouraged the Democrats in the House to vote for the Van  Hollen  amendment,  which  I  just  thought was worthy of getting up and  talking about, very briefly.  It makes me wonder why the President didn’t send a press release asking  his Democrat colleagues to vote for his  budget. It makes me wonder what the  President is thinking. Does he like the  Van Hollen budget better than his own  budget? I mean, I guess there are some  things to like. The President’s budget  raised taxes by $1.9 trillion; the Van  Hollen budget only raises taxes by $1.7  trillion. The President’s budget raised  spending by $1.5 trillion; the Van Hollen amendment only raises it by $900  billion.  But it makes me wonder where the  President is. Does the President think  that his budget that he offered just a  month  ago  raises  taxes  too much,  raises spending too much? Is it too big  of a tax-and-spend document, now he  wants a little bit less of a tax-and-  spend document?

Senator MIKULSKI is an inspiration to us all. She had broken down not  only multiple gender barriers, but legislative, economic and societal barriers  as well.  Throughout her career, Senator MIKULSKIhas been a champion for those  who are often forgotten. Hubert Humphrey once said the moral test of government is how it treats those in the  dawn of life, the twilight of life and the  shadows of life. Senator MIKULSKItook  this message to heart. Her life has been  a life of service. She spent her career as  a tireless advocate, first as a social  worker in Baltimore on the city council and then in the House of Representatives where she served 10 years before  coming to the Senate. For the past 25  years she has continued this advocacy  and has been a strong voice on the Senate floor, as well as on the HELP Committee. I have been fortunate to serve  on the HELP Committee with Senator  MIKULSKIsince 2009.  One of the things Senator MIKULSKI  is best known  for  is providing good  constituent services. This is something  all Senate offices do and it often gets  overlooked by the national and international  issues of the day. But this  speaks to one of the most important  duties of a Senator.

The Republican budget cuts Medicare. It cuts Medicaid. It  cuts Pell Grants.  Yet, at the same time, their budget calls for  more spending on the weapons of last century’s Cold War. More nuclear bomb-making  plants. More nuclear missiles. More nuclear  subs.  Their budget fails to address the needs of  the elderly,  the children,  the sick, and  the  most vulnerable. It makes no sense. It is insane.  The CPC budget includes my legislation, the  Smarter Approach  to Nuclear Expenditures  Act—the SANE Act. SANE will save $100 billion over the next 10 years by reducing nuclear weapons spending. The CPC and  the  SANE Act puts people ahead of plutonium.

LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 28, 2012  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H. Con. Res. 112) establishing the budget for the United States  Government for fiscal year 2013 and setting  forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal  years 2014 through 2022:  ",2012
305,,112,-0.339,177,2012-03-29,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chair, I rise today  in strong support of the Congressional Black  Caucus Alternative Budget  for Fiscal Year  2013. The budget plan outlined by the CBC  takes a direct and balanced approach to restoring America’s promise, achieves fiscal responsibility and sets a priority to invest in our  future.  The CBC Alternative Budget protects Social  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, TANF,  Unemployment Insurance and other programs  that are vital  to  the most vulnerable populations, which are in districts throughout this  country.  Although our nation’s economy is showing  positive signs of growth, this Congress must  continue to make critical investments in communities  to accelerate—not stagger—our recovery.  To  that end,  the CBC Alternative Budget  makes smart investments in education, workforce  training, and  transportation and  infrastructure projects. These investments are necessary to ensure that America has a skilled  and educated workforce  that  is prepared  to  tackle the challenges of the 2ist Century and  compete with attempts to take American jobs  overseas.  Specifically, the CBC Budget will:  invest an additional $25 billion above  President’s  budget  in Education  and  Training in FY 2013 alone;  provide an additional $5 billion above  the  President’s Budget  request  for housing programs, foreclosure assistance, and other important programs for community development;  invest an additional $50 billion  in  job creating transportation and infrastructure projects  in FY 2013 alone and provide $155 billion  above  the President’s budget over  the next  decade; and  increase the maximum Pell Grant award by  nearly $1,000 over the President’s Fiscal Year  2013 budget request.  The CBC Budget acknowledges the deficit  and pays  for domestic priorities by enacting  the  Job  tax reform measures to raise nearly $4 trillion  in new revenue over the next decade through  the Buffet Rule to ensure that millionaires and  billionaires pay their fair share in taxes, and  closes  corporate  tax  loopholes  and  preferences  for corporations  that ship American  jobs overseas.  The $4 trillion in revenue raised from millionaires paying their fair share will allow us to  pay for an extension of tax cuts for hard working, middle class Americans—providing them  with more money  to  feed  their  families, pay  their bills, send their kids to school and fill up  their gas tanks.  The budget would open an enormous hole  in our country’s social safety net by  largely  shifting healthcare costs to seniors on Medicare, while at the same time giving millionaires  and billionaires a free pass by giving the rich  an average tax cut of $150,000.  In California alone, 5,252,371 seniors would  be forced onto vouchers when they retire—a  system  that has been shown  to be a sub-  standard version of Medicare.  The GOP budget will force seniors to pay  higher premiums in order to access the same  benefits they would receive under the current  system. For a typical 67 year-old senior, the  Ryan  budget  could  increase  out-of-pocket  health care costs by $5,900.  The GOP budget would decimate our primary assistance to the poor by cutting $3.3  trillion  from needed programs  like Medicaid  and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  In fact, a report conducted by the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities found that 62 percent of proposed cuts in the Ryan budget plan  come  from programs  that assist  low-income  individuals. This  is  the Republican vision:  to  balance the budget on the backs of the seniors and the poor.  The Ryan budget once again fails the test of  balance, fairness, and shared responsibility. It  takes a slash and burn approach to the budget, rather than going line by line to carefully  examine where cuts and new sources of revenue should be implemented.  The Ryan budget plan would weaken  job  growth. The Economic Policy  Institute  found  that if we were to follow Chairman RYAN’s proposal, 1.3 million jobs would be lost in 2013  and 2.8 million jobs would be lost in 2014.  Mr. Chair, the CBC Alternative Budget has  a better way. We understand that our current  economic situation calls for a balanced and responsible approach that protects our fragile recovery and invests in our future.  For these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the CBC Alternative Budget.  f  IN TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A.  BRINER  HON.

306,,112,0.339,184,2012-03-29,Mr. WALDEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to Max McIntosh,  the director of  the VA’s Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics (SORCC)  in White City, Oregon, who will retire tomorrow, March 30, after  39 years of service to the VA.  Since 2003, Max has  run  the SORCC,  transitioning it from a domiciliary into a world  class  rehabilitation center and a system of  clinics  for veterans  in southern Oregon. He  came to the clinic two years earlier as Chief  Operating Officer.  When he arrived, the SORCC served 7,000  outpatients  in  the  region—no  small  feat.  Today, through the good work of Max and his  staff of over 500 employees and another 500  volunteers, the SORCC cares for 450 residential patients and 18,000 outpatients in Southern Oregon. These are men and women who  have worn the nation’s uniform to defend our  freedom and cherished way of life, and they  deserve the highest levels of care. Max made  sure that they received it.  In his years as director of the SORCC, Max  and the facility have adapted to serve our nation’s  heroes—from  those who  served  in  World War II to Iraq and Afghanistan. Vocational rehabilitation and employment services  place veterans with community employers and  partners. They have programs  focused on  post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention, and clinics on chronic pain and diabetes. They  recently  instituted  a  system  of  home-based primary care, caring for veterans  in their homes.  Perhaps the greatest challenge he faced in  his tenure was among the first, when a proposal was floated to close or reduce services  at the SORCC. Max stood arm-in-arm with me  and the rest of the community as a fierce advocate for the facility. Today it stands as a nationally known veteran rehabilitation center, in  no small part because of Max’s leadership.  When I spent Veterans Day with Max and  the  veterans  of  southern Oregon  at  the  SORCC this past November, I noted that ‘‘A  nation is judged by the way it takes care of  the people who protect its freedom.’’ In his 39  years of service to our country, Max has made  us  proud.  I  understand  that  he’s  already  signed up to do volunteer work at the SORCC.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful community, state, and nation,  I  thank Max  for his  service to this country’s heroes, and wish him  well as he moves on.

307,,112,0.744,184,2012-03-29,Mr. HUELSKAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to join my colleagues in expressing my frustration with ABC News’ muckraking ‘‘journalism’’  that has forced the closure of a plant employing more than 200 people in my district.  What we have before us is a perfect example of mainstream media completely disconnected from reality. In a quest for accolades  and attention,  reporters,  talking heads, and  morning talk show hosts at ABC have made it  their  intention  to drive Beef Products,  Inc.  (BPI) out of business. And they may have succeeded. Despite developing a process  that  adds approximately $15 of value to each head  of  cattle  processed,  and  providing  safe,  healthy, lean meat for more than 300 billion  meals, BPI is being forced to close the doors  of its plant in Finney County, Kansas.  But while the reporters, producers, and executives at ABC move on to their next ‘‘public  interest’’ story as questions of finely textured  lean beef fade into the background, the same  cannot be said of employees at BPI. It is ironic  that a perfectly good ‘‘public interest’’ story for  them to cover is the loss of hundreds of jobs  for people  in my district and  from  the  three  other BPI plants across the country. But doing  so would bring too much attention to ABC’s  role in causing these people to lose their jobs.  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker—finely textured lean beef is just that: beef. In terms of  meat content, it is no different from the steak  being served at Charlie Palmer’s, or the hamburger at Five Guys. It’s not scrap, filler, or  substitute. It’s beef.  And it’s safe to eat. While much has been  made of the use of ammonia to treat the meat  once  it  is processed,  it has not been, and  should not be a safety concern. This process  has been approved by the USDA on a whole  host  of  food  products,  including  meat,  cheeses, chocolate, pudding, condiments, and  beverages  to prevent  food-borne diseases.

She was the  wife of the deceased Father Paul Washington,  the long time, much revered rector of the Episcopal Church of the Advocate, and an internationally recognized peace and rights activist.  But, Mrs. Washington was also a community  change agent. She founded the non-profit Advocate Community Development Corporation,  a  neighborhood-based  community  development  corporation  that  provided  affordable  housing and social services to the residents of  North Philadelphia. The bedrock of her family,  Mrs. Washington sang on  the choir,  taught  Sunday school, and helped out at the church’s  food kitchen that fed more for more than 350  people daily.  However, beyond all of these responsibilities  and accomplishments Mrs. Washington is remembered for his kindness, gentleness, and  graciousness. We were all blessed  to have  known her and we cherish her memory.  f  HONORING UTE AND PATRICK  GOGGINS  HON. LYNN C.

These people risked their lives to save  people who were going to be killed,  going to be put in gas chambers, never  to be heard from again. And 6 million  people died because there weren’t more  people  like Raoul Wallenberg  and  Schindler.  So, I just want to say I’ve heard from  my colleagues today the things that I  would like to have said, and they said  it very well; but I just say, in closing,  thank God that there are people who  are willing to risk their lives to help  their  fellow man. There  just aren’t  enough of them.

",2012
312,Senate,112,0.529,47,2012-04-16,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President,  I  have risen many times over the past 3  years to talk about the bad policy  choices of the Obama administration  and the harmful effects of these policies on our economy and on the American people.  In many ways, the President’s decisions have made things worse in our  country. The bill before us today would  impose what is being called the Buffett  tax. It is just one more example of a  policy that will hurt our economy, not  help it. This tax will take money from  the pockets of small businesses that  they would use to create jobs. More  than one-third of all business income  reported on individual returns would be  hit by this tax increase.  Back in September President Obama  said this tax hike on American families  would raise enough money not only to  pay for his increased spending but it  would ‘‘stabilize our debt and deficits  for the next decade.’’ Back then he  said:  ‘‘This  is not politics;  this  is  math.’’  Of course, we now know the Buffett  tax is only about one thing: politics.  The  increased  tax  revenue  would  amount to about $5 billion this year,  which  is about the same amount of  money Washington will borrow over  the next day and a half. The President  would have  to collect his  so-called  Buffett tax for more than 200 years just  to cover the Obama deficit from last  year alone. That is not just my math;  that is the math from the Joint Committee on Taxation.  The Buffett tax will not fix Washington’s debt because Washington doesn’t  have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. Even one of President  Obama’s top economic advisers finally  admits the Buffett tax will not ‘‘bring  the deficit down and the debt under  control.’’ Based on his record,  it  is  clear the President would not put a  single dollar raised by his new tax toward the debt. He will just spend it.  So the President has now changed his  story once again. Now he says this is  no longer a way to pay down the deficit. Now he says it is just a matter of  fairness.  President Obama has been using the  word ‘‘fair’’ in quite a few of his campaign speeches lately. It is a word of  great appeal to most people. Just like  ‘‘hope’’ and ‘‘change’’—the buzz words  of the 2008 Presidential campaign—people can interpret it to fit their own  meaning. President Obama’s  idea of  fairness doesn’t match up with  the  American people’s idea of fairness.  Senator MCCONNELLearlier made reference to an editorial I wrote in Investors Business Daily. President Obama  thinks it is fair that our children and  grandchildren will be burdened with  debt because of Washington’s reckless  spending, such as borrowing 42 cents of  every $1 it spent so far this year. President Obama thinks it was fair to pile  another  $40,000  of  debt  onto  every  household in the United States over  the last 3 years.  President Obama thinks it is fair to  use college students as props for his  campaign-style rallies without explaining how his bad policies will  leave  them in debt. President Obama thinks  it is fair to force hard-working taxpayers to subsidize a wealthy person’s  purchase of a hybrid  luxury car because it fits into his idea for American  energy.  President Obama thinks it is fair to  hand out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to politically connected  solar energy companies that then go  bankrupt. President Obama thinks it is  fair to tell thousands of workers they  will not have  jobs because he has  blocked  the Keystone XL Pipeline.  Why? To solidify his support with a few  far-left environmentalists.  President Obama thinks  it  is  fair  that more than half of his biggest fundraisers won jobs in his administration.  That is right, more than half, which  has been reported in the Washington  Post. President Obama thinks it is fair  to give important jobs to people who  fail to pay their own taxes, such as his  own Treasury Secretary.  Apparently, President Obama thinks  it is fair that 3 years of the Obama  economy have left us with more people  on food stamps, more people in poverty,  lower home values, higher gas  prices, and higher unemployment.  There are many ways in which the  American  people’s  understanding  of  ‘‘fairness’’ differs from the way President Obama has been using the word.  To the vast majority of Americans,  ‘‘fair’’ means an equal opportunity to  succeed. To President Obama,  ‘‘fair’’  requires nothing less than a total equal  outcome regardless of effort.  To most Americans, fairness allows  for the pursuit of their own dreams. It  also recognizes that no man and no  government can provide a guarantee of  success.  The waves of immigrants who have  come to our shores over generations  did so for freedom and for a chance to  succeed. They did not come to be taken  care of and  to have every decision  made  for  them by  the government.  That is what many of them were leaving behind.  When President Obama pushes  for  equal outcomes instead of equal opportunity, he is trying to pit one American against another. He is telling people it is not fair that someone else has  something they don’t have. That may  be a clever campaign tactic, but it is  not true, and it is bad for our country.  One person getting more does not mean  someone else has to get less. In America, it is possible for all of us to prosper. That is what made America different  from the very beginning—the  prospect that all of us can do better—  not at the expense of our neighbors but  by our own effort.  There is something that threatens to  keep all of us from success. It is the  thing that threatens to keep us all  from passing on to our children the  hope for their own prosperity. It is the  crushing debt, the debt this administration has been forcing onto the backs  of American workers. It is the mountain of bureaucracy that stifles American opportunity.  The old maxim says that a rising tide  lifts all boats. President Obama seems  to think it is better to put holes in all  of the boats as long as that means they  are all equal in the end. That is what  he seemed to be saying in 2008 during  one of the Democratic Presidential debates.  Moderator  Charles  Gibson  asked  then-Senator Obama why he  favored  raising taxes on capital gains. Our history clearly showed that when the tax  rate has gone up, government revenues  actually went down. Senator Obama  said he wanted to raise taxes anyway  ‘‘for purposes of fairness.’’  In the name of achieving what he  considers to be fair, the President was  willing to hurt millions of hard-working families who already paid taxes on  their  income—families who  invested  some of that income and now would  have to pay higher taxes again when  they decide to sell some of those investments. The President didn’t even  care if Washington ended up with less  money as a result of his efforts to punish success. The only important thing  was that he thought it would be more  fair.  That is a pretty extreme definition of  what ‘‘fair’’ means, and it is not one  the American people share. In any fair  society, doing better should be a consequence of one’s efforts. To President  Obama, fairness means getting something for nothing.

I am proud to recognize these four young men for their brave  heroics in helping 53 Miami Trace elementary  school  children off an overturned bus on  March 12, 2012.  At 4:16 p.m. on March 12, a school bus  transporting children home from school veered  off the road and rolled onto its right side into  a ditch. With  the passenger door pinned  against the ground, Wade Aills made the decision  to kick open  the emergency rear door.  The four boys then proceeded to aid the elementary children in exiting the bus and keeping everyone calm until emergency personnel  could arrive. When EMS units arrived on the  scene, all of the children had been evacuated  safely, with only a few children that suffered  minor injuries.  Recently,  these young men were honored  and  recognized  by  the  Fayette  County  Sherriff’s Office and the Miami Trace elementary school for their actions.

316,,112,0.332,96,2012-04-16,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my distinct honor to rise today to commend  and congratulate  the University of Kentucky  Wildcats men’s basketball  team on winning  the 2012 NCAA Men ’s Division  I Basketball  Championship.  By now, any basketball fan is familiar with  the legacy of the Wildcats. The ‘ ‘Greatest Tradition in College Basketball,’ ’ Kentucky is the  winningest program of all-time, both  in  total  wins and  total win percentage, and  the  first  team to break the 2,000 win threshold. Kentucky has fifteen Final Four appearances, and  now eight national  championships,  second  only to UCLA.  Even measured against  this pedigree and  the  impossibly high expectations of  the Big  Blue Nation, this batch of ’Cats was something  special.  ‘The Undeniables,’ ’  as  they  are  known, were ranked number one in the nation  for most of the year, losing only two games on  their way to setting the NCAA record of thirty-  eight wins in a single season. During their remarkable NCAA  tournament  run  they won  each game by an astonishing average of ten  points, never trailing in a second half. While  the title was the ultimate goal, the Final Four  victory over instate rival the University of Louisville may have been even sweeter, as the  highest stakes game ever played in the historic  rivalry and  the most  important single  sporting event in the history of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  This  team achieved greatness against extraordinary competition because of the players’  love and respect for one another. It is telling  that a  team  led by  three  freshmen and  two  sophomores all forecast to be first round NBA  draft picks, and all used to scoring 25 points  a night in high school, were known first and  foremost for their defense.

317,,112,0.54,103,2012-04-16,Mr. OLSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to  interact with some of the brightest students in  the 22nd Congressional District who serve on  my Congressional Youth Advisory Council.  I  have gained much by  listening  to  the high  school students who are  the  future of  this  great nation. They provide  important  insight  into the concerns of our younger constituents  and hopefully get a better sense of the importance of being an active participant in the political process. Many of the students have written short essays on a variety of topics and I  am pleased to share these with my House colleagues.  Drew Liscum is a senior at Kempner High  School in Fort Bend County, Texas. His essay  topic is: In your opinion, what role should government play in our lives?  People as a whole seem to receive adequate  information about what the government actually does in a very unique way. The reason  being is that the government, in about every  country, controls what is seen and what is  not seen. They control key aspects to people’s lives. I believe in the truth . . . whether  it hurts me or not.  For instance, why is it said nationwide and  even worldwide, that politicians are ‘‘liars.’’  Well maybe it’s because they are simply talented at hiding the blunt truth. When a  friend asks for an opinion about their hair or  if they look good, it’s ok to throw in a white  lie to not hurt their feelings. But when you  lie to your country, it’s different on so many  levels. I’m not saying that our government  lies, but I’m not saying that they tell the  truth either. People refer to government as a  system for the way it works. If you’re in the  government, your punishments are much  less crucial than that of an average citizen.  For example, a man named Michael Lund  was arrested on October 28th, 2011 for driving  while  intoxicated. He was  trying  to cut  through a blocked off accident scene a little  after eleven-thirty. Michael Lund is the captain of the Sugar Land Police Department.  The men that arrested him were Stafford Policemen. The same types of charges were also  given to a dear friend of mine. His charges  were not withheld or cut back. The point is  that  the government  should be equal  in  every aspect. Whether it’s a case or the truth  being put forward, everyone should know the  same and be treated the same.  In the documentary,  ‘‘Dear Zachary,’’ a  man, Andrew Bagby, was killed in 2001 after  breaking up with his girlfriend. After she denied murdering him to several cops and people, she moved to Canada. Bagby’s family  still pressed charges against her, but now it  was a little more difficult. Shortly after living in Canada, she announced herself to be  Pregnant. Andrews parents now became a  bigger part of the picture. They wanted to  gain custody of Zachary. On August 18th,  Shirley Turner takes her son, Zacahary, far  out into the middle of the ocean and drowns  the both of them. On December 15th, 2010,  Governor General David  Johnston  gave  Royal Assent to Bill C–464: An Act To Amend  the Criminal Code, making it law in Canada.  The bill has added an amendment to Canada’s criminal code giving courts the right  to refuse bail to someone charged with a serious crime who is deemed a potential danger  to children under the age of i8.  The argument on what role the government should play in our lives will go on forever. The problem is that they need to be  there for us when we need them, and also  know when to step down and let us live our  own  lives. People such as Shirley Turner  should be taken care of here  in America  while she is extremely dangerous and all evidence is pointing towards her. The government needs to understand to play their own  role before they decide to play it in ours.  f  HONORING MR.  HEZEKIAH WATKINS FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE  GREENWOOD, MISSISSIPPI COMMUNITY  HON.

318,,112,0.302,110,2012-04-16,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and acknowledge the volunteers of  Clarion, Iowa, for their hard work and becoming 2012 National Honorees of Make a Difference Day. This year, more than a thousand  citizens of Clarion participated in Make a Difference Day activities, earning them the prestigious honor as one of  the nation’s 2012  Make a Difference Day winners.  Make a Difference Day is a celebration of  the power of neighbors helping neighbors.  Created by USA Weekend, this annual day of  service mobilizes more than 3 million volunteers nationwide to create positive change in  their communities.  This group of outstanding volunteers  from  this three-stoplight town of 2,800 has made a  substantial impact in their community by completing hundreds of small acts of kindness that  culminated in their well-deserved national recognition. From crocheting robes for seniors to  cleaning ditches, from raking leaves to running  errands for neighbors in need, this small town  came together a thousand strong to make an  unforgettable  impact on Make a Difference  Day.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is an honor  to  represent  Clarion and  its citizens  in  the United States  Congress and  I  trust my colleagues  in  the  House will rise  to  join me  in congratulating  them on a job well done. Clarion has shown  the nation once again  that small  towns can  surely do big things.  f  IN  COMMEMORATION  OF  THE  AMERICAN  LIBERATORS  OF  WORLD WAR  II AND THE  25TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  INTERNATIONAL MARCH OF THE LIVING  HON.

319,,112,0.259,110,2012-04-16,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the accomplishment of a constituent  of mine Mrs. Rebecca Poe; specifically her  twenty-six years of service as Executive Director of  the Randolph County Senior Center  along with her other accomplishments as Randolph County director for North Central Community Action, campaign chairman for United  Way of Randolph County, President of  the  Elkins Rotary Club and her service on  the  board of Elkins Rehabilitation & Care Center.  Rebecca, whose first day as Executive Director of the Randolph County Senior Center  was July 1, 1985, will work her final day on  April 27, 2012. When Rebecca took over the  Senior Center it was a small operation with a  staff of seven people. Today it has a staff of  about 120,  including both  full-time and part-  time positions.  Under Rebecca ’s guidance the Senior Center home care program began in 1988 with a  nurse and coordinator. Today the program has  140 clients and features two full time nurses  and a support staff. In 1989 under Rebecca ’s  guidance, the Senior Center made use of a  seven-county  regional grant  to upgrade  the  nutrition program for their seniors. The Country Roads Transportation program began  in  2006 to transport riders of any age.  Although Rebecca has helped  the Senior  Center make great strides over the years, she  insists that the center and the many people  she ’s gotten  to know  there over  the years  have made just as big an impact on her.  Mr. Speaker, as the nation ’s baby boomers  move into their senior years, we certainly need  more people like Rebecca Poe and the outstanding level of care to our aging population.  I  thank Rebecca  for her years of service  and Randolph County is fortunate to call Rebecca one of its own.

320,House,112,0.6,3,2012-04-25,Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee.," Mr.  Speaker, last night I had the privilege  of sitting with University of Tennessee  Coach Pat Head Summitt as she received the top award presented by the  National Alzheimer’s Association. This  is the Sargent and Eunice Shriver Profiles in Dignity Award, and it was presented by their well-known daughter,  Maria.  No one could have been more deserving of this award than Coach Summitt.  As the Nation knows, she was diagnosed with early onset dementia, or  Alzheimer’s, almost a year ago. She  made the decision to both go public  with this diagnosis and continue coaching her beloved Lady Vols. Now she has  decided to give up her coaching  job  after 38 years to help lead the fight  against Alzheimer’s. She and her son,  Tyler, have established the Pat Head  Summitt Foundation to carry on this  battle that is and will be so very, very  important to millions of people.  Pat Head Summitt is certainly the  most admired and respected woman in  Tennessee. She is my most famous constituent and a longtime friend. I have  been honored on two occasions to be  her honorary assistant coach. The first  time was on her 25th anniversary as a  coach, and the second time was a few  years later against Vanderbilt on the  last home game of the season. Before  that game, we were given a scouting  report, and Tennessee had beaten Vanderbilt in Nashville by 30 points. So it  was accurate to say that the team was  fairly confident about this game. However, at halftime, the game was almost  tied, and the Lady Vols came into the  locker room with their heads hanging  down.  That is when I saw Coach Summitt  go into action. She got into each young  woman’s face like a baseball manager  arguing with an umpire. She started  with Lady Vol Teresa Geter, and told  her in a drill sergeant’s voice that she  was going through a pity party out  there and Coach Summitt was having  no part of it and was giving her 2 minutes to make her presence known on  that court or she was going to yank her  out of there so fast it would make her  head swim. When we went back out for  the second half, the first thing that  happened was that Teresa Geter stole  the ball, took it down court, and scored  her  first 2 points of the game. The  Lady Vols went on a 20–0 run, and Vanderbilt called a timeout.  A spectator in the stands, whom I  had not seen because there were 20,000  people there, sent his card down to me  on the bench, and  it said,  ‘‘Jimmy,  great halftime coaching, come again.’’  But  it was not me;  it was Coach  Summitt. In fact, when she was staring  each one of her players in the face at  halftime in an intensely angry, very  loud voice, I was just glad I was not  one of those players.  Coach Summitt  is  the winningest  coach in basketball history with 1,098  victories. Her  teams  have won  16  Southeastern  Conference  Championships and  eight national  championships. She has coached  in  18 Final  Fours. She has an 84 percentage winning record as a head coach. But to me,  her most impressive statistic is a 100  percent graduation rate, and she did  not allow her players to take easy  courses. Let me  repeat  that. Every  player who has ever played for Coach  Summitt in her 38 years has graduated.  She made sure they were prepared for  life after basketball, and almost all of  her players have been successful after  leaving the University of Tennessee.  On top of all this, she has never had a  question raised about her recruiting or  any NCAA violation. She has shown  through the years that you do not have  to cheat in sports to win and be very  successful.  She has succeeded at her most important job—being a mother and raising  her fine son, Tyler, who is following in  his mother’s footsteps and will soon  start his first job as an assistant coach  for the Marquette women’s basketball  team.  Coach Summitt is a member of the  Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame and  was NCAA Coach of the Year an unprecedented seven times. In 2008 she  was named the Naismith Coach of the  Year. Pat Head Summitt is a woman of  honor and integrity. She has been a  great, great success because of her very  hard work, dedication, determination,  and discipline. Most of her success she  credits to hardworking parents and lessons learned on her family’s Tennessee  farm. This Nation  is a better place  today because of her work with young  people and the inspiring example that  she has set for all of us.  Coach Pat Head Summitt is truly a  great American, and I’m proud to call  her one of my constituents and, as I  said, one of my very, very close friends.  f  THE STUDENT LOAN  AFFORDABILITY ACT  ",2012

But what we have to commit ourselves to is, if we do not act by the end  of the year, the largest tax increase in  the history of America will go into effect with the expiration of the individual tax rates, the reinstatement of  the estate taxes at levels of 55 percent  and beyond, and we need to act.

My message to our colleagues in the  House of Representatives is very clear  and direct: we’ve got to continue to cap  student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent.  Student-loan  borrowers  and  their  families should not have to pay more  on their student-loan debt. The President has done all he can do right now  to help bring relief to our student-loan  borrowers. Now it’s time for Congress  to act, but Congress has to do more. We  need to reform the system. We’ve got  to change the system. That’s why I  wrote and introduced the Student Loan  Forgiveness Act of 2012. It will help cut  student-loan debt, free up borrowers’  money so they can invest it on their  own. That’s a real economic stimulus  that will create jobs here in this country.  So I want to thank you again, Mr.  GARAMENDI, for yielding me time.  ",2012
326,Senate,112,0.414,66,2012-04-25,Mr. MORAN.," Madam President, as  certainly every Kansan and all Americans know, our gas prices are on the  rise and the U.S. economy continues to  struggle. I believe one of the most important things Congress can do now is  to facilitate the production of affordable energy in this country. In Kansas,  we have the third highest number of  highway miles  in any State  in the  country, so higher fuel prices are particularly  difficult  for Kansans who  drive long distances each day for work  and school. When business owners pay  more for fuel, they have less to invest  in their businesses and fewer resources  to use to hire new employees.  In our State, higher fuel prices increase operating costs for farmers and  ranchers who produce much of our Nation’s food supply. One Kansas farmer  feeds 155 people. The global food supply  is threatened when food producers have  to pay high costs to plant, harvest, and  transport their production.  Higher gas prices don’t just affect the  farmer or rancher filling their equipment; they also affect every American  as they shop at their grocery store.  While producers have to pay higher  fuel costs, so do the folks who transport the goods to market. So that increased cost gets passed on to the consumer. We all are paying more.  For  the United States  to  remain  competitive  in this global economy,  Congress must develop a comprehensive national energy policy. No single  form of energy can provide all the answers. High fuel prices and an uncertain energy supply will continue until  we take serious steps toward increasing the development of our own natural  resources.  Our country has some of the most  plentiful, affordable, and reliable energy sources available. Our own Congressional Research Service has  reported the United States has greater  energy  resources  than China, Saudi  Arabia, and Canada combined. Unfortunately, access to those resources continues to be restricted.  Technological advances have made  the exploration, extraction, and transportation of oil and gas safer and more  efficient. Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly blocked efforts to  expand energy production. In the President’s State of the Union Address, he  claimed oil and gas production has increased under his leadership. While private lands are being further developed,  and  energy production  is being  increased on those private lands, energy  production on Federal lands has actually decreased. According to the Department of the Interior, oil production on Federal property fell by 14 percent and natural gas production fell by  11 percent last year.  The failure to explore and develop  our vast natural resources on Federal  lands hit an unfortunate milestone last  week. Ten years ago, the Senate failed  to open a fractional portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve for responsible resource development. Those  opposed to developing that small portion of that vast area claimed the resources available in ANWR would not  reach the market for 10 years. Well,  here we are, 10 years later, no closer  than we were in 2002 to gaining our energy independence.  American businesses involved in the  oil and gas industry can bring these resources to market and send a strong  signal to the world that the United  States is serious about energy security.  Yet rather than allowing these companies to deploy their expertise and increase production, there are those who  say oil and gas companies deserve even  more  taxes—a  tax  increase. Raising  taxes on the very businesses tasked  with locating, extracting, and distributing the fuel to power our economy  would do nothing to lower costs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In  fact, it would do exactly the opposite.  When  the Congressional Research  Service  analyzed President Obama’s  fiscal year 2012 budget proposal  last  year to raise taxes on the oil and gas  companies, they concluded those efforts would have the effect of ‘‘decreasing exploration, development and production while increasing prices and increasing the nation’s  foreign oil dependence.’’ The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service  says  these  taxes would  reduce domestic  supply  and hurt consumers.  To  increase domestic production, I  have  sponsored  the  3–D Act, which  would require the administration to reverse their cancellation of dozens of oil  and gas leases, open areas previously  restricted to responsible oil and gas development, such as the Arctic National  Wildlife Reserve, and streamline the  environmental review process that continually  ties up worthy projects  in  costly bureaucracy and litigation.  The administration is also delaying  projects that will improve our energy’s  infrastructure. The President’s denial  of TransCanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline  permit delayed an  important project  that would create thousands of  jobs  and bring billions to the U.S. economy.  This private investment in energy infrastructure is exactly the type of investment the President should be encouraging. Construction projects create jobs and boost local economies.  For example, back home in Kansas,  Clay County is a small, lowly populated county. Their utility  sales  to  TransCanada  could  quadruple  their  overall sales and add more than $1⁄2  million to the  local economy every  year. This would be a significant boost  to the county’s economic development.  President Obama’s own Jobs Council  cited the pipeline construction as a  way to boost the economy  in their  year-end  report  released January of  this year, stating:  Policies  that  facilitate  safe,  thoughtful  and timely development of pipeline, transmission and distribution projects are necessary to facilitate the delivery of America’s  fuel and electricity and maintain the reliability of our nation’s energy system.  But TransCanada’s project has been  stalled as the company works to seek a  new route through the State of Nebraska, to our north. But instead of  putting the entire project on hold, we  would be much better off if we would  allow construction to begin in areas  not subject to this rerouting so jobs  could be created and our Nation could  have greater access to more reliable  energy. S. 2041, which I have sponsored,  would do that.  Renewable energy must also play a  role in supplying our energy needs as  new  technologies allow  for  the  increased commercialization of  renewable fuels. Kansas is a leader in wind  production and second only to Texas in  wind resource potential. Innovation in  biofuel production has also increased  our ability to develop additional energy from renewable sources available  in my home State of Kansas.  Nuclear energy is a necessary component that will help us supply our country’s future energy needs and allow our  country to be less reliant on energy  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:04 Apr 26, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G25AP6.003 S25APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2012

I  know energy production is very important to his State and, obviously, to our  Nation.  I know he has a wealth of  knowledge regarding this issue. I candidly enjoyed hearing his remarks, and  I look forward to hearing the balance  of them at another time.  I am going to be very brief. I came  down here because  I am distressed  about where we find ourselves. I want  to thank the ranking member and the  chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee who is dealing with postal  reform.  I  thank  them  for working  through the committee process and actually bringing a bill to the floor in  that manner, something we do not do  enough of around here. I thank them  for allowing us to have amendments,  free-for-all, as  it relates to matters  pertinent to this bill. I thank them for  their work. Personally, I would like to  see a lot more reforms take place in  the postal bill.  There is no question we are kicking  the can down the road, and we are  going to revisit this in another couple  of years. Because of the way the bill is  designed, I don’t think there is any  question that is going to happen.  But I want to speak to the fact that  the world, our Nation, and all of our  citizens watched us last August as this  country almost came to a halt as we  voted on a proposal  to  reduce  the  amount of deficit spending that is taking place in our Nation at a time when  the debt ceiling was being increased.  There was a lot of drama around that.  Both sides of the aisle came together  and established a discretionary cap on  the amount of money that we would  spend in 2012 and 2013.  Again, the whole world and certainly  most citizens in our Nation were glued  to the television or reading newspaper  accounts about what was happening. In  a bipartisan way, at a time when our  Nation has tremendous deficits, we basically committed to pare down spending.  What is happening with this bill, and  the  same  thing happened with  the  highway bill that was just passed, is  that people on both sides of the aisle  are saying: You know, the Postal Service is very popular. Therefore, what we  are going to do is not worry about the  budget caps we have put in place.  It is hard for me to believe. I know  there is a lot of accounting around the  postal reform bill that is difficult for  people to comprehend. But what is happening with this bill, both the ranking  and chair continue to talk about the  fact that some money came from the  Postal Service into the general fund  and now is just being repaid. By the  way, I agree with that. But the problem is it still increases our deficit by  $11 billion, and it absolutely violates  the agreement we put in place last August 2.  The responsible way for us to deal  with this is say we understand this is  money that should go back to the Postal Service, but to live within the agreement we put in place we need to take  $11 billion from someplace else.  What I fear is getting ready to happen today—and I know there was a  budget point of order placed against  this bill. I supported that budget point  of  order. The  ranking  and  chair—  whom, again, I respect tremendously—  said let’s go through this process and  see if there are some amendments that  actually pare down the cost. That is  not happening. So what I fear is going  to happen this afternoon is that in an  overwhelmingly bipartisan way, Congress is going to say one more time to  the American people: You absolutely  cannot  trust us  to deal with your  money because we are Western politicians—Western democracies are having  the same problems in Europe—and basically the way we get reelected is we  spend your money on things that you  like without asking for any repayment  of any kind.  That is what has happened in this  Nation for decades. That is what we are  seeing play out right now in Europe.  We are able to watch the movie of what  is going to happen to this great Nation.  We have politicians in this Chamber  who have agreed to what we are going  to spend this year and already, because  we have two popular bills, in a bipartisan way people are saying: It doesn’t  matter what we agreed to. We do not  care  that  the  biggest  generational  theft that has ever occurred in this Nation  is continuing. We are basically  taking money  from our children  to  keep us in elective office by not making tough choices.  I am afraid that is what is going to  happen this afternoon on this bill. I am  just coming down one more time to appeal to people on both sides of the aisle  who are participating in this to say:  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:04 Apr 26, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G25AP6.022 S25APPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2012

One of  the  complaints  I heard  from  postmasters when they came to talk to me  about this bill is that they think there  is a lot of middle management in the  Postal Service making unwise decisions, and if they were given more autonomy at the local level to make decisions about  their post offices,  they  would have the ability to have cost-  saving measures to try to save the post  office  for  their  local community.  I  think this makes sense. I think we  would have more innovation and get  some useful ideas from our local postmasters.  I yield back the remainder of my  time.  ",2012

The students  involved  in  this program wrote over  4,000 letters for our servicemembers this year.  This program seeks  to give  thanks  to  the  most  deserving  among  us,  the men  and  women  of  our  Armed  Forces.  Donna  Monteleone Randle, a  former captain  in  the  Army Signal Corps, serves as the chairperson  of Valentines  for Troops  in Newtown, Connecticut and helps the organization send letters from the students to the servicemembers  overseas.

Furthermore I want to honor  the heroic actions of  these volunteer  firefighters,  law enforcement officers and paramedics for their selfless devotion to their communities.  On Wednesday, April 27, 2011, the State of  Alabama experienced the worst tornado outbreak since 1974 and possibly the deadliest  the State has ever seen. The small Northwest  Alabama towns of Hackleburg and Phil Campbell  were  completely  devastated  by  the  storms. The storms left a path of destruction  through the towns at least half a mile wide,  destroying numerous houses and businesses  as well as both high schools, the fire and police stations in Hackleburg and severely damaging the city hall in Phil Campbell. Worst of  all, the tornadoes took the lives of 18 people  in the Hackleburg area and 27 people in Phil  Campbell.  During  the difficult hours and days  immediately  following  the  tornadoes of April 27,  2011, the first responders of Hackleburg, Phil  Campbell, Marion County and Franklin County  acted with  the utmost professionalism and  bravery when called to duty. Despite the carnage,  they performed  their duties with valor  and perseverance. Many of them were working to assist others while not knowing whether  their own families were safe. During the first  frantic hours—and even days—of the search  and rescue effort, sleep was not an option.  They had a mission to do: to coordinate emergency work and retain order even while the  debris-littered streets were  the same  route  used to carry out the wounded and deceased  and to welcome in relief workers from neighboring communities. But  through  it all,  they  never lost sight of the people they had sworn  to serve and the spirit that has held their communities together.  On behalf of the citizens of the Fourth Congressional District of Alabama, I commend the  brave men and women of  the volunteer  fire  departments,  law enforcement agencies and  paramedics for their courage, selflessness and  commitment to their communities. They, along  with the resilient folks they serve, have begun  to pick up the pieces of their shattered towns.  I have every confidence  that  the Towns of  Hackleburg and Phil Campbell will fully rebuild  and be better than ever.  f  TO  RECOGNIZE  BATTLEFIELD  HIGH SCHOOL’S PARTICIPATION  IN THE STOCK MARKET GAME’S  ‘‘CAPITOL HILL CHALLENGE’’  HON.

Sadly,  for  the past  39  months, our Nation’s unemployment  rate has remained at or above 8 percent. It is gruesomely clear that the  President’s  failed  policies  are  not  working for young Americans but, instead, are destroying jobs, with 54 percent of college graduates under 25 unemployed or underemployed.  The most  recent  report confirmed  that more than 500,000 of discouraged  Americans have given up searching for  a job in the last 2 months. If the labor  force remained the same size as 2009,  when the President was sworn into office, our Nation’s unemployment rate  would be at 11 percent. The President’s  policies are  failing young Americans  with shrinking jobs and growing deficits with  devastating  interest  payments.  f  CONGRATULATING ZIPPO  MANUFACTURING COMPANY  (Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Zippo  employs  approximately  900  people in Bradford, which is a community  of  approximately  8,000  people,  making it the largest employer in the  county.  Zippo has been making lighters since  1895 and became very popular during  World War II. Next month, Zippo will  celebrate the production of its 500 millionth windproof pocket lighter at the  company’s manufacturing plant. The  actual 500 millionth Zippo lighter will  be classic brushed chrome with two-  tone engraving and an individual serial  number of ‘‘1.’’  But  it’s not  just the number that  Zippo and its employees will celebrate;  it’s that over the years Zippo has developed an iconic brand; it’s that consumers in over 160 countries around the  world buy Zippo products; it’s that despite the drastic downturn in the economy, Zippo, through hard work and innovation, has continued to successfully  grow its business, support our domestic  manufacturers and the strength of our  communities.  For these reasons, Zippo CEO Gregory Booth was recently nominated to  serve on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Manufacturing Council.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

336,Senate,112,0.538,50,2012-05-07,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, there is no  reason we should be having this debate  today. Freezing student loan interest  rates for 1 year during tough economic  times  is something I believe we all  agree on, so it should be relatively simple to accomplish. The President supports it, Governor Romney supports it,  and a bipartisan majority in both the  House  and  the Senate  supports  it.  Given this kind of agreement, I see no  reason why both sides could not have a  good-faith discussion on where to find  the $6 billion in savings in a government with a budget that spends nearly  $2 trillion annually. Actually, we spend  more than $2 trillion annually.  I would mention, this bill has not  been to committee. I hope the American people have noticed that bills that  go to committee and then come to the  floor are usually  successful.  I hope  they also notice that bills that do not  go to committee and come to the floor  are usually not successful; they are  usually a political statement. That is  what we have here again today.  This is how it works: You bring a bill  that you know the other side—well, in  fact, this body has already voted on the  concept of this tax before and defeated  it. They know with that provision in  there, this common interest will fail.  So why do they do it? Well, you notice  this  is a motion to proceed and requires a cloture vote. So 40 of us can  stop this bill, and will stop this bill in  the condition it is in without having  gone to committee. But when we stop  things,  it  seems  those Republicans  think that students ought to be paying  more interest. That is the part that is  wrong. The part we are disagreeing  about is how to pay for it.  Pay  for  it? We have an economic  judgment day coming in this country  because of the debt we are running up  on a daily basis. That is what put the  world into kind of this funk anyway. I  am not sure what is going to happen  now that France has decided they are  not going to have austerity and Greece  has decided they are not going to have  austerity. Now they have leaders who  say they are going to fight any kind of  austerity. It could put the world in a  real crisis.  But what we are talking about  is  whether to keep the student interest  rate at the low rate that it is right  now, and we are going to have to vote  on a bill that we are going to have to  defeat because of the pay-for  in  it,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:21 May 17, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\S07MY2.REC S07MY2 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2012

338,Senate,112,0.552,64,2012-05-07,Mr. INHOFE.,"  Madam  President,  today I wish to submit for the RECORD  my remarks and a speech by Taiwan’s  top diplomat in Washington, Jason C.  Yuan, of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, who announced on April 25, 2012, the donation  by his government of 1,150 metric tons  of rice to Kenya through Feed the Children, a well-known and respected charity based in my home State of Oklahoma.  The food emergency in the Horn of  Africa is a stark humanitarian crisis  and Kenya  simply has not  received  enough rain to feed its people. Record-  high food prices, internal conflicts, and  insecurity in the region have exacerbated the situation. With malnutrition  and disease on the rise, dane Kenyan  families are required to travel long distances in search of food. It is evident  that outside help must be provided.  The people of Taiwan are providing  that help. Its generous gift will have an  immediate  impact  on  relieving  the  hardships  brought  on  by  this  first  drought of the 21st century.  Ronald Reagan once  said  that  ‘‘a  hungry child knows no politics,’’ meaning that the American people are always willing to open up their hearts  and the blessings of their bounty to the  less fortunate around the world. The  people of Taiwan are doing the same  thing today through this generous donation.  Some may say that this gracious donation of rice is a mere drop in the  bucket compared to the overall need in  Africa. Yet one must remember that  every mighty wave starts with a tiny  ripple.  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORD remarks from  Ambassador Jason C. Yuan.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  AMBASSADORJASONC.

On behalf of my government, I am pleased  to announce that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan), in cooperation with the Red Cross of  the Republic of China and Feed the Children  have decided to form an alliance to donate  1,150 metric tons of rice to Kenya, a country  currently suffering a famine. This partnership will allow the rice donation from Taiwan to be distributed with the help of FTC in  refugee camps, to ongoing relief efforts in  Turkana  and  to  primary  schools  in  Mombasa, Kenya.  Feed the Children is one of the largest  international  charities,  with  its  headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and  based on Christian values. It has been dedicated to providing hope and resources for  those without  life’s essentials throughout  the United States and the world for decades.  Taiwan and FTC have associated in the  past and successfully cooperated in 2005 to  deliver 10,000 metric tons of rice to the tsunami ravaged areas in Indonesia. In 2006 Taiwan donated 52 containers of new clothing to  FTC worth approximately US $17.6 million,  which were later distributed to more than  16,000 children, orphans, elderly, abandoned  and others in need in 11 countries (Honduras,  Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador,  Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Azerbaijan,  Russia, Armenia, and Ukraine). In 2007, Taiwan donated 5,000 metric tons of rice to  Kenya and 5,000 metric tons of rice to Malawi through FTC, to help people in those  two countries suffering from famine. In 2011,  Taiwan donated 100 metric tons of rice to restart the Mombasa Kenya School Feeding  Program, benefiting  27,000 children  for  2  school terms.  Enhancing  Taiwan’s  contributions  to  international development  is one of  the  three  lines of defense that President Ma  Ying-jeou has outlined  for the ROC’s national security. As a maturing democracy  and  thriving  economy, Taiwan has been  shouldering our own responsibilities in the  world. Humanitarian work has become an especially  important platform  for Taiwan’s  contributions to the international community. Taiwan’s  democracy  and  economic  prosperity have combined to give rise to a vibrant society of numerous non-profit organizations. In almost every major disaster relief  program that has occurred in the world recently, Taiwan has been an important contributor, whether this meant providing financial aid to help rebuild homes in Sichuan,  or giving life-sustaining medical aid to Haitian children. Taiwan was also one of the  first to arrive with emergency relief supplies  and rescue teams when Japan was struck by  the triple disaster of an earthquake, tsunami  and nuclear incident. In fact, Taiwan ended  up donating more than US $200 million to  the Japanese people.  Last week, President Ma just wrapped up a  12-day official visit to Burkina Faso, Gambia  and Swaziland, our three allies in Africa.  Pursuing a policy of viable diplomacy that  requires that all foreign assistance must be  justified, legitimate and efficient, President  Ma announced a donation of US $2.1 million  worth of support to Mali refugee assistance  efforts in Burkina Faso, and US $3 million to  emergency food programs in Gambia. The  project ‘‘A Lamp Lighting up Africa’’ also  helps the students of our West African allies  study at night with LED lamps.  The Republic of China used to be a country  that  received  economic  assistance  from  other  countries,  particularly  the United  States. Now that we are better off, the least  we can do is to help other people in need. So  we look forward to future cooperation with  Feed the Children or other NGOs  in the  United States for the good cause. Thank you!  f  FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN  ECUADOR  ",2012
339,,112,-0.582,85,2012-05-07,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, an op-ed  in  the April 19, 2012 Wall Street Journal by Mark  Spitznagel  explains  how  the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing program,  in place  since the financial crisis of 2008, has continued the massive transfer of wealth from the  Middle Class directly to the richest.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 19, 2012]  HOWTHEFEDFAVORSTHE1%  (By Mark Spitznagel)  A major issue in this year’s presidential  campaign is the growing disparity between  rich and poor, the 1% versus the 99%. While  the president’s solutions differ from those of  his likely Republican opponent, they both ignore a principal source of this growing disparity.  The source is not runaway entrepreneurial  capitalism, which rewards those who best  serve the consumer  in product and price.  (Would we really want it any other way?)  There is another force that has turned a natural divide into a chasm: the Federal Reserve. The relentless expansion of credit by  the Fed creates artificial disparities based  on political privilege and economic power.  David Hume,  the  18th-century Scottish  philosopher, pointed out that when money is  inserted into the economy (from a government printing press or, as in Hume’s time,  the importation of gold and silver), it is not  distributed evenly but ‘‘confined to the coffers of a few persons, who immediately seek  to employ it to advantage.’’  In the 20th century, the economists of the  Austrian school built upon this fact as their  central monetary tenet. Ludwig von Mises  and his students demonstrated how an increase in money supply is beneficial to those  who get it first and is detrimental to those  who get it last. Monetary inflation is a process, not a static effect. To think of it only in  terms of aggregate price levels (which is all  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke seems capable  of) is to ignore this pernicious process and  the imbalance and economic dislocation that  it creates.  As Mises prote´ge´Murray Rothbard explained, monetary inflation is akin to counterfeiting, which necessitates that some benefit and others don’t. After all, if everyone  counterfeited in proportion to their wealth,  there would be no real economic benefit to  anyone. Similarly, the expansion of credit is  uneven  in the economy, which results  in  wealth redistribution. To borrow a visual  from another Mises student, Friedrich von  Hayek, the Fed’s money creation does not  flow evenly like water into a tank, but rather oozes like honey into a saucer, dolloping  one area first and only then very slowly dribbling to the rest. The Fed doesn’t expand the  money supply by uniformly dropping cash  from helicopters over the hapless masses.  Rather, it directs capital transfers to the  largest banks (whether by overpaying them  for their financial assets or by lending to  them on the cheap), minimizes their borrowing costs, and lowers their reserve requirements. All of these actions result in immediate handouts to the financial elite first,  with the hope that they will subsequently  unleash  this  fresh  capital  onto  the  unsuspecting markets, raising demand and  prices wherever they do.  The Fed, having gone on an unprecedented  credit expansion spree, has benefited the recipients who were first in line at the trough:  banks (imagine borrowing for free and then  buying up assets that you know the Fed is  aggressively buying with you) and those favored entities and individuals deemed most  creditworthy. Flush with capital, these recipients have proceeded to bid up the prices  of assets and resources, while everyone else  has watched their purchasing power decline.  At some point, of course, the honey flow  stops—but not before much malinvestment.  Such malinvestment  is precisely what we  saw in the historic 1990s equity and subsequent real-estate bubbles (and what we’re  likely seeing again today in overheated credit and equity markets), culminating in painful liquidation. The Fed is transferring immense wealth from the middle class to the  most affluent, from the least privileged to  the most privileged. This coercive redistribution has been a far more egregious source of  disparity than the president’s presumption  of tax unfairness (if there is anything unfair  about approximately half of a population  paying zero income taxes) or deregulation.  Pitting  economic  classes  against  each  other is a divisive tactic that benefits no  one. Yet if there is any upside, it is perhaps  a closer examination of the true causes of  the problem. Before we start down the path  of arguing about the merits of redistributing  wealth to benefit the many, why not first  stop redistributing it to the most privileged?  f  HONORING MEDAL OF HONOR  RECIPIENTS  HON.

This is the second time in four  years  that Hopkins Junior High School has  won the National Science Bowl, sponsored by  the Department of Energy.  Hopkins Junior High owes their success to  team members Karthik Bharathala, Dhruv  Muley, Catherine Zeng, Brian Tseng, Mark  Choi and their teacher Paul Ricks, who practiced  tirelessly  for  this  year ’s  competition.  Clearly, that practice certainly paid off.  In  the National Science Bowl,  judged by  United States Energy Secretary Steven Chu,  five member  teams compete against each  other  in a  fast paced Jeopardy style  format  where teams try to be the first to correctly answer an oral question posed about science or  math. Nearly 14,000 students participated  in  regional  tournaments  and more  than  100  teams competed in the Nationals.  This accomplishment  is evidence of  the  quality of Fremont’s public schools. The dedication of students, teachers and parents has  led to this great success, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them.

This bill, introduced by  Ms. MCMORRIS-RODGERSand Mr. ROSS, has  bipartisan support and will result in more competitive practices in the Pharmaceutical industry. H.R. 4215 will require increased regulation  of Pharmacy Benefit Managers, also known as  PBMs, to ensure that consumers are receiving  the care they deserve at competitive and fair  costs.  Mr. Speaker, within the pharmaceutical industry there is a pressing issue concerning the  lack of  transparency surrounding PBM business practices. We cannot afford  to allow  these businesses to continue as usual in the  pharmaceutical  industry. The recent Express  Scripts and Medco merger means  that  ‘the  big three’ ’ PBMs will now control benefits for  72% of all Americans. I believe this makes it  much more  important  that we act decisively  and pass this legislation.

It supports and complements initiatives already  included  in the National Defense Authorization Act to  improve the efficient use of military  cyber operations that support military  missions and objectives. At the same  time,  I want to be clear what this  amendment does not do. I want to assure those who may have been confused  by the language that it does not authorize the interagency body to manage spectrum resources, whether federal, state, or non-governmental. Nor  does it authorize the interagency body  to impose obligations or other regulations on the private sector. It is based  on research the Government Accountability Office carried out for the committee, and it will improve the ability  of the Department to integrate cyber  effects into its operational planning.

344,House,112,0.644,34,2012-05-18,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman,  for over 60 years, the United States and  Israel have forged a very unique relationship. A friendship built upon trust  and shared sacrifice and common values. But our relations with Israel, as  with a growing number of long-held alliances, seem to be negotiable with this  administration.  A stream of highly sensitive information continues  to be  leaked  to  the  press—information that includes U.S.  and Israeli military and  intelligence  operational  capabilities,  as well  as  classified negotiations between Israel  and other countries.  On March 20, The New York Times,  citing senior administration officials,  reported the conclusions of a classified  war  simulation  conducted  by  the  United States that analyzed an Israeli  attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.  On March 28, Foreign Policy magazine, quoting four senior diplomats and  military intelligence officers, referred  to a report that Israel would be granted access to air bases in Azerbaijan as  part of an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a move clearly designed to undercut cooperation between Azerbaijan  and Israel.  Further degrading Israel’s ability to  defend  itself, The Washington Post’s  David Ignatius on February 3 reported  that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta believes there’s a strong likelihood that Israel will strike Iran  in  April, May, or June, which reportedly  sent Iran’s air defenses on high alert.  The release of this classified information not only puts at risk fragile negotiations between countries but also the  very lives of the men and women called  upon to carry out this mission.  I  recently  traveled  to  the Middle  East, where we met with senior Israeli  officials. Their number one concern  was that for the first time in our long  relationship, United States was releasing classified operational information  and capabilities, willfully putting at  risk the lives of Israeli people.  Mr. Chairman, our actions are not  the actions of a friend or an ally. A  couple of weeks ago, I joined with 22  other Members of the House of Representatives and sent a letter to President Obama calling for an investigation into these leaks by senior administration and intelligence officials. We  have yet to receive a response.  Now it’s no secret that this administration  is seeking to dissuade Israel  from launching an airstrike on Iranian  nuclear  facilities, but risking Israeli  and American lives and undermining  our  alliance  is  unacceptable.  The  Israeli people should not have to question our support for their security.  So I offer this amendment with Representative PAT and Representative  Our  amendment calls for the Attorney General  to  investigate  these  leaks and  bring  those  responsible  to  justice.

In honor of  this momentous milestone, a celebratory reception will be held on May 19, 2012, at The  Senior Center in Michigan City, Indiana. For  100 years, Saint Luke United Lutheran Church  has been committed to providing spiritual guidance as well as charitable contributions to numerous organizations and individuals.  In  1912,  Saint  Luke  English  Lutheran  Church was founded in Michigan City, Indiana,  under Reverend Dobberstein. At the time, the  people living in the area saw the need for an  English-speaking Lutheran Church, so Saint  Luke’s began holding services at  the  local  YMCA, as well as in one of the Sunday school  classrooms at Saint Paul’s Church. In 1915,  the congregation, consisting of twenty families,  witnessed the construction of their first church  building. Later, in 1969, to accommodate the  needs of the growing congregation, the current  church building was erected on Coolspring Avenue  in Michigan City.  In 2002, Lutheran  Church of  the Dunes  joined parishes with  Saint Luke, and the church became the Saint  Luke United Lutheran Church. Today,  the  church has an impressive membership of 112  families.  Saint Luke United Lutheran Church, under  the  leadership of Reverend John Mikenas,  provides much support to charity organizations  and has built an outstanding community outreach program. The congregation has been  dedicated to serving those in need and has focused its charitable efforts in many ways including: assisting soup kitchens throughout the  Michigan City area, organizing a  food and  warm clothing drive  for  the Salvation Army,  and supporting the men’s homeless shelter in  Michigan City. Saint Luke’s has also created a  program for families in need of assistance with  utility and medical bills, as well as another  program  that provides homemade soup and  fruit baskets  to  the homebound.  In addition,  Saint Luke’s is dedicated to the youth of the  community and runs a vacation bible school  during  the summer months. The Saint Luke  Youth Group also participates in mission trips  and assists the elderly in the community.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and  my other distinguished colleagues join me in  honoring  the  congregation  at Saint  Luke  United Lutheran Church  for  its exceptional  community service ministry and  in congratulating the parish on its 100th anniversary. The  great work of this truly admirable congregation  continues to touch the lives of countless individuals, and for their selfless service, the leadership and members at Saint Luke’s are worthy of the highest praise.  f  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013  SPEECHOF  HON.

351,,112,-0.438,69,2012-05-18,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Chair, I offer this bi-  partisan amendment with Congressman JEFF  LANDRY to increase transparency surrounding  the issuance of waivers allowing foreign vessels  to carry cargo between points  in  the  United States. I thank Congressman LANDRY  for his leadership on this issue.  A  report  recently  released  by  PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that in 2006,  the most  recent year  for which data were  available, the Jones Act fleet supported nearly  74,000 direct jobs in the U.S. shipbuilding and  domestic waterborne transportation industries.  These  jobs,  in  turn, supported more  than  $36 billion  in economic output  in 2009 and  provided $6.5 billion in labor compensation.  Among other provisions, the Jones Act requires  that a vessel cannot carry cargo between two U.S. points unless the vessel has  been built in the United States, and is owned  and crewed by Americans.  LANDRY The Jones Act can be waived in the interest  of national defense. However,  the Maritime  Administration  (MARAD) must  first  assess  whether Jones Act-qualified vessels are available to carry the cargo under consideration.  Following the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2011, the Department of Homeland Security waived the Jones  Act dozens of times despite the availability of  Jones Act-qualified vessels.  According  to documents provided by  the  Department of Transportation, waivers were  issued at the request of firms such as Shell  Oil Company, ConocoPhillips Company, and  BP Products North America.  As a result, the American oil released from  the American Strategic Petroleum Reserve  was then carried by vessels flagged in such  countries as Liberia,  the Marshall  Islands,  Singapore, the Bahamas, and Panama.  The amendment I offer with Congressman  is a simple one. Let me be clear:  though I think waivers should be issued only  in  the  rarest of circumstances,  this amendment does not prohibit  the  issuance of any  waivers.  Instead,  it would require  the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to include in its assessments of the availability of Jones Act-compliant vessels  information on  the actions  that  could be taken to enable Jones Act-qualified  vessels to carry the cargo for which a waiver  is sought.  MARAD would also be required to publish  its assessments on  its website and provide  notification to Congress when a waiver is requested or issued.  Adoption of these provisions will significantly  enhance  the  transparency  surrounding  the  issuance of Jones Act waivers so that we can  assess whether every possible opportunity to  utilize  Jones Act-compliant  vessels  in  the  coastwise trade has been utilized.  I urge Members on both sides of the aisle  to support our bi-partisan amendment to ensure that every available step is taken to utilize American mariners to carry American cargoes on American ships between American  ports.  f  KIPP BALTIMORE’S BRAD NORNHOLD WINS  BALTIMORE  CITY  ‘‘TEACHER OF THE YEAR’’  HON.

353,,112,-0.386,76,2012-05-18,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce  legislation, with my  colleagues Representatives CHARLESGONZALEZand MICHAEL  HONDA, which would help eliminate uncertainty  for military and overseas voters when they request an absentee ballot this year that they  will get ballots for each of the elections for the  full year when voting absentee.  The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act of 2009 repealed several  subsections of Section 104 of the Uniformed  and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act  (UOCAVA), which has caused concern among  overseas voting groups that this change may  result in a situation in which a military or overseas voter might vote in a primary election but  not  receive ballots  for  the general election.  This  legislation would amend UOCAVA  to  make clarifications to the law and ensure that  voters who request an absentee ballot will receive ballots for each election that occurs during the full election cycle.  The MOVE Act was a major step forward in  the  reform and modernization of UOCAVA;  however, this particular change may have unintended consequences. As we are  in  the  2012 election cycle, we need to ensure that  this  does  not  inadvertently  disenfranchise  large swaths of our military and overseas voters. This bill proposes simple  fixes  that will  help ensure  the  votes of every overseas  American are counted.  f  LAWRENCE SALAZAR  HON.

354,,112,-0.426,76,2012-05-18,Ms. PINGREE of Maine.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to highlight the outstanding accomplishments of a group of students in my district.  For  the  last 8 years,  the Windplanners of  Camden Hills Regional High School have endeavored to bring a full-size wind turbine to  their school. What started out as a vision has  now become a reality. After conducting feasibility studies, earning the support of their community, raising a half-million dollars, and clearing bureaucratic hurdles, the students erected  a 155-foot turbine at their school this spring.  In the first week of operation alone, the turbine generated enough electricity to power six  households for a month. Over the years, this  project will save their school thousands of dollars, keep hundreds of tons of carbon emissions out of the air, and stand as a tribute to  what a committed group can do—whatever  their age may be.  I’m very proud of  these students and  the  teachers and community members who have  supported them. They have learned real-world  lessons that will serve them well—and have  taught us all some  important  lessons  in  the  process.  f  RECOGNIZING  FOND  DU  LAC  SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR 21ST CENTURY READINESS  HON.

355,,112,0.379,76,2012-05-18,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker,  in order  for our  students to be competitive in the global economy, we must do our part to ensure that they  are acquiring  the knowledge and skills  they  need for success. The skills needed for success go beyond the basics of reading, writing,  and math, however. When surveyed, employers continually emphasize  that,  in our 21st  century economy, students need to be adept  at critical thinking and problem solving; communication; collaboration; and creativity and  innovation,  in addition  to being proficient  in  core subjects.  While it’s important to talk about these skills,  it’s even more important to see and recognize  where  they  are  being  successfully  incorporated  into educational curriculums at  the  local  level. Fond du Lac School District,  located in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, in my congressional district, is doing a lot of innovative  work to prepare its students for success in the  21st century economy. Along with officials  from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and the Partnership for 21st Century  Skills,  I  recently visited  the Fond du Lac  School District to learn about their efforts firsthand.  The Fond du Lac School District,  through  the  leadership of Superintendent Dr. James  Sebert and John Whitsett, the School District’s  Coordinator of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment,  rewrote  the  school’s entire  curriculum in 2005 to fully incorporate 21st century skills. This fall, all students will be given  Google Chromebooks to help further integrate  technology into their education. Also this fall,  the Fond du Lac Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Academy  will open  to many 3rd  through 5th graders  through  lead  teacher Sarah Edbauer. The  STEM Academy will focus not only on a rigorous STEM curriculum, but it will also place  a heavy emphasis on project-based and student-led  learning as a method  for  teaching  21st century skills.  The STEM Academy in Fond du Lac is a  good example of how community partnerships  can broaden students’ educational experience.  Mercury Marine, based in Fond du Lac, is a  world  leader  in marine propulsion and  technology and a major manufacturer of outboard  motors and  inboard engines. The company  has partnered  in  the development of  the  school’s STEM Academy because of difficulties it has experienced finding qualified applicants to meet its workforce needs. The company conveyed, as have numerous other employers, that the nature of manufacturing jobs  is changing and  that successful employees  need to be creative, need to be able to problem solve, and need to be able to work collaboratively with other  coworkers, amongst  other skills. Through  the company’s partnership with the Fond du Lac STEM Academy, it  is hoping to grow a local workforce by getting  students  engaged  in  practical,  real-world  projects that will help them develop the skills  they need to be successful when they enter  the workforce.  It’s  important  that Congress recognize  the  work  that  is being done  in communities  like  Fond du Lac and that we look for ways to support  these efforts. For  these  reasons, Rep.  DAVELOEBSACKand I recently formed the bipartisan Congressional 21st Century Skills  Caucus to inform and discuss better ways to  promote 21st century skills in our nation ’s educational system. I invite all of my colleagues to  join our efforts.  f  HONORING MR. LLOYD HAND AND  MRS. ANN HAND  HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 18, 2012  ",2012

It has  been such a pleasure to know and work with  Mr. Moore as he has helped address critical  water resources and infrastructure needs for  this nation during his career. Overall, he has  served his country as a young soldier and as  a distinguished civilian senior  leader  for  the  Los Angeles District spanning a career of over  44 years.  Mr. Moore’s technical expertise and superior  leadership has been instrumental to the success of the Army Corps of Engineers’ many  complex projects and programs. As the Army  Corps of Engineers  transformed  itself  to a  project management focused organization, he  was called to lead the role as one of the first  Deputy District Engineers for Project Management and  is  retiring as  the  longest serving  Corps leader in that role. He has been instrumental in the success of the extremely capable Los Angeles District which has nearly 400  projects  in navigation,  flood control, environmental  restoration, military construction, and  environmental  cleanup.  He  has  led  and  mentored  future  engineering  leaders  supporting our country’s critical infrastructure including young military officers who have been  assigned to the Los Angeles District.  He has been equally adept at  interacting  with all levels of government partners, agencies,  stakeholders, and public  sponsors  in  meeting the nation ’s military construction and  water resources needs. The organization and  teams that he has led have been known for  their intricate problem solving, common sense  solutions, consideration of stakeholder needs,  and  teamwork. All  in all,  I know of no  finer  member of our esteemed United States Army  Corps of Engineers and I wish him the best in  the years ahead.  IN RECOGNITION OF GREGORY  CHRISTIANSEN  HON. DENNIS A.

357,,112,0.602,6,2012-05-25,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pride that I recognize Paige Stinnett, of  the Carroll Senior High School choir, for being  selected for the Texas Music Educators Association’s All-State Women’s Choir.  Every year 60,000 high school musicians in  Texas  compete  for  the opportunity  to be  among the 1,500 chosen for various All-State  ensembles. Choir singers first audition before  judges in one of twenty-eight Regions, and the  highest ranked musicians  from each Region  then participate in one of seven Area competitions. The best among the Area singers then  go on  to  the annual clinic and convention  hosted by the Texas Music Educators Association, TMEA. The clinical consists of three  days of rehearsal with prestigious musical experts and culminates in a grand All-State performance.  Being selected for one of the three All-State  choirs (Men’s, Women ’s, or Mixed) is indeed a  high honor for any high school choir member  and is a testament to their hard work, talent,  and dedication. That makes it all the more impressive that Paige Stinnett, who is a soprano,  not only made it to the 2012 Women’s Choir,  but also achieved  the same honor  in 2011.  Her success is truly remarkable. I would also  like  to  recognize  the valuable contributions  made by Chris Hutchinson, the Carroll Senior  High School choir director, whose commitment  to his school’s musical program has shown  brilliantly through his students.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 24th Congressional District of Texas,  I ask all my distinguished colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating Paige Stinnett on being chosen for the  TMEA All-State Women ’s Choir.  f  HONORING VINCE HARRIS  HON.

As mentioned by the chairman and  the ranking member, this bill probably  wouldn’t necessarily be passed  if  it  wasn’t because of the conflict we had  between  the State when we passed  statehood, the Native Land Claims Act  and, of course, the BLM. There is no  one that objects to this bill. It solves a  very important problem for the local  people and the subsistence-style living.  It also takes care of the recreational  areas that they can be utilizing. And  it’s the right bill to do for the State of  Alaska and Alaska natives.  Mr. Speaker, I’d like to speak on another  subject  for  a  short moment  which I believe relates to this. For the  people listening to this great display of  legislative action on the House floor,  we’d like to remind them, you know,  Little Red Riding Hood, do not go to  sleep.  Just because the prices of gas have  been dropping at the pumps, do not be  lured into the idea that everything’s  going to be okay, because I’ve watched  this now in my 40 years here go up and  down, up and down; and every time we  start to do something, start moving  forward for self-dependency on our fossil fuels, those that are providing us  the fuel from overseas at cost of great  bloodshed and a flood of dollars, they  take and drop their prices. When doing  so, we  start getting  lulled back  to  sleep, and we don’t do anything. And  then they’ll jack the prices up again,  and the whole economy will not recover.  So I’m asking the public to understand one thing: do not go to sleep.  Just because you go up to the pump  station now and put that nozzle in and  say, oh, my, gas is only $3.60 when it  was $4.15, headed to $5. Watch it very  closely, ladies and gentlemen. Watch  this, everybody on the  floor of this  House, because you are going to sleep.  Oh, everything’s fine and dandy. We  do not have to worry about this anymore.

389,Senate,112,-0.203,89,2012-06-05,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  let  me begin by acknowledging the leadership of the Senator from Maryland and  the other Senators who have come to  the floor this morning to speak on behalf of a bill whose time has come and,  some might say, a bill whose time has  passed. It has been almost 50 years  since the original gender equity in the  workplace bill was passed, and it has  not been modernized in over five decades. So, in large measure, this is really a bill whose time has come, and we  hope to make that law happen in the  next  few weeks. With  support  from  both Democrats and Republicans and  by putting common sense and heart  and  compassion  and  good  business  sense, might  I  say, before political  talking points, this, in fact, could be  done.  The reason this bill is so important is  because 50 years ago women were not  major breadwinners in families. As the  Presiding Officer knows, there was tremendous hiring discrimination against  women and minorities. Happily, that  seems to be passing and fading. There  are women now at the highest ranks of  corporate  America. We  have  had  women serving in the highest positions  here in Washington, DC, and around  our country. While there still is a gap  that can be recognized both in the private and public sector, the ability for  women, with the right credentials and  the right background, to get hired is  easier today and  is happening more  than ever before.  The problem is that when we look at  the wage gap, unfortunately, it still  persists. With women now in many instances being the major breadwinners  in their families, this is really a family  issue. It is paying some families much  less than others based on the fact that  there is a woman as the breadwinner  instead of a man. That is hurting families throughout America. It is not fair,  and it should not be tolerated. That is  why this bill, introduced by Senator  MIKULSKIand cosponsored by many of  us, is important.  Wage discrimination is against the  law and it has been for 50 years, but the  consequences and the actions individuals can take if they feel as though  they are being discriminated against  are, in effect, different and not where  they need to be. So this law updates  the Equal Pay Act that was passed in  1963 to basically put the final nail in  the coffin of wage discrimination.  In 1967 women only earned 58 cents to  every dollar a man earned in an equal—  in an exact—position. That was grossly  unfair, but it is still unfair today that  women in the same job are still making  only 77 cents for every dollar a man  earns. It is not right, and it must be  corrected. We can correct it by passing  this law that gives people who believe  they are being discriminated against  better access to the court and, might I  say, it also gives businesses that potentially are the ones being sued—even  small companies or large companies—  more protections in this bill than other  businesses have in similar discrimination cases. In other words,  frivolous  lawsuits will not be allowed, and if a  case is not strong, there is a screen  that is tighter in this bill than in other  pieces of legislation.  I realize there  is some opposition  from the business community that contends that this bill will simply usher in  more controversy or more courtroom  time. But the fact is that is exactly the  way our system was created. Congress  passes laws and enforces equal pay for  equal work. If people feel as though  they are not being treated fairly under  the law, they are supposed to try to  modify that behavior out of court, and  if they can’t, then we ask them—we, in  fact, want them—to go to court to try  to get it settled. That is the American  system. We don’t want people to overuse courts or to abuse courts, but we  most certainly want people who feel as  though they are not being treated fairly under the law to have access to a  court system.  Might I say that despite the fact that  our court system  is regularly criticized, I would much prefer to show up  in a court here than in Iraq or in Egypt  or  in Afghanistan or even  in  some  places  in Europe or most certainly  some countries in Africa. America has  a very transparent, fairly sophisticated  and modern judiciary system, and it  really is a model for the world.  Sometimes I think we overlitigate in  some areas, but where are these women  supposed to go? What are they supposed to do—have an appointment with  their Congressman, show the Congressman their paycheck? No. Congressmen  don’t do that. Judges do. And when  they get their day in court, they can  show their pay stubs, and they can  then demonstrate that they have been  doing the same job as the man next  door but they have been getting paid 77  cents on the man’s dollar. That is why  this bill is important.  I don’t know for the life of me why  the chamber of commerce is opposed. I  think there are a lot of women in the  chamber of commerce as business owners and as women who used to work for  other businesses before  they owned  their own.  I had hoped they would  stand and  speak  for women  everywhere, that when a woman shows up  early in the morning and works until  late at night, they deserve to be paid  the same as a man doing that exact  job.  According to the American Bar Association, in the 50 years since its passage, the Equal Pay Act has become  outdated,  ineffective, and wage discrimination remains persistent, widespread and pernicious.

390,Senate,112,-0.25,110,2012-06-05,Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.," Mr.  President, today I wish to pay tribute  to my alma mater, the University of  South Dakota, on their 150th anniversary. Throughout its history, USD has  been a shining example of excellence in  education, research, and service. USD  consistently  produces  extraordinary  graduates, prepared  for the complex  challenges of modern-day society.  Founded in 1862 in Vermillion, USD  has the distinction of being South Dakota’s  oldest  university.  Since  its  founding, the campus has grown from  one building to 63, serving a student  population of nearly 10,000. USD offers  a complete range of undergraduate and  graduate programs of study, as well as  the only schools of law and medicine in  South Dakota.  Students  are well-  served by USD’s liberal arts tradition,  which  encourages  interdisciplinary  study. This produces adaptable, well-  rounded graduates, prepared  for  the  ever-changing world.  USD  students have  been  awarded  some of the most prestigious honors in  academia including Rhodes, Fulbright,  Truman, Udall, and Goldwater Scholarships. Graduate and undergraduate students  frequently  collaborate one-on-  one with USD’s dedicated faculty to  conduct research. This high degree of  collaboration is enabled by the university’s 15–1 student-faculty ratio.  Athletics are an important part of  university life, and USD is no exception. The  iconic DakotaDome  is the  cornerstone of USD Coyote athletics.  This multipurpose 145,000 square foot  structure has brought fans and athletes  together for more than 30 years. The  Coyotes have made the jump to division I, bringing increased exposure and  a higher level of competition to the  athletic program.  It is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to honor the University of  South Dakota for 150 years of academic  success. USD is a family tradition; it is  where I met my wife, Barbara, and  when it was time for our three children  to attend college they all chose USD.  The world-class education I received at  USD gave me  skills and knowledge  that serve me well to this today. I congratulate my good  friend, President  Jim Abbott, and the entire USD community on this milestone in the rich  history of the university. As an alumnus, I would be remiss if I didn’t close  my statement with, ‘‘Go Yotes!’’∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  ROYAL ROSARIANS  ∑",2012
391,,112,-0.514,124,2012-06-05,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize a great force in the education of our  children,  Israel Soto, principal of PS/MS 57.  He is retiring after a long career in public service. Mr. Soto got his start in education teaching  in Washington Heights,  in my congressional district. As a Puerto Rican immigrant,  he has taken an active role in bilingual education, having served as a school Bilingual  Coordinator and Assistant Director of Bilingual  Education.  In 1999, Mr. Soto ascended to principal of  PS/MS 57, a pre-K–8 school in East Harlem.  Last year, 67 percent of enrollees were Hispanic or Latino. Mr. Soto’s expertise in bilingual education and  the  fact  that his second  language was English,  like many  of  the  school ’s students, made him an ideal choice  for principal. His talents extend to all facets of  education, however. Under his leadership, PS/  MS 57 has gone from a near-failing school to  one that received a grade of ‘ ‘A’ ’ in its latest  Progress Report and  is  ranked  in  the 93rd  percentile of all New York City K–8 schools.  Mr. Soto has deservedly received numerous  awards during his tenure as principal. In 2001,  he was named ‘ ‘Principal of the Month’ ’ in his  school district and in 2004 was recognized as  the ‘ ‘Educator of the Week’ ’ by Channel 41.  He has also been inducted into the ‘ ‘Calm Fellows Program for Distinguished Principals’ ’ at  Columbia University as well as being honored  by Children 4 Children,  the YMCA of New  York,  the New York Post and El Diario La  Prensa.  Mr. Soto’s work at PS/MS 57 serves as a  model  for current and  future educators. He  has built strong partnerships with  teachers,  parents, community organizations and the private sector while keeping his  focus  internal,  on his students. This outreach has significantly  increased the academic resources available to  his students and demonstrates  the supreme  importance of an active and charismatic principal such as Mr. Soto.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that you and my colleagues join me in honoring a great man and  an impassioned educator who, first and foremost, believes in all of our extraordinary children.  f  MELANIE KURTZ  HON. ED PERLMUTTER  OFCOLORADO  good of all members of our community. The  technical correction I offer here today would  allow organizations in the Northern Marianas  and other U.S. territories an equal opportunity  to apply for federal funds to increase the effectiveness of nonprofits and to expand their  impact within their communities.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and  allow the U.S. territories an equal opportunity  to compete for this program.  f  FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION  REFORM ACT OF 2012  SPEECHOF  HON. CLIFF STEARNS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 5, 2012  ",2012
392,,112,0.554,124,2012-06-05,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, the Food and  Drug Administration Reform Act, H.R. 5651, is  based on user fee negotiations between FDA  and the prescription drug, generic drug, biologic, and medical device industry. This reauthorization of the FDA user fees will provide  stability with FDA’s new product  review as  companies submit new and innovative devices  and drugs for approval.  In codifying the User Fee Agreement, this  committee has  included additional provisions  designed to address some of the defects of  the regulatory structure and overreach by the  FDA. Under my Chairmanship of the Oversight  and  Investigation Subcommittee, we held a  hearing  into FDA’s  regulatory efforts  in  the  medical device space. During our hearing,  many of the witnesses talked about the reluctance of FDA  to approve devices and how  FDA continually moved the goalposts for approval. I am glad that Title VII of this bill includes a significant number of reform provisions designed to bring certainty to the medical device field.  In addition to reforming approaches to medical devices through Title VII, the FDA’s approach to rare diseases must also be modernized.  I’m happy  the Committee  included  the  Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act,  FAST Act, H.R. 4132, which I introduced with  my  friend and colleague, Representative ED  TOWNS. FAST updates and modernizes Section 506 of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act,  and updates the Accelerated Approval statute  to  reflect  two  decades worth  of medical  sciences that has occurred since Accelerated  Approval was  first created. FAST will help  FDA implement broadly effective processes for  the expedited development and review of innovative new medicines intended to address  unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases by using modern  scientific  tools.  The use of surrogate endpoints may result  in fewer, smaller or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA’s existing high standards for safety or efficacy. Surrogate and clinical endpoints only need to be reasonable predictors of clinical benefit  to support accelerated approval. They do not need to be validated or proven first. The changes made to  current law permitting the Secretary to require  validation of surrogates following accelerated  approval is not intended to change FDA’s long  history of granting accelerated approval based  on  unvalidated,  but  predictive,  surrogate  endpoints.

This past weekend, the  South Stanly Rowdy Rebel Bulls baseball and  softball programs finished their seasons with  each team capturing its second North Carolina  1–A State Championship, handily winning their  championship games held  this weekend  in  Durham and Raleigh, respectively. With their  combined victories, South Stanly High School  became just the third program in the history of  North Carolina baseball and fast-pitch softball  to sweep both titles in the same season.  The South Stanly baseball team finished the  2012 season with a 30–4 record, capping the  season with a 6–1 victory over Voyager Academy in the State Championship game. I congratulate head coach Terry Tucker, who, in his  fourth year with the program, has led the team  to  its  third state championship appearance  and  its  second  state  championship  since  2009.  The South Stanly softball team finished the  2012 season with a 27–7 record, completing  the season with a 9–2 win over Camden to  win the state title. I congratulate South Stanly  softball head coach David Poplin, who led the  team to its second title since 1998.  Most  importantly,  sincere  congratulations  are due  to  the dedicated young men and  women of these two teams. Their hard work  and sacrifice throughout the season put them  on  the road  to championships, and  together  their dedication and  focus has brought  two  more state titles back to Norwood.  Folks  throughout our community have always had a way of banding together in support of one another, and this year’s baseball  and softball seasons showed a perfect example of  that at South Stanly. From dedicated  parents and siblings,  to  friends and church  members, our community came out  in  full  force to cheer the Rowdy Rebel Bulls on to  victory. I’m honored to represent the people of  Stanly County, the players and their dedicated  families, and the coaches and faculty of the  school.  Before Congress and our great nation, I am  proud  to  recognize  the members of South  Stanly High School’s baseball and softball  teams, Coach Tucker and Coach Poplin, Principal Mike Campbell, Athletic Director Sean  Whitley and the entire Stanly County community as a whole for another local championship  season.

394,,112,0.371,131,2012-06-05,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  salute  the dedication of  the administration,  staff and students of Greenville Elementary  School in Greenville, Illinois, who went above  and beyond in caring for, and ultimately saving  the life of, one of the school’s kindergarteners.  Emma Young started kindergarten at Greenville Elementary  this year, but Emma  is not  your  typical kindergartener. Since she was  very young, Emma suffered seizures and unconsciousness due to a condition that doctors  were unable to diagnose due to a lack of data.  Finally, doctors placed an implantable loop recorder in Emma’s chest to collect data for up  to three years in the hopes of collecting the information necessary to diagnose Emma’s condition.  Emma’s parents met with the school nurse  to ensure that school staff were aware of her  condition and knew what to do. But instead of  just  filing  the  information away, school staff  made a superior effort to inform everyone involved with Emma ’s daily activities  in  the  event that their help was needed in an emergency. The school nurse, Emma’s  teacher,  and all the faculty and staff who had contact  with Emma on a daily basis had a special  meeting after school  to  learn about Emma’s  condition and about the monitor implanted in  her chest. Her teacher made posters with her  picture and a photo of the device, with step-  by-step instructions for staff or substitutes to  review. The staff even developed a plan called  ‘Code  Emma’ ’,  and  taught  the  other  kindergarteners how to recognize when Emma  needed help and how  to announce a Code  Emma.  This spring, Emma’s mother, Jill, was at  home when she  received a breathless call  from  the school secretary  informing her  that  Emma had suffered a seizure. She rushed to  the school, where an ambulance had already  arrived to take Emma to the hospital. Riding to  the hospital, Jill was grateful for the fast response by  the school staff, but wondered  if  the staff had remembered to press the button  on Emma ’s device so that the data could be  collected, and a diagnosis finally determined.  Emma’s condition returned to normal over the  next few minutes, and she was released from  the hospital that day. An hour later, Emma ’s  cardiologist called and told Jill that the data  had been collected, and Emma’s condition  could finally be diagnosed and treated. Emma  now has a pacemaker and  is receiving  life-  saving  treatment,  thanks  to  the doctors and  nurses who worked with her, but perhaps  most importantly, due to the students and staff  at Greenville Elementary who called out and  responded to the Code Emma.  Emma’s mother writes that the students and  staff at Greenville Elementary are deserving of  recognition for their ‘ ‘commitment to education,  and  their dedication  to nurturing and  loving  children  in  the community. The  lessons  that  are taught inside of the walls at Greenville Elementary are not just the mandated ones, but  the ones that will mold these children into the  types of individuals they will become.’ ’  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity  to salute the entire team at Greenville Elementary for the good work they do in educating  children in not just the Three Rs, but in caring  for others and being good citizens. I am proud  to represent such an outstanding community  and such outstanding people.  ETIENNE CHARLES  HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 5, 2012  ",2012

Mr. Freiberg is retiring  from USTR after more than 24 years of  extraordinary service to our country.  Since 1988, Ken Freiberg has passionately  promoted US  trade  interests  around the world. His service has improved the lives of countless Americans. During his tenure, Ken served as  the chief U.S. lawyer in charge of negotiations on several important trade negotiations. Further, he was the chief  negotiator for the General Agreement  on Trade in Services during the Uruguay Round.  Ken has worked under  eight US  Trade Representatives and five Presidential  administrations. Ambassador  Kirk and several  former U.S. Trade  Representatives, including myself, recently sent Ken a letter to recognize  his achievements. Let me read an excerpt and I quote ‘‘each of us benefited  greatly from your tireless work ethic,  immense knowledge, wise counsel and  excellent judgment.’’ I was proud to  have Ken on my team at USTR. He was  a source of tremendous  institutional  knowledge at USTR, and was a terrific  mentor to many young attorneys on  the USTR staff.  Mr. President, I would like to recognize Ken Freiberg, my  former  colleague, on his retirement from public  service and I would like to wish him  well in all of his future endeavors.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ANTONIO POMERLEAU  ∑",2012
396,Senate,112,-0.517,25,2012-06-11,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, today  I wish to celebrate Antonio Pomerleau  of Burlington, VT, for his remarkable  generosity and for his lifetime of service to the people of Vermont. My wife  Jane and I have known Tony for over 30  years, since we all worked together  when I was Mayor of Burlington, and  he  is clearly one of the remarkable  people in our State.  Last year, Vermont was badly hit by  Tropical Storm Irene, the most damaging storm  in a half century. Torrential  rains,  in  combination with  Vermont’s steep hills and narrow valleys, brought flooding on a vast scale  to town after town, wiping out roads  and bridges, downtowns and mobile  home parks, homes, schools and businesses.  Many  brave  and  generous  people,  from communities across  the State,  helped those whose lives were uprooted  to deal with their losses. The Vermont  National Guard, along with the Guards  of other States and private contractors,  rapidly  repaired  and  rebuilt  washed-out roads and bridges. State officials and Federal officials were quick  to provide relief and aid.  There are Federal funds available to  help rebuild highways, to assist farmers as they cope with damage to their  fields, to help many homeowners. But,  as the Governor’s ‘‘Irene Recovery Report’’ indicates, mobile home owners  are in a category by themselves. Irene  particularly devastated mobile home  parks, many of which were built close  to rivers that endured major flooding.  Sixteen mobile home parks in many regions of Vermont were seriously affected by Irene. Hundreds of mobile  homes were badly damaged or completely destroyed. As the ‘‘Irene Recovery Report’’ made clear, while mobile  homes provide an important affordable  ownership option to Vermonters, their  construction, location and low resistance to water damage can create additional obstacles to recovery following a  disaster. Few of the Vermonters affected had significant discretionary resources with which to secure replacement housing.  Owners  and  residents  of mobile  homes faced enormous challenges. Into  the breach stepped Antonio Pomerleau.  Tony, who grew up on a small dairy  farm  in  the Northeast Kingdom of  Vermont,  has  never  forgotten  the  working families of Vermont. It should  be no surprise, though it is nevertheless remarkable, that in the aftermath  of the flooding last year Tony would  generously look out for those who live  in affordable housing and cannot afford  to rebuild when catastrophe strikes.  Today, I want celebrate Tony for his  act of enormous generosity in creating  the Pomerleau Cornerstone Fund and  giving it $1 million. This fund has one  purpose: to provide direct funding to  residents of mobile homes whose residences were  destroyed  by Tropical  Storm Irene.  The Pomerleau Cornerstone Fund  will help displaced mobile residents either with  full  replacement of  their  homes, or with downpayment assistance for another home. It will provide  grants up to $25,000 so that at least 40  families can move into safe and affordable housing.  Throughout  his  entire  adult  life,  Tony has been a model of what a good  corporate citizen  should be. He has  been an excellent employer, and he has  devoted a good part of his life and considerable skills toward public service—  without remuneration. For many years  he served as Police Commissioner of  Burlington and did an outstanding job  in  that  role. He has also been extremely generous in donating funds to  a wide variety of very worthy causes.  Since I was Mayor of Burlington, and  this  is  going  back  31 years, Tony  Pomerleau has paid for a holiday party  each year for Burlington’s low income  children and  their parents. He also  sponsors  an  annual  party  for  the  Vermont National Guard. He was the  major  contributor  of  funds  to  the  Pomerleau Alumni Center at St. Michael’s College—two of his sons and a  granddaughter attended college there.  He has provided scholarships to Rice  High School and funded renovations to  Christ the King School. Tony donated  the North Avenue building that became  our city’s police headquarters, and continues to contribute financial support  for policemen and policewomen. And  this really is just a very small part of  Tony’s philanthropic work.  But facts tell only part of the story  of Tony Pomerleau. His generosity is  matched  by  his  energy,  and  even  though his 94th birthday is in his rearview mirror, he has the energy of a  man half his age. His mind has always  been sharp, and time has not dulled it.  His deep  love  for his wife Rita and  their children is the rock on which he  has built his life.

397,House,112,0.498,12,2012-06-20,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Madam  Speaker, this act removes the obstacles  that are blocking our efforts to achieve  greater American energy production  and job creation by providing more certainty and clarity to the public lands  leasing and permitting process.  In particular, my part of this legislation will ensure that Federal oil and  natural gas lease sales occur on a consistent basis and provide the necessary  lease certainty so production is made  easier.  b1330  Currently,  there are  roughly  1,631  outstanding projects on Federal lands,  including  lands  in Colorado, which  have been delayed over 3 years. Federal  regulatory delays to these projects prevent the creation of over 60,000 jobs.  We have endured  several years of  over 8 percent unemployment. Over 12  percent  of  our  veterans who  have  served in Iraq and Afghanistan are still  out of work. The fact that we are not  fully benefiting from the employment  and financial potential of our energy  resources is simply wrong.  The President often boasts about his  energy record, but this administration  regularly delays and blocks leases. In  fact, BLM only approved 11 oil and gas  leases  in Colorado  in 2011 where,  in  2006, there were 363 approvals.  We in Colorado understand the importance of harnessing our own  resources and the value it provides our  economy. The oil and gas industry in  Colorado directly employs 50,000 people  and supports over 190,000 jobs in our  State. This industry is responsible for  roughly 6 percent of total employment  in Colorado. We have an opportunity  with this legislation to create jobs by  developing  our  own  resources  right  here at home.  Opponents of domestic energy exploration claim that the industry already  has thousands of acres but are not producing the wells.

Gary,  Ph.D.,  LICSW, on the occasion of his retirement as  a full professor from Howard University School  of Social Work.  Dr. Gary has enjoyed a  long and distinguished career as a scholar, researcher, educator, author, administrator, and clinical counselor spanning more than half a century. He is  recognized as one of the nation ’s preeminent  scholars on the impact of mental health issues  on African American males and African American families. Dr. Gary received his Bachelor  of Science degree with high honors  from  Tuskegee University and earned his Master of  Public Administration degree, Master of Social  Work degree, and Ph.D. from the University of  Michigan. Dr. Gary has received appointments  at the School of Social Work at the University  of Michigan and Howard University School of  Social Work and was the Samuel S. Wurtzel  Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Social Work.  Dr. Gary has received funding for research  totaling more  than $8 million, authored and  published hundreds of scholarly articles and  papers, and has presented lectures at more  than 50 universities and colleges  throughout  the United States and in South Africa. He has  provided consultation to scores of public and  private entities in the areas of mental health  and substance abuse.  Dr. Gary is a devout Christian and has been  a devoted member of the Saint Paul African  Methodist Church  in Washington, DC where  he has provided exemplary  leadership as a  servant leader on the Board of Trustees and  the Steward Board for several decades.

Just one comment. We’re moving forward. We’re going to have jobs. We’ve  done the right thing. It’s a good first  step. We’ve got more to do, as was just  said. Everybody gives up something.  We’ve got this control box, if you  want to call it, the black box; the recorder that’s going to be in all trucks.  The Mexican trucks get theirs paid for.  This happens  to be a commercial  driver’s  license.  I  don’t know how  many of you have got one, but if you  want to see one, come look at it sometime. It’s a  little doing to get one.  Owner-operators have to pay for their  own. They’re making $50,000, $60,000 a  year if they’re doing a good operation.  That’s  prevalent  in  trucks  running  across this country. They’re doing a  good  job. They’re keeping commerce  moving. We ought to just keep in mind  we ought to give those middle class,  hardworking, patriotic Americans the  consideration they deserve.  But I’m glad we got the bill. I will go  out there and work with all of you to  try to get it better and get more done,  but we’ve got a good first step.  ",2012
404,House,112,0.598,40,2012-06-29,Mr. GOHMERT.," It’s always an honor  to speak before the House of Representatives, a great storied history here,  just as the Supreme Court has a great  storied history. There’s some moments  in  time with  regard  to  the United  States Supreme Court which show it to  have consisted of a bastion of strong-  willed,  determined,  principled,  constitutionally minded Justices. There  are other  times when  the Supreme  Court has shown itself to consist of  some great judges and some who are  more interested in politics, more interested in feathering their friends’ nests  than they are in doing what was right  under the Constitution, even though it  was easy enough for them to rationalize that, gee, if they did what helped  their  friends,  then  obviously  that  would make  it better  for the whole  country.  I think we get some of that rationalization from this administration. Gee,  if they just throw billions or hundreds  of billions of dollars at friends, then  their friends will do better. And if their  friends are doing better, surely the rest  of the country would. We have also  found that to be true with regard to  things like Solyndra and the massive  number of other cronies of the administration that have received hundreds of  billions of dollars over time and also at  a time when this country  is sorely  hurting from overspending and running  up debt.  In fact, today we had a bill regarding  transportation and a conference report.  I know my friend JOHNMICAfrom Florida worked exceedingly hard, as had  other members of Transportation, trying to reach an agreement with the  conference report. It looked like the  Senate got the better end of the deal.  But I know these people, I know their  hearts, and I know they try to do what  is right for America when it comes to  Chairman MICAand those who are assisting him.  But,  nonetheless,  we  heard  our  friends across the aisle over and over  today talk about how critically important infrastructure is, how we ought to  be spending money, and how just $1 billion added to the transportation budget  could really make a tremendous difference. I hearken back to a year-and-  a-half ago when the President of the  United States, Barack Obama, had told  people that if you will give me basically a trillion—whether it’s $800 billion, $900 billion, apparently it looked  more like a trillion dollars by the time  it was finished—you just hand me over  a trillion bucks and we’ll get this economy going. If you don’t give it to me,  then it will turn out that we may see  as high as 8.5 percent unemployment.  But if you do give it to me, we’ll never  see 8.  Of course, he was wrong  that we  would never see 8 percent unemployment. We’ve gone for many months—I  guess that was 31⁄2years ago now—that  he was telling us about his big stimulus. How quickly time flies.  As  the  transportation  proponents  were pushing their bill today and talking about what the good infrastructure  will do, many of us believed that was  true back in January of 2009, that it  would be good. If we’re going to spend  money on anything, spend it on the  things  that we  really need  to  do:  bridges, roads, all these things that  need construction, need renovation.  So the President sold America largely on his stimulus because we’re going  to fix all the infrastructure in America. But the last 31⁄2years have borne  out that the President did not spend  $800 billion, $900 billion on infrastructure. He spent maybe 6 percent of the  largest giveaway in American history.  He surpassed the terrible mistake that  TARP  was—$700  billion.  And  we  haven’t been able to get an exact number, but of the $700 billion, it may be  $450 billion-or-so that his administration inherited. So when you get the  $800 billion, $900 billion, trillion-dollar  stimulus giveaway—porkulus, as some  called it—and you combine that with  $400 billion, $450 billion, $500 billion  that he was able to inherit from the  TARP fund, you think maybe a trillion  and a trillion-and-a-half dollars he had  to give away.  And we hear debate over what difference $1 billion would make. He was  talking about a thousand times that  for infrastructure. And he spent a tiny  fraction on  infrastructure, preferring  instead to have massive grants and  giveaways to programs that were his  cronies, his pets, that are now producing no dividends and in fact are increasing further debt.  So we hear those things, how wonderful infrastructure would be, and yet we  know when we as a Congress provided  this  administration  with  massive  amounts of money for infrastructure,  they diverted it. They did more damage  to the country than they did good. And  we look at the people that this President has surrounded himself with. He  had a Solicitor General named Elena  Kagan. The Solicitor General’s job is to  assist the White House, assist the administration with potential legislation  that may come to  litigation, assist  them with litigation. As I know from  working 30 years ago in the private sector, you can’t advise people about existing litigation and do your job without advising them about the way to  avoid future litigation problems that  you run into.  So we know that the biggest legislative agenda item for this administration was  the  complete  takeover of  health care. And as most thinking people would understand, if you could control all health care, you can pretty  well control all people. You get to decide who gets what treatments, who  can have a new hip, who can have a  new knee, who can have radiation therapy, who can have the surgery. And as  one secretary in my hometown pointed  out, her mother acquired breast cancer  in England, and since the English Government’s wonderful health care system decided how long you had to wait  before you could get to have diagnostic  tests  done,  before  you  could  have  therapeutic activity occur, her mother  didn’t get the diagnostic tests in time  to find out she had it for sure, didn’t  get the surgery in time, didn’t get the  treatment in time and she said, My  mother died of breast cancer because  she lived in England and the government was in charge of health care.  b1440  She said I have been found to have  cancer since I’ve been here in the U.S.,  and because the government was not in  charge of my health care, I got it diagnosed in time. I got treatment in time.

405,Senate,112,-0.326,54,2012-06-29,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, S.  1335, the Pilot’s Bill of Rights, takes  several steps to protect the rights of  pilots, including modifications to the  appeals process, and improvements to  the Federal Aviation Administration’s  Notice to Airman System and medical  certification process.  Most  importantly,  it preserves the  FAA’s authority to take actions to  maintain the safety of the air transportation system, and we want to be clear  about the Congressional intent regarding one particular section of the bill.  Three provisions of the bill eliminate  language in current statute governing  the National Transportation Safety  Board’s (NTSB) adjudication of appeals  of FAA orders that deny, amend, modify, suspend, or revoke an airman’s certificate. Specifically,  language  in 49  U.S.C  §§  44703(d)(2),  44709(d)(3),  and  44710(d)(1), which expressly binds the  NTSB to ‘‘all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written  agency policy guidance available to the  public related to sanctions to be imposed . . . unless the Board finds an interpretation  to  be  arbitrary,  capricious, or otherwise not according to  law.’’  It is not the intention of the Senate  to eliminate the NTSB’s practice to observe  the principles of  judicial deference to the FAA Administrator when  reviewing airmen appeals. The Senate  only finds that this language is redundant of what is already provided for  under the law and it is not the intent  of the Senate to prevent the NTSB  from applying the principles of judicial  deference in adjudicating Federal Aviation Administration cases.  The purpose of these changes is simply  to make  the  statute consistent  with the laws governing all other Federal agencies. Thus, it is the intention  of the Senate that the NTSB, in reviewing FAA cases, will apply principles of judicial deference to the interpretations of  laws,  regulations, and  policies that the Administrator carries  out in accordance with the Supreme  Court’s ruling in Martin v. OSHRC, 449  U.S. 114 (1991).  ",2012

410,,112,0.366,117,2012-06-29,Mrs. ROBY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep disappointment with the recent  United States Supreme Court ruling on June  28, 2012  that upheld  the constitutionality of  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA).  The Court’s opinion  is  lengthy and complicated and will require careful evaluation and  review. However, we know that the Court affirmed  the view  that President Obama ’s  law  represents a significant tax on the American  people, and that it is through the federal government’s power to levy taxes that the Court  upheld the law as constitutional.  Mr. Speaker,  the Court’s  legal analysis  is  dubious and cause for concern given the dangerous precedent it sets. Can the government  now require Americans  to purchase government-approved goods and services or else  face the threat of a tax? What we do know,  however, is that the Court put restraint on the  power of Congress to mandate the purchase  of goods and services under the Commerce  Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Court ruled on the legal issues, not the  wisdom of  the policy. The American people  have already weighed in and overwhelmingly  rejected this law. As a whole, the law, which  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  predicts will cost $1.6 trillion and will result in  as many as 20 million Americans losing their  existing health care coverage, remains deeply  unpopular with the public. This is a stark contrast to the President Obama’s repeated promise that, ‘ ‘if you like your health care plan, you  can keep your health care plan.’ ’  The President’s law has also proven to be  ineffective at reducing the cost of health care,  as it is suffocating small businesses with overbearing  regulations and hampering  job creation in a time of economic uncertainty. Recent estimates indicate that the law will actually cost 800,000 American  jobs, not create  400,000  jobs as NANCY claimed  in  2010.  By law, beginning in 2014, employers with  more than 50 employees will be required to  offer health insurance coverage or face financial penalties.  In addition, an employer plan  must cover a specific set of services determined  by  the Department  of Health  and  Human Services  (HHS) and meet actuarial  standards laid out in the law. As a result, employers will be  forced  to choose whether  to  meet  the new  insurance  requirements, pay  noncompliance penalties to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), or reduce workers’ hours  so  they do not qualify as  full-time.  I have  heard from several small business owners in  my home state of Alabama, and across  the  United States, that will have financial struggles  no matter which decision they chose. How can  a business owner provide health insurance to  his employees if his business is bankrupt?  We can all agree that the Court’s preservation of PPACA’s employer health  insurance  mandate is costly, to both employers and to  their employees. Rising costs will  force employers to consider dropping health coverage  PELOSI VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:23 Jun 30, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K29JN8.002 E29JNPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2012

They have  been assisted by numerous law enforcement  agencies who have managed an orderly and  injury-free evacuation of 32,500 citizens.  The  cooperation between all  levels and  branches of government has been seamless,  coordinated, cooperative, and effective. One  example is the use of military assets, such as  C–130 MAFFS  firefighting  aircraft.  These  planes have dropped over 73,000 gallons of  slurry on this fire in coordination with the highly skilled firefighting teams on the ground. Additionally, Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force  Base, and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station have contributed firefighters, support personnel, and air and ground equipment to assist  in  fighting and containing  the  fire along  Highway 24 and on  the Air Force Academy  grounds.  The community response has been equally  impressive. Shelters,  food banks, and other  charitable  organizations  have  been  overwhelmed by the generous donations of food  and manpower.

413,House,112,-0.429,5,2012-07-09,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I wholeheartedly  support  the Veterans’ Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act  of 2012, H.R. 4114. While this committee  does not control the amount of the  COLA, it is critical that we pass the  bill so that it can be put in place when  the Social Security COLA is enacted. It  is so important that the payments that  our veterans, their families, and survivors receive keep pace with inflation  and better enable them to put food on  the table and a roof over their heads.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that last  year’s veterans COLA increase was 3.6  percent for 2012 and that we can likely  expect an increase for 2013. The exact  figure will be tied directly to the Social  Security  COLA,  whose  beneficiaries will also see the same increase  in their payments.  As  it  has  since  1976,  Congress,  through the passage of the Veterans’  Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, directs  the Secretary of the Department of  Veterans Affairs to increase the rates  of basic compensation for disabled veterans and the rates of dependency and  indemnity compensation to their survivors and dependents. This bill will  benefit disabled veterans, their families, and their survivors from the World  War I era through the current conflict  in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Many of the over 3.5 million veterans  who  receive disability  compensation  benefits depend on these payments not  only to provide for their basic needs,  but for those of their spouses, children,  and parents as well. Without an annual  COLA increase, these veterans, their  families, and survivors will likely see  the value of their hard-earned benefits  slowly eroding.  Mr. Speaker, I think we would be derelict in our duties if we fail to guarantee that those who sacrifice so much  for this country are able to receive  benefits and service that keep pace  with their needs and inflation.  b1620  We fund the wars; let’s fund the warriors.

The FLETA Board of Directors is comprised of 21 senior officials from federal law  enforcement agencies, academia, and professional organizations. Since the FLETA Board ’s  inception,  fifteen  federal  law  enforcement  academies and over 60 individual law enforcement  training programs have voluntarily presented themselves to be assessed through the  FLETA process and receive accreditation.  The FLETA Office of Accreditation is one of  the smallest entities  in  the Federal Government with only seven government employees,  yet the impact on federal training and operations  is extensive. FLETA assists  law enforcement agencies in virtually every department of the Federal Government to improve  operations through more effective and efficient  training. The mission of FLETA is more important now than ever before. This agency’s efforts are demonstrative of good government in  action, accountability  through self-regulation,  and exhibit  the  transparency  that Americans  expect of their government.  I would like to congratulate FLETA on their  10th anniversary and wish  them much success in the future as they continue to assist  federal  law enforcement operations  through  training.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR.

The United Way  is an organization created by a diverse group  of leaders in 1887 in Denver, CO, with a goal  of creating opportunities  for a better  life  in  their communities. Today,  the United Way  raises nearly $5 billion dollars annually with a  mission  to  ‘improve  lives by mobilizing  the  caring power of communities around the world  to advance the common good. ’ ’ In 2008, the  United Way set in motion three specific goals  of  improving  education,  promoting  healthy  lives, and helping people achieve financial stability.  Crisis  response after  the  tsunami struck  South Asia in 2004 and a youth-led program  to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes  in 2006 are just a few examples of how the organization has been committed  to people  in  need both  in  the United States and  internationally.  Within  the  fifteenth district of Texas,  the  United Way has served more  than 200,000  people and funded more than 100 programs in  two counties. These programs vary from women’s programs  to Boy Scouts, and  include  community projects such as the purchase of  school supplies to low income children. I hope  that you will take a moment with me today, on  the official United Way founder’s day, to recognize and remember  the great contribution  the United Way has made to our community in  the last 125 years.  25TH ANNIVERSARY OF MR.

418,,112,-0.393,47,2012-07-09,Ms. SEWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  discuss fuel efficiency, an issue that is near  and dear to the heart of all hardworking Americans. As Members of Congress, it is our mission to do all that we can to reduce America ’s  dependence on foreign oil for America’s families. We must work  hard  to  create  and  incentivize ways  to produce alternative  fuels  and reduce gas prices here at home. And we  should continue to work with our auto industry  to promote the manufacturing of more fuel efficient vehicles right here in America. America’s  auto  industry  is hard at work manufacturing  and developing the technology to manufacture  more fuel efficient vehicles.  My congressional district and  the State of  Alabama is home to many auto manufacturers  and suppliers that are achieving that goal and  are even working hard to exceed it. All Americans can contribute to promoting energy independence and environmental sustainability by  taking a few simple steps. And as we head  into the major summer driving season, it’s important to remember that we all can improve  fuel efficiency right now.  For example, using cruise control will help  drivers maintain a steady speed and save fuel.  Studies have shown that tuning your car and  keeping  tires  inflated can  increase your  fuel  economy by 3 or 4%. Driving responsibly and  at the speed limit also helps to improve fuel  economy.  The EPA’s website  provides  information  about fuel efficient driving and there are numerous agencies and organizations that provide information and resources about how to  drive more efficiently. Auto manufacturers and  associations have also undertaken efforts  to  increase awareness and educate us all about  fuel efficiency, and  I support and applaud  those efforts.  In closing, I encourage all of us to take the  time to learn how to drive more efficiently and  maximize our fuel economy. These techniques  will save Americans fuel, decrease emissions  and help us achieve energy independence.  f  HONORING KAY A. CALAS  HON.

Just as we ring in  a new year with a renewed sense of optimism, if Congress does not act, looming defense cuts will cripple our military and this Nation.  Our military will be forced to cut an  additional 10 percent from its budgets;  an additional 10 percent of resources  supporting our troops deployed overseas, fighting for our freedoms; an additional  10 percent of budgets  supporting new technologies, training, and  ships already lacking maintenance and  which are behind schedule; an additional 10 percent of our national security.  While the House passed, and I proudly  supported,  legislation  in May  to  avert these cuts, action is still needed  by the Senate and the administration.  Why does Congress continue to wait?  Why does Congress procrastinate on an  issue so pressing and so important to  this Nation? Who will answer the call?  Leaving this issue to the last minute  is irresponsible, and failure is not an  option. I urge the leaders of this Nation to stop the delay.

The Clerk read the technical language; but as I understand  it, what  happened was that the bill that we  were voting on yesterday and will vote  on today has an error and gets ‘‘employment’’ and ‘‘unemployment’’ confused and that this is a bill that would  correct the error in the bill that we debated yesterday.  So I wonder, why do we now need a  unanimous consent? Are we correcting  the  correction?  It’s  the  old Latin  phrase  ‘‘Quis  custodiet  ipsos  custodes?’’ which means, ‘‘Who guards  the guardians?’’ I guess the question  today is, Who corrects the correctors?

As children  grow and develop, they are especially vulnerable to environmental health hazards such as  air pollution, hazardous chemicals, and lead.  The number of children at risk for lead poisoning  alone  remains  unacceptably  high.  Today  there are 442,000 children with elevated blood levels, yet Congress continues to  drastically cut funding for lead poisoning prevention programs. There  is simply no safe  level of lead exposure for children. Research  has shown that lead is damaging to the developing brains of young children and can have  harmful long-term effects on behavior and IQ.  I believe it is reprehensible to allow this kind  of damage to happen to children.

Mr. Speaker,  I urge the House to  adopt this resolution which the chairman has accurately described. Members who served in the 107th Congress  will recall that in 2001 we authorized  new additions of three congressional  publications:  ‘‘Women  in Congress,’’  ‘‘Black Americans  in Congress,’’ and  ‘‘Hispanic Americans in Congress.’’  b1710  The new editions of ‘‘Women in Congress’’ and ‘‘Black Americans in Congress’’ were distributed to Members, libraries, and others in 2007 pursuant to  their respective authorizations. However, in the 11 years since we authorized the new edition of Hispanic Americans in Congress, circumstances have  changed, including, I am delighted to  say, the election of more Hispanics to  serve in this House and the other body.  This means the new edition will be  larger than estimated, and the cost of  printing the same number of copies of  Hispanic Americans will likely be larger.  As I urge adoption of this resolution,  I wish to thank the Clerk, who worked  on this revised edition, and the dedicated men and women of the Government Printing Office, who procure the  volumes for their fine work.  The new editions of ‘‘Women in Congress’’ and ‘‘Black Americans in Congress’’  are  useful,  high-quality  reference volumes of great value to students, historians, and us.

433,House,112,0.307,5,2012-09-20,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, this week another American  energy-producing  company  announced plant closures and worker layoffs, citing the Obama administration’s  authoritarian  regulatory  regime  in  part as a rationale for its decision.  Yesterday Alpha Natural Resources  announced closures of eight coal mines  in three States, one of which is located  in the Fifth Congressional District of  Pennsylvania, which I’m proud to represent. Company officials, in announcing the closures, cited  ‘‘a regulatory  environment that’s aggressively aimed  at constraining the use of coal.’’  The decision will result in layoffs of  1,200 workers and an  immediate 400  jobs  lost  in Virginia, West Virginia,  and Pennsylvania.  The fact that the coal industry is facing tough times isn’t news. They have  other  energy  competitors,  including  natural gas, and challenges with coal  transport  costs,  energy,  and  labor  costs. The issue that’s newsworthy is  the additional burden being placed on  American employers during such difficult and tough economic times.  The administration’s announced intentions to eliminate coal, our most  abundant natural resource,  from our  fuel mix, with no clear plan to replace  it with any effective alternative, has  taken a significant toll on employers  and individuals across my home State.  Here are several news headlines of  closures and layoffs in my home district from the past several months:  September 18 headline: ‘‘Alpha Natural  Resources  closing  eight  coal  mines.’’ Twelve hundred companywide  layoffs and an immediate 400 jobs cut  in Virginia, West Virginia, and my  home State of Pennsylvania.  August 30 headline: ‘‘Another round  of Joy workers laid off,’’ The Derrick:  In August, Joy Mining Manufacturing in  Franklin, Venango County, Pennsylvania,  posted another round of employee layoffs,  and 43 employees were notified they had been  furloughed from their jobs. The week before  that, 19 others were laid out. Joy Mining is  the  largest  private-sector  employer  in  Venango County.  February 9 headline: ‘‘Local Officials  Respond to Shawville Power Plant Closure’’:  GenOn Energy has about 80 employees at  its plant  in Shawville, Clearfield County,  and contributes roughly $225,000 dollars annually in local taxes. GenOn offers jobs not  only through its plant but through Amphfire  coal and trucking firms, which means a loss  of 100 to 200 workers in it is next several  years.  January  26 headline:  ‘‘FirstEnergy  Shutting Down 6 Sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland’’:  In January, FirstEnergy announced that  the new environmental regulations led to a  decision to shut down six older coal-fired  power plants  in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and  Maryland, affecting more than 500 employees.  Coal operations are closing, forcing  more workers into unemployment as  countless indirect coal jobs have been  put at risk because of the President’s  unwavering commitment to end coal.  Our most abundant natural resource is  a source of domestic energy.  In the aftermath of all these closures  and  job  losses  in my district, along  with numerous across my State and  the country,  it  is becoming  increasingly clear that this administration expects the consumers of Pennsylvania to  bear the costs of a poorly thought out,  poorly defined, and poorly explained  environmental agenda.

In 1956, Sensei Nakasone founded the Hoge Ryu Hana Nizi no Kai  Nakasone Dance Academy in Honolulu,  and  for over  five decades has been  teaching,  performing,  and  choreographing  creative dances. Her  performing skills are legendary, but it  is her aloha spirit that endures the test  of time and her passion, knowledge,  and kindness that have touched countless individuals over the years.  There is no doubt in my mind that  Sensei Nakasone is deserving of this  award, for she has dedicated her life towards preserving the Okinawan culture  while positively impacting others and  contributing  to  the  diversity  and  uniqueness of our culture in the United  States of America.  f  FISCAL CLIFF  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)

435,House,112,-0.343,12,2012-09-20,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, last week the San Diego Chamber of  Commerce sent its largest ever delegation of community and business leaders  to Washington. They  came because  they know Washington can help them  spur the economy, innovate, and employ local workers if we can all get on  the same page.  What grand request did they have for  this Congress to help make progress  happen? Well, just that we do our job:  that we roll up our sleeves, work together across party lines, and find a  sensible, not an arbitrary, balance of  cuts and spending.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, this country is facing some hard choices, and, yes, there  is division in this Chamber, but we do  not need to add to the serious challenges facing American businesses and  families by  sitting on  the  sidelines  watching a completely manmade disaster explode upon our economy.  Let’s work together to come to decisions  now. The American  economy  should not be facing a fiscal cliff; it  should be receiving a fiscal roadmap.  By actually doing our  jobs, we can  make the jobs of our hardworking constituents a little easier.  Our  job  is not done, Mr. Speaker.  Cancel the congressional recess.  f  CELEBRATING NEW MEXICO’S  CENTENNIAL  (Mr. HEINRICH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2012
436,House,112,-0.41,26,2012-09-20,Mr. CROWLEY.," I thank my friend  and colleague, the ranking member, for  yielding me this time.  With just days to go before the majority adjourns until after the election,  there are numerous pressing bills we  should be completing, but it seems that  nothing will stop my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle from the opportunity to spend time criticizing our  President with a political stunt bill  once again.  I would think that an effort to move  at least 20 percent more—that’s 20 percent more—people  from welfare  to  work would be applauded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  That’s right, an increase in employment among TANF recipients under  the proposal by the President. But, instead, that bill we’re considering today  actually stops people from moving towards work.  Now, I know there has been a resistance to passing a jobs bill by this majority, but this is absolutely ridiculous.  It’s one thing not to have a jobs bill on  the floor, but to have a bill on the floor  that  would  actually  say  ‘‘don’t  incentivize more people to find work  opportunity’’ just really is ridiculous.  The truth is my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle seem much more  interested in attacking the President  than in truly working to improve programs and policies, as evidenced by the  unfinished work that they are leaving  behind.  I hope my colleagues will see through  this charade on both sides of the aisle  and will all vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill so we  can get back to work on serious issues  and not political gamesmanship.

454,Senate,112,0.375,89,2012-09-20,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, Americans have endured 4 years of the worst  recession in the last 70 years in this  country. We have 23 million Americans  either unemployed or underemployed,  and millions more have simply given  up finding a job. What is the President’s response in the face of all this?  Reject every plan presented by Republicans and, instead, spend $5 trillion of  borrowed  money  leading—so-called  leading—our country into decline and  ultimately into bankruptcy.  What is the Democratically led Senate’s response? Avoid all efforts to formulate a plan to address this problem  and to vote and debate on that plan on  one of the most critical—if not the  most critical—issues facing this country in its history. The American public  is desperate for new leadership, both  from the White House and from the  Senate—leadership that  is absolutely  necessary if we are to restore our Nation to growth and prosperity and get  our people back to work.  ",2012
455,Senate,112,0.377,89,2012-09-20,Mr. WICKER.," Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times said this:  ‘‘The 112th Congress is set to enter the  Congressional record books as the least  productive body in a generation.’’  This is true, and the responsibility  falls squarely at the feet of the Democratic Senate leadership. The Senate  has taken just 193 recorded votes this  year. The Senate has been more than 3  years since passing a budget. The majority leader has shut off the right to  amend a record number of times. The  majority leader has filled the amendment tree a record 66 times—more than  his 6 predecessors in the Senate who  did it a total of 40 times. The majority  leader has shut off the right to debate.  He calls up a bill, he files cloture on it,  and then he has the audacity to call  that a filibuster.  In short, the Democrats have failed  to pass a budget, have failed to do a  single appropriations bill, and have  failed to consider a Defense authorization bill when we have troops in harm’s  way. America needs new leadership.  ",2012
456,Senate,112,-0.173,145,2012-09-20,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, along  with my colleague Senator COONS, I  wish to recognize a valued leader and  respected public servant as he embarks  upon his retirement following a long  and distinguished career: the Honorable Robert P. Gilligan, speaker of the  House of Representatives of Delaware.  As the longest serving house member  in Delaware’s history, Bob Gilligan has  devoted his career  to bettering  the  State of Delaware. A native of Wilmington, Bob went to Pennsylvania to  earn his bachelor’s degree from St. Joseph’s University and a master’s degree  from Villanova University. But, fortunately for the people of Delaware and  specifically those in Sherwood Park in  northern Delaware, Bob soon returned  to the First State to begin a remarkable career in public service.  Bob was first elected to the Delaware  House of Representatives in 1972, and  he has served there with distinction for  the past 40 years. As representative of  the  19th District, he has  served as  house majority leader from 1983–1984,  house minority whip  from  1985–1995,  and house minority leader from 1995–  2008. In 2008, Bob was elected by his  peers to be the 145th general assembly  speaker of the house.  During my time as Governor of Delaware, I had the great fortune of working with Bob on a host of important  issues,  including  education  reform,  welfare reform, and fiscal policy that  led to Delaware’s credit rating being  raised to AAA  for the  first time  in  State history—a rating that the State  still enjoys today. I have had the privilege of watching Bob grow as a leader  in the State house and, ultimately, as  speaker over the course of his 40-year  tenure. During that time, what I came  to admire most about Bob was his ability to bring people together to work  collaboratively. His peers on both sides  of the aisle have noted Bob’s ability to  form partnerships and ensure the house  proceeds in a civil and orderly manner.  This is a truly laudable feat made even  more impressive by the fact that over  the past 40 years, Bob has worked with  8 different Governors, 67 different State  senators, 176 different State representatives, worked on 12 different committees, and had the opportunity to vote  on over 15,000 House Bills.  Bob leaves behind a legacy of creating a more open, responsible, and accountable government. When he first  took office as speaker in 2008, Bob’s  goal was clear: He wanted to change  business as usual in Dover. Almost immediately,  sessions  began  on  time,  committee meetings were scheduled at  least 48 hours in advance, and agendas  were made public at  least 24 hours  prior  to meeting. But  the  reforms  didn’t  stop  there. Under Bob’s new  leadership, the first bill of the new general assembly was his bill, House Bill 1,  which made the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, applicable to the general assembly, effectively opening the  legislature to FOIA requests. And, fittingly, as Bob closed the chapter on his  career in the house, he introduced one  of his final bills, House Bill 300, which  requires stricter disclosure laws with  regard to campaign finance, helping to  ensure that elections in Delaware races  are conducted in a fair and transparent  manner.  Upon his retirement, Bob described  the essence of his leadership and reiterated his faith in Delaware’s approach  to good governance: ‘‘I hope this place  never becomes  like Washington D.C.  It’s our state. You’ve got to do what’s  right for the state. Good government  and making good decisions is good politics, and if you don’t get elected because of a tough decision, you still  sleep well. All the decisions I’ve made,  I never lost any sleep.’’  A man of extraordinary service, Bob  is known as a hard-working and active  legislator. In addition to his responsibilities as speaker of the house, he  served on the House Administration,  Ethics, House Rules, and Veteran Affairs Committees. Prior to his role as  speaker, Bob served as a member of the  Joint Finance Committee  and was  chairman of the Bond Bill Committee,  the Health and Human Development  Committee, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Bob’s leadership and commitment to serving others  extends well  beyond  the State  house. He is a life member of the Mill  Creek Fire Company; a board member  of the Blood Bank of Delmarva; a cofounder  of  the  Mid-County  and  Absalom Jones Senior Centers; and, a  parishioner of St. John the Beloved in  Wilmington, DE.  In addition  to his  title of ‘‘speaker,’’ Bob is also known  by the title of ‘‘professor’’ to many students through his role as an educator  at Delaware Technical and Community  College in Stanton.  Given Bob’s incredible career of public service—both as an elected official  and as a private citizen—I was of two  minds when I heard of his plans to retire. On the one hand, Delaware will  sorely miss its devoted public servant  and leader. On the other hand, however, he will take some very well-deserved time to enjoy life with his wife  Jeanne, their two daughters, son-in-  law,  and  three  grandchildren, Cole,  Delaney, and Asher. We are in Jeanne’s  debt for sharing her husband of many  years with  the people of  the First  State.  I am truly honored to have worked  with Bob Gilligan for many years and  call him my friend. It is truly a privilege to pay tribute to a man who has  done so much for the great State of  Delaware for all of these years.∑  ∑",2012
457,Senate,112,-0.249,145,2012-09-20,Mr. COONS.," Mr. President, I am honored to join my senior Senator, TOM  CARPER, as we rise today to honor the  legacy of one of Delaware’s  longest  serving  elected officials—Speaker of  the House Bob Gilligan.  Speaker Gilligan has served in the  Delaware House of Representatives for  4 decades, elected to 20 consecutive  terms by his constituents. Bob was  first elected in 1972 at age 29—a remarkably young age to be so focused  and service-minded.  A lot has changed in this country  since 1972, but not Bob’s commitment  to Delaware, to education, to equal  rights and to making our State a better place to live.  After 40 years of service, Speaker  Gilligan is retiring at the end of this  legislative session to spend more time  with his  family,  including his wife  Jeanne, his daughters Katie and Shannon, and his son-in-law Gavin, as well  as his grandchildren, Delaney, Cole,  and Asher.  Earlier this year, a number of us  gathered at the Mill Creek Fire Hall,  where Bob is a lifetime honorary member,  and  celebrated  70/40—his  70th  birthday and his 40th year of public  service. All it took was a look at the  crowd that gathered to see the real and  positive impact Speaker Gilligan has  had on our community. He always kept  his constituents from his district first  and foremost on his mind, even as he  worked on issues of broader impact to  our State and even our Nation.  It was  through Speaker Gilligan’s  leadership that real transparency and  openness was  brought  to Delaware  State government. He led the way for  House Bill 1—legislation in 2009 that  made  our  State’s  open-government  laws apply to the General Assembly.  That may sound like simple fairness  and good governance, but it wasn’t an  easy road to get there. It took all of  Bob’s legislative acumen to get it done,  and now all Delawareans benefit from a  more accountable and open government.  Our State has benefitted from Bob’s  passion  and  commitment  in  other  ways, too. His legacy is felt in education programs and schools across our  State, as well as at the Mid-County  Senior Center, which he helped found  to support local seniors and provide the  recreational, educational, and nutritional services necessary for a dignified  retirement.  In these times of deep division and  heated  political  rhetoric, Bob  is  a  breath of fresh air. He listens to diverse  perspectives  and  values  principled compromise. As someone who  has been around long enough to serve  as both Speaker of the House and Minority Leader  for Delaware, he has  worked hard to find ways to bring people together.  Our State and our Nation could use  more Bob Gilligans, and I join Delawareans  of  all  political  parties  in  thanking him for his decades of service  and wishing him well  in his retirement.∑  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:55 Sep 21, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20SE6.074 S20SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2012
458,,112,-0.317,173,2012-09-20,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4158, to Confirm Full Ownership  Rights for Certain United States Astronauts to  Artifacts from the Astronauts’ Space Missions  Act.  H.R. 4158 preserves the rights of astronauts  who served on the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s, through  the time of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Flight, to retain full and complete ownership of certain artifacts such as personal logs and flight manuals that were used in training or during their  flights.  For many years, it was an accepted practice  for astronauts to keep mementos of their training and flight missions.  However, confusion surrounding NASA’s informal policies on artifacts have  led  to attempts to repossess those artifacts years later.  This has resulted  in questions concerning  the status of items that astronauts have had in  their possession for years, if not decades, or  donated to museums, universities, scholarship  funds, and so forth.  I support  this bill, because  it clarifies  that  the ownership of those artifacts rests with the  astronauts who served during those missions,  while preserving the current policy that ownership of moon rocks and lunar material will continue to rest with the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, we lost an  American hero, Neil Armstrong. He and his  fellow astronauts  fulfilled  the dreams of a  grateful nation by pushing the boundaries of  space.  One small way to show our gratitude is by  passing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2012  ",2012
460,,112,-0.455,173,2012-09-20,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on one of the most important pieces of  federal legislation impacting our coastal, great  lakes and ocean  resources stretching  from  Fagatele Bay in American Samoa to the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary along the East  Coast. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act,  which was signed on October 23, 1972, recognized  the value of  these national  treasures;  designating marine protected areas for current  and future generations.  40  years  later,  communities  across  the  country have seen real dividends from these  federal investments and are expressing their  interests in protecting their own waters. Reactivation of NOAA’s Site Evaluation List, a scientifically rigorous and publicly reviewed list of  sites, is being considered as part of the Strategic Action Plan  to  implement our National  Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, Our  Coasts, and the Great Lakes. It would bring a  renewed  commitment  to  conserve, protect,  and enhance the biodiversity, ecological integrity and cultural legacy of our nation ’s system  of marine protected areas.  In my experience,  the most  remarkable  thing about  the National Marine Sanctuary  Program  is  the  transformation which occurs  when communities  recognize  they have  the  opportunity to become stewards of their local  marine  environment.  I  cannot  emphasize  enough that ours and future generations will  increasingly depend on a healthy ocean —for  ecological, economic, educational, scientific,  social, cultural and  recreational benefits, as  well as for the food we eat. For me, the best  example is the Monterey Bay National Marine  Sanctuary, which this year celebrates its 20th  Anniversary.  The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary emerged from a collaboration of local officials, civic minded citizens, environmentalists  and many others who were concerned about  the possibility of oil drilling on  the Central  Coast. Their hard work resulted in the establishment of the largest marine sanctuary in the  Continental U.S.  It goes down more  than 2  miles and is almost as deep as the Rockies  are  tall.  Its undersea mountain — ‘Davidson  Seamount’ —is higher than any coastal mountain, 7480 ft. tall, and it supports one of the  most bio-diverse ecosystems in the world.  I am fortunate to represent a congressional  district that has one of the greatest synergies  of ocean science and research in the world.  And it is through increased understanding of  our marine sanctuaries that we become better  stewards of our blue planet. The National Marine Sanctuary Program is charting the course  forward through research and education and it  is only fitting that, on this anniversary of the  National Marine Sanctuaries Act, we in Congress commend  the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and all of our nation’s sanctuaries  for their significant work in advancing understanding and protection of the world ’s oceans.

461,,112,-0.402,18,2012-09-28,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the borough of Atlantic Highlands,  New Jersey on their 125th anniversary celebration. Atlantic Highlands and  its citizens,  with their hard work, dedication, and commitment to community, personify the quintessential American spirit.  Founded  in 1887,  the borough of Atlantic  Highlands was originally part of Middletown  Township. However, during the latter part of  the 1800’s, the area that is currently known as  Atlantic Highlands was beginning to gain the  attention  of  local  businessmen  and  vacationers for its scenic landscape and proximity  to Raritan Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. After  its incorporation as a borough in 1897, Atlantic  Highlands began  to develop steadily. Steam  ship and rail service were the source of major  transportation  in  the area, with steam ships  bringing vacationers to the borough from New  York City and the surrounding area. In 1940,  the municipal harbor was completed, which allowed  the borough  to accommodate significantly more travelers and vessels, which increased access to the borough.  Today,  the borough remains a destination  for travelers and vacationers, as well as home  to more than 4,300 residents. The municipal  harbor is the largest on the east coast, with  the ability  to accommodate upwards of 700  vessels. Offering high  speed  ferry  service  since 1992,  the harbor and  its  ferry service  serves as a scenic and convenient method of  mass transportation for commuters traveling to  New York City. The local businesses and business owners in the borough take great pride  in their ability to provide great destinations for  their  local  community  and  vacationers  to  enjoy. The citizens of Atlantic Highlands, along  with the leadership of Mayor Fred Rast III and  the borough council, make the Borough of Atlantic Highlands a  truly great place  to  live,  work, and visit.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in leading this  body in congratulating the borough of Atlantic  Highlands, New Jersey on their 125th anniversary. I take great pride in having the opportunity and  responsibility of  representing  the  borough and  its citizen ’s  interests here  in  Washington DC.

462,,112,-0.321,18,2012-09-28,Mr. REYES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the achievements and success of two  programs at  the University of Texas at El  Paso (UTEP). The Master of Business Administration  (MBA) Program and  the Reverse  Transfer Program are being  recognized by  Excelencia in Education.  Excelencia in Education focuses on accelerating success for Latino students at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate  levels.  Since 2005, Excelencia has honored programs  and departments at  the cutting edge of  increasing and  improving academic achievement for Latinos.  UTEP’s Reverse Transfer Program, honored  by Excelencia as a finalist, allows transfer students to earn their final credits at UTEP, and  then have those credits sent back to El Paso  Community College to fulfill the balance of the  associate degree requirement. This program  increases  the graduation  rates at El Paso  Community College, and increases UTEP’s retention rate, Which results in improving access  to higher education for all students.  UTEP’s Master of Business Administration  Program, honored by Excelencia as an awardee, serves over 400 students from more than  20 countries  from a variety of backgrounds.  The MBA program was  recognized  for  the  third year in a row as the number one program for Hispanics in the Nation by the Hispanic Business Magazine. The program  reflects Excelencia  in Education by blending  quality graduate education and affordability.  I want  to personally congratulate UTEP’s  Master of Business Administration and Reverse Transfer programs for their recognition,  which  is a  testament  to  the hard work and  dedication of faculty, administration, and students. I look forward to the continued success  of UTEP, and I am honored to represent this  outstanding institution.  f  HONORING LEE MARIE ANDERSON  HON.

463,,112,-0.274,25,2012-09-28,Mr. WALZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Russell-Tyler-  Ruthton (RTR) Elementary School in Ruthton,  Minnesota.  On September 7th, RTR Elementary School  was named one of two schools from the First  District of Minnesota  to be designated as a  2012 National Blue Ribbon School.  This award  recognizes exemplary schools  like RTR Elementary School where students  have consistently scored  the  top of assessment results. Recipients of this award truly exemplify  the State of Minnesota’s belief  that  every child has promise and must receive a  high quality education.  As a teacher on leave from Mankato West,  I know that achieving success for all students  takes a commitment  from  the entire school,  from  the principal  to  the counselors  to  the  teachers. When students see every adult  in  their school dedicated  to  their success and  achieving a higher goal, they are motivated to  do their best.  This  is exactly what RTR Elementary has  done for its students. Under the leadership of  Principal Amy Christensen, they have focused  on building relationships with every student,  and executing the RTR Literacy Plan to ensure success  in  the English Language Arts.  Their efforts have led to exceptional results.  This award recognizes what the RTR Elementary School community already knows—  RTR Elementary is a place where every student, no matter their ability or background, can  fulfill their potential. RTR Elementary is an outstanding model of achievement  for schools  across Minnesota and the country.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in honoring  RTR Elementary School for its dedication to  the students of Ruthton.

464,,112,-0.606,8,2012-10-16,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to express my thanks and support for  recent actions by Northwestern University  to  help students register to vote and navigate increasingly complex and strict voter registration  procedures  nationwide.  Their  efforts were  chronicled in an article by the New York Times  this past Sunday, and  I hope  that my colleagues will pay attention to the story and its  lessons.  Today, roughly 11 million college students  are  eligible  to  vote. Unfortunately,  states  across the country have considered or passed  legislative initiatives that erect barriers to student voting. Northwestern University, which I  am proud to represent, rose to the challenge  and adopted a series of policies to ensure that  its student body could go to the polls. When  incoming  freshman picked up  their student  IDs, they were given the opportunity to register to vote. Volunteers took time out of their  day  to make sure  that out-of-state students  were given absentee request forms, and any  assistance  they  required so  that  their vote  would count when they engaged in their civic  duty.  As  last weekend’s  article  noted, Northwestern University’s initiatives were wildly successful. Last year, 89% of  incoming Northwestern freshmen were registered to vote in  37 states by the first day of class. This year,  the university again saw dramatic success—  almost 95% of  their eligible  freshman were  registered as of the first day of classes, and  out-of-state students had  the  tools  to make  sure  their vote was not denied due  to new  state regulations.  After  the enormous success seen on  its  campus, Northwestern University expanded its  project and created  the UVote Project. The  UVote Project shares these proven registration  techniques to campuses across the nation —  providing consistent and streamlined registration efforts so  that students get  the support  they need  to participate  in  the democratic  process. According to the project’s web page,  schools who adopt  these methods  typically  see their student voter registration rates double or triple.  These recent efforts by Northwestern University and their UVote Project are the type of  collaboration between students and institutions  of higher learning that I envisioned when I introduced the Student VOTER Act, a bill that  would make institutions of higher learning play  a key  role  in voter  registration efforts. The  contents of  this bill have been  incorporated  into H.R. 5799, the Voter Empowerment Act of  2012. The Voter Empowerment Act modernizes and overhauls our voter registration system  to assure  that as many people are  involved in our democratic process as possible,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.  I congratulate Northwestern President Morty  Shapiro and hope other universities will follow  his lead. Together, through policies like those  created  by  Northwestern  University  and  through  legislation such as  the Voter Empowerment Act of 2012, we can encourage increased engagement and participation, including among student voters.  [From the New York Times, Oct. 13, 2012]  COLLEGESTAKEALEAPINTOVOTER  REGISTRATION  (By Steven Yaccino)  EVANSTON, IL.—Every  four years, volunteers swarm university campuses, clipboards  in hand, to register newly eligible voters for  what is generally the only presidential election of their undergraduate careers. This  year they found large numbers were already  registered.  Dozens of colleges have begun their own  voting registration drives in orientation programs, class registration, intranet Web sites  and other  interactions crucial to campus  life,  institutionalizing  services  that  had  often been left to outside efforts. As a result,  thousands of students registered to vote, updated their addresses or requested absentee  ballots from their home states within days of  arriving to campus this fall, officials at several universities said.  University-sponsored  attempts  to make  voting easier for students are being tested in  at least 60 colleges across the country amid  the outbreak of battles over new voting laws.  ‘‘The voter registration process has become more  cumbersome and difficult as  there’s been a competition to define who is  eligible to vote,’’ said Dan A. Lewis, director  of Northwestern University’s  Center  for  Civic Engagement, which  started  incorporating voter registration into its freshman  orientation last year. ‘‘You almost have to  have a Ph.D. now to figure out how to do it  if you’re not sitting in the same house for  the past 20 years.’’  Northwestern officials who developed the  new program, UVote Project, said their intent was not to critique voting rules across  the country, but to help students navigate  them more easily.  ‘‘We’re not always going to have the incredible excitement among 18- to 22–year-  olds that you did in 2008, so I think it’s an  obligation,’’ said Morton Schapiro, the president of Northwestern.  ‘‘We’re supposed to  teach citizenship.’’  Northwestern, just north of Chicago, began  a drive to register voters last year, with incoming  students  signing  up when  they  picked up  their  campus  IDs. University-  trained staff and volunteers provided absentee ballot request forms from all 50 states,  scanned students’ driver’s licenses or other  identification, and offered to mail in the paperwork.  By the first day of class, 89 percent of the  university’s freshmen had been registered to  vote, in 37 states. Northwestern repeated the  effort this year, registering almost 95 percent of eligible freshmen, and expanded the  model to eight other colleges. Stanford University used the method around campus, including on its bicycle registration line, netting more than 700 new voters in two weeks.  Roughly 11 million eligible voters ages 18  to 24 are in college, about a quarter of all eligible young voters, according to the Center  for  Information  and Research  on  Civic  Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.  The federal Higher Education Amendments  of 1998 require colleges to make a ‘‘good faith  effort’’ to distribute registration materials  to transient students, who have the option to  establish residency in their home community or where they go to school.  Students who prefer to vote absentee must  first traverse an array of varied rules. Some  states, like Michigan and Tennessee, make  voters who register by mail cast a ballot in  person for their first election. North Carolina requires that ballot requests be handwritten. Other states, like Delaware and Wyoming, require a notary.  Complicating matters more this election  have been partisan fights over restrictions  on registration drives and new laws requiring state-issued IDs for voting, though many  have been overturned or blocked this year.  Harvard University, which holds a competition among dormitories to register the  most voters, is one of a growing number of  schools expanding efforts by purchasing access to the Web site of TurboVote, a nonprofit effort that provides complete online  registration  and  automated  vote-bymail  services.  Founded  in 2010, TurboVote  is working  with 58 colleges this year. It now helps more  than 100,000 individuals get absentee ballots,  find voting locations and track coming elections, sending out text reminders for important deadlines.  ‘‘We single-handedly registered more people in a couple of hours than several organizations  that  have  been  doing  this  for  months,’’  said Shelby Taylor,  a  spokeswoman for the University of Florida, which  promoted  TurboVote  on  the  college’s  intranet home page and in an e-mail from  the university’s president. The school, which  registered more  than  3,000  students  this  year, also flashed ads for TurboVote on the  football stadium’s GatorVision screen during  the opening home game last month.  ‘‘We alone cannot do this,’’ said Heather  Smith, president of Rock the Vote, which  has been registering voters on campuses for  two decades. ‘‘If we could get every university engaged and invested in the work of asking every one of their students to register to  vote, we’d have a very different democracy.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:27 Oct 17, 2012 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A16OC8.013 E16OCPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s ‘         ",2012
465,,112,-0.686,5,2012-10-23,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to honor  the extraordinary career and  tremendous  accomplishments  of Dr. Pearl  Alice Marsh of California as she retires from a  distinguished career in academia, public service and advocacy for both the United States  and throughout Africa. Emerging from humble  roots  to become  the  first African-American  woman to receive a doctorate degree in Political Science from the University of California,  Berkeley, Dr. Marsh continues to be an inspiring trailblazer.  Dr. Marsh’s prolific career includes a decade of service as Senior Professional Staff for  Africa on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Yet, Dr. Marsh’s long record of activism  is at the heart of her call to service. Playing  a role in some of the defining civil and human  rights movements of our  time, Dr. Marsh  spoke out for non-discriminatory Fair Housing  in California and helped drive the Civil Rights,  Students, Health Rights, Women’s and African  Liberation movements  throughout  the 1960s  and 1970s. This bold activism was part of an  engine  for  enormous  social  and  political  change, and Dr. Marsh’s passion  for social  justice went on to inform every aspect of her  long career.  Pearl Alice Marsh began her career as a social worker and advisor  to  the Oak Park  Neighborhood  Council  Member  in  Sacramento, CA, in 1968. Throughout the 1970s  and early 1980s, she held many key positions  driving efforts  to strengthen  the response of  California  communities  to  mental  health  issues, including joining the University of California, Berkeley to coordinate health administration and planning seminars for the Neighborhood Health Seminars Project and becoming  the Associate Director of Mental Health  Planning at Northern Alameda County.  Yet, in 1986, Dr. Marsh turned her attention  back to academia and her studies of Africa,  accepting a position as Program Director of  Berkeley’s Center for African Studies. In 1993,  she moved to Washington, DC, to put her academic skills into policy practice as the Senior  Research Associate for International Affairs at  the Joint Center  for Political and Economic  Studies. In this critical role, Dr. Marsh developed and convened a series of multi-party forums in the run-up to the South African elections, which  saw  the  election  of Nelson  Mandela as  the  first black president of  the  newly  racially-integrated South Africa. She  later became Executive Director at the Africa  Policy  Information Center, where she supervised the development of the Advocacy Network for Africa, a network of over 60 human  rights, advocacy and humanitarian organizations working  to  raise  the  level of understanding and attention to current events in Africa through key policymakers.  In the years that followed, Dr. Marsh employed her ample knowledge and expertise to  help guide Congressional policy as Senior Policy Advisor  for  International Affairs and Domestic Policy  for Congresswoman  Juanita  Millender-McDonald. And, for the next decade,  from 2000  to 2011, Dr. Marsh served as a  Professional Staff Member on the House International Relations Committee and  the Committee on Foreign Affairs where she reported  to consecutive chairmen and helped  to develop two key pieces of legislation —the U.S.  Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Authorization Act of 2003  that created PEPFAR and  the Tom Lantos  and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Against  HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Authorization Act of 2003, which has helped to provide AIDS treatment for more than 6.6 million  people around the world.  In the final chapter of her professional career, Dr. Marsh returned to her activist roots,  assuming the position of Director of U.S. Policy and Global Health at the ONE Campaign,  where she developed an advocacy plan  to  scale up African co-financing of their national  health needs.  On behalf of the residents of California’s 9th  Congressional District, Dr. Pearl Alice Marsh,  I salute you.  I am proud  to call you a colleague, a former constituent, but most importantly my friend. Thank you for your countless  contributions to the struggle for equal opportunity and  for your manifold commitment  to  teaching,  advocating  and  producing  groundbreaking U.S. foreign policy in the fight  against global poverty and disease.  I congratulate you on your many achievements,  and I wish you and your loved ones all the  best in this next chapter of life.

Dave Hill came to the United States by way  of the United Kingdom where he received his  doctorate degree in mathematical physics from  Imperial College, London University. As an expert in nuclear reactor and fuel cycle issues,  Dave assumed  leadership positions at Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  In 2005, Dave  joined  the  Idaho National Laboratory as deputy lab director for science and technology.  Dave brought a wonderful vision and talent  to INL and his imprint is visible in the new and  improved facilities that INL scientists and engineers now use. Dave saw the unique role INL  can play as our National Nuclear Laboratory  and he helped demonstrate how INL ’s capabilities could support important nuclear energy,  nonproliferation  and  national  security  programs. Dave also helped bring an unmatched  collection of world-renowned technical experts  to Idaho to lead the Nation’s nuclear energy  programs. While serious budget challenges  are staring every federal program in the face,  Dave will leave the Idaho National Laboratory  with a firm foundation. I also understand we  will continue to benefit from some of Dave’s  time and talents in the future.  While Dave Hill’s leadership skills and vision  have made INL a stronger lab, Dave’s good  humor and his laugh have made INL a better  place  to work. On his many  trips  to Washington, DC, Dave would often come by my office, at my request, to update me on nuclear  energy programs and issues. Dave would always paint me  the picture  I needed  to see  along with a laugh and a smile at the challenges we were tackling together.

A Member  of Congress’ most important responsibility is to  provide exceptional constituent services and  my staff  is second  to none  in providing  the  best assistance to everyone in our district. I  take great pride in the work that each one has  done on my behalf and on behalf of everyone  in  the 11th Congressional District of North  Carolina.  Each District staff member has shown a  strong sense of dedication  in meeting  the  needs of each and every one of our constituents. They often go well beyond  the call  to  make sure each constituent  is  treated  fairly  and respectfully by our government agencies  and that they receive appropriate resolution. I  owe a debt of gratitude to each one of them  for the support and friendship which they have  shown me while I have served in Congress.  Bruce Peterson served as my first District  Director. In this key role, Bruce was the driving  force behind establishing every detail of  our district operation. Bruce’s knowledge of  local government and officials proved invaluable as we developed relationships and methods  for providing  top-notch services  to  folks  across western North Carolina. Bruce used his  extensive background as a school administrator to help develop the excellent constituent  services that our office has been recognized  for during these past six years of service.  Bruce should be proud of the service he has  provided  to our district and country.  It has  been an honor to serve with him and as I retire from office I wish him the very best in the  future. Western North Carolina  is a better  place because of his efforts and I will cherish  the memories of serving with Bruce and the  team by my side.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in recognizing and  thanking Bruce Peterson  for his hard work on behalf of all of western  North Carolina and to wish him continued success in his future endeavors.  f  A TRIBUTE TO THE SACRAMENTO  JAPANESE AMERICAN CITIZENS  LEAGUE  HON.

Through their long history, the Sacramento  JACL has been dedicated  to advancing  the  civil  rights of all Americans, deterring hate  crimes across the Nation, and helping to lead  the Japanese-American community  to social  and economic equality. On Thursday, November  15,  2012,  the Sacramento  Japanese  American Citizens League will host  its 17th  annual community awards dinner.  During the dinner, the Sacramento JACL will  honor:  the  Sacramento  Japanese  United  Methodist Church, one of  the oldest Japanese-American  congregations  in  Northern  California;  the  Sacramento  Senator  Lions  Club, a civic organization  that provides  its  members with opportunities to serve the community  through  fundraising  and  hands-on  projects; and the Sakura Minyo Doo Koo Kai,  a  troupe  that performs  traditional Japanese  folk song and dance. These  three organizations and  their members have worked diligently to serve the community, teach others  about the history of Japanese-Americans, and  help preserve  the  Japanese  culture. They  stand as organizations that truly embrace the  dinner’s  theme of  ‘Bunka  Isan,’ ’ helping  the  community honor the lives of their ancestors  and celebrating their own lives as Americans.  During the dinner, the Sacramento JACL will  also honor my friend and colleague, California  Assemblywoman Mariko Yamada. Mariko has  dedicated her life to serving the public in many  capacities: working as an investigator for the  U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office  for  Civil Rights; as a member of the Yolo County  Board of Supervisors; and now representing  her constituents in the California State Assembly. She has had tremendous success in the  California Assembly, passing  landmark bills  that imposed greater criminal penalties on assailants that abuse the elderly and disabled,  provided increased housing and employment  opportunities  for our veterans, and reformed  government  policies  to  protect  consumers  from negligence and fraud. Mariko has made  California and our Nation a better place for all,  and is truly worthy of tonight’s honoring.  Mr. Speaker, I hereby recognize and commend  the Sacramento Chapter of  the Japanese American Citizens League and their honorees  for  their  continued  service  to Sacramento, California and our Nation. I ask all  my colleagues to join with me in wishing them  continued success and support as they work  to protect the civil rights of all our citizens, and  preserve the history of Japanese-Americans.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

We should have stricter enforcement  of  sanctions against  Iran.  Iran and  Hamas both need to be held accountable for these attacks. Israel had the  moral right and legal duty to defend  itself from attacks by the barbarians,  Hamas. There is a ceasefire, but only  until Hamas obtains more Iranian missiles.  Hamas is the puppet, and Iran is the  puppeteer. The Iranian regime needs to  go.

",2012
472,,112,0.407,18,2012-11-29,Mr. PAULSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize the more than 65  million  family caregivers across the  Nation who work tirelessly and selflessly to care for loved ones who are  chronically ill, disabled or aging. So  this month, we  celebrate National  Family Caregivers Month, which is a  time to thank all those heroes who sacrifice their time and effort in looking  after others.  It is estimated that family caregivers  provide 80 percent of our Nation’s long-  term care, saving families about $375  billion annually. Caregivers are the silent heroes of the family. They work  day in and day out to ensure that those  in need of care receive that support.  Taking care of sick family members is,  no doubt, a difficult job; and I encourage caregivers to continue to utilize  the resources they have in their communities for support.  I would like to acknowledge the hard  work of the family caregivers in Minnesota and of those helping families in  America. Your work to support your  families exemplifies the true meaning  of putting someone else’s needs first.  f  f  HAMAS IS THE PUPPET AND IRAN  IS THE PUPPETEER  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

As a  longstanding member on the  Subcommittee on Immigration and on  Homeland Security, STEM  is now a  basis for expanding visas to ensure or  to give opportunities to young people  who are graduating from our research  institutions of higher  learning who  have been born in other countries and  to give them the ability to be able to  stay here in order to help create jobs  and to build this economy. That’s a  good thing. Yet on November 6, 2012, I  think America spoke and said, We’re  ready to do more and go further.  I voted ‘‘no’’ on the rule because I believe we are ready for comprehensive  immigration  reform,  not  something  that will hurt us, but something that  will help us. For those who appreciated  the Statue of Liberty that welcomed  the poor and the downtrodden, that  welcomed the Irish and the Germans  and the Italians, we know that comprehensive immigration reform is the  right way. This rule, H. Res. 821, is not  the right way.

Let me  just say today that we’re  members of  the Progressive Caucus  talking about the deal for all. First of  all, we are laying out some of our values, but also talking about some things  that are really problems in this debate.  I mentioned before and you mentioned, as well, Social Security is not  contributing to the deficit. Social Security is solvent through 2037. Social  Security may need attention, but to  try to fix it in the midst of this debate  is not  the  right  thing. Again,  I’m  speaking only for myself. People who  are demanding that we reform Social  Security  right now are people who  want us to put attention on something  that is other than the problem, and  then I have to wonder why that  is.  Does it have something to do with the  fact that ever since Franklin Delano  Roosevelt signed the legislation, that  there have been some that don’t like it.  Why? Because they don’t think the  proper role of government is to have a  program administered through the government that looks out for the aged,  the  disabled,  the  vulnerable. They  don’t think the government should do  that. They think it’s all about 100 percent  individual  initiative, and  they  don’t believe the government has a role  or responsibility to administer a program to make sure the aged and the  sick and those who are the children of  those people who may have died should  have some basic sustenance.  We disagree philosophically and fundamentally, but some folks—there is a  concept out there known as the ‘‘shock  doctrine.’’ A woman  named Naomi  Klein wrote a very interesting book.  Sometimes you will have  folks who  will create a crisis. They want there to  be a crisis because within the context  of the crisis, the parties to the bargaining will be willing to do things  that in the absence of a crisis they  would never agree to. So I believe that  these expiring deadlines don’t have to  be a crisis, but they’ve been created to  be one. We even use words that invoke  imagery of a crisis, and that’s why we  now talk about this thing as to what it  really is, which is expiring deadlines.  ",2012

478,,112,-0.353,123,2012-11-29,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. President, today I am  introducing bipartisan legislation that will improve the  viability of agriculture and rural communities in western States like Colorado. This legislation will make it easier for mutual ditch and irrigation companies, which are an integral part of  agriculture in arid regions where you  often  have  to  transport  irrigation  water over long distances, to remain  profitable.  I  thank my  colleagues  Senators  CRAPO, BENNETand BARRASSO for joining me in this effort.  Mutual ditch and irrigation companies are primarily associations of farmers who band together to construct and  operate water delivery and storage systems  for use on semi-arid  farmland.  For 150 years, mutual ditch and irrigation  companies  have  installed  and  maintained this kind of infrastructure  to convey water to irrigated lands in  the West.  These companies can qualify for tax-  exempt status if at least 85 percent of  their income comes from their member  assessments. The  85-percent  rule  is  meant to ensure that the members of  tax-exempt cooperatives are not able  to enrich themselves by making investments unrelated  to  their charitable  purpose.  Over  time,  however,  the  cost  to  maintain and operate aging water infrastructure has made it impossible for  many mutual ditch and irrigation companies to operate solely on member income.  If member  assessments were  large enough to cover the true cost of  operations, it would be cost prohibitive  for most farmers to use the water to irrigate crops, leading to a loss of irrigated farmland.  To sustain irrigated farmland, ditch  and  irrigation companies supplement  the cost of operations with non-member  income  from,  for example,  recreational leases, crossing fees, storage  rights  and  the  exchange  of water  rights. This is a good thing, but this  supplemental  income  can  jeopardize  the company’s tax-exempt status.  My legislation would exempt certain  sources of income from the 85-percent  member income test for mutual ditch  and irrigation companies. However, to  be excluded, the revenue  from these  sources must be used for the tax-exempt purposes of the company. My legislation specifically requires non-member income to be used for operations or  maintenance of the mutual ditch or irrigation company in order to be exempted from the 85-percent test.  By excluding these revenue streams,  we can support local agriculture and  help ditch and  irrigation companies  stay  in business, while at the same  time providing for more efficient use of  precious water resources. Further, by  requiring that the proceeds be used exclusively  for operations and maintenance of the ditch or irrigation company, we will ensure that this income  is reinvested in water infrastructure,  helping to create and preserve rural  jobs and our agricultural heritage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 3650  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Staff Sergeant Battle lost his life  in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan on November 13, 2012, while trying to stop an explosion.  Staff Sergeant Battle was a native of Rocky  Mount, North Carolina, which  is  in my Congressional District. In 2005, he graduated from  Northern Nash High School and went on  to  enlist in the Army where he became a squad  leader  in  the 38th Engineer Company, 4th  Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2’ ’ Infantry Division.  Staff Sergeant Battle was a source of great  pride in his hometown because he epitomized  what it meant to serve with honor and distinction. This was demonstrated  in  the various  awards and decorations Staff Sergeant Battle  received during his career in the Army. Among  them include the Bronze Star Medal, the Army  Commendation Medal, two Army Achievement  Medals, two Army Good Conduct Medals, the  National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service  Star,  the  Iraq Campaign Medal with  three  Bronze Service Stars, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the NATO Medal.  In only 25 short years, Staff Sergeant Battle  accomplished more than most people do in a  full lifetime.  Unfortunately, Staff Sergeant Battle perished while serving his country—prematurely  ending a promising life and career. He is survived by his wife, Dorris Battle; his  father,  Rayvon Battle, Sr.; and his grandmother, Dora  Harris.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in offering heartfelt condolences to Staff Sergeant Battle’s family, and sincere appreciation  for his selfless efforts in defense of our great  nation. I pray that his life remains a source of  inspiration to the Rocky Mount community and  Americans nationwide. We are  forever  indebted to his family for the ultimate sacrifice  he paid on our behalf.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOSEPHINE MARTIN  HON. JAMES E.

Born December 6, 1912 in Montgomery,  South Carolina, Mrs. Martin has lived for over  eighty  years  in Columbia, where  she has  made such positive impacts on so many that  she is known to most—relatives and non-relatives alike—as ‘ ‘Mother Martin.’ ’  She and Mr. Willie Martin were united  in  Holy Matrimony on October 24, 1928, and  they remained married until his death in 1981.  Together  they had  ten  children, Florence,  James, Thomas, Charles, Curtis, Amanda, Will  Jr., Willie Mae, Gail, and Lorraine. Mrs. Martin  is now  the proud grandmother of 34, great-  grandmother of 70, and great-great-grandmother of 16. In the words of her family, ‘ ‘To  know mom is to know true love.’ ’  Mrs. Martin is a dedicated member of Mt.  Olive Baptist Church in Columbia, where she  has worshipped faithfully each week for more  than  fifty years. Her  favorite scripture  is  the  first verse of Psalm 91, ‘ ‘He who dwells in the  shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of  the Almighty.’ ’ Her  favorite hymn  is  ‘We’ve Come This Far By Faith. ’ ’ As she  completes a century on Earth, it is apparent  that she is the living embodiment of both.

483,House,112,-0.491,2,2012-12-11,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I come to  the floor very pleased that our Speaker  of  the  House, Mr.  has  brought the discussion of our  fiscal  challenges to this floor. Indeed, it is  long overdue. We have been calling  upon the Speaker to bring forth a middle-income tax cut now for a very long  time—in fact, since last summer when  it passed the United States Senate. The  President stands ready and poised with  his pen to sign it.  Democrats in the House have a discharge petition to bring that bill to the  floor. What stands in the way is an act  on the part of the Republican majority  to bring a middle-income tax cut to the  floor of the House, which across the  country has almost universal support  and which I think in this body, given  the right to vote for it, would have  overwhelming support.  Up until now, everybody in the country—in  fact,  in the world—has been  talking about what’s going to happen—  those who pay attention to such matters—what’s going to happen  in the  budget debate in the Congress and with  the President. At  last, that subject  comes to the floor.  b1210  What I would do to respond to what  the Speaker has said, though, is to set  the record straight. The fact is that  the  President  has,  and Democrats  agree with him, agreed to around $1.6  trillion in cuts in the Budget Control  Act and other acts of Congress in this  particular Congress,  $1.6  trillion  in  cuts. Where are the cuts? They’re in  bills that you, Mr. Speaker, have voted  for.  Secondly, on the issue of the entitlements with the Affordable Care Act  and with legislation, suggestions and  provisions in the President’s budget, it  amounts to over $1 trillion in savings  in Medicare, over $1 trillion in savings  which have been  redirected  to prolonging the life of Medicare, making it  stronger for nearly a decade while increasing benefits for our seniors and  those who depend on Medicare—not reducing but increasing benefits. There’s  been  a  massive  misrepresentation  about what that is, so I want to set the  record straight. So in terms of spending cuts, we are on the record having  voted for about $1.6 trillion.  In terms of entitlement reform, there  is over $1 trillion already and more  savings to be gained in further discussions on the subject by a strong down  payment.  What  is missing are two elements  that the President has put forth in his  budget: growth, investments in infrastructure—yes,  the  President  has  called  for  investments  in  infrastructure  to build  the  infrastructure of  America and to create jobs to grow our  economy; and, where are the revenues?  Where are the revenues? Regardless of  the cuts or the changes  in entitlements, more is demanded in terms of  what seniors would have to pay into  Medicare and at what age that would  happen, while the Republicans refuse  to touch one hair on the head of the  wealthiest people in our country.  The public overwhelmingly, 2–1, supports the President’s initiative for extending  the middle-income  tax cuts  whereby  100 percent—100 percent—of  U.S. taxpayers get a tax cut. Above  250—the  people making more  than  $250,000 a year would be asked to pay a  little more to contribute to the fiscal  soundness of our country, to pay our  bills, the defense of our country, the  support of our troops, the pillars of security for our seniors, the education of  our children and  the  safety of our  neighborhoods.  This is just asking them to pay a little bit more while they continue to get  the same tax cut that everyone does.  So it is 100 percent of the American  people get a tax cut, the upper 2 percent are asked to pay a little bit more.  So I thank the Speaker for finally at  least uttering the words on the floor of  the House about what the decisions are  that need to be made. Again, we have  committed to the cuts, we have acted  upon the entitlements, the President  has more  in his budget, all of this  would be a down payment for as we go  forward into the next session of Congress to talk about tax simplification  and fairness, how we can perhaps lower  rates while plugging up loopholes and  having a Tax Code that encourages  growth in our economy.  But that is a longer discussion as we  address the issue of how we strengthen  our entitlements not by diminishing  benefits but by getting more for what  we are spending. So if it’s Social Security, any changes in Social Security  should be left to strengthen Social Security. If it’s Medicare, any changes  should be there to strengthen Medicare, not to underwrite and subsidize  tax cuts for the wealthiest people in  our country.  So, again, I welcome the Speaker’s  statement that he wants to solve the  problem. The President has put forth  his budget, which has his initiative in  it. He has said that he’s willing to  make some changes. But it’s really important that any changes not hurt the  middle class. It comes right down to  this. Again, I’ve said, it’s not about the  price of the high-end tax cut, it’s about  the money that it generates. You can  find the money another way at the  high end. Let’s see what that discussion is. But it is not to burden the middle income in order to have bigger tax  cuts at the high end.  Those high-end  tax  cuts only  increase the deficit. They have not created  jobs. It’s simply unfair, and  it  doesn’t work. So hopefully the clock is  ticking, we’re getting closer  to  the  holidays, and that means closer to the  end of the year, which is fraught with  meaning in terms of time and the rest  of this. I don’t think there’s any reason  for us not to come to the table to make  an agreement to give confidence to  consumers in this holiday season and  to the markets at their end of year decisions  so  that we will  have  the  growth—the  growth,  the  jobs  that  produce revenue. That approach is the  way to create jobs to reduce the deficit.  We want to fix the deficit, grow the  economy, and do so  in a way that  makes responsible cuts and strong investments for our seniors and the pillars of economic security for them and  for their family. It is not a time to inject even more uncertainty  into the  lives of the American people and the  economy  of  our  country—and what  that means globally. It simply isn’t the  time. Many of these ideas are bad at  any  time,  but  they’re  particularly  harmful at this time.  So, again, I thank the Speaker for  bringing the issue finally to the floor  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:14 Dec 12, 2012 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11DE7.001 H11DEPT1 h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 7 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2012

Over  the years he has  practiced careful and productive stewardship  over our nation’s water and power resources.  His reverence  for our natural resources and  his commitment to public service have made  him an exceptional public servant. This January, Mr. Glaser will continue his efforts in Denver, Colorado, where he will work on several  high priority projects for the Bureau of Reclamation.  Mr. Glaser has over twenty years of experience with the Bureau of Reclamation, where  he has held a number of positions throughout  the West and Washington, D.C. He was recently honored with  the Department of  Interior’s highest  recognition,  the Distinguished  Service Award. He has been active  in non-  profits  engaged  in water  education,  open  space preservation, and fish and wildlife conservation and restoration. As Regional Director, Mr. Glaser oversaw  the management of  Reclamation’s water projects in an area that  encompasses the northern two-thirds of California, most of western Nevada, and part of  southern Oregon. His breadth of experience  has certainly been an asset to the Mid-Pacific  region.  The Central Valley Project (CVP) is perhaps  one of the most complicated and intricate federal water projects in the United States. Managing  the CVP requires delicately balancing  the often conflicting needs of farmers, ranchers, cities,  fish, wildlife,  tribal communities,  and recreational users. As the principal supervisor of projects like the CVP, Mr. Glaser consistently brought the skills necessary to troubleshoot problems. His expertise and ability to  foster  relationships helped  to address  the  competing needs of all water users, making  him a responsible guardian of one of our most  precious resources—water.  Mr. Glaser’s job called for the ability to address and resolve conflicts, and to understand  the nuances and sensitivities of the water resources  industry. He has demonstrated a  strong grasp of program planning, analysis,  policy formulation, and implementation, which  enabled him to represent the Department on  many difficult issues. Mr. Glaser ’s capacity to  balance  local  implications and  ‘the big picture’ ’ allows him to successfully create innovative solutions  to seemingly  impossible conflicts.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in recognizing Don Glaser for his tireless dedication  to being a conscientious keeper of  America’s water and power resources.

Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to  recognize and celebrate  the  life of Michael  Bowlds, my constituent and a man of unique  vision. Michael passed away last month after  a courageous battle with cancer. Even until his  final days, Michael worked tirelessly to make  a difference in the lives of others.  Michael was an award-winning sales, business  development,  and marketing  professional. A highly  regarded government contracting expert, he established Mountaintop  Marketing Group, one of the top government  marketing firms in the country.  Michael’s accomplishments as a business  leader were widely recognized. He was named  the 2009 ‘ ‘Advocate of the Year’ ’ by the U.S.  Department of Commerce’s Minority Business  Development Agency and commended for his  leadership, guidance and support in assisting  small and minority-owned firms with securing  over $200 million in government contracts in  that year alone. Nationally  recognized as a  leading Minority Business Champion, Michael  and Mountaintop Marketing Group hosted the  Annual Minority Business Awards Gala in conjunction with Congressional Black Caucus  Foundation. He was a recipient of the prestigious ‘ ‘Yeti Zanders Outstanding Advocate of  the Year ’ ’ Award presented by  the National  Capital Area Minority Business Opportunities  Center, selected as one of the ‘ ‘2010 Top 25  CEOs’ ’ by the Gazette of Business and Politics, and named one of the ‘ ‘50 Powerful Men  In Business’ ’ by the Minority Enterprise Executive Council.  Michael served as Board Chairman for the  National Capital Area Minority Business Opportunities Center Advisory Board and on the  Board of Directors of the Montgomery County  Chamber of Commerce, and was a founding  member and financial underwriter of the Montgomery County Chamber’s Government Contracting Network. He also served on the Board  of Directors  for  the National Women’s Business Center.  An active member of his community, Michael was deeply involved in mentoring small  businesses  through  the Montgomery County  Small Business Mentorship Program. He also  was a founding member and instructor of the  Montgomery Chamber of Commerce’s Veteran  Institute for Procurement.  I send my condolences to his wife Courtney,  his three children and his many friends and  colleagues throughout our community. He will  be deeply missed.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

488,House,112,-0.401,12,2012-12-19,Mr. SIRES.," Madam Speaker, it has  been nearly 8 weeks since Superstorm  Sandy  struck  our  shores  and  devastated an entire region. It has been 8  weeks, and Congress has yet to send a  disaster assistance package to the affected States.  It is precedent for this body to stand  together in the aftermath of a natural  disaster and to  immediately provide  the necessary assistance  in order to  help communities recover and rebuild.  Two weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit  the gulf coast, Congress approved more  than $62 billion  in Federal aid. One  month after Hurricanes Ike and Gustav  hit Texas, Congress  approved more  than $20 billion in aid.  Why can’t this Congress come together and approve the $60 billion requested by the President to help the  victims of Sandy? The damage done by  Sandy is far beyond the resources and  capacity that any single State possesses to recover on its own.

490,House,112,-0.382,33,2012-12-19,Ms. ESHOO.," I thank the gentleman.  Madam Speaker, I’m very proud to  rise in support of the PREEMIE Act  legislation that I introduced with Congressman LEONARDLANCE. He’s been a  terrific partner not only on this legislation but on other pieces of legislation  that we’ve moved through the Energy  and Commerce Committee, and I salute  him.  This bill will expand research, education,  and  prevention  of  preterm  birth. As the mother of two children, I  know how precious the earliest part of  life is, and it’s our responsibility to do  everything we can to make sure that  our little ones begin their lives with  more than a fighting chance.  Each year, as was stated, half a million babies are born prematurely in our  country, and preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn mortality and the  second-leading cause of  infant mortality. Babies born even a few weeks  too early can require weeks to months  of hospitalization after birth, and premature birth can sometimes lead to developmental delays and disability later  in life.  In addition  to  the emotional and  physical toll of prematurity, there are  significant health care costs to families, to our medical systems, and our  economy. A 2006 report by the Institute  of Medicine found the cost associated  with  preterm  birth  in  the United  States was $26.2 billion annually, or  $51,600 per infant born preterm. These  are  staggering  amounts  of  dollars.  While employers, private insurers, and  individuals bear about half of the cost  of health care for these infants, 40 percent is paid for by Medicaid. So it’s in  the best  interest of healthy babies,  hopeful families, and the budget of our  country to decrease preterm births.  The good news is our investment in  preventing prematurity is paying off.  In  2006,  I  introduced  and Congress  passed  the  first ever comprehensive  PREEMIE Act, and prematurity rates  have declined since then. This is very  good news. The better news  is that  today we’re  reauthorizing  this  law,  PITTS,  which will build upon the momentum  of the original law and provide us with  new tools and knowledge to improve  the lives and health of America’s mothers and children.  The PREEMIE Act has been packaged with other  important pediatric  health bills. I thank the chairman of  the  subcommittee, Mr.  the  chairman of our full committee, Mr.  UPTON, the ranking member of the full  committee, as well as Mr. PALLONE,  and all of our colleagues.  You know very well, Madam Speaker,  that we come to this place to do good  things  for  our  country  that  will  strengthen our Nation. How proud I am  that we are living up to that in presenting this bill here today.  In closing, I would also like to thank  Erin Katzelnick-Wise of my staff, who  has worked on this bill as if it were the  most important thing she could do in  her life, understanding that it is one of  the most important things she could do  in her life for children in our country;  to the American Academy of Pediatricians, who have been so magnificent in  instructing all of us in our work on  this legislation; and a particular shout-  out to Dr. Phil Pizzo, the dean of the  Stanford School of Medicine, a pediatrician himself who at one time worked  with great distinction at the National  Institutes of Health.  b1320  ",2012
491,House,112,0.602,47,2012-12-19,Mr. MARCHANT.," I rise to support  the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention  Act of 2012. This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would establish cost-  effective procedures to help protect the  identity of all seniors.  Seniors are a high-risk demographic  for  identity  theft.  Identity  thieves  have targeted seniors in my district in  Texas and across the country. This  year’s Centers  for Medicare Services  inspector general  report  found  that  more than a quarter million Medicare  beneficiaries have been potential victims of identity theft.  b1510  Most Medicare cards currently use  Social Security numbers as the identifier. By removing Social Security numbers  from Medicare  cards,  this bill  gives seniors the  identity protection  that they deserve. Seniors work their  entire lives for financial security, and  that security should not be jeopardized  due  to  preventable  identity  theft.  Other Federal programs and private insurance plans made similar changes  years ago, and Medicare beneficiaries  should have the same level of identity  protection and security.  I’m proud to support this legislation,  and I urge my colleagues to do so.  ",2012
492,House,112,0.402,61,2012-12-19,Mr. GALLEGLY.," I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of my legislation, H.R. 6587, to the designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 225 Simi Village  Drive in Simi Valley, California, as the  Postal Inspector Terry Asbury Post Office Building.  Terry Asbury was born in Superior,  Wisconsin, in 1950. Shortly after turning 18, he  joined the United States  Army and  served multiple  tours  in  Vietnam. After being honorably discharged in 1971, Terry began his career  in the United States Postal Service. He  worked out of the Van Nuys facility,  starting as a mail clerk and handler before moving up all the way to U.S.  postal inspector in 1986.  On Saturday, January 30, 1990, Inspector Asbury was returning in his vehicle after conducting an investigation  in the Los Angeles area when his vehicle was struck head-on by a van towing  a boat and a trailer. Four days later,  on February 3, he succumbed to his injuries, passing away at the early age of  39.  He was a loving husband and an exceptional person who went out of his  way to help others and make the world  a better place to live. I cannot see a  more  fitting way  to memorialize a  great American and  resident of my  hometown in Simi Valley, California,  than to dedicate this post office in his  honor.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ISSA,  Ranking Member CUMMINGS, and the  others for allowing me to bring this  bill to the floor today in such a quick  fashion, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.

493,House,112,-0.474,89,2012-12-19,Mr. RICHMOND.," I thank the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands for yielding and commend her on her passion as  a  physician  and  someone who has  taken an oath to preserve life and to  make sure that people can  live out  their years in a meaningful way and  die of natural causes.  I will just say that I’m from Louisiana, which our motto is we are the  sportsman’s paradise. We like to fish  and we like to hunt. We like to have a  fishing pole and we like to have a gun.  The difference is that the guns we use  and the guns that sportsmen use are rifles, and you don’t need high-capacity  magazines in order to hunt deer, to  hunt dove, to hunt ducks, to hunt rabbit. You just don’t do that.  I rise tonight in support of my colleagues  because,  especially  in  our  urban cities, we are  losing  far  too  many of our children, our fathers, our  mothers, our sisters, and our brothers  to gun violence. And every once in a  while, we’ll have an event that will  shake the confidence of our country  and make us take a step back and rationally look at our gun laws in this  country and say, Wait, we’ve done far  too much. We’ve expanded the Second  Amendment too far. The Founders of  the Constitution, when  the Second  Amendment was crafted, had no idea  that we would have AK–47s with clips  that can hold 50 rounds.  I can just tell you about an incident  in La Place, Louisiana, about 6 months  ago where a gentleman was denied benefits at an office and decided he was  going to his car and he was going to go  back inside. One of those Good Samaritans, an older lady, called the police  and said there was a man armoring up  in his car. State police and our sheriffs  responded to it and found the man in  his car. When they found him, he had  more ammunition in his trunk than  State police and our sheriffs put together. He had an AK–47, another rifle,  and so much ammunition.  But the scary part to that story, and  why this Good Samaritan was so key,  is when they arrested him, they went  to his apartment and he had a suicide  note there in his trailer. He had every  intention of making sure that he could  go in there and kill as many people as  he could, even if it meant him dying.  When the thugs and the criminals have  more guns and more ammunition than  our first responders, then we have a  problem.  In urban cities, when our kids have  better access to guns than textbooks,  then we’re a country that went wrong.

After 40 years with  NewsTalk WDBO as one of Central Florida’s  most respected and beloved news hosts, Jim  Turner has announced his plan to retire.  Mr. Turner joined WDBO in 1972 and has  hosted  the station’s morning segment since  1985. He is respected not only in the Central  Florida community but throughout the country.  In 2004 he was awarded by his peers in the  National Association of Broadcasters the prestigious Marconi Award  for Personality of  the  Year.  Founded  in 1924 as a physics project of  Rollins College, WDBO is today one of Central  Florida’s great news and  talk radio stations.  During his tenure as the morning show host,  Turner headed  the  station ’s  transformation  from music to information and talk.  Jim Turner ’s daily presence on WDBO’s  morning  talk segment will be sorely missed.  We are grateful  for  the years he has spent  talking with Central Florida, and we wish him  well.  f  RECOGNIZING ROBERT J.

Mr. Page was a community leader and philanthropist who helped organize Franklin Bank  and Trust and served as chairman of  the  bank’s board of directors for 45 years.  In his 90 years of  life, Mr. Page helped  open and lead what became the largest bank  in Franklin, Kentucky, an area I have the privilege of representing in the First Congressional  District of Kentucky.  Mr. Page was active  in all  facets of  the  community. He was instrumental in industrial  development in Franklin and Simpson County  and was active in various community organizations. Having served as President for both  the Franklin-Simpson Chamber of Commerce  and the Franklin Rotary Club, Mr. Page also  helped  organize  the Caveland Girl Scout  Council and was treasurer of the Quarterback  Club.  Leon Page served on the Kentucky Bankers  Association and various boards and councils  at Western Kentucky University. He also established a scholarship fund at Western Kentucky University that awards a four-year scholarship  to a Franklin-Simpson High School  graduate who majors in business each year.  I join the family, friends, and entire Franklin,  Kentucky community in mourning the passing  of this great man. He demonstrated the best  of the values found throughout the First Congressional District of Kentucky. He is someone  who, despite his personal success, will best  be remembered as inspiring and helping guide  others to achieve success for themselves, and  a man who graciously gave back to a community that had given him so much.  f  TRIBUTE TO ABRAM ‘‘CAPTAIN’’  COLES, JR.

497,,112,0.257,187,2012-12-19,Mr. RIVERA.," Mr. Speaker, like so many others, I ran for Congress because I believe in  the greatness of the American people, the nobility of our national ideals, and the eminence  of our principles and rights  that have made  America that shining city upon a hill.  But there are still many peoples who yearn  for  freedom and basic human  liberties. The  Sahrawi people of Western Sahara have been  trapped in dreadful and oppressive conditions  for over thirty years with the support and enabling of a compromised and corrupt Algerian  government  and  its  puppet  regime,  the  Polisario Front.  The Polisario instituted mass kidnappings of  Sahrawis from their homes into the Tindouf region in Western Algeria. The majority of these  refugees have remained warehoused and imprisoned in Tindouf’s sprawling camps for 35  years.  The Polisario partners and collaborates with  the  likes of Cuba, whose military distributes  food in the camps on a quid pro quo basis  and  ‘educates’ ’ children who have been reportedly stolen  from  their parents, and Al-  Qaeda in the Maghreb.  The Government of Morocco has advanced  an Autonomy Plan  that does address  these  issues and provides a clear, simple,  transparent and democratic solution  to  the  long  drawn out Sahara crisis. This is where America’s support should lie.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. ANIMAL WELFARE.  Section 2(h) of the Animal Welfare Act (7  U.S.C. 2132(h))  is amended by adding  ‘‘an  owner of a common, domesticated household  pet who derives less than a substantial portion of income from a nonprimary source (as  determined by the Secretary) for exhibiting  an animal that exclusively resides at the residence of the pet owner,’’ after ‘‘stores,’’.

504,,112,0.425,102,2012-12-31,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I submit  the following.  SECTION-BY-SECTIONSUMMARY  (a) Advice of Counsel. The AIA’s section 17  created a new §298 of title 35 that bars the  use of evidence of an accused infringer’s failure to obtain advice of counsel, or his failure  to waive privilege and introduce such opinion, to prove either willfulness or intent to  induce  infringement. Section 17, however,  neglected to specify when this new authority  became effective. As a result, §298 is subject  to the default effective date at section 35 of  the AIA, and applies only to patents issued  one year or later after enactment of the AIA.  This subsection makes §298 applicable to all  civil actions commenced after the enactment  of this Act.  (b) Transitional Program for CBMs. This  subsection corrects two scrivener’s errors in  section 18 of the AIA. These changes have no  substantive effect.  (c) Joinder of Parties. This subsection corrects a scrivener’s error in the new §299 of  title 35. This change has no substantive effect.  (d) Dead Zones. This subsection fixes two  provisions that inadvertently make it impossible to seek either post-grant or inter partes  review of a patent during certain time periods. Section 311(c) of title 35 bars anyone  from seeking inter partes review of a patent  during the first nine months after the patent  issues, or until a post-grant review of a patent is completed if such review is instituted.  Section 311(c) was intended to preclude challengers from using IPR during the period  when they can instead use PGR. The problem  with the provision is that, during Senate  floor consideration of the AIA in March 2011,  another provision was added to the bill via  the managers’ amendment that allows only  first-to-file patents to be challenged in PGR.  This provision, at section 6(f)(2)(A) of the  AIA, was intended to allow USPTO a longer  period  to  prepare  to  conduct PGR  proceedings, and to exclude patents that raise  discovery-intensive invention-date and loss-  of-right-to-patent  issues  from PGR. However, §311(c) takes effect and applies to all  petitions for IPR that are filed on or after  September 16, 2012. Yet  for several years  thereafter, almost all patents that are issued  will  still be  first-to-invent patents. And  under §311(c) of title 35, these patents cannot  be challenged  in  IPR during  the  first  9  months after their issuance, while under section 6(f)(2) of the AIA, these patents cannot  be challenged in PGR. Paragraph (1) eliminates this nine month ‘‘dead zone’’ by making §311(c) inapplicable to patents that are  first-to-invent patents and are thus  ineligible for PGR.  Paragraph (2) addresses another dead zone  that  is unique to reissue patents. Under  §311(c) of title 35, IPR cannot be sought during the nine months after a patent is reissued. This limit was imposed in order to  force challengers to bring a PGR challenge  (rather than IPR) against what is, in effect,  a new patent. However, §325(f) of title 35  then bars a challenge to any claim in a reissue patent that is ‘‘identical’’ to or ‘‘narrower’’ than the claims in the original patent. As a result, such ‘‘identical’’ or ‘‘narrower’’ claims could not be reviewed in either a PGR or an  IPR during  the nine  months after a reissue. Paragraph (2) eliminates this dead zone by repealing section  311(c)(1)’s limit on filing a petition for inter  partes review after a patent has been reissued.  (e)  Correct  Inventor.  This  subsection  amends the authorization of settlement in  derivation proceedings to refer to ‘‘correct  inventor’’ in the singular, out of recognition  of the fact that it is the entire inventive entity that must be named in the settlement  agreement. This change has no substantive  effect.  (f) Required Oath. Paragraph (1) liberalizes  the time allowed for an applicant to file the  required oath or alternative statement, allowing him to file as late as payment of the  issue fee (rather than requiring filing prior  to  allowance).  Paragraph  (2)  corrects  §115(g)(1) by using ‘‘that claims’’ rather than  ‘‘who claims,’’ since the antecedent for these  words is ‘‘application’’ rather than ‘‘inventor.’’ Paragraph  (2)’s change has no substantive effect. (USPTO requests.)  (g) Travel Expenses and Payment of Administrative Judges. Section 21 of the AIA,  which makes minor changes to the law regarding the compensation of USPTO employees for travel and the payment of APJs, was  not given its own effective date. This subsection makes  these  provisions  effective  upon enactment of the AIA.  (h) Patent Term Adjustments. This subsection clarifies and  improves certain requirements for seeking patent-term adjustments. These changes allow USPTO to provide notice of its PTA determination at the  same time as the grant of a patent, and effectively require an applicant who wishes to  pursue a civil action under paragraph (4)(A)  of §154(b) to exhaust remedies provided under  paragraph 3(B)(ii). These changes are minor,  and only apply prospectively to PTAs that  are determined and to §154(b)(4)(A) actions  that are commenced after the enactment of  this Act. (USPTO request.)  The Committee is aware that the district  court for the Eastern District of Virginia, on  November 1 of this year, issued a decision in  the case of Exelixis v. Kappos that appears  to have adopted a highly problematic interpretation of the patent term adjustment allowed by §154(b)(1)(B). For reasons that remain unclear, the court concluded that continuations and other events described in the  ‘‘not including’’ clauses of that subparagraph  should not be excluded from the subparagraph’s calculation of patent term adjustment, but instead must be read only to toll  the three-year clock that determines when  patent term adjustment begins to accrue  under subparagraph (B). The district court’s  interpretation  of  subparagraph  (B)  thus  would allow patent term adjustment to accrue for any continued examination sought  after the three-year clock has run. Such a result, of course, would allow applicants to  postpone  their  patent’s  expiration  date  through dilatory prosecution, the very submarine-patenting  tactic  that  Congress  sought to preclude in 1994 when it adopted a  20-year patent term that runs from an application’s effective filing date.  Despite the absurd and undesirable results  that would appear to flow from the district  court’s  interpretation, the Committee declines to address this matter at this time.  This case was brought to the Committee’s  attention only very recently, precluding the  thorough  consideration  and  consultation  that is appropriate before legislation is enacted. Moreover, Congress is not in the business of immediately amending the United  States Code in response to every nonfinal  legal error made by a trial court. The Committee, of course, reserves the right to address this matter in the future. In the meantime, the fact that the present bill does not  amend §154(b) to address the Exelixis decision should not be construed as congressional acquiescence in or agreement with the  reasoning of that decision.  (i) Improper Applicant. This subsection repeals an unnecessary limitation on who may  file an international application designating  the United States. (USPTO request.)  (j) Financial Management Clarifications.  This  subsection makes  several  technical  changes to §42 of title 35, concerning USPTO  funding. These changes: (1) ensure that the  rule requiring that patent fees be spent for  patent purposes also applies to RCE fees; and  (2) ensure that all USPTO administrative  costs will be covered by either patent fees or  trademark fees. (USPTO request.)  (k) Derivation Proceedings. Currently, the  third sentence of §135(a) will allow a derivation proceeding to be sought only within the  year after the victim’s claim that has been  the target of derivation has published. It is  possible, however, that a deriver could file  first, but delay claiming the derived material until more than a year has elapsed after  the victim’s claims have published, in other  words, until after the current deadline has  lapsed. The changes made by this subsection  preclude such a scenario by requiring the  proceeding to be sought during the year after  the publication of the deriver’s claim to the  invention. These changes also add a definition of ‘‘earlier application’’ to §135(a), correct inconsistencies in the AIA’s version of  §135(a), and authorize the PTAB to conduct,  and the courts to hear appeals of,  interferences commenced after the effective date  of the AIA’s amendments to §135(a).

Romain selflessly served  our community for over 65 years through his  medical practice and will be remembered as a  good friend to many, and a fixture on the sidelines at the local college and high school football games.  Born  in Bakersfield  to French  immigrants,  Romain attended Kern County Union High  School, Bakersfield Junior College, the University of California at Berkeley, and Creighton  Medical School in Nebraska before serving in  the U.S. Navy’s 41st Seabees during the Second World War.  In 1946, after the war had passed, Romain  set up his medical practice  in Bakersfield.  Throughout  the  following decades, he would  become well-regarded for his constant availability and the personal attention given to each  of his patients. Dr. Clerou  treated countless  ailments, delivered thousands of babies, and  befriended generations of families.  Additionally, Romain was the beloved team  doctor for many athletes on Bakersfield football teams, a service for which he was known  to never charge. Romain loved sports. He was  a gymnast and football player and continued  to play competitive rounds of golf up until late  February of this year. Only a few months ago,  Romain could be found at Bakersfield College  taking in a football practice, sitting in a golf  cart and smoking the cigars he was so well  known for.  Mr. Speaker, it is this kind of dedication to  community service that reflects the great characteristics of our nation’s people. As someone  who lived life to the fullest and spent most of  that  life serving  the people of Bakersfield,  Romain was not only a pillar of strength to his  community, but also to his country. He is survived by Mrs. Mayie Maitia, along with her  family, his six children, and five grandchildren.  While I ask that my colleagues join me today  in honoring the life of a great American, I have  no doubt that Dr. Romain Clerou will be long  remembered by the community he served so  well.
