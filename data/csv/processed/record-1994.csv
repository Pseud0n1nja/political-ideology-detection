6,House,103,0.043,97,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for yielding. I want to  commend  the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. MOAKLEY]  for giving us  an opportunity to reflect on the public  service of a great man, a great Speak er, Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill.  Speaker Tip O'Neill left his mark not  only on our Nation, but virtually on all  of us. on both sides of the aisle, who  served with him in the Congress.  I had the privilege of serving in the  House with Tip during the last 14 years  of his public service.  Tip always had  a  good word  and  sound advice for all of us as he helped  to enhance the reputation of this great  body.  I along with many of our colleagues  will long remember Tip's good humor,  his warmth  for  his  colleagues,  his  touching renditions of ""Danny Boy,""  his bear hugs for our spouses, and his  Solomon-like leadership in conducting  the business and judiciously moderat ing  the  rancorous  debates  of  this  House.  Some observers have called him the  last of the old time politicians and, at  the same time, the first of the new po litical leaders. His colorful style and  his strong convictions made him an ad mired effective leader.  ""Tip"" O'Neill had a framed saying on  the wall of his office which proclaimed  that the main responsibilities of Gov ernment were to take care of people at  the dawn of life-our children, at the  twilight of  life-our senior  citizens,  and in the shadows of life-the ill, the  needy. and the handicapped.  We will long remember and long miss  this giant of a man.  ",1994

8,House,103,-0.346,97,1,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  remember another Speaker,  and a dear friend, Tip O'Neill. I know I  express what  is  in  so many of our  hearts when I say that not one person  who served with Tip was untouched by  his warmth, his humor, and his kind ness.  Tip O'Neill was a special kind of pub lic servant. He took tremendous joy in  the game of politics. But he respected no, he revered-the institutions of our  democratically elected, representative  government. Rough and tumble as this  House can be at times-and rough and  tumble as Tip himself could play-Tip  79--059  0-97 Vol. 140 (Pt. I) 4  never forgot  that this is the people's  House. Our business  is  the public's  business; our mission the public good.  Tip knew in his bones that our U.S.  Government was of the people, by the  people, and for the people. And people  weren't some  abstraction. Economic  statistics weren't people. Long-term  projections weren't people. Pie charts  and bar charts and flow charts weren't  people.  People were the men and women he  met everyday-whether he met them in  the marble Halls of the Congress or on  the  streets  and  sidewalks  of Cam bridge. His mission was to do the best  he could for  them, and to make sure  that Government existed to serve them  and their needs.  Tip's kindness was legendary. I my self arrived in Washington after a spe cial election. I was the single-most jun ior Member. But Tip made it his busi ness not only to welcome me, but to  get to know me.  Because Tip loved people, he listened  to them. We know that he listened to  his  own  children  enough  to  believe  them about the Vietnam war, and to  oppose a President of his own party as  a result. He listened to the new Mem bers of Congress after the watershed  election of 1974, and so was able not  only to recognize, but to be part of the  changes that swept the Congress. And  he  listened  to his colleagues and his  constituents, and so was able to be a  successful and beloved Speaker.  His love of people infused all his rela tionships, and no one who served with  Tip will ever forget his warmth. I will  miss him enormously. Thank you, dear  friend of Speaker O'Neill-JOE MOAK LEY.

9,House,103,-0.215,97,1,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  say a few words about Tip O'Neill.  Tip left Congress 7 years ago, much  longer ago than it seems. It's almost a  shock to think about. Measured by a  congressional timeframe, 7 years is al most an eternity. Here in the House we  get things done, put them behind us,  and move on to the next thing-we do  it over and over again. The years can  seem like a headlong rush with Ii ttle  chance  to  look back and  ruminate.  Things  change  fast while we're  im mersed in the daily  tussle and wran gling our work propels us into. Even  between sessions our time and energy  is occupied with work back  in  the  home district.  When Tip  stepped down  from  the  Speaker's chair we said our farewells- and hit  the ground  running. He had  been Speaker for 10 years and had left  his indelible mark on this institution,  but we still had the work of Congress  to do. We didn't look back for  long.  More  than most  things  could, Tip  O'Neill's death stopped us cold.  Those still here  today who worked  with him or against him have  their  personal memories of the man. As an  institution we have his portrait hang ing as a memento. There are  the ac counts and testaments of his career re cently  published  in  newspapers  and  magazines, broadcast on radio and tele vision, and recorded in our own CON GRESSIONAL RECORD.  Sad as it may seem, as time passes  all that will remain of the man who we  remember  so vividly and personally  will be these sort of public records. He  will become part of our Nation's public  history, a sort of collective identity,  remembered the same way we remem ber a Longworth or Sam Rayburn.  However, his presence as a man and  his life's work will live on with a vigor  and vitality  rarely achieved by any  man or woman. Who he was, what he  believed, and how he expressed it lies  encoded  in  the House of Representa tives as it exists today and in the pub lic laws of the land. The man he actu ally was has become an actual part of  collective  political  identity  reem bodied every time we come together for  business.  It may be an anonymous,  more diffuse existence, but Tip O'Neill  hasn't stopped being with us since he  left 7 years ago.  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  KLINK). Without objection,  the gen tleman  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  FRANK]  is recognized for an additional  60 minutes.  ",1994
10,House,103,-0.547,97,1,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I,  too,  would  like  to add my praise  to my  chairman, the gentleman from Massa chusetts [Mr. MOAKLEY] for his eulogy  and his celebratory tone and his cap turing of the man at Tip's funeral. It  was an incredibly moving experience to  hear him and Tip's son.  I got to know Tip in a very strange  way. I would like  to share that with  my colleagues, if I could, for just a sec ond.  When I got here in 1976-1977, Tip had  just become Speaker.  I was advised  that a good way to learn how this place  worked would be to go the whip meet ings down  in Congressman Brademus'  office, which is my office now. And I  felt, as a new freshman, really uncom fortable and out of place and wondering  what this place was all about.  I would wander down  there, and  I  would bring a newspaper and kind of  sit in the corner. And Tip would be sit ting up front, and he would also be  reading the newspaper. He had that big  stogie in his mouth, and it occurred to  him, at one point, that we were reading  the same part of the newspaper. We  were both reading the sports section.  Eventually, he figured out that I was  reading the same part of the sport sec",1994
11,House,103,-0.766,110,1,Mr. WASHINGTON.," Mr. Speaker, as I  ponder  the  President's possible  re marks later this evening on the State  of the Union, I thought it was impor tant to discuss some  things that ad dress what I believe will be the prin cipal  subject of  the President's re marks.  I am happy that several of my col leagues who preceded me on the micro phone  today have seen fit  to address  some of these issues. It seems to me,  and what I read in the paper suggests,  that the President will deal principally  with the issue of crime in America, the  reform of our health care system and  welfare reform.  I wonder if we in the Congress have  the  collective  courage,  the  strength  and  the statesmanship  to rededicate  ourselves to true reform. For true re form is what is necessary.  Some  of  the  problems  that prin cipally beset us are crime, health care  and welfare reform. These are problems  that concern all Americans. Any poll  that is taken indicates that these are  the principal issues, concerns and wor ries in the hearts and in the minds of  the American people.  As  the gentleman from Texas, who  immediately preceded me to the micro phone,  indicated,  it depends on how  you look at the statistics as to what  they show you.  The statistics recently  released by  the Federal Bureau of  Investigation  show that America's crime rate for the  last 2 years actually declined by 5 per cent. The last 2 years was the only pe riod in the last 50 years in which the  Congress of the United States did not  pass a crime bill. So one could say that  during the 2-year period when Congress  did not pass a crime bill was the only  time  in  the  last 50 years when  the  crime rate went down.  So if we really want the crime rate to  go down, we need to stop the Congress  from passing crime bills, because most  of what they are used for is re-election  of Members of Congress. Most of what  the crime bills are used for is the re election of the Members of Congress.  They make wonderful commercials.  They look good on your resume. They  are wonderful for television, where you  can show yourself slamming the bars  on some prison, but you fail to tell the  citizens out  there who are going  to  vote for you how much you are costing  them.  Some of my friends are in favor of  the ""lock them up and throw the key  away"" approach. Some of my friends  are in favor of assisting the States by  building  regional prisons. But  if my  friend, who  immediately preceded me  to the microphone, would have his way,  the gentleman from Texas [Mr. CHAP MAN], we would require the States to  impose upon their court system the re quirement that 85 percent of a sentence  be served.  We are not going to pay for it. The  States are going to have to pay for it.  And in these days when most of us are  speaking  about  unfunded mandates,  here is another mandate.  Now, we really do need to do some thing about crime. But the States can  do much more about crime  than the  Federal Government,  and  I  do  not  think they need our help. What we like  to help  them do  is  to run over each  other getting to a microphone so we  can tell the citizens how much we have  done  to protect  them, how much we  have done about crime, so that we can  get re-elected.  D 1520  Statistics of whether crime has de creased mean absolutely nothing. As I  say, in the last 2 years crime has de creased by 5 percent, according to FBI  statistics, but I don't know any people  who  are  comforted by  that because  they are still afraid to walk the streets  in the daytime and at night. Now they  are afraid to go to the shopping malls.  They are afraid to ride on the public  transportation  systems.  They  are  afraid to send their children to school.  Yet they are being told by the FBI that  the crime statistics have gone down in  the last 2 years by 5 percent.  I do not know any people anywhere  in America who are not afraid or have  an  all-permeating  fear  of  drive-by  shootings and  random violence,  and  children being caught in the crossfire  of automatic and semiautomatic weap ons. The increase in the sale of burglar  alarms and personal defense  devices  will tell us that people are afraid.  People want something done about  crime, but they are tired of paying to  have something done about crime that  does not do  anything  about  crime.  They have been paying out of the nose,  they have been paying out of the pock et,  they have been paying out of the  ears, been paying out of everywhere  that they can pay for the last 50 years  of Congress to come up and engage in  an exercise in futility, because we are  not solving the problem.  If every violent criminal in America  today were locked up and put in prison,  we would be  safe  for a  little while.  However, because we do not do any thing about the people who are 17 and  16 and 15 and 14 and 13, if we locked up  everybody that was over 17 who com mitted a violent crime for the rest of  their life, and we do nothing more than  what we are doing now for the people  who are 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and  16 and 17,  in 2 years or 3 years or 4  years we will be right back where we  started, except we will have a whole lot  more prisons built.  Mr. Speaker,  these prisons are not  cheap. The average cost to build one  cell in which two or three or four per sons may be housed is $100,000. It costs  us $100,000 each time we build another  maximum security cell  in which we  can lock up these violent criminals. A  lot of them need to be locked up. That  is not the point of my discussion here  today.  In addition to that $100,000  to build  this house in which we can house up to  four of these  individuals, we pay the  princely sum of $25,000 per year  for  every year they are locked up for the  rest of their lives. So if we take some body who  is 20, who  is going  to die  when he is 70, we are going to spend 50  years at $25,000  keeping  that person  locked up in prison. They do not even  have to pay for their own keep.  We want  to  do  something  about  crime. We are afraid. There is at least  a perception that crime has gone out of  control. Crime  is hemorrhaging our  country to the tune of $470 billion per  year. We must have a  response. The  present response is not working.  The other body has passed a crime  bill in which they were able to find $22  billion to pay for prisons when just last  year, in the same year when they found  $22  billion  to pay  for prisons,  they  could not find $10 billion  to pay for  Head Start, Healthy Start, and sum mer jobs for some of the same people  who are now incarcerated in prison.  Since June 1993,  the chairman,  the  gentleman from Michigan, JOHN CON YERS;  the gentleman  from Virginia,  ROBERT  SCOTT;  the gentleman  from  North Carolina, MEL WATT;  the gen tleman  from  California,  XAVIER  BECERRA;  the gentleman from Califor nia, DON EDWARDS; and I, along with  many other Members of various inter est groups and caucuses, organizations  and groups, have been  crafting and  drafting a realistic, humanistic, doable  approach  to  the problem of crime  in  America.

12,,103,-0.316,136,1,Mr. BARLOW.," Mr. Speaker, today  I rise to  announce  the  introduction of  the Education  Savings Assistance Act of 1994. I am honored  that my colleague from Kentucky, Representa tive ScoTIY BAESLER  is a cosponsor of this  measure.  The ability of Americans to provide for our  children's college or advanced vocational edu cation  has  declined  significantly  in  recent  years due  to escalating college  tuition ex penses and cutbacks  in Federal student aid.  This trend has occurred at a time when ad vanced education is becoming more important  if our children are to compete in a more com petitive economy.  In 1988, the Commonwealth of Kentucky es tablished  the Kentucky Educational Savings  Plan Trust [KESPT] in order to provide parents  with assistance in saving for their children's fu ture. To  further  this goal, Kentucky enacted  legislation  that enables parents  to establish  special education savings accounts. This leg islation also provides  tax-free  treatment  for  any gains earned on these accounts, and al lows parents to lock-in tuition rates at current  levels  for Kentucky colleges and universities  that participate in the program. While the plan  is still  in  its  infancy,  there  is general agree ment that it is a resounding success.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In  this era of budget discipline and  in creased personal  responsibility, and with our  Nation  facing  an  increasingly  competitive  world, it is just plain good common sense that  we should provide assistance  in  the  form of  Federal  tax  incentives so  that we assist our  citizens  in  improving  their skills for the high technology, highly skilled work  force of  the  next century. This  legislation that I am  intro ducing today will provide a Federal tax exemp tion  for gains earned on qualified State edu cational savings programs similar to the pro gram established by Kentucky. This legislation  will encourage parents to plan ahead  for the  benefit of their children and improve the over all savings rate for our Nation that has signifi cantly declined in recent years.  I urge all Members of both parties to sup port this legislation as it proceeds through the  legislative process.  CONGRATULATIONS TO KEVIN  CHIARAMONTE, EAGLE SCOUT  HON. THOMASJ.MANTON  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 1994  ",1994
13,,103,-0.361,136,1,Mr. MANTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  congratulate 19-year-old Kevin Chiaramonte of  Middle Village, NY,  for achieving  the highest  honor in Scouting, becoming an Eagle Scout.  To become an Eagle Scout, one must meet  a number of requirements. These  include at taining 20 merit badges and displaying leader ship in school, Scouting, and the community.  Kevin has demonstrated his  leadership abili ties not only in the Scouting community, but in  the social and educational communities as  well.  Kevin was born  in Brooklyn, NY, and at tended elementary school at St. Margaret's in  Middle Village, NY, and continued at the Regis  High School where he received a full scholar ship. While in these two institutions of learning  he  took part  in chorus, drama, high school  C.C.D. programs, and of course, Boy Scouts.  Currently, he  is working  toward  receiving his  bachelors degree from Boston University.  Kevin's Scouting career consisted of 5 years  in Cub Scouts and 7 years as a Boy Scout.  While in the Scouting program he has held nu merous  leadership positions,  including patrol  leader, assistant senior patrol  leader, senior  patrol  leader, and quartermaster. He has re ceived  2  religious  awards,  over  21 merit  badges, and 11 skill awards while a Scout and  has received the highest Scouting honor Eagle  Scout this past July. I know my colleagues will  join me  in congratulating Kevin on becoming  an Eagle Scout.  THE 1994 KING HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE:  ""STOP  THE  KILLING;  START  THE  HEALING  AND  BUILDING""  HON. THOMAS C. SAWYER  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 1994  ",1994
14,,103,-0.377,136,1,Mr. SAWYER.," Mr. Speaker,  last week we  observed the 65th anniversary of the birth of  January 25, 1994  one of America's greatest leaders, Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr.  The King holiday provides us with  the op portunity  to  renew our commitment  to Dr.  King's dream of achieving peace,  racial har mony, cultural tolerance, and equality of eco nomic opportunity.  The observance of Dr. King's birthday is co ordinated  through  the  tireless efforts of  the  Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal Holiday Com mission, on which I have the pleasure of serv ing. In addition to promoting the King holiday,  the Commission has devoted countless hours  to passing on Dr. King's legacy and teachings  to our children, who will shape the  future of  the community of nations.  With  its  limited resources,  the Commission  sponsors activities throughout the year aimed  at combating violence, crime, drugs, and  illit eracy, as well as promoting voter registration  and urban economic development. The Com mission also places a heavy emphasis on  educating our young people about alternatives  to violence and crime and teaching them the  skills they need to settle disputes and conflicts  nonviolently.  If Dr. King were here today, what would he  think of our society and our world? Conditions  have improved since his untimely death. How ever, we continue to grapple with issues such  as racism,  the lack of affordable health care,  and senseless acts of violence that are grow ing at an alarming pace.  I believe that it is time for all of us to prac tice the politics of inclusion, so that Americans  of all  races  and  ethnic backgrounds may  share  in  the challenge of economic recovery  and social healing.  That  is why  I sponsored the ""King Holiday  and Service Act,"" along with a good  friend,  Congressman  JOHN  LEWIS of Georgia. The  Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal Holiday Com mission  is scheduled  to expire  in April. H.R.  1933 would extend the life of the Commission  for 5 years.  I believe  that enactment of  this  legislation is necessary because the Commis sion still has an important role to play in mak ing  the King holiday a meaningful and  inclu sive observance for all Americans.  TRIBUTE  TO  ALEXANDER  J.  HEBERT,  RETIRING  VETERANS'  EMPLOYMENT REPRESENTATIVE  HON. DICK swm  OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 1994  ",1994
15,,103,-0.385,149,1,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  take this opportunity to express my personal  gratitude to all of the pages who have served  so diligently in the House of Representatives  during the 103d Congress.  We all recognize the important role that con gressional pages play in helping the House of  Representatives operate. This group of young  people, who come from all across our Nation,  represent what is good about our country. To  become a page,  these young people have  proven  themselves  to be academically quali fied. They have ventured away from the secu rity of their homes and families to spend time  in an unfamiliar city. Through this experience,  they have witnessed a new culture, made new  friends, and  learned  the details of how our  Government operates.  As we all know, the job of a congressional  page  is not an easy one. Along with being  away from home, the pages must possess the  maturity  to balance competing demands  for  their time and energy.  In addition,  they must  have  the dedication  to work  long hours and  the ability to interact with people at a personal  level. At the same time, they face a challeng ing  academic  schedule  of  classes  in  the  House Page School.  The  fall  1993 class of pages witnessed  many important and historical events and de bates,  including  the North American Free Trade Agreement,  the Brady bill, and PresiEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dent Clinton's address  to Congress and  the  Nation on his health care reform proposal. The  pages also witnessed  the ceremonies com memorating the return of the Statue of Free dom to the Capitol dome.  I am sure they will  consider their time spent in Washington, DC to  be one of the most valuable and exciting ex periences of their lives, and. that with this ex perience they will all move ahead to lead suc cessful and productive lives.  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of  the House  Page Board, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring  this group of distinguished young  Americans. They certainly will be missed:  DEPARTING PAGES: FALL 1993-94  Yoeli Barag  Brian Brookshire  Justin Brown  Christopher Carmody  Kit Cavender  Carolyn Cavener  Catherine Chacon  Robert Dominquez  Erin Doty  Michael Dunlap  Malinda Emahiser  Patrice Frey  Joy Fulton  Alexis Halpern  Brent Herrera  Flannery Higgins  James Kisner  Richard Kwiatkowski  Prince LeBoo  Jesus (Jesse) Lopez  Maricella Loza  Sara Mohoney  Chad Marshall  Richard McGuire  Jorie Mead  Kathryn  Montgomery  Mary Newman  Elizabeth Nguyen  Susan Oliver  Christine Paces  Lindsay Petrie  Marissa Pyle  Rory Quintana  Nathan Ramsey  Mathew Ringler  John Riordan  Odessa Roberts  Michelle Ryan  Taraneh Shadzi  Dana Snyder-Camp  Scott Wagner  Sean Williams  Marissa Woodring  Mark Wright  Aaron Wynn  A WELL DESERVED  COMMUNITY  TRIBUTE FOR DR.

16,House,103,0.316,162,1,Mr. RAMSTAD.," Mr. Speaker, a year  ago at the dawn of a new Presidential  administration,  Americans  eagerly  awaited  enactment of  the  promised  middle-income tax cut.  We all know what happened.  No  tax cut. Instead, retroactive tax  increases-even on the dead.  I am sure  if Members of this body  were asked a  year ago  today.  ''Are  taxes going to be raised retroactively  back to the Bush administration?,"" all  of us would have said ""No.""  Yet,  that is exactly what Congress  did.  This  should  never  happen  again.  That's why I introduced House Resolu tion 247, which would amend the House  Rules  to establish a  point of order  against considering any measure that  contains a retroactive tax increase.  Even  though House Resolution 247  has been cosponsored by 135 Members  from both sides of the aisle, the Rules  Committee has refused to hold a hear ing on this resolution.  Accordingly,  I have been compelled  to file a discharge petition. I urge all of  my colleagues, Democrats and Repub licans alike, to sign it today.  Let us abolish retroactive taxes.  COMMENTS ON DR. RICHARD V.  MOORE  (Ms. BROWN of Florida asked and  was given permission  to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",1994
17,House,103,-0.429,162,1,Ms. BROWN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in honor of the  life and  work of Dr. Richard Moore who died on  January 2, 1994, at the age of 88. Dr.  Moore was the third president of Be thune Cookman College  in Daytona  Beach, FL, which is in my district. Be thune Cookman College was founded in  1904, by Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune to  serve  the needs of the African-Amer 'ican community in Florida.  Dr. Moore was born on November 20,  1906,  in Quincy, FL. He  earned his  bachelors degree  from Knoxville Col lege in 1932, and a masters degree from  Atlanta University in 1944. Early in his  distinguished career, Dr. Moore became  the first African-American to serve as  the Florida Department of Education's  State  supervisor of black  secondary  schools, a position previously held only  by whites. He held this post until Be thune Cookman lured him to Daytona  Beach. Dr. Moore served as president of  the college from 1947 to 1975. During his  tenure, Bethune Cookman became fully  accredited,  full  time  enrollment  in creased by more  than 1,000 students,  and he more than tripled the size of the  school's endowment fund.  Dr. Moore inspired the lives of thou sands  of African-American  students  and an entire community. He consid ered his greatest achievement as pro viding  educational  opportunities  for  young men and women. Dr. Moore once  said: ""I have the responsibility to my self, my family, my country, and my  God to so live as to make this world a  better place by my having lived here.""  He lived by these words.  STAND AND DELIVER  (Mr. BALLENGER  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1994
18,House,103,0.464,162,1,Mr. BALLENGER.," Mr. Speaker, last  night, the President stood and spoke.  He spoke well about the problems of  crime and welfare. He .spoke convinc ingly about  the dire  impact of  the  Great Society, about how  the family  unit has broken down over the last 30  years.  He  spoke about values. He  talked  about national security. He copied the  sentiments  of Ronald  Reagan  and  George Bush.  In  fact,  his State  of  the Union  speech, with  the exception of health  care reform, was a broad endorsement  of the Republican agenda. Now is the  time for the President to stand and de liver.  The American people were impressed  with the President's rhetoric. But mere  words do not leave a  lasting  impres sion. Now is the time to stand and de liver.  Deliver us a real welfare reform bill  that will replace  the current corrupt  system of dependency and helplessness.  Deliver us a crime bill that take repeat  offenders off the street for good.  Mr. Speaker, now is the time for the  President to stand and deliver.  TRIBUTE TO THOMAS C. McGRATH  (Mr. HUGHES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1994
19,House,103,-0.153,162,1,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today with great sorrow to pay tribute  to a former Member of the House, and  a personal friend, the Honorable Thom as C. McGrath, who passed away last  week.  Tom McGrath represented New Jer sey's Second Congressional District in  the House  from 1964--U6. Al though he  only served one term, he developed an  outstanding reputation both in Wash ington and back home for hard work,  unquestioned  integrity,  and  a  deep  commitment to public service.  After serving in Congress, Tom went  on to serve as legal counsel for the De partment of Housing and Urban Devel opment, before finally returning back  home to the Jersey shore.  , Tom was a fine lawyer, an outstand ing public  servant, and a wonderful  human being. I am grateful to have the  opportunity  to know Tom McGrath,  and  to follow  in his footsteps  in the  House. My heart goes out to his wife,  Betty and other members of his family  on the loss of this outstanding Amer ican.  PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS DON'T  MATCH WORDS  (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1994
20,House,103,0.6,162,1,Mr. DUNCAN.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  the  President said many good things in his  speech  last night, particularly about  the need to reform our welfare system  and to crack down on violent crime.  The President is very good about giv ing speeches with which almost every one agrees.  The problem is that his actions sel dom ever come close to matching his  words.  For instance, he says he  is against  crime and who isn't, but then he ap points some of the most liberal, soft on-crime judges this country has ever  seen to our Nation's highest courts.  The prime example of this was choos ing a person who was the chief lawyer  for the ACLU for 8 years as his first ap pointment to the Supreme Court.  In addition, the President still clings  to  the out-of-date, discredited belief  that the Federal Government can solve  all our problems.  There is a clear majority today that  knows the Federal Government really  does little more than help those who  work for it.  They know that Government cannot  give us anything without first taking  something from us.  ",1994

24,Senate,103,0.429,201,1,Mr. GREGG.," Madam President,  the  remarks of the President in the State  of the Union address last night were  excellent  remarks  that  summarized  some of the concerns that many of us  had relative  to  the  issues raised last  night by the President. The President,  of course, did make and deliver a well  prepared and excellent State of  the  Union as to style and presentation. He  is a gentleman who has on many occa sions shown us that he has the capacity  to draw forth many ideas and concepts  in addressing the people of this country  through the forum of a joint session of  the Congress.  But I will say this about the Presi dent's speech, because I think it needs  to be said; that is, that. it had with it  a large amount of irony. If you look at  what he is suggesting in a number of  policy areas, for example in the area of  health care, where he has suggested  that we essentially nationalize the sys tem and allow it to be dominated by  the Federal Government; in the area of  education, where his program is one of  calling upon the creation of an outline  of a  standard and curriculum which  would be designed here at the Federal  level  and which will  inevitably  be  forced  upon  local  communities  and  States,  either  through  litigation or  through direct regulatory activity as  part of  the  funding mechanisms and  things like chapter 1; in the area of job  training, where he is suggesting that  we basically have a Federal make-work  job program structured again along the  concepts which were once before seen  in this country, the CETA proposals- all of these ideas which he is putting  on the table and which he has put on  the table last night in the phraseology  which was really superbly framed, real ly,  in substance, are inconsistent and  contradictory to the basic theme of his  speech, which was that we, as a nation,  in order to address core issues which  concern us, such as crime, should take  more  individual  responsibility  and  should have more of an awareness of  the  need of  individuals  to care  for  themselves  and  be  responsible  for  themselves and to be concerned about  this fellow citizens.  in  the  In fact, it is totally ironic that in the  major new initiative that he discussed  last night, which was the welfare re form program, he is suggesting that we  reform a system,  the welfare system,  which has broken down as a result of  the excesses of  the Federal Govern ment in the area of demanding central ized control over a system. He is sug gesting that that system, which is bro ken, should be  fixed by giving more  flexibility to the States and by requir ing more  individual  initiative  in  the  area of the  individuals receiving  the  benefits. But at the same time, he is  suggesting  that reform  for  that sys tem-which  is  so  fundamentally  flawed-he  is  suggesting  taking  the  exact  concepts  which  created  the  flawed system of welfare and applying  them to health care, applying them to  education, and applying  them  to  job  training.  There is clearly an inconsistency and  an irony in that. Thus, as you look at  the phrasing of the speech, it was su perb, and the presentation was superb.  But the substance of the speech is in consistent and contradictory.  It is especially  inconsistent  area of health care.  This is obviously going to be one of  the primary concerns as we  address  this coming legislative session, and we  all know that the health care delivery  system in this country needs some sig nificant improvement.  But what is being proposed by this  administration is not improvement but  it is replacement. It is taking the sys tem which we presently have, and if  you were to compare it, for example, to  an automobile instead of saying, well,  it needs a new engine or needs a new  muffler or needs a  new drive  shaft,  what  they are  saying  is we need a  brand new, entirely different vehicle to  operate.  The vehicle  that  is being proposed  here is a vehicle that is totally domi nated by the Federal Government. The  structure of the proposal brought forth  by  this administration, Mrs. Clinton,  and the President is one which would  essentially lead to a nationalization of  the health care industry.  Why is that? Well, it is very simple.  There are two entities put in place here  which  dominate  up  and  down  the  health care arena, all the activity in  the arena-the National Health Board  and a global pricing mechanism which  the National Health Board has as its  authority  to exercise under  the pro posal which is in the Olin ton plan.  The National Heal th Board will es sentially be a regulatory agency which  will give the States all the flexibility  to do whatever  the National Health  Board decides should be done. And in  giving the States that type of flexibil ity, it will assure the compliance oc curs in the area of the delivery func tion of health care  through a global  pricing mechanism which  is nothing  more than a waterfall of price controls.  It becomes trickle-down heal th care  and, as a very practical matter, will in evitably  lead, as  it has  in countries  like Canada and England, to a signifi cant drop  in quality and  rationing.  That, of course, is what we should not  have happen  in reforming our health  care system.  There are reforms which have been  proposed by a number of Members in  this body, both Republican and Demo cratic Members, which we all agree on  today and which could be passed today  and which fundamentally improve the  health care system and which would  address  the primary concerns which  the President has and I have and which  most Americans have, which  is  that  the people who need health care can  get health care coverage,  that people  are not barred from heal th care as a re sult of a preexisting condition, that the  health care system does not find itself  being charged by insurance companies  which try to keep those people working  in industries which may be less healthy  out of the system or force them to pay  more, that we dropped, have a system  where doctors are practicing defensive  medicine because of fears about mal practice  lawsuits  and we  allow  the  technologies and  the  ideas which are  booming in  the heal th care area and  which are helping people and which are  curing disease  to continue  to expand  and grow through addressing the anti trust laws.  All of those issues have already been  agreed to by a majority of both Houses  of  the Congress and could be passed  today and would  fundamentally  im prove the health care system. But this  administration, rather than seeking to  take that sort of approach, has decided  no, we are not going to do that; instead  we are going to nationalize the system  and create everyone as a dependent of  a small board here in Washington.  Is that transferring to the individual  responsibility?  Is  that  responding  to  the heal th care crisis the way that he  has proposed that we  respond  to  the  health care crisis? No, it is just the op posite. The same can be said for edu cation.  The education proposal of  this ad ministration called Goal 2000, which  has a very nice, innocuous name, is es sentially a proposal which says we, the  Federal Government, know better how  to manage education  than you,  the  local communities, know how to man age education, than you,  the parents,  know how to manage education. We are  going to design a national curriculum  for you now. It is voluntary. Of course,  it is voluntary. But just in case you de cide you do not want it, we are going to  structure it in a way where one of our  local community groups or your State  groups or maybe your national group  can come in and sue you and make you  force you to comply with it.  Alternatively, if that does not work,  we may make more Federal funds de",1994
25,Senate,103,-0.328,227,1,Mr. DODD.," Madam President, in my  closing minutes, I want to make one  comment in response to some of the ar guments that have been made by those  who oppose  this measure. There have  been questions raised about  the par ticular operation of  this Court-the  crimes it would cover,  the manner in  which judges would be chosen, the pro tections  available  for  the  accused.  Quite  frankly, Mr.  President,  these  questions put the cart before the horse.  They are legitimate questions, but that  is not the issue before us.  I remind my colleagues that we are  not voting on a resolution of ratifica tion, nor are we being asked to endorse  any one proposal over another. Those  questions will not be with us for sev eral years, perhaps more. All we are  being asked to do today is to lend our  support  to  the basic proposition, af firmed at Nuremberg half a  century  ago, that when people commit crimes  against  the  international order,  they  should expect to be brought to justice.  Surely we  can muster  the  courage,  after all we have learned, to stand up  for that basic principle.  I will not  repeat  the arguments  I  have made  in  support of  the  Inter national Criminal Court or attempt to  summarize them here. But I do want to  emphasize one very important point.  Our moment in history is before us.  With the end of the cold war we have  been given a gift that previous genera tions could only have dreamed of:  the  opportunity  to  leave  our  indelible  mark on the future  itself. But as we  take stock of this moment and all that  it entails, I hope we will not forget a  certain lesson from the past.  In his closing statement before  the  Nuremberg Tribunal,  Justice Robert  Jackson of the U.S. prosecution sum marized  the  long  list of crimes  the  Nazis had been accused of, and the evi dence against them. He then turned his  attention  to  the  responsibility  that  rested upon the judges on the tribunal.  Their decision, he said, was not simply  a judgment on the guilt or innocence of  the particular individuals involved. In  truth, he said, it was a judgment on the  Holocaust itself.  Justice Jackson's statement reminds  us why it is that we must bring inter national criminals before  the bar of  justice, if not  to undo  the wrong, at  least to restore our confidence in what  is decent and what is just. He closed  his argument with these words:  It is against this background that these de fendants now ask this tribunal to say that  they are not guilty of planning, executing, or  ",1994

27,Senate,103,0.361,240,1,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1994
28,Senate,103,-0.314,240,1,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  the lan guage  in section 170A of the Foreign  Relations Authorization Act now be fore the Senate expresses the sense of  Congress that the United States should  encourage  the  establishment  of  an  international criminal court within the  United Nations system.  I support the  proposal by my friend from Connecti cut, because I share his belief that the  establishment of a mechanism for the  enforcement of the international rule  of  law would be  a  positive develop ment. But let us be clear about what  this resolution does not do. It does not  put the Congress on record in favor of  any particular proposal. It says only  that the Congress encourages the proc ess to move forward.  A question has arisen as to whether  the Judiciary Committee should review  this resolution. The establishment of  an international criminal court would  obviously have profound  implications  were  the United States  to  join  it.  I  agree,  therefore,  that  the  Judiciary  Committee has an interest in this sub ject-and will continue to closely mon itor developments in the International  Law Commission and  the United Na tions. But formal Judiciary Committee  review of  this  resolution  is, at  this  time, not necessary.  There have been many proposals put  forth  by  various  organizations  and  members of the academic community,  but there is as yet no final draft of a  statute for an international criminal  court. Should this matter come before  the Senate in the form of a treaty or in  any other form binding upon the Unit ed States,  the Senate can be assured  that I would insist that the Judiciary  Cammi ttee undertake a  thorough re view at that time.  VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1254  ",1994
29,Senate,103,0.631,240,1,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I move to  reconsider the vote.  ",1994
30,Senate,103,0.084,266,1,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, first, I  want to say obviously this is an issue  that stirs deep emotions, and I can un derstand  fully  the viewpoints of  the  major proponents of  this  legislation,  the Senator from New Hampshire and  the Senator from Massachusetts and  the Senator from Arizona.  Next, I would like to say that I think  it is important to know who the spon sors are of this amendment. I do not  think there are two more distinguished  veterans of the Vietnam war than the  two  Senators,  Senator KERRY  from  Massachusetts  and  Senator McCAIN  from Arizona. We  are  familiar with  their records. Not that what they say  should be  the total gospel but, none theless, the fact is that those two Sen ators-one a prisoner of war for a good  number of years over there, the other  with a very distinguished war record in  the Navy  in Vietnam-are  the  key  sponsors of this resolution.  It seems to me the key question we  are facing up to tonight is how do we  get more information, the best possible  information, on  those missing  in ac tion, the MIA's. It seems to me that is  the central question to the debate that  we are engaged  in.  I would  like  to  make several points, if I might.  First, I do not think we can discount  the fact that nearly every codel, con gressional delegation, Representatives  and Senators, that have visited Viet nam, I know of none that have come  back saying other than the fact that  they believe  the Vietnamese are co operating fully. If there are others, if  there are some delegations that have  come back with a contrary view, I do  not know who they are. Nor, Mr. Presi dent, do I  think we can set aside the  judgment of those distinguished offi cers,  some  retired, who  have  spent  months and years on this problem and  have come to the conclusion that the  Vietnamese are cooperating fully.  General Needham's name has been  mentioned several times, and Admiral  Larson  and General Vessey.  I,  like  many of the Senators, have not been to  Vietnam recently. So who do we de pend upon? We depend upon those who  have been  there and  those who have  spent a lot of time on this. This is not  just  some  flash  visit  by. General  Vessey: Go in, get the rapid tour, leave  after 2 days, and  that is it. General  Vessey has been there I do not know  how many times.  I must say,  I have been  impressed  with the number of visits that Senator  KERRY has made and,  indeed, Senator  SMITH  likewise. During  the summer time when  the rest of us are off on  some vacation, when you turn on the  television,  there  is  Senator KERRY  making his sixth or seventh trip-I be lieve is it eight trips-eight trips Sen ator KERRY has made. So this is a deep  passion of his to do everything he can  to find what has happened to the MIA's  there. This is very influential on the  rest of us. So we have respect for their  judgment, and their judgment has been  the time has come now to lift the trade  embargo against Vietnam.  The second point I  think is a very  important one. Do we not wish to re ward in some small way  the Govern ment of Vietnam that has been cooper ative? We have said to them: If you co operate, meet  these conditions,  then  we will lift the trade embargo.  They have done that. So what do we  say? ""No, no,  there is another hurdle  out there for you?"" Or do we say, ""yes,  we respect what you have done and we  will lift that trade embargo."" But the  next point, it seems to me, is very im portant. It has been made, but I would  like to stress it again. Lifting the trade  embargo is not a total lift of all the re strictions against Vietnam. We still do  not  diplomatically  recognize  that  country. Vietnam is extremely anxious  to  achieve  diplomatic  recognition.  That is something different from lift ing the trade embargo.  The  lifting of  the  trade  embargo  means we will trade with Vietnam, but  it does not mean we will have full dip lomatic relations. That is another re ward, if you would, that we can grant  to  the Vietnamese  later  if they are  even more forthcoming than has been  stated to date by those who have been  involved much deeper  in  this  than  I  have.  Fourth, will this amendment dimin ish the chances for more information  on the MIA's? Not in my judgment, for  two reasons. First, it seems to me by  rewarding in this modest way,  lifting  of the trade embargo, we are encourag ing even greater cooperation. There are  those who are in the Vietnamese Gov ernment who just find it too much ef fort, too lazy to do it or do not want to  cooperate.  There  is  a  bureaucratic  struggle,  I am sure, within Vietnam:  Yes, do something and cooperate fur ther with those Americans. You could  get something out of it. And there are  those undoubtedly within the Vietnam ese Government who are saying do not  do anything more; they will not reward  you in any fashion anyway.  So we are saying to those who are for  the fullest cooperation, this is what we  will give you. We will give you this lift ing of the  trade embargo and maybe  later  restoration of diplomatic  rela tions. That is the first point.  But  the  second point-and I  know  Senator SMITH is entirely sincere in ev erything he says, but he just brushed  aside this fact-is that more informa tion will be found in that country when  there  are more Americans  around  there. I strongly believe that. I think  the best way to get more information  about MIA's in Vietnam  is  to have  Americans across the countryside, even  if it is trying  to sell pumps in some  small village. All  the Americans that  will come  there for further trade are  not going  to be off shore drilling oil  wells. They are going to be trying to  sell automobiles. They are going to be  trying to sell tractors. They are going  to be trying to sell backhoes. They are  going to be trying to sell telecommuni cations equipment.  In my  judgment,  the best way to get more information  is  to  have  these Americans  spread  across the country.  Now,  fifth, Mr.  President,  regret tably, there cannot ever be a  full ac counting of every MIA. Just think of  it. From World War II, there are still  78,000 Americans who are missing.  I  would just like to give a tiny illustra tion,  if I might, of an  incident  that  struck home with me.  When World War II came, I left col lege along with another college class mate. We were acquaintances. We were  not close  friends. We both went into  the Marine Corps  together-not  to gether, but we both went into the Ma rine Corps. We both joined the First  Marine Division, both landed in Gua dalcanal on August 7, 1942. He, Russ  Whittlesey, was killed in September of  1942 on Guadalcanal. Because of  the  fluid situation, his body was found and  was buried very quickly because of the  situation that then existed.  Three months  later we  conquered  Guadalcanal. We had driven away or  killed all the Japanese that were there.  We had control of the island. Our lines  and  the place where Russ Whittlesey  was buried were fairly well known-not  exactly; we did not find his body, not  that I was personally searching for it,  but the graves registration unit of our  division was. So he was carried as miss ing. They knew he had been killed, but  they never found his body.  In  1989,  47  years  after  Russ  Whittlesey was killed, a  farmer was  plowing and struck and found his re mains.  Now,  the point  I  am making, Mr.  President, sad though it is, we will not  find the remains of every single Amer ican soldier who is missing in action in  Vietnam. Regrettably, that is true.  Now,  the sixth point. What do we  gain in the United States from the lift ing of this  trade embargo? It in my  judgment improves our opportunity to  learn more about the MIA's that are  there. That, of course, is the essential  point of the discussion we are having  this evening. Senator SMITH'S creden tials as being probusiness he set forth.  But it seems to me that it is important  to remember that this is a tremendous  market that exists. We will not lose  ",1994
31,Senate,103,0.623,279,1,Mr. SMITH.," Thank you, Mr. Presi dent.  On December 10, President Clinton  stated in a  letter to me  that ""I am  deeply  committed  to  resolving  the  cases of all personnel missing since the  Vietnam war. For this reason, I have  made achieving the fullest possible ac counting for our POW/MIA's the test of  our relationship with Vietnam. Like  you, I seek an honorable resolution to  this issue. I will not accept mere activ ity by Vietnam on POW/MIA issues as  progress."" Again,  the President could  not make it more clear, and I commend  him for it. The test of whether or not  we move  forward with Vietnam de pends on real and complete answers on  the POW/MIA issue-not on how many  crash site excavators Vietnam allows  into their country and not on whether  it would be profitable  for American  businesses to go to drill for oil.  On November 19, while at the APEC  summit, the President stated that he,  ""could see Vietnam more  integrated  into the region's economic and politi cal life after providing the fullest pos sible accounting of  those Americans  who  did  not  return  from  the war  there.""  So can I. So can I, Mr. President.  On July 16, White House Deputy Na tional Security Advisor Samuel Berger  stated,  ""The  President  understands  that while the processes underway in  Vietnam on the POW/MIA issue are im portant-and I  remind my colleagues  not to be confused by the word process  as some people in this body like to use  it  to measure  POW/MIA  progress,  which is a little disingenuous:  The litmus tests here are concrete results  and solid answers * * * the President has  specifically rejected suggestions that he lift  the trade embargo, partially or fully, even  though  that position disadvantages Amer ican business. This is not a commercial or  diplomatic  issue for  the President; it is a  moral one.  . . Vietnamese efforts  to date,  while welcome, are not sufficient to warrant  changes  in our  trade embargo or  further  steps  in U.S.-Vietnam relations. That is a  very powerful and appropriate statement""This is not a commercial or diplo matic issue for the President-it is a  moral one."" And it is. Ask those fami lies. Ask those veterans groups. It is a  moral  issue and we do not have  the  right to make that moral decision.  On July 2, the White House stated:  Our policy toward Vietnam must be driven  not by commercial interests but by the over riding purpose of achieving further progress  toward the fullest possible accounting of our  POW/MIAs ... Progress to date is simply not  sufficient to warrant any change in our trade  embargo or any further steps toward normal ization.  And  last April, at a White House  news conference,  the President stated  that he was:  Much more heavily influenced by the fami lies of the people whose  lives were lost or  whose lives remain in question than by the  commercial interests and  the other things  which seem so compelling in this moment. I  am just very interested by how the families  feel.  Finally, just days after his election,  then President-elect Clinton stated the  following at a Veterans Day ceremony  in Little Rock:  As  I have pledged  throughout my cam paign, I will do my very best to make sure  we have a final resolution of the POW/MIA  issue ... I have sent a clear message that  there will be no normalization of relations  with any nation that is at all suspected of  withholding any information. We must have  as full an accounting as is humanly possible.  That  is  the President. That  is  the  policy. That is what this President be lieves and we ought to support it.  Now, Mr. President,  I know during  the break, a few of my colleagues went  to Vietnam, as part of CODELS  that  were  traveling  in Asia. And while  there, you received the standard brief ings and you caught a glimpse of the  process  underway  by which we  are  slowly obtaining relevant information  that could lead  to an accounting for  some U.S. personnel, although we are  mostly talking, in terms of the ongoing  crash site excavations, about people we  know died during the war, and indeed  they were  listed as killed  in action/  body not recovered. I am sure the Sen ators who went to Vietnam were also  allowed to view another expensive side show in which United States investiga tors are stationed at Vietnam's central  museums--!  have  been  there  four  times--where they are given  informa tion to review bit by bit, only a small  percentage of which actually pertains  to active POW/MIA cases. Most of it re fers to people who already came home  or are dead.  But, I would hope my colleagues who  went to Vietnam would be able to sepa rate in their minds, terms like ""proc ess"" from ""accounting,"" and ""fate de termined"" from ""tangible results,"" and  ""cooperation""  from  ""fully  forthcom ing.'' And I hope they would not forget  that more than 80 percent of the miss ing cases from Laos, where there has  been extremely limited results, actu ally  involve  areas  that were  under  North Vietnamese control during  the  war. And while we are slowly getting  records, after years of requesting them,  it is a  slow process, and probably a  painful, difficult, or embarrassing one  for the Vietnamese.  Nonetheless,  the Vietnamese should  know that this is a process that they  must go  through for relations to im prove with  the United States. And I  take  strong exception  to  those who  would hold up every document as it is  now slowly turned over by Vietnam, 20  years later, and say, ""look, here is the  proof-Vietnamese  officials  are  now  fully cooperating and  they have now  told us everything  they know about  our POW's and MIA's."" I  recall one  Senator a  few months  ago  actually  praised Vietnam for turning over a bag  of letters addressed to missing service men from their families during the war  which were never delivered  to  these  guys sitting in their cells. Never even  delivered. And they turned them over.  That is progress? Vietnam gave  these  letters back  to  the United States in  September and  issued a press release  saying ""New MIA Documents Found.""  Are you telling me they did not know  where  those  letters were? Give me a  break. And then a Senator back here  ",1994
32,,103,-0.383,331,1,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sa lute a distinguished young man  from Rhode  Island who has attained  the  rank of Eagle  Scout  in  the Boy Scouts of America. He  is  Todd S. Muffoletto of Troop 18 in Frenchtown,  RI, and he is honored this week for his note worthy achievement.  Not every young American who  joins  the  Boy Scouts earns the prestigious Eagle Scout  Award.  In  fact only 2.5 percent of all Boy  Scouts do. To earn  the award, a Boy Scout  must fulfill requirements in the areas of leader ship, service, and outdoor skills. He must earn  21 merit badges,  11  of which are  required  from areas such as citizenship in the commu nity, citizenship in the Nation, citizenship in the  world, safety, environmental science, and first  aid.  As he progresses  through  the Boy Scout  ranks, a Scout must demonstrate participation  in  increasingly  more  responsible  service  projects. He must also demonstrate leadership  positions in his patrol and/or troop. This young  man has distinguished himself in accordance  with these criteria.  For his Eagle Scout project, Todd helped to  clean up area parks in East Greenwich by re moving debris and painting recreational equip ment with paint donated by the  local depart ment of recreation.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in saluting Eagle Scout Todd S.  Muffoletto. In turn, we must duly recognize the  Boy Scouts of America  for establishing  the  Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous criteria  its aspirants must meet. This program has  through its 80 years honed and enhanced the  leadership skills and commitment  to public  service of many outstanding Americans,  two  dozen of whom now serve in the House.  It  is my  sincere  belief  that  Todd  S.  Muffoletto will continue his public service, and  in so doing will further distinguish himself and  consequently  better  his  community.  I  join  friends, colleagues, and family who this week  salute him.  HON. DAVID E. BONIOR  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 26, 1994  ",1994
33,,103,-0.547,331,1,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay tribute to a longtime friend, Peggy John son, director of government services  for  the  Clinton River Watershed Council. Peggy has  held many important positions within the envi ronmental community, however, she has never  been one to hide behind a desk. I fondly recall  canvassing the Clinton River with Peggy, knee  deep in mud, as we organized the fight to pre vent the paving of the river. With Peg's leader ship we won that battle. On Thursday evening,  January 27, Peggy will be honored at a recep tion held in her honor at Oakland University in  Rochester, Ml.  Taking an active role in our community is a  responsibility we all share, but few fulfill. The  Clinton River Watershed and  the State of  Michigan have a great friend  in Peggy John son. She has been in the forefront of land and  water management issues for over 20 years.  Peggy is responsible for much of the Clinton  River's recent improvement in water quality. In  addition to her work with the Clinton River Wa tershed Council, Peggy has worked with  the  Southeast Michigan Council of Governments,  the Michigan  Department  of Natural  Re sources and numerous organizations to further  the goal of responsible land and water use.  To honor Peggy for her leadership and con tributions, the Peggy B. Johnson Fund for the  Clinton River has been established. A sub stantial portion of every  ticket sold  for  this  event will be placed in the new fund to create  a lasting commitment to promote the protec tion and wise use of the Clinton River Water shed.  I am pleased to pay tribute to Peggy John son. I ask that my colleagues join me in rec ognizing her many years of hard work and  dedication.  TRIBUTE TO BRIAN P. DERHAM  HON.

34,Senate,103,-0.352,370,1,Mr. KERRY.," President Carter points  out that the work of NED and its affili ates, promoting education and transi tion  to  free markets, has been  ex tremely cost effective. And the money  spent  in  promoting  democracy  is  money saved in responding to civil con flicts.  Vaclav Havel said:  The National Democratic  Institute has  been one of the first supporting actors in the  democratic revolution in our country.  Benazir Bhutto says:  It is vital to the U.S. and the future of de mocracy for the work of NDI to proceed.  Sali Berisha, President of Albania,  said:  The elimination of NED will be a blow to  the emergence of democracy in many areas  of the globe.  You have columnists such as George  Will and A.M. Rosenthal agreeing, and  David Broder, all backers of NED, who  point out that the cold war might be  over, but we need NED to continue.  And  there are Yelena Bonner and  Andrei Sakharov. The closing of  the  endowment would pose a danger, or its  limitation.  Fong Lizzie,  cist, who said:  a Chinese astrophysi The movements of many countries, includ ing China, are directly encouraged by NED's  efforts.  Mr. President, this is not the time to  cut NED. It is the time to add to NED.  It is the time to allow the President of  the United States to carry out the de mocratization effort that we spend bil lions of dollars to support through the  defense budget of this country.  I strongly urge my colleagues to lis ten  to  the words of  the people who  themselves  are  struggling. Dr.  Sein  Win,  the Prime Minister of  the Na tional Coalition Government of  the  Union of Burma wrote recently that:  NED support has enabled the democratic  forces of Burma to achieve much progress  and success.  I cannot think of a greater testimony  than the people who put their lives at  risk in an effort to get democracy, who  ask us to keep alive this effort.  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to  the Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCAIN.

So  I am  not going to go over all of those. I con",1994
35,Senate,103,-0.374,383,1,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I rise to  discuss the amendment. First, I wish to  commend the chairman of the commit tee for the work done on this amend ment  and  know  that  the  language  being proposed represents a significant  revision and improvement from earlier  drafts.  It would be  ironic if the Treaty on  Open Skies were to cloud our citizens'  rights to freedom of information. We  must approach statutory exemptions  to  the Freedom of  Information Act  with great care. Given that the act has  a series of exceptions that balance the  public's right to free and open access to  Government  information with  such  competing concerns as national secu rity and  foreign policy,  it should be  rare that Congress is asked to create a  statutory exemption from the act.  The Freedom of Information Act has  become and essential  tool  in our de mocracy for the public to obtain infor mation about what their Government  is doing. Through direct access and  media access, the Freedom of Inf orma tion Act provides a check on how the  Government operates. Through proper  implementation of  the act we make  openness the rule and Government se crecy the exception.  I see that the language proposed in  the amendment exempts data collected  by sensors during observation flights  from FOIA disclosure for a period of 5  years. I would have preferred that the  shoe be on the other foot. Our general  presumption of availability of informa tion should govern in the absence of a  specific determination that disclosure  of certain information would be harm ful to our national security interests or  the  legitimate  interests of a  foreign  government.  It is in this manner that we have tra ditionally structured statutory exemp tions  to  the Freedom of Information  Act. Thus, it is only after rulemaking  and with periodic reports to Congress  that Government information on con trol, accounting and security measures  for  the physical protection of special  nuclear material, source materials and  byproduct materials is excluded from  FOIA disclosure.  I ask for the chairman's understand ing of the standard that is to be applied  by  the  Secretaries  of Defense  and  State. Subsection (a)(2) of the amend ment  requires  a  determination  that  data with respect to the United States  be  restricted  only  if  its  disclosure  ""could be reasonably expected to cause  substantial harm."" Is it the chairman's  understanding  that  the  standard  is  akin to that for classification of infor mation as ""secret""?  As for data with respect to a foreign  country,  the exemption applies if the  country has not disclosed the data to  the public. The amendment allows for  the foreign country, acting through the  open skies consultative commission or  diplomatic channels  to authorize  the  United States to disclose  the data to  citizens of the United States.  I intend no harm to the integrity of  the treaty, but ask whether the basic  purposes of the treaty are not served  by  the presumption of openness with  exceptional  treatment being reserved  to data from other countries on  the  same basis as that from this country;  namely, some identifiable national se curity interest.  I suggest that our treaty negotiators  are well-advised to explain the benefits  of openness on this and future treaty  subjects  to  their  counterparts  from  other countries. Certainly there can be  exceptions, but experience has taught  us that such exceptions to the rule of  openness should be narrowly created  and specifically applied.  I ask my colleagues to join with me  to urge the Department of State to use  its good offices and those of the open  skies consultative commission to urge  foreign  signatories of  the  treaty  to  enjoy the benefits of maximum disclo sure and the rule of openness.  Indeed, by title IV of this bill we are  establishing a Commission on Protect ing  and Reducing Government  Sec retary for the express purpose of reduc ing  the volume of classified informa tion.  I recognize that overflight data can  contain sensitive security information.  Such  data, when  otherwise  secret,  should not become available to hostile  forces  through participation  in Open  Skies. The need for legitimate excep tion for such  information is not  the  issue.  We should encourage signatories  to  Open Skies by protecting participants.  We should not and need not do so by  doing damage to our domestic law or  disserving our democratic interests in  expanding  information and participa tion of the citizenry in our public pol icy. I do not wish to see the language  or processes of this amendment become  a precedent.  ",1994

37,Senate,103,-0.145,409,1,Mr. NUNN.," Madam President, I am  delighted  that  this  amendment has  been worked out.  I congratulate  the  Senator from Kentucky and  the Sen ator  from Washington,  the Senator  from Michigan, the Senator from North  Carolina, and others, who worked on  this amendment.  This is an enormously important sub ject. I think all of us share the excite ment  of  the  free markets  and  the  emerging democracies that are now be ginning to take shape in Eastern Eu rope and Central Europe. I think we all  realize  that  there  could be another  threat  to  those  countries down  the  road. I think we all were sobered by the  recent Russian election and some of  the very extreme statements that were  made by  the so-called Liberal Demo cratic Party and Mr. Zhirinovsky.  I also believe, however, the Partner ship  for  Peace  approach  that was  adopted at  the NATO  summit  con ference was  the  right  approach.  needs some beef; it needs some definite  criteria; it needs some resources. But I  think it gives time to answer some cru cial questions. The countries involved,  including Czechoslovakia, Poland, and  Hungary, have to answer some crucial  questions and we have to answer some.  The committee responsible  for pro viding resources in a declining budget  period will be asking some real tough  questions like who is going to provide  the  forward deployment of  forces  if  It  those  forward deployments  are nec essary? Are we extending the nuclear  umbrella? If so, what are  the condi tions of that extension? We have a lot  of questions that need to be asked and  a  lot  of preparation.  I  think  this  amendment  reflects  the  appropriate  approach. So I  intend to vote for the  amendment.  ",1994
38,Senate,103,-0.205,409,1,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Madam President,  I rise to support the amendment and  thank my colleagues who have put it  together. I think it gives the Senate an  opportunity at this uncertain moment  in Eastern and Central European his tory  to make a  statement, which  is  that we understand that in  the post cold war world we have some central  tenets and principles for foreign policy.  One  is to try to sustain the newly  democratic and largest nation of Rus sia, but there are other goals that we  have,  too. Those  include keeping  the  faith,  the  trust with  the  people  of  Central Europe, of the Baltic nations,  of Ukraine to whom we appealed over  the years as captive nations to rise up  and assert  their  freedom. Now  they  have done  it. It would be a  terrible  dereliction of our responsibility and a  breach of our basic principles  to be come so centered in our concern about  a stable Russia that our response is to  be timid in our dealings with other al lies and friends in Europe.  Madam President, the recent politi cal turmoil in Russia has shown us how  unstable that country is and raises the  concern that Russia may become, once  again, expansionist in its foreign pol icy-perhaps toward the Ukraine, per haps toward the Bal tic nations. In that  event, or with that possibility in mind,  it is even more important that we not  remain silent about our willingness to  embrace, through NATO, those nations  that follow the principles of democracy  and respect the territorial integrity of  others in the region.  Finally, there are those who say ex tending membership to the nations of  Central Europe, particularly Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slo vakia, draws a  line in Europe. It does  not.  NATO has always been a defensive al liance-never  threatened  its  neigh bors-and it never will. It is there to  protect those who  live by and follow  the principles of democracy to which  we, as a Nation, are committed.  This amendment makes that inclina tion of our foreign policy clear. I con gratulate my colleagues for  introduc ing it, and I am proud to support it.  I thank the Chair.  ",1994
39,Senate,103,0.272,409,1,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President,  I would  like to congratulate the Senator from  Kentucky for  introducing his amend ment. I have long supported the notion  of offering NATO membership to those  newly democratized nations of Central  Europe which are seeking it so avidly.  Our failure to respond to the Czech  Republic's, Hungary's and Poland's de sire for membership, unless rectified,  could provide ominous for the future of  this vital region of the world. Twice  this century  this  region has proved  turned into an East-West battlefield. If  this situation is not to recur, we would  be well-advised to cement the new de mocracies of the region into a broad  stable security framework which can  guarantee their security. NATO alone  can fulfil this role.  I have heard some of my colleagues  assert, quite rightly, that Russia has  no right to exercise a veto over Czech,  Hungarian, or Polish membership of  NA TO. By shrinking from addressing  this vital question, the Clinton admin istration may have played  into  the  hands of Moscow's new hard liners--we  have demonstrated that, indeed,  they  can aspire to have a veto over the for eign and security policies of the sov ereign nations of Central Europe.  I  should also point out to my colleagues,  in passing that the C.S.C.E. Treaty, to  which Russia  is a  signatory, specifi cally reserves to all of its members the  right  to  join any alliance  they wish  free from external interference.  I would wish that the President, dur ing his recent summit in Europe, had  addressed  this question squarely.  In stead he chose to offer a rather vague,  inclusive, partnership for peace to all  members of the former Warsaw Pact  and Soviet Union. I fail to see how Pol ish, Czech, and Hungarian security con cerns can be allayed by placing them in  a partnership alongside  the very na tions whom they most fear. And recent  events in Moscow, specifically the elec toral success of Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  demonstrate that those fears are well  founded.  Now,  the task before us is to make  the best  that we can out of the so called partnership for peace. Let us use  it to establish a series of guideposts for  those nations who wish to join NATO.  Let us, as the Senator from Kentucky  has urged,  lay down a set of criteria  which they must meet and, when they  have met those criteria, let us welcome  into our alliance in a spirit of inclusion  and in  the fervent hope  that Central  Europe can escape its tragic history as  the scene of East-West conflict.

40,Senate,103,0.262,435,1,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I would  like to bring to my colleagues' atten tion the founding of the Virginia Child  Advocacy Group  in Richmond, VA.  This statewide,  independent organiza tion was recently established through a  partnership between the Federal Home  Loan Mortgage Corporation  [Freddie  Mac], and the National Association of  Child Advocates [NACAJ.  This organization was set up to serve  as a voice  for  the needs of children  throughout the Commonwealth of Vir ginia. Although many  organizations  devoted to private, not-for-profit child  advocacy  exist  in Virginia,  limited  State budgets restrict the flow of funds  necessary  for  these organizations  to  exist. Because of this lack of revenue,  the Commonwealth  has,  until  now,  lacked  a  strong,  independent  group  with a comprehensive strategy to ad dress the needs of Virginia's children.  The Virginia Child Advocacy Group  is intended to serve as a self-sustaining  organization, which will mobilize pri vate  resources  within  the  State.  Through an innovative effort  to pair  private industry with not-for-profit re sources  and  expertise, Virginia will  have  the benefit of well-coordinated  programs focused on the well-being of  our young people.  Once again, I would like to commend  the efforts of NACA. who provided the  organizational development necessary  to set up the Virginia Child Advocacy  Group,  and  Freddie  Mac,  which,  through the Freddie Mac Foundation,  made  the  generous  contribution  to  fund the organization's first year of op eration. Freddie Mac has long been an  advocate of children and families, and  supports policies and programs which  devote  attention  to  their  needs.  Through the combined efforts of these  two fine organizations, Virginia is the  beneficiary of a group devoted to the  young people of the Commonwealth.   HONORING GENE KELLY  ",1994
41,Senate,103,0.115,435,1,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. President,  most Americans consider  themselves  very fortunate when they are able to  spend their lives doing what they enjoy  the most. Today in Bloomington, MN.  Gene Kelly will be retiring from  just  such a career-over 32 years as man ager of  the Bloomington Parks and  Recreation Division. The  citizens of  Bloomington are  indebted to him for  making their suburban homes  into a  real community.  Playing in the city parks of East St.  Paul, Gene early developed his love for  parks, sports and people. At Harding  High School, he  lettered  in football,  basketball,  and  baseball,  and was  named an All-City Base ball and Bas ketball player. In 1938, he pitched his  way to the American Legion Minnesota  State Championship. He was a star at  the University of Minnesota, where he  lettered in basketball and baseball. As  a pitcher, he only lost 3 games over the  course of 3 years, and in basketball his  proudest moment was when he made  the winning free throw with 8 seconds  to go to beat Indiana 48--47 in 1944.  Following graduation with a major in  education and a minor in public health,  Gene  realized  a  lifelong dream and  signed a professional baseball contract  with the St. Paul Saints of the Amer ican Association; subsequently playing  with Raleigh in the Carolina League,  Evansville in the 3-I League, Seattle in  the Pacific Coast League, and Syracuse  in the International League. In retire ment, Gene continued to keep his base ball enthusiasm alive by leading many  community amateur  teams  to  state  and national championships.  In 1947, Gene left professional base ball and worked in the communities of  Corydon,  KY;  Wake  Forest,  NC;  Willmar, MN, where he held his first  Parks  and Recreation Directorship;  and on to Elgin, IL, for another Parks  and Recreation position. In 1961, Gene  became Parks and Recreation Director  in his beloved Bloomington.  He also became involved as an offi cial in high school and college baseball,  basketball, and football. For 37 years,  he  traveled to many Minnesota com munities officiating  for high  school  games and officiating college games in  Minnesota, North Dakota, South Da kota, Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. In  fact, he also umpired with  the ""Big  Leagues""  in  1979  for  the American  League during the umpire strike.  It was during his officiating years  that I had my first run-in with Gene,  and he will never let me forget. It just  so happens that Gene officiated a bas ketball game when  I played  for St.  John's Academy. Under his scrutiny, I  was fouled out before  the end of the  game. Afterwards, my father, who was  athletic director at St.  John's, met  Gene and remarked, ""You were pretty  rough on my son out there."" To which  Gene replied, ""Well, your son was pret ty rough on the opponents.""  Little did we  know  then  that we  would have an opportunity for many  more meetings. When I started raising  my family  in Minneapolis,  I was  in volved as a member and chair of the  Hennepin Open Space and Parks Com mission and  the Metropolitan Parks  and Open Space Commission. Gene was  a prominent local official, involved in  the Hennepin Parks Commission  as  well as  the Metropolitan Parks and  Open Space Commission.  Gene has dedicated his career to the  acquisition, planning, growth, develop ment and preservation of Blooming ton's extensive park system, which has  grown from several hundred acres  to  8,000 and 110 park areas during his ten ure  in Bloomington. As  a  result of  Gene's  leadership,  voters  have  ap proved  bond  programs  totaling  $12,640,000 for park land acquisition and  site improvement which has resulted in  a  system of playfields, playgrounds,  playlots,  urban  community  and  re gional parks, and thousands of acres of  conservation and open space areas.

44,Senate,103,0.375,474,1,Mr. COATS.," Madam President, I rise  to support  the Helms amendment on  Chinese refugees. I commend Senator  HELMS for taking action to correct this  flaw in U.S. policy.  We  cannot  ignore  this  particular  abuse of  its citizens by  the Chinese  Government when we have the power  to help. As we have seen, the Chinese  Government has stepped up its repres sion of  their people  through policies  which force families to limit their chil dren  to one. They do  this by forcing  women to undergo abortions, and both  men and women to be sterilized. Many  women are even cruelly forced to have  abortions often late in term in order to  prosecute this one-child policy.  Earlier this year we heard reports of  another new horror  taking place  in  China. In order to ensure the births of  only perfect babies, a new Chinese law  would require mothers to undergo ge netic testing of their fetuses. This is a  requirement, not a voluntary personal  choice as in the United States. Even  more horrible is the fact that, should  the results of these test reveal that the  child might be born with a disability,  the mother is forced to terminate the  pregnancy.  I don't think anyone will disagree  that  these measures are abominable.  While we may have no power to dictate  Chinese policy, we  can acknowledge  the fear which moves them to escape  such  oppressive  policies  by  helping  them enter the United States.  This amendment would grant asylum  to  those Chinese who  come  to  the  United States because they fear perse cution by China for refusing to abort a  pregnancy or undergo sterilization. It  gives this group of refugees equivalent  status as those fleeing for political dis sent.  Madam President,  in 1989, Members  may recall an amendment dealing with  this same subject we voted on in this  body which passed 95  to 0. The  lan guage of the Helms amendment is iden tical  to  that language. Although  the  1989 vote followed closely after the Chi nese  massacre  of  students  at  Tiananmen Square, we  should be no  less willing today to take action to as sist people on whom an enormous in justice is being perpetrated.  Until a year ago it was a matter of  Justice Department Policy to grant fa vorable immigration status to Chinese  coming  to  the United States under  these circumstances. However, Presi dent Clinton chose to reverse this deci sion, and rescinded a directive  issued  by Attorney General William Barr  shortly before he left office which laid  out the implementing regulations.  For a year now it has been United  States policy  to deport Chinese who  fled China's coercive one-child per fam ily policy.  I  frankly couldn't under stand why President Clinton made such  a decision. Although a recent case in",1994
45,Senate,103,-0.397,487,1,Mr. SIMON.," Madam President, we  have the world's only Foreign Service  with no language entry requirement, so  it is particularly important that we en courage  proficiency  in  languages  among Foreign Service officers.  I've  put forward several measures in the au thorization bill,  and others  in past  years, with the object of raising lan guage proficiency in the Foreign Serv ice.  I now offer another amendment, mod estly designed to stimulate the assign ment to our overseas posts of Foreign  Service officers who speak and read the  local language well.  S4/R4--speaking:four/reading:four-is  the score given to Foreign Service offi cers with  so-called  full  professional  proficiency in a  language. This means  real fluency, the ability to appear at a  public meeting or be  interviewed on  television. Getting and keeping an S4/  R4 takes hard work and talent. In com parison, S5/R5 is the score for an edu cated native-language speaker.  Last year I consulted with numerous  ambassadorial nominees, Foreign Serv ice officers, who stressed  the  impor tance of having at least some staffers  in  their Embassies with  full  profes sional proficiency.  But we have never, so far, accepted  full professional proficiency as a  re quirement for any  job  in any of our  Embassies overseas. The highest cur rent requirement for any job is mini mum professional proficiency, which is  defined as able to speak the language  with sufficient structural accuracy and  vocabulary to participate effectively in  most  formal  and  informal  conversa tions on practical, social, and profes sional  topics. In other words, able  to  make  yourself  understood,  sort  of,  most of the time.  This isn't good enough. My amend ment mandates the State Department  to assign Foreign Service officers with  full professional proficiency  to 8 per cent of the Foreign Service officer po sitions in each significantly sized mis sion, with not less than one position  per mission.  We have many fine linguists in our  Foreign Service. Often, we aren't using  their talents as we should.  ",1994
46,Senate,103,0.52,500,1,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I wish  to compliment my friend and colleague  from New York for his statement in  this matter. I happen to concur with  his statement on this issue.  I would also like to compliment Sen ator DOLE  for  basically  expressing  some of the concerns that are needed  to be expressed by this body.  STATEMENT OF SENATOR HATCH  REGARDING ms SENSE-OF-THE SEN ATE  RESOLUTION  ON  REC OGNITION OF ISRAEL  At the request of Senator D'AMATO,  the following statement, and a sense of-the-Senate resolution, were ordered  to be printed in the RECORD:  ",1994
47,Senate,103,0.382,500,1,Mr. HATCH.," Mr.  President,  this  amendment  is  simple  and  straight forward.  It urges  the Department of  State  to  request  that  recipients of  American foreign assistance recognize  Israel. I do not believe that the State  Department has done enough to bring  down  the diplomatic walls  that con tinue  to  isolate Israel, and it is my  hope that this amendment serves as a  catalyst for action.  Israel has existed since May 1948, yet  49  countries have  failed  to  recognize  her legitimate right to exist. Of this  number, 32 countries receive some form  of assistance from  the United States.  These states are shown on the map. It  is imperative  that these countries in  particular understand the  importance  that the United States attaches to its  relationship with Israel.  In fact,  it is  time  that  the  inter national community treat Israel with  the respect it deserves. Israel has ex isted for almost 46 years and  is  the  most willing partner in the peace proc ess.  It should be  commended  rather  than condemned and ignored by mem bers of the international community.  In 1992 alone, China and India both  recognized Israel.  I  should point out  that  I am pleased  that Madagascar,  which is on this map, decided to estab lish diplomatic ties with Israel begin ning yesterday. Unfortunately, a large  number of states have failed to follow  their lead.  During the past 2 years, I have per sonally sent letters with a number of  my colleagues to the leaders of Indo nesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh  re questing  them  to  recognize  Israel.  I  have  appealed personally  to  ambas sadors of these countries. It is hard for  me  to understand how  the PLO can  enter into negotiations with Israel and  yet these countries refuse to establish  ties with Israel.  I do not understand why Indonesia,  the  largest Moslem  country  in  the  world, is unable to establish diplomatic  relations with Israel. I do not under stand why Pakistan is unable to do so.  I do not understand precisely why Ban gladesh, which has received substantial  American aid during a series of natural  disasters, denies one of our most im portant allies the most basic and fun damental right accorded to a state.  I do not understand why Kuwait-a  country that the United States helped  liberate from Iraqi aggression-has not  recognized Israel. While Kuwait does  not receive direct American aid at this  point,  it was  the most direct bene ficiary of the Persian Gulf war.  Most important, I do not understand  why the State Department is not doing  more in this area. The United States  will provide over $523 million to 32 of  these countries that do not recognize  Israel. I believe that every U.S. Ambas sador in such a country should be re quired to raise this issue with the host  government.  I believe  that only then will  these  countries get  the message  that  the  United States  is  serious about  this  matter.  The amendment to be proposed reads  as follows:  AMENDMENT NO.(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate  regarding Israel's diplomatic status)  At the appropriate place in the bill, insert  the following:  SEC.  .

51,House,103,0.548,604,1,Mr. KYL.," Mr. Speaker, a new survey  released by the Department of Heal th  and Human Services of 51,000  high  school  students  and  eighth-graders  shows drug use on the rise for the first  time in over a decade. The Clinton ad ministration has sent a confusing mes sage about drugs,  and our Nation's  teenagers are paying the price. The ad ministration must make it clear that  drug use  is dangerous and Congress  needs  to back  that message up with  tough legislation.  During the past year, through letters  to drug czar Lee Brown and to Presi dent Clinton, and through House Gov ernment Operations Committee hear ings on crime, I have urged the admin istration to commit greater resources  to fighting the war on drugs.  The priorities of the Clinton adminis tration unfortunately do not  include  promoting  a  tough,  active antidrug  strategy-the administration did not  even appoint a drug czar until July last  year and cut staffing for ONDCP by 80  percent.  The administration is trying to cut  back on drug interdiction-last year it  proposed cutting $200 million for De partment of Defense drug interdiction  efforts-particularly efforts  to catch  cocaine  smuggled  into  this  country  from South America. This also sends  the wrong message and places undue  burden on State and local police who  are trying to wage a war on drugs with  scarce resources.  Meanwhile, hardcore drug use is up  and cocaine and other drugs continue  to flow across our borders. Instead of  sending a message of retreat, our Na tion needs  to  reinvigorate our war  against drugs. Along with other Repub licans,  I have  introduced  the Crime  Control  Act,  which,  among  other  anticrime  initiatives,  enhances  sen tences  for  drug-related  crimes, will  help keep drug dealers off the street  and will impose the death penalty for  drug kingpins. We  owe our Nation's  youngsters no less.  AMERICA'S  GOAL  IN  HEALTH  CARE REFORM: TO PROVIDE SE CURITY  FOR AMERICAN  FAMI LIES  (Mr. RICHARDSON asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1994
52,House,103,-0.321,604,1,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, a  constituent of mine from Santa Fe re cently wrote to me that she was work ing full time, but her employer consid ers her part  time,  to  avoid paying  health insurance.  Health care reform is about finding a  way for employees  to  receive health  benefits  and  enjoy  the  security  of  knowing that he or she and their fam ily always will have health coverage in  all circumstances.  Mr. Speaker, Republicans are saying  that health care reform is not a prob lem. First they said there was no cri sis. Now  they are saying maybe they  want to work with us on health care re form. Now  they are politicizing  the  survey about drug use among adoles cents, a survey that basically was com pleted early on in the Clinton adminis tration.  Mr. Speaker, it does not help to po liticize our antidrug efforts. It does not  help to politicize the health care issue.  Let us get on with health care reform  and keep the politics out of it.  The debate on health care  reform  must not stumble on how we get to re form but what we have when we get  there. We must remember that people  should not have to suffer from ridicu lous concerns such as whether they are  considered  part-time  or  full-time.  Without health care reform, American  families will still have some fear of an  avoidable health crisis. Our underlying  goal in health care reform should be to  eliminate that fear.  honor his loyalty and commitment to  the United States of America.  Mr. Speaker, with great respect and  deepest sincerity, I humbly honor Lt.  John Vincent  Power, Congressional  Medal of Honor recipient, on the 50th  anniversary of his heroic deeds.  Mr. Speaker, for the record I include  a citation commending First Lieuten ant Power for his actions:  CITATION FOR lST LT. JOHN V. POWER  For conspicuous gallantry and intrepid! ty  at the risk of his life above and beyond the  call of duty as platoon leader attached to the  Fourth Marine Division during the landing  and the battle of Namur Island, Kwajalien  Atoll, Marshall Islands, February l, 1944. Se verely wounded in the stomach while setting  a demolition charge on a Japanese pillbox,  First Lieutenant Power was steadfast in his  determination to remain in action. Protect ing his wound with his left hand and firing  with his right, he courageously advanced as  another hostile position was taken under at tack, fiercely charging the opening made by  the explosion and emptying his carbine into  the pillbox. While attempting to reload and  continue the attack, First Lieutenant Power  was shot again in the stomach and head and  collapsed  in  the doorway. His exceptional  valor,  fortitude,  and  indomitable  fighting  spirit in the face of withering enemy fire  were in keeping with the highest traditions  of the United States Naval Service. He gal lantly gave his life for his country.  TRIBUTE TO lST LT.

53,House,103,0.192,604,1,Mr. BLUTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to an outstanding  American who made the supreme sac rifice for his country during World War  II.  Fifty years ago today, as a platoon  leader attached to the Fourth Marine  Division during the landing and Battle  of Namur Island, Kwajalein Atoll, Mar shall  Islands,  1st Lt.  John Vincent  Power gave his life in an unselfish act  of gallantry and valor above and be yond the call of duty.  While  attempting  to  disable  an  enemy position, Lieutenant Power was  severely wounded. Despite his wounds  he continued  the effort,  fiercely and  courageously  charging  the  position  until felled by enemy fire.  For his valiant and brave efforts,  Lieutenant Power  received  the Con gressional  Medal  of  Honor  post humously.  Mr. Speaker, this fine American was  born and raised in Worcester, MA, the  seat of my congressional district. He  attended the College of the Holy Cross  and joined the Marine Corps after the  attack on Pearl Harbor.  This Saturday, Lieutenant Power's  sisters, Mary Chandley and Patricia  Rose, will gather with friends and com rades at Holy Cross  for a memorial  mass and to present his Medal of Honor  and citation to the College of the Holy  Cross for display so that others may  TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. McCartney, a community activist,  is the last of eight children born to Lil lian and Leon McCartney. He has been  and is a major contributor to the com munity of Overtown. Mr. McCartney  may be best known for his eloquence in  reciting great works of literature, how ever, his most outstanding contribu tions  are  from working behind  the  scenes. Of the many contributions that  he has made to greater Miami,  three  McCartney activities have had,  and  will continue to have positive impacts  on the people for years to come.  First, there is the Edison Park Ele mentary I-95 Overpass. As a result of  the relentless efforts of Mr. McCartney,  the Edison Park Elementary I-95 Over pass was constructed. Young children  no longer have to face the death-defy ing temptations of taking a short-cut  across I-95 to get to school.  Second, the U.S. Department of De fense Race Relations Institute. Because  of the success of this program,  those  individuals who  came  through  the  Miami experience have a much more  significant  appreciation  and  under standing of their role in making Amer ica and the military a better place for  all.  ",1994
55,House,103,0.453,617,1,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Louisiana for his kind  remarks. I cannot tell him how much I  appreciate his support. Again,  the bi partisan fashion in which this is being  offered, because we have a real problem  and we need real solutions. We should  have this issue discussed on the floor of  the House of Representatives.  I know that Members are under a tre mendous amount of pressure, that var ious individuals in high positions have  contacted them in support of defeating  the position I have taken here, that to morrow we expect the Vice President  to come up and meet with the freshmen  Democrat Members and arms will be  twisted. But I am asking Members to  hold strong and that we also,  in the  best interests of the American people,  that we address this issue, that if we do  nothing else in our terms, whether it is  one term or 10 terms in Congress, that  we seek to improve the question of reg ulatory reform, which has become such  a burden.  Before the gentleman had added his  support, I was giving the House several  areas in which I felt that there are just  almost humorous and, actually, it can not be humorous, because it is so cost ly to the taxpayer, but frivolous man dates and regulations that are set forth  by EPA.  For example, under the Safe Drink ing Water Act, every water system in  the Nation is required to monitor for  DBCP,  the herbicide  used  on  pine apples, which are grown only in Ha waii, unless a  specific waiver  is ob tained.  The waiver is expensive and difficult  for  the water system and expensive,  again, for the State, which has to judge  the merits of the waiver application  and tailor its program accordingly.  Look at the hoops that we make our  local  governments  go  through,  our  water supply systems, and the expense  this adds to the people's water bills and  their utility bills and just the cost to  business and industry which is astro nomical.  What is interesting is, with all the  things  that EPA  regulates,  because  they are unfocused, because  they do  not have a risk assessment policy in  place that is working, examples  like  the contaminant that we just recently  had  in  the water in Washington and  also is responsible for the death of 40  people in Milwaukee and drove a mil lion residents in the Washington area  to drink only bottled water for 4 days,  that particular chemical contaminant  is not regulated by EPA.  In a 1986  law, Congress set forth 83  other specific chemical contaminants  that are required to regulate, but the  one that has caused death and incon venience and tremendous expense they  do not regulate. So again, we have ex ample after example of an agency out  of control.  I  would  like  to  submit  for  the  RECORD  additional examples of EPA  regulatory craziness and costliness to  the American taxpayers. Again, tomor row we had an opportunity to be heard  on  this  issue. Again,  I do not stand  here alone in support of this. I do have  many colleagues that support me and  many associations who support me.  As  I mentioned,  the National Gov ernors Association, which, of course, is  a bipartisan organization, is in favor of  conducting risk assessment for new en vironmental  regulations. They  faxed  me a  copy of their recommendation,  and their recommendation reads:  It is recommended that the federal envi ronmental policy be based on a clear set of  priorities and that the Federal Government  commit to certain principles when adopting  new environmental mandates.  This  is  just the beginning of their  recommendation and their support of a  risk assessment, which I will also sub mit for the RECORD.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, in a  resolution adopted June 22, 1993, said,  ""Be it further resolved that the United  States Conference of Mayors calls on  the Congress and the President to per form risk assessment and cost benefit  analysis on all  legislation which re quires mandates on State and  local  governments.''  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, inter estingly enough, I have another document here on the stationery of the mu nicipality of Anchorage, and this letter  was sent to Senator JOHNSTON in sup port of his amendment.  It says, ""Mayors from 49 States have  signed this letter because we need your  help. Something must be done early in  the 103d Congress to assure that envi ronmental protection investments are  made where they accomplish the great est good."" And here I have the names  of numerous Mayors  throughout  the  Nation.  The National Association of Coun ties, one of the most prestigious orga nizations in. the United States, at the  root of  local government,  that  rep resents over 3,000 counties across this  great Nation, sent a letter to my col league, the gentleman from Massachu setts [Mr. MOAKLEY], chairman of the  Rules Committee, urging him to allow  the Mica amendment to be offered as  part of the EPA Cabinet level elevation  bill. They explained in their letter how  they are drowning in regulations and  that my amendment, the Mica amend ment, would offer them some hope.  Here is what they said in their letter,  again, on behalf of over 3,000 county  governments, which attempt daily  to  comply with the vast number of envi ronmental mandates.  We support the Mica amendment. Repeat edly, county officials inform us of regulatory  requirements promulgated by EPA that are  based on  inadequate scientific analysis or  that fail to assess the minuscule risk being  addressed compared to the enormous cost of  reducing those risks further.  Again, I will submit this letter for  the RECORD.  0 1850  In a  letter to me on November 17,  1993,  the National Federation of Inde pendent Business expressed their sup port for the so-called Mica amendment.  ""Environmental regulations are killing  on our small businessmen."" They re cently  conducted  a  survey of  their  members and discussed the results of  that survey in their letter. Listen to  what they said. This is November 17,  just a few months ago.  Risk assessment is an essential element in  creating sound environmental policy. A  re cent field survey ranked environmental reg ulation as the fourth largest problem faced  by small business owners. While NFIB mem bers are clearly supportive of a clean and  healthy  environment,  they are  concerned  about the increasing number of regulatory  initiatives being issued without a compara tive cost-benefit analysis.

I want to make  sure the RECORD  is absolutely clear in  terms of what it was that I said a few  minutes ago, when I confirmed or af firmed my belief that the Senator from  Wyoming does not harbor the kind of  ""anti"" feeling suggested by anti-Semi tism or anti-any other group.

57,Senate,103,-0.266,682,1,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  the  amendment I am offering is a simple  one. What it says is that the President  should consider the effects of the trans fers of excess defense articles on our in dustrial base before we proceed with  the transfers.  This amendment  in a very similar  form was adopted last year by the Sen ate Armed Services Committee and in cluded in the fiscal year 1994 Defense  Authorization Act which was reported  to the full Senate. It was adopted by  our committee  in  response  to  testi mony we received from  industry that  these transfers were in some instances  directly competing with the undercut ting U.S.  industry efforts to sell new  equipment. I would ask that an excerpt  from the Armed Services Committee's  report  (Senate  report 10:>-112)  be  in cluded at this point in my statement.  There being no objection, the excerpt  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, As follows:  LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER  EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES  The drawdown of U.S. armed forces around  the world has resulted in a large amount of  excess m111tary  equipment. At  the  same  time, funding for security assistance is de clining. These  factors. have  led  to more  transfers of excess equipment on a grant or  low cost basis to eligible countries under sec tions 516, 517, 518, and 519 of the Foreign As sistance Act of 1961.  The committee supports the transfer of ex cess  defense  articles  to U.S.  allies  and  friends as a cost-effective means of realizing  security benefits from the transfer of equip ment that is no longer needed by U.S. mili tary forces. In fact, in 1986,  the com.'Tli ttee  initiated  the  so-called  ""Southern Flank""  amendment (section 516 of the Foreign As sistance Act of 1961).  However, at this time, the number and size  of these transfers are substantial enough to  compete directly with U.S.  industry efforts  to sell new equipment. The transfer of excess  equipment  can  undercut  new  equipment  sales which strengthen  the national  tech nology and  industrial base, maintain  jobs,  and reduce the unit costs of equipment pur chased by the Defense Department. Both the  sale of new equipment and the transfer of ex cess  equipment  offer  important  benefits;  however, the U.S. government does not ap pear to systematically consider the effect of  transferring  excess  defense  articles  to  a  country upon any U.S. industry efforts that  might be underway to sell new equipment to  the  same  country. The  committee  rec ommends a provision that would require the  President  to  consider,  on  a  case-by-case  basis, the effects of a transfer of excess de fense articles on the national technology and  industrial base.

I am very  proud to join the township of Nutley in honor ing and thanking this organization for its dec ades of service.  The Nutley Fire Department was originally  founded on March 5, 1894, when  the  town  was known as Franklin Township. The original  company was known as Yantacaw Hose Com pany and, in fact, the original hose cart is still  in  the department. A second company was  formed on April 5, 1895, and the final volun teer company, West Nutley Hose No. 2, was  formed on March 14, 1906.  Over the next few years, several volunteer  firefighters became paid drivers assigned  to  their respective companies.  In 1938, the paid  company was formally established with mem bers becoming civil service employees.  Today, the Nutley Fire Department is one of  only two volunteer departments in New Jersey  with a paid contingency. Under the leadership  of Chief Larry Lampariello and Executive Offi cer Charlie Kucinski, Jr., the Nutley Fire De partment provides  the  town's  residents with  first-class fire protection a minimal cost.  For the past 100 years, the township of Nut ley has benefited from the service of the Nut ley Fire Department.

The  Contemporary Club  recently marked  its his toric 1 OOth birthday with a gala birthday cele bration, a day of reflection and reminiscence  on a century of community  leadership and  goodwill.  The Contemporary Club was established on  January 3, 1894 in Redlands. Two years later,  the  club  joined  the General Federation of  Women's Clubs,  International-today  recog nized as the world's largest nonpolitical, non partisan organization of volunteer women.  The outstanding work of the Contemporary  Club  is well known. Since  its establishment,  the Contemporary Club's guiding vision has  centered upon providing service to our com munity. Over the years, it has recognized the  most urgent needs of our citizens and taken  whatever steps necessary to ensure that these  needs are met. While the accomplishments of  the club are too numerous to mention, suffice  it  to say  that a number of our community's  most  trusted and  respected  institutions-the  Joslyn Senior Center, the Redlands Day Nurs ery,  the Historical Society,  the Meals  on  Wheels Program, the Smiley Library, and oth ers-would not be as successful  today  if  it  were not  for  the uncompromising dedication  and support of the Contemporary Club.  The club's commitment to providing scholar ships to high school seniors, raising money for  many worthy projects in the city of Redlands,  and  its  support  for  numerous  community  based organizations is indicative of the quality  of  its membership. The Contemporary Club  has made a positive contribution  to almost  every conceivable organization and  touched  the lives of people of all ages. All of us who  make Redlands and  the  Inland Empire our  home are grateful beyond words for its com mitment and dedication.

Their behavior is shameful.  It is  life-threat ening. It could result in the death of vulnerable  senior citizens.  I urge my constituents  to avoid  this com pany and its sales pitches at all cost.  Followng  is a  letter  I've  received  from an  outstanding community health center called  the ""Over 60 Health Center"" of Berkeley, CA.  Recently, one of our long time clients, an  83 year old woman who is residing at a local  nursing home and suffering from dementia,  was  signed up  for Aetna's risk HMO. We  learned about  the problem when payment  was denied  to Over 60 after our physician  went  to visit her patient  in  the nursing  home.  We called the patient's niece who reported  that she knew nothing about her aunt join ing an HMO. The nursing home also claimed  to know nothing about it, although they did  admit to allowing the HMO to make a pres entation to their residents. It appears that  this woman, suffering from dementia, was in vited to sign up at the presentation, and did  so.

But what is it this time? A bipartisan  coalition  of Republican  and Demo cratic Members wants  to  offer  an  amendment to the EPA bill that would  require a cost-benefit analysis before  imposing any new unfunded mandates  on State and local taxpayers. The Unit ed States Senate has already passed  this measure by a vote of 95 to 3, and  public opinion polls  indicate  that 92  percent of the American people are in  favor of it.  But what is the Democratic leader ship's response? ""No way. The amend ment  is out of order."" The people's  House will not even be permitted to  vote on it.

64,House,103,0.176,747,1,Mr. CLINGER.," Mr. Speaker, State  and local governments have high hopes  that 1994 will bring real relief from the  burdens of unfunded Federal mandates.  This week our Nation's Governors are  in town and the No. 1 topic of conversa tion is how do we get Congress to pro vide us with relief.  It is  timely then that for  the first  time we will discuss the issue of un funded mandates on the floor if we con sider H.R. 3425, the Department of En vironmental Protection Act of 1993.  A survey conducted by the U.S. Con ference of Mayors shows that of the top  10 unfunded Federal mandates, 8 are  environmental. Costs to cities, which  does not  include costs  to States or  small local governments, is projected  to be more  than $50 billion over the  next 4 years. Often these costs are sim ply passed onto taxpayers.  All of us support protection of human  health and the environment. However,  State and local governments are going  bankrupt  trying  to  implement every  environmental regulation without any  flexibility or fiscal support.  I will offer an amendment  to H.R.  3425 as a first step to help State and  local governments. My amendment di rects the new Department to promote a  strategy,  consistent  with  environ mental laws, to ease the burden of un funded environmental mandates. The  Secretary would identify areas of flexi bility where it exists as well as any  other means to assist State and local  governments.  Let me repeat,  the amendment re quires that the strategy must be con sistent with  environmental  laws  so  that all environmental  requirements  must still be met. The strategy would  promote effective alternatives of State  and  local governments struggling  to  comply with rigid, complex mandates  which dictate not only what they must  do, but also how they must do it.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  carefully  examine  and  support  this  common sense amendment. Let us take  a step in the right direction  towards  helping State and  local government  with these burdens.  MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT  A message in writing from the Presi dent of the United States was commu nicated  to  the House by Mr. Edwin  Thomas, one of his secretaries.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  MCCANDLESS]  another  very  distin guished member of the committee.  0 1610  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr. Speaker, if  EPA is to be elevated to Cabinet sta tus, in spite of all its much discussed  and highly publicized  internal prob lems, then the Mica-Thurman amend ment must be part of  it. We  could  spend the rest of this week trading hor ror stories about well-intentioned envi ronmental regulations gone haywire in  each and every one of our own dis tricts.  In my part of  the California  desert, a much needed project to im prove and widen the State's deadliest  two-lane highway, a project which was  two-thirds  complete,  was  abruptly  halted over a year ago. The EPA de cided that wetlands may possibly exist  near  the project site. These alleged  wetlands, if they do exist, are the re sult of agricultural runoff. In the 13  months  since  construction  was  stopped, another 10 lives have been lost  on Highway 86. Will  the road be fin ished one day? Probably. Will it have  been worth  the  trade-off  in human  lives? Not even close. But  this risk  equation is not considered by EPA in  current practice. In fact, the Agency's  priorities are so backwards, it is hard  to believe  that we are even arguing  over whether it should adopt risk as sessment and risk management.  Risk  assessment  is  not  anti environment. Witness  the  shameful  squandering  of  lives  and  resources  which is too often brought about by a  lack of coherence and pragmatism in  environmental regulation. Given this, I  resent  the wailing about  the alleged  ""difficulties""  the  risk  assessment  amendment would cause. Mr. Speaker,  I spend a great deal of time dealing  with  the negative effects of environ mental regulation on my constituency.  I do not see how factoring in risk as sessment  could  be  anything but  a  change for the better.  ",1994

Mr. Speaker, I agree that it is time  that we raised the Environmental Pro tection Agency to Cabinet level rank.  Environmental protection policy does  not exist in and of itself separately and  apart  from  everything  else we  are  doing. Quite the contrary. It ought to  be an integral part of all of our other  decisions, which is why the present Ad ministrator should be of Cabinet level  and should be  seated with  the other  Cabinet level officials.  It is with regret, however, that I ask  this House  to defeat the rule that is  proposed before us. The main reason is,  although  certain  amendments  have  ",1994
67,House,103,-0.589,773,1,Mr. LEWIS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to take a few minutes of this  Special Order to speak about a  tragic  incident that took place in my district  a week ago Tuesday. A young man  named Brandon Williams was fatally  wounded in a shooting that followed a  high school basketball game. He was 17  years old.  He was  the son of Dr.  Joseph and  Mrs. Sharon Williams. His paternal  grandfather is a retired professor, who  taught at Morehouse College for nearly  40 years. He had a brother and sister,  Keven Williams and Jaron Williams Gilstrap. Brandon's family is one of the  most respected families in Atlanta. His  father is a physician and his mother is  a nurse.  Brandon loved sports. He began play ing baseball at the age of 4. He spent  every summer on the baseball field. As  a student, he earned three varsity let ters  in  baseball  and  football  at  Riverwood High School. He  also en joyed tennis and golf. He began swim ming and diving at the age of 2. He was  a  certified  lifeguard  for  the Atlanta  Department of Parks and Recreation.  Brandon Williams was a very kind  and loving individual. He always had a  very beautiful smile. He was to grad uate from Riverwood High School this  spring and attend Morehouse College  on a full scholarship.  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that  I was deeply saddened and emotionally  shaken by the death of young Brandon  Williams. He was one of  the nicest  young people you would ever want to  meet.  I have known his  family and  grandparents for more  than 30 years.  He was a close friend of my 17-year-old  son. They attended the seventh, eighth,  and ninth grades  together. On many  occasions, my wife would drop BranI  don, my son and his first cousin off at  movies, or to get a pizza. On one occa sion he traveled to Florida with my son  and wife and several young people.  knew him well.  This  young man will  be  deeply  missed by his  family, by all of his  friends and all of his schoolmates. The  people of Atlanta and the Fifth Con gressional District of Georgia have lost  a distinguished young citizen. Finally,  Mr. Speaker, we can only do so much  as elected officials. There are  some  things that have to be done as citizens  and elected officials. We have to start  looking out for all young people.  As I have said in the past, the vio lence and the killing must stop. There  must be a revolution of values, a revo lution in the spirit and hearts of our  people.

70,,103,-0.332,903,1,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, the inter national tribunal for the prosecution of  war crimes committed  in the former  Yugoslavia is currently meeting in The  Hague. This is a fact of great signifi cance for the rule of law and the pros pects  for peace  in  this area of  the  world. I applaud the leadership Ambas sador Albright and the Clinton admin istration have shown at the United Na tions in the creation of this important  tribunal.  The tribunal has three fundamental  goals. First, it is intended to deter the  committal of  further  crimes  in  the  former Yugoslavia. Second, it has the  responsibility  to bring  to  justice  the  persons responsible  for  those crimes.  Finally, by providing for prosecution  and  judgment under  the rule of faw,  the tribunal will contribute to the res toration and maintenance of peace.  The  tribunal convened for  the first  time  on November 17,  1993,  in The  Hague. During  this first, 2-week ses sion, the court's 11  judges elected An tonio Cassese of Italy as their Presi dent, and Mrs. Odio Benito of Costa  Rica as  their Vice President.  I  am  pleased  to  note  that  an American,  Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, was  chosen as President of one of the tribu nal's two trial chambers. Also during  this first session, the judges proceeded  to examine the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence and set their agenda for 1994.  The  tribunal's second session began  on January 17. The main  issue cur rently being considered at this session  is the Rules of Procedure. The tribunal  expects to be able to come to a final  determination on this issue and to be  in a position to conduct trials by late  spring. Meanwhile, the prosecutor's of fice set up under th~ tribunal hopes to  be  fully operational by  the  end  of  April. I hope the tribunal and the pros ecutor can quickly  resolve any out standing procedural and organizational  issues  so  that  they can begin  their  work as soon as possible.  On a personal note, I want to men tion that my father, the late.Herbert C.  Pell, a former congressman from New  York City, and a former U.S. Minister,  was  President  Franklin Roosevelt's  representative on the U.N. War Crimes  Commission that recommended estab lishment of the Nuremberg Tribunal.  There was  opposition  to  this  rec ommendation at the time, and my fa ther fought hard to assure that the his toric World War  II  tribunals would  come into being.  Mr.  President,  while  substantial  progress has been made in establishing  the current tribunal, much remains to  be done. My biggest concern with re gard to the tribunal's ability to func tion effectively is its ability to obtain  custody of suspected violators of inter national law. At the end of World War  II, the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals  were established following the decisive  military defeat of the offending par ties. In the case of the former Yugo slavia, no such defeat appears  immi nent.  I am encouraged by the provision of  the Tribunal statute which states that  the Tribunal will be endowed with the  power to call for measures through the  Security Council which,  failing vol untary cooperation of member States,  would ensure compliance with its re quests of judicial assistance.  Nevertheless,  in  the  face of resist ance  from parties  to  the conflict,  it  will be difficult for the Prosecutor to  make arrests. This makes it imperative  that the United States and the other  U.N. members maintain a strong com mitment to the Tribunal, and that we  place unswerving pressure on the war ring  factions  to comply with appro priate U.N. war crimes resolutions.  Madeleine Albright,  the American  Ambassador to the United Nations, visited The Hague on  January 16  and  called  on governments  to  ""consider  what  resources-financial,  material,  personnel,  investigatory-they  can  contribute  to  the  important work of  the Tribunal in the months and years  ahead."" Specifically, she urged States  to make relevant information in their  possession available to the United Na tions,  and  she  encouraged countries  which have taken in refugees from the  conflict  to arrange  for  them  to be  interviewed if they have witnessed war  crimes.  I hope that the international  community  will  heed  Ambassador  Albright's call to support the Tribunal.  For its part, the United States has  done more than any other government  to  assist  the Tribunal. Ambassador  Albright announced in The Hague that  the United States will soon deliver to  the Tribunal about 900 reports of inter views with refugees. The administra tion also plans to contribute $3 million  for the start-up costs of the Tribunal  and to begin drawing down some of the  $25 million authorized for the Tribunal  by Public Law 103--87. In addition, Am bassador Albright announced that the  United States is willing to contribute a  substantial number of expert personnel  at no cost  to  the United Nations.  I  commend the administration for these  efforts and hope the will set an exam ple for others.  The United States has named as war  criminals  several  leaders  from  the  former Yugoslavia,  including some of  the same people who are currently in volved in U.N.-sponsored peace negotia tions. Some have argued that the es tablishment of a war crimes Tribunal  complicates these peace efforts by pre cluding a possible concession of am nesty to leaders accused of crimes. I  believe this view misses the point. The  real problem is not that the Tribunal  undermines the peace  talks, but that  we are forced to discuss a peace settle ment with the perpetrators of heinous  atrocities.  Peace cannot be separated from jus tice. Unless the persons responsible for  the outrageous crimes being commit ted are brought to justice, any peace  agreement will remain hollow. A genu ine and lasting peace will come to the  lands of  the  former Yugoslavia only  with  the  restoration  of  respect  for  international  law and human rights,  which  provide  the  basis  for  inter national peace and stability.  In this context, I remain hopeful that  a real peace accord can be reached that  will put an end to the crimes and the  killing. I believe that the United Na tions war crimes Tribunal, if allowed  to  function properly,  can contribute  significantly to the conclusion of such  an agreement.  At this point I ask unanimous con sent that Ambassador Albright's state ment of January 16 be entered into the  RECORD.  ",1994
71,,103,-0.262,955,1,Mr. TORRICELLI.," Mr. Speaker,  there  is a  growing public health crisis  in America today  that most Americans do not even realize. A  crisis that is significant for its financial impact  on this country, and more  importantly for the  toll it is taking in human lives.  An estimated 9,000 Americans die each  year and another 6.5 million become sick from  bacterial  foodborne  illnesses. That  is  far,  far  too many for a nation that prides itself on hav ing one of the world's safest food supplies. In  addition,  the Food and Drug Administration  and  the Food Safety and  Inspection Service  estimate  that  foodborne  illnesses  cost  the  United States between $6 and $23 billion an nually in medical expenses and lost productiv ity.  Last week I introduced the Katie O'Connell  Safe Food Act, a comprehensive bill  to  re vamp .the way meat and poultry inspection ,js  953  conducted  in  this country.  In addition,  it will  spur  the  implementation of new,  scientific  methods to improve our ability to detect patho gens during the inspection process.  My interest in this issue intensified 2 months  ago, when I had the honor of meeting an ex traordinary man,  Arthur O'Connell,  and  I  learned of his tragic story.  ,  Mr. O'Connell is a constituent of mine from  Kearny, NJ. He is a dedicated family man and  a  hard-working  high  school mathematics  teacher. One day, Mr. O'Connell's 23-month  old daughter, Katie, did what millions of other  children across  this country do every day she ate lunch at a fast food restaurant. Less  than 3 weeks later, after a horrible illness that  attacked each of her organs one by one, Katie  O'Connell died. The cause of death was he molytic uremic syndrome, an illness caused by  the presence of E. Coli bacteria in the ham burger she ate.  With no warning, and with no opportunity for  prevention, the O'Connells lost a healthy and  vivacious toddler. Few events in my 11 years  in Congress have moved me so deeply as  Artie O'Connell's testimony and my later con versation with him. We can, we must, and we  will do better.  What  is most tragic about Mr. O'Connell's  loss is that it could have been prevented. The  story of Katie O'Connell represents an  inex cusable  failure of government  to protect  its  citizens. Nobody can disagree that one thing  we can and must expect from our government  is a sate and healthy food supply.  Currently, meat and poultry  inspection  is  performed by  the U.S. Department of Agri culture. I do not believe this is the most appro priate agency to be in charge of this vital pub lic health function. Meat and poultry inspection  is a public health  issue and deserves  to be  handled by an agency staffed by public health  experts, and dedicated  first and  foremost  to  the preservation of the public health.  The Food Safety and Inspection Service, an  agency within  the USDA,  is  responsible  for  meat and poultry inspection. FSIS falls under  the Assistant Secretary for Marketing and  In spection Service. This  simple  bureaucratic  structuring points to the heart of the problem.  Congress has directed the USDA to increase  agricultural production and to promote the sale  of agricultural products.  It also directs  the  USDA  to  promote  and  protect  the  public  health by rigid inspection of meat and poultry  products. This is an inherent conflict of inter est.  Vice President GORE has  recognized  this  conflict and has  recommended moving meat  and poultry  inspection  responsibilities out of  USDA and into the Food and Drug Administra tion. While I do not agree that the FDA is the  best place  for  these  responsibilities,  I com pletely agree that the time has come to move  meat and poultry inspection to an agency that  is dedicated  first and  foremost  to protecting  the health of American consumers. The Katie  O'Connell Safe Food Act would move meat,  poultry, and egg  inspection responsibilities to  a new executive branch agency, staffed by  public health experts and dedicated to promoting the public health.    My bill will also address the sorry state of  technology in the meat and poultry inspection  field. Currently, there is a surprising and dan",1994
72,,103,-0.39,968,1,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I want to call at tention to the fine work performed by the Coa lition  for a Better Acre and Enterprise Bank  and Trust  in  the development of my home town, Lowell, MA. CBA and Enterprise are  being  recognized by  the Social Compact  in  conjunction with  the 1993 Outstanding Com munity Investment Awards program, which fo cuses national attention on outstanding efforts  to strengthen disadvantaged neighborhoods.  The Coalition  for a Better Acre  [CBA]  is  Lowell's only community-based nonprofit de velopment  organization.  Its  Hispanic  empowerment  and  leadership  project  and  Southeast Asian organizing project help local  residents strengthen their communities and re vitalize  their neighborhoods. The Enterprise  Development Center focuses on  the creation  and retention of local jobs by supporting the  smallest and  newest business ventures  in  high-growth sectors of  the economy.  In  the  field of affordable housing, the CBA has devel oped nearly 400 residential units for low-and  moderate-income people.  The Acre community  in Lowell  is one of  New England's most diverse-and poorest communities, with nearly 85 percent of  its  15,000 residents  living  in poverty. With thou sands of jobs lost in the Lowell area since the  beginning of  the  recession  in 1989, home  businesses,  self-employment  ventures,  and  microsized enterprises have exploded in num ber and represent a critical source of income  for the urban poor in the Acre and provide a  realistic alternative to minimum wage jobs and  welfare.  With the help of Enterprise Bank and Trust,  CBA created the Minority Enterprise Develop ment Assistance  Initiative  [MEDAi]  in 1992.  MEDAi is based on a microenterprise develop ment model created by the Grameen Bank in  Bangladesh. The program offers $500 working  capital  loans  to  individuals who  form peer  groups of up to seven members. To be eligible  for  participation  in MEDAi,  peer members  must be currently living on some type of public  assistance. As a group, the members review  each other's business plans and then approve  and cosign each other's  loans. Loans grad uate up to $1,500 when members stay current  on payments.  Enterprise played a lead role in capitalizing  the experimental MEDAi peer loan program by  pledging $25,000. In addition, the chief execu tive officer and assistant vice president ac tively participated in the planning and develop ment of  the program and continue  to offer  their advice and expertise on a regular basis.  CBA secured operating funds from the city  of Lowell, private foundations, and national reEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ligious philanthropic organizations,  including  the Theodore Edson Parker Foundation, Sun  Microsystems  Inc.,  the Marianist  Sharing  Fund, and  the Adrian Dominican Sisters.  In  addition to loan fund capital supplied by Enter prise,  loan pool  resources were committed  from five additional banks, the city of Lowell,  and religious philanthropies. In all, 11 different  sources of  funds were  found  to begin  the  MEDAi program.  This awards program is built upon a national  competition which seeks out the most innova tive and effective affordable housing, commu nity and/or economic development strategies  carried out by partnerships between financial  services  institutions and neighborhood-based  nonprofit organizations. With  the support of  the country's national nonprofit housing and  community  development  leadership,  almost  2,000 applications were distributed and 120  applications received. The award-winning part nerships are  representative of each of  the  types of  financial  services  institutions  rep resented  in  the pool of applicants. Each of  these nonprofit partners receives a grant aver aging $5,000 to further their work. The CBA/  Enterprise Bank and Trust partnership was  chosen as one of sixteen honorees in the Out standing Community Investment Awards com petition.  I think  the keen competition  for this  award speaks to the exemplary quality of work  by both the coalition and Enterprise in helping  restore the economic vitality of Lowell.  MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY'S  COMMUNITY REVIVAL PROJECT  HON. TOBY ROTH  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 2, 1994  On page 1 of the February 1 , 1994, edition  of the Wall Street Journal, Marquette Univer sity's community revival project proves to be a  model of university and  intercity community  cooperative  involvement.  As  a Marquette  alumnus, I am extremely proud of Marquette's  innovative  response  to  the  deterioration of  downtown Milwaukee.  Drugs, gangs, prostitution, and widespread  crime have flooded our cities. Instead of build ing walls around ourselves and  letting crimi nals rule our lives, we must deal with urban  problems-like Marquette  University  did head on.  Marquette's  campus  circle  project  joined  residents,  local  businesses,  community  churches, and other neighborhood groups  in  an effort to not only revitalize the area, but re capture a sense of community. Working with  the city, Marquette secured a mini area pre cinct staffed with 50 additional officers and  major crime has decreased by 34 percent.  This  is  the kind of resourceful  thinking our  country needs to deal with our domestic agen da. We must insist that drug dealers, rapists,  and other criminals are off the streets. They  cannot be permitted to take over our commu nities. I commend Marquette President Father  Albert DiUlio and the Marquette community for  their quest  for a safe and secure neighbor hood.  February 2, 1994  [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 1, 1994)  MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LEADS URBAN  REVIVAL OF BLIGHTED ENVIRONS  (By Joseph N. Boyce)  MILWAUKEE.-When the Rev. Albert DiUlio  arrived at Marquette University as president  in 1990, he faced a disturbing prospect: Mar quette and its 11,000 students might have to  wall themselves in for their own safety.  Gangs, drug dealers and prostitutes had  moved into Avenues West, a 100-square-block  area near downtown that has been home to  the Jesuit university for 113 years. Fear and  violence moved in with them. ""We were hav ing drive-by and stand-by shootings,"" says  Virginia Johnson, a community activist.  But instead of building a wall around the  university, Father DiUlio has led Marquette  in rebuilding the community. ""I could see  where we were going. I could see  the eco nomic consequences. And I could see the eco nomic potential of reversing the decline,"" he  says.  Marquette's situation exemplified a  town and-gown dilemma confronting many urban  colleges and universities. Built near city  centers on once-prime acreage, they now are  encircled by neighborhoods mired in crime,  decay and human misery. Security concerns  often compete with education for attention  and financial resources.  Some institutions have bailed out of the  cities.  In  the wake of  the Watts riots  in  South Central Los Angeles, Pepperdine left  the  area  for  Malibu,  Calif.,  in  1972.  Marquette's former medical school moved to  a suburb in the 1960s.  But now, many urban schools are no longer  trying to put distance between themselves  and their troubled surroundings. Instead, all  over the country, institutions have been get ting more involved in attacking problems in  their home turf.  PITCHING IN  The University of Southern California has  become involved in providing counseling, tu toring and college preparatory classes  for  children in South Central Los Angeles. Yale  has agreed to invest $50 million in improve ment projects  in New Haven, Conn.; while  more than half of its students are volunteer ing in local social service programs. And Illi nois Institute of Technology is getting more  involved in community revitalization efforts  on Chicago's South Side.  It  is  different  ""from the 1960s and 1970s, when the school  was trying to put in a buffer"" between itself  and  the community, says Leroy Kennedy,  IIT's vice president for community relations.  ""You can only run so far.""  In Milwaukee, Marquette has been steadily  increasing its presence in the Avenues West  community. Through  urban  renewal  and  other acquisitions, the campus has grown to  80 acres, from 26 acres in 1965.  In  the neighborhoods around  the univer sity, crime had been steadily rising over the  years, and occasionally spilled onto campus.  Three students became homicide victims be tween 1985 and 1991; two of the killings oc curred near the school.  Then Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested in July  1991  for multiple murders and cannibalism.  His apartment, where some of the victims'  remains were found, was just 10 blocks from  Marquette. Maps accompanying Dahmer sto ries often used the campus as a  reference  point.  FEWER FRESHMAN  Attendance at evening campus events fell.  Graduate students sought housing elsewhere.  Freshman enrollment, 2,113 in 1989, plunged  to 1,685 in 1993.

75,House,103,0.236,994,1,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Madam  Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for  yielding me this time.  Madam Chairman, I  rise  to address  what I think is a problem with what we  are trying to do here. Last month we  were all shocked  to  learn that  there  had been another earthquake in south ern California, and we were saddened  and further shocked when we began to  realize the magnitude, the thousands of  people  that were  affected,  the  lives  that were lost, the tremendous loss to  property including bridges, highways,  buildings.  In true American fashion, we came to  their assistance .. Churches started col lecting money, individuals sent money  to give assistance, we had help from  various government agencies including  Federal, State, and  local,  rushing  to  the.aid.  Last week,  the President sent a  re quest for just a  little under $7 billion  to give more help to those who were in  need. Yes, it is true, we have done this  before. We have always done  it  this  way or usually have done it this way.  Just after the  floods  in  the Midwest  last year, which affected me person ally, and I had a lot of friends affected  by the floods in the Midwest, I thought  it should be paid for, rush the aid to  them, but pay for it. We were promised  by many including, I understand,  the  President, who promised we would do  something about paying for it in the  future, and the Speaker talked about a  task force, and Leon Panetta, our col league,  the Director of Management  and Budget, said there would be some thing in place.  This has happened very quickly. But  if it is not now that we start being re sponsible, when? When are we going to  do it?  Now  since  the President  sent his  original request, this request for emer gency  appropriations  has  grown  by  more than 40 percent and is still grow ing.  We all recognize the emergency, but   as someone else mentioned here, we  have  a  hemorrhaging national  debt  which affects every  taxpayer  in  this  country. Our ability to help people in  the future, and there will be future dis asters unfortunately, but our ability to  affect them in the future is impacted  by  irresponsibility  if we do not cut  spending someplace else.  So today I say I am going to off er an  amendment, thanks to the rule, that is  a  responsible amendment. It does not  cut any program that is absolutely es sential to our country, and it does not  try to cut into programs that had been  provided for in the past in earthquakes  or other national emergencies.  I did notice that Loma Prieta was a  disaster 4¥2 years ago to a highway in  California. I am not singling out Cali fornia.  But this is an emergency bill. Who  has been driving on that highway? How  did we prepare  years ago  for an  earthquake? What has happened in the  41/2 years? It has never shown up, to my  knowledge,  in  an  appropriation  re quest.  This is just one example that if the  back door of the Treasury is open or  the cash  register  is open,  everybody  wants to rush in.  I think if not now, when? We hear in  this body of a responsibility, an obliga tion  to  the American  taxpayer, not  only the people of California, to be re sponsible.  Today is the day to start doing it.  41/2  ",1994
76,House,103,-0.254,994,1,Mr. CARR of Michigan.," Madam  Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for  yielding me this time.  Madam Chairman,  I  just want  to  highlight the fact that this bill has $1.6  billion in it for highway reconstruc tion, and I think we were all startled  by the visuals coming out of the TV  cameras  from California about high ways and  the Santa Monica Freeway  falling down and the other damage that  we saw to the infrastructure of Califor nia.  This bill will help repair that and do  it in a very quick manner.  The Committee met with  the Sec retary of Transportation, not in a for mal hearing, but in an extensive brief ing about these costs. We are going to  monitor  those as we go  through  the  year.  I want to point out as well that the  FEMA section contains $315 million for  transit. Under our practice, we have  FEMA contracting back to the Federal  Transit Administration the obligation  for granting out  the $315 million.  I  want to point out though that there is  one area of concern, and we are asking  FEMA not to waive any of the  laws  that would govern  labor-management  relations. Those laws are in place. We  see no need to waive them in an emer gency fashion.  The Federal Transit Administration  could not waive them, but because the  money  is  being  funneled  through  FEMA,  not directly  to  the Federal  Transit Administration,  there  is  a  worry that FEMA may try to waive the  laws  that relate  to  the relations be tween  labor and management  in  the  transit area. So we want to urge FEMA  not to waive those laws, section 13(c)  and section 3(e) of the Federal Transit  Act.  ",1994

80,House,103,0.585,1007,1,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Madam  Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Let me  restate one  thing, Madam  Chairman. I do not believe we should  cut the Department of Defense any fur ther. We have cut it too far already. I  believe we should keep a  strong na tional defense, but this is the vehicle  for this.  In addition to that, they are putting  all of these issues, all of these coun tries, and all of these problems in one  big bag, and saying, ""Take it or leave  it."" Some of these things I agree with.  Some of  these  expenditures  I  agree  with. Others I think are totally unnec essary  and  a  waste  of  taxpayers'  money.  That  is why  it should come down  here in a separate appropriations bill,  in a separate vehicle, so we could de bate  these  things  independently and  cut out  the waste. If we did it that  way, we would  save  the  taxpayers  money and still deal with most of these  problems.  ",1994
81,House,103,-0.386,1007,1,Mrs. MALONEY.," Madam Chairman, I  rise today in strong support of the so called Frank amendment to delete $1.2  billion in deficit spending for the Pen tagon. Once again, Congress seems in tent on fueling our constituents' anger  over totally unnecessary deficit spend ing.  The underlying bill was designed to  provide vital relief to  the victims of  the  tragic earthquake which  struck  California, but  this bill was not de signed  to  fund military  operations  which have been going on for up to 3  years. To include this spending makes  a mockery of the word ""emergency"",  and demeans the suffering of the quake  victims.  The Pentagon has $265 billion a year  to spend. It is about time they learned  to budget for ongoing operations.  If the Pentagon really needs another  $1.2 billion for its budget, at least we  should  follow normal  procedure  and  properly consider it in the appropria tions process this year. We should not  sneak it through as an emergency sup plemental.  The American people  support  true  compassionate emergency aid for  the  victims of disaster in California, but  they will not and should not support  this kind of hidden defense spending. I  urge adoption of the so-called Frank  amendment.  ",1994

I do not think it should be  funded in this way. However, if we do  not fund it, I feel that the military did  not ask to go to Somalia. It did not ask  to go to Haiti, but it has expenses. His torically, those expenses are passed on  to DOD.  We took a $50 billion cut in the 102d  Congress, with an additional $127 bil lion in this administration. The Presi dent says no more cuts. I am in three  different  committees,  and  in  every  committee they are still trying to cut  defense. Those  cuts  are  putting us  below a hollow force.  I  agree with  the gentleman  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.  FRANK]  that  it  should not be funded in this way. How ever, if we do not, the military, I know  this House, will not get it in the fu ture, and  the military will  take  the  heat.  ",1994

84,House,103,-0.191,1033,1,Mr. FINGERHUT.," Madam Chairman,  I  appreciate  the gentleman yielding  the time. The gentleman from Indiana,  my good friend, is right. This is a very  difficult vote and a  tough choice, but  the good news is that Members do not  need to have a  long-term memory to  understand what  is happening here.  They can act on their short-term mem ory, because this is the third time in  just three years that we have had mas sive emergencies that have required us  to break our commitments with  re spect to spending caps.  I was not happy when I went through  the list of cuts that are on this amend ment. Some of them made me smile be cause I agree with them. Some of them  made me flinch a little bit, and some of  them, frankly, made my stomach tight,  understanding  that they were on  the  list. But that is the essence of tough  choices. That is the essence of biparti sanship.  But I think my friend, the gentleman  from California  [Mr. CONDIT]  had  it  right at the beginning when he said  that  there are no good choices here  today. But the final choice is whether  we pay for this emergency ourselves, or  whether we pay for  it by asking our  children to do so.  I choose to pay for it ourselves.  ",1994
85,House,103,-0.372,1033,1,Mr. JOHNSTON of Florida.," Madam  Chairman, I  rise  in strong opposition  to the Penny-Kasich amendment. This  amendment would unfairly and dras tically cut U.S. development assistance  to Africa,  the poorest continent on  Earth. U.S. aid to Africa is already dis proportionately low compared to other  parts of the world. To cut assistance  further would be seriously detrimental  to all we seek to achieve, both politi cally and economically, in Africa.  The proposed $200 million cut in the  development fund for Africa, a 25-per cent cut, would  force  termination of  many  desperately  needed  programs  such as poverty reduction, child sur vival, basic education, and nutrition. I  emphasize to Members that this most  basic level of program is at issue. Do  we truly want to cut this type of as sistance  to  a  continent stricken by  famine, disease, and civil war?  To quote  from AID Administrator  Brian Atwood's testimony this morn ing, Penny-Kasich would be ""devastat ing for South Africa."" The South Afri can election, scheduled for late April,  will cap a remarkable transition from  apartheid to nonracial democracy. Yet  South Africa will need immediate as sistance to ensure that the enormous  transition  is  successful.  Does  this  House really want to endanger the fu ture of nonracial democracy in South  Africa?  The American people, even  in  this  anti-foreign-aid  atmosphere,  know  right from wrong. The American people  know morality from its opposite.  The right vote, the moral vote, is to  defeat Penny-Kasich.  I  implore Mem bers not to inflict yet more suffering  on Africa.  ",1994
86,House,103,0.519,1033,1,Mr. DOOLITTLE.," Madam Chairman,  as a Californian I support the need for  earthquake relief. But as an American,  I believe that we must provide this re lief by making offsetting cu ts, not by  piling on further debt onto the backs of  every man, woman, and child in Cali fornia and  in  the rest of the United  States.  D 1700  Our national debt is destroying our  children's future, and that threat is a  much bigger  threat  than any of  the  proposed cuts in the list offered by our  colleagues in the amendment before us.  This amendment starts us off in a new  direction by making offsetting cuts.  If we cannot sacrifice by cutting $10  billion in order to provide earthquake  relief, we do not deserve to be here. We  need to control our spending, Madam  Chairman. Let us begin here.  I urge approval of this amendment.  ",1994
87,House,103,-0.362,1033,1,Mr. DURBIN.," Madam Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  Madam  Chairman,  the  disasters  which we have witnessed in America in  the last 12 months have demonstrated  extraordinary acts of courage by Amer icans and extraordinary acts of politi cal perfidy by this House of Represent atives.  Today we are debating whether or  not we are going to make substantial  cuts in essential services in the Federal  Government so that the victims of the  California earthquake, who are looking  for shelter and food, will  receive our  assistance. Those who argue that they  are showing courage today by putting  the fate of these victims on the line, I  think, overstate the case. I think what  they are suggesting in terms of cuts, in  terms of essential services, are wrong,  dead wrong. To cut 581 employees from  the Food and Drugs Administration  means,  for  every American  family  within the sound of my voice, we will  not see drug approvals coming through  as  they should; approvals of medical  devices to help people who are suffer ing;  the  inspection of mammography  clinics, and inspection of those labora tories which are life and death in terms  of the future of America's health. That  is what we will sacrifice if the Penny Kasich amendment passes.  To do  that in  the name of helping  earthquake victims,  I  think,  is dead  wrong. It is morally wrong for us to  create this choice. The best choice is to  say that we are going to look at this  problem in a serious,  long-term fash ion,  to take the bipartisan task force  which  the Speaker has appointed  to  deal with disasters and come up with  honest solutions.  The  Penny-Kasich  approach  cuts  those agencies in the U.S. Department  of Agriculture which are  responsible  for helping today's flood victims. That  makes no sense whatsoever.  Please keep in mind that somewhere  in southern California in some shelter  there sits a homeless person watching  this debate wondering if this Congress  will ever finish all of this hot air in  time to deliver the kind of assistance  they need  to put their lives back in  order.

88,Senate,103,0.056,1059,1,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, I send  an amendment to the desk and ask for  its immediate consideration.  ",1994
89,Senate,103,0.196,1085,1,Mr. DANFORTH.,"  President,  there are some things that cannot be  done by people in the name of their re ligion on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  There are some  things that must be  done in one's own life and in one's own  community.  That realization that there are limits  to what Government can do and what  Government cannot do pertaining  to  religious activity is the rationale for  this Senator, or one of the rationale for  this Senator, leaving the Senate.  That is not  to say  that important  values cannot be stated on the floor of  the U.S. Senate and even furthered on  the floor of the U.S. Senate. But what  is done here in Washington can never  be confused with religious observance  or purely religious activity. At least, it  does not encompass the totality of reli gious activity.  So I would simply like to point out  that when we deal with religious mat ters in Government, when we deal with  religious matters in Congress, it is not  necessarily a question of: Well, who is  for  religion and who  is against reli gion? It is not a matter of let us go to  the Senate floor and vote on whether  or not we are going to be religious. Be cause,  in fact,  there  is not any reli gious position that I know of on this  legislation.  There are various denominations,  I  am sure,  that have various views on  the efficacy of school prayer and the  wisdom of having prayers  in public  schools.  But this is not a vote or an amend ment dealing with whether or not a  Senator or whether or not the country  itself is on God's side or not on God's  side. That does not have anything to do  with it.  Nor is this a constitutional issue that  is being raised today. The Senator from  North Carolina has not offered a con stitutional amendment. It is not pos sible to amend the Constitution of the  U.S. by an act of Congress. Whether or  not  there are constitutional prohibi tions on prayer in school, how the Su preme Court interprets those constitu tional limitations is in no way affected  by this amendment.  This  amendment  implies  that we  take  the Constitution as we  find  it,  that we  take Constitution as it has  It  been interpreted by the United States  Supreme Court. And,  taking it as we  find  it,  then we decide what  to do  about a particular amendment offered  on the floor of the Senate.  So this amendment does not open up  new  constitutional  possibilities  for  prayer in school. No,  it does not. It  does something else.  This amendment is what is known as  a mandate. This  is a mandate  from  Washington,  or a  proposed mandate  from Washington, directed from us to  the school districts of America.  Now,  there are  those who believe  that we should be uttering mandates  from Washington about everything and  anything  that goes on at  the  local  level. There are those who believe that  we  in Washington  know  how  local  school districts should conduct  their  affairs, and, knowing how local school  districts should conduct their affairs,  we then hand down our orders.  Here is the way we hand down our or ders from Washington. We say: Do you  want our money? School districts of  America, we have money in Washing ton,  seemingly unlimited money.  does not matter if we raised it in taxes  or not. If we do not have enough that  we taxed from the American people, we  borrow it. We have money. Would you  like it? Would you like to have Wash ington's money? Well,  if you want  Washington's money, do  things Wash ington's way. And that is exactly what  this amendment does. It is a mandate.  We in Congress, if we pass this, have  decided that our money, Washington's  money, will not be available  through  our Department,  the Department of  Education, under this act to State or  local school districts that deny or ef fectively prevent participation in pray er. That is our mandate.  My understanding of the debate here tofore on this bill that is now before  us, Education 2000, was that a  lot of  people did not believe in Government  mandates. A lot of people believe that  the  answers  should be  in  the  local  school districts or in the States, not in  the Congress of the United States; that  we should be very reluctant to condi tion the granting or the withholding of  Federal funds on people in the school  districts doing  things our way. That  was my understanding of  the debate  prior to this afternoon.  But now we are told; school prayer is  different. We believe in it. And, really,  we know the answers, and the decision  should no longer be made in the school  districts. We  in Washington  should  make the decision. If the school dis tricts want  our money,  then  they  should comply, like it or not; no discre tion. No discretion. No ability to make  a judgment on the basis of the particu lar needs or the judgment of the people  on the school boards of America. For get  them. What do  they know? Poor  dumb clucks out there. We know the  answers here  in Washington. So we  pass  a  mandate,  conditioning  the  granting or the withholding of Federal  funds on the school boards of America  doing things our way.  Let us suppose that there is a school  district out  there somewhere  that is  Northern  Ireland writ small. Let us  suppose  there  is a community some where in America where  there is ter rible dissension on the basis of religion.  Let us suppose that it is someplace,  say,  in  a  State where Mr.  Louis  Farrakhan's representative has been  making 21/2-hour  speeches castigating  Jews. Let us suppose that a school dis trict would say to itself: In this kind of  volatile atmosphere we really think it  would be better if our schools would  not be involved in the business of the  practice of religion.  We would say by this vote: We do not  care about what you think. We do not  care  about  the  conditions  in  your  school district. So what? What if there  is disruption? What  if people are at  swords points in your community over  religion? What if there have been all  kinds of incidents, swastikas painted  on buildings  in your school district?  What if Protestants are against Catho lics? What if there is a  true minority  religion and it feels put upon in that  community, and your school district  says: Let our school be an island of  peace. We do not care about that. Be cause if you want Federal money, you  better do things our way. The central  office has made  the decision on  this  matter, not you in the local school dis tricts.  I would point out, incidentally, that  this amendment may be a backdoor  way of preventing Federal funds going  to any school district because there are  cases where  the Supreme Court has  said that, under certain circumstances,  what  could be  denominated  as vol untary prayer is unconstitutional. If a  schoolteacher stands up and says, ""We  are going to have a voluntary prayer in  this school. You kids are free to join in  it or not to join in it."" It is my under standing that that is not permissible  under the Constitution, as interpreted  by the Supreme Court. This particular  amendment does not do anything about  the Constitution. But it does say that  in that case, if a school district takes  the position that it is going to comply  with the Constitution, then that com pliance with the Constitution is a limi tation on voluntary prayer,  thereby  cutting off Federal funds.  So I point out the fact that the way  this amendment is drafted it could be a  trap. It could be a  trap that says to  school  districts  that,  unless  your  schools operate in an unconstitutional  manner, the funds are no longer going  to be available.  I would also like to call the Senate's  attention-I am sorry the exact form of  the amendment, the wording, has been  covered up. It is a very, very interest ing last sentence which I will read to  the Senate.  ",1994

95,,103,-0.424,1202,1,Mr. JEFFERSON.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing the Coachbuilder's Exemption Act  of 1994,  legislation to redress an  inequity in  the Tax Code  relating  to  the so-called gas  guzzler  tax exemption  for small companies  who lengthen automobiles into limousines.  Under section 4064 of the code, a tax is im posed  if an automobile's  fuel economy per formance  falls below the Environmental Pro tection Agency's [EPA]  fuel economy ratings  for  that automobile's model  type. The  tax,  which is imposed upon the sale or initial lease  of the vehicle by a manufacturer, ranges from  $1,000 to $7,000.  The gas guzzler tax was enacted as part of  the Energy Tax Act of 1978 as a conservation  measure and to encourage greater automobile  fuel economy, a policy goal that I strongly sup port. However, this policy should not be pur sued without consideration  for  special  cir cumstances. In this regard, Congress has rec ognized that certain exceptions to the tax are  reasonable and necessary  to prevent unfair ness. For example, in 1986 Congress amend ed the gas guzzler tax to exempt small manu facturers,  generally manufacturers of  fewer  than 10,000 vehicles annually, who  lengthen  existing automobiles  into  limousines. Clearly,  imposition of the tax on such small producers  was  inappropriate and did not generally en hance energy conservation. Regrettably, and  with  little explanation,  the coachbuilder's ex emption was repealed with the enactment of  the luxury tax on automobiles in the Revenue  Reconciliation Act of 1990, although the Rec onciliation Act excluded  limousines operated  for commercial purposes from the new luxury  tax.  The repeal of the coachbuilder's exemption  in  1990 has had a devastating effect on  coachbuilders and operators. Jobs have been  lost and costs  to operators have  increased  dramatically. During 1988 and 1989, prior to  the repeal of the exemption,  there were ap proximately 35 coachbuilders who lengthened  8,000 to 9,000 cars annually. Today, only 12  coachbuilders remain and less than 1 ,400 ve hicles annually are lengthened. These vehicles  tax of $2,000 per auto bear an average  mobile-the economic burden of which  is di rectly borne by the operator. By and large, the  limousine industry is comprised of small busi nesses. The typical operator owns 5 vehicles  and must replace one vehicle about every 18  to 24 months.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation I am introducing  would reinstate the coachbuilder's exemption,  and, thereby, eliminate a significant economic  burden on  industry and on  limousine opera tors. Reinstatement would have a negligible  revenue  impact,  increase  jobs, and  redress  the inequity of imposing a tax that has essen tially crippled these small businesses.  The  gas  guzzler  as  it  applies  to  coachbuilders and  limousine operators does  little, if anything, to  further overall fuel econ omy. Essentially, the tax is a penalty on wed dings, school proms, business gatherings, and  other occasions  requiring  special  transpor tation services.  In addition,  tax  is especially  burdensome  for operators  located  in  tourist  centers like my city of New Orleans where lim ousine services are  required  for vacationers  and conventioneers.  The parallels between  this matter and the  automobile luxury tax are striking. In that case,  as with the coachbuilders' and the gas guzzler  tax, business owners and workers are the vic tims rather than the consumers of the service  or product. It is time to fix this problem just as  we did so just last year with the repeal of the  automobile luxury tax.  I urge my colleagues to join me in redress ing this situation by cosponsoring this bill.  tax,  School  in my hometown of Memphis, TN,  proudly observed  its 50th anniversary, and  I  wanted to take a moment to share that mile stone with my colleagues and to urge them to  join me in offering the congratulations of this  body.  In November 1944 Whitehaven became a  mission of St. Thomas Parish in south Mem phis-10 acres of  land were purchased on  Shelby Drive and the Catholic families of the  area were organized. Special permission was  granted for Mass to be celebrated in the Gillia  Home. Father Angelo Lenzi was named  the  first pastor in March 1945, and began an enor mous building program. A crypt and then an  upper church were completed over the next  few years and served as the place of worship.  Construction began on  the school  in 1949  while students met daily in the crypt. Over the  next 15 years the school expanded to some  22 classrooms and a beautiful gymnasium.  This adequately met  the growing enrollment  that reached into the 800 range.  While the school and student body grew, so  too did  the Whitehaven and Catholic popu lation. The need for a new church was a long time dream  that began  to be  realized when  ground was broken  in  1961. The present  beautiful church, seating over 1, 100 people,  was dedicated on November 20, 1964. The  pastors of St. Paul have been: Father Angelo  Lenzi, 1945-53; Father Edward Cleary, 195468; Father Walter Bush, 1968-70; Monsignor  Theron Walker,  1970-81;  Father  Leonard  Oglesby,  1981-87; Father  John McArthur,  1987-present.  St. Paul has been a stable, ongoing Catho lic presence in Memphis and Whitehaven for  50 years, growing and expanding with  the  community. Nurtured by the commitment and  energy of the Catholic community in Memphis,  St. Paul has built and sustained a school of  exemplary academic reputation. I am proud to  join in saluting its first 50 years and in looking  forward to the continuation of its proud tradi tion.  HAPPY 90TH BIRTHDAY, CELY  MIGUEL  HON.

98,,103,0.336,1215,1,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  pleased to introduce, along with SUSAN MOL INARI and other colleagues, the Head Start En-.  hanced Parental  Involvement and Family Lit eracy Act of 1994.  This bill  is a continuation of our efforts to  improve  the quality of Head Start services,  which recently have been shown to be lacking  in many ways. When it comes to Heart Start,  I have always been a firm believer in the cli che: Quality over quantity. And I think that this  legislation which we are introducing today will  go a long ways toward improving the quality of  the program, which has suffered as a result of  the push to continually increase the numbers  of children served.  I am confident that this bill will improve qua~  ity, because it is directed at the resource that  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  is limitless with regard to furthering a child's  education, and which will continue on once the  child has left Head Start.  I am talking about  parents.  I know the parental involvement component  of Head Start is one of the pillars upon which  the program was  founded, and  that parents  that take advantage of it are positively affected  by it. But we must do more, because for every  parent that does get involved there is one who  doesn't. And so,  this bill will  require Head  Start programs to take measures to increase  the level of parental involvement so that Head  Start will become a truly intergenerational pro gram.  Mr. Speaker, I originally wanted to place the  requirement to get involved upon the individual  parent, instead of on the program.  I still feel  that this is the way to go, because it is time  that we make these parents, who receive the  benefit of enrolling their children in Head Start,  step-up and take responsibility for rearing and  educating their children.  This is, however, a reauthorization year for  Head Start, and we are currently negotiating  with the administration on the possibility of a  bipartisan reauthorization bill and we want to  make sure that some provisions regarding en hancing parental involvement are  included in  that reauthorization bill. Requiring programs to  seek parental  involvement  is  the common  ground upon which everyone can agree, and  so we have incorporated that concept into this  bill. I want to make it clear, however, that I, or  perhaps one of my colleagues, may attempt to  amend the reauthorization package at a later  stage to shift the requirement to the parents.  Beyond  enhancing  parental  involvement,  this bill also injects the notion of family literacy  into the Head Start statute for the first time. As  the primary congressional supporter of Even  Start, the Federal family literacy program, I am  convinced that this type of service would fur ther  improve  the quality of Head Start pro grams.  Family literacy is an approach to breaking  the pattern of undereducation and poverty in  the nation that is passed on within the families  from one generation to the next. It integrates  adult  literacy  instruction and early childhood  education to address the needs of the entire  family, rather than isolated individuals within it.  Family  literacy is based on the premise that  parents and children can  learn  together and  enhance each other's  lives.  It  restores  the  family as the center for learning.  When parents and children  learn together,  an attitude of appreciation and  respect  for  education are modeled  for  the children  that  paves  the way  for school success. At  the  same time, parents acquire new skills for work  and home and a new appreciation of their role  as the first teacher of their children. The family  is strengthened by supporting the parents as  the first and most important teachers of their  children, and by developing positive and sup portive attitudes about schooling, the work and  joy of learning, and the connection between  education and the quality of life.  1193T  One other aspect of this bill that I want to  mention is that,  in addition to family  literacy,  Head Start programs would be  required  to  provide parenting skills training and other ac tivities designed to help parents become full  partners in the education of their children. Par enting skills  training goes hand-in-hand with  the concept of enhanced parental involvement.  All parents must cope with the stress of every day  life, and often  that stress  is greater for  low-income parents. Parenting skills  training  would help these parents look past other prot:r  lems and concentrate on effective techniques  for interacting with their children.  Mr. Speaker,  in closing,  I want to express  my appreciation  to Representative MOLINARI  for working with me on this important piece of  legislation, and  to Representatives BARRElT,  FAWELL, CASTLE, and MILLER for being original  cosponsors.

99,,103,-0.362,1215,1,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, my  first  job  in  Government was on the staff of Senator Paul  H. Douglas of Illinois. This legendary legislator  served the people of Illinois and left a grand  legacy to our Nation. Those of us who were  fortunate to have known and worked for Sen ator Douglas come to realize that his strength  was enhanced by his wife, Emily Taft Douglas.  Mrs. Douglas was an extraordinary public  servant in her own right. She identified closely  with  the problems faced by common people  and she was at home in every corner of our  diverse State.  I am sorry to report to the House that Emily  Taft Douglas passed away last week. It is fit ting  that we-pause and reflect on the great  personal contribution which she made to this  House of Representatives and our Nation.  Elected Congresswoman-at-Large  in 1944,  Mrs. Douglas was the first woman to precede  a husband  in Congress. She served on the  Foreign Affairs Committee and was an active  proponent of post-war United Nations Relief  and Rehabilitation Agency programs. She  in troduced legislation for library bookmobiles for  rural areas, which was ultimately passed as  the Hill-Douglas bill  following her husband's  election to the U.S. Senate in 1948.  Prior  to  her election  to Congress, Mrs.  Douglas was active in the fight against inter national fascism and was a strong opponent of  American  isolationism. She served as  Illinois  Secretary  for the League of Women Voters,  chaired  the League's  foreign policy depart ment, and later was executive secretary of the  International Relations Center in Chicago.  Mrs. Douglas also enjoyed a part-time ca reer as an author. She wrote  ""Appleseed  ",1994

Many of us have witnessed  mentoring programs in the schools. I  mentioned earlier in the debate how  teachers in Dade County are mentoring  young students to interest them in pur suing careers  in  teaching. They are  making a very powerful impact. They  have been able  to gain many of the  most gifted students in their classes,  who  continue  their  educations  and  then return to teach in their commu nities.  We have seen a variety of different  mentoring programs for individual stu dents conducted by  the  schools,  the  communities, and by the private sector  as well. The cost  incurred  is a very  small expense for what has been dem onstrated as a very effective program.  I welcome  these  recommendations,  and the opportunity to support effec tive mentoring programs.  I thank the Senator very much.  ",1994

SHELBY,  CHAFEE,  GLENN,  DANFORTH,  HATFIELD,  STEVENS,  PRYOR,  KOHI..,  INOUYE,  DOMENIC!,  BINGAMAN,  HOL LINGS, DECONCINI, COCHRAN' and myself  and ask  for  its  immediate consider ation.  Mr. President, the bill we are debat ing today deals extensively with ways  to reform our Nation's struggling edu cation system. Over the past 20 years,  we have seen SAT scores decline by 35  points,  even  though  the amount of  money spent per pupil on primary and  secondary  school  students  has  in creased 47 percent. After 1983, when the  Carnegie Foundation published ""A Na tion At Risk,"" States and the Congress  were spurred to implement a number of  major  reforms,  including  reducing  class sizes, increasing teacher pay and  professional  development  opportuni ties,  placing  increased  emphasis  on  math and science, and the like.  Despite 10 years of reform, our edu cation system still struggles. Our kids  rank next to last in the world among  industrialized nations on proficiency in  science. Only Spain, Slovenia, and Jor dan score lower in math than United  States students. Our kids  take fewer  foreign languages, and test scores have  shown little or modest  improvement.  These trends are particularly disturb ing as we enter a period of global com petition.  Why is this happening? I believe we  must look further than the schools and  teachers when we  talk about reasons  for our decline as an ""education super power."" It is no secret that family dis integration and decline has contributed  greatly to many of the problems in the  system. Schools are now expected, in deed required, to take on many of the  functions which were traditionally the  responsibilities of the family. Many of  our public  schools now offer health  classes,  mental  health  counseling,  school breakfast and lunch, and after school programs.  It is theoretically possible for a child  to go  through the entire day without  seeing either parent. About two-thirds  of mothers of children  from 6  to 18  work outside  the home, whether by  choice or because of financial neces sity. The divorce rate has skyrocketed  since 1970, and 20 percent of all kids  now live with only one parent. The re sult is that our kids are poorer in ma terial  terms, and worse,  that parents  their children's  are  less  involved  in  lives than ever before.  Recent studies have shown that par ents spend only a few minutes each day  in direct interaction with their chil dren. I do not believe our children are  better off as a  result of these social  trends;  in fact  I believe  they  suffer  greatly.  No one can argue that our teen sui cide rate is up, and our teenage preg nancy rate is unacceptable. Nearly half  of school-age kids-44 percent-are left  unsupervised after school. Those kids  are more likely to do drugs, to engage  in premarital sex, and to do poorly in  sch001. The generation of kids  cur rently  in our Nation's public schools  have less time with their parents than  ever before-less time to share meals,  less time to do homework, less time to  learn from their parents what is and is  not appropriate behavior. 'rhe results  of  this neglect show up  in  truancy,  poor  test scores,  teenage pregnancy,  drug and alcohol abuse, and a host of  other social problems.  Despite this accelerated pace of so cial change over the years, children's  needs today are the same as they were  in 1970. All children need at least one  loving parent to provide for their mate rial needs and  to help develop  their  abilities, personalities, and characters.  These needs do not begin at age 6, 10 or  16, but at birth. A child cannot put his  needs on hold until his parent is ready  and willing to meet them. In fact the  first years are the most important.  As Reverend Halverson has pointed  out, a child learns half of all he will  ever know by the time he reaches age  3. Within the first 3 years of life, the  foundations of personality, character,  and learning are laid through the ex ample and effort of a child's parents.  Yet  today's American  parent  faces  pressures that were unheard of a gen eration ago. Young mothers have en tered the work force, both by choice  and economic necessity, in record num bers over the last two decades. Parents  often have jobs that force the family to  relocate to cities away from extended  family members. The  result  is  that  children spend less time with their par ents than ever before; in addition, they  are  often  away  from  grandmothers,  aunts, and other members of their fam ily who can provide the support that is  necessary through good times and bad.  Mr. President, I believe that parent  education and early childhood develop ment programs can help parents coun teract the disturbing trend of not hav ing enough time  to spend with their  children and the problem of extended  family  separation. Missouri,  Illinois,  Kansas, and many other States have  begun  to offer parent education pro grams in order to help parents be their  children's first and very best teachers.  The Parents as Teachers Program,  development in my home State of Mis souri, provides new parents with information about all stages of a child's de velopment and advice about how  to  deal with  the challenges  that come  with having children: Teething, night mares, temper tantrums, illnesses, and  more. Health screening is also provided  on a periodic basis for each child so  that health problems do not go unde tected and untreated.  Parents as teachers and similar pro grams  emphasize  the  importance  of  parents  in developing  the emotional,  physical, and social elements of their  children's personalities in addition to  providing for their material needs. Par ents as  teachers helps parents make  the most of the time they spend with  their children and provides construc tive advice about how to beat the time  crunch.  Missouri  has  found  great  success  through parents as teachers; children  enter school ready to learn and their  parents are involved in the schools and  in their children's education.  Mr. President, I do not believe we  will ever be able to reform education  until we really involve those with the  primary  responsibility:  parents. Re search  shows  that parental  involve ment in the education of their children  is  the  key  to  long-term gains  for  youngsters.  Parents  are  their  chil dren's first and most influential teach ers. What parents do to help their chil dren learn is more important to aca demic success than other factors. We  need to help ensure strong links be tween the home and school from  the  earliest possible time.  At the request of Senator HATFIELD,  the committee has added a seventh na tional goal:  that of parental involve ment. I commend the Senator from Or egon for his strong voice on behalf of  parents. Frankly, the idea of parental  involvement is so simple, so basic, so  fundamental to true progress that I am  surprised it took this long  to be  in cluded in the national goals.  Now, for that goal to be truly mean ingful, we should put some  teeth be hind it.  The parents-as-teachers curriculum  starts early in strengthening the foun dations of later learning-language and  intellectual development, curiosity and  social  skills.  In  addition,  health  screening is provided for participating  preschool children to detect potential  impairments early.  Parents as teachers is a proven, effec tive  program.  Two  independent  re search studies have shown that chil dren participating in parents as teach ers  consistently  score  significantly  higher on all measures of intellectual  achievement, auditory comprehension,  verbal  ability,  and  language  ability  than their peers who did not partici pate. And these gains held true regard less of the socioeconomic status of the  family, or marital status of the par ents.  Parents-as-teachers staff have been  successful in identifying and interven",1994

106,Senate,103,-0.301,49,7,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Madam President,  last week we witnessed an exhilarating  event for  those of us who have  long  hoped for change in South Africa. The  fruits of years of struggle for an end to  apartheid in South Africa have ripened  as  the country held  its  first multi racial election.  The votes of those oppressed by dec ades of racial segregation will propel  South Africa into a new era of political  participation  and  racial  equality.  Those who have  tried  to scuttle  the  elections  through political manipula tion, threats and violence have failed.  The enthusiasm of the people of South  Africa,  the majority of whom have  waited their whole lives for this oppor tunity, is unparalleled.  Only a  few years ago the possibility  of holding these elections was remote.  It  is a  testament  to  the bravery of  those oppressed by apartheid and  to  the indomitable desire for freedom that  after this  long and difficult struggle  those  seeking  fundamental  liberties  have prevailed. Despite  rising  inter national pressure and growing popular  unrest,  the government clung  to  the  fetters of apartheid.  As early as 1975 the apartheid govern ment felt  the effects of international  scrutiny, when  the United Nations  General Assembly adopted a resolution  entitled  ""Solidarity With  the South  African Political Prisoners."" I had the  honor  of  representing  the  United  States as  the Permanent Representa tive to  the United Nations when this  matter came before the Assembly. The  United States delegation presented a  very strong  lawyer-like case against  apartheid by documenting specific po litical  prisoners,  including  Nelson  Mandela,  held  in South Africa  and  thereby refuting their United Nations  Representative's claim that not one in dividual was held in South Africa be cause of their opposition to apartheid.  Nelson Mandala's crime for which he  served 27 years in prison, was to advo cate equality and democratic reforms.  He was  finally  released 9 days after  President F.W. de Klerk delivered his  February 2, 1990 speech in which he an nounced that political prisoners would  be released, the ban on political groups  such as the African National Congress  would be lifted and the intention of the  government to actively seek a peaceful  deconstruction of apartheid. Upon this  release, Mr. Mandela repeated a state ment he made during his 1964 trail, in  which he stated:  I have  fought against white domination,  and I have fought against black domination.  I have cherished the idea of a democratic and  free  society  in which all persons  live  to gether in harmony and with equal opportuni ties. It is an ideal which I hope to live for  and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an idea  for which I am prepared to die.  Since then he has worked to fulfill  his noble aspiration.  The United States and others con tinue to support democratic change in  appropriate ways. A year later, when  the Bush administration proposed lift ing economic sanctions against South  Africa,  I  stated  for  the  record  that  while de Klerk reforms were a praise worthy development  in South Africa,  more was needed:  The reality of apartl:).eid remains and we  must not permit the South African Govern ment  to believe  that it has done enough,  that the international community is satis fied. The truth is very different. The South  African Government has only just begun to  correct  the  injustice of apartheid and  the  United States Congress will be monitoring  its continued progress closely.  And we will  still  be monitoring  events  in South Africa closely  to be  sure  the elections were  fair and  the  transfer of power is smooth and accord ing to schedule. As the vestiges of the  legally-enforced  racist  policies  of  apartheid are stripped away,  those in  South Africa who have dedicated their  lives  to achieving  this  triumph will  hear the applause as they join the fam ily of nations committed  to democ racy, universal suffrage and the rule of  law. I congratulate the people of South  Africa  on  this momentous  achieve ment.  1994,  1993  SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS  ",1994

108,Senate,103,-0.351,166,7,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation, along with  Senator LUGAR,  that will clarify con gressional intent regarding the regula tion of animal fats and vegetable oils  under provisions of the Oil Pollution  Act of 1990, which amended the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act.  The  interpretation of  these  provi sions is of critical importance to agri culture and to the en tire food process ing,  transportation,  and distribution  system. This legislation is necessary to  ensure against burdensome and unnec essary regulatory actions by Federal  agencies based on interpreting the Oil  Pollution Act  to  impose on nontoxic  and  relatively harmless animal  fats  and vegetable oils rules similar to the  stringent  requirements applicable  to  toxic and hazardous petroleum oils and  products.  Congress enacted  the Oil Pollution  Act of 1990 in direct response to several  catastrophic  petroleum  oilspills  in  order to reduce the risk of oilspills, im prove oilspill response capabilities, and  minimize the impact of oilspills on the  environment. That act requires owners  and operators of vessels and facilities  handling oil posing a substantial risk  of harm  to  the environment  in  the  event of a spill to prepare and submit  response plans to Federal agencies and  establishes additional requirements re lating  to  the handling and  transpor tation of oil.  Common sense tells us that the risk  posed  to  the environment by animal  fats and vegetable oils-which are es sential components of food products we  eat every day-is far  less  than  that  posed by petroleum oil and products.  The available scientific evidence shows  that animal fats and vegetable oils are  not toxic to the environment, are es sential components of human and wild life diets, are  readily biodegradable,  and are not persistent in the environ ment.  Spills of animal fats and vegetable  oils are also relatively infrequent and  small  in  quantity.  Such  spills  ac counted for less than 1 percent of oil spills  in and around U.S. waters be tween 1986 and 1992, and were generally  very small in quantity, with only 13  spills of more than 1,000 gallons in that  period.  Moreover,  the types of response ac tions appropriate  to a petroleum oil spill might well increase, rather than  lessen, the impact of an animal fat or  vegetable oilspill on the environment.  For example, attempting to remove a  typically small quantity of spilled animal fat or vegetable oil from a wetland  would likely cause more environmental  damage than the presence of the spilled  substance in the environment alone.  Nevertheless,  last year  the Depart ment of Transportation's Research and  Special Projects Agency sought to clas sify animal fats and vegetable oils as  hazardous materials in the same man ner as petroleum oils. That approach  was abandoned only after the affected  industries mounted a strong effort and  after Members of Congress,  including  Senator LUGAR and me, wrote  to the  agency emphasizing that it was never  the intent of Congress to subject ani mal fats and vegetable oils to the same  regulations as apply to hazardous ma terials.  Despite  this action  in  the Depart ment of Transportation, there are still  pending before several Federal agencies  regulations under the Oil Pollution Act  that would treat nontoxic, biodegrad able oils, such as corn and soybean oils,  beef tallow, and fish oil similarly  to  highly  toxic petroleum oils. If these  agencies proceed with regulations im posing requirements on animal fats and  vegetable oils similar to those covering  petroleum oils, processors,  transport ers, and users of animal fats and vege table oils will be forced to comply with  costly, burdensome, unnecessary-and  indeed  often  counterproductive--re quirements that are appropriate only  for  toxic  oils. Ultimately,  farmers,  livestock  producers,  and  consumers  will bear the cost of such overregula tion.  Even if all of the agencies are eventu ally persuaded not  to  finalize  these  pending regulations, a large amount of  effort and resources are likely to be ex pended  in successive and duplicative  appeals  to reason and common sense  before each of the several agencies in volved.  The  legislation we are  introducing  today would reduce  the potential for  burdensome  and  unnecessary  regu latory  actions by  directing Federal  agencies to differentiate between ani mal fats, oils and greases, fish and ma rine mammal oils, or oils of vegetable  origin, and other oils and greases, in cluding petroleum.  In differentiating  between these classes, agencies would  be required to consider differences in  the physical, chemical, biological, and  other properties, and in  the environ mental effects, of the classes.  The  legislation would not  exempt  animal fats, vegetable oils, or fish oils  from  appropriate  oilspill  prevention  and  response  regulations.  It would  merely require  that agencies develop  any such regulations on  the basis of  the particular physical, chemical, bio logical, and other properties of these  substances and their effects on the en vironment. Again, the problem here is  the  threat  of  sweeping,  undis criminating agency actions that would  carelessly  impose  unnecessary  regulatory burdens by treating all of these  substances in a manner similar to pe troleum. This legislation would simply  require agencies to undertake a reason able, commonsense analysis before reg ulating. That is certainly no more than  we should expect of any agency.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation. I also ask unani mous consent that the text of the bill  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 2065  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION  1.

In the spring of 1993,  the Transpor tation Department  proposed  regula tions to guard against oilspills, andre quire response plans if spills did occur.  To the amazement of some of us, DOT  proposed to treat vegetable oils-that  is, salad oils-in the same way as pe troleum.

This was so classic an example of reg ulatory overreaching  that  it was al most comic.

110,House,103,-0.236,231,7,Mr. BACCHUS.," This is  a national flood insurance reform proposal that  will benefit both the Flood Insurance Program  and the Policyholders.  H.R. 3191 will assure that those who pur chase properties in special flood hazard areas  carry flood insurance in order to obtain a loan  from a federally backed lender. While the law  does require this now, the current enforcement  provisions are not strong enough  to ensure  that once a mortgage holder purchases insur ance, that person maintains the insurance as  long as he or she owns the property. The re sult is that only some 15-20 percent of those  who  should  carry  flood  insurance  aCtually  have it in force.  H.R. 3191 will provide  lending  institutions  the authority to purchase and maintain  flood  insurance  for  those whose properties are  in  special flood hazard areas and are required to  carry  insurance under  the  law. Furthermore,  the bill requires that lenders who are providing  loans  for properties  in special  flood hazard  areas inform borrowers of their requirement to  carry flood insurance in advance of a closing.  Clearly,  H.R.  3191  will  do more  than  strengthen enforcement of existing  law. The  act will help strengthen the stability of the Na tional Flood Insurance Program by giving com munities  incentives and  funding  to  reduce  risks. For example, the bill establishes a com munity rating system that will provide premium  credits  for  communities  that  pursue  rec ommendations to eliminate flood-prone condi tions.  H.R. 3191 will also help communities and  individuals to reduce flood risks by establish ing a grant program to aid in mitigation plan ning and to help cover the costs of mitigation.  Some of the activities eligible for grants under  this program include floodproofing of individual  structures, beach nourishment, construction of  sea walls and levees, and the puplic purchase  of properties to create buffer zones.  The bills that both Congressman BACCHUS  and I introduced contained provisions for miti gation  insurance  to help defray the costs of  bringing older, flood prone structures into com pliance with FEMA guidelines-a procedure  that would, in the long run, save money for the  flood insurance fund. However, chairman KEN NEDY had legitimate cost concerns about such  a program and opted not to  include it in  the  compromise  legislation.  To  his  credit,  he  worked with Mr. BACCHUS and me to tailor the  grant program  toward  individuals as well as  communities.  I certainly appreciate the chair man's efforts, but  I would still ask  that  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts and  others  who will  be  conferees  on  this  legislation,  strongly consider the merits of the mitigation  insurance program that is included in the Sen ate version of this legislation. I believe that, in  the end, Mitigation  Insurance will be the best  way to ensure that the structures that cost the  fund the most money are floodproofed.  And let me just take a second to talk about  these structures, which are known as  repet itive loss structures. These are properties that  have suffered at least two loses of 25 percent  or more over a 1 0 year period. These struc tures represent the largest drain on the flood  insurance fund, accounting  for some 40 per cent of claims. Almost all of these repetitive  loss structures are subsidized buildings not  designed  to FEMA's post-197 4 construction  standards which  require elevation to the 1 00  year flood level and other floodproofing meas ures.  I know that Chairman KENNEDY is interested  in  removing  subsidies  for  these and other  structures over a period of time--and I share  that view. One of  the most  frequently heard  criticisms about the flood insurance program is  that  it provides subsidies  to  landowners  in  risky areas.  As many of my colleagues know, under the  law,  the Director  is given  the authority  to  charge  less  than actuarial  rates on certain  structures  in order  to make  flood  insurance  available and affordable.  I agree  in part with  this philosophy because it is important that we  have broad participation in the program. How ever, it is time we begin to move toward actu arial rates.  I do not believe it was Congress'  intent to provide that subsidy in perpetuity.  I believe that we must make a serious effort  to move the Flood  Insurance Program away  from subsidies and do it is such a way so as  not to strain policyholders.  In my bill was a  provision which would require that in order to  offer policies at less than actuarial rates, the  Director must certify to the President and Con gress, on a biannual basis, that such rates are  necessary  in order to make  insurance avail able where necessary at reasonable rates so  as  to encourage participation  in  the National  Flood  Insurance Program. This would have  forced FEMA, Congress and  the administra tion to reassess the need for subsidies every  2 years and changed the basic emphasis of  the program.  I know  that  the chairman has been  inter ested  in pursuing  such a measured move  away  from subsidies, and commend him  for  his forward thinking. I am also appreciative of  his interest in my ideas on this matter, and al though we were not able  to  include such a  provision in this particular bill,  I hope that we  can work together to begin to take balanced  and realistic steps toward a more risk-based  flood insurance system.  Again, I would like to thank and compliment  Chairman KENNEDY and Mr. BACCHUS for their  work, as well as Mr. MCCANDLESS and Mr. BE REUTER who-as  I have  said  before--has  worked hard over several years on this issue.  This bill  is a good  first step  toward a more  sound flood insurance program. I urge my col leagues to support the measure.  ",1994
111,House,103,0.3,231,7,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Speaker,  I believe  the  House  is making a serious mistake  today  in  considering a matter as important as reform of  the Federal Flood  Insurance Program on the  Suspension Calendar.  I object to  the use of  this expedited process, and I urge Members to  defeat this flawed legislation.  I recognize and appreciate that the present  legislation is a vast improvement over earlier  versions, especially with  regard  to  the elimi nation of erosion zone mapping. In fact, FEMA  estimated that had erosion zone mapping be come a  reality, property owners  in erosion  zones could have seen  their premiums  rise  anywhere from $1 , 1 00 per year for a condo to  as much as $18,000 per year for a $250,000  single  family home. That would have abso lutely devastated communities in my district. I  am  gratified  that  voices  from  Florida and  coastal areas around the country were heard  and erosion zone mapping was removed from  this legislation.  Still, consideration under suspension of the  roles prohibits Members from offering amend ments to other controversial provisions that re main in this bill. I believe a number merit sep arate consideration and amendment. Just one  example  is how  this bill would modify  the  Flood  Insurance Program by adding the pur pose of encouraging State and  local govern ments to protect natural and beneficial flood plain  functions  that  reduce  flood-related  losses. This may sound harmless. However,  listing this additional purpose is an open invi tation for lawsuits blocking needed projects as  simple as a seawall. Similarly innocuous pur poses  in HUD  legislation have encouraged  groups  to sue, which supports  the  fact  that  H.R. 3191 will open the door to further mass  litigation.  I frankly doubt that more than a handful of  Members have reviewed or even seen the leg islation that is before us for a vote, which was  rushed  to  the  floor after an agreement was  reached only  last week. Many Members will  recall that the House approved similar flood in surance reform legislation in the previous Con gress. After cries of outrage were heard from  real Americans who understood what was at  stake,  the Senate succeeded  in  effectively  blocking passage of that legislation. I fear the  same fate may befall this bill unless changes  are made.  Real reform of the Flood Insurance Program  is needed, and I commend the Members who  have already made improvements to this bill.  The remaining problems, however, make it too  controversial for consideration on the Suspen sion Calendar.  I encourage Members to vote  against this bill, so that the Rules Committee  can send  it back to the floor with the oppor tunity for amendments that will make it a true  reform bill that all Members can support.  ",1994
112,House,103,0.351,231,7,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I urge my col leagues to vote for this compromise version of  H.R. 3191, the National Flood  Insurance Re form Act of 1994.  This bill is important to all States, especially  the Great Lakes States, with significant coast al and riverline development.  I am glad to see common sense has pre vailed after all in providing this alternative.  ",1994
113,,103,0.391,270,7,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay tribute to Buckley Peterson, who works  at the Veterans Administration in Des Moines,  lA, and provides stellar service to our Nation's  veterans. Mr. Peterson's record of service has  been brought to my attention by Stephen Nicol  of McCallsburg, lA.  Mr. Peterson had helped Mr. Nicol to enroll  in  Iowa State University's electrical engineer ing program through the VA Vocational Reha bilitation Program. Mr. Nicol,  in  numerous  dealings with Mr. Peterson, has had every  question, problem, or need addressed by Mr.  Peterson in a timely and satisfactory manner.  Mr. Nicol refers to Mr. Peterson as ""a pro fessional with a solid interest in both the suc cess of the program as well as the people in volved."" Mr. Nicol also states,  ""My medical  problems have been addressed with under standing and a knowledge of their impact on  my ability to study, emphasizing Buckley's de sire to be more than just a paper-pushing bu reaucrat, but rather a professional with a solid  interest in both the success of the program as  well as the people involved.""  Mr. Peterson's assistance to Mr. Nicol went  beyond his professional duties. While the Nicol  family was away on vacation, massive flooding  threatened their home and their property. Mr.  Peterson, knowing the Nicol family was away  from home and unable to take the necessary  steps  to protect  their home and belongings,  drove to the Nicol home on his own time and  organized  their neighbors  for cleanup oper ations.  In addition, he offered  to store  the  Nicol possessions in his garage until the wa ters receded.  That is,  in my view, service above and be yond the call of duty. Buckley Peterson  is to  be commended for his dedication.  May 3, 1994  THE ADMINISTRATION'S  PESTICIDE REFORM PROPOSAL  HON. CHARLFS W. STENHOLM  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 1994  ",1994
114,,103,0.019,270,7,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I join  Chairman DE LA GARZA  in  introducing, by re quest,  the administration's pesticide  reform  proposal. In my continuing effort to move this  process forward,  I am extremely interested in  laying this proposal next to others currently on  the  table so  that  it might receive  full  review  and consideration.  I am introducing this legis lation, not because  I necessarily support the  substance of the proposal, but because I sup port  the process of moving  this  important  issue forward.  Although I recognize the complexity of these  issues and appreciate  the efforts of  the  re spective agencies  to produce a comprehen sive package,  I am discouraged that we are  only now receiving  this legislation--7 months  after my subcommittee held hearings to review  the  administration's  intentions. We  should  have been moving forward many months ago,  not in the later stages of the 1 03d Congress.  Today's agriculture community is extremely  sensitive to the environmental and consumer  impact of bringing food and fiber to the rest of  the Nation. The farmer knows that he or she  is  successful  only  to  the  extent  that  the  consumer is satisfied. Our task, however, is to  ensure  that  these decisions are based on  sound, practical science; not temporary emo tional appeal.  Although we are blessed with, and often  taken advantage of a tremendous and whole some  food supply,  today's society demands  and deserves an updated legal framework by  which  to regulate that food supply. From  im proving efficiencies  in  the regulatory process  to assuring consumers that there is no signifi cant risk associated with our Nation's food and  fiber, improvements can and should be made.  I am anxious to move swiftly-to begin re viewing  the details of  this proposal and  to  work cooperatively with other committees of  jurisdiction, the full Agriculture Committee, and  this administration  in bringing a measure of  this nature to the floor of the House as soon  as possible.

In fact,  the overpayment rate, for ex ample, has gone to just about 4.96 per cent, which is down 17 percent from  just 1991.  All of .us believe  in better enforce ment.

TRIBUTE TO JOYCE LYNN WILSON  HON. ROBERTK. DORNAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 4, 1994  ",1994
123,,103,0.49,439,7,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to take  this opportunity to pay tribute to Joyce Lynn  9319  Wilson. To the shock and disbelief of her fam ily,  friends, and  loved ones, on January 17,  1994, Joyce fell victim to the tragic earthquake  that  rocked  through southern California and  ripped apart  the  lives of so many  innocent  people.  My wife Sallie, and  I, had known Joyce for  years. She stood by our side and the side of  her fellow Republicans and helped us fight the  evils  that  threatened our  families, our  liveli hood, and our country. She was not only a  wonderful woman, she was a loving wife and  mother, a devout Catholic, and a true patriot.  Those of us who were  fortunate enough  to  know Joyce continue  to be profoundly sad dened by her loss.  In memory of Joyce,  I would  like to  insert  the text of the eulogy that was given on  the  day of her  funeral. May she  rest  in eternal  peace in the arms of our Almighty Father.  ODE TO JOY, A EULOGY FOR JOYCE LYNN  WILSON, JUNE 15, 1941-JANUARY 17, 1994  On  the morning of January 17,  the earth  trembled, and Joyce Lynn Wilson died. I'd  like to say that another way. On the morn ing of January 17, Joyce Lynn Wilson died,  and the earth trembled. Her heart trembled,  and gave its last beat as she summoned her  children  to safety. Hers was a big heart warm, generous, and  full of Joy. Her life,  like all of ours, was filled with many sor rows,  trials and tragedies, but her attitude  was like her name-joy.  She always called Gayle her baby sister,  and me her baby brother-in-law. So now I  would like to talk about my big sister-in law.  Joy was a writer, a devout and staunch  Catholic, a pro-lifer and a patriot, not  to  mention a wife, mother, aunt, grandmother,  beautician,  teacher,  taxi  service, political  activist, confidant, and friend.  As a wife and mother, she brought seven  lovely  children  into  this world:  Shelley,  Kathleen, Monica, Eddie, Mike, Elizabeth,  and Eileen.  She  sewed,  shopped,  cooked,  mended, and even found time to make those  lovely holiday crafts which so many of us  have in our homes. She worked tirelessly for  her kids schooling. How many hours did she  spend on her knees scrubbing the bathroom  floors at Padre Pio Academy? She was de voted to the end.  With seven children, could anyone doubt  that Joy was a Catholic all the way? She was  always devout, but in the last few years, her  devotion became  intense; daily Mass and  Communion, many acts of charity and gener osity, and always an attitude of humility  and self accusation.  Not only was she devout. She was staunch,  in the best sense of the word. In the most ac tive sense of the word. She was a pillar of  pro-life activities here  in Orange County.  You could see her picketing abortion clinics  with her kids in a stroller. There was the  time her picketing friends came by her house  with signs of their own and shouting slogans:  ""We are, pro-Joyce! We are, pro-Joyce.""  She campaigned for the good guys. In the  words of her friend, ""She was the glue that  held everything together, even when things  got sticky.""  And if a modernist theologian dared to set  foot in Orange County to peddle his hetero dox  theology, she was  there. How many of  you remember the visit of Father Raymond  Brown? Joyce was there. It was his last visit  to Orange County.  She had  this  idea for a prayer letter-a  forty hours devotion where people from all  ",1994
124,House,103,-0.402,452,7,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, small  business is a vi tal and truly American  part of our economy. Small business  creates good jobs and provides the op portunity  to  realize  the American  Dream.  Unfortunately, the skyrocketing cost  of health care  is  threatening  small  business.  Four out of five small businesses al ready provide health coverage for their  employees. Because  small businesses  don't have the buying power of large  firms, they face an uphill climb against  larger  corporations.  Small  business  owner&-who can  least afford  it-are  paying 35 percent more than big busi ness for health care.  President Clinton understands  this  problem and that's why his plan will  level  the health care playing  field.  Under President Clinton's plan small  business will have the purchasing clout  to contain health costs. And  small,  low-wage business will  receive  large  discounts of 25 to 85 percent for health  care coverage.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is clear President  Clinton's health care plan is a big win ner for American small business and  the American people.  REPUBLICANS  SHARE  ADMINIS TRATION'S  CONCERNS  ABOUT  HEALTH CARE REFORM.  (Mr. LINDER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1994
125,House,103,0.559,452,7,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker, yester day, Mrs. Clinton spoke emotionally  about the need for health care reform.  After hearing heartwrenching stories  from  families who had spoken about  high costs and cancelled insurance, she  asked, ""How could it be that everyone  doesn't share your concerns?"" Well,  Mrs. Clinton, everyone does share their  concerns. And if the President would  support the Michel plan or a bipartisan  health care reform plan like Rowland Bilirakis, we might be able  to help  these people.  Instead,  the White House continues  to demand that health care reform in clude employer mandates that would  cost America hundreds of thousands of  jobs. Where is the First Lady's concern  for those people who will be thrown out  of work if the President's plan passes?  Job loss has been estimated at over 1  million jobs under the Clinton plan. In  my State of Georgia, job loss has been  estimated at over 28,000 working Amer icans.  Mrs. Clinton, we care about the peo ple you heard from yesterday and we  care about the American worker. Most  importantly, we care about crafting a  health care reform bill that will pro vide quality medical care to our citi zens without costing so many Amer ican jobs.  Mrs. Clinton, you can do better and  you must.

Mr. Speaker, today is an annual day  of national prayer, and yet, Mr. Speak er,  the media have said and has pre tended that we do not have a prayer to  pass this bill. Well, Mr. Speaker, if we  ever needed  a  prayer, we need one  today, because assault weapons have  got to be taken off our streets.  We are not  talking about quashing  the  right  for upstanding citizens  to  own weapons or  their constitutional  right to own firearms. We are talking  about 19 specific types of firearms that  are high-powered, that are combat-type  firearms,  that must be  taken off our  streets.  It is a national day of prayer, Mr.  Speaker, and I hope that we get a pray er  through and ban assault weapons  like we should in this country.  AN EMPLOYER MANDATE WILL DO  NOTHING BUT GROW  (Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut asked  and was given permission  to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  ",1994
127,House,103,0.122,452,7,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, if an employer mandate were  enacted, my State would  lose 14,300  jobs.  As we debate yet another mandate on  America's employers, let us not forget  the  real world  implications of such  mandates. I challenge each of my col leagues to find one government man date that has not been expanded over  time. Further, while many in this Con gress have labored to describe the em ployer  tax  to pay 80 percent of pre miums as anything other than a tax, I  challenge each of my colleagues to find  a  tax on employers that hasn't grown  with time. One need only look as far as  the HI tax or the OASDI or FICA tax.  Does anyone remember the temporary  2-perJent surcharge for unemployment  compensation which was recently ex tended for the umpteenth time?  My colleagues, years of experience at  the State level provides us with plenty  of real world examples of how a limited  government mandate does nothing but  expand over time. For example, many  of the reform proposals before us today  have provisions which would override  State health benefit mandates. Yet  what has the experience been with ben efit mandates? The answer is simple,  these mandates have priced millions of  Americans out of the health insurance  market.  By pursuing an employer mandate at  the Federal level we are courting disas ter. Such a mandate would have no where to go but up, and each time Con gress in its infinite wisdom decides to  expand this mandate we will encounter  another round of layoffs as employers  on the margin are forced out of busi ness. Early last year this Congress en acted  the  family and medical  leave  mandate, already  this year  there are  calls for expanding the mandate to re quire employers to provide paid leave.  The startling precedent is  there, one  only has to look to find countless ex amples of expanding mandates.  The ironic part of this whole debate  is that employer mandates are not nec essary  for  real,  effective,  successful  health care reform. We should be focus ing on the specific solutions to the spe cific problems of our unemployment  compensation system for which there  is broad bipartisan support and move  forward  to enact  real bipartisan  re form.

128,House,103,-0.407,465,7,Mr. BROOKS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of the rule crafted by  the Rules Committee for consideration  of H.R. 4296.  Some of you might legitimately won der why I am here today instead of ne gotiating with  the Senate  in a  con ference meeting on the crime bill-the  No. 1 issue concerning all Americans  across this country. I am here because  of the delay sought by proponents of  H.R. 4296 from having a simple up or  down vote on the assault weapon issue  immediately following the April 21 pas sage of the crime bill. That certainly  was my preference. At the very least, I  had hoped that we could have a sepa rate vote the following week-the week  of April 25. That also was not to be.  The  proponents  sought  additional  time to try to convince all who might  listen that this ill-conceived initiative  would, in a single stroke, stop all vio lent  crime  in America. Whether  it  would  infringe on  the second amend ment rights of honest American gun  owners who use arms for  lawful pur poses such as target shooting, hunting,  and self-defense, never entered  their  minds, and now 2 weeks after the crime  bill passed, the House finally has before  it a bill, H.R. 4296, that closely tracks  the Feinstein amendment appearing in  the Senate crime bill. Given this his tory, I think it is appropriate that the  Rules Committee, after careful delib eration, chose  to adopt a closed rule  not allowing  any perfecting  amend ments that favor one side or the other.  The opponents of H.R. 4296---of which  I  am proud  to  include myself-have  bent over backwards to be fair in every  way. At both the Judiciary Crime Sub committee and then again at full com mittee, the proponents of this bill were  given  full  opportunity  to  offer any  amendments they wished. And they did  so. Some other Members came to the  Rules  Committee  seeking  further  amendments. But the pro's and con's of  this issue have been laid out exhaus tively in a number of Congresses.  For this and other reasons, I believe  the rule before us making no additional  amendments  in order  is  the proper  rule. The rule provides for a generous  amount of time for general debate and  then  the House can get on with  the  vote. And after the vote, the House will  then have a position on the issue, and  the crime bill conferees--finally-can  begin to do the real work of the Amer ican people.

129,House,103,0.446,465,7,Mr. THOMAS of Wyoming.,"  Mr.  Speaker, my wife always reacts to that  single Member business, but, at any  rate, I appreciate the opportunity, and  I rise in opposition to the rule and to  the bill.  Despite  Secretary Bentsen's  com ments otherwise, the battle to protect  the  second  amendment  is  indeed  a  grassroots campaign. I have heard from  hundreds of  law-abiding citizens and  gun owners in Wyoming that are op posed  to  this  legislation: Sportsmen,  law enforcement officers, and citizens  who want to protect their rights.  For example, let me read a little bit  from a grassroots group, and I quote:  We've got to get serious about crime. But  a weapons ban is like shooting in the dark.  History assures us the only people affected  by  the ban are honest folks-the potential  victims-not the criminals. In reality, we're  disarming  the  law-abiding, making  them  easy targets for violent criminals who roam  our streets at will.  Mr. Speaker,  I have been  listening  closely as this debate has gone on, and  I just want to make a couple of points,  kind of deviating  from my previous  thought. First of all, this is not a spe cific bill. I quote here and show my col leagues the correspondence from Sen ator LARRY CRAIG and the Department  of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and  they list-they list the following fire arms up here  that meet  the general  characteristics of this bill. It is not  specific. Indeed there is a  long list of  weapons that could very well be.  The other one  is that, if anyone in  this place thinks that the bad guys are  not going to get a weapon to do what  they want to do, that is the greatest  fallacy I have ever heard. If we thought  for a minute that banning some arms  was going to keep people who wanted  to commit crimes with weapons from  doing that, everyone would be for that.  We know that is not the case. We know  that is not going to happen.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  vote against the rule and the bill.  STATEMENT OPPOSING BAN ON ASSAULT  WEAPONS  (By Joel Carlston, Wyoming President of  Americans Against Gun Control [AAGC])  Right now this body is considering a ban  on  certain  semi-automatic weapons. This  begs the question, ""Why a ban?""  The answer, obviously a political one,  is  ""We need to address crime in this Nation and  protect the people of the United States. Ban ning semi-automatic weapons is a step in the  right direction.""  The facts differ with this political answer.  Ninety-eight percent of serious crimes do not  involve firearms. Thus, a complete weapons  ban could at best address only 2 percent of  the problem.  In fact, more kids get killed  playing little league baseball than from assault weapons. Should we ban little league  baseball?  What about assault weapons and crime?  Florida State University criminology profes sor Gary Kleck estimates that less than  .5  percent of all violent crimes  involve  so called assault weapons.  Chicago is a case in point. In 1993,  there  were over 940 homicides. More than 30 per cent were police shootings, another 30 per cent were suicides, and not one homicide in volved the use of a semiautomatic rifle. Fur ther, over one hundred homicides were com mitted with the use of duct tape and hose,  i.e.  strangulation. Perhaps, we would  be  more effective in addressing crime if we were  to ban hose or at least specify a  five-day  waiting period for the purchase thereof.  Consider this. Of all weapons confiscated  by law enforcement in this Nation, only 4  percent were assault weapons. Of that 4 per cent, 87 percent were confiscated in searches,  not used in the commission of any crime.  We've got to get serious about crime. But  a weapons ban is like shooting in the dark.  History assures us the only people affected  by the ban are honest folks-the potential  victims-not the criminals. In reality, we're  disarming  the  law-abiding, making  them  easy targets for violent criminals who roam  our streets at will.  Why do criminals roam  the streets? Be cause we waste our valuable time on useless  Brady bills, weapons bans and other gun  confiscation measures instead of addressing  crime as constituents demand.  Patrick Purdy is an example of the ineffec tiveness of gun control laws and the need to  address crime itself. Purdy, you will recall,  was  the crazed madman who gunned down  students in a California school playground.  Mr. Purdy's record speaks for  itself. He  spent several months  in a California psy chiatric hospital. He had seven prior felony  arrests, four of which were firearms related.  On Purdy's last arrest, a police psychiatrist  stated that Purdy was a menace to himself  and to society. Yet, each of these felonies  were plea-bargained down  to misdemeanors  and Purdy was released. Consequently, as a  result of our revolving door justice system,  Mr. Purdy was legally allowed to purchase  weapons-having complied with California's  15-day waiting  period-even  though  his  record clearly  showed his  instability and  criminal intent. The rest is history-a tragic  but real example of  the  ineffectiveness of  gun control laws.  To further illustrate, let's look at States  which have implemented some form of gun  control:  New Jersey: 1967-1989-violent crime has  increased 223 percent. The Attorney Gen eral's office reports ""There is not a  really  high percentage of crimes committed with  assault weapons."" Only 1 percent of any kind  of rifle was used in homicides from 1987-1992,  compared to knives (28 percent), and feet (11  percent). This tells us that it is not the con figuration of the weapon which makes it an  assault weapon, but the intent of the assail ant wielding it.  Massachusetts: 1967-89-violent crime has  increased 429%. 1986--91-only 0.5% of homi cides involved are ""assault rifles.""  Connecticut: 1967-89-violent crime has in creased 434 percent. Connecticut law enforce ment reports no assault weapons homicides  through  1991. And of  the  11,000 weapons  seized by police between 1988 and 1992, only  1.8 percent were assault weapons.  ""Has  crime  decreased  anywhere  United States?"" you ask.  Yes.  the  in  ",1994

131,House,103,-0.084,478,7,Mr. VALENTINE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  have many fond memories of hunting  ducks and geese with my sons in east ern North Carolina.  My  father  taught me  the  joys of  hunting. He also gave me a healthy re spect for  the sanctity of life.  I hope  that I have done the same for my chil dren, and that they will be able to do  the same for their children.  No one on this floor  today, and no  one who has ever served in this august  body, has ever believed more strongly  in preserving a citizen's constitutional  rights than do I.  But, no one  in  this body  is more  aware than I am of the daily escalation  of weaponry  facing our  law enforce ment officials and other citizens. No  one is more concerned about the chil dren of this country who,  instead of  playing dodge ball, are having to learn  to dodge bullets fired from semi-auto matic weapons.  We,  in Congress, have the sworn re sponsibility to preserve and defend the  Constitution and the rights it bestows  on our citizens. We also have a respon sibility to promote the safety and well being of our citizens.  Mr. Chairman; there is no place  in  this country where it is legal to carry  a sawed-off shotgun. The right to bear  arm does not give an American  the  right to park a Howitzer in the garage.  It is time to put a stop to the pro liferation of dangerous weapons such as  the AK-47, the Street Sweeper, and the  Striker 12. These weapons serve no rea sonable,  lawful purpose except to kill  people.  God help us all if we do not seek to  bring sanity back  to our cities and  towns, to get these weapons of war off  of our streets.  Recently, I received a letter from a  Federal judge in North Carolina. In his  letter, Judge Earl Britt writes,  I was raised in the country * * *. I have  been a lifelong hunter. I am an active quail  and deer hunter.  I value and cherish  the .  hunting heritage and have passed it on to my  two  sons, and hope  to pass  it on  to my  present and future grandsons.  However, something must be done about  the proliferation of assault weapons  and  handguns. The carnage in our society from  these  type weapons has reached crisis pro portions. For the sake of our child:en and  grandchildren, please cast your vote for this  sensible legislation.  I  urge my  colleagues,  especially  those concerned about  the  rights of  gunowners and  innocent citizens,  to  listen to the wisdom of Judge Britt and  join me in support of this legislation.

132,House,103,-0.168,478,7,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Chair man, I support the assault weapon ban  because very simply, I believe that it  will save lives. Let me be clear, I do  not think it will reduce crime in Amer ica. Hopefully  the measures  in  the  crime bill will do that.  What this bill does is to reduce the  number of victims of violent crime.  This measure simply saves lives.  The most important thing  this bill  does is to ban large capacity clips like  those  used  in  the  recent California  schoolyard and New York commuter  train killings in which dozens of people  died. In fact, the madman in New York  was subdued only when he stopped to  reload.  We cannot stop sick individuals from  getting guns, but what we can do  is  make it harder for them to get weap ons equipped  to  fire dozens of shots  without reloading. This is the real ef fect of this legislation.  I  support the second amendment.  I  grew up in a culture that values andre spects guns. I enjoy hunting and have  ",1994

I want  to bring out just one  point that has not been brought out.  This was delivered  to me by Preston  Covey, a Ph.D. and associate professor  of philosophy of the Carnegie Mellon  University. He wrote a  letter  to me  today.  He said,  I am a  civilian member of the Training  Criteria Committee of the International As sociation of Law Enforcement Firearms In structors. I specialize  in law and ethics of  deadly force and one-handed weaponcraft for  officer survival over the full spectrum of po lice firearms.  This ban would put pro bono services to  law enforcement flat out of business.  Mr. Covey continues to say,  I am a handicapped person for whom semi automatic firearms are as crucial as an auto matic transmission of a car. Semi-automatic  weapons are my best option in self-defense.  In addition, every long gun I own has been  modified with a pistol-grip stock as an acces sory which is banned by this bill.  This bill is ill-conceived, and I urge  Members to vote against the bill.  ",1994

Point 5 percent of all murders are  caused by assault weapons. That  is  compared  to 16 percent by knives, 5  percent by physicians and 4 percent by  clubs. Each year 2.4 million Americans  defend  themselves with firearms  that  now the proponents of this bill are say ing they will not need anymore because  we have midnight basketball leagues.  Meanwhile,  in  Switzerland  every  male age 20  to 45  is issued an assault  rifle which he takes home, uses it to  defend  the nation and himself. Are  they a nation of marauders, no. It has  one of the lowest murder rates in the  world.  Washington, DC, Jamaica, strict gun  control, high murder rates. What is the  difference? Family values and a penal  system that punishes the criminal, not  law abiding citizens.  ",1994

137,House,103,0.154,491,7,Mr. HOUGHTON.," Mr. Chairman,  stand here to support this ban.  I was somebody who was on the fence  for a long period of time. I made up my  I  mind last night. It is difficult for me. I  am a member of the NRA.  I  respect  that organization. I  think it has been  much maligned.  I  respect  the people  who are members of that organization  in the area in which I  live. So, there fore, it was difficult.  And I hear all the arguments that it  is a phoney issue and the statistics do  not add up and it is the camel's nose  under the tent, all the things like that.  But I think every so often people like  myself who  come  from  rural  areas,  where there are not a  lot of murders,  there is not a lot of abuse of weapons  like  this, ought to stand side by side  with our compatriots  in  the  cities.  There  is a  crisis  in  the cities. It is  clear, whether it is drugs, whether it is  killings, whether it is unemployment.  These weapons have no place there.  Therefore,  reluctantly,  against  all  those people  that  I have dealt with  over the years, I  feel that this ban is  important  and we  should  do  it.  I,  frankly,  think it is going to hurt me  politically, but that is okay.  I guess  the only thing I can ask of the people  in my district  is not  that they nec essarily agree with me but they think  that  I  am  trying  to  think  through  something and do  the right  thing in  terms of my own heart. I think this is  the right thing to do.  I ask anyone who is hearing to sup port this ban.  0  1610  ",1994
138,House,103,0.391,491,7,Mr. DICKEY.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman,  I am standing here  today probably inadequately trying to  express what  the  little people want  done in my district. This is the Fourth  District of Arkansas. I am in it every  weekend and I am talking and listen ing, and I  read the letters.  I  talk to  them on the phone. What they are saying is enough is enough. What is hap pening  is not  just  the gun  control.  They say that gun control is just one  other means of trying to get control of  their lives.  Taxes  takes care of  the bank,  the  bank accounts. The school efforts  to  come in to their homes and tell  them  how they can teach their kids if they  are home schoolers, or private school,  is another part of it. The health care  bill,  the aura of the health care bill,  coming in and taking 14 percent of the  gross  national  product  and  telling  them when they can go to the doctor  and when they cannot.  Then here comes gun control. It is a  front. It is a deception, in their minds.  They  say people  are not  concerned  about gun control so much as they are  concerned about taking control of the  lives of the people who are making this  Nation what it is and who have made  this Nation what it is.  I am here speaking for the little per son.  I am here saying I am not nec essarily  that type of person, a  little  person, but to be considered about one  part of a percent of what our national  violent crime rate is, and not put those  people  in person,  is wrong, by  these  people. They are the victims, but the  criminals, we are putting them in pris on, we are building gymnasiums they  do not have, giving them TV's they do  not have. We are giving them benefits  in the medical field they do not have,  benefits in the legal field.  They say, ""You can have all the ap peals you want.""  These people are paying  the  taxes,  and there is bitterness that is coming,  bitterness and bitterness and bitter ness. What  they want  is  the Govern ment to stay off their back, and this  particular bill is symbolic. It is noth ing but up  there at the  top,  it is a  small percentage, but they see it as a  very large intrusion.  I ask the Members, if it is equal, go  with  the  little person. Protect  their  rights, protect what they want to have  for their own, and not have the Govern ment take a way.  ",1994
139,House,103,0.591,504,7,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Chairman, over  the  last  few days, I've contacted local law enforcement  in my congressional district and asked  them  this question: During  the  last 3 years, how  many killings in your jurisdiction have involved  the use of a semi-automatic assault weapon?  The answer I received was ""zero"".  While  I  realize  that  on  rare  occasions,  killings have occurred as a result of a semi automatic assault weapon, bottom  line is the  passage of this bill will have no impact on the  growing crime problems we have in this coun try.  Instead of demagoging about gun control,  we should be focusing our energy on passing  laws that will have an  impact on crime. Like  truth-in-sentencing  reform, habeas corpus re form, and a workable death penalty. But  the  White House and the leadership in Congress  won't hear of it.  Instead they're trying  to use  this issue to posture.  The crime bill that just passed the House is  not  the answer this country  is  looking  for to  solve  the problems we  face. Neither  is gun  control.  I think the American people will see we are  not serious about crime.  Ms.  VELAzQUEZ. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today in strong support of H.R. 4296, the As sault Weapons Ban Act. As  the Representa tive of one of the poorest districts in the coun try, I know what it's like for my constituents to  live in constant fear ol crime, and the violence  brought about by drug  trafficking and drug  use. Assault weapons, which are particularly  appealing  to gangs, drug dealers and orga nized criminals, are intimidating and deadly in struments of terror.  Opponents of  the bill, such as  the NRA,  claim that this bill will eliminate semiautomatic  hunting  rifles used by gun enthusiasts and  hunters. This is simply not true. The 19 semi automatic weapons that this bill does ban, are  designed not for sport, but for killing. No won der my constituents live in fear of their lives they  live  in a war zone. What will  it take  for  this body to understand that our young adults  are mercilessly killing  themselves and others  with these instruments of war.  Mr. Chairman, as a cosponsor of this bill,  I  urge this House to stop the violence and the  killing. Don't listen to foolish and false propa ganda, support H.R. 4296.  ",1994
140,House,103,-0.211,504,7,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise in op position  to H.R. 4296,  the Assault Weapons  Ban Act. After intensive study of this bill,  the  Constitution, the Federalist Papers and a wide  range of research materials dealing with  the  second amendment,  I have come  to believe  that  the second amendment does guarantee  Americans the right to bear arms, and that this  legislation  infringes on  the rights of law-abid ing citizens.  I represent  the 19th District of  Illinois, 27  counties in America's heartland which encom passes  large communities such as Decatur  and small towns of no more than a few fami lies.  I have  traveled my district, some 260  miles north  to south hundreds of times, and  talked with  thousands of people on  this and  other issues.  I have tried my best to explain  how crucial  this  issue  is and how we must  view it in its proper context.  I reject  the notion  that opposing  this ban  somehow means one  favors  the violence re sulting from the illegal use of firearms. Nothing  is further from the truth. Throughout my career  in public service I have supported strong crime  control measures. Anyone who steps outside  the  boundaries  of  a  civilized  society  and  harms people in his or her community should  be punished severely. If they commit a crime  with a  firearm  then we should  remove  them  from society. And  I am willing to pay for the  prisons and jails which will help us keep such  persons  from  causing  this destruction ever  again,  and perhaps provide a deterrent  to  others.  In  this debate, we  face  the classic con frontation between  rights and  responsibilities,  and it is our duty to decide where the balance  exists between those elements. My conclusion  is that as we continue to further and further re strict our  rights under  the  second amend ment-waiting periods  for certain purchases,  ever-expanding  lists  of  firearms which  are  banned-then we do serious damage to  the  amendment itself.  And my  fear extends beyond  the second  amendment to the entire Bill of Rights.  I truly  fear  the slow but  irreversible  trend  toward  more limits on our freedoms, limits which may  apply one day to firearms but in the next ap plies  to  the  rights of people  to speak or be  protected from  illegal search and seizure. Be cause  I value  those  freedoms so deeply  I  must oppose this ban.  In this political climate, I think it's important  to point out that I don't take any political action  committee donations. I'm not beholden to any  special interest group to finance my campaign  or provide any political cover in my district.  I  find myself on  the opposite side of a terribly  important  issue  from  friends and colleagues  for whom  I hold  tremendous  respect.  If  I  thought this bill would reduce crime and still  protect the rights of Americans I would be the  first to vote for it. But because I truly believe  we will  fail  the people on both counts,  I am  compelled to vote against it.  ",1994

Now, I am sure if Members of Con gress were to walk down in front of the  White House and threaten people who  were trying to go inside and interfere  with the going in and going out of the  White House of people on their regular  business, if they were to keep them up  all night in the White House, calling  and making  protests,  follow  them  home,  take down  their  license plate  numbers on their cars, if they were to  follow  the  children of persons who  worked at the White House, harassing  them in school, if they were to make  death  threats against  the persons  in  the White House and if they were  to  physically obstruct persons from going  in and out of the White House of the  United States, those Members of Con gress who are also a middle American,  would certainly expect to receive  the  full penalty of the law.  Peaceful demonstrators  in  front of  the White House, peaceful demonstra tors in front of a clinic, peaceful dem onstrators  in  front of a  synagogue,  peaceful demonstrators in front of any  religious institution, are not going to  be thrown into jail for a year and a half  as the previous speaker had indicated.  It is almost sad to me to think of the  litany that Ms. SCHENK just read of the  break-ins, of the bombings, of the burn ings, of the shootings, of the knifings,  the killings,  the  threats,  to  try  to  equate that to persons making a peace ful protest in front of the White House  over an issue over which they are con cerned is ludicrous; they are fined, as  Mr. FRANK pointed out well.  that  is  civil  disobedience,  they  are making  their points and  they are  fined and  they will certainly take their punish ment.  But that is a far, far different thing  from  the  issue we are here  today for  and I would not want anybody to mis understand that; that the threats of vi olence and the shootings, the intimida tion, the scare tactics and the damage  that has been done is real. This is noth ing  theoretical  that we are  talking  about here.

The bill is long  overdue, and  the  time  for action  is  now. We  cannot allow obstructionist  forces to block this sensible and well crafted legislation any longer.  Do not be fooled by those who will  use obscure arguments  to  stall  this  bill. This rule was necessitated only be cause a severability clause was added  I  thank  to protect the various components of  the  legislation should any particular  provision  be  found  unconstitutional.  This clause is a routine technical pro vision and is standard, boiler-plate lan guage.  The real issue at hand is whether the  Congress will take strong, concrete ac tion to stop the violence and terrorism  at women's health clinics. Women and  doctors are being harassed, terrorized,  even murdered. We  cannot stand by  and let this continue.  FACE, while not  infringing  in any  way upon  the  first amendment, pro tects women and doctors from the esca lating antichoice violence.  We have waited long enough to enact  this legislation.

The problem  is that it would be a  very minimal sentence, if it was a sen tence at all, a very minimal fine. And  the difference is the draconian aspects  of this legislation, which says that you  go to jail for a year and a half simply  for sitting in front of the door or on a  sidewalk. That does not comport with  what  I  thought American  law  is all  about in terms of justice. And the prob lem with  this  legislation  is  that  it  blurs the distinction between violence,  which  I  absolutely  abhor,  and with  nonviolent  civil  disobedience, which  has been  the hallmark,  the staple of  every single human rights, civil rights  movement in this country.

146,,103,0.338,543,7,Mr. HOKE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Ohio for yielding time  to me.  Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to vote on  final passage of next year's budget, I  keep looking over my shoulder for Rod  Serling and listening for the Twilight  Zone's theme song, because what I am  hearing and seeing is simply unreal.  We have got a  $4.6  trillion public  debt, a $225 billion budget deficit and  yet the Clinton White House and all of  its minions here in Congress have offi cially declared victory and they have  left the budget battlefield.  The President and his supporters in  Congress want the American people to  believe that the budget battle has been  fought and won. Rod Serling, where are  you when we need you to bring us back  to reality?  Ladies and gentlemen,  the Federal  Government's budget is completely out  of control. Spending will continue  to  increase every single year under this  budget and every claim to the contrary  notwithstanding,  this budget plan  ig nores all of these problems and keeps  feeding the Federal Government's insa tiable  appetite  for more  taxes  and  more spending.  Even the modest $26 billion in spend ing cuts that the Senate tried to  in clude in this budget were far too draco-'  nian for all  the President's men. Oh,  no. Apparently  realizing  that  these  cuts could not be completely ignored,  the House and the Senate Budget Com mittee added $13 billion in new spend ing back into the plan and now  they  are asking us to approve their handi work.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  cannot  strongly  enough urge all of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to ignore the  siren calls of the Clinton White House  and the House's Democratic leadership  to support this resolution and instead  join with me and many others in re jecting this bill because it is a fantasy  land budget that ignores the real fiscal  problems that are facing our Nation.  Vote this budget down. Get out of the  Twilight Zone and join the rest of us in  the real world where we balance our  checkbooks, we raise our families, and  we do not spend money that we do not  have.  ",1994

There being no objection,  the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  NEVADA ASSOCIATION OF  LATIN AMERICANS, INC.,  Las Vegas, NV, October 1, 1993.  HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON,  White House, Office of the First Lady,  Washington, DC.  DEAR FIRST LADY: Thank you for the enor mous work you are doing for the Health Care  Reform. I know you received over 700,000 let ters and my letter won't add anything new  to the fund of knowledge you already have.  However, I want to share with you our ex periences here with Insurance companies. As  you are  testifying on Capitol Hill, we are  being rejected by an HMO Insurance Carrier  because one of our staff members has diabe tes and two are pregnant. We are a small  non-profit, social service agency, with a staff  of twenty-three, which serves primarily the  economically  disadvantaged Hispanics  of  Southern Nevada. Our agency has been in ex istence  for 25 years. The only benefit our  staff  receives  is Group Health  Insurance.  Most of our staff start at $4.50 an hour. We  are not insurable as a group because of the  pre-existing conditions of three staff mem bers.  Please do whatever  is  in your power  to  fight for us. We need the SECURITY of Uni versal Coverage which the President spoke  about at the Joint Congressional Session. As  far as we are concerned, Health Care Reform  is not a political issue-it is our life and the  life of poor people we serve. Please do not  allow the Congress to delay the passage of  the Health Care Reform Bill. We cannot wait  without health insurance.  I wish you all the success in this endeavor.  Sincerely,  AVI L.

150,,103,0.356,569,7,Mrs. HUTCHISON.,"  I will certainly  yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, re garding applicability of the Levin sub stitute  to  legal expense  trust  funds.  Senate Resolution 508 provides for the  establishment of and contributions to  legal expense trust funds by Senators notwithstanding the provisions of the  Senate gift rule.  Therefore,  the  sponsor of  the  sub stitute is at least partially correct in  concluding that the legal expense trust  fund  resolution overrides  the  limits  contained in the gift rule. But the sub stitute also contains an amendment to  the gift rule which I intended to over ride the legal expense trust fund reso lution.  Since  the  Ethics  Committee  is  charged with regulating and overseeing  legal expense trust funds, it will have  to determine the total effect which this  new gift language will have on legal ex pense trust funds.  There can be no doubting the breadth  and reach of the Levin substitute. And  at least in one instance, the Levin sub stitute prohibits certain contributions  to legal expense trust funds that pre viously were allowed under the resolu tion.  What the committee will have to ask  itself is whether the true effect of the  substitute is to override Senate Reso lution 508, not only as it applies to lob byists-because of an explicit provision  in the bill-but also as it applies to ev eryone else, because of its extremely  broad reach and its exhaustive and spe cific list of exemptions.  The answer to this question, as with  so many others raised by this language  is: we don't know. And if you happen to  choose the wrong answer, your career  is over.  I am sure the Senator from Michigan  will say he altered the Wellstone pro posal  so  the Justice Department no  longer would be supervising  the gift  rule. But I think it is not much of an  alteration in the sense that the horror  that would come down on Senators  would just come from a different direc tion.  Let me  just give  the Senator from  Texas a hypothetical under the Levin  proposal,  somewhat  changed  from  Wellstone in the sense that the Justice  Department does not supervise it but  the Ethics Committee does. Probably  what would happen  is  that reporters  would stake out the Monocle. And if a  Senator is fortunate as to have a $25  lunch, or maybe his wife or his chil dren, with constituents-snap a picture  of it, send it to the Ethics Committee,  and you are off to the races with a po tentially career-ending offense.  So it would be just another version of  the same thing the Senator from Texas  was subjected to. So I commend her for  personalizing  this  issue  so Senators  may get a sense of what lies ahead.  I said before the Senator from Texas  came over here, and I want to repeat  throughout the morning, that as vice  chairman of the Ethics Committee  I  can say without fear of contradiction  that within 6 months of passage of the  Levin-Wellstone proposal,  some Sen ator will have his or her reputation and  career permanently damaged.  ",1994
151,Senate,103,-0.192,582,7,Mr. JOHNSTON., Will  the Senator  yield?  ,1994
152,Senate,103,-0.362,608,7,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, this is  a very simple amendment.  I will be  willing to enter into a very short time  agreement or, if you want, to just de scribe  the amendment,  let the Mem bers voice their opinions and then vote  on it.  One  of  the  strongest objections  I  have had to the Levin proposal is not  that  lobbyists  are  prohibited  from  making any kind of a gift or contribu tion to a Senator, but because all other  gifts are limited to $20. I must say I do  not understand an arbitrary figure of  $20.  The principal objection I have had to  both the Feingold-Wellstone and Levin  proposals is the one that was voiced by  the Senator from Kentucky, and that  is:  I  think you are  laying minefields  where innocent Senators are going to  get in big-time trouble, inadvertently  and innocently.  What if a gift came into my office in  a box and I ignored it, or did not think  about it? One day, I say to somebody,  ""What is this gift?"" They say, ""I don't  know."" And you open it up and it is a  Rolex watch.  I send it back, but maybe 31  to 60  days has gone by. And let us just as sume that you have a political adver sary and some staff member tells him  about it. The first thing you know, you  have a complaint lodged with the Eth ics Committee because you did not re turn the gift within 30 days.  Or let us assume that you have din ner some evening, not with a  lobbyist  but with some other person, and the  people at the next table hear the dis cussion about who is going to pick up  the  tab. You go  through  the bill and  you say, ""Look, I have to pay for ev erything in excess of $20."" And he says,  ""OK, I'll get the tip."" And let us as sume that you have a $50  to $100 bill  and the tip is anywhere from $15 to $25,  whatever, and somebody hears that and  reports that to the Ethics Committee,  that a Senator received in excess of $20.  And, incidentally, I want to point out  that my amendment does not change  any of the exceptions that are listed in  the Levin proposal, but I do want to  read one thing here to you. ""The sub stitute would also prohibit""-this  is  from  the Democratic Policy Commit tee. It is not from the bill. ""The sub stitute would also prohibit any other  person, that is, other than a  lobbyist,  from providing gifts of more than $20  to Members and staff.""  That means constituents, constitu ents coming  into  town.  I had  lunch  with a good friend yesterday who was  in  the State  legislature when  I was  Governor. He insisted on taking me to  lunch. This bill did not have anything  to do with  that. But I  took him  to  lunch. We all normally take constitu ents to lunch. But under this bill, if he  took me to lunch I would have to ei ther say let us go to McDonald's, where  I could be reasonably sure if he insisted  I  I  on picking up the tab that I was not  going to get handcuffs put on me, or I  would have  to  let him know  that  would pay my own way,  to which he  would  take some offense  think-or  make a computation at the table after  dinner or after lunch, to make sure he  did not pay more  than $20  for my  lunch.  Here is my amendment. Every place  in this bill where it says ""$20,"" insert  ""zero.""  I know how much ""zero""  is.  That means nobody can give you any thing. I do not have a problem living  with that. Through sheer inadvertence,  there will  probably  be  times when  things come into my office that I am  not aware of-maybe even staff is not  aware of. But when somebody comes  into my office and lays a bottle of wine  on the table my Secretary is going to  have to call every liquor store in town  or just have an office policy of sending  it back, which is probably what I will  do  if my amendment fails. Because I  just do not want to get into this deter mining whether something is worth $20  or not.  It is bad enough in today's $100 pro posal. I said this morning that I have a  wonderful secretary. She is as ethically  conscientious, as anybody I have ever  known in my life. As I said she keeps  the Ethics Committee and Rules Com mittee on autodial. And if something  comes in that she has the least ques tion about the value she calls all over  town to make sure the value does not  exceed $100. It is hardly worth the ef fort.  By the same token you do not like to  hurt somebody's feelings, either, say ing I am sorry I cannot take your gift.  Let me digress  just a moment, Mr.  President, just to tell you this. When I  ran for Governor the first  time,  talk  about naive, you talk about a country  boy come  to  town,  that  is  the  first  time I  realized  that campaigns oper ated on cash. I was just a country law yer, but I had enough sense to account  for  every  single dollar we  took  in,  though  the  law didn't require  it.  I  would say that well over 50 percent of  our contributions were in cash. And we  documented every penny of it-just a  little native intelligence saved me.  I  remember  a woman  handed me  what I  thought was a package of gum  at a rally. She told me she was on wel fare and this is all she could give me  but she was hot for me for Governor.  She handed me what I  thought was a  package of spearmint gum. When I got  back  to  the office  I  took it out and  looked at it. She had very carefully re wrapped  every  stick  that had been  gum, and in 2 of them, very carefully  folded, a $1 bill.  We wrote down, ""$2, anonymous gum  wrapper,"" in our books.  But the story I was about to tell you  is I got a $5,000 contribution  in $100  bills. Things like that, I must confess,  frightened me when I was running.  I  I  ""I  had no  idea people gave money  like  that. I did not know campaigns dealt in  cash.  One of my friends brought the money  to me.  said,  do not  like  this.""  There was nothing wrong with it, noth ing illegal about it under our laws at  that time.  He said-! know this sounds a little  self-serving-he said, ""I promise you  this guy just wants good government.""  Incidentally, I found out some people  wanted a little more than good govern ment after I was inaugurated. But, be  that as it may-! took the money home  that night. And I could not sleep. The  next morning I took it back and I said,  ""You give it back. I do not feel com fortable with it, and I am not going to  take money from anybody for any rea son that I feel uncomfortable with, and  I certainly feel uncomfortable and with  that much cash.""  The giver was a perfectly fine gen tleman. There was nothing wrong with  him.  I  just did not  feel comfortable  with it. But I can tell you one thing,  ""he has not liked me to this day.""  If you think you can turn somebody's  campaign contribution down and make  them like it, I do not care what ration ale you use, you are fooling yourself.  You  are  effectively  saying,  ""your  money isn't good enough for me."" And  you do not win friends that way.  So there is a little of that in this bill.  Some people are going to be offended  without realizing that it is the law we  are trying to comply with;  trying to  meet and dampen  the cynicism  that  does indeed exist toward politicians in  this country.  One  thing that is disturbing is that  the bill seems accusatory. Every Sen ator i know in this body does his very  best to comply with every rule of the  Rules Committee and every rule of the  Ethics Committee. But my point  is  this: Here it says every year the Rules  Committee would  be  authorized  to  change the $20 limit to the extent nec essary to adjust for inflation. So if you  think $20  is hard  to figure out,  is it  more than $20 or is it $19 or is it $21, in  1995 you are going  to have  to figure  out, assuming  the  inflation rate  is 3  percent,  is  the gift worth more  than  $20.60 or less than $20.60? And, in 1996 is  it worth more or less than $20.78?  What kind of nonsense is this? It will  be infinitely easier, and if you want to  allay the cynicism, the distrust of the  people in this country just to say no to  any and all gifts. If the purpose of this  bill is to convince people that we are  honorable people-all I am telling you  is, it is a lot easier to compute some thing if it does not exist-we know the  value of zero-than it is to try to figure  out whether something is worth $19.95  or $20.05.  So all my amendment does, is leave  the exceptions,  leaves all  the excep tions in of the LEVIN bill. But it would  simply say: No gifts from anybody.  ",1994

155,Senate,103,0.356,738,7,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to talk about our Nation's  welfare system. Almost 30 years ago a  fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson declared  an unconditional war on poverty. Un fortunately,  this country has not yet  won that war. Our welfare programs,  created with the intention of providing  assistance to those in despair, has been  defeated  by  the  disincentives  that  plague America's inner cities. Unfortu nately, adding to our troubled entitle ment programs are the abuses of the  system  that prevail  in many of our  cities. There are too many welfare re cipients  receiving benefits  to which  they are not entitled. Our State and  local governments are burdened with  inefficient fraud prevention procedures  that perpetuate the abuses in the sys tem.  Today, I am introducing a bill to de tect, investigate and prosecute fraud in  the Aid  to Families With Dependent  Children [AFDC] program through fin gerprint identification systems. AFDC  fraud is a costly problem that will not  go away if left unaddressed. We need  dramatic changes  in  fraud detection  programs. People all over the world see  the United States social service system  as a ticket to free benefits. Fake birth  certificates,  fake  green  cards,  and  phony Social Security cards are sold  openly  in Puerto Rico, Haiti,  and  China. Cooperation among Federal and  State agencies is necessary to detect  the abusers. A  fingerprinting  identi fication system is a solution to identifying the cheaters.    Examples of  fraud  are  evident  in  every State. According to the National  Taxpayers Union, Maria Lopez and her  17  relatives might still be defrauding  welfare departments in five States. As  a migrant  farm worker, Maria  col lected welfare benefits in Washington,  Nebraska, Oregon, and Wyoming. Fol lowing  in her success, 17 of her rel atives opened welfare accounts in those  States. Had caseworkers in the various  States bothered to check they would  have found all 18 persons claiming the  same address or post office box. In Min nesota, a man was convicted of welfare  fraud, assault and terrorist threats re lated to using at least six names and  even more Social Security numbers.  That man defrauded the welfare system  of $10,490. Governor Wilson of Califor nia said last month ""You can use a  phony social security card or a phony  name, but nobody can use a phony fingerprint."" The use of a fingerprinting  system to verify the identify of recipi ents will work to reduce and prevent  fraud in the system. Reducing fraud in  the system will cut costs and make  sure that those who are really in need  are  receiving assistance. States  that  have experimented with fingerprinting  programs have produced dramatically  better results in combating fraud than  those States expending resources and  effort on other deterrence programs.  The fingerprinting system works. In  June 1991, Los Angeles County began  taking computer fingerprints from ap plicants  for  the State general  relief  program. That program has saved Los  Angeles County $5.4 million during the  first 6 months of its operation and is  projected to save about $18 million over  5 years. The program was so successful  that 2 weeks ago, Los Angeles County  announced commencement of the fin ger-imaging system in the AFDC pro gram. According to Governor Wilson's  office the fingerprinting project is ex pected to save taxpayers a total of $4.2  million in its first year of operation.  Programs  in New York have  also  been successful. A study conducted by  the New York Department of Social  Services  estimated  that New York  could  save $46 million a  year  if it  adopted  a  statewide  finger-imaging  system.  According to a recent Inspector Gen eral's report, the evidence of fraud that  occurs in our local office goes unno ticed and worse yet unpunished. In that  report, one eligibility worker stated  ""After all my work proving that she  was a fraud, she only got a slap on the  wrist and an order to repay the money.  * * * I know she'll do  the same thing  again, but why should I waste my time  sending it to the investigator. She will  just be back in here  laughing in my  face again."" The Inspector General of  nns reported that the presence of an  active, visible and effective fraud  in vestigation function is critical to the  integrity  of  the  AFDC  program.  Fingerprinting welfare  recipients has  proven to be an effective mechanism to  attack  the abuses of  the  system. A  fingerprinting  system  coupled with  real prosecutorial mechanisms to deal  with perpetrators is desperately needed  in our local welfare offices.  With both  the President and Con gress focusing on the reform of our wel fare system, attention to eligibility is  critically important. In 1991,  the De partment of Health and Human Serv ices reported that roughly 65 percent of  the cases reported in 1991 had evidence  sufficient  to  support  a  question  of  fraud. This number represents only the  percentage of cases that have been re-  ported. As the Inspector General report  indicates,  there may  also be many,  many cases that go unreported due to  inadequate preeligibility requirements  and  inadequate  investigative  tech niques.

158,House,103,0.425,816,7,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, a  few days ago Newsweek published an  article the likes of which I have never  seen before concerning a current Presi dent. Titled ""The Politics of Promis cuity,"" it examines the basic question  of President Clinton's character. De spite the title, it is not a sleazy story.  It is not a partisan story. What it is, is  a lamentable story, and regrettably, in  the  case  of  this White House,  an  unending one.  The  article's  writes that:  Joe Klein,  author,  Paula Jones' story will  join  the  rising  landfill  of  allegations  of  personal mis behavior that Bill Clinton has had to deny,  deflect. defend, derail. It has heft only be cause there have been so many others, and  because it reinforces a widely held suspicion  about the precise nature of the president's  problem.  Klein continues, ""It seems  increas ingly,  and  sadly,  apparent  that  the  character flaw Bill Clinton's enemies  have fixed upon-promiscuity-is a de fining characteristic of his public life  as well.""  The Newsweek author is not talking  about  promiscuity's most  common  meaning, but its fullest meaning-cas ual or irregular behavior. Whether at  home or abroad, this kind of careless,  cavalier conduct has been  the  trade mark of this administration.  As Klein observes, the result isWith the Clintons, the story always is sub ject to further revision. The misstatements  are  always  incremental. The  ""misunder standing"" are always  innocent-casual,  ir regular: promiscuous. Trust is squandered in  dribs and drabs.  The President has gone so long down  this road that he has come to the point  where he must hire superlawyer Bob  Bennett to address the mess. When you  hire a  superlawyer, you have super problems. Bennett will be trying to sal vage  the President's reputation. He  will have his work cut out for him.  Never before in my memory has an  administration been so  lacking in its  understanding of the basic values that  the rest of America holds dear.  President Clinton's financial dealings  are a case  in point. Recently, Presi",1994

This  bill will correct  long-standing deficiencies  in  the management and operations of one of our  Nation's most recognized and cherished build ings,  the Presidential Memorial  to John F.  Kennedy.  Members of the committee have reviewed,  analyzed, and critiqued  the bifurcated man agement structure of the Kennedy Center, and  in particular, the planning and management of  its capital program. It became apparent that, in  order  to preserve an already substantial  in vestment  in  this building, adjustments  in  the  management  structure were  needed which  would clearly place all management and oper ational  responsibility and authority with  the  Board of  the John F. Kennedy Center. This  authority  includes  planning,  designing,  and  constructing all capital projects at the Kennedy  Center. The Center will retain its authority and  responsibility  for  routine, daily maintenance.  Having the ability to manage routine mainte nance as well as planning and execution for  capital  improvements will most assuredly en hance the overall management and operation  of this special institution.  The Center will continue  in  its  leadership  role  in national performing arts programs  for  American citizens of all ages.  As always, the John F. Kennedy Center for  the Performing Arts will be the national exem plar in performing arts activities and  in edu cational programs in the arts for disabled indi viduals.  And,  the John F.

REPORT  ON  FISCAL  YEAR  1993  ACHIEVEMENTS  IN  AERO NAUTICS AND  SPACE-MESSAGE  FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  SCOTT)  laid before the House the fol lowing message from the President of  the United States; which was read and,  together with  the accompanying pa pers, without objection, referred to the  Committee  on  Science,  Space,  and  Technology:  To the Congress of the United States:  I am pleased to transmit this report  on the Nation's achievements in aero nautics and space during  fiscal year  1993, as required under section 206 of  the National Aeronautics and Space  Act of 1958, as amended (42 u.s.a. 2476).  Aeronautics and  space activities  in volve 14 contributing departments and  agencies of the Federal Government, as  this report reflects, and the results of  their ongoing  research and develop ment affect the Nation as a whole in a  variety of ways.  Fiscal year 1993 brought numerous  important changes and developments  in U.S. aeronautics and space efforts. It  included 7 Space Shuttle missions, 14  Government  launches  of Expendable  Launch Vehicles  [ELVs], and 4 com mercial launches from Government fa cilities. Highlights of the Shuttle mis sions included the first in a series of  flights of the U.S. Microgravity Pay load that contained scientific and ma terials-processing  experiments  to  be  carried out in an environment of reduced gravity; the deployment of the  Laser Geodynamic Satellite  (a  joint  venture between the United States and  Italy);  the deployment of a Tracking  and Data Relay Satellite; and, the sec ond Atmospheric Laboratory for Appli cations and Science mission to study  the composition of the Earth's atmos phere,  ozone  layer,  and  elements  thought to be the cause of ozone deple tion. The ELV missions carried a vari ety of payloads ranging from Global  Positioning System satellites to those  with classified missions.  I also requested that a  redesign of  the Space Station be undertaken tore duce costs while retaining science-user  capability and maintaining  the pro gram's internatio:ual commitments. To  this end,  the new Space Station  is  based on a modular concept and will be  built in stages. However,  the new de sign draws heavily  on  the previous  Space Station Freedom investment by  incorporating most of its hardware and  systems. Also, ways are being studied  to  increase  the Russian participation  in the Space Station.  The United States and Russia signed  a Space Cooperation Agreement  that  called for a Russian cosmonaut to par ticipate in a U.S. Space Shuttle mis sion and for the Space Shuttle to make  at least one rendezvous with the Mir.  On September 2, 1993, Vice President  Albert Gore, Jr., and Russian Prime  Minister Victor Chernomyrdin signed a  series of joint statements on coopera tion in space, environmental observa tions/space science, commercial space  launches, missile export controls, and  aeronautical science.  In aeronautics, efforts  included the  development of new  technologies  to  improve performance, reduce costs, in crease safety, and reduce engine noise.  For  example,  engineers  have  been  working to produce a new generation of  environmentally compatible, economic  aircraft that will lay the technological  foundation for a next generation of air craft that are superior to the products  of other nations. Progress also contin ued on programs to increase airport ca pacity while at the same time improv ing flight safety.  In the Earth sciences, a variety of  programs  across  several  agencies  sought better understanding of global  change and enhancement of the envi ronment. While scientists discovered in  late 1992 and early 1993,  for instance,  that global levels of protective ozone  reached the lowest concentrations ever  observed,  they also could  foresee an  end to the decline in the ozone layer.  Reduced  use  of  ozone-destroying  chlorofluorocarbons would allow ozone  quantities to increase again about the  year 2000 and gradually return to ""nor mal.''  Thus, fiscal year 1993 was a success ful one for  the U.S. aeronautics and  space programs. Efforts in both areas  have contributed to advancing the Na",1994
163,Senate,103,-0.303,894,7,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce legislation, on be half of myself and my good  friends,  Senator FORD and Senator SIMON, that  will give the Secretary of Veterans Af fairs permanent authority to approve  basic educational assistance for flight  training progams. This legislation will  allow veterans to prepare for careers in  the air transportation industry as well  as help to ensure that our Nation has  an adequate supply of well-trained pi lots to meet future industry demand.  Public Law 101-237 established a 4year flight training assistance program  for veterans, which commenced on Oc tober 1, 1990. As of last December, this  program has helped more  than 2,500  veterans pursue commercial pilot  li censes and various instrument ratings  at an average cost of $3,200 per individ ual. A majority of the program's par ticipants have already secured employ ment in the aviation industry. Without  timely congressional action, however,  this successful program will expire on  September 30.  Considerable  attention  has  been  given to ensuring that those who re ceive benefits under the flight training  program are serious about a career in  aviation. To participate  in  the pro gram, a veteran must possess a valid  private pilot's license-at a cost of ap proximately $3,000-and must  satisfy  the medical requirements to obtain a  commercial license. Further, the vet eran must attend a flight school which  has been approved by the Federal A via tion Administration  [FAA]  and  the  . State agency which certifies all veter ans' educational programs. Finally, the  training must be generally accepted as  necessary for the attainment of a rec ognized  vocational  objective  in  the  field of aviation.  There are also two significant cost control features to the flight training  program. First, each veteran must pay  at least 40 percent of the cost associ ated with their training. This is a hefty  share, given the cost of flight training  programs and the investment that veteran has already made to get a private  pilot's license.  In addition,  the pro gram caps the reimbursement for solo  flying hours at the minimum number  of hours required by the FAA for any  given rating level.  Veterans  have  earned  their  edu cational benefits  through  service  to  our Nation, and they have even made  monetary contributions  toward  those  benefits. It only seems right that these  men and women are given  a  broad  array of choices as to how these bene fits can be used. Moreover, flight in struction is very costly, and many vet erans will be unable to pursue careers  in aviation unless  their educational  benefits can be used for this purpose.  Now more than ever, veterans need  expanded job training opportunities. In  a recent report, the General Account ing Office estimated that on any given  night, 150,000 to 250,000 veterans are on  the streets or in shelters. That veter ans, who served this country so self lessly, now make up one-third of the  homeless population is a tragedy which  must be addressed. I recognize that the  problems  of  homeless  veterans  are  complex and will not be easily solved.  However, because one of the primary  contributors  to homelessness  is  the  lack of adequate job training, programs  such as flight training have a  role to  play in preventing homelessness among  our Nation's veterans.  The need for greater employment op portunities for veterans is compounded  by  the military's downsizing efforts.  According to the Defense Department's  Bottom-Up review,  the Armed Forces  will have to reduce their numbers by  an additional 400,000 by fiscal year 1999.  Many veterans are now experiencing  difficulty in finding employment out side  the military, and  the exodus of  more servicepersons from all branches  of the Armed Forces will only exacer bate this problem. Clearly, then, there  is a great need for education and train ing, such as flight instruction, that is  compatible with veterans' skills and  interests.  Allowing veterans to use their edu cational benefits  to obtain flight  in struction is also good for the future of  the air  transportation  industry. Al though military downsizing is now cre ating a temporary pilot surplus, it will  ultimately result in a smaller pool of  military-trained  candidates  for  em ployment in commercial aviation. This  is because  the  current  surplus will  taper off and, more  importantly,  the  military is now training fewer pilots.  Thus, in the future,  the air transpor tation industry increasingly will have  to turn to pilots trained in the civilian  sector to meet its needs.    In August 1993, a Blue Ribbon Panel  commissioned by the FAA released a  report entitled ""Pilots and Aviation  Maintenance  Technicians  for  the  Twenty-First Century: An Assessment  of Availability and Quality.''

164,Senate,103,-0.313,907,7,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I  in troduce new legislation to create new  assurance  that  accidents  involving  pipelines  and  underground  utilities  won't occur. Every year, multiple fa tali ties and tens of millions of dollars  worth of damage occur simply because  people dig where they shouldn't. These  third-party  incidents  are  the  single  leading cause of accidents  involving  pipelines. According to the Department  of Transportation, these accidents are  responsible for over half of the fatali ties and half of the property damage.  My  legislation,  the  Comprehensive  One-Call Notification Act, will create a  mechanism to prevent the inadvertent  injury and the potential tragedy.  On March 23, just before midnight, an  explosion ripped through the community of Durham Woods in Edison, NJ.  Within minutes, eight apartment build ings were ablaze. Soon they were gone,  wiped out by a fireball that lit up the  sky over hundreds of square miles. One  life was  lost. Hundreds  lost  their  homes. Many more were evacuated.  The injuries were miraculously low.  But who knows how many others still  lie awake at night, wondering whether  it could happen again and fearing the  future.  Reflecting on the accident today, it  seems hard  to fault anyone here  for  their response to the tragedy. The com munity pulled  together  to help out  those in need. Food, emergency shelter,  general support and  financial assist ance were offered amply and uncondi tionally in the hours and days follow ing the accident.  Government and industry mobilized  quickly. Within 4 hours of the explo sion, Texas Eastern's accident response  team was en route. By morning,  the  team and senior management were on  the site, together with a strong Federal  and State presence. Before the site had  even cooled sufficiently for access, the  experts from the NTSB were there and  ready  to begin  the crucial  investiga tion.  There was likewise an aggressive ef fort to help the victims. The local high  school became a  relief center. Texas  Eastern created another center for help  and, within 3 days, had dispensed more  than $1.5 million to 250 families whose  homes were destroyed or damaged in  the fire. Within 3 days, the Small Busi ness Administration had opened an as sistance center on site and were hand ing out and processing applications for  emergency support.  However, great as this response was,  this is not what is most striking about  this accident. What  is most striking  about  the accident  is how  lucky we  were. Who would ever think that, given  the  timing and the magnitude of the  explosion, so many people-many flee ing with just the clothes they had on would escape without serious  injury?  Few who have walked around that cra ter,  seen  the  charred cars and  the  empty building foundations would dis agree with the conclusion that many  there were saved only by a miracle.  Unfortunately, miracles are a poor  basis for public policy. You can't count  on them. I am not about to count on  them. The fact is that there is no mar gin for error in this industry. The natu ral gas industry does have an excellent  safety record, especially when you con sider that 25 percent of the energy we  consume moves by these pipelines. We  have seven major pipelines that cross  the State,  and hundreds of smaller  ones. But  the Edison accident never  should have happened.  We need to acknowledge Edison for  what it is: a breakdown in the regu latory and safety program. We need to  learn about  the Edison  accident  in  ",1994

167,House,103,-0.225,1050,7,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to recognize and honor a  group in my district who used the com mon phone book as a  tool to prevent  teen violence.  If I may give a brief history. In May  of 1993 I sponsored a conference in Den ver, CO, on Teens and Violence, over  200 organizations developed  ideas and  suggestions  to help  teens  resist  the  dangerous influences in their lives. One  good suggestion was  to create a  re source directory  tailored  to  teens.  I  took this idea to our local phone book  publishers and in short order US West  Directory agreed  to donate  s:;>ace  in  their directory exclusively for  teens.  The idea further, germinated as a local  coalition of business, government, and  non-profits  organizations  undertook  the monumental task of compiling en tries for the teen pages. Thus, the Teen  Information Partnership was born.  I am extremely pleased to announce  that  through  their  efforts,  the TIP  pages will be published in the May 1994  issue of the US West Directory phone  book.  There are eight pages of resource in formation  relevant  to  teen needs  in  this directory. Everything from crisis  hotlines,  employment  information,  health,  pregnancy,  education,  and  recreation for teens is listed. There is  an aggressive campaign underway  to  advertise  these  pages  through  res taurant place mats, supermarket shop ping bags, and in the media targeted to  teens.  I would  like  to  take  this  time  to  honor those agencies involved in this  effort, they are:  Bethesda Psychiatric Hospital, Colo rado Trial Lawyers Association, Colo rado Violence Prevention Center, The  Denver District Attorneys Office, Den ver Mayor Wellington Webb's Commis sion on Youth, Denver Regional Coun cil of Governments, Denver Victim's  Service Center, Denver's First Step,  Hoffman and Company, The Governor's  Community Partnership Office, Mile  High United Way, The Shaka Franklin  Foundation for Youth, US West Direct;  YES Match, Youth Train-A Parents'  Movement,  McDonalds,  and  King  Soopers.  Without the hard work of each, this  directory would not have been possible.  ",1994
168,House,103,0.256,1063,7,Ms. MOLINARI.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Mr. Chairman, at this time I would  like to join with my colleagues from  the Committee on Public Works and  Transportation in strongly supporting  H.R. 2442. This legislation does indeed  address many of the concerns expressed  by the people who have worked closely  with  the EDA and who have spoken  previously this afternoon. It is truly a  bipartisan effort, and I must at this  point thank the gentleman from Cali fornia  [Mr. MINETA],  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania [Mr. SHUSTER],  the  ranking member,  and of course  the  Subcommittee on Economic Develop ment chairman,  the gentleman from  West Virginia [Mr. WISE], for his lead ership on this bill.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2442  represents  an  opportunity  to  finally,  after  12  years, reauthorize the EDA and ARC to  improve and upgrade  these programs.  One example of the importance of the  EDA is its role in helping communities  to adjust to base closures and defense  cutbacks.  Mr. Chairman, the 1993 Base Closure  Commission closed 130 military instal lations and realigned 45 others. This  was in addition to over 200 closures and  realignments resulting  from  the 1988  and 1991 rounds of base closures. In my  own district the closing of Naval Sta tion New York will have an enormous  economic impact. In 1992 alone it was  estimated  that  the  base  generated  more than $89 million in annual direct  economic impact with a combined pay roll of over $50 million and an operat ing budget of $30 million. As a result of  the base's closure it is estimated that  between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs, both direct  and indirect, will be lost in a pity that  can scarcely afford it. Mr. Chairman,  under  the authorizations provided  in  H.R. 2442 the EDA has a wide range of  tools  to help communities adjust  to  these base closures and to find replace ment jobs. Under title IX of EDA's re authorization, Mr. Chairman, the EDA  can and will make grants to commu nities for planning, public works con struction, revolving  loan fund assist ance and training. The authorization is  flexible enough for EDA to tailor the  adjustment package  to each commu nity's specific needs, and I suggest to  my colleagues  in  the Chamber  that  there is no other example of that abil ity to provide and respond to a State's,  and municipality's and locality's par ticular  problems  particularly  as  it  comes to base closure than that pro vided under title IX of EDA's reauthor ization. It has been 12 years, and sig nificant changes have been made  to  streamline these organizations and to  recreate their responsiveness to ever changing economies.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, H.R.  2442 refocuses EDA and ARC on to pro grams that work, and I encourage my  colleagues to support the bill. Let me  just state in closing that it has been a  tremendous opportunity to work, par ticularly with the minority staff, and  certainly with the majority staff, and I  say to Carl Lorenz, ""You will be dearly  missed, and I hope this bill will serve  as a remembrance of all the work and  dedication you have given to this full  committee and  to  this subcommittee  in particular.""

170,House,103,-0.656,1063,7,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 2442,  the Eco nomic  Development  Administration  authorization bill. I would like to com mend our chairman of the Subcommit tee on Economic Development of the  Committee on Banking, Finance and  Urban Affairs,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania [Mr. KANJORSKI]  for all  the work he has put into this legisla tion.  I had  the privilege of working  closely with Mr. KANJORSKI on this bill,  and he certainly deserves a lot of credit  for his thoughtful and speedy work to  bring the legislation to the floor.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2442 is long over due. After 12 years trying to eliminate  the EDA, we have leadership which fi nally understands the job creation, and  economic  development  and  commu nities  revitalization potential of  the  EDA.  It seemed  the Federal Govern ment abandoned Federal programs that  could have generated jobs and caused  community-based development in  the  1980's,  and  this  shortsightedness  is  clearly demonstrated by the continued  efforts to eliminate the EDA.  Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, enough  Members of Congress on both sides of  the aisle recognized the importance of  EDA to prevent its outright abolition.  However,  the program underwent se vere budget reductions. In real dollars,  EDA is now only one-fifth of its 1980  budget. This bill begins to rebuild the  EDA.  I remember the useful economic de velopment projects  the EDA  funded  when I was a State legislator in Cali fornia. EDA programs leverage several  times their allocation in private sector  funds. The  impact of EDA programs  -was far greater than their actual fund ing. That seems to be the model of pub lic-private development that this coun try strives for.  We should support this bill, and work  to enhance and broaden the EDA mis sion. I urge support for H.R. 2442.  ",1994

172,House,103,-0.509,1063,7,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of H.R. 2442 and urge all my  colleagues to vote in favor of this first  reauthorization bill  in more  than a  decade and to oppose all amendments  to cut funding for these two important  agencies or compromise the important  work that they do.  I would also like to commend Chair man WISE and my fellow New Yorker,  ranking member SUSAN MOLINARI,  for  the dedicated and cooperative biparti san spirit in which they have crafted  and moved this important legislation.  As a member of the historic freshman  class of the 103d Congress, I think it is  important to remember what was on  our constituents' minds as they went  to  the polls  in 1992 and changed the  face of our national Government.  Do you remember? It was ""the econ omy,  stupid!"" Our constituents were  fed up because they couldn't get their  children to a doctor, they couldn't hold  on to their jobs or make ends meet no  matter how hard  they worked,  and  they couldn't even take comfort in the  confidence  that  the many  sacrifices  they have made have been worthwhile  because, in America, the next genera tion always does better. For too many  of our neighbors,  the promise of the  American dream,  that  through hard  work and perseverance, you can make  it and your children will do better, was  a broken promise.  Well, people were right to be angry in  1992. That is why we got a new Presi dent and a turnover rate in this House  of 25 percent.  Does anyone  think  the voters have  forgotten why we were sent here  in  1992? Have any of us forgotten? Does  anyone here  think that we've gotten  ",1994

Ray Thompson has  been an integral part of the 5th District service  academy  selection  process  since October  1982. Since 1989, Colonel Thompson has  served on my academy advisory board. During  this time,  I have grown to know and respect  his integrity and dedication to our country.  Col. Raymond  Thompson was  born  in  Salley, SC. He attended public schools  in  Aiken  County,  and  graduated  from  A.L.  Corbett High School  in Wagner, SC.  In May  1961, he graduated from South Carolina State  College, Orangeburg, SC. He was a distin guished graduate and was commissioned a 2d  lieutenant in the U.S. Army.  From  the beginning of his military career,  Ray Thompson has set high standards  for  himself. His record of service, which has en tered  its  fourth decade,  is characterized by  self-discipline, self-motivation, and mission ac complishment. He  has  received  numerous  awards,  including  the Meritorious  Service  Medal, the Bronze Star, the Army Commenda tion Medal,  the National Service Defense  Medal, and  the Vietnam Service Medal with  four bronze stars.  Ray Thompson continues to serve our coun try today, supporting the mission of the U.S.  Military Academy in providing leaders of char acter  to  the Nation.

H.R. 300, The Older Americans Free dom to Work Act, of which I am a cosponsor,  would repeal the Social Security earnings pen alty for senior citizens and allow them to take  part  in  the economic growth of  this Nation  without fear of  losing the benefits which are  rightfully theirs.  The older Americans of  this country are  continuously being attacked by this Congress  and the current administration. They have be come targets for reducing the Federal deficit  by  increasingly  taxing  their Social Security  benefits, proposing  to  tax  their health care  benefits, and even reducing Medicare benefits.  On top of that, they are being deprived of the  ability to work by placing an earnings penalty  on any additiona~ income they may generate  as members of the workforce. I find this situa tion  to be appalling and have strongly sup ported  repealing  these  increased  taxation  measures.  I support H.R. 300 because it will  alleviate at the very least, another cross that  the older American's of  this Nation have  to  bear.  The older Americans in this country are the  most experienced workers, yet are the most  under utilized. Even when  they are utilized,  they run the risk of being penalized by the So cial Security system for the contributions they  make. It is my strong belief that those who are  able and willing  to work should not be de terred from doing so and that is why I support  H.R. 300 and why I have signed the discharge  petition  that my  esteemed  colleague, Mr.  HASTERT,  has  begun  seeking  support  for  today.  I urge my  fellow colleagues  to  join me  in  signing on  to the discharge petition to allow  this necessary piece of legislation to be ad dressed so that all the older Americans', in all  of our respected communities, will be allowed  to work and contribute, if they so choose, to  this great Nation without fear of reprisal.

I  would just say that next week if the  defense authorization bill comes to the  floor, we will have a chance to be bi partisan and to work together.  There are a number of steps  that  have been taken recently which would  place American. troops under U.N. com manders. The Vice President said re cently that he wanted to extend condo lences  to  the  families who had  lost  loved ones in Iraq in the service of the  United Nations.  Mr. Speaker, there is a deep feeling  on the part of the Clinton administra tion that the United States must sub ordinate itself to the United Nations in  Bosnia and other places. I think when   the defense authorization bill comes to  the floor, there will be a bipartisan op portunity, which Republicans will take  a  lead  role  trying  to offer some  amendments that will make clear that  American  troops  should  serve under  American commanders,  that America  should  never  be  subordinated  to  a  world  talking organization, and  that  iii,  some very serious thinking has to go  into the Clinton administration's pat tern of spending American money not  on American defense but transferring  that money out of our defense to sub sidize  the United Nations which  is  clearly ineffective, which is clearly un able  to get  the  job done, and which  clearly does not understand and is in capable of leading the world to peace  and to security.

179,House,103,0.554,1128,7,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, there is  no rest for weary Americans. For more  than  4 months,  average Americans  struggled to pay their largest ever bil1  from the taxman. In 1994, for the first  time in the post war-era, total Federal,  State, and local spending reached more  than 33 percent of GDP.  Americans might feel as though they  have earned a chance to take a deep  breath and start enjoying the frli!l.ts of  their  labors. But the fact  is,  for  the  next 2 months, wage earners will still  be working to pay for the costs of Fed eral mandates and regulations. Accord ing to Americans for Tax Refor-m, until  July of this year, families will be work ing to pay the costs of Government.  And,  it gets worse. Just  this year,  Congress has added to this burden with  a pork-laden disaster relief bill, a bu reaucratic elementary education act, a  redundant school-to-work bill, and new  restrictions on first and second amend ment rights.  These actions are typical of the way  Cong.ress  operates  today-new man dates on local government, new regula tions on small business-, new spending  masked by slashing defense and tempo rarily low interest rates, and ever-in creasing power over the lives of Ameri cans.

182,House,103,-0.402,1141,7,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in support of H.R. 2442, the Economic Devel opment Authorization Act  of  but  in  strong opposition to the amendment from my  colleague regarding the Appalachian Regional  Commission  [ARC]. This bill calls for a task  force  to study whether the Appalachian Re gional Commission  could  utilize  its  unique  characteristics to also address the economic  needs of other distressed rural areas such as  the Lower Mississippi Delta, the United States Mexico border area, and the Ozarks. By ap proving  the  gentleman's  amendment,  we  would cause great harm to these areas by de nying  them  the benefit of  the ARC's experi ence  in dealing with economic development  matters.  It has been stated by some that the ARC  has done a  lackluster  job  in  improving  the  well-being and  livelihood of  residents  in  the  Appalachian region. Well, that is not the case.  In a study entitled ""The Economic Effects of  the Appalachian Regional Commission: An  Empirical Assessment of 27 Years of Regional  Development Policy,""  researchers concluded  that when  comparing Appalachian  counties  within the ARC to non-Appalachian twin coun ties, the ARC counties grew significantly faster  in  income, earnings, population, and per cap ita income. Even further, the researchers con cluded that the ARC programs helped these  counties perform better.  The area of the county that I represent-the  United States-Mexico border region-is one of  the most severely distressed anywhere. Dou ble-digit  unemployment  rates,  high  poverty  rates, and low per capital incomes are among  the mainstays of the border economies. I feel  that application of  the ARC principles would  be extremely beneficial  in dealing with  the  problems of the United States-Mexico border  region.  Finally, this bill only authorizes a task force  to study the applicability of the ARC principles  to other distr.essed areas. This bill does not  call  for  the ARC as some  may claim.  It only calls  for a  task force  to  study  the ways  the ARC's characteristics  could be applied  in other distressed areas.  Other distressed areas could benefit from the  ARC's unique characteristics, for example, the  Federal-State partnership. This  is all  this bill  would seek to do. No expansion of the ARC  is called for. I feel that the ARC's approach to  dealing with  problems on  a  regional basis  could be beneficial for the United States-Mex ico border area.  So  I ask my  colleagues  to  reject  this  amendment for the reasons I mentioned.  It is  a wrong approach to take and I urge my col leagues to oppose it.  the e~pansion of  ",1994

186,,103,-0.472,1167,7,Mr. VENTO.," Madam Chairman,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Madam Chairman,  this  initiative,  H.R. 2473, is really the work of our col league,  the gentleman from Montana  [Mr. WILLIAMS]. The gentleman from  Montana [Mr. WILLIAMS] is not able to  be with us at this time. We have agreed  with him to proceed with the general  debate on this matter, and we assume  that all of the time will not be utilized  today.  I will be reserving 10 minutes for the  gentleman  from Montana  [Mr. WIL LIAMS] upon his return on Tuesday next  to use that time in general debate for  his statement, and I would ask the in dulgence of the other Members not to  reserve time at the end of today but to  proceed on that basis.  The gentleman  from Montana  [Mr.  WILLIAMS] is attending the graduation  of his son and left here about 30 min utes ago to try to make a plane.  Madam Chairman,  this  is an enor mously  important bill. The Montana  wilderness proposal involves 6 million  acres of land, 3 million of which is clas sified by  this bill as wilderness and  other special management areas. It is a  classification and a definition of land  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  10047  in Montana  in  terms of wilderness.  Montana has some of the largest non contiguous  blocks  of  roadless  land  along  with  Idaho,  in  this  inter mountain west region.  0 1650  It is the land that has been immor talized in the film and book by Norman  MacLain, ""A River Runs Through It.""  It is  the ""Big Sky"" country. It is a  magnificent legacy and a natural herit age in Montana. There is no place like  these lands in the world.  We in Congress have responsibility in  terms  of  stewardship,  in  terms  of  classifying  the use of such  lands,  in  terms of passing them on to future gen erations  through our actions on  this  floor in the week ahead.  The gentleman  from Montana  [Mr.  WILLIAMS] has done a great  job and  done it, I might say, with a  lot more  pressure than most of us face in terms  of this issue, as his constituents are  most immediately affected by the ac tions in this measure.  He  has  shown, Madam Chairman,  great  courage, great  insight,  and  a  great deal of work in the process. He  has  to  live  it, sleep it and eat it,  I  might say, day in and day out. We owe  to PAT WILLIAMS  and  the people of  Montana a decision on this important  issue.  Madam Chairman, this issue has been  before the Congress for well over a dec ade, in fact 16 years, I think, is what is  claimed. In any case it has been a long  time  that  this  land has been  in  the  planning process.  Congress has attempted in the past  to act on this legislation, and it was  vetoed, in fact the only wilderness bill  ever vetoed, in 1988 by the then-Presi dent Reagan.  I would suggest  to my colleagues I  think that the President did not act  correctly at that time, but, hopefully,  we will put that behind us and move  ahead now with the type of debate and  consideration that will provide for the  deliberate  consideration  and  finally  the enactment of this legislation which  is so important to the Great Sky coun try. In providing for the preservation  of wilderness, we will exercise our re sponsibility as stewards of our natural  heritage and legacy.  Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal ance of my time.  ",1994
187,,103,0.496,1167,7,Mr. HANSEN.," Madam Chairman,  I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume.  Madam Chairman, the issue of Mon tana wilderness has been considered by  this body even before I arrived here  nearly 14 years ago. As a member of  the Natural Resources Committee,  I  have participated  in numerous hear ings and markups on this issue.  Coming from a western public lands  State which  is  64  percent  federally  owned and as author of the 1984 Utah  Wilderness Act, I believe that decisions  on wilderness are best left to the mem bers of the affected State. They are the  only ones elected by those who are di rectly  affected  by  these  decisions.  Therefore, I agree with Chairman MIL LER that we should defer to the mem bers of the delegation for direction.  Unfortunately,  the  Natural  Re sources Committee and the House often  fails  to defer to  those members  that  are duly elected by constituents who  live and work in the areas proposed for  wilderness. For example, next week the  House will consider a 7 million acre  wilderness  bill  for  the  California  desert, which  is opposed by all  four  Members who represent that area.  I personally believe  the acreage  in  this bill  is  excessive.  It designates  twice as much wilderness as the profes sional  land managers at  the Forest  Service recommended in their exhaus tive rare II study. In fact, some of the  counties affected by H.R.  2473  have  voiced their opposition to this bill and  I personally believe that local support  is very important. However, I will defer  to  the gentleman  from Montana on  that matter. In turn, I hope he defers  to the four gentleman representing the  California desert when H.R. 518 comes  up next week.  I am concerned with several prece dents  in  this bill  that could become  boiler plate language for other wilder ness bills. I disagree with the Montana  ecosystem and economics study cre ated in section 9, which the Congres sional Budget Office claims will cost $8  million. Similarly, I prefer stronger re lease language to help assure that the  3 million acres  released for multiple  use is actually managed that way.  Finally, I am concerned that this bill  will affect land management decisions  and  the  local economies outside  the  State of Montana. For example, wilder ness and special management designa tions in northwest Montana will exac erbate the timber supply crisis in Or egon and other nearby States. I sup ported a  reasonable but unsuccessful  amendment by Mr. Smith of Oregon,  who represents such an affected area.  In conclusion, while  I defer  to Mr.  WILLIAMS generally on his bill affect ing his State, I have some reservations.  I will support reasonable amendments  which I believe  improve  the bill, but  keep the basic package in tact.  Madam Chairman, I reserve the bal ance of my time.  ",1994

I have been  very tortured about how I was going to  vote on this. I feel that Senator DOLE  and Senator LIEBERMAN  and  others  have made  an  extremely  important  point  through  this debate, and  that  they have moved in fact the resolution  that the majority leader is offering. I  want  to make  sure  I  understand  it  completely.  My own view  is  that, as  I believe  most have said today, that the embar go should be lifted. My further view is  that the best thing is if it is lifted by  all the nations and done  through the  United Nations. That would be my  preference. And if that does not hap pen, I believe we need to then move ex peditiously in a unilateral way.  Mr. President, it is my understanding  that is exactly what the majority lead er has said here. On page 2, on No. 2  where the majority leader says, ""The  Congress favors the termination of the  arms embargo against the Government  of Bosnia."" And further down ""If the  Security Council fails  to pass such a  resolution  the President shall""-and  you have added ""within 5 days""-""con sult with Congress regarding unilateral  termination of the arms embargo.""  It is my understanding that at that  time  either  the majority  leader, or  Senator LIEBERMAN or Senator DOLE  could in fact offer this unilateral lift ing-at that time. Am I correct in that  assumption?  ",1994

On Saturday, March 5,  1994,  the  Lady  Sandies accomplished what very  few sports  teams have been able to do. They won their  second State championship back-to-back by  defeating Conroe High School by a score of  62 to 46 in front of 7,392 fans.  The  last  two seasons  the Amarillo High  School Sandies have won  71  of  their 73  games. Coach Dale Blunt's  leadership and  dedication  is evident  in  the Sandies' highly  successful  record. Also  instrumental  to  the  success of the Sandies was the high level of  teamwork, dedication,  and  persistence  this  team possessed. The Amarillo High Sandies  became only the second Texas class 5A team  to win back-to-back basketball titles since the  University Interscholastic League began play ing five-on-five in 1979. The Sandies have en joyed  the constant support of  the Amarillo  High School student body, their parents, and  the community of fans that have turned out to  watch them play throughout the season.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to recog nize Amarillo High School's Lady Sandies, a  group of athletes that have turned their team work into a winning combination 2 years in a  row.

192,,103,-0.226,1414,7,Mr. SANGMEISTER.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  would  like  to salute an outstanding young  woman who has been honored with  the Girl  Scouts of the U.S.A. Gold Award by Trailways  Girl Scout Council, in Joliet, IL. She is Carrie  Villringer of Girl Scout Troop 230.  She is being honored on May 19, 1994 for  earning the highest achievement award in Girl  Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbol izes outstanding accomplishments in the areas  of leadership, community service, career plan ning,  and personal  development. The Girl  Scout Gold Award can be earned by girls age  14-17 or in grades 9-12.  Girl Scouts of  the U.S.A., an organization  serving over 2.6 million girls, has awarded  more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to  Senior Girl Scouts since. the  inception of the  program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl  Scout must fulfill five requirements: Earn four  interest project patches, earn the Career Ex ploration pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Lead ership Award, earn the Senior Girl Scout Chal lenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout  Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling the re quirements of  the award  is created by  the  Senior Girl Scout and  is carried out through  close cooperation between  the girl and an  adult Girl Scout volunteer.  As a member of the Trailways Girl Scout  Council, Carrie began working toward the Girl  Scout Gold Award  in November, 1993. She  completed her project in the areas of the out of-doors and  the environment. She  first at tended  a  detailed  training  hosted  by Girl  Scouts of the U.S.A. and then returned home  to develop a reforestation project/manual to be  used at a 230-acre site owned by her council.  Her project includes all aspects of tree plant ing;  selection, actual planting, and mainte nance.  The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is  a major accomplishment for Carrie, and I be lieve she should receive the public recognition  due her for this significant service to her com munity and her country.  REPEAL THE SOCIAL SECURITY  EARNINGS TEST  HON. DEAN A. GAUO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 12, 1994  ",1994
193,,103,-0.362,1427,7,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to  recognize  the accomplishments and con tributions of the Jersey City Merchants Coun cil, on the occasion of their awards luncheon,  and the installation of their newly elected offi cers. The council was organized in 1950, as a  coalition of merchants' associations represent ing all major shopping districts in the city, to  prevent  the destruction and deterioration of  the retail businesses. It has been an effective  voice for the small business owners of the city  for decades.  These merchants are the backbone of the  community, and reflect the tremendous ethnic  diversity of Jersey City. The council's new offi cers are Ms. Pat Sebron of the Greater Ber gen-Lafayette Business and Professional As sociation, Mr. Michael Y. Yun of the Central  Avenue Special Improvement District Manage ment Corporation, Mr. Arnold Friedman of the  Downtown Merchants Association, Mr. Thom as J. Moloney of the Five Corner's Business  Association, Mr. Paul E. Baker of the Hudson  Mall Merchants Association, Mr. Elliot Braha of  the Journal Square Merchants Council, Mr.  Kenneth Musico of the McGinley Square MerEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  chants Association, Mr. Ken Volk of the New port Centre Mall, and Ms. Jean Burns of the  Westside Avenue Merchants Association.  The importance of the council's work, how ever, goes beyond its advocacy for local mer chants. Preserving Jersey City's retail shop ping district assures a quality of  life and a  community  suitable  for area  residents and  their families.  The council represents more than 3,000 re tail stores and establishments in Jersey City,  and  regularly conducts meetings,  seminars,  and workshops for area merchants in order to  keep a finger on the pulse of the community,  and to share  their insights with  local elected  officials responsible for regulation and legisla tion.  In 1967, local merchants found themselves  facing a wide range of difficulties, including a  lack of municipal parking, zoning problems,  sales  tax  issues, a  lack of adequate police  presence, and  the  issue of Sunday sales.  Their commitment to the community  inspired.  them to work through these obstacles, and al though progress was  sometimes  slow,  the  same  strength  and  dedication  that  have  helped them succeed as business owners has  helped  them  find creative solutions  to  their  problems.  Twenty years  later,  the council members  voted to support the extension of Jersey City's  Urban Enterprise Zone  to  include  the  retail  streets  of Bergen  and Monticello Avenue.  Through their efforts, they were able to secure  funding through the city sales tax to be used  on projects to enhance the shopping districts,  including public  safety programs,  improved  lighting, and storefront facade repairs.  The efforts of  the members of  the Mer chants Council have been pivotal to the defeat  of a proposed city license tax to be  imposed  on  retailers,  the  repeal of a city payroll  tax,  and the exemption on clothing and other ne cessities  from State sales  taxes.  In addition,  the merchants have been active working  to  preserve Sunday as a day for family activities  by promoting prohibitions on Sunday sales.  Mr. Speaker,  the Jersey City Merchants  Council is a wonderful example of how urban  communities can come  together  to preserve  their neighborhoods  through cooperation be tween  retailers,  residents, and  local govern ment.  I commend  them to the  retail commu nities of other American cities as an excellent  model  for  local  initiative, and ask my col leagues to join me in recognizing their accom plishments.

195,,103,0.242,1518,7,Mr. BATEMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  1ring to  the attention of my colleagues in the  House of Representatives an article  recently  published in the Newport News Daily Press by  Gen. Frederick M. Franks, Jr., commander in  chief, U.S. Army  training and doctrine com mand. General Franks has written what  I be lieve  to be a  truly moving  testament  to  the  quality of our men and women who serve  in  the Armed Forces and  the way in which they  unfailingly attain new heights  in courage and  dedication at times of greatest adversity. From  the forests of the Ardennes to the mountains  of Korea, from  the jungles of Vietnam  to  the  deserts of Iraq and Somalia, America's fighting  men have continuously proven  their willing ness  to sacrifice  themselves  for  their  fellow  soldiers and  for  their country. Perhaps no where is this spirit of sacrifice and dedication  more prevalent than among those who return  from the battlefield permanently disabled, and  Frederick Franks belongs in the group, having  lost a leg in Vietnam. It is that category of vet eran and military retiree  that  is  the  focus of  General  Franks'  article  and  I  highly  rec ommend my colleagues read it.  HEROES ON THE BA 'ITLEFIELD OR THE SKI  SLOPES  (By Frederick M. Franks Jr.)  We do not have to look up heroes in his tory books. They are all around us every  day. American heroes. They are Americans  from all across America who look like Amer ica. They are  soldiers and  their  families.  They are volunteers-reaching out to serve  when needed with a hand to help and a heart  to care.  I  recently went  to Fort Bragg, N.C.,  to  visit with fellow soldiers injured in the trag ic accident March 23 at Pope Air Force Base.  President Clinton, Secretary of  the Army  Togo West and Chief of Staff of the Army,  Gen. Gordon Sullivan had all previously vis ited our soldiers.  Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, XVIII Airborne  Corps commander, took me for a brief visit  to the accident site before going to the hos pital. It was a battlefield scene. And as I lis tened to accounts of the accident I visualized  all  the battlefield behavior I have seen of  American soldiers in combat: soldiers help ing each other-medics, volunteers and lead ers moving swiftly to the scene.  I have seen combat and I have been among  heroism on  the battlefield  in  two wars  in  Vietnam and Iraq. I also have seen brave sol dier-heroes  in hospitals  from Vietnam  to  Valley Forge and Saudi Arabia  to Walter  Reed. Now  there,  listening,  I  saw  it all  again-American soldiers rising to a moment  that they did not choose.  Later visiting with injured soldiers in the  hospital, I was struck with their courage and  selflessness. They asked about  their fellow  soldiers. They talked about getting back to  duty. They talked about those who had died  or others hurt worse than they. They talked  about anything but themselves.  They were hurt and down but already on  the way back. They were  inspiring  to be  with.  They  are  your  soldiers-America's  Army. They are sons and daughters, hus bands and wives, brothers and sisters. Amer ican soldiers.  That same day I went  to Crested Butte,  Colo., for the opening ceremonies of the Na tional Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clin ic. This is a week sponsored by the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs and  the Disabled  American Veterans  (DAV) with significant  corporate assistance.  It was started by Sandy Trombetta, clinic  organizer and director, eight years ago when  he  reached out  to a disabled veteran and  began a dream. This year his dream included  more than 240 veterans who were amputees,  visually impaired or had spinal cord injuries.  They assembled at Crested Butte to receive  rehabilitation through skiing, snowmobiling,  swimming and other vigorous sports. Two  veterans were  from  our VA Hospital  in  Hampton  and  two  soldier-amputees were  from actions last fall in Somalia.  But there was more there than athletics.  There were Americans reaching out to each  other:  veterans,  volunteers  from Crested  Butte and across America, craftsmen config uring prosthetic ski devices on-the-spot out  of the back of a truck, doctors, prosthetists,  Sandy Trombetta, and Bruce Nitsche and  Art Wilson from  the National Headquarters  of the DA V pulling it all  together. Ameri cans  from our wars and other operations  were  there: World War II, Korea, Vietnam,  Desert Storm and Somalia. These are Amer ican veterans who get a reminder every day  as  they get  in  their wheelchair, strap on  their prosthesis, or reach for their cane-it  never goes away.  Who are they? They are the same Ameri cans I saw at Fort Bragg and other places in  the past who did what their country asked.  And they are supported by other Americans  who did not go away and who did not forget,  Americans who  long after  the battles  re main,  remember and  then continue  their  commitment of reaching out to help veter ans help  themselves. Communication with out words. All of it-selfless service.  After speaking by phone to Maj. Gen. Mike  Steele, 82d Airborne Division  commander,  who had just finished visiting his soldiers at  Brooke Army Hospital  in  San Antonio,  Texas, I went to Brooke Army Hospital on  my way back  from Colorado and was per mitted to visit the wards with most of the  very  seriously burned  soldiers  from Fort  Bragg. I was escorted by Col. (Dr.) Basil A.  Pruitt, commander and director of the U.S.  Army Institute of Surgical Research  (U.S.  Army Burn Center), and Brig. Gen. Mike  Canavan, assistant division commander of  the 82d Airborne Division. I was met there by  Col. Elizabeth Greenfield, chief nurse.  I also was able to talk with some soldier families in a splendid family assistance cen ter staffed mostly with volunteers and set up  at Fort Sam Houston. I have seen heroic actions on the battlefield and I have personally  felt the pain of combat as well as the phys ical and emotional battles on the long road  back. But I was not ready for the heroism I  saw again in Texas.  Every soldier I visited who could talk said  to me either ""hooah,"" ""airborne"" or 'an the  way."" Now  that is soldier talk for a  lot of  things, but mainly it is about soldiers fight ing  through  enormous pain  and grabbing  onto the verbal symbols of the toughness and  commitment to each other that bind them  together and make them so great in service  to America. They are the best of America.  They are the best we have. Selfless and cou rageous.  I spoke to each soldier, but more commu nication passed between us than words. They  said more to me about courage, selfless serv ice and trust than I could ever describe.  They are American soldiers, being cared  for by other soldiers and airmen and soldier doctors-the best caring for the best. Reach ing out to each other, they are the strength  of America. They trust each other. There is  something noble, good and right about such  American soldiers. I was honored  to be  in  their presence.  ""Don't worry, general, we  trust you,"" a  soldier  in VII Corps' 3d Armored Division  said to me before we attacked into Iraq in  1991. U.S. Army Rangers  in Mogadishu on  Oct. 3, 1993, reached back for their fellow sol diers and fought all night protecting each  other. And in each of these visits I heard it  again, ""I'll be OK. How's so and so? I'm not  as bad as.  . . . I'll be back  jumping  in no  time. Hooah; airborne."" And earlier, ""I'd do  it again even though I lost an arm and a leg  if none of my soldiers were hurt.""  Heroes. All around us. They are not from  some other planet or strangers from a his tory book.  Where do  they come from? How do we get  such people?  They come from America and they are us.  They reach out to each other and reach out  to serve a  cause greater  than  themselves.  They were hurt badly but were thinking of  what they had-not what they did not have and what to make of that.  I count myself  lucky  to be among such  Americans,  to walk in their ranks, to both  serve  them and be entrusted to  lead  them.  Look around you and find the best in Amer ica. It's all around us every day. We notice it  during  tough  times.  It was  especially all  around me on these three powerful days.  Please  include a prayer for  these heroic  Americans still  in hospitals or recovering,  and for  their families and  the  families of  those who died.  THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN SCIENCE  HON. ANNA G.

This is the third in a series of spe cial orders  I will give  this week  to  bring attention  to  this event.  I will  continue this evening by reading to the  membership, excerpts from  the book,  ""Forgotten  Holocaust:  The  Poles  Under German Occupation, 1939-1944,""  by Richard Lucas.  August  5.-The German  counterattack  began with  a  massive  assault  by  the  Luftwaffe, which dropped incendiary bombs.  Between ground  and air action,  houses  were systematically leveled on both sides of  the street, barricades were destroyed, and  the entire area became an inferno.  Kaminski's unit, which began its assault  at a more  leisurely 9:30 a.m. un August 5,  only advanced 300 yards. One reason for the  slow progress of its attack stemmed from  stubborn Polish defenders who were hope lessly outmanned and outarmed. Another  reason, however, was the degeneration of the  Kaminski  counterattack  into an orgy of  murdering,  looting and  raping-converting  men into a mob of marauders more akin to  Attila's hordes than to soldiers of a modern  disciplined army.  Most of the responsibility for the crimes in  Warsaw has been  leveled against the  infa mous Dirlewanger Brigade and the Russians  in Kaminski's Brigade. Though this was true  to a  large extent, there were also regular,  SS, and police formations who were involved  in the degraded activities of these early Au gust days.  Oskar Dirlewanger was one of those degen erates who, in saner days, would have been  court-martialed out of  the German army.  Born in Wuerzberg in 1895, he served in the  German army in World War I, after which he  went on to earn a doctorate in economics.  Though intelligent, he was a  liar, an alco holic and a pervert who molested children.  Convicted of a sexual assault upon a minor  in 1935, he spent two years in prison. When  released, he was arrested again on the same  charge, but thanks to his mentor, Gottlob  Berger, an SS general, he was released and  served with the Condor Legion in Spain. In  July 1940, he took over a unit of game poach ers. Later,  the group swelled  to battalion  strength and was sent to fight Polish par tisans  as  the  SS  Special  battalion  Dirlewanger. He was a sadist who treated his  own men as brutally as he treated the Poles.  Beating them with clubs  to maintain dis cipline was not uncommon. He even casually  shot men he did not like. Little wonder that  many of his soldiers deserted to the Russians  when they had a chance. After 1942, hardened  criminals were drafted into his unit, which  gave  and  expected  no  quarter  from  the  enemy.  Another criminal, Mieczystaw Kaminski,  commanded an SS brigade bearing his name,  though he dubbed it the ""Russian Popular  Army of Liberation."" He was brought up a  Russian, although his father was Polish and  his mother German. Kaminski spent years in  a Soviet labor camp and like most of them  lived and worked in horrible conditions. He  vowed never to return to one again. For a  time, Soviet authorities forced him to live in  exile  in Lokot, near Briansk. Being a  re sourceful  fellow, he became mayor of the  city, and from that point on his career sky rocketed.  In return for providing the Nazis with food  requisitions  and maintaining  the  area  against the Soviet partisans, Kaminski es tablished a virtual dictatorship over Lokot.  The clever Kaminski cultivated his own  popularity by pandering to the peoples' anti Soviet feeling, allowing his soldiers freedom  to loot and granting rapid promotion to any one he liked.  The number of non-German operating in  the SS and police units was very large: Byel orussian and Ukrainians, for example, con tinued more than fifty percent of some of  them.  The Kaminski and Dirlewanger brigades  have the dubious distinction of perpetuating  the worst crimes of any units in Warsaw.  What transpired in Wola and Ochota, the  western and southwestern districts of War saw, during the early days of August must be  considered one of the most horrendous trage dies  in a  tragedy-filled war. On August 5  alone, 10,000 civilians were murdered.  The tragedy for Wola began in the morning  of August 4, when Alexandra Kreczkiewicz  and  500  of her  neighbors  of Gorszewska  Street were ordered to evacuate their apart ments. Children and women cried. Several  people were shot at the exit of the building.  It was like the Jewish ghetto all over again.  The Germans drove Kreczkiewicz and her  friends to a potato field where everyone was  told to lie down to lessen the chance for es cape. A few moments later the group was  told to get up, and it was driven to a nearby  bridge. ""There was no doubt about our fate,""  Kreczkiewicz related.  When one woman asked where they were  being taken,  the grim answer came, ""Ger man women and children are perishing by  your fault;  therefore, all of you must per ish."" The SS men divided  the people  into  ranks and one contingent of 70 people was  separated  and ordered  to  go  behind  the  bridge.  The  remaining  group,  including  Kreczkiewicz, was ordered against the wall  between the barbed wire. Soon shots rang  out. People died. ""At a distance of five me ters in front of us,"" she said, ""one of the  henchmen, very quietly loaded his machine  gun; another was preparing his camera; they  wanted to prolong the execution ... I fell  down wounded and lost consciousness.""  When  she  recovered  her  senses,  Kreczkiewicz  feigned death. The Germans  left a guard over  the corpses while  they  burned  the  houses  in  the  neighborhood.  Scorched by the heat and almost suffocated  by the smoke, she thought of how to get out  of the hell in which she found herself. She  crawled behind a  basket of potatoes and  inched her way  forward when  suddenly a  cloud of smoke obscured the guard's vision of  the area. She quickly got up and ran to a cel lar of a house that was on fire. She met a few  wounded people who were fortunate enough  to have escaped from the pile of corpses. De spite  the heat and smoke,  the determined  group of survivors tunneled their way to a  nearby house untouched by fire. They were  safe.    The slaughter continued the next day in  Wola. Between 11:00 AM and noon, the Ger mans ordered everyone out of building No. 18  Dzialdowska Street. A pregnant woman with  three children was one of the last to leave  the cellar where she had been hiding, hoping  to spare herself and her family. The Germans  escorted the inhabitants of the house to the  Ursus factory on  the corner of the Wolska  and Skierniewicka streets. There, in the fac tory yard, mass executions took place. The  ",1994
199,House,103,0.391,287,13,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Speaker, first  of all, I thank the gentleman for yield ing. I would like to personally thank  the gentleman  from Oklahoma  [Mr.  IsTOOK] for the personal effort that he  has put  into  this,  sitting  for 3-plus  hours through a hearing, and not send ing a staffer to do it, to be  there to  hear firsthand what the judge had to  say.  This  issue  started with  us  some  months ago  in our committee when  there was at least a sense that maybe  what we were being told was not to tally accurate. Then there were anum ber of reports  that appeared  in  the  press that would indicate to the oppo site of what we had been told, knowing  that sometimes the press does not al ways get it exactly right, very reluc tant to push forward with anything as  serious as a letter that has been sent to  the Attorney General.  But  in  light of  the court hearing,  which the gentleman sat through, the  fact that in that document, and as the  gentleman just read from our hearing  testimony in our subcommittee, a di rect quote from Ms. Thomasson, that  the working group is made up entirely  of Federal employees,  this was in re sponse to a letter. So it was not off the  cuff.  We had asked, just backing up a bit,  asked Ms. Thomasson if she would de scribe for us the makeup of this work ing group, and she said first of all, I  will consult with the White House with  regard  to your questions about  the  health care task force and we will get  back to you with some type of an an swer.  What the gentleman from Oklahoma  [Mr. ISTOOK]  just read was her answer,  where, as he pointed out, the group was  entirely made up of Federal employees.  Yet,  the  judge has a  list, I believe  some 26 pages, of people who are not  Federal employees, who are tied to all  kinds of special-interest groups.  For example, here is chief, medical  staff, of a particular hospital. Here is a  University  of Pittsburgh Center  for  Medical  Ethics. Howard University.  You can go through here and pick out  about anything you want. The Heller  School, a portion of Brandeis Univer sity. The National Governors' Associa tion.  These  are not Federal  employees.  These are special-interest-group people  who have  their fingerprints all over  this so-called piece of health care legis lation that we will be asked to vote on  here, as we are being held here so we  can get enough votes to do it.  So, in essence, I really appreciate the  efforts of  the gentleman from Okla homa [Mr. Is TOOK]  in coming up with  factual information, into just press re ports, not just hearsay, but black and  white comments.  Mr. Speaker, I would again like to  thank Mr. ISTOOK for yielding. I have  another meeting I have to attend, but  I think it is critically important that  honesty and integrity be a part of this  whole operation. If there is anything in  this  country  that  people  are  upset  with, it is the perception, and, unfortu nately, sometimes backed by reality,  of the dishonesty of people in govern ment. When  highly  placed  officials  come before a congressional committee  and tell us something that is not true,  and it has been verified through their  own statements and through legal doc uments, rather than just hearsay, then  we,  I  think, have an obligation, an  oversight obligation on behalf of the  American people who elected us, to get  to the bottom of the issue.  So, again,  I really compliment Mr.  ISTOOK for the hours that he has put in  in making sure that we do have all the  legal documents, that we do have the  testimony, and we do have  the com parisons made, and also members of  both of our staffs who worked very  hard making sure  that  the gun was  loaded. You do not want to pull  the  trigger on a blank at this point, under scoring  that we are basically asking  the Attorney General to appoint a spe cial counsel because of this obvious re lationship with  the President, which  that would happen in any administra tion.  Again, thank you for yielding.  ",1994
200,House,103,0.492,287,13,Mr. ISTOOK.," Thank you, Mr. LIGHT FOOT.  Reclaiming my  time,  you  know,  when we mention the deceit that has  been practiced in this case, I think it is  important to notice what is going on in  this  court  case  regarding  Ira  Magaziner,  the special advisor  to  the  President, who was widely considered  to  be  the architect  of  the Clinton  health care plan.  Now, Mr. Magaziner filed an affidavit  with the court last March,  in March  1993. One  of  the  statements  in Mr.  Magaziner's affidavit, reading from it,  page 4, paragraph 11, he told the court;  ""Only Federal Government employees  serve as members of the interdepartmental working  groups,"" which  of  course is directly contradicted now by  the knowledge that over 300 non-Fed eral Government employees were  in volved, which means  that  all  the  records,  under  the  law, have  to be  opened.  Now,  is this hearing Monday, Judge  Lambert,  talking  about  Mr.  Magaziner's conduct and the fact that  the  plaintiffs  have  asked  that Mr.  Magaziner be cited for being in con tempt of court, the  judge twice from  the bench  commented  in  regard  to  what Mr. Magaziner told the court in  1993, in March, said, ""It is not true."" It  is not true. That in order to retain the  secrecy that is so precious to the White  House, that is so essential to this ad ministration, there were willing to let  the court be told something that was  not true. And he asked the attorneys  for the Justice Department Monday, he  said, that has been 15 months ago. Why  didn't you ever file a correction,  in stead of misleading the court for over a  year? And the attorneys for the Justice  Department had no good reason. a:~n . .-.. '  good explanation.  0 1610  So Mr. Magaziner, as part of his f:ep  tember 12  trial, may be held  in con tempt of court for lying to a U.S. dis trict judge, Royce Lambert. And as the  plaintiffs in this lawsuit have said L-,  their papers filed with the court,  The defendant, Ira M.agaziner, made false  statements and misled  this court and the  plaintiffs when he testified under penalty of  perjury on March 3rd, 1993  that the Inter departmental working group of the Presi dent's task force on national health care re form and its cluster groups, working groups  and subgroups, were composed only of full time employees and special government em ployees of the Federal Government.  Now, for 15 months that has been the  heart and soul of this case. That has  been what has been in contention and  what has dragged it on, dragged it up  to an appellate court and back down,  what has kept these documents, and I  understand that there are 100 boxes of  documents that are being held by the  White House in secrecy, all because the  Judge was told that all the people in volved were Federal  employees,  and  thus there was an exemption to the dis closure laws.  Now, at the hearing Monday, the at torney  for  the  Justice Department  said, ""Well, judge, we are not pushing  that point anymore."" The judge asked  him, ""Well, are you withdrawing your  contention?"" ""Well, we are just saying  it does not matter anymore.""  There were  43  subdivisions,  called  working groups, with this health care  task force. And do you know what the  Justice Department has  said  in  its  briefs to the court, they said, well, we  are sure that 3 of them anyway, that is  3 out of 43, three of them were entirely  Federal employees. And yesterday, in  open court, the Justice Department at torneys made a stipulation to the judge  ",1994
201,,103,0.492,326,13,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker,  those of us  who live in the 22d Congressional District can  boast of living in one of the most historical re gions of the country.  In so many cases, the old churches in the  district,  along with  their  spiritual  functions,  often serve as virtual museums of area  lore,  with  their  registries and  records of baptisms  and marriages of historical figures, and growth  patterns which reflect and parallel the growth  of the area.  One such church,  in  fact one of the  fore most examples,  is the First Baptist Church of  South Glens  Falls,  an  Independent  Fun damental Church affiliated with  the Conserv ative Baptist Association, which  is celebrating  its 200th anniversary this year.  This church can  trace  its  lineage to 1794,  when it was known as the First Baptist Church  of Northumberland.  In  1831,  it became  the  Moreau Baptist Church. Early meetings were  held in homes until 1837, and after that in the  Borrows Schoolhouse. Property on the corner  of Main and Third Streets was donated by Ju lius Rice  in 1859. The church built on  this  property opened  in 1862. Finally,  the name  was  changed  to  its  present  First  Baptist  Church of South Glens Falls  in 1875, and a  parsonage was built in 1895.  The church's most noteworthy growth period  came during the ministry of Rev. Nevin Korb,  who came to South Glens Falls with his family  in 1948. A major factor in this growth was the  use of  radio broadcasts. While an addition  was being built in 1954, Sunday School class es and worship  services were held  in  the  South Glens Falls Town Hall building.  By 1967, the church could boast of a new  building and parsonage.  Its present pastor,  Rev. Gary C. Stefanski and his family arrived  in July, 1993.    Throughout its long history, this church, like  so many others  in  the area, has been  the  focus of community life and a bastion of the  best virtues our society has to offer.  During the weekend of August 5 to 7,  the  First Baptist Church of South Glens Falls will  celebrate those glorious two centuries. Please  join me in expressing congratulations and best  wishes as the church moves into its third cen tury.  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM A. HICKEY  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 27, 1994  ",1994
202,,103,-0.379,326,13,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute to a very special person, William  (Bill) A. Hickey, on  the occasion of his 80th  birthday. Bill Hickey  is a man of uncommon  talent and uncommon modesty-a true patriot,  family man, and gentleman.  Born at home in Washington, DC on August  1, 1914, near Capitol Hill on Seventh Street in  the northeast section, Bill attended elementary  schools-the First Pierce, named after Presi dent Franklin Pierce, also  the old Franklin  School in Northwest Washington. As a young  boy, he served  the Times-Herald newspaper  to earn a  few dollars  for pocket money. Bill  graduated  from Eastern High School  in  the  June class of 1934. The working world came  next-the  old  Palace  Laundry,  Judd  and  Detweiller printing plant, and luckily a good job  at  the Potomac Electric Power Co.  [PePCo]  where he was employed  for 40 years,  from  1937-77.  Bill served in the U.S. Navy during a period  in World War  II as an electrician's mate as signed to the amphibious forces, with service  in the Asiatic-Pacific area. Returning home he  resumed his duties at PePCo as a field meter  tester and found great pleasure in meeting the  American  public-a  great  experience.  Bill  loves people. He was married in June of 1937,  a happy marriage with his wife Ruth, which  lasted for 53 years until her passing in 1990.  The father of five grown children, three daugh ters and  two sons, and six grandchildren, he  is a very dedicated family man. Now retired,  he participates in veteran, patriotic, civic, and  political affairs as his hobby.  Since he  is also an avid sports fan, espe cially of the Washington Redskins, he contin ues to usher at his young age. Beginning his  career with  the Redskins  in 1957 at the old  Griffith Stadium  in Washington, DC, he has  now been employed by  the  team owners for  37 years. He presently works, as he has  for  the last 20 years, in Jack Kent Cooke's mez zanine box at  the RFK Stadium, where he  loves greeting and talking to all the dignitaries  attending the games, including Senators, Con gressmen, and former sports greats.

203,House,103,-0.473,352,13,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 2 minutes, and I take this time  to explain why the National Associa tion of Realtors supports this legisla tion  and would  oppose  the  Oxley  amendment.  The real tors support this bill and the  disclosure  to  the  respective  buyer  about the radon problem, simply just  telling them about the radon problem  and that tests could be  taken should  they so desire, because it is the right  thing to do, it is the responsible thing  to do, because they are aware that it is  a national public health problem and it  makes good business sense for them be cause they are caught in a dilemma. If  the seller tells the realtor not to dis close some information, the realtor has  to decide either to not disclose that in formation in order to please the seller  whom  that  realtor  is  representing,  most likely, or to disclose the informa tion anyway and then anger the seller.  But they fear that they will be  later  sued by someone for not disclosing the  information about radon.  We went over this with the National  Association  of Real tors. Maybe  in  Ohio, if they had not thought about the  issue and heard  the arguments,  they  were puzzled by it, but the fact of the  matter was that the National Associa tion of Realtors in looking at this issue  decided to go along with the same pro vision that we have under Federal law  today requiring the disclosure of infor mation about lead. That is under Fed eral law today, and the lead problem,  which is a serious problem, especially  for children, is one that the consumer  would be informed about. The realtors  supported it, and everybody supported  it. This House adopted it, and it is now  law.  The information would be given out  in tests, if the buyer so desired,  that  could be taken before the transaction  occurred. The test for radon,  just for  people's information, comes to around  test. It is a very simple one and  an inexpensive one. The mitigation is  not that expensive either. But the im portant point is to get the information  to the public.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he  may consume  to  the gentleman from  Washington [Mr. SWIFT], the chairman  of the subcommittee of the-Committee  on Energy and Commerce that also has  jurisdiction over this issue.  ",1994
204,House,103,-0.43,352,13,Mr. SWIFT.," Mr. Chairman,  thank  the gentleman for yielding this time to  me.  $30 a  I  Mr. Chairman, I would like to under line the point that the gentleman has  just made with regard to the fact that  we are not breaking any new ground  here in terms of asking at the Federal  level that there be certain disclosures.  I  suppose  that reasonable people can  disagree as to what is a Federal respon sibility or a State responsibility, but  the fact  is that the Congress has al ready said it is a Federal responsibil ity. We have done that in legislation  passed by  this Congress  in  the past.  This merely adds a radioactive gas to  the list of things that have to be dis closed.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2448,  the Radon  Awareness and Disclosure Act of 1994 is  a fair, effective, and carefully crafted  piece of legislation with broad support  from consumer groups, environmental  groups,  public  health  organizations,  State and local government organiza tions, and business organizations in the  housing and real estate markets. This  bill attacks the problem of radon expo sure  in a  systematic way. First,  the  bill places special emphasis on  those  areas of the country in which we know  there is a higher potential for elevated  indoor  radon  levels by  targeting  the  model construction standards to those  areas. Second, to address the fact that  as few as 10 percent of private homes in  America have been  tested for  radon,  the bill ties disclosure and information  dispersal  requirements  to real estate  transactions-an  especially  effective  time to encourage testing. Third,  the  bill establishes a performance program  for radon products and services, so that  consumers may make safer, more  in formed choices.  This bill is the result of an extensive  process of negotiation to meet the con cerns of interested parties. It is impor tant for Members  to understand that  the bill we consider today has changed  significantly  from  the bill  as  intro duced.  The bill as  introduced contained a  provision  that some  interpreted as a  mandatory radon test during real es tate transactions. The bill we consider  today does not require testing. Rather,  it requires the seller or lessor of a vul nerable premises  to  disclose  to  the  buyer  or  lessee  the  results  of any  known radon testing and the presence  of any known  radon mitigation sys tems. The seller or lessor must addi tionally  include  in  the  contract  a  radon warning statement, and give the  buyer or  lessee a  radon  information  pamphlet.  The bill as introduced provided for  mandatory  radon  resistant construc tion in high radon areas. That section  has  been  changed;  the  construction  standards are voluntary  in  this bill.  Sellers of new vulnerable premises in  high radon areas must disclose to the  buyer whether the premises has been or  will be constructed in compliance with  EPA model  standards. This  requirement drops for subsequent sales after  the premises has been occupied.  Finally, concern was expressed that  the penalties provisions of the bill were  too  severe.  This  section was  also  amended and the penalties greatly re duced. The  bill  no  longer  contains  criminal penal ties, nor does it provide  for citizen suits against private parties  for violations.  The Environmental Protection Agen cy has determined that radon is second  only to smoking as the leading cause of  lung cancer in this country. Passage of  this effective legislation is much need ed to address this serious health haz ard.  I urge my colleagues to vote  in  favor of passage.  0  1320  I  ",1994
205,House,103,0.382,352,13,Mr. OXLEY.," Madam Chairman,  yield such time as he may consume to  the  gentleman  from California  [Mr.  MOORHEAD], the ranking member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.  ",1994
206,House,103,0.465,352,13,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Madam Chairman,  I rise in opposition to certain portions  of this bill.  Before  I describe my concerns with  this bill, I want to commend the work  of Mr. MARKEY, Mr. WAXMAN, Mr.  SWIFT, and Chairman DINGELL in mov ing  this  legislation  to  reauthorize  EPA's  indoor  radon  program. While  there is still one important area of dis agreement on the bill, I think it is im portant  to  point out  that we  have  worked closely with our colleagues on  the Energy and Commerce Committee  to make a number of improvements. I  especially want to recognize my Repub lican colleagues, Mr. BLILEY and Mr.  OXLEY,  the  ranking members of  the  subcommittees  of  jurisdiction,  for  their efforts  to  improve  this  legisla tion.  To begin with, let me say that I do  not oppose reauthorization of EPA's in door radon programs. I agree that EPA  should be  looking at whether  radon  presents serious health risks. I under stand that EPA has provided signifi cant funding for the National Research  Council to study whether exposure to  low levels of radon causes lung cancer.  I  think  this  is  important work  that  should continue.  My concern with this legislation is  with the provision on real estate trans actions. That section says that before  anyone can sell a house located any where in the United States, the seller  must provide  the buyer with several  different  kinds  of  information  on  radon.  As a southern Californian, I have sev eral problems with this part of the bill.  First, California already has a law that  requires  sellers  to  disclose  environ mental hazards  to buyers,  including  radon.  Second, radon is not a big problem in  California. We  have  other  problems  like floods and fires and earthquakes. I  do  not  think  that my  constituents  ",1994
207,House,103,-0.457,404,13,Ms. FURSE.," Mr. Speaker, t took out  this special order tonight to return to  the health care debate and to return it  back  to  the American people. There  really is only one special  interest in  this debate, and  that should be  the  health  of Americans. But  unfortu nately, a lot of other special interests  have gotten involved.  Special  interests are  spending mil lions of dollars to try to move the de bate away from what I believe is the  fundamental question, and that is what  health care system can we design that  meets the needs of the American peo ple? Not what special interests can we  keep in play, but how can we develop a  health care system that actually meets  our needs?  Lately, seemingly everyone has a fi nancial stake, in the billions, and their  money is being used  to sway the de bate. Here in Congress, as we work on  health care reform, our eyes must be  on the needs of families and children.  Unless we keep our eyes on this goal,  we will lose an opportunity to establish  for all Americans what they need, and  that  is  a  system  that works,  that  makes sense, one that provides univer sal coverage so we end cost-shifting.  I would like to say that universal ac cess, which my colleagues spoke about,  everyone, I believe, has access to every  BMW dealer in the country but they do  not have the opportunity to have the  money to buy the car that they have  access to.  What we need is a health care system  that says you have access and you have  the opportunity to use it.  So, universal coverage  is very dif ferent from universal access.  What I would like to do  in this spe cial  order with other  colleagues  of  mine  is  let everyone  in  this House  know and let everyone in the country  know  that we  really are willing and  ready and able to vote for real health  care reform.  Now, I  thought about how could we  say what is real health care reform? We  have heard so many 30-second spots,  heard people taking out, hiring actors  to tell us what is or is not health care  reform.  So I  thought,  instead of looking at  those emotional 30-second sound bites,  I would look at some statistics because  I am a believer that in fact statistics  can give us a good idea.  So I  thought it might be useful  to  look at statistics of other nations on  health care and really what I want to  say on health is there are certain sta tistics that everyone agrees show the  health picture of a  country. One of  them is infant mortality and the other  is  longevity of women and men  in a  culture, in a country.  I thought I would look and compare  with our northern neighbor because  that country, Canada,  is very similar  to us in a lot of our history and our ge ography-except that Canada has uni versal coverage and we do not.  So  I  thought I would  look at how  much do we spend per capita and how  much does Canada spend per capita on  health care?  In the United States we spend $2,867  per capita. Canada  spends $1,915.  So  quite a lot less that Canada spends.  Now, you would imagine that if you  spent less, you were going to get worse  health statistics. In fact,  that is not  what I found. What I found was that in  Canada the life expectancy of men is 74  years and in the United States it is 71  years.  So you  live  you do here.  Women is even more so: 80 years in  Canada and 78.9 years  in  the United  States, that women live.  1950  So then I thought, well, I would look  at the statistics around infant mortal ity because one of the things we know  is  that,  if our children survive  their  first  year,  that  is  a  sign  that our  health care is good, we have given good  infant care, we have given prenatal  care. So, I looked at, remembering that  we spent much more in this country  per capita, I looked at this comparison.  In Canada the infant mortality rate is  6.28. That is 6.28 per 1,000 live births. In  the United States it is 9.22. Far worse,  9.22 children in the United States die in  that first year per 1,000 births com pared to 6.28 in Canada.  in Canada  0  longer  than  What was  the difference? The dif ference was that Canadians have uni versal access  to health care. So, cer tainly I believe that, if we were spend ing as much as we are now, we should  have better statistics, and I think that  that is part of the facts, rather than  the special interests, that I would like  to have us talk about tonight.  I would Hke to yield time to my col league, the gentlewoman from Califor nia [Ms. WooLSEY]  to talk about some  of the issues that she has investigated  and found out about this health care  versus special interests.

208,House,103,-0.556,404,13,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  glad to have the opportunity to speak  about my special interests, and my spe cial interest is the people of the Sixth  District  of  California, Marin  and  Sonoma Counties. These are the people  that hired me to come to Washington  to work for  them, and  these are  the  people that I know want health care re form and want a health care  reform  plan in this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, health care reform is of  the utmost importance to the people I  represent in Marin and Sonoma Coun ties. So, Mr. Speaker, I have been hold ing town meetings on health care all  across my district,  and hundreds of  people have attended. I have also re ceived thousands of letters and phone  calls about health care reform from the  people who are my special  interests,  the people I work for in the Sixth Con gressional District.  The residents of Sonoma and Marin  have made  it clear  to me  that  they  want guaranteed health care that can  never be  taken away. They want a  health care reform plan that covers all  Americans, regardless of employment,  income, or marital status. They want a  comprehensive benefit package, includ ing a  full range of reproductive bene fits. Another thing that is very impor tant to people  in Sonoma and Marin  Counties is the right  to choose  their  health care providers, including alter native providers. Finally,  they know  that any health care reform plan must  be affordable, and must be accountable  to the public.  Of all of the health care reform pro posals currently under consideration,  only  one  accomplishes  all  of  these  goals. And that is H.R. 1200, the Amer ican Health Security Act-the single payer plan. I am a cosponsor with my  colleague,  the gentlewoman from Or egon [Ms. FURSE] of the single payer  plan because it will give the people in  Marin  and Sonoma everything  they  want  in health care systems, and it  saves money as well. The Congressional  Budget Office has determined  that a  national single payer plan would  re duce spending on health care by $114  billion annually by the year 2004.

210,Senate,103,0.287,495,13,Mr. COCHRAN.," I  for yielding.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD a  letter from  the GAO addressed to me  and the Senator from New Mexico [Mr.  BINGAMAN], on an evaluation of the for mula alternatives before  the Senate  now.  thank the Senator  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  GENERAL  ACCOUNTING  OFFICE,  HEALTH,  EDUCATION  AND HUMAN  SERVICES DIVISION,  Washington, DC, June 7, 1994.  B-257503  Hon. THAD COCHRAN,  U.S. Senate.  Hon. JEFF BINGAMAN,  U.S. Senate.  The Senate is considering a new formula  for distributing  federal assistance  for  the  educationally disadvantaged under title I of  the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act amendments of 1994. The new formula,  described in Senate bill S. 1513, would dis tribute federal aid for the educationally dis advantaged on the basis of four factors. In  response to your request, this letter provides  our views of these four factors in light of the  program's objective to target funds to chil dren with the greatest need.  Under S.  1513,  funds would be allocated  under one formula, which contains four fac tors:  The first  is a weighted measure of poor  children that serves as a proxy for the num ber of educationally disadvantaged children.  The weighting scheme provides a higher per  child allocation to school districts in coun ties with high poverty rates and high num bers of children in poverty.  The second is a state average per pupil ex penditure factor, a measure of total state  and local spending on education per pupil,  that serves as a proxy for state costs of pro viding chapter 1  services.l Under current  law, this factor cannot exceed 120 percent or  fall below 80 percent of the U.S. average.  Under S. 1513,  this factor would range be tween 115 and 85 percent of the average per  pupil expenditure in the United States.  The third is an effort bonus based on state  per pupil spending expressed as a percentage  of state income, which  is a proxy for  the  level of ""effort"" the state makes in funding  elementary and secondary education in the  state. However,  this factor must range be tween 95 and 105 percent of the nation's aver age effort, rewarding those states with the  greatest effort with a bonus in their chapter  1 per pupil funding.  Fourth, an equity bonus generally based on  the coefficient of variation in per pupil edu cation spending in the state2  serves to re ward states that have low disparities in per  pupil spending in the state; states with great  disparities will  be  penalized. This  factor  must also range between 95 and 105 percent;  states with the lowest disparities are weight ed 105 percent, giving them a bonus in their  chapter 1 per pupil funding.  In summary, while the goals of S. 1513 are  laudable, the new grant allocation formula  may not be appropriately designed  to  in crease targeting to high poverty areas and to  reward states that reduce inequities in per  pupil spending. An unintended consequence  of adopting  the new  formula may be  to  produce less-rather than more-targeting to  educationally disadvantaged children.  EXTRA WEIGHTING FOR AREAS WITH HIGH  POVERTY LEVELS COULD BE INCREASED  The bill's proposed formula provides extra  weighting, which results in somewhat higher  funding per child, to target additional funds  to serve children  in areas with high con centrations of poverty. In a 1992 report, GAO  recommended that counts of children receive  Footnotes at end of letter.  greater weight in high poverty areas to bet ter reflect the greater number of education ally disadvantaged children in these areas.3  However, the weighting scheme adopted inS.  1513 may not provide high enough weight to  sufficiently target dollars to counties with  high  concentrations  of educationally dis advantaged children. For example, the need  for chapter 1 funding in high poverty coun ties may be as high as 150 percent of the need  in low poverty counties, but the weighting  scheme in S. 1513  is insufficient to provide  allocations that will compensate for this 150  percent difference in :1eed.  STATE AVERAGE PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE IS A  POOR PROXY FOR COST OF CHAPTER 1 SERVICES  Our earlier report also criticized the cur rent cost factor because it overstated cost  differences and unfairly benefitted wealthier  states that can afford to spend more on edu cation. S. 1513  tries to correct this bias to  some extent by reducing the range of this  factor from between 80 and 120 percent of the  U.S. average to between 85 and 115 percent.  However, we believe that the current meas ure of per pupil expend! ture is a poor proxy  for the cost of providing chapter 1 services.  EFFORT BONUS FACTOR MAY NOT TARGET HIGH  NEED STATES  The effort bonus may target more aid to  states with lower concentrations of children  in poverty and less to states with the highest  concentrations  of  such  children.  Such  targeting would be contrary to the objective  of  the program, which  is  to  target more  money  to  those places with greater con centrations of poverty and, hence, more edu cationally disadvantaged children.  The rationale for using an effort factor is  to introduce a  financial  incentive into the  formula for low spending states to increase  their effort  to adequately  fund  their edu cational systems. However, placing a  floor  on this factor of 5 percent less than the na tional average substantially reduces the im pact of this incentive. Because of the 95-per cent  floor,  a  low  spending state  that  in creases its effort may get little additional  benefit  in  the  form of a  larger chapter 1  grant. Similarly, by placing a  105-percent  ceiling on this factor, a high spending state  that decreases its effort may not have its  chapter 1 grant reduced substantially.  EQUITY BONUS FACTOR MAY NOT PROVIDE  INCENTIVES FOR sTATE REDUCTIONS  IN SPEND ING DISPARITIES  Finally, the equity bonus factor, while well  intended, is not likely to serve its intended  purpose-as an incentive for a state to de crease  in-state per pupil spending dispari ties-for three reasons:  (1) Chapter 1 funding is such a small por tion of total school spending that it is un likely  that it will cause states  to change  their school aid formulas to produce smaller  spending disparities.  (2) The floor placed on the factor so that it  cannot be less than 95 percent substantially  weakens the  incentive for states to reduce  per pupil spending disparities for precisely  those states with the largest inequities.  (3) The restriction that the factor can be  no more than 105 percent significantly re duces the penalty for states with the small est variation  in per pupil spending whose  performance deteriorates.  The equity bonus may tend to target less  aid to some states with larger spending dis parities in per pupil funding and generally  higher rates of child poverty and education ally disadvantaged children while targeting  more assistance  to  some  states with  the  smaller spending disparities and generally  ",1994
211,,103,-0.479,534,13,Mr. TUCKER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to  take  a moment  to  recognize  the  U.S.  Pharmacopeia! Convention,  Inc.  [USP]  and  Leiner Health Products. The congressionally  mandated USP has spent 2 years developing  voluntary standards for vitamins and minerals  to give consumers the ability to identify prod ucts  that have been  produced  to exacting  standards.  Leiner Health Products has be come the first and to date, the only company  to produce products  to meet  these pharma ceutical-level standards.  The USP  is a nongovernmental, voluntary  organization  that has been setting standards  to ensure the  integrity and uniform quality of  drug products since 1820. Recognizing  the  growing  importance of nutrition and supple ments  to  the Nation's health, USP began 2  years ago  to develop the  first quality stand ards ever established for vitamins.  USP is to be commended for this move to  protect the consumer and Leiner Health Prod ucts should  receive particular recognition  for  becoming  the  first company  to bring  these  standards  to  the marketplace. There  have  been debates  in  this chamber about labeling  requirements  for nutritional supplements, but  there can be no argument about the need for  consumers to be assured that the products in  the package are manufactured to the highest  standards  of purity, potency,  disintegration,  and dissolution. The USP standards mean that  consumers can be sure that the formulation is  precise and  that product performance and  quality will be at the levels usually reserved for  pharmaceutical products.  This did not come without a commitment.

Known for its commitment to so cial  justice and  racial equality,  the Call has  been a mainstay in Kansas City's black com munity  for  four generations and has gained  national recognition for maintaining the highest  standards of journalistic integrity.  The editor and publisher of  the Call, Miss  Lucile Bluford, is a national figure in her own  right, known for her commitment to civil rights  and her voracious pursuit of  the  truth. Miss  Bluford began her career  in  journalism more  than half a century ago.  In the 1920's, when  she was beginning to decide on a career, Miss  Bluford opted to pursue her dream of writing  for a newspaper, even though opportunities for  black women at that time were few and far be tween.  A champion of equal  rights  for all people,  Miss Bluford continues  to use the Call as a  voice for social change. As she stated in her  editorial printed in  the Call's 75th anniversary  edition, ""Our job over the years has been not  to print news about  the happenings  in  the  community, but to advocate and to campaign  for  justice,  first-class citizenship, democracy  and fairness.""  And, Mr. Speaker, Miss Bluford is joined by  Donna Stewart, who must  also  be  com mended for the energy, commitment, and  in telligence she has displayed as managing edi tor of the Call.  Over the span of 75 years, the Call has cov ered the issues at the heart of the community.  From  its  anti-lynching  campaigns  of  the  1920's,  to  its successful  fight against  racist  policies at  the University of Missouri  in  the  1930's, to its present-day battle against black on-black crime,  the Call has  kept  readers  abreast of each of these pressing social  is sues week in and week out. It will surely con tinue to be a voice for social justice for many  years to come.  After 75 years of not missing an  issue, the  Call's commitment  to serving  the community  continues undaunted. For as is noted in its di amond anniversary edition,  the Call will con tinue  to speak ""for the right of every citizen,  regardless of color,  to have decent housing,  employment, good schools, and equal oppor tunities.""  I am proud to convey my best wishes and  warmest congratulations to the Call on its 75th  anniversary. As  the Call  looks  forward  to  its  next 75 years,  I am confident that it will con tinue  to build on  its established  record of  seeking  truth and social  justice, and serving  as a shining light and moral compass for our  community.

213,House,103,-0.256,547,13,Ms. SCHENK.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today with mixed  emotions  ranging  from sadness to outrage. At 7:25  this  morning  in Pensacola, FL, a  radical  anti-abortion activist shot and killed  two men and wounded a woman outside  a family planning clinic. The two men  were escorts who accompany women  entering the clinic; the woman, a clinic  employee.  The  alleged gunman, Paul Hill  of  Pensacola, is the director of the radical  group ""Defense America of Pensacola,""  a group that advocates the use of force  against both clinics and doctors,  in  other words, a terrorist group.  Madam Speaker,  this Congress has  passed  legislation  guaranteeing  free  and safe access to family planning clin ics. We must now prosecute these ter rorists to the full extent of the law.  We have made much of the so-called  radical right; my colleagues, this is the  horrible face of the radical right.  Madam Speaker, I pray for the fami lies of the victims, and I pray that this  type of tragedy will not occur again.

One of these  terms is redact. What  the heck does redact mean?  Well, according to the dictionary def inition,  it means  to make  ready  for  publication,  to edit or revise. In con nection with the Whitewater investiga tion, redact takes on an even more in teresting definition.  Administration officials certainly did  redact documents before giving  them  to Republicans. Entire pages whited  out, 40 page memos, completely blank.  Thus, when it comes to Whitewater,  to redact means more than simply edit ing. It means to keep the truth from  the American people.

Breyer as an Associate Jus tice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge  Breyer is an impressive individual, not  only for his obvious intellectual acu men and professional success, but also  for his long record of dedication to pub lic service. Judge Breyer has earned a  wide array of support, reflected in the  views  of  the  labor  community,  the  business  community,  environmental ists, academics, and the American Bar  Association.  The Judiciary Committee performed  an examination of his ethical history  which  revealed  some  questions,  but  produced a profile of a  legal  thinker  and professional fully qualified for this  tremendously important position.  His history of judicial decision-mak ing reveals a man who weighs heavily  the effect of the law on human lives.  He does not adhere to any one strict  legal ideology but approaches the law  with a desire  to shape the law to fit  human needs. From the earliest age, he  was taught that one learns more from  people than books, and he has applied  this lesson not only to his professional  career but also to his family life, where  he has been an exemplary husband and  father, and in his community involve ment.  Mr.  President,  Judge Breyer  is  a  strong  candidate  for  the  Supreme  Court because of his wisdom,  intel ligence, and integrity. He will bring to  the Court a  commitment  to making  the law a positive force for achieving  justice  and  improving  the  lives  of  human beings. No  calling  is higher  than that of justice, and I am confident  that Judge Breyer will rise to that re sponsibility.   ",1994
218,Senate,103,0.575,638,13,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, I sup port the nomination of Judge Stephen  Breyer to serve as Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court. I believe that  the President has the right to appoint  the man of his  choosing and while  Judge Breyer may not be the jurist I  personally would pick for this position,  I respect that right of the President.  Judge Breyer has shown himself to be  a man of keen intellect. He was a dis tinguished academic and has had the  experience of serving in both the Exec utive and Legislative branches of Gov ernment.  In addition, he has  served  with distinction on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the First Circuit. However,  in spite of his fine qualities and many  achievements, my support  is not un qualified.  I have serious reservations  with  regard  to  statements made by  Judge Breyer in recent opinions as well  as,  his  judgment based on  evidence  which came  to  light during his con firmation hearings.  First of all, Judge Breyer's invest ment with Lloyd's of London Syn dicates raises several questions about  his good judgment. Not only has he ex posed himself to far reaching potential  liabilities, but he has opened himself  up to questions about conflicts of in terest on prior cases on which he sat.  More importantly, he now must recuse  himself on some of the most complex  and  important issues that this Court  will hear dealing with insurance and  the  environment. This  leads me  to  question his prudence and his  judg ment.  I would also hope that Judge Breyer  develops an increased awareness of and  sensitivity  to  the  rights  of private  property owners. Although he has not  written about the takings clause of the  fifth  amendment, he was questioned  about his approach to that issue during  Judiciary Committee hearings.  I will  not go into depth on that at this time,  but I would like to aligh myself with  the comments of my colleague  from  Idaho, Senator CRAIG, who spoke ear lier  on  that  issue Mr. President.  I  strongly endorse  the views of Chief  Justice Rehnquist who recently stated  in the case of Dolan v. City of Tigard,  (U.S. June 24, 1994)  that there is ""no  reason why the  takings clause of the  fifth amendment, as much a part of the  Bill of Rights as the first amendment  or fourth amendment, should be  rel egated  to  the status of a poor  rela tion.""  Finally, I followed with interest the  questions posed to Judge Breyer with  regard to religious schooling and home  schooling. His opinion in New Life Bap tist Church Academy versus Town of  East Longmeadow, that town authori ties could conduct a review of the cur riculum of a  religious school, caused  me  some  initial  concern. However,  based on his responses to Senator SIMP SON's questions, I am encouraged that  ",1994
219,Senate,103,-0.319,729,13,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, the U.S.  Senate will shortly consider H.R. 4624,  the VA, HUD, and  independent agen cies appropriations bill, and S. 2281, the  Housing Choice and Community Invest ment Act. During  consideration  of  these measures, I understand, attempts  will be made to raise the Federal Hous ing Administration's (FHA) loan limits  to $101,575 nationally and to $172,678 in  high costs areas.  I commend  the sponsors of S. 2281  and H.R. 4624 for their efforts to expand  the FHA mortgage  loan  limits. How ever,  the expansion does not go  far  enough. I would like to inform my col leagues of Hawaii's situation and why  the FHA program is not readily acces sible to potential home buyers residing  in my State. I was hoping to seek some  relief in the form of an amendment to  S. 2281 or H.R. 4624. However, it appears  that the climate is not right.  For the record, I have and will con tinue  to support loan limit increases  for the FHA program. In Honolulu, HI,  where the median sales price of a single  family home is over $350,000, the avail ability of FHA loans is extremely limited. A higher loan limit, in my view,  would eliminate large gaps which ex ists between  the median home price  and the FHA loan limit.  Opponents will argue  that  there  is  greater risk of default and foreclosure  should the FHA mortgage loan ceiling  amount be increased. Although Hawaii  is considered one of the highest priced  areas for single family homes, we have  one of  the  lowest default and  fore closure  rates  in  the Nation.  Con sequently,  I believe  raising  the  loan  limit will help  strengthen  the FHA  portfolio, and provide better accessibil ity to the program by residents of my  State.  It is extremely unfortunate that the  FHA insured loan product in Hawaii is  not meeting the needs of the individ uals it was designed to help. The mort gage limits imposed by the FHA have  limited  the number of single  family  homes  that can be  insured and  the  down  payment  requirements  under  FHA guidelines  effectively eliminate  borrowers who can clearly make  the  monthly mortgage payment. Many in dividuals are paying rent in an amount  that is equal  to or above what their  mortgage payments would be, but do  not have the ability to accumulate the  required down payment. Due  to  the  high cost of housing in Hawaii, FHA  borrowers must make  a  significant  cash contribution  to  the  transaction.  This is a hardship not endured in other  parts of the country.  In 1992, under the Housing and Com munity Development Act of 1992, Pub lic Law 102-550,  the Congress amended  the National Housing Act to increase  the down payment requirements on the  FHA  program. Currently,  the  down  payment requirements are 3 percent on  the first $25,000 of the mortgage loan  amount; 5 percent on the amount be tween $25,000 and $125,000; and 10 per cent on amounts above $125,000. Unfor tunately, the 10 percent down payment  requirement excludes many of Hawaii's  potential home buyers from acquiring  affordable housing.  The  provisions under  the Housing  Choice and Community Investment Act  of 1994 which grants the Secretary of  the Department of Housing and Urban  Development to enter into risk-sharing  arrangements with State  and  local  agencies to insure single family mort gage on properties located in high cost  areas will help Hawaii to address the  higher loan limit requirements. How ever, it does nothing to provide relief  towards  the  down payment  require ments .  I urge my colleagues on the Senate  Banking Committee to review Hawaii's  problem with  the down payment  re quirements  so  that  potential  home  buyers will have better accessibility to  the FHA program.

YOUNG AMBASSADORS FROM  ROMANIA  HON. ELEANOR HOLMFS NORTON  OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, August 1, 1994  ",1994
223,,103,-0.487,820,13,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize a special  individual and dedicated  educator, Dr. Stuart E. Gothold, superintend ent of Los Angeles County Schools.  As superintendent, Dr. Gothold has dedi cated over 35 years of service to providing our  children with a superior public education. Re sponsible for 200 school sites, 3,400 employ ees, 15,000 students, and an annual budget of  $339 million, he has gained a reputation as an  effective administrator and  visionary  leader  who has admirably led county schools through  tough economic times.  Dr. Gothold  is well  respected and admired  for his involvement in local, county, State and  national issues and efforts to improve our edu cational system. Most notably, he has directed  the development of strategic plans to position  the office of education as a key voice in Cali fornia  public  education;  established model  choice  high  schools-arts and  international  business-on California State University cam puses;  and  established  community-based  schools for at-risk youth.  In addition to his extensive professional re sponsibilitfes, Dr. Gothold  has  volunteered  countless hours to  the community. He is co chair of the Los Angeles County Music Center  Education Council, co-chair of Rebuild Los An geles Education task force, and active mem ber of countless civic organizations.  including  Workforce Los Angeles, Los Angeles Area  Boy Scouts Council,  the United Way cam paign, and the Santa Fe Springs Rotary Club.  As he assumes new challenges as clinical  professor of educational administration at the  University of Southern California, he  leaves  behind a legacy of commitment and dedication  to the educational well-being of our children.  His footsteps will be hard to follow.  ",1994
224,Senate,103,0.46,833,13,Mr. KEMPTHORNE.," Mr. President,  thank you very much.  I would like to add my support to the  amendment that is before us. I would  like to reference this idea that if we  really want to help the poor areas, in  this  case  with  reference  to  poor  schools, that we should reject this.  Last year I went to Philadelphia. I  went to meet with the mayor of Phila delphia, Ed Rendell, who is doing a tre mendous job as mayor of Philadelphia,  and who I consider a  friend.  I asked  him to show me the neighborhoods in  Philadelphia where  they  truly have  problems  of massive  unemployment,  security problems, where the kids are  having a hard time.  We went to some of these neighbor hoods where  there was graffiti every where, where  there were bars on  the  windows of all  the homes,  the shops,  churches. The churches and  the hos pitals in this particular neighborhood  were also covered with graffiti-! could  not believe  that even churches were  covered-and where it was a dangerous  area.  But in the center of this was a new  housing unit  that had been built by  those people in that area. I met with  the  construction  supervisor,  whose  name was Carlos. Carlos, in his discus sion with me-in showing me the qual ity of the workmanship that they were  so proud of, and the fact that this was  one  island in that neighborhood that  was totally unmarked by graffiti, it did  not  have  bars  on  the windows-he  brought up and volunteered-! did not  even bring up the topic-but he said,  ""Please,  do  something about Davis Bacon  because,  if we  could  remove  Davis-Bacon provisions on these types  of projects, we  could build more of  them and employ more people. It is  what my people in this neighborhood of  Philadelphia need  to have happen so  that we can bring about some better  quality housing and bring about dig nity into that area.""  Carlos said to me, ""Please, do some thing  about  the Davis-Bacon Act.""  This is a first step.  I would not say that my colleague  from Idaho is late in bringing this up.  Thank goodness, he is persistent, like a  number of people are going to be per sistent until finally we do something  with the Davis-Bacon Act.  Mr. President, I yield my time back  to the senior Senator from Idaho.  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.  ",1994
225,Senate,103,-0.334,885,13,Mr. WOFFORD.," Mr. President,  the  Improving America's Schools Act will  give our communities  the  tools  they  need to improve their schools. It will  help schools strengthen basic skills through an invigorated chapter I pro gram and expanded staff development.  It will also bring badly needed  tech nology to schools around the Nation.  I am particularly pleased  that this  legislation includes the Safe and Drug  Free Schools Act-legislation I  intro duced to provide parents, teachers, and  students with the  tools  they need to  fight violence in our schools.  A recent survey showed that only 29  percent of parents believe  that  their  children are safe in school. According  to  the Centers  for Disease Control,  nearly 3 million crimes occur on or  near school campuses very year-one  every six seconds. It is estimated that  over one hundred  thousand students  carry guns to school each day. Thou sands of students and  teachers alike  are  victims of physical  attacks  or  threats of violence. It is a  terrifying  situation. And, it is a scandal.  Marleihia Harper,  a  student at  a  Philadelphia high school, says that vio lence  is an everyday occurrence. She  says that even the hand-held metal de tectors are not enough  to keep guns  and knives out of her school. And when  it rains, the crack vials float in puddles  in the schoolyard.  Marleihia  attends  a  large  urban  school. But  school  violence has  in fected our rural and suburban schools  as well.  I  recently visited a  smaller  school in Wilkes-Barre where a poll of  students found that 52 percent of stu dents knew  someone who brought a  weapon to school and 72 percent said  they witnessed violence at their school  in the past year.  The  seventh  National  Education  Goal, established by the Nation's Gov ernors, states, ""By the year 2000, every  school in America will be free of drugs  and violence and will offer a disciplined  environment conducive  to  learning.''  The  legislation we  are  considering  today will bring us closer to that goal.  The Safe and Drug Free School Act  will help local school districts develop  and carry out comprehensive programs  to  prevent  destructive  behavior.  Schools will be able  to attack  their  own  individual  problems  head-on.  Schools could use funds to fit their own  unique needs to develop programs such  as teacher training, conflict resolution  training for students, antigang efforts,  or they could use funds  to develop a  partnership with  the  police,  or  a  mentoring program with members of  the business community.  Feelings of hopelessness, alienation,  and cynicism  that lure children into  using drugs also lead to violent behav ior. Since drug use and violence often  go hand and hand, the most promising  strategy is comprehensive, coordinated  school and community efforts, efforts  that bring together families, students,  community organizations, and law en forcement. This  legislation will  sup port these efforts.  This legislation does not create an other Federal program and bureauc racy. Rather, it alters an existing pro gram to better meet the challenges fac ing our schools today. It will not bur den schools with rigid,  top-down, bu reaucratic rules, but will leave commu ni ties free to produce the best course of  action and give them some of the re sources needed to get things done.  Many  Pennsylvania  communities  have taken the lead in attacking vio lence  in schools.  In recent months I  have met  with  students,  parents,  teachers, and administrators from all  parts of Pennsylvania who  told me  their own stories of the violence they  see in their schools and how this legis lation will help  them do  something  about it. In Pittsburgh, the school dis trict formed a task force that's taking  the ideas of parents to work to elimi nate violence among young people. In  Philadelphia, I walked with a group of  concerned parents and clergy-led by  my friend Rev. William B. Moore-in  the safe corriders program, which pro tects children on their way to and from  school. Also in Philadelphia, Veronica  Joyner, a caring and dynamic commu nity leader, has created a parents pro gram that brings activities into some  of the cities most violent schools. In  Reading, a peer mediation program is  teaching children how  to settle their  own  disputes without  resorting  to  weapons,  punches,  and  insults.  In  Wilkes-Barre,  the district attorney is  working with local schools to prevent  youth violence. And in Harrisburg, par ents have joined together to provide a  daily presence in the schools.  Education is the one sure path to a  better life  for every American child.  But children cannot learn if they do  not feel safe. The Safe and Drug Free  Schools Act will help us to once again  make  our  schools  a  safe  haven  of  knowledge, hope, and security.  I am also pleased that this legisla tion incorporates key provisions of the  Service Learning Act of 1993, which I  introduced  with  Senators  DUREN BERGER,KENNEDY,and WELLSTONE. The  Service Learning Act is based on a sim ple yet powerful truth: students learn  best by doing, by being active and en gaged in the process of learning.  In 1990,  the President of the United  States and all 50 Governors recognized  this approach as an integral part of our  Nation's educational goals.  In  their  Charlottesville Declaration,  they pro posed that all States and school sys tems act  to ensure  that by  the year  ",1994

228,House,103,-0.184,1002,13,Mr. BILBRAY.," Mr. Speaker, we are  addressing health care. It is coming up  in the next few weeks. I would like to  talk about those 7 million people with  diabetes around this country and an other 6 million people that have diabe tes that do not even know about it. It  is critical that health care reform pass  because most  of  them  cannot  get  health insurance unless they belong to  a  large plan  that has negotiated so  that they cannot be excluded. Most of  them do not have health care insurance  and cannot get health care insurance.  Over 160,000 people die each year as a  result of diabetes.  I can  tell my colleagues it hit my  family personally because my own son  died  from diabetes,  so  I can say we  need health care reform, Mr. Speaker,  now. We need universal coverage. We  need it so no preexisting conditions can  be excluded because Americans deserve  that  they could have assurance  that  they can have health care, they have  insurance for it, and, if we do not allow  this for our people, then it is a crying  shame,  something  that we will  be  ashamed of for generations to come.  THE CRIME BILL?  (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1994
229,House,103,-0.444,1015,13,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman,  last November,  the  Merchant Marine and Fisheries Com mittee brought before the House H.R.  2151, the Maritime Competitiveness and  Security Act of 1993. This bill author ized two new programs to help revital ize our U.S.-flag fleet and U.S. ship yards.  On  that day  last November,  this  House voted overwhelmingly, by a mar gin of 347  to 65,  to support our Amer ican maritime  industries. Today, we  ask for your vote  to ensure that the  will of the House becomes a  reality:  that American  flags continue  to  fly  from  vessels  carrying  this Nation's  commerce;  tl::.at American  shipyards  will someday soon build another com mercial vessel;  that when American  servicemen and servicewomen are sent  to distant corners of  the globe  they  ",1994
230,House,103,0.242,1028,13,Mr. BATEMAN.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to make my  colleagues  aware that the thrust of this amend ment is to increase the authorization  level for funding for the title XI loan  guarantee program. This is a program  which is worked with some modest suc cess. It has, unfortunately, been a very  modest success, but it does have  the  potential,  if utilized,  to assist us  in  staying alive in the shipbuilding indus try.  There are pending before  the Mari time Administration more requests for  loan guarantees  than  the amount of  money  that  is  presently  authorized  would  permit. The  purpose  of  this  amendment is to increase that amount  as an incentive and as a hope that we  will again begin to build ships in Amer ican shipyards.  Mr. Chairman,  reference has  been  made to the fact that we in the United  States have not subsidized shipbuilding  since 1981, and that is indeed the case,  and I  think it fair  to point out that  since we no longer subsidize ships after  1981, a  total of three contracts for the  construction of merchant ocean-going  vessels have been constructed in Amer ican shipyards, only  three, and  those  all for our Jones Act or our internal  trade within our coastal waters, noth ing  for  international commerce. Cer tainly, if we are going to purport to re main a maritime power, we cannot let  American  shipbuilding  die.  It needs  this assistance, and I would urge  the  approval of this amendment.  ",1994

232,House,103,-0.398,1028,13,Mr. ANDREWS of Maine.," Mr. Chair man, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, my colleagues,  last  night  the  rock  group  the Rolling  Stones were  in Washington, DC, and  they have a  song, a popular song,  in  which they sing the words: ""You can't  always get what you want, but, if you  try, sometimes you just may find that  you get what you need.""  Well, my colleagues, for the past sev eral  years  the  shipbuilders  in  this  country have not been able to get what  they want,  a  level  playing  field,  a  chance to compete fairly with competi tors around the world. But there is one  thing  that  those  shipbuilders  need.  They need a government  that  is on  their side. They need a Congress that is  on their side. They need an administra tion that is on their side so that they  can get what they want, a fair chance  to  take advantage of the  tremendous  opportunities that we are  looking at  right now in this country, and that is  the promise of shipbuilding contracts  to meet the demands of a potential ex plosion of orders to meet this tremen dous  opportunity  of  international  trade.  The fact of the matter is, my col leagues,  that we  have watched  the  elimination of 120,000 good-paying ship building jobs in this country over the  0  last 10 years because the shipbuilders  of this country have not had a govern ment on  their side willing  to  stand  firm with them and for them to give  them the chance to compete fairly.  1510  As a result, we have lost good paying  jobs  to our competitor nations over seas. And despite the fact that we are  looking at the promise of new opportu nities and new shipbuilding orders that  could create good paying jobs in this  country, we understand that some are  projecting a further loss of 180,000 more  jobs unless we are able to turn this un acceptable situation around.  Some analysts have projected a $356  billion commercial shipbuilding  trade  opportunity over the course of the next  10 years. We have to decide in this Con gress whether or not we are going to  give our shipbuilders what they need, a  fair opportunity  to compete for  that  market. And  if we are serious about  giving them what they need, then we  have got to give them a lot more than  a bunch of political platitudes and hot  air in the halls of Congress. We have  got to give them the resources to do  the job. We have got to stand up and  say yes, we are going to provide you  with  the  loan guarantees  that will  make you competitive; we are going to  stand up and help you  to modernize  your shipyards so that you can be com petitive; we are going to be willing to  provide you with the tools and the re sources and the investment that you  need  in order  to compete on a  level  playing field now that we are finally  making progress and leveling the inter national trade playing field across this  planet.  The shipbuilders of this country are  not asking for a  lot. They are asking  for fairness. They are pointing to their  competitors, and their competitor na tions, that have been on their side for  the  last 12 years, who have been on  their side with unfair subsidies and in vestments, who have been on their side  taking away our jobs. And all our ship builders are asking is for their govern ment, our government, to be on their  side as well, to give them the chance to  compete,  to give  them the chance to  succeed,  to give  them  the chance  to  have good paying jobs not only remain  in this country, but grow in this coun try, to be able to take market share,  and be able  to build first class ships  with innovative designs and technology  to meet  this growing demand  inter nationally.  Is that too much to ask? Is that too  much to ask? I do not think so.  Mr. Chairman, I hope that when we  finally cast our votes on this very im portant issue that we will be willing to  go to the wall and do what needs to be  done  to provide our shipbuilders with  what they need, a Congress that is on  their side, and with what they want, a  fair chance to compete.  ",1994
233,House,103,0.47,1041,13,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am here  to  talk  tonight about  the continuing  degradation of America's security and  national defenses, but before I do that,  I would like to comment 1 minute on  the  announcement  by  the majority  that they are going to be bringing up  the so-called health reform bill shortly  and just comment that at least as one  Representative who has talked to his  people for the last year or so about this  prospective bill,  then called the Clin ton package, it takes a while for the  American people to understand what is  in this package. I think what defeated  the President's initial effort was  the  fact that the people saw the package. I  think it is appropriate for the majority  to give the American people a chance  to see it, to see the package, a chance  for small business to look at the man dates  that  they will  be  operating  under, decide whether or not they are  going to have to lay off people as a re sult of  those mandates,  decide  how  many people they are going to have to  lay off,  talk a  little bit to  their em ployees, some of whom will be the pro spective folks who will be laid off as a  result of  these burdens, and  let  the  American people analyze this, what I  call the Clinton II health care package.  Because  it was  the people, not  this  House and not people  in Washington  but  the people of  the United States  who  essentially  defeated  the Presi dent's first attempt to socialize medi cine. They  should  certainly have  a  chance to look at this second attempt  before we vote on this bill.  Mr. Speaker,  let me  talk about an  issue that was a very important issue  in the late 1970's and is becoming im portant again because it is becoming  an issue of some urgency, and that is  the security of our country. It is the  degradation  in  the  readiness of our  Armed Forces  to carry out our na tional security policy and  to enforce  our foreign policy. Disturbing  trends  are coming out of the Pentagon right  now. They are coming  from all  the  services. The Army,  the Marines,  the  Air Force, and the Navy are all report ing that it is more difficult now  for  them to recruit qualified personnel, a  problem  that we had  in  the hollow  military of the late 1970's before Presi dent Reagan was elected and rebuilt  national defense with the Republicans.  We are seeing a degradation in our re pair rates for equipment. The operation  and maintenance rates, major repair of  large pieces of equipment is now down  to about 62 percent of what we need to  be doing.  We  have an ammunition  stockpile  that is deteriorating. We saw, at least  with respect to the report that I have  examined,  the expenditure of almost  all of our smart weapons, those weap ons that can zero in on a small target  and be guided very accurately to their  target. We have seen that stockpile re duced to the point where in a regular  conflict, in a medium-sized conflict, all  those smart weapons would be used in  about 1 day.  We  have  seen  transportation prob lems. We understand now that we do  not have a good ammunition port on  the west coast, that it might be very,  very difficult  to bring all of our Re serves up  in  time  to  start moving  transportation of heavy equipment and  supplies to a regional conflict. And the  recent reports on readiness that have  been coming from the Defense Science  Board and from the Pen tag on itself say  that it is going to be, very, very dif ficult to handle two regional conflicts  at the same time.  President Clinton has decided to cut  $129  billion out of national  security  over the next 5 years and that is below  the $50 billion cut that then-President  Bush,  then-Secretary of Defense Dick  Cheney and then-Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs Colin Powell decided to make a  couple of years ago. So they went $50  billion under the projected 5-year plan  and then President Clinton came along,  having been elected, and decided to cut  $129 billion below that plan and that,  my colleagues,  is hollowing out our  forces.  Remember that phrase in the 1970's,  the hollow  forces? We  are hollowing  out right now America's military capa bility.  D 1710  Back in the 1970's we had young Navy  families  that were  on  food  stamps.  They were being  told by  their com manders not to be ashamed to line up  and get food stamps to supplement the  hard-earned  pay  they  received  for  sometimes working 10, 12, and 18 hours  a day.  Well today our military families are  up to $27 million annually usage of food  stamps. They have gone up $3 million  in just the last year.  I will continue this special order to morrow and get into other areas.  SMALL  BUSINESS  ADMINISTRA TION PROMOTION OF EMPLOYER  MANDATES  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  MANN). Under a previous order of the  House,  the gentleman from California  [Mr. KIM] is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1994
234,House,103,0.39,1041,13,Mr. KIM.," Mr. Speaker, when I came  here 2 years ago as a former small busi ness owner,  I  thought  that  I would  have an opportunity  to work to help  small businesses. Unfortunately,  that  doesn't seem to be the case.  This morning, I was going to offer an  amendment to a bill-H.R. 4801-which  was scheduled to be debated and voted  on today, but suddenly the entire bill  was removed.  My amendment was simple: It would  prohibit the Small Business Adminis tration from spending taxpayer dollars  to promote employer mandates.  This amendment is necessary because  the SBA spent over $100,000  in fiscal  year 1994  funds  to promote employer  mandates-telling small business own ers that employer mandates would be  good for them. The SBA has also spent  appropriated  funds  to  send Erskine  Bowles,  the  SBA Administrator,  to  town hall meetings to spread the word  about  the benefits of employer man dates.  What is disturbing about this is that  the SBA is promoting employer man dates in spite of the fact that employer  mandates will hurt the very small busi nesses that the SBA is supposed to rep resent.  In case you have any doubt about  this fact, just look at the evidence: Al most every credible study predicts sub stantial wage and job loss as a result of  employer mandates. A  study by  the  CONSAD Research Corp., for example,  predicts  that over 1 million workers  could lose their jobs as a result of em ployer mandates. Another study, done  by  the State of California, predicts  that over 3 million employees will lose  their jobs.  The  evidence  also  shows  that  the  owners and employees of small busi nesses are overwhelmingly opposed to  employer mandates. For example,  in  six out of  seven White House  con ferences  on  small business,  held  in  seven different States, small business  owners voted overwhelmingly to reject  employer mandates.  In other words,  the SBA has spent  taxpayer dollars  to promote a policy  which the evidence shows will be bad  for  small businesses  and which  the  owners and employees of small busi nesses overwhelmingly oppose.  My amendment would address  this  shameful situation by prohibiting the  Small Business Administration  from  spending funds authorized by H.R. 4801  to promote employer mandates.  Then,  the Rules Committee, which  decides what amendments are allowed  to be offered on the floor, voted to pro hibit me  from  offering my  amend ment-even  though  the  amendment  was  ruled perfectly germane by  the  House Parliamentarian.  In response  to this ridiculous si tua tion, I was going to offer a motion to  recommit before the vote on final pas sage. This motion would have  forced  the House to vote on my amendment.  Not surprisingly, just as I was pre paring to offer my motion, the Demo cratic  leadership-without any warn ing-suddenly decided to pull H.R. 4801  from the floor-despite the fact that we  had already started to debate the bill  last Friday.  Why did they do this? The answer is  simple: They are  terrified. They are  terrified that if the issue of employer  mandates comes up for a vote in  the  House, this body might vote to reject  this job-killing proposal. In fact,  they  are so  terrified that they won't even  ",1994

251,,103,-0.28,1379,13,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call  attention to the special achievements and out standing  hard work  of  a  constituent, Mr.  Woodrow Bowman. Mr. Bowman, who worked  on a farm as a boy, founded Woody's Market  in West Carrollton, OH, on July 2, 1944. Dur ing  the past 50 years, Mr. Bowman has ex panded  the original market  from an outdoor,  one-person  roadside stand  into a giant inde pendent  supermarket with  nearly  1 00,000  square feet of area under one roof, employing  about 500 people.  Woody's Market  is equipped with  its own  bakery,  general  grocery,  seafood,  poultry,  meat,  fresh produce, delicatessen, and  florist  departments,  in addition  to a pharmacy and  full  service  restaurant,  providing  the West  Carrollton  community and  surrounding area  with a convenient, one-step shopping center.  Woody's Market was the first supermarket in  the entire Dayton area to  introduce ?-day-a week, 24-hour customer service. During  the  past 50 years, Woody's Market has constantly  supported community organizations, charitable  groups, and service clubs, becoming known  as  the Cornerstone of  the West Carrollton  Community.  Woody's Market celebrated its 50th year of  operation in West Carrollton on Saturday, July  ",1994
252,Senate,103,0.39,48,20,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, those let ters opposing Judge Sarokin come from  the National Organization of Fraternal  Order for Police, the Fraternal Order of  Police  in Newark, NJ,  the Fraternal  Order of Police  in Philadelphia,  the  Law Enforcement Alliance of America,  the  Organized  Victims  of Violent  Crime, the sheriffs in New Jersey, the  Joe Occhipinti Legal Defense Fund,  and the League of American Families.  And I would like to read from one of  the letters just a passage that really  bothered me. It is from the Fraternal  Order of Police, Newark, Lodge Num ber 12.  DEAR SENATOR: I am writing at this time  in order to express our strongest opposition  to the appointment of Judge H. Lee SarokiD  to the court of appeals. As President of the  Newark Fraternal Order of Police with ex cess of 1,500 members,  the appointment of  this liberal jurist to such an important posi tion would be an insult to every Newark po lice officer who ever wore a badge.  That  is pretty strong, and  that  is  from New Jersey. That is from the area  where this judge has been ruling.  There  are  comments  like  this  throughout these letters and they are  not frivolous, light letters. They refer  to specific cases and specific rulings by  this particular judge.  I would  like  to note, also, a piece  that has been written by the Coalition  of America that goes through a list of  concerns about Judge Sarokin and in cluding several of the cases that have  already been referred to about how he  opposes mandatory uniform sentencing  and his involvement in the cop killer  case and  that he has  ignored  law  to  create  loopholes  for criminal defend ants.  The evidence against Judge Sarokin  is clear. He should not be given a pro motion. He  really  should  be  under  questioning about why he should be al lowed to stay where he is with all this  conduct, like being taken off a case by  the appellate court-and now we are  going to promote him to serve in that  same appellate court.  I  think he has  done enough damage already. Putting  on a robe of a judge does not make any body above the law or precedents.  Our legal system is meant to find jus tice, not  to undertake crusades. Our  judges should follow the law and pun ish wrongdoing, not throw away  laws  when it is convenient, or free criminals  because of the judge's own views or the  politics of the case.  Judge Sarokin has  thrown out  law  and precedent, he has undertaken cru sades, and he has not been impartial.  Can we  trust him now with a higher,  more important position?  ",1994
253,House,103,-0.448,178,20,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, my col leagues and others have  seen a  full  page  ad  in  the Washington  papers  today outlining what was said to be a  ""corrupt deal"" involving pioneer pref erence. The hard facts of the matter  are  that  the proposal  in  the GATT  treaty legislation is legislation which  in fact is going to cost the Washington  Post and others more. And it is going  to make it assured rather than doubt ful that they will be paying a signifi cant  amount  of  money,  perhaps  amounting to billions of dollars, to the  Federal Government  in exchange  for  these pioneer preferences.  As the matter originally came forth  from  the  Federal  Communications  Commission, these licenses were going  to be given for nothing. Because of the  efforts of  the Committee on Energy  and Commerce and because of the co operation of the FCC, an attempt has  been made  to administratively  raise  this to 90 percent of the cost.  In point of  fact,  this  raises  some  question because of the doubtful au thority of the commission  to do  so.  Now we are having to do this matter by  legislation.  Do not listen to  this kind of false hood. I will advise further to my col leagues by a letter which I will be com municating to them and a letter to the  editor on this matter.

254,House,103,-0.171,178,20,Mr. BARCA of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speak er, I rise today to bring attention to  one of our Nation's most serious prob lems, domestic violence.  I would like  to  thank my distinguished colleague,  the gentlewoman from California [Ms.  ROYBAL-ALLARD]  for arranging today's  important discussion.  In my congressional district alone,  hundreds of women and their families  seek protection from abusive spouses.  In the last year, there has been far too  many incidents of abuse and at least  one domestic homicide in Wisconsin's  First Congressional District.  We have made solid progress in ad dressing this problem with the passage  of the Violent Crime and Law Enforce ment Act. Provisions of this legislation  include  requiring  interstate  enforce ment  of  protection  orders  and  strengthening services  for victims of  domestic  and  gender-based  violence.  Fortunately for the people of Wiscon sin we have a solid cluster of centers  th~t provide quality services for their  victims. The people  in my  congres sional district are taking steps to ad dress this serious problem. On October  14,  a  speakout and candlelight vigil  will be held to end domestic and sexual  ",1994

258,House,103,0.339,308,20,Mr. UPTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to night also in tribute to a man of his  convictions. The Michigan delegation  traditionally has worked very closely,  and we are always there to help our  State,  regardless of  the party affili ation. BILL FORD has served his con stituency very well for over 30 years.  Those of us on this side of the aisle,  the Republican side, recognize him as a  darned good adversary. I know my good  friend, BILL GooDLING,  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania, talked about bark,  no bite. I might suggest there may be  a few broken ankles, bitten ankles, or  a few broken arms on this side.  However, I will tell you that as chair man of the Committee on Education  and Labor, he has over the years been  able to leave his fingerprints on land mark  legislation  impacting  every  American, bills like Head Start, mini mum wage, plant closing notification,  parental  leave, Pell grants, national  service,  Hatch Act  reform, motor  voter.  He has always stood for the working  man and woman in every sense of the  word. He has been a  tenacious fighter  in all of his days.  Mr. Speaker, I must say that I have  appreciated  the  relationship  that we  have had the last number of years. Yes,  we have disagreed on a number of is sues, but we have agreed on a number  of them as well. I  learned early that  when I was on the other side, he usu ally had the votes to roll my side, but  when we were on the same side, it was  an awful lot of fun to win together.  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of  ways that a congressional career can  end: redistricting, defeat, death, mov ing to the lower body, the Senate, and,  of course, the one of voluntary retire ment. BILL FORD has chosen the latter  course.  BILL, you can hold your head high.  You have changed the way of life for  many Americans, all Americans, and I  know that you are proud of every mo ment  that you have  served  in  this  Chamber. All of us in the Michigan del egation,  Republican  and Democrat,  wish you well in the months and years  ahead. Thank  you  for  your  distin guished career here.  ",1994
259,House,103,-0.385,308,20,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the dean of the delegation for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, in my life in politics I  have had certain heroes whom I have  tried  to  emulate. Among  those  are  some whose names you would not even  recognize: Bill Ryan of the Michigan  House of Representatives; Neal Stabler,  congressman-at-large,  and  these  are  people who guided me; Phil Hart, Sen ator Phil Hart;  to mention a Repub lican, Governor Bill Milliken of Michi gan, and BILL FORD. They have really  helped me form my political philoso phy and my life of service to the people  of my district, and BILL FORD has been  one of the great ones in that group.  Mr. Speaker, when I first met BILL  FORD formerly, he was well known in  Michigan for having served on the con stitutional convention and in the Sen ate, but I met him down here in my  first year  in  the Michigan House of  Representatives, and I believe it was  BILL's first year here in the Congress of  the United States. I had become chair man of what was called the Federal Re lations Committee, an old committee  in  the Michigan  legislature which  dated back to the Civil War.  0 2350  Speaker Kowalski  sent me  down  here, it was during the heyday of Lyn don Johnson, to see what we could do  to improve education in the State of  Michigan.  I  thought  if  I  could get  maybe 5 or 10 minutes with BILL FORD,  that would be great. I was ushered into  BILL's office and we spent an hour and  a half, and he really informed me as to  the role of the Federal Government in  education.  I will  remember  to my  dying day  that meeting, because  it  really helped form my philosophy, that  education is a  local function, a State  responsibility, but a very, very impor tant Federal concern. He has certainly  translated  that Federal  concern  to  touch the lives of people in this coun try. The working men and women of  this country are certainly indebted to  BILL FORD. Their lives are better be cause of BILL FORD. They have a safer  workplace in which to live because of  BILL  FORD. The minimum wage has  been increased because of BILL FORD.  The quality of their  lives and  their  families are better.  And then the students. I have trav eled through many a college campus in  this country and have seen students'  lives  touched by  that attitude,  that  education in this country is not an ex penditure, it is a real investment.

260,,103,-0.172,347,20,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, on September  23, 1994 Gen. Carl Mundy, the Commandant  of  the Marine Corps, spoke  to  the military  Order of the World Wars, Greater Kansas City  Chapter. This dinner honored  foreign officers  attending  the Command and General Staff  College at Fort Leavenworth, KS.  General Mundy's remarks were quite appro priate for the occasion, as they reflect excel lent military  thinking and  foresight.  I  include  the remarks made by General Mundy:  REMARKS TO THE MILITARY ORDER OF THE  WORLD WARS MADE BY GEN. CARL MUNDY  This is the second time this year I've had  the pleasure of addressing the Military Order  of the World Wars. In January, I spoke to  your National Convention down in Charles ton-and the warmth and enthusiasm of your  welcome there made it hard to resist a sec ond opportunity to visit with you.  Another  reason  I  jumped at  the oppor tunity to come out here is the chance to ad dress an organization that captures so much  that's  good  about America-the  remem brance of honorable service rendered abroad  from the First World War to today, and, also,  a strong sense of ongoing public service. The  support you give ROTC, your education pro grams like the Patriotic Education Founda tion, and your regional youth leadership con ferences--these are all very important initia tives, and  they have a powerful-and posi tive-effect on the young people of our coun try.  I'm also pleased and honored to be up here  with Congressman SKELTON. I think it's par ticularly fitting that he be here tonight at  this gathering  that honors Command and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  General Staff College students, because he  has been one of the true leaders in the Con gress on the  issue of professional military  education.  Tonight, as we honor the International Of ficers in attendance at Command and Gen eral Staff College, I want to take a few min utes to talk to you about our national de fense capabilities and  the requirements of  the post cold-war world.  As you know, I wear two hats-as a mem ber of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as a  Service Chief. I'm going to give you the per spective I have from both of those jobs. The  National Security environment is as unclear  as it has ever been in my lifetime. Since our  victory in the cold war,  there have been a  number of flashpoints that required U.S. and  U.N. intervention. Some of these have been  natural disasters--the rest man-made-but  all have required the use of U.S. forces. We  also have challenges at home that all of us  want to address--from crime, to health care,  to education. DOD  isn't going to fix  these  latter problems, but we can help to meet the  challenges--both foreign and domestic-that  face us.  How  we  defend  our  Nation  in  this  multipolar, regionally oriented world is both  straightforward, yet difficult: we must be  ready-both for  the rational and  the obvi ous--and also, for the irrational and the un expected. We can't always choose when and  where we'll have to fight. All states don't be have rationally. For example, North Korea  in 1950, Iraq in 1990, and most recently, the  dictators in Haiti, weren't operating within  the same rational calculus that shapes most  of our foreign policies.  We must be prepared to meet the require ments  that stem  from  these challenges- from  the overriding danger of nuclear proliferation-to  the serious  threats of major  region~:~.l conflicts--and to the more  likely,  almost everyday threats that require deter rence and crisis response. In other words, for  every potential Desert Storm, there will be  dozens of potential Somalias and Haitis.  In a way, our. problems are more difficult  because  of our  own  success. Today-to night-the armed forces of the United States  are the gold standard-the standard against  which all armed forces are measured.  But that means we're also an open book and we're being carefully studied by people  out there who don't wish us well. We can rest  assured, I think, that potential future adver saries will avoid Desert Storm-type encoun ters. While we may have a  superb Army,  they'll avoid a direct conventional conflict.  Our Air Force is clearly the world's best, but  we may find it hard to find attackable tar gets. All our opponents won't  array  their  forces on a billiard table. In other words, ev eryone has read the after-action reports on  Desert Storm, and,  just as we apply those  lessons, we can expect our enemies to do the  same. It certainly complicates the. way we  approach future defense issues.  We're in a period of reorganizing the De partment of Defense, and to help meet those  domestic  challenges  I mentioned  before,  we've begun a period of steep decline of de fense spending. The spending  level  for de fense as a percentage of the gross national  product is the smallest since 1948. We're on  track to have, by 1997, the fewest number of  men and women in uniform in 57 years--the  fewest since 1940.  Let me give you a brief example of some  pretty dramatic changes in capabilities that  we've already undertaken. We no longer have  any nuclear weapons under  the control of  ground forces of the United States, and we  .  27809  no longer deploy tactical nuclear weapons at  sea.  At the same time, we've taken all our stra tegic bombers off day-to-day alert. We've re duced our total active stockpile of nuclear  weapons by almost 60 percent-with a goal of  almost 80 percent by 2003. We've made sig nificant  reductions  in  our  conventional  forces as well. These are remarkable changes  in capabilities--capabilities that were once  critical to deterrence, but are now of lesser  value. The world has changed. One  thing  that won't change, though, is this: at some  time and place in the future we'll have to  support diplomacy with force.  History  teaches us  this inevitability. We  don't know where, we can't predict accu rately when; but on one thing, I'll give a stiff  wager. The United States will again commit  its young sons and daughters to conflict; and  much as we might hope that conflict will be  the sterile, precise, video-game, hi-tech, low  or no casualty conflict some ""silver bullet""  strategists would like, it will, unfortunately,  involve  infantry, and mud, and rifles, and  casual ties.  And that brings me to the heart of what I  want to say tonight. Readiness--the core of  our military  effectiveness,  is  people. We  fought and won Desert Storm-magnificent  victory by any standard-with a force that  many of you in this room helped conceive  and plan-a force that, to paraphrase general  Schwarzkopf, could have swapped equipment  with the Iraquis and still beat them. Why?  Because it's the people, not the equipment it's not the tanks--it's not the aircraft-it's  not the ships-instead, it's the pilot, it's the  infantryman, it's the tanker, it's the sailor the man or woman who remains the key ele ment of the equation.  1\s all of you know, that is not a force that  represents a  cross-section of America-in stead, as an all-volunteer force, it's a force  that represents something better-our finest  vision of national service and self-sacrifice.  The quality of our people today is very high,  by any standard you care  to measure us  with-in the number of high school grad uates we recruit, in the number of enlisted  men and women who earn their undergradu ate degrees while in the service, in the fact  that we have a drug free environment-con sider that. And while we may recruit with a  variety of economic incentives, it's not just  money that motivates the men and women  who stand in our ranks.  This isn't just another job. An excellent  editorial that appeared this week described  their motivation in this way:  Those who bear arms in the Nation's de fense know and feel mysteries beyond  the  reach of those who do not* * *  Members of the Order of the World Wars and your guests tonight-you know what I'm  talking about.  So  I  think  that while  the weapons are  going to change-and our potential adversar ies are only going to get smarter and tough er-our success will remain directly related  to our ability to continue to put the very  best America has  to offer  into our ranks.  We're on the razor's edge on this issue-our  forces are being ridden hard and put away  wet.  Here's an example from the Marine Corps:  Tonight, Marines are, of course, in Haiti and  in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba-but we're also in  the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean with 2,000  Marines; offshore Mogadishu; and ashore in  Kenya with Marine aircraft supporting our  operations in Rwanda * * * while other Ma rine forces operate in the Mediterranean and  in Avlano, Italy, with an F-18 squadron in  ",1994
261,House,103,0.384,516,20,Ms. DUNN.," Mr. Speaker, last week,  several on the other side tried to make  football analogies  regarding  the con tract with America. Not surprisingly  these comparisons were  a  few yards  short of a first down.  For the past 40 years, the Democrats  have had the ball, they have controlled  the clock, they have rammed their lib eral agenda  through  the  line despite  the crowd of Americans roaring against  them.  The Democrats  are  nervous  now.  After a series of Democrat fumbles and  penalties, the Republicans are going on  the offense.  But today, we are merely drawing up  our game plan: The Republicans' con tract with America. Our strategy in cludes applying the rules of the game  to  Congress,  a  very  popular move  among the crowd of Americans whose  pleas have gone unanswered  for  too  long.  When we finally get our hands on the  ball, we will be ready. All those Repub licans who have been  forced  by  the  Democrats to sit on the bench will fi nally get in the game.  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND  OUR CONTRACT  (Mr. KNOLLENBERG asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1994
262,House,103,0.366,516,20,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker,  we are in the midst of a social crisis.  Illegitimacy  rates  are  exploding.  Crime rates are rising. Our cities are  decaying,  and millions of Americans  are trapped in poverty.  Last week, more  than  300 Repub licans signed a historic agreement  to  reverse these trends. The Personal Re sponsibility Act is a key element of our  contract with America.  Drawing upon the lessons of the last  30 years, we have pledged to reform a  welfare system  that deprives  individ uals  from  obtaining  the American  dream.  Real welfare reform means spending  less  and moving dependents  off  the  dole. Our plan will instill responsibil ity by requiring work for benefits. We  will strengthen the family by eliminat ing subsidies for out-of-wedlock births.  And we will provide the American tax payer with relief by cutting runaway  welfare spending.  Mr. Speaker, the American people re alize  that we  can no  longer punish  what is right in America to subsidize  what is wrong with America.  The Republican contract with Amer ica provides real and effective welfare  reform, and I am confident that on No vember 8,  the American people will  voice their support for the principles of  this pact.

263,House,103,0.284,516,20,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, these artifi cial  flowers  are  the  latest  evidence  that goods made with slave  labor  in  Chinese prison camps are making their  way into the United States. The proof  is in the label and the story is docu mented  in  the  latest  report by my  friend Harry Wu. It was also the sub ject of a report aired on ABC news last  night.  I am submitting  this and an other report on export of slave-labor grown green tea for the RECORD.  The  labels were  smuggled  out  of  China by a courageous prisoner named  Chen Pokong. I want to quote from a  six-page appeal he sent  to  the  inter national community:  I  am  thrown  into  this hell because  the  Guangdong authorities want  to crush me  physically and spiritually.  I  strongly urge  * * * the world * * * to pay close attention  to human rights conditions in China, and to  extend their assistance to the Chinese people  who are in an abyss of misery. I understand  that once my letter is published, I might be  persecuted even more harshly. I might even  be killed. But I have no choice.  These  flowers were purchased at a  popular craft retail store in the United  States. Importing slave labor goods is  illegal.  Last  spring President Clinton cer tified  that  the People's Republic  of  China is complying with the memoran dum of understanding for slave  labor  goods signed in 1992. This new evidence  makes me wonder if the administration  is doing all it can to enforce it.  Mr. Speaker, thin man risked his life  to bring us this information. The U.S.  Government has an obligation to make  sure Chen Pokong is not harmed.  ",1994

265,House,103,0.551,542,20,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong opposition to H.R. 5044.  By allowing the Secretary of the In terior  to  impose  land-use restrictions  on private property within  these des ignated heritage areas without provid ing any compensation to  the affected  property owners,  this bill will lead to  more abuses in the historic preserva tion process.  I cannot understand why we are giv ing more  control  to  a  department  where one of its own historic preserva tion officials said:  * * * the greatest threats to historic prop erties, natural resources, scenic values. and  national parks come not from Federal agen cies but from private parties, doing private  things on private lands.  In my  own  congressional  district,  this way of thinking is being used over  the overwhelming opposition of sur rounding counties to declare an entire  mountain a historic district. Based on  claims  that it is of religious signifi cance  to American Indian  tribes,  the  keeper of the National Register of His toric Places has decided  to designate  235 square miles and over 1,000 private  parcels of land as a historic district.  The area in question, better known  as Mount Shasta, contains no physical  evidence  of  the  activities  that  are  being designated as historic. The rea son  for  the designation,  I believe,  is  primarily  to halt economic develop ment in the community.  Mr. Chairman,  this bill  is  just an other Trojan horse to restrict more of  our private property rights. Vote ""no""  on  this bill and on any amendments  that further weaken private property  rights. Finally, I urge your ""aye"" vote  on  the  Tauzin-Grams  amendment  which provides private property assur ances.  ",1994

Mr. Chairman,  someone alluded  to  the fact that they supported the Taylor  amendment  to  the biological  survey  to  the  gen yield  bill, but they do not want to support  this Tauzin amendment for landowner  consent. We should all ask, why not?  The Taylor amendment, which passed  291 and later on by 325 votes, simply  said that a person had to get landowner  consent before Federal and State Gov ernment  agents walked  onto  their  property.  What we are  talking about here  is  not them walking onto it and visiting  it, checking it out. We are talking here  about  them regulating  it. Should we  not want landowner consent here?  If we want landowner consent before  they can come visit a person and look  at their property, would we not want  landowner consent before they came to  take it away?  ",1994

(b) NO CONDITIONING OF APPROVAL AND AS SISTANCE.-Limitations on fishing, hunting,  or trapping may not be made a condition for  the approval of a compact or management  plan, the provision of assistance for early ac tions pursuant to section 106  (a)(4),  the de termination of eligibility for Federal funds,  or the receipt, in connection with the Amer ican Heritage Area status of an area, of any  other form of assistance from the Secretary  or other Federal agencies.  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska  (during  the  reading). Mr. Chairman,  I ask unani mous consent that the amendment be  considered as read and printed in the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN.

273,House,103,-0.291,633,20,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to ask my colleagues to support  this  rule. The world economy has reached  an  historic  juncture. The  economic  interdependence of countries  through out the world has grown dramatically.  The old GATT rules, if not modernized  and  expanded,  will  soon  be  over whelmed.  The new GATT agreement addresses  the emerging trade issues of the future  and readies us for the twenty-first cen tury. Once in place, the new rules will  lead to a vast expansion in world trade.  I wish we were voting tonight to rat ify the agreement as well as the rule.  Washington State has embraced the  opportunities  international  trade  of fers.  It is  the most  trade dependent  State  in  the Nation. The  result has  been $28 billion in exports and 600,000  jobs-more than one out of every five  jobs in the State.  The computer software and aerospace  industries in my State,  in particular,  will  greatly  benefit  from  the  new  GATT  rules  protecting  intellectual  property rights and controlling unfair  trade practices.  Yearly losses from piracy of U.S. in tellectual property are estimated to be  a staggering $12 billion. The new GATT  agreement will finally give U.S. copy right and patent holders a means to en force and capitalize upon their legiti mate  intellectual  property  rights  throughout the world.  The  new GATT  agreement  is  the  right agreement for my State and the  right agreement for America.  I urge my colleagues to support the  rule tonight.  ",1994

275,House,103,0.402,633,20,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, I am  normally very supportive of all of the  issues that the gentleman from Califor nia  [Mr. DREIER]  brings before  this  body.  As a free-trader, I must speak out in  strong opposition to this rule, because  I think it is plain unconscionable that  we bring this back in a lame-duck ses sion. This important legislation should  not be decided by Members who have  no political stake in the outcome.  ",1994
276,House,103,-0.404,633,20,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule.  If this GATT becomes  law,  it will  produce an additional $100 billion-$200  billion worth of additional GDP to the  American economy on an annual basis.  The GATT can basically be divided  into four areas. First of all, it is a con tinuation of the existing world  trade  treaty that determines rules on goods  and services that cross borders in the  world today that has actually given a  great rise in the world standard of liv ing over the last 50 years since the end  of World War II.  First,  this new GATT will  expand  protection  in  the  intellectual  prop erties. As  you know, when  software  goes across U.S. borders into countries  right now, we do not have adequate  protection of software and intellectual  property. China, for example, steals $1  ",1994
277,House,103,-0.262,646,20,Mr. TORRICELLI.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York [Mr. ENGEL].  ",1994
278,House,103,-0.408,646,20,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Chairman, I have al ways believed,  and  I have  said  this  many, many times, as a member of the  House Committee on Foreign Affairs,  that foreign policy ought to be biparti san, and I do not believe we ought to  use serious events in foreign policy to  bash the President. I believe when the  President is right, he is our President,  and ought to be supported.  During the Persian Gulf war, I broke  with my party and supported President  Bush, because I felt that he was right,  and let me just say I think we need to  give credit where credit is due. Presi dent Clinton sent envoys  to Port-au Prince. They negotiated a settlement.  As a result, our troops occupied Haiti  without  having  to  shoot  their way  through and, indeed, we have seen dur ing the course of events that the Hai tian people have welcomed our troops  and that the President really has done  a good job here.  Now,  I wish that the President had  come to Congress prior to sending the  troops  to Haiti, because I  think that  Congress does have ultimate authority  in making these decisions. But the fact  of the matter is that right now we are  faced with  the fact  that we do have  troops in Haiti who are performing a  mission  and who,  so  far,  have  per formed it very admirably, and the mis sion has been successful.  I  think  it  is very, very  important  that Congress  now  authorizies  that  mission, and that is what H.J. Res. 416  is doing. I think that it is very impor tant to have this resolution. We can de bate  the merits of it. We can debate  whether or not the March 1 deadline is  something that ought to be there, and  quite  frankly,  I  have  some  doubts  about  that, because  I  think  that we  have gone into Haiti to do a  job, and  we ought to do the job, we want to get  out as soon as possible, but I  think  that we need to stay until the  job is  done.  I believe that we do have vital inter ests  in Haiti. Ask anybody  in south  Florida, ask anybody who has looked  at our immigration policies that have  fallen apart. We understand that when  Haitian boat people come to this coun try trying to get into this country to  flee  tyranny and oppression  in  their  country  that certainly we do have a  vital  interest  in who  comes  to  our  shore.  This is not something that is on the  other side of the world. This  is very  close to us in our own Western Hemi sphere, and what goes on in Haiti cer tainly affects us here  in  the United  States.  Let me say to my colleagues that I  think in some quarters of this Congress  there is a dangerous attitude of isola tionism, and while  it might be very  nice to say we have pressing problems  at home, and we should take care of  those problems first, and I do agree, I  think as a  superpower, we certainly  have an interest in what goes on in the  rest of the world, particularly when it  is  in our hemisphere  right here at  home.  I do not think we should cut and run  or pass resolutions that say we made a  mistake or the President made a mis take. I do not think the thing here is  to score political brownie points. The  thing here is to say we have our troops  in Haiti who are doing a job, who have  done it admirably; we support them; we  want to continue the mission ~nd then  get out. That is what H.J. Res. 416 pro vides,  continue  the mission and get  out, authorize  the U.S.  operation  in  Haiti,  sets  the  limited  presence  in  Haiti, provides for a  resolution,  if we  need to stay beyond March 1.  I think  that what  this Congress ought  to do  now is responsibly, in a bipartisan ap proach, support our forces in Haiti and  say that we have a job to do, and when  that job is completed we ought to get  out.  I think that is in the best tradition  of bipartisan foreign policy that Con gress has done through the years, and I  think that is what we ought to do now.  Let me  again  say  the  President  should have come to Congress first, but  let us also give credit where credit is  due. The operation has been a success.  It is continuing to be a success. This  Congress needs to support our troops in  Haiti.  I will certainly support H.J. Res. 416,  and will look at any amendments, and  I commend  the gentleman from New  Jersey, my  friend,  for putting  forth  this resolution.  ",1994

299,,103,0.402,685,20,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a place  I have called home for nearly  three decades-the city of Simi Valley, which  this year is celebrating the 25th anniversary of  its incorporation.  Like many other long-time residents,  I was  originally drawn  to  the area  that would be come Simi Valley because of its rural atmos phere  and  reasonable  home  prices. Back  then, Simi Valley was a place where you could  buy more home  than you  thought you could  afford and enjoy a quality of  life you didn't  think was possible so close to a large metro politan city like Los Angeles.  Housing prices have  increased over  the  years as word of Simi Valley spread, but both  new and established  residents  continue  to  enjoy the city's rural atmosphere and Western  flavor. Even as the city has grown-now num bering more than 100,000 people-Simi Valley  has retained its small-town feel and sense of  community.  The city has also had success in building up  its  commercial  and  industrial  base. As  a  former mayor,  I am happy to have been able  to play some small role in Simi Valley's transi tion  from a bedroom community  to one  in  which people can  live, play, work, and shop.  As a  result of  this progress, Simi Valley  today  is a very different place  than  it was  when I moved in nearly 28 years ago. Thank fully, the changes that have come have been  positive and the qualities of the city that peo ple enjoy most have been retained over the  years.  In the face of higher crime rates around the  country, Simi Valley continues  to be a very  safe place to live and to raise a family. It con tinues to be a physically beautiful place, a pic turesque valley surrounded by scenic moun tains. And  it continues  to be a place where  you not only know your neighbors, you con sider them friends.  With  the  recent opening  of  the Ronald  Reagan Presidential Library, Simi Valley has  become a destination point  for both  tourists  from across the Nation and some of the lead ing figures from the political world.  When this wide variety of visitors converge  on Simi Valley they will recognize what long time residents already know,  that this city  in  eastern Ventura County-now 25 years old has made dramatic progress over its short his tory while still retaining the qualities that make  ",1994
300,,103,-0.272,698,20,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my  best wishes and congratulations to President  Lee T eng-hui and Ambassador Benjamin Lu of  the Republic of China on the occasion of T ai wan's 83d National Day on October 1 0, 1994.  In recent weeks, we have seen the Republic  of China's campaign to rejoin the United Na tions.  I believe we should give Taiwan our  support.  The Republic of China is a full-fledged de mocracy and its government policies conform  to those of other democratic nations.  The Republic of China is one of the most  important economic powers in the world. De spite its small population of 21 million people,  its gross national product ranks among the 20  largest in the world and its foreign reserve is  one of the biggest in the world.  The Republic of China has established a  program of economic assistance to many unOctober 5, 1994  derdeveloped nations and has  joined major  international  organizations  such  as  the  APEC-the Asian Pacific Economic Coopera tion forum.  One of the most compelling reasons for us  to support the Republic of China's aspiration  for United Nations membership is Taipei's will ingness  to be a helpful partner in  the  inter national community.  In closing,  I wish to take this opportunity to  say my personal  goodbye  to Ambassador  Mou-shih Ding, who has returned to Taipei to  assume the post Secretary-General of the Re public of China's National Security Council.  I  look  forward  to working closely with Ambas sador Ding's  successor, Ambassador Ben jamin Lu.  God bless the Republic of China on Taiwan.  TRIBUTE TO THE REPUBLIC OF  CHINA AND THE UNITED NATIONS  HON. LUCIEN E. BLACKWELL  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 5, 1994  ",1994
301,,103,-0.538,698,20,Mr. BLACKWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate  the Republic of China on  its  forthcoming  83d  anniversary.  I  commend  President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President  Li  Yuan-zu, Premier Lien Chan and Foreign Min 'ister Frederick Chien for their diligent efforts in  campaigning  for the return of this country to  the United Nations.  I am certain  that many  would agree that this country is deserving of  such membership.  The Republic of China on Taiwan has been  in  total control over  the Taiwan area  from  1945 to the present. It governs 21 million Chi nese  on  the  island. Mr. Speaker,  I was  pleased  to  learn  that  the Republic of China  has declared  that  its political authority does  not extend over  the Chinese mainland and  that it looks forward to a peaceful settlement  on the issue of reunification with the mainland.  No doubt,  the Republic of China should  have a  reasonable  international status and  should be able  to participate  in U.N.-spon sored activities. Mr. Speaker, such exclusion  from the United Nations leaves the rights and  interests of 21 million Chinese citizens unpro tected.  All nations  large and small should enjoy  membership with  the United Nations. Mr.  Speaker,  I hope  to see  the day,  real soon,  when the Republic of Taiwan will once again  be a proud member of the United Nations.

304,House,103,-0.216,1088,20,Mr. MANN.," Mr. Chairman,  I rise  today  in  support of  the Dellums-Murtha substitute  to  House Joint Resolution 416. As a former naval  officer, who served during the Cuban missile  crisis,  I have  firsthand experience of military  operations in the Caribbean. Therefore, I take  seriously the responsibility of placing the men  and women of  the U.S. Armed Forces  in  harm's way.  Had President Kennedy  been  schackled  with a date certain  for the termination of the  Cuban quarantine,  the Soviet Union would  have  successfully  put  nuclear missiles  in  Cuba.  Our senior military leaders like Joint Chiefs  of Staff Chairman, General Shalikashvili; JCS  Director of Operations, General Sheehan; and  former JCS Chairman Colin Powell have told  us that we place our troops at risk by impos ing a date certain.  It seems  irrational to me  that we would  then  impose a date certain,  which is little more than a political solution to  this military operation. U.S. troops should not  be pawns in the debate between the  legisla tive and executive branches of Government.  The plan we have before us in the Dellums  substitute requires the administration to define  the mission,  identify  the costs, estimate  the  duration of United States presence  in Haiti  with monthly  reports  to Congress. This sub stitute supports our troops without giving con gressional approval  to  their deployment and  without jeopardizing them with a date certain.  I see this as the best means to successfully  completing the mission in Haiti.  I know  that  is  this partisan environment  some who have never served their country in  the military will criticize those of us who refuse  to  jeopardize our  troops  for political  gain.  While  I disagreed with  the decision  to  intro duced troops  into Haiti without congressional  approval, now  that  they are  there we must  give them our full and unequivocal support.  I  urge  adoption of  the Dellums-Murtha  sub stitute.  ",1994
305,House,103,-0.246,1088,20,Ms. SHEPHERD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in  support of  the Dellums-Murtha-Hastings Dicks substitute to support our troops in Haiti.  Now,  I did not support a United States inva sion  in Haiti.  I  joined with Representative  SKAGGS  and Representative BOEHLERT and  137 other Members of the House in sending a  letter to President Clinton in July calling upon  him to gain congressional approval before initi ating an invasion of Haiti. I also joined 1 05 of  you in cosponsoring House Concurrent Reso lution 276, stating  that ""the President  is  re quired to obtain prior approval of the Congress  before United States Armed Forces may un dertake offensive military action against-the  military leadership of Haiti.""  Fortunately, the last-minute diplomatic initia tive by  former President Carter,  former Joint  Chief of Staff Colin Powell, and Senator SAM  NUNN averted a bloody invasion, and for that  I am deeply grateful. While I still have reserva tions about our Haiti policy, particularly about  the wisdom of putting American troops at risk,  I am cautiously optimistic about the course of  events in Haiti. Our troops have fulfilled their  mission with professionalism and compassion.  and  in the areas where United States troops  are present, Haitians are once again able to  express their political opinions without fear of  death or torture. Our forces have dismantled  the Haitian military's heavy weapons and have  begun to collect guns from the Haitian policy  and paramilitary groups, which will make  it  more difficult for antidemocratic forces to ter rorize the population in the future.  The United States does have a direct na tional  interest  in  the outcome of  the power  struggle in Haiti. If the people of Haiti feel that  their political and economic situation offers  them  no  hope,  they will  flood  the United  States as refugees.  It will be far better if we  can help  them arrive at a political solution  which will  restore democratic rule and give  them a chance  to  rebuild  their country. The  gradual  lifting  of  sanctions  announced  by  President Clinton should help  restore hope  and create a viable economy in Haiti. Already,  Haitian  refugees  are  returning  home  from  Guantanamo Bay.  United States troops have now created the  conditions(jto allow for  the peaceful return of  the democratic Government of Haiti. However,  it  looks as  though an  international presence  will be needed in Haiti through the Presidential  elections  scheduled  for  September  1995.  Therefore, I believe that we should push for a  rapid  transfer of  responsibility  to  the United  Nations. The urgent need now  is  for police,  not combat  troops, and  the United Nations  should be able to capably handle this mission.  However, I oppose an arbitrary deadline for  withdrawal from Haiti. Our Nation's top military  leaders have been down here begging us not  to tie their hands, to let them fulfill their mis sion. As  long as  those who would  threaten  both our troops and democracy in Haiti are not  sure when United States troops will leave, we  will retain an important psychological and mili tary advantage. Setting a date certain only en courages the opponents of democracy to dig  in and wait us out. We should not give them  ",1994
306,House,103,-0.262,1101,20,Ms. HARMAN.," Mr. Chairman, today we face  a tough series of votes on the United States  presence in Haiti.  In deciding what to do, I have weighed the  options against a three-fold set of consider ations.  First and foremost in my mind is guarantee ing the safety of U.S.  troops in Haiti. As the  mother of  two draft-age children, my heart  goes out  to other parents whose sons and  daughters may be at risk. I pledge to do all  in  my power as a member of the House Armed  Services Committee  to  protect  your  loved  ones.  A second major consideration is the appro priateness of unilateral U.S. military presence.  I was not  in  favor of committing  troops  to  Haiti-and the great majority of my constitu ents opposed it. I jointed 117 of my colleagues  in signing a resolution calling for a debate on  our Haitian policy.  I did not and do not feel  that  a military  option was  necessary  to  achieve the restoration of democracy. Rather,  I would have tried longer to use and enforce  ",1994
307,House,103,-0.491,1114,20,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman  I rise  today  in  support of the Dellums-Murtha-Hastings-Dicks  amendment, which urges  the withdrawal of  United States  troops  from Haiti  in a prompt  and orderly  fashion,  as  soon as possible.  President Clinton is to be commended for his  leadership in pursuing additional diplomatic ef forts to avoid bloodshed.  I join with those who believe that we have  a real national  interest  in promoting democ racy and human  rights  in Haiti. Peace and  prosperity in our hemisphere is a very real na tional  security  issue. The  restoration  of a  democratically-elected government in our own  backyard will  send a message  to despots  around the world and help to stop the flow of  refugees to our shores.  While it is in our national interest to promote  democracy and human rights  in Haiti,  it  is  in  the  interest of the  lives of our young people  now serving there that we act responsibly and  sensibly in our policy.  I support the Dellums Murtha amendment because I believe that we  should withdraw our troops as soon as pos sible.  I also believe, however,  that setting a  date certain for troop withdrawal would unnec essarily endanger both our  troops  on  the  ground and our efforts at promoting democ racy in Haiti.  As many of my colleagues know, I generally  do not support the use of force because I truly  believe  that negotiated solutions  lead  to a  stronger and more lasting peace. That is why  I opposed an  invasion of Haiti.  I do believe  that the presence. of United States troops  in  Haiti has made a positive difference. The vio lence and human  rights abuses have been  curtailed;  the Parliament  is  reestablishing  it self;  the Haitian military  and  para-military  forces are being brought under control.  If we  in Congress demand  today  that our  troops  leave Haiti by a specific date,  it will shift the  momentum of change and start another wait ing-game. Haiti's military leaders will know that  all they have to do in order to regain control  is wait for the United States to leave.  Mr. Chairman,  I would like to go on record  with several of my reservations regarding the  current United States policy toward Haiti. First,  I believe that President Clinton had a Constitu tional obligation  to  seek Congressional ap proval before deploying United States  troops  to Haiti. Neither the relationship between the  Executive and Legislative branches nor  the  President's  policy  toward Haiti were well served by the manner in which the Administra tion proceeded.  Second, however pleased we all were  to  have avoided an invasion, the deal made by  the Carter delegation  to  resolve  this conflict  should not serve as a model  for future deal ings with brutal dictators.  In addressing  the  nation on Haiti, President Clinton character ized the Haitian regime as the ""most violent in  our hemisphere,"" and cited their atrocities, in cluding the execution of children, as justifica tion for the invasion of Haiti. President Carter  and Colin Powell characterized  these same  men as ""honorable."" The barbarous junta suc ceeded in being treated with respect and their  brutal actions may ultimately go unpunished.  We must make  it clear  to all who brutalize  their people that they will answer for their ac tions in an international court of law.  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our young peo ple serving in Haiti and for the sake of those  who are struggling  for democratic  reform  in  Haiti, I urge my colleagues to reject attempts  to  legislate an arbitrary deadline  for  the  re moval of our troops and to support a prompt  and orderly withdrawal at the soonest possible  time.  ",1994
308,House,103,-0.362,1140,20,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Chairman, the  Torricelli-Hamilton resolution accom plishes  these  important objectives: It  sets our exit from Haiti for March 1,  1995.  It gives our Armed Forces  the  time necessary to complete their mis sion, avoiding  the concerns military  experts have  expressed about under mmmg our  troops  and  it makes  a  strong constitutional statement about  Congress's role in such actions.  Because of the hand  that has been  dealt us due to previous congressional  inaction on this issue, Torricelli-Ham ilton is the most responsible course of  action.  It expresses  the will of  the  American  people,  and  protects  our  Armed Forces.  I opposed  the previous amendments  because I believe in the following prop osition.  If we pass a resolution that does not  include a date for withdrawal, then we  will  have,  in  effect,  abdicated  Congress's constitutional power to de clare war, and assumed the responsibil ities of the consequences.  This debate would be unnecessary if  we would have  the courage  to assert  our constitutional  responsibility and  statutory  authority  under  the War  Powers Act.  To those who claim that establishing  a date for withdrawal can put the lives  of the valiant men and women of our  armed forces at risk, I suggest that our  failure  to pursue our constitutional  and statutory authority under the War  Powers Act does the same. That is why  I  believe  the  Torricelli-Hamilton  amendment  is  the best avenue avail able  to us. Establishing March 1 as a  date  in which  authorization  ceases,  preserves congressional authority and  best protects our troops.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Torricelli-Hamilton resolution.  ",1994
309,House,103,0.231,1140,20,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Chairman, re member, when Members vote on  the  Torricelli amendment,  it  is a  retro active authorization of an  ill-advised  incursion into Haiti to install a presi dent who will  surely embarrass  the  United States. It will bring us casual ties. Setting a date certain, as it does,  for withdrawing is potentially a very  disastrous course. The withdrawal date  becomes a timetable for each faction in  Haiti to seek to exploit.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  distinguished  chairman says it is the responsibility  of the Congress to authorize the use of  our armed forces in Haiti. Indeed, Mr.  Chairman,  the  President  has  acted  without  the support of the Congress,  and without the support of. the Amer ican people.  However, this Congress has a higher  duty, and that is to serve as a check on  the President when he is wrong; to say,  ""No,  bring  the  troops home."" Vote  against the Torricelli amendment.

Warm  congratulations  are  in  order, Mr.  Speaker, for the dedicated parishioners of St.  Martin's Episcopal Church. Mr. Speaker, on  January 31,  1982, 57 people gathered  to gether and began the long and arduous proc ess of forming their own church. Their dedica tion and perseverance  is about  to  be  re warded, because on Friday, October 7, St.  Martin's will  become a  full  fledged  parish  church in the Diocese of southwest Florida.  The members of St. Martins's plan a Parish wide party on Sunday, October 9, where they  will give  thanks and properly celebrate  this  long-awaited event.  Mr. Speaker, words alone are unable  to  convey the depth of my pride and happiness  for  the members of St. Martin's Episcopal  Church. Their action speaks volumes about  the American spirit. Their commitment,  inde pendence and strong faith in God carried them  through  the years  it  took  to reach  this goal,  especially during  the  inevitable days when  doubt raised its ugly head.  The light at the end of the tunnel may have  been faint sometimes, but the members of St.  Martin's never gave up, never  looked back.  With the power of God's love in their hearts,  they pressed on. On  the eve of their goal,  I  ant them to know that their stunning achieve ment inspires us and gives us all a sense of  hope for the  future of the world our children  will inherit.

Today,  I  rise to pay tribute to PBS and its 346 member  stations across  this country. Together  they  have produced an unparalleled tradition of ex cellence in television programming.  PBS maintains a unique position as an inde pendent, noncommercial organization owned  and directed by  its member stations. Unlike  other networks which depend on advertisers'  funding to support programming, PBS remains  reliant on donations  from viewers, corporate  sponsors,  and  to a small degree, Federal  funding  through  the Corporation  for Public  Broadcasting.  ",1994
316,,103,0.259,1257,20,Mr. FRANKS of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  the debate over health care reform has under standably focused on what is wrong with our  current system. While  I agree that there are  numerous aspects that need improvement, we  should be careful not to destroy the innovative  spirit of a system that has provided our Nation  with the finest quality health care in the world.  Despite  its  flaws,  the current system has  fostered an environment that has  led  to  the  development of revolutionary new drugs. And  one of America's most  innovative  industries,  pharmaceutical companies have been the en gine of medical progress for decades. Count less discoveries of life-saving drugs and cures  for deadly diseases have been the direct re sult of the pharmaceutical industry's efforts.  To this end,  I would  like to share with my  colleagues the miraculous discovery of a drug,  Sandimmune, which enables transplant recipi ents  to  resume  normal  lives.  In  fact,  Sandimmune  has  transformed organ  trans plants from a medical experiment to a widely  accepted medical  therapy. Prior  to  the  intro duction of Sandimmune in 1982, organ trans plants were  relatively  rare. Today, however,  Sandimmune is used  in over 120,000 kidney  transplants annually.  Testament  to  the drugs  invaluable  impact  are  the  stories of  three  young Americans  whose  lives were  forever changed by  treat ment with a  therapeutic drug, Sandimmune.  Writing  to  its manufacturer, Sandoz Corp.,  they described what Sandimmune has meant  to them.  Joe Canze  from Owosso, Ml,  a  kidney  transplant recipient, writes, ""I love basketball!  If you asked me what I would like to do for a  day, it would be to shoot baskets.  I have al ways dreamed about playing  in a  three on  three basketball tournament.""  ""Before my transplant February 19, 1987, I  couldn't play in a three on  three tournament.  I was on a pac-X cycler for twelve hours every  night. Some days when I got off the machine  I felt pretty weak. Also my dialysis tube was  hindering my jumping.""  ""Two years after my transplant I played  in  my first tournament. My team, 'The Fearsome  Foursome' didn't win but we played  three  games and got a  free  tee shirt. The courts  were awesome!""  , ""It was great to finally be on the court not  on the sidelines watching.""  The second story  is by Kim Kaminski,  the  mother of a child who received a heart trans plant.  ""Our  first baby was born with a  fatal  heart defect. Our dreams were crushed. With  a miracle  from God,  the Gift of Kalie's new  heart was received. We were able to celebrate  Kalie's first birthday with  family,  friends, and  the entire community. Kalie's touched so many  hearts and gave inspiration and meaning to all  our lives.""  ""We  thank God and modern medicine  for  our happiness, hopes and dreams and to a fu ture of special moments we'll cherish.""  Kristopher Brown  of Stanley, WI writes,  ""Doctors say it's a miracle I am alive. My ~ife  28719  has changed since  I received my new heart  one year ago.  I can play my all time favorite  sport, football. If I am lucky I would be a quar terback. When I am on my Aunt's four wheel er,  I can be wild and  free.  If dreams come  true,  I'll own my own someday. Thanks  to  Sandimmune I have a second chance to be a  teenager and enjoy life.""  These real life experiences are what is right  with our health care system.  In recent years,  pharmaceutical companies, many of which are  located  in my home State of New Jersey,  have  developed  a wide  variety  of break through drugs that are saving countless thou sands of lives every year. We must make cer tain that this industry is not handcuffed in their  efforts to develop more miracle cures for dis eases like AIDS, cancer and heart disease.  ADDRESS  BY  MRS.

(Dorothy Thompson) Wil liams, the national chairman of the program of  the DAR.  Mrs. Williams was introduced by Mrs. Jerido  Ward,  regent of  the Georgia State Society.  The subject of Mrs. William's address is most  timely as America memorializes the 50th anni versary of the close of World War II. She de veloped her speech, ""The Georgia Daughters  and How They Helped Bear the Burden of a  Nation at War,"" to involve the dedication of all  women of the Society of the Daughters of the  American Revolution in the war effort.  Because  the accompanying address  is a  wonderful tribute to all those patriotic women  of World War II who followed in the footsteps  of their ancestors of the American Revolution,  I ask to place in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the  introduction and the text of her message  so a permanent record may be preserved of  the unselfish part women once again played in  making the world safe for democracy.

319,,103,0.231,1270,20,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, this Member  commends to his colleagues an editorial which  appeared in the Norfolk Daily News on Octo ber 6, 1994. This is an excellent and percep tive common sense editorial with which  this  Member agrees. This represents not only an  editorial point of view, but it also reflects the  sentiment  that has been  conveyed  to  this  Member time and again  in constituent letters  and during town hall meetings in the  last 12  months since President Clinton unveiled his  health care reform proposal. This editorial  il lustrates that in America's heartland, there  is  a strong belief that bigger government will not  solve our Nation's health care problems.  [From the Norfolk Daily News, Oct. 6, 1994]  GoOD RIDDANCE  Changes  in  providing  and  financing  of  health care in America are needed; ""reform""  October 6, 1994  of the sort outlined in President Clinton's  complex, 1,342-page plan is not.  So the lengthy debate produced one satis factory result, though Senate Majority Lead er George Mitchell and Hillary Rodham Clin ton, among others, are lamenting the out come. It indicated what people do not want.  Consequently, a lot of costly mistakes are  being avoided because there was no consen sus and there will be no further action this  session on health care.  Prospects for important legislation seemed  good at the outset. The President controlled  both houses of Congress. He had given health  care legislation his No. 1 priority. Polls ini tially indicated 60 percent of the American  people supporting him on the subject. Media  support for the Clinton plan or variations of  it were significant.  President Clinton worked hard in behalf of  the plan, and even agreed to abandon much  of it in order  to  seek compromises  that  might be acceptable. The problem was that  neither Americans generally nor a sufficient  majority of members of Congress were will ing to concede that, when it comes to health  care, Washington is capable of devising an  all-inclusive  plan which would  solve  the  complex problems  involving  the way it is  provided, where and by whom it is provided  and how costs are to be met.  A ""national plan"" for health care was at tempted, in much the same way that one for  Social Security was set forth in the 1930s. It  proved to be a much more difficult task, and  less readily accepted by the public because  the federal government has proven much bet ter at making promises of benefits than of  controlling costs and keeping taxes afford able.  Big Government lost the health care battle  this year. It should continue to lose. Ameri cans will be much better served by a simpler,  cost-effective system based on free choice,  on private insurance, on recognition in the  tax code that people ought to be able to es tablish their own medical savings accounts.  Mr.  Clinton  raised  voters  expectations  when he campaigned against more intrusive  government  and  emphasized Washington's  limits. His health plan was a contradiction,  and its defeat should therefore not be a sur prise but testimony to how important it is  for a politician to work harder at keeping his  word than finding excuses for exceptions. His  predecessor, Mr. Bush, and his experience  with taxes, should have provided a sufficient  lesson.  TRIBUTE TO CHARLES AND MARY  KEEN  HON.

321,,103,0.176,1283,20,Mr. CLINGER.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  railroads  played a vital role in the dawning of the indus trial age in America, and no other State's his tory and heritage have been enriched more by  the rail industry than Pennsylvania's.  During  the  late 1800's and early 1900's,  hundreds of miles of railroad tracks stretched  across Pennsylvania, allowing merchants  to  ship freight and  transport passengers  in and  out of the State. The birth of mass production  in America created enormous demands  for  Pennsylvania coal,  iron, and steel, and these  industries  relied heavily on  the  railroad net work to move their goods to manufacturers in  St. Louis, Chicago, New York, and other areas  of the country.  Aside  from serving as the  lifeline of Penn sylvania commerce, the rail industry employed  thousands of hard-working Pennsylvanians as  engineers, operators, mechanics, and railyard  workers. Many employees were immigrants or  first-and second-generation Americans whose  parents and grandparents  left England,  Ire land, Germany, or Eastern Europe  in search  of opportunity and prosperity.  Working  for  the  railroad was not always  easy or pleasant. Pennsylvania  railroad em ployees toiled through the high times and eco nomic growth of the Industrial Revolution; en dured  the bitter clashes between  labor and  management; and witnessed the decline of the  rail  industry as automobiles, highways, and  other  technological advances provided alter native modes of transportation.  Today, thousands of railroad employees, re tirees, and their families still live in Pennsylva nia. Over  the past year,  I've heard  from a  great number of them  in my district who are  worried the railroad retirement system will be  dismantled and their hard-earned benefits put  at risk.  Indeed, proposals to eliminate the Railroad  Retirement Board have surfaced a number of  times over  the past several years. Most re28745  cently, Vice President GoRE's National Per formance Review  recommended  eliminating  the Board and  transferring  its  functions  to  other Federal agencies. Under the proposal,  retirement benefits would be administered by  the Social Security Administration, unemploy ment benefits would become the responsibility  of State unemployment agencies, and sick ness benefits would be managed by Medicare.  While I wholeheartedly support the goals of  Vice President GORE's National Performance  Review to make Government work better and  cost less, I fail to see any justification for dis mantling the Board.  I do not believe the pro posal will  increase Government efficiency or  save the American taxpayers money.  The Railroad Retirement Board was estab lished  in 1934 to protect the solvency of rail  industry pension programs during  the Great  Depression. The Board oversees the railroad  retirement system and  its  trust  funds which  are financed by payroll taxes levied on railroad  employers and employees. Over the past 60  years, millions of  railworkers have paid  into  the system with expectations of receiving re tirement, sickness, disability, and survivor ben efits when and if they are needed.  Although  the Clinton administration's  inten tions to eliminate Government waste may be  genuine,  its  recommendation  to dissolve  the  Board is misguided. Since the cost of the rail road retirement system is borne by the rail in dustry, elimination of the Railroad Retirement  Board will not yield any savings for American  taxpayers. Instead, dismantling the railroad re tirement system may only make  it more bur densome for railroad workers and their survi vors to get the benefits they have paid for and  need.  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a reso lution expressing  the sense of the House of  Representatives with respect to preserving the  Railroad Retirement Board and the railroad re tirement system. Realizing the 1 03d Congress  will soon come to a close, I fully intend to re introduce the measure at the beginning of the  1 04th Congress. Nevertheless,  I encourage  my colleagues to demonstrate their support for  railroad workers and  their families by  joining  me as a cosponsor of this resolution.  ",1994
