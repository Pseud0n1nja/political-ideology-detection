0,15,3,Mr. ECKART.,"  The Consumer Rail Equity Act of  1985 will assure that shippers and con sumers who have no alternative  to  transportation on a single railroad are  protected from abusive railroad pric ing practices and assures further that  competition between railroads is maxi mized. In 1980, when the Congress en acted the Staggers Rail Act, railroad  rates for captive shippers-those ship pers without  transportation alterna tives-were not deregulated. The Con gress recognized that captive shippers  were without market alternatives, and,  thus, could not rely on market forces  to discipline  rates. Therefore, Con gress directed the ICC to provide regu latory protection  for  such  shippers  after their rates reached a certain ju risdictional  level which assured that  captive shippers would make a  sub stantially greater contribution to rail road revenue needs than would ship pers with competitive alternatives.  Captive shippers do not complain  about  the basic decisions made by  Congress in 1980. Nonetheless, captive  shippers complain bitterly  that  the  ICC is not providing the protections  required by the Staggers Act-either  because  our  instructions were  not  clear in 1980 or because the Commis sion refuses to accept the need for the  balanced implementation that was en visioned  in Staggers. The result has  often been unreasonably high  rates  being paid to railroads which the ICC  considers to be revenue inadequate al though these same railroads appear to  be financially sound to most observers.  The result has been particularly dif ficult for States like my own which are  in the process of shifting from natural  gas and petroleum as their basic elec tric utility fuel to the use of coal as a  primary fuel. During the mid-1970's,  following the Nation's disastrous crude  oil supply interruption, Federal policy  called for utilities to shift to coal as a  primary fuel and, where possible,  to  low sulfur coal to avoid environmental  problems. As many of our utilities en tered  the coal market for  the first  time in the late 1970's, they encoun tered great difficulty. The experience  of Cajun Electric Power Cooperative,  Inc. is typical of a number of experi ences in my region.  Cajun Electric is a nonprofit rural  electric generation and  transmission  company that provides power to 1 mil lion Louisianans through 13 member  cooperative distribution companies. In  the late 1970's, Cajun, which needed  additional power generation, turned to  Wyoming's Powder River basin,  the  principal source of low sulfur coal in  our  country. Cajun  had  relatively  little difficulty obtaining a competitive  long-term coal contract from the nu merous coal producers  in the basin.  Unfortunately, however, only one rail road, the Burlington Northern [BNJ,  was available to move the coal to Lou isiana.  The Cajun officials recognized their  vulnerability and attempted to negoti ate a  long-term agreement with the  BN, even though the legal authority  of the BN to enter into long-term con tracts was questionable. After receiv ing assurances from the BN and reach ing an agreement pursuant to which  the BN agreed to move the coal from  Wyoming  to Louisiana  for $10.53  a  ton, beginning March 1,  1979, with  only escalation of the rate for infla tion, Cajun executed a long-term coal  contract in the Powder River basin.  Unfortunately, within a year after  March 1, 1979, BN had raised the rate  three times to $12.54 a ton, a 20-per cent increase. From the middle of 1980  to January 1, 1983, the BN increased  its rates six more times to $18.13 a ton.  The nine increases between March l,  1979 and January l, 1983 amounted to  a  total increase of approximately 73  percent. During this same period, in flation adjustments would have yield ed an increase of only about 36 per cent or a rate of approximately $15 in  January 1983.  Until mid-1984, Cajun had no com petitive alternative  to  the BN. Last  year, after years of struggle, the Chi cago  &  Northwestern  Railroad  [ C&NWJ was able  to overcome  the  BN's opposition and obtain an  ICC  order enabling the C&NW to provide  competition  to BN  in part of  the  Powder River basin. Although Cajun's  coal was not in that portion of the  basin, Cajun was finally able, in the  last few months, after threatening to  break its contract, to obtain a contract  for  rail haulage at more reasonable  rates.  Others have. not been so fortunate  and nothing assures that Louisiana's  consumers will be as fortunate with  our future coal needs. Most notably,  the system of law we established in  1980 did not protect Cajun and would  not be protecting Cajun today if they  were still subject to tariff rates. One  additional  factor  that makes  these  rates hard to take is that the justifica tion of ever higher rates for captive  shippers is the need to obtain revenue  adequacy  for our Nation's railroads.  Yet, to most observers, based on the  performance of their stock, their bond  ratings and  their  recent acquisition  history, the BN appears to be revenue  adequate. The  ICC has consistently  determined that the BN is revenue in adequate, however, ever since the en actment of the Staggers Act.  The Consumer Rail Equity Act will  provide protection for the Cajun's of  the world by assuring that the ICC  uses a more accurate revenue adequacy test; by providing that the railroad,  rather than the captive shipper, must  prove  that a  captive shipper's chal lenged rate is reasonable, and by pro viding a more equitable ""rate reason ableness"" test than the test being ap plied by the ICC.  Many of my constituents are en countering a  second problem under  the present  implementation of  the  Staggers Rail Act. Shippers that have  access to two or more rail systems are  protected by marketplace competition  and want nothing more than to retain  their railroad shipping options. Unfor tunately, shipper access to more than  one rail system often depends upon  the railroads willingness and ability to  enter into arrangements that facilitate  competition. Among  these  arrange ments are  the quoting of  joint and  proportional rates,  reciprocal switch ing agreements and arrangements con cerning the use of terminal facilities.  These arrangements have been cus tomary  in  the railroad  industry for  decades.  In the Staggers Act, Congress pro vided the ICC with discretionary au thority to order these arrangements at  reasonable prices when the shippers  could show that these arrangements  were necessary  to preserve and en hance competition. Unfortunately, the  ICC has not been exercising these au thorities, even when shippers made  the requisite showings. The Consumer  Rail Equity Act  assures maximum  competition between the railroads by  making  the  ICC authority  in  these  areas mandatory after  the shippers  make appropriate showings. For those  of us like myself who believe in regula tion by the marketplace, the railroads  cannot have it both ways: They cannot  have both deregulation and reduced  competition.  Finally, the Consumer Rail Equity  Act  addresses  four  other  areas  in  which problems have been  encoun tered under the Staggers Act. The bill  restricts  the ability of  the  ICC  to  exempt rail traffic from regulation in  those instances in which the ICC finds  a lack of railroad ""market dominance""  and makes the ICC exemption author ity discretionary rather than mandato ry. At least two of the recent ICC ex emption actions have been overturned  by the court of appeals.  Second, the bill expands the goals of  the Staggers Act  implementation  to  include the attainment of competitive  transportation rates for both domestic  energy sources and domestically pro duced agricultural commodities. The  ICC  is  required, under both present  and proposed law, to make affirmative  findings  that  captive  shipper  rates  that it finds to be reasonable are con sistent with the achievement of the 15  stated national objectives.  Third,  the  bill  assures  that  the  proper balance is struck between the  ",1985

3,28,3,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the distinguished Congressman from  Maryland  [Mr. HOYER],  for yielding  and commend him  for coordinating  today's special order in support of the  spirit  and defiance  of Soviet  Jews  seeking  emigration  and  justice  at  home even in the face of persecution. I  would also like to extend my apprecia tion to all of our colleagues who have  proposed time to address this impor tant  issue.  I want  to  particularly  thank all  those associated with  the  Anti-Defamation League who helped  me realize the feelings of a struggling,  new nation.  Article I of the Constitution of our  great Nation states thatCongress shall make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  free exercise thereof; or abridging the free dom of speech, or of the press; or the right  of the people peaceably to assemble, and to  petition the Government for a  redress of  grievances.  Fortunately, and we hope and pray  eternally, as citizens of the free socie ty of the United States, we all benefit  from these few lines.  Today, as we stand here, we cannot  possibly deny that we are thankful for  those rights, and we certainly do not  take them for granted. For ,today, we  choose  to  sound  the alarm  to  the  Soviet Union that we stand in defiance  of the persecution, repression, and dis regard for human rights and liberties  which run rampant in that nation's so ciety. Likewise,  today, we choose  to  ally ourselves with those members of  Soviet society who continue to face up  to  those  systematic  attacks,  even  armed with  the knowledge  that the  end result shall only mean personal  tragedy.  My fell ow colleagues, it is true that  there is agonizingly little that we may  hope to do today about the serious de velopments  affecting  Soviet  Jewry.  Perhaps, we convene today only in the  hope  that we will be  recognized as  people who will not ignore the treat ment of Soviet Jews, who will not  stand by quietly while others fight for  fundamental  liberties, who  do  not  sanction the steadily worsening situa tion of anti-Semitism to which we are  now witnesses. We all know about the  desperate  emigration  situation with  which many Soviet Jews are faced-al though approximately 10 percent, or  260,000, of the Soviet Union's Jewish  population left the country between  1968 and 1981, only 896 managed to  get out  last year. Likewise, we are  aware of  the countless others who  have indicated their desire to leave the  Soviet Union by initiating the process  of applying for a visa.  In addition to the problem of emi gration, an even greater threat, anti semitism, has developed. We already  know that Soviet policy affects Jewish  religious practices-teaching  religion  to persons under 18 is illegal, there are  no seminaries in the U .S.S.R. to train  rabbis, and Jewish religious texts and  ritual objects are not produced in the  Soviet Union. We  also  know  that  teaching Hebrew is not recognized by  Soviet authorities as a legitimate pro fession, and  that the  language may  not be taught or studied by Jews, al though it is available to certain non Jewish citizens. Should these facts not  be sufficient enough to impress upon  us the great oppression which many  Soviet Jews must face, the recent wave  of  anti-Jewish  attacks  on Hebrew  teachers  should  serve  as  adequate  proof.  As early as July 26, 1984, the Soviet  crackdown on Jewish cultural activi ties began with the arrest of Moscow  Hebrew  teacher  Aleksandr  Khol miansky on the charges of hooligan ism. Following a search of the home  Kholmiansky shared with his parents,  authorities  elevated  his  charge  to  ""weapons  possession,""  claiming  to  have found a gun and ammunition on  the premises. A close friend of Khol miansky's,  also  a Moscow Hebrew  teacher, Yuliy Edelshtein, was arrest ed after a police search of his apart ment turned up narcotics. On January  29, 1985, a State Department report  revealed that ""there is no reason to  doubt the assertions of close relatives  that  in both cases  the  items were  planted by the police.""  Frankly, it would be easy for me to  stand here  for hours  reiterating a  number of similar stories which reveal  that,  in  fact,  the Soviet Union  is  making a concentrated effort to de stroy the remnants of Jewish educa tion and culture. This is  the funda mental  threat which  such  judicial  action represents. In this case, it is not  only the personal welfare of the indi viduals which  is  at stake, but  the  larger, more devastating threat lies in  the apparent intentions of Soviet au thorities to indict not only the individ uals on  trial, but  Jewish  tradition  itself. We are witnessing,  therefore,  the gradual deterioration and near ex tinction of an  institutional  form of  cultural and religious life.  This is the situation to which each  and every one of us must be attuned.  In so doing, we may choose either to  turn our heads in abeyance, or we may  voice  our disappointment  and near  contempt  for  the  inhumane  and  unjust activities to which we are all  observers. Today,  I  have chosen  to  follow the second route. I join my col leagues here on the floor of this great  institution not only  to  rebuke  the  Soviet Union for its denial of funda mental human rights, but also to pay  special  tribute  to  those  individuals  who have chosen to fight for  those  rights. Rejecting  the persistent  as saults on their dignity, refusing to re nounce  their  Jewish  identification,  and observing the religion,  language,  history, and culture for which their  predecessors  have  continuously  fought,  those individuals deserve our  full support and our highest praise. As  their counterparts in other countries  of the world struggle to maintain their  historic  identities,  so  too  do  the  Jewish citizens of  the Soviet Union  fight for the right to preserve what  little they have left.  I have recently witnessed the true  strength of the Jewish heritage, reli gious and cultural life, as a guest of  the Anti-Defamation League  on  a  firsthand basis. During my first and  recent trip  to Israel, I observed the  lifestyle of a people who have for far  too  long been  the victims of harsh  human rights abuses. A people who  have continued  to  rally against  the  pulverization of their institutional life  and the near obliteration of their very  consciousness, a people who refuse to  stop fighting until their existence is  assured. We visited with the highest  government  leaders,  the educational  leaders, and rubbed shoulders with the  regular people on the streets of Jeru salem. The Israel which I saw is an  Israel of democracy. This great demo cratic nation is one of which we may  be proud, a brotherhood in which we  should be proud to render our assist ance.  It does not surprise me that many  Soviet Jews hope to someday emigrate  to Israel, where they can freely prac tice their traditional lifestyles. Howev er, even if we surmise that what Soviet  Jewish communities want is  to rees tablish and renovate their oppressed  culture, then why should they not be  allowed that right? Why should they  not be allowed to exercise the right to  stay and live the way they want, to  exist as a cultural entity. If this is in  fact  favorable  to many Soviet Jews,  then  it  is up  to us  to  implore  the  Soviet Union for denying  this right,  and for continuing an unconscionable  ",1985
4,41,3,Mr.  YOUNG  of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker, Soviet  Jews  comprise  the  third largest surviving Jewish commu nity  in the world. Soviet Jews have  been  struggling  to  achieve  basic  human rights,  including the right to  maintain their own religion and cul ture. The right to leave any country  that denies one their heritage  is an  internationally  recognized  human  right, yet in the Soviet Union permis sion to emigrate is given arbitrarily.  I believe that it is important that in  the face of this wave of anti-Semitism,  America must  reaffirm our commit ment to human rights. The U.S. Con gress has been a leading supporter of  Soviet Jews in their attempts to study  and teach their faith.  We have held ""Congressional Prayer  Vigils"" on behalf of Soviet Jews, but  we must be sure that the vigil contin ues  each and  every day 1-mtil  the  human rights of all Soviet Jews have  been restored.  As a Member of Congress and con cerned citizen, I have adopted a Soviet  Jewish  family  from  the Ukraine  to  help them fulfill their dream of emi grating to Israel.  Samuel and Manya Klinger have  been  trying  unsuccessfully,  for  a  number of years, to emigrate to Israel.  Samuel Klinger is an agronomist from  Dnepropetrovsk  in  the Ukraine. He  and his wife, a nurse by profession,  have been repeatedly denied exit visas  since 1970. The only reason given by  Soviet authorities has been a  lack of  consent  from Manya's parents, who  have not seen their daughter in many  years. Manya, a mother herself,  re cently celebrated her 50th birthday.  The Klinger situation is quite press ing in that they are the only family in  Dnepropetrovsk  awaiting  exit visas.  Recently,  a  defamatory  letter was  printed in a local newspaper about the  family-prompting Samuel to immedi ately send a  letter of protest to the  editor. The result was the printing of  another  anti-Semitic  article  in  the  same paper.  We have asked the Soviet Govern ment to grant this family permission  to emigrate, but have received no re sponse. There can be no doubt that by  not allowing the Klingers to leave the  Soviet Union, the Soviet Government  is  in clear violation of the Helsinki  Final Act,  the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, as well as  their  Soviet Constitution.  Surely the emigration of the Klinger  family would pose no threat to the se curity of the Soviet Union, and instead  would be a humanitarian gesture. Yet  permission  to  leave  is  continually  denied.  As the leader in the free world, the  United States must do all that we can  to protect  the human  rights of all  people. And I urge my colleagues to  continue to protest the blatant viola",1985
5,54,3,Mr. GROTBERG.," I thank the gen tleman from Georgia for yielding to  me.  Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting my  opportunity to speak up on behalf of  our friend, Rick Mcintyre. But I have  also been waiting  to speak out  for  what I observe as one of the biggest  aberrations of  the domestic process  that I have seen in my 12 elections I  have been through. I am from Illinois,  Mr. Speaker, and we all know about  elections in Illinois.  We know that they can come and go,  chicanery  is not a new word in the  State of Illinois and its election proc ess. But when the winners win, they  are seated, and then we go about the  people's business.  One of my concerns is, and I was re minded yesterday morning going  to  the church services that many of us go  to Ash Wednesday, I was reminded of  the words of our Lord who said rather  explicitly: ""In that ye have done it  unto one of  the  least of  these, my  brethren, you have done it unto me.""  I  think all 433 Members of  this  House are at stake in this basic princi ple of  justice by democracy and by  democratic action in the ballot box.  Mr. Speaker, I think Marcellus said  it rather well  to Horatio,  the great  Dane in that big castle, when he said:  ""Me thinks there is something rotten  in the State of Denmark.""  Those are the kinds of words that I  heard last week, 10 days I was home in  the field working with my voters. And  you  know what? Way out  in  the  middle of Illinois; not in Indiana, they  are beginning  to  ask  questions  on  other things besides the budget and  the farm bill. They are beginning to  ask ""What's the matter with that Con gress?""  We  all get blamed, Mr. Speaker.  What  is  the matter with that Con gress, that 500,000 people in the south western part of Indiana are not on  board yet? We have been answering  our mail; the letters from there come  in by a hundred or two a day; they  have no one  to write  to. What has  happened to this system? Is it 30 years  of power that would corrupt? Is it that  absolute power corrupts absolutely?  I hope not, Mr. Speaker. The worthy  opposition consists of fine people rep resenting  their  legislative  districts,  much as you and I represent ours.  If the gentleman from Georgia CMr.  GINGRICH] would understand,  along  with the rest of the world, that just a  few months ago we sent our Army and  Navy in to liberate a country of less  than 500,000 people; Grenada.  Margaret Thatcher was here yester day. A few months before she sent the  British Navy down to take back the  Falkland Islands because of basic dis agreements  in  how  government  is  going to be run.  Good heavens, I do not want, Mr.  Speaker,  for  us  to  compare  those  chemistries with the chemistry that is  going on here. The solution for this  problem lies right in this House. It lies  right in the hands of the leadership of  this House. It lies in the hands of the  gentlemen on the election committee  that has been appointed, and those de cisions have to made.  The injury that has been done has  been done. Our comrade-in-arms still  waits to be seated. That is not fair; it  is unjust, un-American.  I was around when Truman was a  member of the Un-American Activities  Committee, one of the great Demo cratic leaders of our time. I wonder if  he is turning over in his grave now as  he looks about what is going on in his  old Congress of these United States.  Very  un-American  activities  can  happen right in this Chamber, and I  challenge the great leaders of the op position that enough is enough, and  that the people of America are begin ning to ask, Mr. Speaker: Why don't  we get on with the people's business?  There are States in this Union that  do not have 500,000 people in them,  that have 2 Senators and a Represent ative seated in this body. And yet we  deny a half a million people the basic  right to join with us in deciding the  important issues.  Can you imagine living in southwest ern Indiana and not have your Con gressman vote on the farm bill in time  for the spring seeding in March, if the  Senate gets it over here today? We will  be doing something.  It is just basically unfair. I deplore it  personally, but on behalf of the rest of  the people of America and my district  in particular, we object  to what  is  going on.  ",1985
6,54,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," I thank the gentle man for bringing these points out. As  you mentioned, you do have a distin guished  record of having  run  in a  number of  elections;  you do  know  what it is like to deal in a situation  with very close elections.  In clcsing, let me say that I  think  one of the most amazing distortions  and deliberate deceptions which some  people in some places have been talk ing about as it relates to this election  in Indiana is this question of the votes  that were not counted.  Let me  quote  again  Kuebler, who said:  from Helen  Legislators passed the laws for Indiana,  not to count the ballot if it is not initialed  or does not have the ward and precinct.  <This is to prevent ballot-box stuffing, or il legal voting.) We upheld these laws in the  recount.  In other words, many of the people  whose ballots were not counted may  never have voted;  it may not have  been people. It may have been local  ballot box stuffing.  ",1985

51,80,3,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President,  there  are some who may feel the credit crisis  facing America's farmers and ranchers  is  not  serious  enough  to  demand  action immediately. For those, I would  like to share with them a  few facts  which I believe will indicate the severi ty of the current situation.  An estimated 430,000  farmers are  currently facing serious credit prob lems. The administration's debt set aside program has simply not worked  and it will not work as long as the cur rent regulations remain intact. Unoffi cial estimates from the Farmers Home  Administration as of January 25, indi cated that 109,319 borrowers had ap plied for assistance under the debt set aside programs.  Now,  I want to repeat that figure  again, Mr. President. 109,319 have ap plied for assistance.  Of that number, 3,248 borrowers had  their applications approved and 9,150  had been rejected. Of course,  if you  calculate it, almost 100,000 have not  had any action taken one way or an other on  their applications at  this  point.  The program has been in place for  several months. These  are  farmers  who need assistance now. They do not  need assistance a year from now. They  do not need assistance 6 months from  now. Rather, they actually needed as",1985

53,93,3,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I want  to pay tribute today to the new mayor  of Clinton, TN. Mayor Cathy Brown is  Clinton's first woman mayor and also  the youngest ever elected to fill  the  post, but as those of us who know her  and work with her realize, she would  have gained distinction as a local offi cial even without being a ""first,"" or  ""youngest.""  Mayor Brown comes  from a  long time, well-known, and well-liked Clin ton family. She has proven herself to  be a success in several professional ca reers, and has done an excellent job at  building up and maintaining the real  estate business she took over from her  late father.  In an article recently published in  Tennessee Town and City, it is clear  that her dedication to both her com munity and to her business and civic  activities is sure to help her along the  way  toward fulfilling a goal she ex presses, and that is:  ""10 years from  now, I would like to hear it said that I  was not just the youngest and the first  woman mayor, but the best.""  I  join all of those who respect and  admire Mayor Brown in wishing her  the best of luck in the pursuit of her  goal.  PINCKNEY KEEL SCHOLARSHIP  FUND CREA TED  ",1985
54,93,3,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I wish  to call  to  the attention of my col leagues  the  establishment  of  the  Pinckney Keel Academic Scholarship  for journalism students at Middle Ten nessee State University  in Murfrees boro.  This scholarship will enable deserv ing  journalism  students  at Middle  Tennessee State University to pursue  a career in print journalism. In receiv ing this scholarship, I am confident  that these students will carry on the  tradition of Pinckney Keel who was  one of the foremost journalists of the  Nashville Banner.  Pinckney Keel worked in every facet  of the Nashville Banner's operation.  At one time or another, he was a re porter, music  critic,  assistant  city  editor, copy desk chief, editor of the  weekender section, managing editor,  and at the time of his passing, editor  of the Nashville Banner forum.  Tennessee  journalism  suffered  a  great loss with the passing of Pinck ney Keel, but it  is  fitting  that  the  journalistic ideals he held so dear will  be carried on by the many young Ten nesseans that will have the good for tune to be recipients of the Pinckney  Keel Academic Scholarship.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the recent announcement of  the Pinckney Keel Scholarship which  was carried in the February 1985 issue  of the Tennessee Press be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the an nouncement was ordered to be printed  in the RECORD, as follows:  ",1985

58,132,3,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I  join  my  colleagues  in  commending  the  leaders of agricultural task force, par ticularly Senators BOREN and ExoN,  for the very important work they have  been doing in trying to bring to the  floor of the Senate emergency farm  legislation that can help save farmers  that are now threatened with disaster  and bankruptcy. I think that the scale  of this problem across America is now  of a dimension that it is the most im portant matter in terms of urgency for  us to deal with of anything that I see.  I think, whether it is the Meese nomi nation or any other legislative  item  that might be contemplated, because  of the growing season,  the need for  farmers to get necessary credit so that  they can have the seed and the other  materials  they  need  to  begin  the  planting season, we have to act on the  farm issue within the next 7 days.  These other matters  are matters  that can wait-whether they have to  do with appointments to jobs by par ticular  individuals or whether  they  happen to be other items that have  been  suggested. The  farm  problem  cannot wait, will not wait. The calen dar does not wait. The time that it  takes to go through the process of get ting  the supplies and  the credit  in  place so that the farm sector of the  country and the economy can function  properly requires that we act now.  It is ironic, Mr. President, that there  are people in this Chamber who come  from farm States and farm areas of  the country and seem to be reluctant  to do that, or reluctant to face that  fact.  It would seem  to me  that we  ought to be hearing from all the farm  State Senators all the expressions of  urgency because the facts are there.  They are well known. In fact, they are  in the newspapers and on national tel evision every single day, the dimension  of the tragedy that is building up in  the farm sector of our economy.  That is the most important matter  for us to attend to right now because  there is an emergency and there is a  general sense of urgency and require ment that we act without any further  delay.  Mr. President,  there are a host of  legislative proposals and ideas that are  ready to go. As a matter of fact, the  House of Representatives is scheduled  to act on this matter on an emergency  basis on Wednesday of next week.  There is absolutely no reason why the  Senate, whether it is tomorrow, over  the weekend or on Monday or Tuesday  or Wednesday or Thursday of next  week, cannot itself act on an equally  timely basis. We can act, we should  act, and there is no reason for us not  to act. So any suggestion that these  matters can be put aside or that delay  is acceptable, I think, is just incorrect.  That is wrong thinking, and we ought  not to be misled by it.  We are facing problems that require  immediate and urgent attention, and  our responsibility, I think, as Senators  representing 50 States, is to respond to  that emergency now while  the  re sponse can do some good, while it can  actually  respond  to  the problem  in  time.  I must say that in watching televi sion programing the last several days,  I have seen televised reports of farm  auctions, where  family  farms  have  been put on  the auction block and  farmers of all ages, farm families rep resenting generations of people who  have been in farming, men and women  in their sixties and fifties and forties  and thirties, who have been farming  successfully, because of a variety of  circumstances are now  in the credit  crunch that has been described so well  by others who have spoken before me,  are forced into a situation where they  are losing everything they have.  At these farm auctions not only is  their farm and their land being sold  off, but also all their possessions are  being sold off-the farm equipment,  their home furnishings, literally every thing. If they are finally left even with  a vehicle with which to drive away,  that may be all they have, plus the  clothes on  their backs and possibly  one or two suitcases.  I think that is a pretty sorry state of  affairs for people to have to be facing  in large numbers, in a vital sector of  our economy, people who have worked  hard all  their lives, who have been  productive, who have produced for the  country, who have been paying taxes,  who are many of our best citizens, in  the sense of meeting all the require ments  that one might expect  from  people in this country, who work hard,  and who in every way live exemplary  lives. Many are  in  their fifties and  their sixties, standing out amidst their  goods as the goods are being offered  for 5, 10, or 15 cents on the dollar,  with tears running down their faces,  with older children, younger children,  and  grandchildren  standing  there,  with all  the  terrible feelings of de spondency that go with a situation of  that kind. This is not happening to a  handful of people and in a handful of  States. This is happening now to thou sands of  families,  about  to become  tens  of  thousands  of  families,  all  across this country. Yes, concentrated  more in some areas than others, but  literally happening all over this coun try. We can do better than that, and  we have an obligation  to do better  than that.  I know that all Senators have plans,  assuming that we are going to work a  normal workweek here and be gone on  the weekends to attend to family re sponsibilities or  trips  to our home  States,  to our constituents,  and  to  meet obligations we may have in other  places. But I think there comes a time  when there is a crisis brewing in a sig nificant part of our country in which a  response  is needed on an immediate  basis and we have an obligation to be  here and to be at work. If that means  staying here all night, fine. If it means  being here  tomorrow and over  the  weekend, fine. But let us be sure that  we are here, and I am prepared to be  here, that we stay long enough to get  this Job done, not some  transparent  device, some way of sloughing off the  problem, something that is designed to  look like it is an answer when it is not  an answer at all.  We have an obligation to stay here  and act on this problem. But, more  than that, we have an obligation to  come up with a solution that is going  to work, not Just window dressing, not  something that is Just designed to save  face or designed to remove this thing  as a matter of concern before  the  Senate.  No, it has to stay before the Senate  until it is dealt with sufficiently, and  that means that Mr. Meese has to wait  and other things have to wait, because  the problem we are talking about is of  such an urgency and dimension that it  cannot wait. It has to be dealt with  now, and we have an obligation to deal  with it, and it is my hope that we will.  If it means that some time has to be  spent in debate, we will spend time in  debate. But let us get some legislation  up on the floor here. There are plenty  of bills. Let us get them up on the  floor;  let us debate  it;  let us start  voting. Let us  find out how people  feel. We are not going to pass any thing that 51 Senators do not want.  Let us see if there are 51 votes here. I  think there are. I think there are 60  votes, maybe  even  65  votes,  for  a  meaningful emergency farm program.  So let us have the votes. Let us find  out. Let us bring up the issue. If the  votes are not here, at least the farmers  would have their day in court, in the  U.S. Senate. They would have had a  chance for their issues to be looked at  and debated and voted up or down. Let  us get everybody on the record. Let us  find out how people feel on this issue.  This Senator is ready to vote, and I  hope the other 99 Senators are ready  to vote as well. Let the Senate work its  will, and let the farmers of the coun try have an opportunity to have this  issue debated on a timely basis, so that  ",1985
59,158,3,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President,  I  am  today  introducing  legislation which  represents a continuation of  the ef forts  of  the  distinguished Senator  from Iowa-Mr. GRASSLEY-and myself  to eliminate a problem with the Gov ernment  procurement  process  com monly ref erred to as  the ""Revolving  Door."" I am also pleased to have Sena tors SIMON, GORE and HARKIN as origi nal cosponsors of my bill.  I want to commend my colleague in  the House of Representatives, Con gresswoman  BARBARA  BOXER,  who  today will introduce very similar legis lation in that body. I find it encourag ing and significant that Members on  both sides of  the Capitol and both  sides of the aisle are convinced of the  need for  legislation, and are in fact,  leading the way for reform.  The revolving door problem mani fests itself when Government procure ment personnel leave their jobs and go  to work shortly thereafter for the very  same contractor over whom they had  contract authority. The appearances  of conflict of interest and favoritism  have been many, and have been cited  by the p:ress, and by other Members of  Congress. Our intent with this bill is  to remove the potential for procure ment personnel  to show contractors  favor in order to secure employment  with that contractor in the future.  Our bill would require as a part of  all Government contracts a standard  clause which  all  contractors must  agree to when they do business with  an agency of  the U.S. Government.  This clause would prohibit a contractor from hiring a Federal employee or  member of the uniformed services who  had substantive procurement responsi bility relative to that contractor for a  period of 5 years from the termination  of that contract. If the contract period  should exceed the separation date of  the employee  in question,  then  the  prohibited period would be 5 years  from the date of that separation.  Each contractor must report to the  Government agency of the former em ployee that that employee has been  hired if that is the case within 5 years.  The Inspector General of the agency  and the Director of the Office of Gov ernment Ethics shall have access  to  these  reports.  The Director  shall  submit an annual report to Congress.  Our intent is not to simply discour age the practice of employees resign ing  to  accept questionable  employ ment. We want it stopped, as do tax payers. This is why our bill contains  stiff  damages  for  violations which  would be assessed against the contrac tor and determined by multiplying the  employee's annual  salary  times  the  number of days he or she worked in  violation of the law.  Mr. President, the Project on Mili tary Procurement released a series of  documents this week which indicates  that certain military personnel are  acutely aware of the problems which  occur when their coworkers go to work  for contractors over whom they have  previously had contract authority.  I  find the concerns of those inside the  system especially pertinent as we con sider the need for this type of bill.  Included in these documents was a  report prepared by an Office of Gov ernment Ethics  representative, Mr.  Jack Covaleski,  relative  to his visit  with Col. Jack Finder, Staff Judge Ad vocate, at the Air Force Contract Man agement Division CCMD]. The CMD is  responsible  for  administering  over  $100 billion of Air Fore~ contracts.  Most of this work is performed at 32  Air Force plant representative offices  CAFPROl  located on major defense  contractor plants.  The  following excerpt  documents is as follows:  these  from  Colonel Finder said that the major prob lem issues he finds are in the areas of post  employment, outside employment, and ac ceptance of gratuities.  Concerning  post  employment,  Colonel  Fisher said that 18 U.S.C. 207 and our regu lations do not deter the types of post em ployment problems typical of the Depart ment of Defense. There is a large turnover  of CMD personnel, especially of AFPRO of fices, who leave to work for contractors. For  example, the head of AFPRO office at Nor throp on Friday could become the Northrop  Vice President  for Quality Assurance on  Monday and immediately AFPRO employee  morale is destroyed. Employees openly dis cuss what the former employee has done  over the past few years for the contractor in  order to obtain the new  job, and wonder  why they themselves should be so ethical.  AFPRO employe""s must deal with  their  former  employee daily on many matters  <Government appearing before and seeking  data from the contractor> and feel betrayed  that the contractor now has all the inside  knowledge of how  the AFPRO operates.  Colonel Finder said these types of cases are  devastating to the ethics program because  of  the appearance of conflict of  interest  alone.  The Project on Military Procure ment also obtained a copy of a sugges tion Capt. Jeff Rohm made  in 1981  during his tenure as a staff judge ad vocate for the AFPRO at Pratt and  Whitney.  I  ask unanimous  consent  that the letter which Captain Rohm  sent  to  his Congressman  after he  made this suggestion be made a part  of the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  9020 SE HOBE RIDGE AVENUE,  Hobe Sound, FL, April 14, 1982.  Representative L.A. BAFALIS,  The Capitol Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN BAFALIS: Recently  I  submitted a suggestion to the Air Force call ing for a revision to an Air Force regulation  entitled ""Standard of Conduct for Govern ment Employees."" <See Atch 1.> Basically, I  proposed that key Air Force personnel in  sensitive positions of cognizance over a con tractor should be prohibited for a reasona ble  time after  their Government service  from employment with that contractor. The  Air Force regulation and the U.S. Code are  both ultimately directed  toward the same  goal-preserving the public's confidence in  the integrity of Government employees. As  an Air Force officer and attorney assigned  to a contractor's facility, <Pratt & Whitney  Aircraft> I have witnessed the reactions of  contractor employees and Government per sonnel when key  employees or officers,  often in sensitive, adversarial positions vis-a vis contractor, leave the Government and go  directly to work for that contractor. Regard less of any actual impropriety, the percep tion exists that perhaps such  individual's  past decisions were influenced by their pro spective employment.  I think this problem is common to all DoD  agencies, and not just the Air Force. In in formal conversations with reviewers of my  suggestion, they acknowledged the problem  but felt an Air Force regulation could not  solve it. <See Atch 2.) Accordingly, I appeal  to you for your support in plugging this se rious loophole by DoD directive, statute, or  perhaps some other way. The current law's  gap makes it worthy of attention.  I recognize, as noted in Atch 2, we should  defer  to  the ""careful  judgment of Con gress."" But I've seen nothing in the legisla tive history to indicate Congress intended to  ignore the problem. I also wonder whether  restricting employment of carefully selected  individuals in key positions for a reasonable  time vis-a-vis only a handful of contractors  raises ""serious questions about a person's  right to pursue a  livelihood and associate  with others."" In 18 USC 281, eg., while there  is a question about the artfulness of its lan guage, <See Field v. Brown 28 CCF 80,871  <D.C. D. Ct. 26 Nov 80)), there is no question  the Government may <and should) reason ably prohibit retired officers from selling to  their  former  services. Regardless of any  actual wrongdoing, the intent of such ethics  ",1985
60,171,3,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, a few  months ago Idaho lost one of its most  respected citizens, Tom Campbell. A  journalist by trade, Tom was the recipient of many awards,  including  the  Idaho Press Club's annual award for  feature writing in 1965. <He was the  first recipient.) Though he was a re spected reporter, Tom is most warmly  remembered for his weekly columns  and features, some of which comprise  his book, ""The Contemplative Stroll er.""  There have been Campbells in the  newsroom of  the Lewiston Morning  Tribune since 1910. Tom's father was a  long-time reporter with the Tribune;  his mother also wrote for the paper.  ""Young Tom"" carried a proud tradi tion.  Tom lived a life ""in defense of con templation and a slow pace."" He did so  despite a busy schedule. Not only did  he write, but he also received acclaim  as an actor. Tom was one of the found ers of the Lewiston Civic Theater, and  appeared in more than 30 plays. He  was awarded the Theater's Best Actor  Award in 1983 for his performance in  ""On Golden Pond."" Somehow, he also  found time to paint.  But he is best remembered as the  self-proclaimed ""contemplative stroll er"" along the Lewiston levee, amused  by grimacing joggers like myself. Tom,  on  the other hand, was one of the  strollers who watched ""the birds, the  sky,  the  sun,  the water and  each  other."" This was the world Tom knew  better than most of us. And he knew  how to show us that world with his  words. If he had given us that only, he  would have contributed much.  Mr. President, I ask that the follow ing articles  from  the Contemplative  Stroller be printed into the RECORD.  Contemplative strollers today might  run across Tom's tombstone.  I hope  Idahoans  run  across  his work  for  many, many years to come.  Tom's book,  ""The Contemplative  Stroller,"" serves as a lasting tribute to  his life. Look it up sometime in the Li brary of Congress, cataloged F 754 .L6  C35.  The article follows:  A GENERATION OF Two-WHEELERS  There are still those around town who tell  me they remember my father riding his bi cycle, his trouser leg wrapped tight by a clip  so it wouldn't get wound in the chain, his  head arched above a stiff detachable cellu loid collar that held his neck in a vice, a  conservative gray fedora pulled down to just  above his eyebrows and a sea of paper con taining tomorrow's news floating in and pro truding from his pockets.  I, too, retain the memory.  During his half century with the Tribune,  my father had five bicycles. The last one  was retired during World War II, officially  because he couldn't get spare parts, but ac tually because his old legs were giving out.  The first bike was stolen a few days after  he purchased it in 1904, the year he arrived  in town from Butte, Mont. The second bicy cle, which was of poor construction,  fell  apart when it hit bottom in a pothole with  aboard,  an  occurrence  that  is  not  known upon the streets of Lewiston to this  very day.  him  The third bicycle was a gift from the Trib une, a magnificent ""wheel"" as my father  called bicycles. It cost $60. He parked  it  against Frank Taylor's Cafe at 3rd and  Main one day and went inside for a spot of  lunch. What happened next was recounted  in an article he wrote a few years before he  died.  ""A friend came in asked me if that was my  wheel out front. I said it was and he said  'It's a wreck now.' I said that was impossible  because I always pulled my wheel up on the  sidewalk and away from the gutter.  ""But I went outside and, sure enough, my  wheel was a crumpled mess. A woman driv ing a car and making a turn onto 3rd and  Main at outlandish speed lost control. She  jumped the curb and went 500 feet down  the sidewalk. My wheel was the only obsta cle in her path.''  Bicycle No.  4 was  the bicycle  around  which legends have grown. It was the bicy cle that ended up in the Snake River, and  may be rusting on the bottom yet. All my  life I have heard different versions of how  No. 4 ended up in the Snake River, includ ing testimony from eyewitnesses.  My father set the record straight in one of  his articles.  ""When Lewiston was legally dry, the town  of Asotin was wet. There was a constant mi gration from here to the Oasis in Washing ton state. At one  time a motor car was  pressed into service to take orders for deliv ery back to Lewiston. This came to a halt  when  Idaho  law  enforcement  officers  stepped in. It therefore became necessary to  make  the  trip  to Asotin yourself  if you  wanted a drink.  ""A wheel is a cumbersome thing to carry,  especially when one is seated in a phaeton  pulled by two high-stepping horses and in  the company of agreeable companions. On  this trip, No. 4 was resting on the top of the  step and started to become a nuisance when  we were about half way across the bridge.  The only remedy was to toss the wheel over  the rail and make the rest of the trip un hampered. This was  done. Again  I was  afoot.""  Wheel No. 5, a Columbia which cost $20,  lasted until the end of the line.  It was either upon No. 4 or No. 5 that my  father courted my mother, a demure secre tary in the John P. Vollmer Grain Co. who  lived on the far reaches of 14th Avenue. She  sat there waiting for Mr. Right. It turned  out  to be my father, pedaling along  the  footpaths of Normal Hill, carrying bouquets  and candy in his wire basket.  My mother had another suitor of sorts.  He brought neither candy nor flowers and  he didn't have a bicycle. He just sat in the  parlor. He  could not compete with  the  wheel  rider  sailing  across Normal Hill,  swooping up to the front door, the gallant  elegantly bestowing gifts.  Sometimes, I have been told, she would  play  the piano and they would sing the  latest ragtime tunes. And other times, she  would get on the handlebars and they would  go riding across the empty spaces of Normal  Hill.  A few years ago, a woman who was a little  neighbor girl during the courtship days told  me she saw an unusual occurrence while  spying  upon  the  romantic  couple  from  behind a bush.  Instead of going to the front door, he rode  up to an open window and whistled. Miss  Lora, as this little girl called her, decorously  climbed through the window and onto the  handlebars. Laughing wildly,  they  rode  ",1985

69,197,3,Mr. HERTEL  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, 67 years ago, on February 16,  1918, the people of Lithuania rejoiced  in the democratization and independ ence of Lithuania. For a  regrettably  short period, Lithuanians enjoyed a  more liberal society-one in which cen sorship, religious persecution, and po litical oppression were replaced by the  freedoms of  speech,  religious  affili ation, and assembly. Czarist absolut ism and agrarian practices gave way to  human dignity and modernization as  political, social, and economic reforms  were instituted. For the first time in  centuries, Lithuanian culture was free  to flourish.  This democratic renaissance was cut  short by  the  illegal Soviet  invasion  and occupation in 1940 of Lithuania  and her sister countries, Latvia and  Estonia. To this day, opposition to the  forced annexation results in imprison ment,  deportations,  and  executions.  Yet,  those who seek  to make  their  homeland more humane, democratic,  and autonomous have not given up  hope. Such  torture  and  denial  of  human rights has kindled, rather than  abated the desire of Lithuanians for  self-determination.  The United States has never recog nized the Soviet incorporation of the  Baltic States. Today, and until Lithua nia is freed from the Soviet grip, we  must again denounce this breach of  international accords, as well as Soviet  violations of human rights. For those  who are imprisoned behind the Soviet  wall of domination and oppression, let  us in the free world reaffirm our soli darity with  their fight  for national  sovereignty.  For  those whose  an guished cries have been muffled by  censorship  and  persecution,  let  us  voice our convictions for the rights to  liberty and justice. We are all bound  by  the Soviet chains of oppression  when any of us continues to suffer at  the hands of the Soviets. Only when  we have alleviated all suffering will  humanitarian and democratic  ideals  become reality for all humanity.e  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS DAY  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 1985  e ",1985
70,197,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, with my  distinguished  colleague  from Michi gan,  [Mr. VANDER  JAGT] and with 77  other Members of this House, I intro duced today a House joint resolution,  3071  designating August 4, 1985, as Press  Freedom Day in the United States.  August 4, 1985, marks the 250th an niversary of the landmark decision in  the case of John Peter Zenger of colo nial New York. The publisher of a  weekly  journal, Zenger was charged  with  libel by  the Governor of New  York for articles exposing corruption  in the colonial government. In a stir ring courtroom defense of Zenger, at torney Andrew Hamilton argued for  the right of any newspaper to print  the truth for the common good of the  people.  The  decision  exonerating  Zenger served as a watershed event in  establishing the principle of freedom  of the press in this land.  The commitment  to public media  working  free of government censor ship was clearly evident in the draft ing of our Nation's Bill of Rights. The  influence  of  Thomas  Jefferson,  George Mason, and James Madison en couraged members of  the Constitu tional Convention to view press free dom as ""one of the great bulwarks of  liberty."" By embodying freedom of the  press in the first amendment to the  Constitution, our Nation demonstrat ed unprecedented trust in the ability  of a well-informed public  to be full  participants in their own Government.  Our Nation's support for freedom of  the  press  represents  faith  in  the  people. Through more than 200 years  of  journalistic history, our Nation's  courts  have  def ended  the  public's  ""right to know,"" and the impropriety  of Government censorship  in which  national security  issues were not at  stake. In the landmark case of New  York Times Co. versus United States,  Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black  stressed the inviolability of the first  amendment guarantees:  ""The Founding Fathers gave  the  free  press the protection it must have to fulfill  its essential  role  in our democracy. The  press was to serve the governed, not the gov ernors.""  And so  it has. And  through such  service our Nation is arguably the best  informed society in history.  There have been  times when  the  commitment to freedom of the press  was not easy to maintain. There have  been attempts to control the media,  limit its inquisitive nature, or discour age its publication efforts. But despite  the episodic setbacks, press freedom  remains as vital  today as when the  first amendment was ratified in 1791.  That vitality serves as an inspiration  for millions  of men  and women  throughout  the world whose under standing of events  is  limited by the  State controlled media in their home lands.  As a fundamental liberty designed to  ensure participation by an  informed  people in their government, it is im portant for this Nation not only to ex press  its appreciation of press  free",1985
71,223,3,Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, in response to the continuing  rise  in  the number of high school  3097  dropouts,  believed  to be  a  definite  factor in increased street crime, burg larly,  drug-related  crimes and drug  abuse,  in March  1977  a  group  of  Bartlesville, OK, community  leaders  decided to promote the establishment  of an alternative high school. Their ef forts  resulted  in  the  January 1977  opening of the Bartlesville Alternative  High School.  The purpose of the school is to reha bilitate  failure-oriented  secondary  school dropouts, potential dropouts,  truants, students on long-term suspen sion, those chronically involved in ju venile court action, pregnant minors,  and those having behavioral problems  severe enough to prohibit their par ticipation  in  the  established  high  school system. In order to fulfill  its  mission, the staff is carefully selected  both as to skill in teaching and skill  and experience in dealing constructive ly with the problems of these failure oriented  students. Each  student  is  given  a  demanding,  individualized  course of  instruction with emphasis  placed on basic education courses, for  example, math, English, science, and  social studies. Students are monitored  closely in small classes, many of which  must be geared to more than one level  of reading ability because of past fail ure records of students. The staff is  available continuously for counseling  and  outside  professional  counselors  are brought in for once-a-week group  counseling sessions. All counseling is  coordinated closely with the Bartles ville School Systems' Psychological  Services. Rigid discipline and attend ance standards are maintained at the  school. When needed, teacher-student  contracts, which exactly define teach er expectations and student responsi bilities with stated penalty for noncon formance, is used. A gratifying amount  of espirit de corp and motivation  is  achieved  in the resulting specialized  environment.  Bartlesville Alternative High School  has a remarkably high rate of success.  These  once  labeled  failure-oriented  students receive their high school di plomas,  pass  graduate  equivalency  exams and many are mainstreamed  into the regular schools. After gradua tion some seek higher education op portunities. Programs similar to this  one turn potential welfare or correc tions enrollees  into productive,  law abiding citizens and are worth an im mense amount to our society. Despite  their record, they suffer from funding  problems. Program cost are reasonable  at an average of $1,187 per student  when  compared  to  the  $15,000  to  $34,000 per year of an incarcerated ju venile. In Bartlesville, the community  has scraped to keep this much-needed  school through private donations and  special  allotments  from  the United  Fund. Despite  their efforts,  lack of  funding  still  remains,  and unfortu",1985
72,236,3,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  am deeply concerned over the Soviet  Union's dismal policy on emigration of  Jews and other minorities.  In 1984,  only 896 Jews were permitted to leave  the Soviet Union-a drastic decline  from  the 51,320 exit visas that were  granted Soviet Jews in 1979. Only 61  Jews were allowed to emigrate in Jan uary 1985. And Jews have been subject  to heightened persecution along with  other  religious minorities  in  recent  months.  With the United States-Soviet rela tionship especially volatile over  the  past two decades, it is clear that the  level of Jewish emigration has served  as hostage to the state of the bilateral  relationship.When detente was at its  height, the Soviets permitted Jewish  emigration to rise. But when our rela tions with the Kremlin are strained,  the  Soviets  drastically  reduce  the  number of exit visas.  As a signatory of the Helsinki Final  Act, the Soviet Union has pledged to  respect human rights,  including  the  right of citizens to emigrate freely and  to pursue family reunification. Yet the  Kremlin continues to hold Soviet Jews  hostage in a game of international pol itics and continues to harass Jews who  desire to emigrate. In recent months,  the Soviet Government has stepped up  its crackdown on Hebrew teachers and  other  Jewish  cultural  activists.  Hebrew  teachers are being arrested,  sentenced,  and  imprisoned  on  trumped-up  charges  designed  to  punish them for teaching and practic ing  their  religion.  All  Americans  should condemn  this shameful cam paign.  The Kremlin has little to gain by  continuing  to  block  the  legitimate  right of  the  Jewish  community  to  practice its faith and to emigrate. In  fact, Moscow has much to gain by al lowing its Jewish citizens and others  to emigrate. An increase in the grant ing of exit visas for Soviet Jews and  others would help to lessen tensions  between our two nations. I urge the  Soviet Union  to approve emigration  applications expeditiously and to make  a symbolic gesture by releasing Anato ly Shcharansky and allowing him to  emigrate, and granting Ida Nude! her  wish to be reunited with her sister in  Israel. Such positive gestures of good  will would be most welcome and most  constructive.  As an honorary Cochairman of the  newly established Congressional Coali tion for Soviet Jews, I will continue to  work hard with my colleagues to do all  I can to alleviate the plight of Soviet  Jews and other minorities seeking to  emigrate. I will also do my utmost in  pressing the Soviet leaders to liberal ize their emigration policy, to respect  the right of all their citizens to prac tice their religion free from pers~cu­ tion, and  to  live up  to  the human  rights guarantees of the Helsinki ac cords.  Mr. President, I am submitting for  the RECORD a table showing the disap pointing numbers of Soviet Jews being  granted exit visas by the Soviet Gov ernment.  There being no objection, the table  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [Soviet Jewry Research Bureau]  Jewish emigration from the U.S.S.R.

THE  CIVIL  RIGHTS  RESTORA TION ACT: A CLARIFICATION  ",1985
73,236,3,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, a  few days ago, on February 19, 1985,  Senator  HATCH  spoke  before  the  Senate on the subject of civil rights.  My colleague from Utah said the fol lowing:  Last week a number of Congressmen in troduced something  they are calling  the  Civil Rights Recovery Act of 1985, which is  essentially, a  rehash of last year's Grove  City bill. Some people called last year's bill  the Big Brother Act of 1984.  I  expect  that Senator Packwood  and  others will this week introduce a counter part to the House bill.  I was surprised and a bit confused by  the statement by  the Senator from  Utah. I have acted on this issue more  than 2 weeks ago when, on February 7,  I  joined Senators KENNEDY, WEICKER,  and 43 others as a cosponsor of S. 431,  the Civil Rights Restoration Act of  1985. This bill is not a rehash of last  year's bill but a very thoughtful piece  of legislation that takes into account  the hours and hours of debate that oc",1985
74,249,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, if  the Senator will yield-",1985
75,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON., I yield for a ques tion.  ,1985
76,249,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," I am not in a  position to acutally address the issue  which he has raised, but I have an other question I would like to ask. I  have two question. My first question  is, Do I recall that the distinguished  Republican assistant leader mentioned  that he was holding the floor until the  conclusion of a meeting between the  majority  leader  and  the minority  leader?  ",1985
77,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON.," That is one of the  purposes, Mr.  President,  for  that  effort; yes.  ",1985
78,249,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," My other ques tion is this: Has it come to the atten tion of  the Senator from Wyoming  that  the minority  leader  is on  the  floor? I assume, therefore, that we are  ready to go  to a vote. On behalf of  many who are interested in doing so, I  suggest that is the appropriate course  at this time.  ",1985
79,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON.," That is not the ap propriate course at  this  time,  I  re spectfully submit, until the majority  leader has addressed his assistant ma jority leader and then we will find out  what the appropriate course is.  ",1985
80,249,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  stand corrected.  ",1985
81,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON.," So on with the busi ness at hand.  There  is more  Meese.  Last March, during Mr. Meese's con firmation hearings before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I  felt that the  various serious allegations that were  raised  about  the  appointments  of  friends  and  acquaintances  of Mr.  Meese to Federal positions warranted  a very complete and full investigation.  So did Mr. Meese, I might add. He was  very clear on that. In fact, both he  and the President urged the appoint ment  of  an  independent  counsel,  which I have reviewed with you previ ously, Mr. President, in order that we  might get to the root of the charges,  and when all the facets were presented  and the facts, make some kind of a ra tional decision on his nomination.  So  the  facts were  placed  in our  hands. Jacob Stein, as I have indicated  to you,  is a very able and respected  counsel, with  the assistance of  five  deputy counsels, the FBI, and the full  resources of the Federal prosecutor's  office, he performed a very vigorous  about Ed  to  say  and exhaustive 6-month investigation  into every single detail of the allega tions concerning Mr. Meese.  Over 100 witnesses were interviewed  and a grand jury convened to question  45 witnesses at length and under oath.  Such massive amounts of information  were examined in this process that the  documents alone would fill a small li brary.  The intensive and detailed examina tion fully addressed, I think, all of the  merits of  the allegations and found  them  to be  really  just  that, allega tions.  There were  those who  seemed  to  want to cry out that there was a great  deal of ""smoke"" there, but this inten sive and microscopically fine detailed  inquiry revealed that there was not  any ""fire.""  So, as I said before, it was a real dis appointment  for me  to go  through  that procedure and then simply to dis regard the entire report of Mr. Stein.  That was puzzling to me, a disappoint ment. Actually, more  than a disap pointment. I  think it is a precedent  that we do not want to see occur again  if we are going  to really stick with  what we tried to do with regard to the  independent  counsel  issue  because  then what we do is to allow the stand ards  to become  too elusive and  too  subjective for even the best among us  to attain. We seem to have a curious  trait  in  this  place, maybe  in  the  United States. We seem  to demand  perfection  of  our  leaders  and we  demand perfection of our Government  employees and our fine President and  Vice President. The reason we demand  perfection of them is because we do  not have that in our lives.  It is much easier,  then,  to require  perfection of somebody else, and espe cially and in a more pronounced way  when you do not have it in your own  life.  I have seen that. That is a very fasci nating thing that I have seen in living.  We demand perfection  from others  when we ourselves are so very far from  it. That is reality in every sense. Those  who are most out of control are seek ing to see that others are in control,  which is another fascinating tidbit. I  could perhaps give some psychological  treatise on that at some future time.  But that is an interesting thing. The  more you are out of control in your  own life, you hope you can dump it on  somebody else and they will get in con trol. It is a fascinating game. That is  the kind of arena we get to play in  here.  It does not make it any easier when  we have colleagues who just choose to  juice up the troops. That makes it a  little tougher. It makes it a lot tough er, actually.  Then  thoughtful Republicans and  Democrats have  to come along and  police up after them, sort of like fol lowing the Fourth of July parade at  the Cody Stampede. That is what hap pens in this place. Guys who do not do  their homework, who love to juice the  troops up, then leave a lot of work for  the thoughtful Democrats and Repub licans alike who do  their homework  and like to get the Nation's business  done, many of them within the range  of my eye at this time.  I may not even vote alike with my  colleagues.  I  see  the Senator  from  Michigan shuffling this way, as he is  wont to do. He, Mr. President, would  be one that I would refer to. Perhaps  our voting records might be similar 15  percent of the time. He is one of the  persons I  referred to as a man who  does his homework and gets involved  in the issues of the day and all with out spending an inordinate amount of  time on hollow partisanship, fun and  games, or who can shoot who and lay  the trap line, that is why it is so pleas ant to work with him. I enjoy working  with him. He  is delightful  to work  with.  ",1985
82,249,3,Mr. LEVIN., Will the Senator yield  for a question?  ,1985
83,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON., I yield for a ques tion.  ,1985
84,249,3,Mr. LEVIN., I thank the Senator for  that compliment.  My question was whether he was  fully able to hear that thank you.  ,1985
85,249,3,Mr. SIMPSON.," I did. I appreciate it.  If it was in the form of an inquiry or a  question, it was delightfully received.  Well, back to other things.  We were  talking about perfection,  how interesting it is that we seek per fection from others when we do not  have it in our own lives. That could be  the subject of another white paper, I  think, especially for those of us in pol itics. The real issue, you see, is more  basic and the people of America can  understand it a lot better than we can.  That is when they think that the 100  of us should have some degree of per fection, we must always remind them  that will never occur because there is  the same percentage of lightweights,  screwballs and boobs  in  the United  States Senate as  in my  local home  town or your or your State because,  after all, it is a representative Govern ment. [Laughter.]  There is no way to escape that. We  would  like  to  escape  that, but we  cannot. It is a representative Govern ment. So you have the same percent age of those same people who elect  you in your own home community or  in your life or wherever you are. That  is the way it is. That comes with the  territory.  That basic fact, if we could perhaps  get that emblazoned on the front steps  of the Capitol, they would not expect  so much of us and we would not  expect so much of them. But, surely,  they would expect more of us than  they have been getting in the last 10  days as we have a very serious problem  ",1985
86,288,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, at the  request of Secretary of Agriculture  John R. Block I am introducing the  administration's farm bill.  As I have indicated on numerous oc casions, I am convinced that this is a  watershed year for agriculture. All of  us are aware of the problems of Ameri ca's farmers and ranchers. And all of  us want to remedy the serious prob lems in the farm economy. The ques tion is: How to do it?  We cannot and will not ignore these  short-term problems, but neither can  we  ignore the fundamental problems  that simply must be corrected if we  are ever to put U.S. agriculture on the  path of prosperity.  Mr. President,  the point  is  this:  Many of today's problems in the agri cultural economy are the result of the  present farm programs. I believe it is  clear to most citizens that our present  farm programs are just not working.  This  is  revealed  by  the  fact  that  during  the past 4  years net  farm  income declined 27 percent compared  to the previous 4 years while direct  Federal payments to farmers increased  by more than 300 percent.  That is why we must face up to re ality. That is why we must use the op portunity  afforded by  the  expiring  farm legislation to reform general ag ricultural policy to make it market ori ented,  flexible,  internally consistent,  long-term in design, and sensitive to  all elements of the production system.  The general thrust of the adminis tration's bill is to move in that direc tion. Because of that, the administra tion bill will receive the careful consid eration of all who are interested in the  long-term health of our agricultural  economy.  While saying  that,  I also want  to  point out that I will shortly be intro ducing my own farm bill which differs  in some respects from the administra tion's bill. The Committee on Agricul ture, Nutrition, and Forestry will be  holding hearings on  these proposals  and other farm bills in March.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the administra tion's bill be printed in the RECORD at  the conclusion of my remarks along  with, a summary of the bill, a section by-section analysis, a title-by-title cost  estimate, questions and answers, and  issue papers prepared by the adminis tration to accompany its Agricultural  Adjustment Act of 1985.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.501  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That it is  hereby declared to be the policy of the Con gress, recognizing the fundamental  impor tance of agriculture to the United States  and the world and the unparalleled produc tive capacity of the American agricultural  industry, to assure a continuous, adequate,  and wholesome supply of food and fiber and  the long-term stability for American agricul ture. This Act may be cited as the ""Agricul tural Adjustment Act of 1985"".  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TITLE I-AGRICULTURAL TRADE AND  EXPORT EXPANSION  Sec. 101. Statements of policy.  Sec. 102.

87,327,3,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President.  I  am  happy  to  introduce  legislation  today which would designate the week  of May 1, 1985 through May 7, 1985 as  ""National  Osteoporosis  Awareness  Week"".  My goal in introducing this joint res olution is to promote and support the  education of the American population  on the preventive measures available  to fight this debilitating disease.  Osteoporosis is a condition in which  bone mass decreases causing bones to  be more susceptible  to fracture. Be tween 2 and 5 million Americans seek  medical help each year for some prob lem linked to osteoporosis. It afflicts  approximately 15 million Americans  overall, beginning as early as age 35,  and  is particularly a  threat to thin boned,  light-skinned women, women  who undergo an early menopause and  women whose female relatives have os teoporosis. In fact, 88 percent of osteo porosis victims are women. But this is  not to say that it is a disease that af flicts only women. As the aging proc ess progresses the risk of developing  osteoporosis  increases and,  for  that  reason, our older Americans, male and  female, must become aware of this dis ease.  Every year about 1.3 million persons  45 years and older suffer from frac tures  attributable  to  osteoporosis.  Fractures of the spine, hip and wrist  are most  common.  The  dowager's  hump is the result of a spine fracture.  It is estimated that 150,000 hip frac tures occur each year as a consequence  of osteoporosis and about 12 percent  of these people will die of related com plications.  I  know  from visits with  older Iowans that these fractures are  debilitating and, for many,  incapaci tating, resulting in a loss of independ ence and freedom.  When  I  look at  statistics  stating  that: 19.6 percent of our population  consists of women over 40; 11.6 per cent of our population is 65 years and  older; 13.1 percent of our population  will be over 65 by the year 2000.  That figure will increase to 21.7 per cent by 2050, and a  statistic that I  have a personal interest in: 13.3 per",1985
88,340,3,Mr.  SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  February 24 will mark the 67th anni versary of the Estonian Declaration of  Independence, and  it  is  therefore a  most appropriate time to pay tribute  to the courage and spirit of the Esto nian people. The declaration is both a  reminder of the rich heritage of the  Estonian people and an expression of  their abiding faith in the future. For  while their personal and national in tegrity is cruelly oppressed it has not  been extinguished.  Although nations  and  empires of  Europe have fought over the Estonian  soil  through  the  centuries,  foreign  domination has never destroyed  the  identity, pride or dignity of the people  of Estonia. When the Estonian Repub lic was established after World War I,  its citizens  expressed  their commit ment to a free and democratic society  in a remarkable constitution, a docu ment modeled after the French, Swiss,  and United States Constitutions, and a  beacon of human rights and democrat ic government. During the brief period  between World War I and II, Esto nians prospered; they attained excep tionally high educational  standards,  and growth in the major spheres of ag riculture and industry became a model  for  other  democratic  nations. The  100,000  Estonian-Americans  with  whom we join in their day of celebra tion contribute greatly to the econom ic,  cultural,  political,  and  academic  growth  of  their  adopted American  communities. To every activity,  they  bring a deep respect for the traditions  of freedom and democracy, traditions  they had brought  from  their own  country.  Estonian Independence Day symbol izes  the determination and spirit of  the Estonian people. It provides an op portunity  for Americans  to  reflect  upon  the  proud  heritage  of  their  fellow citizens of Estonian descent and  their dedication  to the principles of  freedom and liberty for which this day  stands. This day is also an occasion to  remember courageous Estonians  like  Mart Niklus, who continue, against all  odds, to speak out in support of the  basic human rights defined in the Hel sinki Final Act.  Not more than 6 months ago, Mart  Niklus celebrated his 50th birthday as  a prisoner of conscience in the notori ous Soviet Chistopol prison, where An atoly Shcharansky is also incarcerat ed. Apart from a period during 196675, Mart Niklus has spent virtually all  of his adult life  in prison. A coura geous spokesman for his Estonian her itage, he has been condemned repeat edly  for  anti-Soviet  activities. Even  while  imprisoned, he has  remained  outspoken  in  his  protests  against  Soviet violations of human and nation al rights.  Brave Estonians, like Mart Niklus, in  the face of KGB interrogations, inter nal  exile  and  long  terms  in  labor  prison camps, continue to petition for  a nuclear freeze zone in Estonia. Let  us take this, the occasion of the 67th  anniversary of the Estonian Declara tion of Independence, and remember  these courageous men and women, and  hope, as they hope, that the day is not  far off when they may once again live  as a free and independent society   WEEKLY COLUMNS OF SENATOR  SIMON  e ",1985
89,340,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  each  week I write a column for the news  media of Illinois. When I say I write  the column,  that  is  literally  true-I  write it myself. It is not a staff pro duced column. I'm taking the liberty  of inserting  in  the RECORD  the first  few columns I've written this year. I  will enter them in the RECORD each  week so that my colleagues and their  staffs will know my thinking on a vari ety of  issues and so  they can help  refine my thinking. I need that.  The material follows:  DEBT-FREE ANNIVERSARY REMINDS Us THAT  DIFFICULT GOALS ARE ATTAINABLE  An anniversary slipped by the other day  which  should have  been more  formally  noted: On January 8, 1835 the United States  government made the final payment on the  national debt. The nation was debt-free.  Andrew Jackson was President. Secretary  of the Navy, Mahlon Dickerson, predicted  inaccurately that the date would go down in  American history as a holiday second only  to July 4th.  Senator Thomas Hart Benton in flowery  language said this was a phenomenon ""so  long unseen on earth, a great nation with out a national debt . . . to the astonished  vision of a wondering world.""  The newspapers reported there was ""great  cheering.""  How distant  that January day of 1835  seems-and not simply because of the pas sage of time.  With a national debt which now stands at  $1.6 trillion, we are not likely to see the re tirement of the U.S. debt in my lifetime, nor  in  the  lifetime of anyone  reading  these  words.  Now we are struggling to avoid increasing  it too much in the next fiscal year, a pale  goal  compared  to  the  goal  reached  in  Andrew Jackson's day.  While the latter goal is less dramatic, it  should be the solid resolve of Democrats  and Republicans in the House and Senate  and in the administration to stop this head long rush into fiscal chaos.  Contrary  to what some political  leaders  may suggest to you, stopping this showball ing debt is not going to be easy.  But the question is not whether it can be  done; obviously it can. The real question is  one of will, one of courage.  Will  the Democrats and Republicans  in  Congress have enough  courage  to move  within the next four years to a balanced  budget? Will the administration, no longer  faced with reelection problems, face the real  problem?  We are now  living on a gigantic credit  card, spending more than we take in, and we  are  telling  those  from whom we borrow:  send the bill to our children and our grand children.  This fiscal year the national debt will be  approximately $210 billion.  In fiscal year  1962, when John F. Kennedy was president,  many people were concerned about a total  federal budget  that that year crept past  $100 billion. Now the federal budget is over  $900 billion and the interest alone on the  debt this past fiscal year was $132 billion.  January 8, 1835.  That date should remind us that difficult  things are attainable.  We should honor those who achieved that  goal of eliminating  the national debt by  acheiving  a more modest  goal; moving  toward balancing the budget.  And  then I hope we can seriously  talk  about gradually reducing the federal indebt edness.  ",1985
90,366,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, for the  past 8  years, Harlon B. Carter has  served the National Rifle Association  as executive vice president. It has been  said that he possesses extraordinary  powers, but he has said modestly, and  truthfully, that the powers rest with  the 3 million NRA members nation wide who are dedicated to preserving  and defending the second amendment  of  the Constitution,  especially  the  right to keep and bear arms.  Recently  Harlon  Carter  stepped  down as executive vice president of  the NRA. He will continue to serve the  NRA in an advisory capacity and will  serve on  the association's executive  council. He will now have the opportu nity to spend time with his family, go  hunting,  fishing,  and participate  in  the numerous shooting sports he so  loves.  Mr. President, Harlon performed the  duties of his office with dignity,  in  keeping with  his  proud  character.  Those of us who know this remarkable  man join in extending our best wishes  to Harlon Carter on his retirement.  The NRA board of directors knew  they had a job on their hands finding  a new chief executive officer of compa rable stature. At the January meeting  of the NRA board of directors they did  just that by unanimously electing G.  Ray Arnett.  Mr. President, Ray Arnett is another  citizen of great character and wonder ful temperament who enjoys a well-deserved reputation for integrity, hones ty,  and  loyalty. He  has many  at tributes of a successful chief executive  officer:  a  fine  presence,  quick wit,  honed intelligence, and an enormously  persuasive manner. He has been  a  champion of both popular and unpop ular causes; but most importantly he  has never let prevailing opinion divert  him from the course he thinks is right.  In his new position, Ray Arnett will be  supporting  the  constitutional  free doms of American citizens to own fire arms for sport, personal protection, or  recreational purposes. Ray Arnett will  also fight to support professional fish  and game managers against antihunt ing extremists.  In a nutshell, Ray Arnett is a man  Harlon Carter will be proud to have  follow  in his footsteps-and the Na tional Rifle Association's 3 million  members and the Nation will be the  beneficiaries.  Ray Arnett is a nationally and inter nationally acclaimed hunting and con servation  authority. He  began  his  career as a geologist  in Bakersfield,  CA: He later served for 7 years as the  State's fish and game director under  then Gov. Ronald Reagan. Most re cently was the Assistant Secretary of  Interior for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.  He was  appointed  to  that position  early in 1981 by President Reagan and  served until his recent resignation.  Mr. Arnett  has made  a  lifetime  career of serving the interests of this  Nation by being actively  involved  in  wildlife management  and  shooting  sports.  Mr. Arnett was a director of the Na tional Wildlife Federation for 17 years.  He served two  terms as president of  the  National  Wildlife  Federation  before retiring in 1978. He is one of  the founders, and later board chair man, of the Wildlife Legislative Fund  of America and of its companion orga nization,  the Wildlife Conservation  Fund of America. He also has held  posts with the Wilderness Leadership  School, Game Conservation Interna tional, World Wilderness Congress,  Californians  for  Recreation,  and  Ducks Unlimited.  Mr. Arnett was recently appointed  to the Fish and Wildlife Foundation  by President Reagan.  Born in Quantico, VA, and a Marine  Corps veteran, Mr. Arnett saw combat  during World War II in  the Pacific  Theater, during which he received a  field commission. He served an addi tional 2 years during the Korean con flict.  I realize that many of my colleagues  have had the opportunity to exchange  barbs and words of wisdom with Ray  Arnett on matters of concern to hun ters, firearm owners, sportsmen, wild life enthusiasts, and conservationists.  And he has always been direct and  forthright.  ",1985
91,379,3,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to call attention to an in-depth  policy  report  released  last week by  three members of the Arms Control  and Foreign Policy Caucus. It is useful  to insert in the RECORD this bipartisan  report by Senator MARK  HATFIELD,  Representative GEORGE MILLER  from  California,  and Representative  JIM  LEAcH from Iowa,  the present chair man of the caucus.  The report, entitled ""U.S. Aid to El  Salvador: An Evaluation of the Past, a  Proposal for the Future,"" should stim ulate and contribute  to  the congres sional and public debate about U.S.  policy toward El Salvador. It includes  some disturbing findings about possi ble  lack of candor of  the executive  branch in its dealings with the Con gress, and, by proposing a new method  of analysis of our aid, challenges the  administration's claim that economic  aid to Salvador exceeds military aid by  a 3 to 1 ratio. The report also alleges  the existence of an intensified air war  in El Salvador, made possible by the  provision  of  equipment  from  the  United States, and warns against in creased civilian casualties as a result.  Finally, it includes major policy rec ommendations.  The report is lengthy, and will no  doubt be controversial. But it presents  a  provocative analysis and proposes  new approaches.  the report itself states, it ""was  prepared  jointly by its sponsors and  their staff, and by  the staff of  the  Arms  Control  and  Foreign  Policy  Caucus. It does not seek to reflect the  views of the members of the caucus.""  I ask that the report be printed in  the RECORD.  The report follows:  As  U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR: AN EVALUATION OF  THE PAST, A PROPOSAL FOR THE FuTURE  SUMMARY  The United States has provided $1.7 bil lion to the Government. Central Bank and  Armed Forces of El Salvador since the out break of civil war in 1980. Over these five  years, U.S.  funding  for El Salvador has  grown dramatically-increasing nearly ten fold between fiscal years 1980 and 1984. It  now stands at over half a billion dollars a  year, and the Administration is expected to  request similar or  larger amounts  in  the  future.  The purpose of this report is to provide  Congress with an analysis of the lessons of  past funding for El Salvador, so that legis lators can make informed decisions on up coming requests. We have obtained informa tion on the projects. activities and equip ment provided by U.S. aid that is far more  detailed than that which is generally avail able to the Congress, and have analyzed the  data to ascertain the content, strategy and  impact of the aid. We believe  that many  Members of Congress, if not most of us, will  be surprised to learn of the actual use of  that aid, and of the strategy it reflects.  Footnotes at end.  The report is divided into five sections:  The first section explains the need for the  report, by documenting the lack of respon siveness  and  candor  of  the  Executive  Branch in providing Congress with accurate  information on our Salvadoran aid. This  section gives specific examples of instances  where  insufficient, misleading,  and  even  false information has been provided to Con gress.  The second section challenges the Admin istration claim that ""economic"" aid is three  times as great as ""military"" aid. By develop ing more precise and more realistic catego ries of aid, based on  its use rather than  what U.S. agency administers it, we find in stead that direct war-related aid is double  the amount of our aid for reform and devel opment; and that the largest single category  of aid is indirect war-related economic main tenance, which merely neutralizes the ef fects of the civil war.  The  third  section analyzes  the ""direct  war-related aid,"" and describes the overall  U.S. strategy reflected by that aid-a strate gy which seeks a military victory over the  rebels, and a strategy which has escalated  from a relatively straightforward attempt to  expand and upgrade the Salvadoran Army  into  a  sophisticated  and  technological  counter-insurgency strategy, reminiscent of  Vietnam. of aerial bombardment and air  mobile assault. This strategy is found likely  to  require  increased U.S.  involvement  in  terms of both funds and personnel.  The fourth section evaluates  the  three  categories of U.S. aid which are not ""direct ly war-related:"" Indirect War-Related Aid,  Aid for Reform and Development, and Com mercial Food Aid. This section concludes  that efforts for true reform have been sty mied by the right wing, by the civil war  itself, and by relatively low U.S. funding pri orities. It also  finds  that the strategy of  maintenance, while successful in the short  run in propping up a government, is likely  to require  increased U.S.  resources in the  long  run. And  finally,  it  finds  that  this  strategy of maintenance actually serves as a  disincentive  to negotiations for a political  settlement.  The last section suggests ways that Con gress, through changing the composition of  the U.S. aid package, can reduce the level of  violence in El Salvador and shift U.S. policy  from a policy which seeks an unattainable  military  solution  to one which provides  maximum support for a cease-fire, followed  by  intense negotiations  for a  settlement.  Recommendations include proposals to stop  funding t!le air war;  to redirect the Cash  Transfer funds to Reform and Development  programs;  to enforce  the original 55-man  cap on U.S. military personnel in El Salva dor; and to require that U.S. military action  can be undertaken only with the prior con sent of Congress.  SECTION  I: THE NEED FOR THIS REPORT: THE  CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTl''E RELATIONSHIP ON  AID TO EL SALVADOR  This report is  intended to provide Con gress with an analysis that will focus debate  over U.S. aid to El Salvador on the purposes  and effects of that aid, rather than simply  on the amount of aid to be provided, or on  the conditions that the Government of El  Salvador must meet to obtain it. In brief,  this report should help Members of Con gress become familiar with the content and  strategy of U.S. funding for El Salvador the ""what"" and ""what for,"" in addition to  the amount or the ""how much.""  An analysis of the purposes and effects of  U.S. aid would usually be seen as the task of  the Executive Branch. Literally hundreds of  personnel  in  agencies participate  in  the  preparation of information for Congress on  the Salvadoran aid program. Unfortunately,  as this section will document, the Adminis tration has provided insufficient, misleading  and in some cases false information to Con gress. As a  result, Congressional-Executive  relations have become increasingly strained.  Following are examples of the insufficient,  misleading  and  false  information which  have  provoked  increasing  Congressional  skepticism  of Administration  representa tions.  Examples of insu.tficient in/ormation  Classified and unclassified Congressional  Presentation documents for FY84 Supple mental and FY85 aid to El Salvador, from  both AID and DOD, were unusually meager  in their descriptions of the content of pro posed funding. AID requested all $120 mil lion of FY84 Supplemental funds and $140  million of $290 million in FY85 funds under  the single line item ""New Activities"", rather  than providing the usual project titles and  descriptions for its requests. No break-down  of ""New Activities"" was made available to  Congress until after House and Senate floor  votes on both the authorization and appro priation.  DOD's request was even less informative  than AID's, being three as compared to 18  pages long,  in a  request for $311 million.  Neither  specific  types of equipment nor  total  quantities were  listed.  Formal  at tempts by Members of Congress to get more  details resulted in the transmittal of data  only on past, not proposed, aid. For both  AID and DOD programs, Members of Con gress knew how much funding was  to be  provided, but not what it was intended to  buy.  The Administration failed  to  inform all  relevant committees of plans to build an air base  in eastern El Salvador. The closest  they came to disclosing these plans was to  suggest that the existence of only one field  in the country hampered helicopter efforts  to cover the whole country.1 The Adminis tration acknowledge  that the airbase was  being built over a month after Congression al floor votes on the aid request, and, per haps coincidentally, only after Newsweek  had reported the construction plans.  The Administration hid from virtually all  Members of Congress,  including those on  specific Committees of  jurisdiction,  its in tention to supply El Salvador with four AC47 gunships. Although  the AC-47s  repre sented a major increase in the level of vio lence in the civil war <since they can deliver  18,000 rounds per minute and blanket the  size of a football field>. they were not listed  in the Administration's aid requests or in cluded in briefings prior to floor votes  in  both houses. 2  Following press reports of U.S. intentions  to supply the four gunships, Members of  Congress protested that the issue had never  been discussed during review of the aid re quests. As  a  result,  an  agreement was  reached to send only one AC-47, and that  one a downgraded one which would be used  on a  trial basis under rules precluding its  use in populated areas. 3 Without informa tion from the media, the original four gun ships would have been delivered.  Examples of misleading in/ormation  In  response  to Congressional  inquiries  about corruption in the U.S. Cash Transfer  program  in El Salvador, AID  repeatedly  denied  that corruption was  a  significant  problem, and stated that ""management ac",1985

[Laughter.]  I was visiting with the Senator from  Colorado and was distracted from the  conversation, but I heard the glowing  remarks, did not miss those, and was  reflecting that the Senator from Colo rado looked rested and healthy. He is  a delightful gentleman. I have served  with him on the Nuclear Regulation  Subcommittee. He was chairman when  I started. I was ranking member, and  those roles are now reversed.

In any event, I do admire what the  Senator from Illinois has brought to  the body in the way of the issue-cer tainly, what the Senator from Oklaho ma [Mr. BOREN] has brought to the  issue.  I do not think any of us dreamed,  when Senator BOREN  and Senator  ExoN decided  to proceed with  their  comments about the farm issue, that  we would have reached this point.  I was a legislator in a State legisla ture. I was a majority leader. I have  been a minority member. I think it is  always good  to  remember how  it  is  when you are on both sides.  I  remember very distinctly how  it  was when I was in the minority in this  body. I am not here to be petulant or  petty, but at some future time I will  relate  those experiences of being  in  the minority while our very capable  majority  leader  then, Senator BYRD,  was  trying  to get his  agenda per formed.  It meant a great deal to him that he  did get his agenda performed and to  do that he expressed an extraordinary  array of procedures to get that agenda  performed. That is why I have high  regard for him.  Now,  we  have  another majority  leader who has an agenda to perform.  There is no escaping what the agenda  is. The agenda is the Ed Meese nomi nation,  the  interstate cost estimate  issue, and famine  relief  in Ethiopia.  We think those are important.  We thought the farm issue was so  important that we expressed  to  the  President, and he was ahead of us and  so was the Secretary of Agriculture,  that  they do  something. Something  was done to the tune of over $680 mil lion with millions more in the pipeline  ",1985

131,405,3,Mr. FORD., What  order?  ,1985
132,405,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  regular order is that the Senator from  Rhode Island has the floor, and he  has refused to yield for any purpose.  ",1985
133,405,3,Mr. CHAFEE.," Things are getting  testy around here. [Laughter.]  Let us proceed, Mr. President. I have  the floor. I have listened to the distin guished Senator from Maryland, who  spoke at considerable length. Others  here have spoken. No one can ever  accuse the Senator from Kentucky of  being bashful in seeking the floor.  Mr. President, here is the situation:  The matter before the Senate is the  nomination of Mr. Meese. After that,  we can move right to a series of mat ters. Talk of the crisis on the farm, let  us get to this. I believe the nomination  of Mr. Meese was originally proposed  on Tuesday. We have been on  this  matter 4 days now.  What is really the fact here is that  the Members on the other side wish to  determine the agenda. I hear flowery  things  said  about  the  majority  leader-our wonderful friend, how we  admire him. All  that apparently  is  true. But they do not wish to permit  the majority leader to determine the  agenda, the way every majority leader  in the past has done. When we started  the session in January, the majority  leader said that the first piece of busi ness would be the nomination of Mr.  Meese. But, no,  that is not satisfac tory. A group on the other side said.  ""No,  that  is not  for  the majority  leader to determine, as it has always  been in the past. We are going to de termine that agenda.""  That is  the crucial matter here. It  has nothing to do with farmers. It has  nothing to do with the nomination of  Mr. Meese. The point before us is who  is going to run the show-the majority  leader or a group over there who seem  to have taken charge? So this is a very  important point.  This is not the first time we have  dealt with  this matter. People have  spoken on this in the past. As I men tioned earlier, we had  the situation  some 6 years ago when we were in the  minority. We had about 38 or 39 Mem bers. Suddenly, we  determined one  evening that we were going to adjourn.  Onto the floor, rightfully, stormed the  majority  leader,  now  the minority  leader.  He said: ""This is nonsense. Who is  going to run the place? Somebody has  to run this show.""  He was right, and we did not prevail,  obviously.  So we  are back  in  the  situation  where  the majority  leader now,  the  distinguished Senator  from Kansas,  has said what the agenda is going to  be. But that is not satisfactory. They  do not want it that way. They want it  differently.  They have  legitimate concerns for  the  farmers, which  they have  ex pressed time and time again. But those  concerns are not any greater on that  side than they are here. We have farm  States  represented  just as much as  over there. I  think I can speak with  some objectivity, since no one has ever  accused Rhode Island of being a farm  State. But I am prepared, as others  are here who have no immediate in volvement with the problems,  to get  on with the farm matter in the course  of the agenda as the majority leader  has stated. No one here can quarrel  with his concern and his knowledge  about farm matters.  So, Mr. President,  I hope we can  move to the nomination of Mr. Meese  and that it can be done quickly. As a  matter of fact, I have understood that  those on the other side have offered a  1-hour time limitation, and I cannot  understand why they are conducting a  filibuster.  Last night,  somebody got up and  started reading through editorial after  editorial-""A"" for Abilene, and I do  not know what the last one was. That  is no way to run this place. We should  get on with the problems before us.  This is just a start.  It seems to me that the urgency of  what we are doing here now is not this  particular matter. This  is  important  enough. But the urgency, the crucial  point, is how we are going to run the  Senate. This is going to come up time  and time again. I ref er Senators to the  history by  the now minority  leader  about the powers of the  leaders, of  which he spoke eloquently in one of  his history lessons here. In the course  of that, he has pointed out that one of  the duties of the majority leader is to  set  the  agenda,  the procedure,  by  which we conduct business.  That is what we are seeking here  now. If we do not settle this now, if we  let the minority, or a minority of the  minority  set  the agenda-I do not  know who  is  running  things  over  there-if we let them determine what  is going to come up, so it will be with  every issue.  The majority leader might say that  we are going to deal with a treaty, and  suddenly over there they will say, ""No,  we don't want that, we want to move  to school prayer.'' Well,  if you want  total chaos, all of us came through the  last session discouraged by  the way  this place was running, and we sought  some reforms. Some reforms, modest  though they might be, have been en acted. But this will be  the greatest  step back that this Chamber has ever  seen, if the majority leader cannot de termine what comes to the floor.  Mr. President,  this is of deep con cern to me and, I think, to others here.  I hope that the minority, who have  ",1985
134,418,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, may we  have order?  ",1985
135,418,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Will  Senators cease  their conversation so  that the minority leader may explain  the interpretation of the unanimous consent agreement?  ,1985
136,418,3,Mr. BYRD.," I thank the Chair and I  thank  the  distinguished  majority  leader. There would be no  amend ments  that are not relevant  to  the  farm issue, with the added provision  that will  allow amendments  in  the  first and second degree anent appro priations. No point of order would lie  against that particular type of amend ment.  Mr. President,  the colloquy would  then ensue between Mr. BYRD, Mr.  DOLE, and Mr. COCHRAN, and I would  hope we would allow any other Sena tor to also participate in that colloquy  because everyone has to be satisfied  with respect to the timing of the Afri can  relief  appropriations  bill, H.R.  1239.  Moreover, Mr. DOLE and I have en tered  into a gentleman's agreement  which would provide  that when the  Senate turns to the consideration of S.  457, the African relief bill, that busi ness will  stay before  the Senate unless  the  two  leaders agree other wise-until that bill is finally disposed  of, however long that takes.  Now, the words ""disposed of"" could  involve an up or down vote, could in volve passage of the measure, could in volve rejection of the measure, could  involve tabling the measure, could in volve  indefinitely  postponing  the  measure. These are ways of ""dispos ing"" of  the matter. As  I often said  with respect to Mr. Baker, if I had his  word, I could walk off the floor and  know that that word would be kept. I  had no  concern about Mr. Baker's  promises when he assured me that I  did not have  to stay on  the  floor.  ""This is all that will be done,"" he said,  and I never found that faith broken. I  feel exactly the same way about ",1985
137,418,3,Mr.  DOLE.," He and I have arrived at that  understanding, and I hope  that our  colleagues will be happy with that. As  a matter of fact, I would rather have  that understanding than to attempt to  tie  it down  in a unanimous consent  HATFIELD,  agreement which might be consider ably difficult to achieve.  So, Mr. President, I thank the distin guished majority leader and all Sena tors on both sides of the aisle who  have participated in this difficult exer cise. I believe that we are soon reach ing the end of it. Senators on both  sides of the aisle are to be highly com plimented on  their diligence,  their  dedication to their duty, and on the  fine manner in which they, generally,  have conducted their debate.  ",1985
138,418,3,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  there objection?  ,1985
139,418,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, to fill out  the balance of the agreement, I will  ask  the distinguished Senator  from  Mississippi  to  indicate what  action  may be expected on H.R. 1239.  ",1985
140,418,3,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President,  if  the distinguished Senator will yield, it  is the intention of the subcommittee  with jurisdiction to take that bill to  the committee for markup, probably  on the Tuesday following the House  action that is planned for this coming  Thursday. This would be a markup  session in the full committee on Ap propriations on Tuesday, March 5.  The chairman of the full committee,  Senator  who  has  just  stepped off the floor, has indicated to  me that it is his intention to deal with  that matter as expeditiously as PoSSi ble and to request that the matter be  taken up on the floor of the Senate as  soon as it can be scheduled following  the work of the Committee on Appro priations.  ",1985
141,418,3,Mr. BUMPERS., Will  the Senator  from Mississippi yield for a question?  ,1985
142,418,3,Mr. COCHRAN., The majority leader  has the floor. I would be happy to re spond to a question.  ,1985
143,418,3,Mr. DOLE., I will be happy to yield.  ,1985
144,418,3,Mr. BUMPERS.," It is my understand ing, for the benefit of our colleagues,  that that bill does not contain food  relief  for Africa,  that  it  is support  services and so on,  that we are not  holding up the shipment of food  to  starving Ethiopians; is that correct?  ",1985
145,418,3,Mr. COCHRAN.,"  If the majority  leader will yield,  the appropriations  bill does contain money to fund the  Public Law 480 program, and that part  of the money will be used to purchase  food. Other parts of the appropriation  will be used to pay for the shipment of  food. Then there  is another section  that involves disaster aid and refugee  assistance under  the  jurisdiction of  the Foreign Operations Committee. So  this is the appropriations bill that the  administration is requesting to provide  famine  assistance  to  sub-Sahara  Africa.  ",1985

I  compliment the majority  leader and  minority leader for propounding this  request. As one who has been involved  in the parliamentary maneuvers the  last several days, I  feel we have al ready made some progress on helping  the farmers. More needs to be done.  But I believe  this agreement will  give us the opportunity for consider ation of additional measures that we  have all earnestly sought. I am also so  pleased to see this agreement conclud ed  in a manner which  I  think en hances the spirit of bipartisanship and  cooperative attitude that we hope we  can build in the Senate, an attitude of  comity and trust that will help us deal  with other problems in the future.  Mr. President, I compliment both of  our  leaders  for  propounding  this  agreement and for obtaining it in a  manner that I think bodes well for the  future of this body as we deal not only  with the farm problem but other very  difficult matters that we are going to  confront in the future.

170,431,3,Mr.  STAFFORD.," Mr.  President,  once  again  I  come before my col leagues with legislation which would  approve an  interstate cost estimate  CICEl and interstate substitute cost es timate CISCEJ. The Interstate High way Funding Act of 1985 is an original  bill-S. 391-reported by the Commit tee on Environment and Public Works  on January 29, 1985. However,  it  is  very similar to S. 3024 which passed  the Senate last October. Congressional  passage of S. 391 would release to the  States $7 billion in already authorized  and long overdue funding and provide  for the administrative release of such  funds in the future.  The $7 billion figure represents 18  months of backlogged interstate con struction funds  totaling $5.3 billion,  interstate  substitute  highway  and  transit funding of $780 million, and  approximately $972 million in 85 per cent minimum allocation funds. All of  this $7 billion should have been made  available to the States in fiscal year  1984.  The situation is now so critical with  46 States unable to do any interstate  highway work and the possible loss of  a second straight construction season  that I hope all extraneous issues can  be set aside and the ICE and ISCE  quickly approved. The entire Federal Aid Highway Program must be reau thorized  in  fiscal year 1986, and  I  would there! ore urge my colleagues in  the Senate and in the House of Repre sentatives to lay aside other highway  issues until we have the opportunity  to consider them next year.  There are  two major changes be tween S. 178, which I joined with Sen ator  SYMMs  and  other  committee  members in introducing on the first  day of the 99th Congress, and S. 391,  an original bill reported by the com mittee on January 29. First, given the  serious concern over the magnitude of  the Federal budget deficit, the com mittee unanimously agreed  to  lower  the fiscal year 1986 obligation ceiling  for the highway program from $14.45  billion, as authorized in the Surface  Transportation Assistance Act of 1982,  to $12.75 billion, which represents a  freeze at the fiscal year 1985 level of  $13.25 billion plus an additional $500  million cut.  Second, committee members agreed  to delete 14 demonstration projects  worth approximately $150 million in  new Federal spending. Many of those  highway projects are very meritorious  and all met the guidelines developed  by the committee which limited the  maximum Federal share to 50 percent  of the total project cost or $12.5 mil lion, whichever was less. However, the  committee found  it inappropriate at  this time to authorize any new spend ing when the entire program is being  cut back.  Mr. President, ICE/ISCE legislation  is once again available for consider ation thanks to the vigorous efforts of  many concerned Senators. I especially  appreciate  the  untiring  efforts  of  Transportation Subcommittee Chair man SYMMs, and Senator BENTSEN and  Senator BURDICK,  ranking minority  members on the full committee and  subcommittee.  The need for release of these funds  becomes more urgent by the day. Ap proval of the interstate estimates is of  bipartisan  and  national  interest.  I  hope my colleagues will give favorable  consideration to S. 391-the Interstate  Highway Funding Act of 1985.  Mr. President, I want to clarify two  items contained  in subsection <e> of  section 129 contained in S. 391. This  provision is intended to allow several  States  to obligate a  limited amount  outside the obligational limitation in  fiscal year 1985. The provision is limit ed to those States who turned back ob ligational authority on August 1, 1984,  expressly because the interstate cost  estimate and interstate substitute cost  estimate had not been approved and,  therefore, did not have sufficient ap portionments to use this obligational  authority in fiscal year 1984. The af fected States and the amount of ap portionments and  allocations which  would not be subject to the fiscal year  1985  obligational  limitation  are:  $6,300,000 for Alabama, $6,000,000 for  Connecticut, $58,386,451  for Florida,  $17,708,000  for  New  Jersey,  $16,795,645  for Oklahoma, $7,000,000  for Utah, and $7,588,433 for West Vir ginia. It is the committee's intent that  section  129<e>  only  applies  to  the  States I have  just listed and to the  amounts I have  just listed for each  State.  ",1985
171,431,3,Mr. STAFFORD.," Mr. President,  I  yield  to  the  distinguished Senator  from Idaho.  ",1985
172,431,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Idaho is recognized.  ,1985
173,431,3,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, I will be  very brief in my remarks and try to  address concisely what is in this bill  for  those Senators or members of  their staffs who happen to be listening  in.  Mr. President,  I  thank Chairman  STAFFORD and the ranking members,  Senators BENTSEN  and BURDICK,  for  their efforts, and the members of the  committee, in presenting this legisla tion. I thank the Senate for giving us  the opportunity so early this year to  be able to vote on this legislation, S.  391, the Interstate Highway Funding  Act of 1985.  Mr. President, I am pleased we have  an opportunity so early in the year to  vote on the highway legislation laid  before us today. Passage of S. 391, the  Interstate Highway Funding Act of  1985, would provide congressional ap proval of the interstate cost estimate  CICEl  and  the  interstate substitute  cost estimate CISCEl and, thereby, re lease over $7 billion in interstate con struction  and  interstate  substitute  funds. The urgent need  for  these  funds cannot be overstated, and I com mend my colleagues on the Environ ment and Public Works Committee for  their  expeditions  consideration  and  approval of  this bill. Senator STAF FORD,  the distinguished chairman of  the committee, has moved quickly to  bring the legislation to the floor, and I  ",1985
174,444,3,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I would  like today to express my support for  the passage of a clean interstate cost  estimate bill. Currently $39.3 million  in  interstate construction funds and  $58. 7 million  in minimum allocation  funds are being withheld from Okla homa's construction program due  to  the delay in approving the ICE.  Each month of delay  erodes  the  buying  power  of  the  construction  dollar and adds to the cost of complet ing critical interstate and other high way projects which could be financed  with minimum allocation funds. Re lease of our State's apportionment of  these Federal funds will allow Oklaho ma to initiate over $100 million in new  construction projects which will  in  turn  create  jobs  beneficial  to my  State's faltering economy.  Mr.  President, Oklahoma  is  not  alone in her desire to see quick pas sage of a clean ICE bill. There are no  fewer than 12 States that are suffer ing from the withholding of interstate  construction funds as well as the lack  of a timely release of over $1 billion in  minimum allocation funds which are  dependent upon the approval of the  ICE bill.  Mr. President, I would urge my col leagues to consider the merits of this  legislation and vote for its final pas sage.  ",1985
175,444,3,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  it is  well past time we ratified an interstate  cost estimate CICEl and interstate sub stitute cost estimate CISCEl bill.  I have long favored a bill like S. 391  that frees up funds for approved high way construction without costly pork  barrel projects. The bill approves the  ICE for the second half of fiscal year  1985 and for all of fiscal year 1986.  Interstate construction all across our  Nation has come to a virtual standstill  because of inaction, shortsightedness,  and irresponsibility. The State of Wis consin,  like many other States, has  been held hostage to those in Congress  who are only interested in promoting  themselves and their last minute, spe cial projects. In the process, they have  managed to ignore the well-being and  health of our Nation's interstate high ways.  How long must the people of Wis consin wait for highway  funds  that  they  have  contributed  toward  and  which are rightly theirs? The f allure  of Congress to act decisively on inter state funding has resulted in the loss  of $96 million (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  figures used by Senator DoLE on Feb ruary 20,  1985)  to Wisconsin alone,  and has jeopardized close to 60 crucial  highway projects now designated  in  my State for const!""uction and repairs.  Without these funds, it is impossible  for Wisconsin to begin to plan for its  spring and summer construction peri ods. Spring may arrive late in Wausau,  but this kind of delay  is  ridiculous.  Let's not forget the full consequences  of our delay on this issue. Not only  will  the traveling public suffer from  unbuilt and unrepaired  roads;  thou sands  of  construction workers will  remain  unemployed  after  an  idle  winter. Tens of thousands of smaller  businesses and suppliers who provide  construction materials will suffer un necessarily. In Wisconsin alone, almost  5,000 jobs are at stake.  Parliamentary gimmicks and quick sand amendments have made quick  action on this legislation  impossible.  Last year, costly transit projects and  tunnels attached in the House delayed  final passage of a similar bill. At that  time, I called on House conferees to  put aside parochial  interests so we  could get essential highway projects  moving  again. Unfortunately,  they  failed to do so.  I urge the Senate to act responsibly  by acting immediately. Time is at a  premium. There is no more time for  deliberations  in  the  huddle.  The  House, too, must play ball or face the  consequences of forfeiture.  I want to thank Senator DOLE for his  strong leadership in bringing this bill  up for a vote on the floor, and Sena tors STAFFORD, SYMMS, and BENTSEN on  the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee for their fine work.  I ask the majority leadership in the  House to show the same strength and  resolve by doing what is clearly right  for the American people.  Mr. President, as an original cospon sor of this bill, I am ready to vote im mediately, because  I know  that for  every additional hour that is wasted  here in Washington, another day will  slip by before  roads and bridges  in  Wisconsin are repaired and the safety  of travelers in Wisconsin and through out the country is ensured.  Thank you.  ",1985
176,444,3,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  in support of  the  Interstate  Highway Funding Act of 1985. I am  pleased to do so because this bill ap proves  the release of the  interstate  cost estimate CICEl and the interstate  substitute cost estimate CISCEl which  have  been  unnecessarily  delayed.  Many of  the State of Ohio's badly  needed highway projects have been  postponed  until  Congress  releases  these essential funds.  In the past, approval of the ICE has  been a fairly routine matter. During  the past 2 years, however, Congress  has had difficulty reaching an agree ment on an ICE and ISCE approval.  This difficulty arose, Mr. President,  because of disputes over funding for mulas and parochial projects connect ed with ICE legislation. These disputes  have accomplished little and have cost  a great deal. My own State of Ohio  has had nearly $250 million dollars  held hostage because representatives  from other States have been unable to  resist  the  temptation  to attach pet  projects to this legislation.  The result of such congressional bot tlenecks is that our transportation in frastructure,  the  foundation  upon  which our economy is built, continues  to crumble. Our roads are breaking up  and our bridges  are  falling  down.  These problems will only grow worse  through neglect and, as  these prob lems grow, our economic productivity  will continue to decline. We can begin  to make progress in these as soon as  we pass a clean ICE.  Today, the Senate will be taking an  appropriate first step in that direction.  The legislation we are considering con tains not only an 18-month ICE, it di rects the Secretary of Transportation  to release the interstate construction  and substitute funds administratively  if Congress has not approved an ICE  and ISCE by October 1. In light of the  problems we have encountered in the  past, I feel this is a reasonable solu tion and I urge its immediate support.  PASSAGE OF THE ICE IS URGENTLY NEEDED  ",1985
177,444,3,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, our  Nation's highways are already pitted  by potholes. There are both controlla ble and uncontrollable causes for this  tragedy. As we all know, this has been  an unusually harsh winter, with pre dictable results for our Nation's high ways. Soon the thaws, freezing rains  and downpours of  late winter and  early spring will worsen that damage  to our streets and highways. As all of  us know, potholes are a serious traffic  safety hazard.  In densely populated  urban areas or out in rural townships,  a traveler's safety is jeopardized when  repairs are not made in a timely fash ion. We cannot control the weather,  but we can respond in a rational way  to its ravages.  A  few  years  ago,  the Congress  showed tremendous interest in our Na tion's  crumbling  infrastructure,  cluding  speedy  repair of highways,  bridges and completion of the Inter state System. For the past 18 months,  however, we have shown too little of  that concern. In fact, we have done  nothing to address  this pressing na tional problem.  There are construction workers  in  my State who desperately want  to  work. There are contractors who are  ready  to begin projects. There are  State highway officials who have long  lists of projects that need to be done.  State and local governments are ready  and able to cooperate with the Federal  Government. For once, the problem is  not that there is no money to make  these repairs or to begin new projects.  In fact, $7 .2 billion is in the highway  trust fund. The failure to repair our  Nation's streets  and  highways  can  only be blamed on the Congress of the  United States.  in ",1985
178,457,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to be a cosponsor of this sense of-the-Senate  resolution  offered  by  the distinguished Senator from South  Dakota, Senator ABDNOR. The provi sions of this resolution reflect the ef forts of Senators from farm States on  both sides of the aisle, and will do  much  to  assist  financially  pressed  farmers  to obtain needed operating  capital in advance of spring planting  this year. It also reflects the coopera tion and support of the administra tion, which agreed  to  implement  its  provisions yesterday.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a summary of the main pro visions of this resolution be printed at  the end of my remarks. I would only  add two items at this point, recogniz ing that the discussion of the farm  credit issue is apparently going to con tinue when the Senate reconvenes on  Monday and takes up the Africa relief  bill.  .  First, I  think we should all realize  that  spring  planting  time  is  just  around the corner for many farmers.  Spring crops  in Kansas are planted  mostly in April, and farmers arrange  their  financing  well  before  then.  Other parts of the country plant even  earlier. So I  think no one should be  under the illusion that we are going to  be able to pass new legislation, go to  conference with any of the bills that  are pending in the House, and produce  a bill acceptable to the administration  in time to be signed into law and im plemented this spring.  The second point, Mr. President, is  that no matter how generous or con cern~d we are here in Washington and I know and respect the concerns  of many of my colleagues on both  sides of  the aisle on this subject-I  think we all know  that the current  problems in American agricultur.e are  deeply rooted in long-term conditions  in our domestic and international agri cultural economic situations. We can  provide emergency credit now, and we  can get some  farmers planted wh~  might otherwise not have  found  fi nancing. But we cannot use the same  band-aid approach to dealing with the  basic problems facing this basic Ameri can industry.  Mr. President, we will shortly be en gaged in work on the new farm bill.  There are other areas in agriculture  which we may also need to become  more involved in this year. I only hope  we can address these issues in a funda mental and meaningful way, and not  gloss over the problems or just try to  throw money at them. For one thing,  we do not have the money. We have a  large Federal debt and growing defi cits and debt service payments. For an other I believe our farmers are about  out ~f patience with our traditional  shortsighted responses to farm prob lems, and that they want some real an swers for a change.  So, Mr. President, I would close by  calling on the administration to make  a priority of implementing the various  provisions of  this  resolution and of  their  Debt  Adjustment  Program.  What we do inside the beltway is only  as useful and beneficial as the eff ec tiveness with which laws and regula tions are administered. And to be ef fective, these programs must be quick ly and fully administered in the next  few weeks.  Thank you, Mr. President.  There being no objection, the sum mary was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  PROVISIONS OF SENSEOF SENATE RESOLUTION  ON FARM CREDIT  1. Adequate loan guarantees will be made  available under the September Debt Adjust ment Program to meet demand by lending  institutions to refinance farmers this spring.  2. The cash-flow requirement for farmers  to be eligible for commercial loan restruc turing under the Debt Adjustment Program  is reduced from 110% to 100%.  3. Adequate credit will be made available  under  the Farmers Home Administration  Insured <Direct) Operating Loan Program  to meet demand in 1985.  4. The percentage of  loan guaranteed  under the interest concession option will be  increased yearly to a maximum of 90% of  principal.  5. Applications for FmHA loans and loan  guarantees will be expedited <FmHA has an nounced that 1,000 additional loan officers  are being reassigned to work on the current  case backlog.)  6. Action on loan application decisions by  approved lenders will be required within 15  days action on FmHA loan and loan guar ante~ requests will be processed within 60  days, to the fullest extent possible.  7. Federal and State regulatory agencies  are encouraged to exercise restraint and for ebearance in making adverse classifications  with respect to agricultural loans.  ",1985
179,457,3,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, the  Senate has been involved during the  last week or so,  in efforts to resolve  the  problems  facing  the American  farmer. Make no mistake about it, the  problems are real, and in fact, grave  for many American men, women, and  children who work and live in one of  the most productive  sectors of our  economy. Unfortunately, history  re veals  that when we  lose  the family  farmer, he rarely returns to the land  on which his family lived and farmed.  Thus, when we lose our family farmer,  we lose part of our history, our very  heritage.  When we have gone as far as to bail  out Chrysler, New York City,  the  International Monetary Fund, Conti nental Bank, and many others, I must  ask, ""Why shouldn't we go that extra  step and help our own people, our own  farmers, who are in need of assistance  now more than ever?"" When a farmer  sees that we have bailed out others,  how do you think he must feel; he sees  those other actions as bailouts, but  what we are doing in this resolution is  not-we are talking about investment  in America which means insurance for  the future.  Unlike many others  that we have  helped, the farmer and rancher must  contend with many  factors  totally  beyond his control. Sure, many of our  nonagricultural businesses can also be  affected by weather conditions,  irre sponsible Government actions, pests,  diseases, and other factors, but none  have to deal with all of these threats  at once, any one of which could to~ally  destroy their business. When consider ing  these  factors,  it makes perfect  sense to me to do all that is in our  power to assist our own people who,  through their own ingenuity and per serverence, have become such~ funda mental  segment  of  our  society.  those bail outs,  to which I have re ferred earlier, were viewed as ben~fi­ cial to our country, surely some assist ance to our farmers and ranchers is in  order. I would rather guarantee a loan  or provide some other assistance to an  American farmer than bail out some  international  fund which  does not  If  ",1985
180,470,3,Mr. CROCKETT.," Mr. Speaker, the  recent governmental actions in South  Africa-18 persons killed in the black  crossroads squatter camp outside of  Capetown and the arrest on charges of  treason of six  leaders of the United  Democratic Front, an alliance seeking  nonviolent change-once again high lights South Africa's determination to  maintain  its  repressive  apartheid  system at all costs.  They also serve notice to this Con gress and the people of the United  States  that  the Reagan administra tion's foreign policy on South Africa that of constructive engagement-has  made no significant  inroads, has re ceived no substantive concessions, has  fostered no meaningful  changes  in  that country's dedication  to  racism,  and has, in fact, given both encourage ment and strength to those forces op posing any type of peaceful reform.  It is time for this administration to  make clear to South Africa that the  United States can no longer be a silent  partner to its practice of state support ed  terrorism,  systematically  visited  upon its 22 million black South Afri cans. We can do this most effectively  by indicating now that American dol lars will no longer be available to a  country that practices such inhuman ity to man. In short, now's the time to  halt  any  further American  invest ments in South Africa; and now is the  time to push for a timely withdrawal  of all U.S. firms doing business there.  THE SO-CALLED AMERICAN  MIRACLE  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his  remarks and  include extraneous  matter.>  ",1985
181,470,3,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, all  of us in this House welcome economic  growth and prosperity. However, Mr.  Reagan's description of his policies as  ""An American Miracle"" has to make  even the most rock rib Republican, a  little squeemish.  Let there be no misunderstanding Mr.  Reagan  and  his  Republican  friends  are  financing  this  so-called  miracle by borrowing $200 billion a  year. In 4 short years, Mr. Reagan and  his Republican friends have managed  to double the national debt. By 1988,  they want to triple it. The only mirac ulous  thing about  this borrow-and spend policy is that Mr. Reagan is still  getting away with it.  Mr. Speaker, an editorial in today's  Washington  Post  refers  to  these  borrow-and-spend policies as ""The Ro mantic School of Economic Thought.""  Mr.  Reagan  and  his  Republican  friends would be well-advised to read  this warning and be  advised: That  which is for us today an ""Economic  Miracle,"" bears for our children the  seeds of an ""Economic Nightmare.""  THE ""AMERICAN MIRACLE""  Americans' incomes and economic output  rose  strongly  in 1984. The government's  scorekeepers have  just  revised  the GNP  numbers upward once again, and President  Reagan celebrated them in the preamble to  his  press  conference Thursday  evening.  That will set off another round in the inter esting debate over the reasons for this pow erful and gratifying performance.  Mr. Reagan has no doubts. He attributes  the ""American miracle"" to tax cuts, incen tives and the unleashed spirit of free enter prise. Now the country is embarked, in his  view, on the sustained growth that he prom ised four years ago.  That's the Romantic School of economic  thought-optimistic, ebullient and attrac tive. But perhaps you ought to ask for a  second opinion. There's another explana tion that's a little less uplifting but tighter  in its logic.  Federal budget deficits speed up economic  growth, at least for a while. That's basic  Keynesian economics. Governments discov ered in the late 1930s that it works, and  have been using it ever since-none more  vigorously and unapologetically  than Mr.  Reagan's. He points out that the country's  growth rate last year was the highest since  1951. Quite true. But for 21h years the coun try has been running the largest federal de ficts since 1946.  The curious thing about the Reagan ad ministration's strategy is the fidelity with  which it seems to be following the model of  the 1960s,  the Kennedy-Johnson years. It  was a time not only of extraordinarily high  economic growth, at least through 1966, but  of unbroken growth. There was no recession  from 1961 to 1969, by far the longest cycle  of growth  in the past generation. In Mr.  Reagan's first term, he gave great emphasis  to the 1964 tax cut as the precedent for his  own cuts. But by 1966 the strongest influ ence on the economy, prolonging the expan sion, was the military buildup for the Viet nam War. The present rise in defense spend ing may similarly extend Mr. Reagan's ex pansion.  Defense spending in the mid-1980s is not  nearly as high, as either a share of the  budget or of the country's total output, as it  was in the late 1960s. The Reagan proposals  would not raise it to that level even by the  end of the decade.  But while President Reagan's defense  spending is lower than President Johnson's  was,  his deficits  are much bigger. This  year's deficit, the administration says, will  be 5.7 percent of GNP. Mr. Johnson's larg est deficit was 3 percent of GNP, at the  height of the war in 1968. That was  the  year, incidentally, when inflation got out of  control, to the great cost of Mr. Johnson's  successors.  Mr. Reagan claims to have put the Ameri can economy on an altogether new and  higher track. But so far it appears to be fol lowing a familiar historical pattern.

188,522,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, ""Let's Talk  With Castro"" is the title of an excel lent and prescient Op-Ed piece written  by Representative BILL ALExANDER in  a recent issue of the New York Times  and also is a sentiment which I have  expressed myself over the past years,  especially since my  trip  to Cuba  in  1974 with Senator Javits. As a result  of two recent trips to Cuba, the last  one in January when he and Repre sentative JIM LEAcH spent a  total of  over 38 hours with the Cuban Presi dent, Congressman ALEXANDER believes  that  the  administration  should  re spond positively to Cuba's conciliatory  overtures to the United States.  My colleagues know that I have been  a strong advocate of normalizing rela tions with Cuba, because I believe that  could improve the prospects of reduc ing Cuba's intervention  in  the area.  One immediate result of normalization  would  likely  be  the  reduction  in  Cuba's spewing of harsh invective and  hatred  in  the  region  against  the  United States. It is no wonder that  Cuba feels so bitter toward the United  States since this Nation has attempted  to assassinate its leaders, has launched  one large invasion of that nation and  who knows how many minor ones, and  has done its best to isolate Cuba from  its neighbors  in  the Western Hemi sphere.  The agreement on immigration, con cluded in December and now being im plemented,  is a  stark demonstration  that the United States and Cuba can  deal with each other on matters of  mutual concern and  interest. Let us  build on the momentum begun by the  agreement and see if Fidel Castro is  serious about his expressed willingness  to talk about other issues of mutual  concern, which could hold out  the  prospect  for  a  peace  settlement  in  Central America and a  reduction of  tensions  in  southern Africa.  This  theme also is stressed in the Alexan der article which I highly recommend  to my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that this excellent  article by Representative BILL ALEX ANDER from the February 14 edition of  the New York Times be printed in full  at this point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  LET's TALK WITH CASTRO  <By William V. Alexander, Jr.>  WASHINGTON.-President  Reagan  would  make a serious mistake if he rejected the  conciliatory offer tendered this month by  Fidel Castro.  The Cuban leader's message is clear: he  wants to lessen tensions between Cuba and  the United States. This, he hopes, will give  Cuba access to United States markets and  improve  the prospect  that entrepreneurs  will take advantage of Cuba's new law per mitting  foreign  investment.  In exchange,  President Castro seems willing to cooperate  in bringing about a political solution  to  problems in Central America and Africa.  My recent trips to Cuba,  in August and  January,  convince me  that Mr. Castro  means business. For all his Communist ide ology, he is a shrewd observer of interna tional economic trends and he looks with  some envy on the developing relationship  between the United States and the People's  Republic of China.  Economically,  things are not going well  for Cuba. At present, the Soviet Union is  subsidizing the Cuban economy at the rate  of some $4 billion to $4.5 billion annually.  Yet Moscow is apparently reluctant to in crease its aid, and Mr. Castro fears that the  help may eventually stop altogether. Even  with that help, which need not be repaid,  Cuba's foreign debt is said to range between  $10 billion and $12 billion-more than its es timated gross national product.  President Castro's proposed solution is a  20 percent increase in exports to Western  nations that pay in hard currency. Cuban  leaders are also particularly  interested in  joint ventures  that would yield manufac tured products for export.  For 25 years, Fidel Castro has pushed the  Cuban  economy  toward  industralization,  with  limited success. Agricultural exports  dominate, as they did before the revolution.  Food and consumer goods are rationed. Low  productivity  remains  a  problem  despite  measures to encourage decentralized man agement.  The country's economic problems are also  compounded by politics. The new genera tion-more than half the population-was  born after Mr. Castro came to power and is  particularly impatient for signs of economic  progress. The new law allowing Cubans to  own their own homes, and the appearance  of supermarkets stocked with scarce con sumer goods, were undoubtedly designed to  satisfy  this generation while spurring  in creased productivity among all workers. The  resumption of economic relations with the  United States would be the next logical step  in this direction.  We might begin to move toward a thaw by  opening talks on several immediate points  of tension. In particular, Mr. Castro is will ing to discuss aircraft hijacking, radio inter ference caused by overlapping broadcast fre quencies, mutual assistance  for distressed  ships and disputes over common  fishing  grounds. The United States has an interest  in making  progress  on  all  four  issues,  whether or not negotiations  led  to some thing bigger.  If, however,  the  talks did go well, we  should be encouraged to take up Mr. Cas tro's offer to work together to find a peace ful resolution to tensions in Central Amer ica and Africa.  For openers, Mr. Castro says he would  agree  in advance  to  the concept of third  party ""verificaiton"" of compliance with any  Central American treaty negotiated by the  Contadora  Group-Colombia,  Mexico,  Panama and Venezuela. This would indeed  be a significant step toward peace, for the  absence of a verificaiton provision was the  stated reason that the United States reject ed the first Contadora treaty proposal.  Surely it is in the United States' interest  to pursue  this offer. Both Cuba and the  Soviet Union consider  that  they have a  major stake in the future of Central Amer ica and the rest of the Western Hemisphere.  Until now, Washington has seen  this as  something necessary  threatening. It need  not be. Would it not after all be in our inter est to lessen tensions with the only country  in the hemisphere with a military facility at  the disposal of the Soviet Union? What's  more, if we can negotiate with the Russians,  surely we can talk with the Cubans. What  do we have to lose?  Lessening tensions between our two coun tries through cultural exchanges and, even tually,  trade,  could  also  strengthen  the  bonds created by our common cultural her itage.  In  the  long  run,  such  exchanges  might even be an opportunity  to export  American  political  ideals  to Cuba. Our  nation  has  200  years  of  experience  in  making the American Revolution work-and  we should be willing to share the wisdom of  this experience. Let us be big enough, as a  nation, to invite Mr. Castro and the Cuban  people to the conference table.  SENATOR QUAYLE'S CONTRIBU TION TO SENATE REFORM  ",1985
189,522,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, now that  we have  finally  resolved  the assign ments to the so-called A committees of  the Senate,  I would  like  to  take a  moment to commend the Junior Sena tor from Indiana, Senator QUAYLE, for  his  diligent  efforts  to bring  about  reform  of  the  Senate  committee  system.  As chairman of the temporary Select  Committee To Study the Senate Com mittee System, Senator QUAYLE faced  a formidable task. Although most Sen ators perceived the need for reform to  mJ.ke the Senate more efficient, there  was and continues to be strong resist ance to many of the specific changes  needed  to bring about such reform.

I wanted to announce that my col league from South Dakota is the prin cipal cosponsor, along with my friend,  the distinguished senior Senator from  Iowa [Mr. GRASSLEY] and that he will  be making remarks in due time. But I  take it the Senator does not care to  make remarks at this time.  ",1985

195,535,3,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  want to ask the Senator from Nebras ka for a clarification of this amend ment.  As the Senator is aware, the Bank of  America has its own proposal to assist  those farmers who can show an ability  to survive in the long run if they are  provided financial assistance to work  through their current financial prob lems. The bank's proposal,  like  the  Senator's amendment,  is  targeted  to  those farmers with potential positive  cash-flow  on  current  operations.  Under the Bank of America proposal,  commercial banks would provide 100  percent of  the  loan,  fully collatera lized by the farmer's assets and antici pated  income.  The  banks  would  assume the risk for the first 80 per cent of the loan. The Federal Govern ment would guarantee the top 20 per cent of the farmer's loan-with a max imum guarantee of $450,000. Under  this proposal, many banks would be  encouraged to make loans they other wise would not make. And the Federal  Government should have full opportu nity to recover if there is a default,  since the farmer would have 100 per cent support for his  loan. This ap proach has a distinct advantage,  in  that with this lower 20 percent guar antee, the Federal Government would  be able to provide support for more  than four times as many farmers as  could be served by a 90-percent guar antee with the same amount of funds.  It is my understanding that the ad ministration has the authority to im plement the Bank of America's pro posal without further legislation. It is  also my understanding that adminis trative implementation of this propos al is not precluded by the Zorinsky  amendment.  I know that there are differences of  opinion over whether or not this ap proach should be undertaken, and of  course I would expect that it would  not be undertaken until there was con siderable agreement from  those who  would be affected that it should be un dertaken. So I am not asking if this  would be done at once. I do not expect  that it would be. But I am asking this:  Could it be if it were agreed upon as a  wise course of action under pending  laws and under the Zorinsky amend ment? I would appreciate it if the Sen ator  from Nebraska would  confirm  this for me.  ",1985
196,535,3,Mr. ZORINSKY.," The Senator from  California is correct. The administra tion has the authority, and this au thority is unchanged by the pending  amendment.  ",1985
197,535,3,Mr. CRANSTON., I appreciate that  very much. That is most helpful.  ,1985

201,600,3,Mr.  SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, each  year  in our  review of  the military  budgets, we hear of high technology  programs associated with billions of  dollars,  complex  instrumentation,  computerized  to  the  umpteenth  degree, with associated  interface re quirements, and a  long R&D evolu tion. All of which makes Congress and  DOD sensitive to cost overruns. How ever, this past year a military program  reached fruition under cost, on sched ule, and without fanfare. I believe this  program could easily be described as  the single greatest enhancement  to  combat readiness in recent years-the  M16A2, combat rifle for our infantry men.  The M16A2 program is a  textbook  success story from the standpoint of  identifying the requirement and exe cuting a program at minimal cost. In  1979 the Marine Corps saw the need to  commence a program that would ulti mately lead to the production of a new  service  rifle,  replacing  the  aged  M16Al. The significance of this pro gram  lies  in  the fact  that the real  users of the weapon executed the pro gram. Although  the  program  fell  under the administrative parameters  of the Joint Services Small Arms Pro gram, the U.S. Marine Corps took the  lead with support from Army person nel during the operational tests and  evaluations. The close cooperation be tween the Marine Corps, Army, and  Colt Industries allowed the military to  design,  test, make changes, and test  again until the final product was ap proved  for service use by both  the  Army and the Marine Corps.  The importance of this program lies  in  the  fact  that  there  is only one  single weapon capable of seizing and  holding key terrain and that is the sol dier or marine armed with his rifle.  I would like to recognize with all our  service men and women those key indi viduals of  this highly important and  successful program: Lt. Col. Charles  Pyle, USMC; Lt. Col. David Lutz,  USMC; Maj. Michael Smith, USMC;  CWO Bruce Wincentsen, USMC; G.  Sgt. Edwin Martin, USMC; S. Sgt.  Philip Stover, USMC. Of course there  were many other dedicated soldiers,  marines, and loyal, hard working civil ians at Colt Industries that made this  program a success. These individuals  demonstrated selfless devotion to a Job  that was paramount to safeguarding  our Nation's defense by developing the  finest combat rifle for our soldiers and  marines.e  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 25, 1985  e ",1985
202,600,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  this month we celebrated the 67th An niversary of the Declaration of Esto nian Independence. It is vitally impor tant that we pause and think about  the  significance  of  commemorating  this day. The loss of any country to to talitarianism is a tragic experience and  one which all free men should know  and never forget. Only by remember ing can we profit from the mistakes of  the past and promise never to repeat  them.  As all of you know, Estonia, Lithua nia, and Latvia were once free and in dependent nations. In 1922, the United  States recognized those republics and  welcomed them into the international  arena. The Baltic Republics were  viable nations made up of industrious  and  independent farmers who cher ished their freedom.  In 1940,  the Soviet Army marched  into the Baltic States, and effectively  sealed  those small nations off from  the prying eyes of Western media.  They immediately formed puppet re gimes. The  legislatures,  completely  dominated by members of the Commu nist Party, petitioned  the Supreme  Soviet of the U .S.S.R to incorporate  each Baltic Republic into the Soviet  Union.  As soon as the Soviet troops arrived,  and  the  incorporation was declared,  the  troops began a  systematic cam paign of violence against the popula tion of these nations. They needed to  totally eliminate any opposition to the  new order. Over 665,000 Estonians,  Lithuanians, and Latvians were de ported to Siberia. Thousands died in  Soviet  concentration  camps.  The  Kremlin  settled  large  numbers  of  people of Russian stock in Estonia and  in other Baltic States to strengthen  their control of the area. Widespread  bloodshed  ensued when  the Baltic  guerrillas took to the forest to estab lish a network of armed opposition to  the illegal occupiers. More people were  killed when  the  front changed and  Nazi Germany  invaded her old ally,  the Soviet Union.  When  the  Soviets  returned  the  second time in 1944, they were deter mined to stay and began a brutal plan  of  collectivizing  the  countryside.  Farmers were forcibly evicted and de ported. Thousands managed to flee to  the West that year. More troops than  ever were brought in to destroy the  guerrilla movement. Even so, the par tisans continued  their struggle until  the early 1950's when, islolated by nu merous divisions, many in the resist ance movement gave up their arms.  In spite of overwhelming oppression,  the peoples of the Baltic States are  still struggling to maintain their lin guistic, ethnic, and religious identities.  We cannot abandon  these  freedom loving peoples. The Estonians,  and  other ethnic groups along the eastern  coast of the Baltic Sea, have already  demonstrated their determination for  liberty and  their willingness  to do  what is necessary to keep their nation al characters intact.  We must continue  to  remind  the  world that there once were free and  independent Baltic States, and should   work together to bring about an end to  the illegal occupation of Estonia and  other states in the region.  On  this anniversary,  I am certain  that my colleagues  in  the Congress  will join me in saying that those who  forget history are doomed to repeat it.  MEMORANDUM  ""Never in the course of centuries have the  Estonian people lost their ardent desire for  independence. From generation to genera tion, Estonians have kept  alive  the ...  hope that in spite of enslavement and op pression by other nations,  the  time will  come in Estonia ... when Kalev will come  home to bring his children happiness.""  With such timeless conviction begins Esto nia's Declaration  of  Independence,  pro claiming Estonia a free democratic republic  on February 24, 1918. On that day, Kalevi poeg,  the hero of  the Estonian national  epic, did come home  to bring his people  freedom  and  happiness. An  unwavering  desire for self-determination and freedom  from foreign oppression gave the Estonian  people the strength to fight for independ ence simultaneously against two invaders Bolshevik Russia and the German Landes wehr. Estonian  soldiers  overcame  these  overwhelming obstacles and defeated both  enemies.  During the brief period of political inde pendence,  Estonians  enjoyed  cultural  progress, agricultural and economic develop ment. In 1925 the young republic, appreciat ing  the  importance  of  ethnic  identity,  became the first country in the world to  grant  its minorities-Russians, Jews, Ger mans  and  Latvians-cultural  autonomy  through  government  subsidized  ethnic  schools, theaters and libraries.  World War II, however, brought alternate  Soviet and Nazi invasions ending in the forc ible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet  Union, an illegal takeover not recognized by  the United States to this day. Brutal depor tations took over one tenth of the popula tion  into Russian slave labor camps, while  scores of others lost their lives fighting the  enemy. In defiance of enormous obstacles,  tens of thousands managed to flee to free dom in the West in 1944. Now scattered all  over the world, Estonians derive knowledge  of experience from the past: they are deter mined not to allow their heritage to fade  away.  However, this month, the 67th anniversa ry of the Republic of Estonia's Declaration  of Independence finds its people in the West  and in Soviet-occupied Estonia gravely con cerned about their future. In Estonia, a sys tematic Soviet policy of russification and  national genocide is being carried out. The  percentage of Estonians in the population is  being reduced drastically by forced reloca",1985
203,613,3,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, it is with great pride that I com memorate the 67th anniversary of Es tonian Independence Day. The Esto nian people in the Soviet Union have  demonstrated  great  courage  and  strength as  they attempt  to  regain  their freedom as we in the free world  know it.  On February 24, 1985, we marked  the proclamation of independence for  the Republic of Estonia. The Esto nians enjoyed cultural progress, agri cultural  and  economic  development  until 1940, when their freedom and inEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dependence came to an end as they  were forcibly annexed by the Soviet  Union. On  a  day-to-day  basis  the  number of Estonians is being reduced  drastically by forced relocation, coloni zation by Russian and other  immi grants, and  increases  in  troops sta tioned in Estonia. The Estonians con tinue  to experience  threats  to  their  culture  and  language.  The  Soviet  Union has tried to rid them of their  strong sense of heritage by eliminating  their language and ethnic  traditions  and establishing Russian as the offi cial language in government employ ment and in schools. Such acts demon strate the Soviet attempt to ""Russian ize"" these people out of existence.  As a member of a  free nation, we  must continue  to speak out against  such aggression by the Soviet Union.  We must continue to seek the enforce ment of the Helsinki accords and im press upon the Soviet Union our objec tion to the denial of these individuals'  basic human rights.  Mr. Speaker, I am very moved by the  strength and conviction of these brave  people. I am thankful for this oppor tunity to pay tribute to these coura geous people of Estonia whose pro found courage and overwhelming com mitment to freedom and human rights  is an inspiration to us all.e  USIA: TAKING THE INITIATIVE  IN GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS  HON.

ZAMYATIN:  In recent months  Soviet media have levied a number of at tacks on U.S. public diplomacy and the U.S.  3487  Information Agency, especially on the Voice  of America and our new Worldnet satellite  television service. Your article in Literatur naya Gazeta [""Impasses of Confrontations  and Horizons of Cooperation,"" November  28, 19841 summarizes most of the charges  and typifies the underlying mindset. I am  prompted to respond at this time to the con tinuing  stream of  attacks because  in  a  period when our two governments are en gaged in serious exploration of vital issues,  such attacks are a disservice to more posi tive relations.  My hope is to generate a constructive dia logue. To initiate that dialogue I extend two  concrete offers. First, I ask that you offer  your good offices to facilitate using broad cast media to further mutual understand ing. In this regard, I suggest that you ar range for Soviet television to carry an ad dress by one of our top leaders which would  be reciprocated on American television by  one of your top leaders. There is a prece dent for this: Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Nixon  made such speeches several years ago with  considerable positive effect.  Second, I propose that we carry further  the dialogue by having you and other Soviet  officials and  journalists  take part in  the  Worldnet program of which you are so criti cal. Let us jointly plan a oneto two-hour  satellite television dialogue on Worldnet in  which Soviet  journalists  interview senior  U.S. officials on issues of mutual concern.  At the same time, you should plan with U.S.  media a similar program in which American  journalists freely and spontaneously ques tion senior Soviet officials. Coming at this  important time in our relations, such ven tures could help make communication more  reasoned and reciprocal.  Incidentally, I am not surprised by your  unwarranted criticisms of Worldnet and of  our Agency. I have come to expect it. How ever, you should understand that our coun try does not claim, as you do, that opposing  ideas ""subvert"" our system. We recognize in stead that diversity of public opinion is one  of the great strengths of America. Thus, our  society freely permits Soviet spokesmen to  state their views on American television and  in print. In this regard, I might note that  Soviet  journalists and Soviet officials are  interviewed on American television literally  dozens of times per year. Surely the time  has come for greater equality of treatment.  If the United States can confidently toler ate opposing views without fears of ""loosen ing"" the system, why then should the Soviet  government act so restrictively, even to the  point of jamming our broadcasts in direct  violation  of  several  international  agree ments to which the USSR is a signatory?  Why not allow greater independent public  inquiry about your government's decisions  and policies? Why should American offi cials, in turn, not be permitted to state their  views on Soviet television and in the Soviet  media? Our society has never walked away  from a fair challenge, and we look forward  to engaging in a peaceful contest of ideas  with the USSR.  Your article is evidence of the need for  this reasoned and open dialogue. Charges of  ""piracy of the air."" ""radio warfare,"" ""sub versive purpose,"" and ""television propagan da aggression"" only exacerbate  the ""im passes"" and ""confrontations"" to which you  allude and delay our search for ""horizons of  cooperation."" Coming at this time, when the  leaders of our two countries are seeking new  means for considering meaningful arms re duction efforts and ways to stabilize rela tions, your attacks are most unfortunate.  Surely,  everyone  concerned  about U.S.",1985

208,639,3,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, it  is wonderful that we are able to come  together today and continue the U.S.  commitment to helping the drought stricken countries of Africa. It is a  tribute to this Congress that we have  made this a priority early in the ses sion.  I hope we can continue  to make  Africa a priority because no matter  how much  food aid we  send  today,  without a commitment  to  long-term  strategies, Africans will still be starv ing next year. Without seed and well drilling equipment,  there will be no  grain and vegetables next year. During  the budget process, I urge each of you  to remember that seeds and tools sent  today mean fewer bags of grain that  we""ll need to send next year.  In July, the U.N. Decade for Women  World Conference will  take place in  Nairobi, Kenya. Its outcome may be  the key to any long-term solution to  drought and famine. It will provide a  forum  for women  in developing na tions to tell us what we can do to help  them solve their own problems. They  don't want or need us  to do  it for  them, but they do know that we can  off er valuable assistance and tools if  we will only hear what  they need.  Women perform nearly two-thirds of  the world's work hours. Let's listen to  them as we  consider  the  long-term  strategies we must consider to contin ue the commitment we are showing  here today.  By listening to women in developing  countries, we will be tapping new re sources in Africa, resources that will  enrich it.  ",1985
209,639,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York CMr. SOLOMON], a member  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  ",1985
210,639,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, at this  point in the debate, I would  like to  take a moment to put things into their  proper perspective.  The ongoing commitment by our  Government, and by our people as  well, to helping Africa in its need for  food and agricultural stability is truly  remarkable and is a vivid reminder of  America's  role  as  the  preeminent  champion of peace in the world.  I get more than a little upset when I  hear suggestions made in some of our  debates around here that the United  States is  the arms merchant of the  world and that, somehow, the interest  and desire for peace that has motivat ed our country's foreign policies over  the years is open to question.  It is sometimes said that the United  States pays  insufficient attention  to  Africa and the problems there. But let  us look at the record. In fiscal year  1983, we provided about 750,000 metric  tons of  food  to sub-Saharan Africa  through emergency humanitarian do nations and our regular food assist ance programs under Public Law 480.  In fiscal year 1984, we provided about  1.1 million metric tons of food to sub Saharan Africa. And now,  in  fiscal  1985, the projections point to a total  American contribution of 2.5 million  metre  tons of  food  toward meeting  sub-Saharan Africa's needs.  Now  let's contrast our record with  that of the Soviet Union. Over the last  2 years, the Soviet bloc has provided  less than 20,000 metric tons of food to  all of sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover,  the Soviet bloc has entered  into a  series of treaty arrangements with cer tain African countries that have had  the net result of allowing the Soviets  to plunder African fishing waters.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in  the RECORD an article that appeared in  the February 7, 1985, edition of News day, which  reports  the astonishing  fact that in 1983 alone the Soviet bloc  caught nearly 1 million metric tons of  fish  in waters off the west coast of  Africa. Entitled ""Soviets Take Food  Off Africa's Table,"" the article goes on  to describe  the efforts our Govern ment  is making  in helping African  countries  regain  control over  their  own fisheries. The text of the article is  as follows:  Sovn:rs TAKE Foon OFF .AnucA's TABLE  (By Daniel S. Mariaschin>  The waters off West Africa contain some  of  the world's  richest  fishing  grounds:  Ample harvests of sardines, herring, hake,  squid and shrimp are recorded annually. On  a  continent  that  is  ravaged by periodic  famine, fish  is a vital food source. In the  West African region, consumption of fish  provides upwards of 50 percent of daily pro tein requirements.  There are a few indigenous fishing fleets  in the area, notably those from Morocco,  the Ivory Coast and Senegal, but most West  African fishing is artisanal-done by individ ual fishermen utilizing small  launches or  canoes relatively close to shore. The major  catches are going  to  foreign  fleets, with  their sophisticated  trawlers and  research  vessels able to find the stocks and capable in  many instances of processing the fish on  board. Since most countries now claim ex clusive rights to waters as far as 200 miles  from shore, foreign nations have concluded  fishing agreements with host countries who  invariably receive  little  in return for  the  rights to their valuable resource.  The USSR and the eastern bloc nations  have been among the principal abusers of  fishing  privileges. According  to  recently  published statistics,  the foreign catch off  West Africa has amounted to nearly 60 per cent of the total harvest. The acknowledged  catch of the Soviets and their client states  for 1983 <the unreported  figures are be lieved by western  fisheries experts  to be  much higher> amounted to nearly one mil lion metric tons. A number of other foreign  fleets, the largest of which are from Japan,  Spain and South Korea, also engage in fish ing off West Africa.  In exchange for the right to fish  these  waters,  the Soviets have entered  into a  number of bilateral agreements over  the  past decade with a group of West African  countries including Angola, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Mauritania  and Sierra  Leone. On the surface of the agreement,  which vary somewhat from country to coun try, look like a good deal for the host na tions: the sharing of stock assessments and  other data, the establishment of fisheries  management and maritime training schools  as well as a portion of the catch, sometimes  amounting to 10 percent to 12 percent of  the total.  A closer look reveals these fisheries pacts  are decidedly in the USSR's favor. Moscow  has not developed an interest in the West  African coastal region only for its value as a  food source. It has been able to obtain port  and anchorage rights, supply arrangements,  the right to fly in fresh crews and the per manent stationing of ""fishing ministry rep resentatives"" in host ports. Along with the  well-known intelligence gathering activities  of the Russian trawlers, each of these bene fits gives the USSR a potential military ad vantage in the strategic central-eastern At lantic region. Though the basic purpose of  the Soviet fleet is to fish, that would not  preclude  its  taking on additional assign ments, including the testing of currents and  gathering  data  for Russian  submarines  plying the Atlantic.  U.S. experts in marine fisheries and Afri can affairs believe some West African gov ernments are beginning to realize their ar rangements with Moscow  are a one-way  affair. In some cases, promises to construct  processing and research facilities have not  been kept. In Mauritania, the research facil ity was built but part of it is off limits to all  but Soviet personnel.  A  fuller  appreciation of  the  fisheries'  value has led some West African officials to  look more closely at foreign fleets, particu larly  the USSR's with  its  factory ships.  There is serious concern that overfishing  will lead to an irreversible alteration of the  biological balance in West African waters.  Even artisanal fishermen are beginning to  voice complaints about the Soviet and east ern bloc catch, which has begun to have an  impact on local economies.  In  response  to  growing  dissatisfaction  with the USSR and what is seen as its in creasing exploitation of one of West Africa's  few abundant natural resources, several fed eral department and agencies including the  Pentagon, Department of State, the Agency  for International Development, the Nation al Marine Fisheries Service, and the Coast  Guard, are proposing two programs to assist  host countries in managing and protecting  their maritime fisheries.  The Pentagon's West African Coastal Sur veillance Initiative would provide U.S. Coast  Guard training to West African navies and  coastal patrols. The objective is to improve  their capability to monitor the fishing ac tivities of foreign fleets in their economic  zones.  While rights to on-board inspection and  surveillance are claimed by all West African  countries, in practice this activity is spotty  and ineffective. Coast Guard training in sur veillance methods and in halting violations  can help re-establish an equilibrium in host  nation-foreign fleet relations.  A companion initiative, to improve West  African fisheries management and develop ment, will be undertaken by AID. A pro gram of high-level seminars and  training  sessions  in such areas as data collection,  stock assessments and monitoring, and the  establishment of effective policies and regu",1985
211,652,3,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of H.R. 607, the Cost Sav ings Disclosure Awards Extension Act.  This important measure would contin ue  the policy of  rewarding Govern ment employees who expose fraud and  waste.  These whistleblowers,  some times harassed by their superiors be cause of their often embarrassing dis closures,  deserve  our  full  support.  They are the often unsung heros in  the war for greater Government effi ciency.  First instituted in 1979, the policy of  providing small monetary incentives to  encourage  cost-saving  disclosures  lapsed at the end of 1984. But it has  already proven its worth. The inspec tors general of the Veterans' Adminis tration, the Interior Department, and  the Labor Department have provided  $6,100 in awards to employees whose  disclosures have  saved  the Govern ment-and thus the taxpayer-nearly  $1 million.  The  inspectors  general  of  these  agencies, as well as that of the De fense Department, have responded fa vorably to this policy and have sup ported its extension as a valuable cost saving tool.  A great deal of rhetoric is heard in  this Chamber and across the country  about cutting the fat out of the Feder al bureaucracy. Here is one piece of  legislation that can give some concrete  meaning to that tough talk. I, for one,  wholeheartedly support it.e  e ",1985
212,652,3,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in strong support of H.R. 607, the  Cost-Savings Disclosure Awards Ex tension Act. This important measure  would once again grant authority to  agencies to present awards to Federal  employees who disclose waste, fraud,  or mismanagement  in  the Govern ment. Since this power expired in Sep tember of last year, the Government  has been unable to give cash bonuses  to  those  diligent  Federal workers  whose sharp eyes have helped reduce  the national deficit.  I commend Representative SCHROE DER  for  reintroducing  this bill. The  Cost-Savings Disclosure Program, by  all accounts, is a cost-effective Federal  initiative. According to the House Post  Office and Civil Service Subcommittee  on Civil  Service,  through October  1984, seven Federal employees had re ceived awards totaling $6,100 for dis closures that have saved over $960,000.  That's a rate of return of which we  can all be proud.  This  legislation should be quickly  passed by  the Congress, and signed  into law. All Federal agencies should  strive to make greater use of the pro gram. But it is important to note that  the bill before us today extends the  disclosure awards to members of our  armed services-an extremely  timely  move, given the concern we all have  for extracting greater efficiency from  our defense spending.  Mr. Speaker, in this time of soaring  Federal deficits, it is essential that we  get maximum value for every dollar  we spend. This legislation will help us  achieve  that critical goal.  I strongly  urge my colleagues  to support  this  vital measure.e  ",1985

221,665,3,Mr. BUSTAMANTE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Montana  for yielding.  Speaker,  not  2  years  have  elapsed since the National Commission  on Excellence in Education issued its  report: ""A Nation at Risk."" The report  was  the object of much fanfare by  President Reagan as a demonstration  of  his  commitment  to  improving  America's classrooms and student per formance. Former Secretary of Educa tion Bell made public appearances,  heralding the President's dedication to  academic  excellence.  The  report  spawned much-needed reforms in edu cational  standards.  The  President  rightfully  brought  this  important  issue to public awareness; but, the ad ministration's pomp and circumstance  over education has become noticeably  muffled. The report now collects dust  on a shelf; its contents forgotten by  the individual who commissioned it.    Since publication of ""A Nation at  Risk,"" our country's educational sys tems have been working more closely  than ever to improve academic stand ards. Implementation of these reforms  will be a futile gesture if the Congress  approves the budget cuts for education  proposed by President Reagan.  If we cut back Government's role in  assisting students to afford the costs  of higher learning-if we reduce pro gram funding for language-minority  students-if we shrink State grants for  migrant education-do we not impede  America's ability to meet our leader ship challenges? We have sacrificed  enough by freezing most programs for  elementary, secondary, and vocational  education. To carry forward  the ad ministration's proposals will  reverse  the progress of education and subse quently the progress of this Nation.  Government's role in education has  been: First, to maintain excellence in  scholastic standards; and second,  to  educate all who desire an education  and are able to pursue it. Proposed ad ministration cuts  renege on our re sponsibilities in meeting these objec tives. Costs of higher education con tinue to escalate. They require finan",1985

223,678,3,Mr. WEBER.," I thank the gentleman  from New York for yielding, and I just  want to rise for a very brief moment to  commend  the gentleman  for  taking  this special order to discuss this very  important issue, and especially to com mend  the gentleman because, as he  pointed out, he comes from an area of  the country where  there has been  some political support for the concept  of a nuclear-free zone.  I know what  that is like; my State of Minnesota is  another  such  area  of  the  country  where we have political movements  that are always generating opposition  to our strategic policies where the con cept of a nuclear-free zone has gained  some currency. I doubly commend the  gentleman because I know it is a posi tion that is difficult to def end in his  region of the country as it is in mine.  The only point I would add to that is  that I really think the important point  the gentleman made, the most impor tant point, and the point that I hope is  understood in New Zealand is that we  are  fully  justified, and  in my  judg ment, obliged, to make some kind of a  strong reaction in this country. The  argument that we should soft-peddle  this  issue  for fear of off ending  the  New Zealanders in my judgment is ba sically false. The people in New Zea land need to understand why.  The reason is fundamental and ele mental. That is because ultimately the  strength of the defense of the free  world  is far more dependent on our  ability  to hold the alliance  together  than it is on anything that goes on in  the Eastern bloc. We have managed to  respond  fairly  successfully  to  the  threat  from  the Eastern bloc  ever  since  the end of World War II. We  have shown our capacity  to defend  freedom against the Soviet bloc. What  we are unaware of and unsure of is  how we would fare if the unraveling  process  began  that  the  gentleman  from New York referred to. That is  why it is important for the people of  New Zealand  to understand that al though we respect their integrity and  their sovereignty and  their national  pride, this is a threat to the entire de fense of the Western World and a very  strong reaction from our country  is  not only  justified but obliged in my  judgment.

224,678,3,Mr. MOLINARI.," I thank the gentle man for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle man  from  American  Samoa  [Mr.  SUNIA].  ",1985
225,678,3,Mr. SUNIA.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding to me and I commend the  gentleman  for  this special order so  that we might address this very impor tant subject.  Mr. Speaker, in my mind, New Zea land has behaved very badly. There is  no question but that it has failed to  live up  to  its commitments for  the  joint defense of the area. To set condi tions for  receiving  into  its port our  naval vessels is most irresponsible. The  spirit of ANZUS was to jointly share  the burdens of common defense.  Should not New Zealanders be glad  that the taxpayers of this country are  paying for their defense? While they  spend  their  tax dollars perfecting a  cradle-to-grave welfare society, we in  the United States are having to give  up a lot of living essentials so that we  can pay for defense-ours as well as  New Zealand's.  Our State Department is quite cor rect in its attitude. We are not inter fering with New Zealand's  internal  politics. Our concern  is  its policies  toward its friends and allies.  For American Samoa, our lone terri tory in the middle of the South Pacif ic, closer to New Zealand than to the  United States, the New Zealand refus al is of real concern. Of course, our  own Pago Pago Harbor is opened to  our own ships at any and all  times,  and Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Ale sana of Western Samoa has kindly of fered the facilities of Apia Harbor to  our U.S. Navy. We appreciate all that,  but it does not solve the problem.  The problem now is that there now  exists a question: Is New Zealand truly  and honestly serious about defense?  Do the antinuclear and pacifist groups  in New Zealand seriously believe that  the Soviets will leave them out of an  all-out nuclear conflict  in honor of  their antinuclear beliefs? Is New Zea land, reputed to be more British than  the Britishers,  and more  educated  than most Pacific  residents,  really  that far away from  the rest of the  world  that  realities  have  escaped  them?  In a real conflict, can one count on  defense partners  like New Zealand?  That to me is now the real question.  I am aware also of the concern at  the State Department about the effect  of this New Zealand rejection on our  other allies with whom we also have  defense arrangements. Supposing our  friends  in Europe pick up from  the  New Zealanders, we will really have a  mounmental problem.  And I do not put too much credit on  Prime Minister Lange's preferences of  continued friendship and cooperation.  He  cannot  come  to us with  clean  hands and blame certain factors in his  country. We have our own antinuclear  groups. They too are vocal and powerful. But that is all internal. We do not  go  around  the world  complaining  about them and blaming them for dic tating policies. Mr. Lange is the Prime  Minister and the show is entirely his.  Should we retaliate? I think not. We  regret the actions of our friends, but  lets not be retaliatory. It will serve no  useful purpose.  I am aware of how  easy it is to get up on this floor and  sermonize about merits of patience  and tolerance. Out there in the real  world, the forces at work may only re spect responses that are packed with  force and thinly veiled threats of eco nomic disasters.  But I still believe there is  time to  work on our friends. We dare not allow  them to dictate to us, but we should  not be without  the patience of  the  older and bigger partner.  Then there is also the rest of the  area  to consider. The New Zealand  problem may not be the lone problem  for Uncle Sam in the area. I suspect  others will begin to surface in the near  future. The blame belongs to us. Like  a yard you neglect, you soon find all  kinds of bad weeds growing with aban don. The Soviets now roam the south  seas at will and make the small Pacific  island nations all kinds of offers. The  Cubans  are  in Vanuaatu,  and  the  French problem  in New Caledonia  may broaden into a messy one for the  area-and there could be a spill over  into other parts of the Pacific.  My point is, Mr. Speaker, I believe  the time has come for us to seriously  review our Pacific situation.  In our  concerns for the peoples of Southeast  Asia, our trade with the Orient, and  the oil routes into the Pacific, we may  be overlooking little troubles brewing  in our own backyard.  We share  the Pacific Ocean with  New Zealand. We also share the Pacif ic with all the newly created island na tions. But we are still the big brother.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I do not believe  retaliation alone is the proper form of  response. I believe we should work a  little harder on our difficult friend.  After all we are working very hard  with our adversaries.  0 1640  ",1985

228,704,3,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, the most  popular  budget word  this  year  is  ""Freeze.""  As one of the original four cospon sors of the original budget freeze last  year, I should be pleased about that.  But everyone means something differ ent, and most of the proposals are not  really freezes at all.  Last year  four Senators, Senators  KASSEBAUM, GRASSLEY, BAUCUS, and I  offered what has since become known  as the KGB freeze. As we offered it  then-and as we off er it again  this  year-the KGB freeze  really freezes  every Federal program. Budget  au thority for national defense would be  the same in fiscal year 1986 as its was  in fiscal year 1985. Domestic discre tionary programs would be similarly  frozen. For 1 year, there would be no  cost-of-living increases from any Fed eral spending programs. Physician and  hospital fees would be frozen during  fiscal year 1986.  It is clear today, as it was last year,  that this is the most fair, most even handed approach to reducing deficits  that Congress could adopt. It could  also be adopted with  relative speed  since most of this year's other propos als start off from the KGB freeze as a  base. And it could freeze deficits for  long enough to permit us  to put in  place further efforts to reduce deficits.  I  am particularly  concerned, Mr.  President, that as various individuals  and  groups  seek  to  reinvent  the  wheel-that is  to develop  their own  version of a freeze-we are losing pre vious time and we are increasng con tention and discord.  Of all  the alternative freezes,  the  President's freeze plus is probably the  best known. But his freeze calls for  real growth in defense of nearly 6 per cent while at the same time freezing  or cutting many crucial programs such  as education, child nutrition, health,  and environment. His so-called freeze  has done much to increase the level of  contention and disagreement over how  to deal with this year's deficits.  Most recently, the executive commit tee of the National Governors' Confer ence has proposed what  it  terms a  budget freeze. But this program would  adjust defense spending for inflation  but would not do so for other discre tionary  spending  programs. And  it  would take away an inflation adjust ment  for Social Security  recipients  and others while allowing an inflation  adjustment  for  defense  spending.  While  I  admire  the Governors  for  coming up with a  deficit  reduction  program, I cannot support one which  deals so unevenly with Federal activi ties.  Mr. President, it is critical that we  get on with the business of deficit re duction. Last  year's highly  touted  ",1985

He told me of his  dismay when Japan's Vice Minister of  Posts and Telegraphs  told him they  wished  to  discuss  again  the  basic  theory and framework instead of spe cific issues-in direct contradiction of  the original schedule.  Secretary Baldrige  is  a  straight shooting and dedicated public servant;  he is not constrained by rigid ideology.  But he is also frustrated-frustrated  by the lack of straight talk by his Jap anese counterparts.  Mr. President, I have visited Japan  three  times.  I have met with  their  businessmen and their farmers. I have  met and talked with Government offi cials.  In my State of Montana, we care a  great deal about  the United States Japanese relationship; Mike Mansfield  provides a special emotional tie for us.  I have a great deal of respect for the  Japanese. And I have come to believe  that their respect for us depends on  our willingness  to be  tough, on our  willingness to see past polite words to  actions. It is only when the Japanese  negotiators  see we  are prepared  to  insist on results that talks will bear  fruit.  And so  I commend Secretary Bal drige's decision. He correctly sensed  that the Japanese Vice Minister's at tempt to delay the substantive talks  was the beginning of an old ploy: Pre vent any serious concessions by dis cussing  the  framework while  time  passes and the deadline approaches.  The Secretary wisely decided to stop  this game before it could begin.  Mr. President, we in Montana have a  special interest in the forest products  negotiations currently proceeding  in  Tokyo. I am glad they are going for ward, but I note  they have run up  against  the  Japanese  insistence on  protection.  It would, however, be a mistake for  anyone to think that I or my constitu ents care only about forest products.  I-and others in this body-are watch ing for progress in all areas under dis cussion.  The Japanese cannot have it both  ways. They cannot expect the United  States to permit Japanese companies  to certify  their products as meeting  our standards while Japan does not  permit U.S. companies to certify their  products meet Japanese standards.  When AT&T broke up,  Japanese  telecommunications  exports  to  the  United States jumped from $600 mil lion to $2 billion. We expect the right  to compete in their market as well, yet  they use licensing and other nontariff  barriers to keep our sales at $300 mil lion.  Mr.  President,  I'm sure my  col leagues  join me in supporting Secre tary Baldrige's decision. He is walking  a fine line: Making it clear we hope to  resume  real  talks,  but  refusing  to  engage in phony ones.  Although  this approach heightens  trade tensions, it seems to be the only  approach  that will  result  in signifi cantly increased sales for U.S. export ers.  THE  INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS  CONTROL  STRATEGY  REPORT  ",1985
230,730,3,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, on  February 14, 1985, the State Depart ment released a document which ad dresses a very important aspect of our  Nation's continued efforts  to stamp  out illegal narcotics. The ""Internation al Narcotics Control Strategy Report""  is,  in effect, a ""report card"" of illicit  drug eradication efforts worldwide.  The report is a major component of  the diplomacy against drugs amend ment, which would cut off U.S. aid to  foreign nations that do not take steps  to eliminate their illicit drug crops.  In this report, detailed information  is provided on the drug-production of  every major nation where drugs are  grown. The disturbing news that the  marijuana,  coca,  and opium poppy  crops were larger in 1984 than in the  year before is also revealed in this doc ument.  The United States currently has dip lomatic  relations with 10 of  the 13  major drug producing nations, and in  seven of those countries, drug crops in creased in the last year. All seven of  these nations receive U.S. aid.  That is why I introduced and gained  enactment of  the diplomacy-against drugs amendment. I realized we were  wasting  a  potentially  important  weapon in the war against drugs. The  diplomatic leverage supplied by calling  for a cut off of foreign to any nation  refusing to take steps to cut its illegal  narcotic  production  is  a  necessary  legal tool.  This is illustrated in the example of  Colombia. The report delineates that  efforts made by this brave nation, for merly the primary producer of both  marijuana and coca,  to eradicate  its  drug crops. As a result of Colombia's  self-declared ""War Without Quarter,""  their marijuana crop has been reduced  by one-third. Colombia continues  to  make inroads in reducing its narcotics  production, accompained by the sus tained aid and support of  the U.S.  Government.  An unfortunate fallout of the crack down of the Colombian Government  on drug production  is  the flight of  drug  traffickers  to other South and  Central American nations. As revealed  in this report, for example, Ecuador  was  discovered  to  have  become  a  major coca producing nation. This is a  great surprise, since in the last State  Department report of this kind Ecua dor was seen as having no ""significant  coca or cannabis cultivation."" The new  report  indicates  that  Ecuadorean  drug-enforcement officials have dis covered in the past year 2,500 to 7 ,500  acres  of  coca  bushes, making  this  nation the world's third largest pro ducer. Peru and Brazil are reported as  having also increased their coca and  marijuana production, and Bolivia is  condemned in the State Department  report  for not having eradicated a  ""single coca plant."" Despite large-scale  assistance from the United States, the  report describes Bolivia as a major dis appointment. Jamaica was also singled  out in this document as a nation not  making sufficient eradication efforts;  and Belize was newly classified as one  of the world's largest marijuana pro ducers.  In Asia,  promises made  to  the  United States by officials of the Thai  Government have begun to pay off,  and  the same situation  is  true  for  Pakistan. Though modest reductions  were, in fact, seen in both countries,  determination has been displayed by  Government authorities of both coun tries to achieve substantial results in  eradication efforts.  Mr. President, as we continue in our  efforts to achieve the eradication of  drug abuse in our Nation, we can see  that  the  diplomacy  against  drug  amendment  is something that could  break the vicious cycle of foreign drug  production, and domestic drug con sumption. The example of Bolivia can  attest  to  the  logic of  this. Between  1981 and 1983, Bolivia received $105.4  million in foreign aid from the United  States. During that same  time,  this  nation  inundated America with be tween 80 to 100 metric tons of cocaine.  This situation, unfortunately, has not  significantly changed. The results of  this report should be viewed by Bolivia  as a warning: Cut off your drug pro duction, or the United States will cut  off its aid. It is as simple as that, Mr.  President, and continued such imple mentation of  the diplomacy against  drugs amendment will guarantee  its  success. Mr. President,  I  ask unani mous consent that the attached article  from  the New York Times, entitled,  ""Drug Crops Are Up In Export Na tions,"" dated February 14, 1985, be in serted in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Feb. 15, 19851  DRUG CROPS ARE UP IN EXPORT NATIONS,  STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS  <By Joel Brinkley>  WASHINGTON.-The  State Department's  annual report on worldwide narcotics pro duction shows that in most of the major  ",1985
231,743,3,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join my distinguished col league,  the Senator  from Michigan,  and other colleagues  in  introducing  legislation  to extend Federal supple mental unemployment for 18 addition al months. While some claim that 1984  was a banner year for the economy,  hundreds of thousands of our neigh bors know only the continuing agony  of long-term unemployment. Accord ing  to  the Department  of Labor,  325,000 people, who  lost  their  jobs  through no fault of their own, receive  supplemental unemployment compen sation as their main source of income.  They will lose all unemployment bene fits when  that program, which has  kept their hopes alive, automatically  expires on March 31.  Mr. President,  this  legislation ad dresses urgent needs throughout our  Nation. Many unemployed persons re ceive benefits for only a short time  before finding another job, but many  live in regions where there has been  no recovery. Long-term unemployment  has been on the rise, up from 1,266,000  persons out of work  6 months or  longer in January, 1981, to 1,402,000 in  December  1984. During  that  same  period,  the average length of unemrose  by more  ployment nationwide  than 20 percent.  The ripple effects of unemployment  on  our National,  State,  and  local  economies are tremendous. Local busi ness is particularly hard hit, as unem ployed persons become unable to pur chase even  the most basic commod ities. The  assistance  these benefits  have provided are of critical  impor tance. I urge my colleagues to join me  in cosponsoring this urgently needed  measure.e  e ",1985
232,743,3,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I rise  to cosponsor  the  legislation offered  today by my colleague from Michigan.  This bill extends the Federal Supple mental Compensation [FSCl Program  which provides supplemental benefits  to long-term unemployed individuals.  Since the present program  is sched uled to expire on March 31, this bill  requires our immediate attention.  A critical need for the FSC Program  continues to exist. While economic re covery from depression-like conditions  has brought a heartening drop in the  official  unemployment  rate,  unem ployment remains a serious problem in  our country today. Nearly 8% million  people remain unable to find a job de spite  their search. Although Michi gan's economy has improved markedly  under  the  leadership  of Governor  Blanchard, the State's seasonally ad justed unemployment rate of 11 per cent remains unacceptably high. To  suggest that the need for a FSC Pro gram no longer exists is simply wrong.  I find it appalling that the administra tion seeks to cut off funding for this  program.  Many misperceptions about Federal  unemployment programs abound. One  I  sometimes hear  is  that unemploy ment claimants are freeloaders waiting  at home for a handout. I reject that  notion. That belief reflects an  igno rance of the unemployment insurance  system. It is an insurance system be cause  it provides  insurance  for eco nomic survival between periods of em ployment. These unemployed Ameri cans receiving benefits are people who  have  toiled  to provide products and  services  for  their  fell ow citizens.  In  order to be eligible for the benefits,  they have had  to work a  requisite  number of weeks during  their most  recent employment and must continue  to seek employment actively.  Some argue that providing benefits  to these individuals will not help them  in the long run. Unfortunately, it is  true that some of these long-term un employed  individuals  may  never  return  to  jobs for which  they were  trained. Training programs that teach  new skills are consequently very  im portant for many of  them. Thus,  I  cannot understand why  the budget  submitted  by  the President makes  severe cuts  in  title  III of  the Job  Training and Partnership Act, the pro",1985
233,782,3,Mr.  SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to an outstanding  religious leader and community activ ist, Rabbi Edgar Gluck whom I have  been privileged  to know  for over a  decade. Rabbi Gluck is one of those  extraordinary men who are blessed  with enormous energy and personal  commitment which enables  them  to  work tirelessly for the good of others.  Rabbi Gluck has served the people  of New York not only as a  religious  leader, but as an effective civil servant  who knows the intricacies of our local  and State government. But he is also  no stranger in Washington, where he  has come over the years to lobby and  to testify on the importance of com munity anticrime programs,  juvenile  justice services, and the need for im proved health and mental health serv ices. You are as  liable  to see Rabbi  Gluck in Albany, as at the city council,  or in the Halls of the Congress, for he  is  a  community  leader who under stands the importance of taking one's  message wherever the decisions affect ing a community are made.  Sometime ago Rabbi Gluck's enor mously creative mind dreamed up the  concept of the Hatzohol, a volunteer  rescue squad that would be equipped  with the most modern medical  techFebruary 26, 1985  nology and staffed with trained com munity people. As usual with Rabbi  Gluck, he was able to communicate his  concept and work with other commu nity leaders until this important auxil iary emergency health service became  a reality. Thanks to the trailblazing of  Rabbi Gluck and his associates, many  other Jewish communities have now  organized similar Hatzohol units.  Rabbi Gluck has also worked to im prove the health care services for the  Borough Park area by serving as a  member of the board of directors of  Maimonides Hospital's Mental Health  Board and chairman of  its Political  Action Committee. Because  of  his  many years of experience with public  safety issues, Rabbi Gluck now serves  as chairman of the Rabbinical Police  Liaison Committee of New York State.  In that role, Rabbi Gluck serves as an  important interpreter of the needs and  concerns of  the community  to our  State and local law enforcement offi cials.  Mr. Speaker, President Reagan has  constantly reminded us all of the im portant role that dedicated communi ty leaders like Rabbi Edgar Gluck play  in improving the quality of life of our  cities, towns, and neighborhoods. It is  a marvelous indication of the vitality  of American democracy that so many  of our  citizens  remain willing  and  eager to work for the good of their  communities.  May the good example of men like  Rabbi Gluck inspire our youth to con tinue this important tradition of vol unteer service. For, without the dedi cation and philanthropic commitment  of people like Rabbi Gluck, our com munities would be far less hospitable  places  in which  to  live and raise a  family .   THE KRASNOYARSK RADAR  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1985  e ",1985
234,782,3,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, dis cussion of future arms control agree ments with the Soviet Union naturally  includes  the matter  of  compliance  with past agreements. Recently  the  President has made public a  list of  seven  Soviet  violations  of  existing  arms  control  agreements which he  deems certain, and the General Advi sory Committee report finds nine posi tive  violations. Both  surveys  detail  many other violations of less certain ty. The most notable violation, and  some of its political implications, was  reviewed by  the Washington Post's  editors in an editorial of February 5,  1985, which I commend to the atten tion of my colleagues:  The editorial follows:  ",1985
235,795,3,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  take this opportunity to commemorate  the 67th anniversary of the independ ence of Estonia. On February 24, 1918,  the hopes and desires of the Estonian  people were realized with a declaration  of independence proclaiming Estonia a  free democratic republic.  For  the next  two decades, peace,  prosperity, and freedom flourished in  this Baltic State. The Estonian people  demonstrated what  a  small nation  could achieve under a democratic way  of life.  World War II, however, ushered in a  brutal era of repression and tyranny.  Stalin  forcibly  incorporated Estonia  into the Soviet Union and embarked  on an intensive campaign of Russifica tion. While  I  am  proud  that  the  United States has not recognized the  Soviet takeover, I am saddened by the  fact  that Moscow's efforts  to com pletely suppress the Estonian culture  continue.  The Kremlin  is  increasingly elilni nating  the Estonian  language  and  ethnic traditions. Estonian mores and  values are being eroded. Many places  of worship have been closed. Religious  and political activity  is  tightly con trolled and any person who expresses  a view not sanctioned by the govern ment is dealt with harshly. A signifi cant number of religious believers and  peaceful dissidents continue to be im prisoned, harassed, physically and psy chologically  abused,  and  subject  to  other forms of inhumanity, for coura geously bringing Soviet violations  to  the attention of the world.  Nevertheless,  even while  enduring  these insufferable injustices, the Esto nian people have not lost their deter mination  to  recover  their  freedom.  They are a brave and valiant people  who are destined to enjoy, once again,  democratic government.  As chairman of  the Subcommittee  on Human Rights and International  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Organizations, I have a deep interest  in the plight of the Estonian people.  The subcommittee will closely monitor  Soviet abuses of its citizens and work  to help those everywhere who are vic timized by  totalitarianism. As a  free  nation, we must continue to support  the Estonian people in their struggle  to remove the chains of oppression.   A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM  HOLSCLAW  HON. HARRY M. REID  OF NEVADA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1985   ",1985
236,795,3,Mr. REID.," Mr. Speaker, it was on  February 10, 1984, when events, un planned and unexpected, changed Wil liam Holsclaw's life-when the hopes  and dreams of a normal 12-year-old  boy were superseded by the struggle to  save lives-those of his two younger  brothers and himself.  During the early morning hours on  that February day, William awoke in  his family's trailer,  located  in Jean,  NV. Smoke and fire had engulfed the  mobile home. After running through a  flame-filled  hallway  to  awaken  his  father, William returned to his bed room to locate his two brothers, Brian,  then 4, and Jimmy, then 3. Because  William's father could not reach his  sons through the flames, William him self found his brothers and handed  them out the window  to his father.  First, he gave Brian to his father and  then returned to the flaming area to  locate Jimmy, who was wedged be tween the bed and the wall. After free ing his youngest brother  from  the  burning trailer, William with his hair  and back burning, climbed  through  the window to safety.  All  three youngsters were  treated  for burns. The two youngest had only  minor injuries. For William, however,  secondand  third-degree  burns  scorched more than 50 percent of his  body and, even now, he must wear a  pressurized body suit  to protect his  slowly healing skin.  Within days of the incident I was  fortunate enough to have the opportu nity to praise William for his bravery.  I would have given a more detailed  tribute, but, because of the rules of  the House, I was limited to 1 minute.  Following is that speech.  He smiles sheepishly when responding-""!  just did what came natural."" Yet, to most,  the story of William Holsclaw's courage far  surpasses ""Normal.""  Earlier  this month, 12-year-old William  bravely ignored flames that were engulfing  his family's mobile home, to rescue his two  younger brothers, 4-year-old Brian and 3year-old Jimmy-one at a time.  ""He stood there and handed those babies  out while he was cooking"" his father repeats  to  the sympathetic  listener. Thinking of  himself first was not William's way when  those flames threatened his family.  3669  By the time his father pulled William out  of  the burning  inferno, William had suf fered burns over nearly 50 percent of his  body. And, William's bravery must continue,  as he faces the many needed skin grafts to  repair his charred body.  I am humbled when I hear such stories of  courage and especially touched about Wil liam, who lives in Jean, NV, a small, isolated  town more than an hour's drive from any  rescue assistance.  I am proud to praise William's unselfish  courage and his sense of humanity-quali ties that, for William, just came natural.  Shortly after delivering this message  to Congress,  I  submitted William's  name to the Carnegie Hero Fund Com mission for nomination. In December,  the commission awarded William the  hero's medal.  It was a great pleasure for me  to  present that medal to William in Feb ruary-just 1 year after his heroic act.  His selflessness and courage have set  an example  for  the rest of us and  helped us realize the value of life.  William is one of the few people rec ognized  annually  by  the Carnegie  Hero Fund Commission. Since 1904,  the commission has honored people  who risk or lose their lives in saving or  attempting to save the life of someone  else. William, who was one of nearly  1,000 nominees for a Carnegie Medal  in 1984, was one of the three youngest  to receive the award.  Though the details of the incident  will fade from the memories of others,  the significance of his heroism will live  on for William and his family. Yes, he  has medals, but he also has  scars.  More important than awards, howev er, and a greater  tranquilizer  than  medicine-are  the  smiling  faces  of  Brian and  Jimmy-two young boys  who will always consider their older  brother the greatest hero in history.e  THE 67TH ANNIVERSARY OF  ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1985  ",1985
237,795,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am pleased to join in commemorating  the 67th anniversary of Estonian inde pendence. Amidst the Russian Revolu tion  and World War  I,  this  small  nation declared  its  independence on  February 24.  In 1920, after valiantly  struggling for independence during in vasions  from  the Red Army,  the  nation  of Estonia  finally  signed  a  peace treaty with the Soviet Union.  During this period of true sovereign ty, this tiny republic proved the im portance of self-determination and in  insuring the principles of justice and  liberty.

238,808,3,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, today I,  and many of my colleagues are consid ering the issue of funding for educa tion. Today,  the full Education and  Labor Committee  commenced  hear ings on the proposed cuts in education.  The  President's budget  includes  a  number of policy changes which are  not necessarily obvious. For example,  on  the  issue of  funding  for  library  services and construction,  the Presi dent has again zeroed out all funds.  His press  releases which summarize  the cuts portray this as a $32 million  cut, but it is really a $125 million cut.  This is clear in the detailed appendix  to  the budget  even  if  it does not  appear in the more commonly scanned  press releases and summaries.  Libraries will  also  suffer  further  budget cuts if the President has his  way. The decrease in the postal reve nue  foregone means,  quite  simply,  that many  libraries will  find  them selves paying increased fees for fourth  class mailing. This double blow has  not escaped the notice of those of us  who  care about  libraries and  their  vital role in the original and continu ing education of our people.  The budget also cuts expenditures in  the  special  education  services  from  $1,321,270  in  fiscal  year  1985  to  $1,306,100  in  fiscal  year 1986. Now  that does not seem to be too much of a  cut, but when you put it together with  the elimination of free mailing for the  blind and the physically handicapped,  it means a great deal less assistance  for those who are clearly in need.  The President has  also  proposed  severe cuts  in postsecondary educa tion. In Federal fiscal year 1984, New  York State guaranteed 393,528 student  loans for a total of $936 million. This  represented 12.5 percent of all dollars  provided nationally through the Guar anteed Student Loan Program.  Based on 1983-84 borrowing, the ad ministration's proposal  to  limit GSL  eligibility to students in families with  incomes of $32,500 or less would elimi nate  95,880  loans-24  percent-and  would  reduce  the  total borrowed by  $221.81 million-24  percent. Under graduate borrowing would be cut by 24  percent and graduate borrowing by 22  percent.  An additional 27,000 graduate stu dents with incomes below $32,500 will  have  their guaranteed student  loans  reduced as a result of the proposal for  a $4,000 cap on total Federal aid from  all programs. Most graduate student  borrowers now  take  loans of more  than $4,000 per year. The estimated  loss from  this proposal will be $34.0  million. The combined proposals will  February 26, 1985  eliminate or  reduce guaranteed stu dent loans for 75 percent of graduate  student borrowers.  Secretary Bennett has  repeatedly  spoken up for the President's budget.  He says that no student will be de prived of an education because parents  can borrow an additional $4,000 per  year  in PL US  loans. The Secretary  does not explain how poor parents will  commence  payment  and meet  the  PLUS installments. This deficit gener ating administration apparently feels  that one way to reduce Federal defi cits is to shift them unto those who  seek an education.  In conclusion,  it is  important that  we all consider just what the adminis tration  proposes.  Cuts  are  spread  across every human service program  while programs related to defense or  the destruction of others are lavishly  funded. This bespeaks a  rather dim  view of the future that I cannot share.  The real and practical peace and pros perity of future America  is best se cured by a greater and more generous  national committment to education.   A CONGRESSIONAL SALUTE TO  THE  MEXICAN-AMERICAN  DEMOCRATIC CLUB ON THEIR  25TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. GLENN M. ANDERSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1985  e ",1985
239,808,3,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  proud to call the attention of my col leagues to the 25th anniversary of the  Mexican-American Democratic Club.  This year's installation banquet was  held in Harbor City on Saturday, Feb ruary 9, and you can be sure that a  great time was had by all.  The club was founded in 1958 and  chartered 2 years later under the guid ance of Manuel Betancourt, Henry  Flores, and Victor Valdez. It was estab lished to help Hispanics become more  actively  involved  in  the community  and, of course, the machinery of the  Democratic Party. Today, the club is  open to anyone who has the vision to  make America a better place to live.  Those who  join  know  that  the  Democratic Party  is  the  hope  for  simple justice of equality, fairness and  compassion  toward  all  our  people.  They stand for basic civil and human  rights and the hope for all Americans  to earn a decent living and a chance to  get ahead. They want to make sure  that the wealthy and powerful live up  to  their  responsibilities  to a  society  that is fair, prosperous and strong. I  suppose the ideals of those who join  and  support  the Mexican-American  Democratic Club can best be summed  up by a 1940 quote  from President  Franklin Roosevelt:  ",1985

255,847,3,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, let me say  at the outset that I hope we can dis pose of the pending bill and all amendments this afternoon. I am not certain  we can do that, but we are going to  try. What I would like to do now is to  have a short discussion of the merits  of the pending amendment and then  dispose of it. I, for one, would like to  make a brief statement. I think there  are others who would like to make a  brief statement. There has been a lot  of general discussion, but we have not  really  focused on what  the amend ment might do. I will just take a few  minutes to state my understanding of  the Zorinsky amendment as amended  by  the distinguished Senator  from  Montana.  There are a number of provisions.  One would be an improvement in the  processing of applications by Farmers  Home. But another requires the Secre tary to use up to $100 million in fiscal  1985  to offset one-half of any reduc tion  in interest rates by commercial  lenders under  the Debt Adjustment  Program. We just took care of lenders  on Saturday by putting the cash-flow  requirement down from $110 to $100.  Now they are back wanting us to pick  up their part of the interest payment.  In addition, under the resolution we  agreed to on Saturday, there was no  $650 million cap-there was no cap at  all. But now we come back and say,  ""Well, we are going to require an addi tional $1.85 billion, a total of $2.5 bil lion,"" when  there  is no cap at  the  present time.  This amendment would also allow  lenders  to qualify  for  a  90-percent  guarantee on loans, principal, and in terest, under  the Debt Adjustment  Program, without requiring either a  writedown  of  principal  or  interest.  This works  to the detriment of the  entire program.  It reduces Farmers  Home cash-flow requirements  to 100  percent, and-could result in a Farm ers Home takeover of about $2.5 bil lion  in nonconforming or classified  loans. So I think we should make the  record clear on what this amendment  does.  Let me further discuss some of the  principal  areas. First,  interest buy down. There has been a great deal of  talk about how the interest buydown  provision  in  the  amendment would  reduce the interest costs of a farm bor rower whose  loans are  restructured  under the Debt Adjustment Program.  The suggestion has been that the Gov ernment would match the reduction in  interest rates on these loans by com mercial and cooperative lenders. The  fact is, Mr. President, I believe this in terest buydown is nothing less  than,  an effort to help the banks. Under the  Debt Adjustment Program, banks are  required to write down the principal or  interest rate on eligible farm loans to  the point where  the farm borrower  can show a 100-percent cash-flow. We  did that on Saturday. In exchange for  the writedown-this is what it was all  ",1985
256,860,3,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, will the  Senator yield for another question?  ",1985
257,860,3,Mr. SYMMS., Certainly.  ,1985
258,860,3,Mr. SASSER.," Following that logic,  would it not follow that every Senator  who did not object to the unanimous consent request then favors increasing  the Federal deficit to borrow money  for the African relief bill?  ",1985

If the Senator  from Tennessee opposes it, then I sug gest that he vote no. What I have pro posed  is not related  to  the African  relief bill, which, in fact, it could not  be under  the  rule  that we operate  under here. What I propose is that in  the  provisions  of  the  amendments  which have been added to this bill and  possibly will be added, or implement ed, the money be reprogrammed from  existing expenditures to hold the Fed eral deficit harmless, the logic being a  simple and, I think, irrefutable in that  the farmer  is hurt more by deficits  and high interest rates than any other  factor in our society.  I thank the Senator.  ",1985

I  urge my colleagues that we are pre pared then  to  take up  the so-called  Dixon amendment. If we can avoid ex tensive debate, we may be able to dis pose of that.

263,860,3,Mr. ZORINSKY.," Mr. President,  thank the Chair.  It is unfortunate that our efforts to  help farmers had to become involved  in a political morass on the floor of  the Senate. I can assure every one of  my colleagues on both sides of  the  aisle that I will do everything I can to  make  sure  that  farmers  are made  aware of how this package was put to gether and how the pending amend ment attempts to gut the credit pro posal that was just approved.  I take a back seat to no one in bal ancing  the  budget  and my  voting  record is out there for everyone to see.  Let me assure you, Mr. President,  that this is a litmus test not on budget  busting but how you feel about the  future of agriculture, how you  feel  about saving a few farmers. I saw the  cost of the PIK Program last year that I never even had a chance to vote  on. It was concocted through the dis cretionary authority of the executive  branch of Government. Under  that  program, billions of dollars were spent,  I  and nobody asked me if I wanted to  bust the budget with that program.  All I want to say in conclusion, Mr.  President, is that I have listened to us  talking  about delaying  sending out  Federal pension checks to throw the  cost from  this year's budget to next  year's budget-to pick up $1.5 billion  to keep from ""busting"" the budget. I  have seen us play the shell game. I  have seen us play every game in this  Chamber.  But I am proud to bust the budget if  it comes  to saving  the farmers who  provide  food  for  the people of  this  country.  That is all I have to say, Mr. Presi dent.

269,860,3,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I have  voted against the amendment of the  Senator from Texas which would have  vitiated  the action  the Senate  took  earlier today to help American farm ers who are facing bankruptcy. The  idea of adopting a constructive piece  of  farming  legislation and  then  in structing the executive branch not to  administer  it-as  this  amendment  would have done-makes no sense to  me.  The $200 billion deficits  that  this  country faces must not be dealt with  in this back door manner. I believe the  way to deal with deficits is to bring a  complete budget freeze to the floor of  the Senate as quickly as possible and  adopt it. Such a freeze should freeze  everything-defense, agriculture, cost of-living adjustments, other domestic  spending. I am prepared to vote for  such a freeze and I hope the leader ship on the other side of the aisle will  bring the matter up for action prompt ly.  I hope that we will not see any more  efforts to make political capital at the  expense of the American farmer-or  any other group of Americans. Howev er, I suppose the Senator from Texas  will be offering  this amendment  to  every  bill  that  comes  before  the  Senate.

I appreciate the  reservations she has about  the $175  million  in new budget authority au thorized by this bill. The dilemma we  face is that AID's reprogramming au thority has limits on the amounts that  can  be  transferred. Moreover,  the  identification of specific projects that  can be postponed takes time, and the  emergency accounts are getting peril ously low on funds. I share the hope  that AID can carefully scrutinize  its  present operations and projects to dis cover ways that a significant portion  of  the  increased  authorization  for  emergency programs can be off set by  reductions in other, nonemergency ac counts. It might be a very good prece dent for us to see AID return to the  Treasury  as  unspent  an  off setting  amount at the end of this fiscal year.  I assure  the distinguished Senator  from Kansas  that she will have my  full support and cooperation in press ing AID to review all new projects and  to consider delaying some lower priori ty projects  temporarily  in order  to  keep overall AID obligations as close  as  possible  to  currently  authorized  levels.

285,873,3,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  AMERICAN AGRICULTURE AT A CROSSROAD  ",1985
286,873,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, it  is a bitter but true irony that Ameri can farmers  today face  the worst of  times at the time they have achieved  their greatest farming success.  American agriculture today is at the  height of productivity. Some 2.4 mil lion American  farmers-less  than 3  percent of our people-feed an entire  nation of 220 million and have enough  left over to export $38 billion in food  to other nations. Even more incredible  is  that  less  than  500,000  farmers  produce most of our food. Since 1930,  farmers  have  increased  agricultural  production 2 V2 times.  American agriculture  is  a modern  day success story, and the envy of an  often starving world.  What overshadows  this  success  is  the grim, stark, inescapable fact that  many farmers are going broke. Today  farm debt is to the farmer what a sum mer's hailstorm  is  to wheat-punish ing, devastating, crippling. Many farm ers  face an unprecedented  financial  crisis. The  reasons  are many: Low  farm  prices,  high production  costs,  slow growth  in export markets, de creasing value for farmland, huge cap ital requirements, high  interest cost,  and  tangled  and  counterproductive  Federal farm, trade, and fiscal policies.  For many  the  situation  is  bleak.  Farmers cannot generate the income  to service their debts, and consequent ly are scrambling to secure operating  loans for spring planting.  For many farmers, the root of the  present difficulties lie in the events of  the  1970's. First,  farmers, who  are  great energy users were bombed with  energy prices that tripled in a decade.  Next  the soaring, double-digit  infla tion, the legacy of the Carter adminis tration,  further drove up operating  costs. Then interest rates hit a record  21 V2  percent. The  only  protection  farmers had against this triple threat  was rising land prices and, in droves,  farmers on the advice of their Govern ment  and  their  bankers  borrowed  against their land.  Then, in 1980, agriculture was dealt  a severe blow by the embargo on agri cultural exports to the Soviet Union,  our largest market for wheat exports.  The U.S. share of the Soviet market  went from 70 percent to 20 percent.  Importing nations  shied away  from  the United States as an unreliable sup plier, and other food exporting nations  increased their production.  A  shriveled export market, excess  production, high costs and high inter est  rates  rapidly  eroded  cash-flow.  Once  cash-flow was  eroded, many  farmers could not meet interest pay ments, triggering a precipitous and un precendented decline  in the value of  farm land. Today, many farmers are  experiencing  a  debt/credit  crunch  caused by falling land values, high real  interest rates and declining commodity  prices. Lenders, painfully aware of the  declining value of  farm  assets,  are  carefully weighing further extension  of credit, and in many instances, deny ing credit  farmers need  to  finance  spring planting.  It is a grim situation in rural Amer ica.  Estimates of the number of farmers  facing difficulty vary, but  the most  solid data shows financial difficulties  to be concentrated in about a third, or  210,000,  of  the  Nation's  700,000  medium and large sized farms.  These operations are primarily com mercial family farmers whose yearly  income  ranges  from  $40,000  to  $500,000. The  latest official within  group  figures  report  that  of  the  210,000 farm operations with severe fi nancial  problems  have  debts  that  equal at  least 40  percent of  their  assets. This means, simply,  they will  have difficulty meeting interest pay ments on their debts this year. Even  worse,  about 100,000  farms  in  this  income have debts at least equal to 70  percent of  their  assets. Altogether,  these 210,000 farmers owe about two thirds of the total farm debt estimated  to be $200 billion.  The situation may even be worse,  Mr. President, than what are indicated  in these months old official reports. In  the  last few months,  there has not  only been a remarkable decline in land  values but so much land is now on the  market, with no bidders, no one can be  sure what current market values of  farm land are. This decline is inexora bly increasing the debt to asset ratio.  Many areas are reporting distress sales  as low one-third to one-half of what  the land was valued at a year ago.  This farm debt situation in general  and the declining value of land in par ticular  is  not  only  affecting  those  farmers with debt, it also carries the  potential of adversely affecting those  with moderate debt with conservative  debt  to asset  ratios. That's because  there is so much farm land in desper ate need to be sold that foreclosures  could  trigger even  lower values  for  farm  land, with  truly disastrous  re sults for both farmers and lenders.

288,886,3,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. President, the only  thing new about comparable worth is  its name. This time the issue is equal  pay for equivalent work. The public  policy question is the same as it was in  1938 when Congress passed the Fair  Labor Standards Act. It is the same as  it was in 1963 when the Equal Pay Act  was enacted and it is  the same as it  was when title VII of the Civil Rights  Act was passed in 1964. The issue  is  the elimination of wage discrimination  based on sex.  As far back as the mid-1960's shortly  after I came into office as Governor, I  found  I was having difficulty  in at tracting  talented managers  to State  government. In addition, there was no  apparent consistency at that time be tween State departments and  their  wage-setting practices. It is significant  to note that I began by seeking advice  from leaders in private industry in my  State. They  told me  the State pay  structure was not competitive with pri vate industry, particularly in manage rial ranks. We then launched a study  to determine what various  jobs were  worth  in  the marketplace,  to State  government, and how they all fit to gether  internally  in  the State pay  system. We hired the same consultants  who had been advising major regional  corporations on job valuations. The re sults were astonishing. Tradition, ne glect, and lack of analytical models re sulting in overpaying some managers  while  drastically  shortchanging  others. Using methods borrowed from  private  industry we made significant  changes. We  realigned positions. We  raised salaries for some positions sub stantially, and froze salaries on other  positions until they returned to align ment as a result of the studies.  It is important to emphasize that we  were not out to prove that there was  discrimination. It was almost by acci dent that we discovered the disparities  between male and female dominated  occupations in a much broader analy sis of job alignments. Further studies  were initiated to insure that key civil  service benchmark positions bore an  appropriate relationship to managerial  salaries. We found consistent and dis turbing aberrations at all pay levels.  Jobs held primarily by women consist ently were underpaid when measured  against comparable jobs held primari ly by men. For example, animal tech nicians,  a  glorified  term  for  zoo keepers,  received  far higher salaries  than child care specialists. We paid  more to take care of our animals than  our children. It is amazing to me now  that so many opponents of comparable  worth  look on the whole method of  job analysis as being some new and  strange device, unproven and unused.  That simply  is  false.  In  fact,  two thirds of the adult age population are  pay graded by job evaluation methods.  In response to charges that compa rable worth  is as ""looney as  looney  tunes.""  I'd say Clarence Pendleton  hasn't  examined modern  compensa tion management lately.  He  and others have  assailed  the  techniques of job evaluation as being  subjective. All methods of wage deter mination,  including the marketplace,  are  subjective  to  some degree. The  common elements of  job evaluation;  skill, effort, responsibility, and work ing conditions are no more arbitrary  than the abnormalities and distortions  present in the external market place.  The marketplace, they say, is the only  fair  and  equitable  determinant  of  wages. According to this analysis work ers should move from job to job in re sponse  to  the  laws  of  supply  and  demand. Similarly, employers will pay  a higher wage  for  labor where  the  quantity is small and the demand is  high and a lower wage for labor that is  abundance of existing demand. In the  real world,  labor markets are hardly  bastions of perfect competition. Work ers and employers have limited infor mation of job availability and employ ees are not completely mobile, espe cially when  they have accumulated  senority and pension rights. The exist ence of collective bargaining further  complicates this model of perfection.  In fact,  the result of  this collective  bargaining process often results in a  negotiated wage  that bears little ra tional relationship to the free market  and we  are currently  suffering  the  consequences of this in international  competition.  These  distortions  are  amplified  when considering salary setting within  a governmental body as large as  the  Federal or State government. With  nearly 3 million employees, the Feder al Government  is  the single  largest  employer  in  the Nation. Within  the  Federal classification system there are  approximately 7,000 types of positions  that correspond  to  series or grade  levels of pay. The complexity of salary  setting for Federal employees is more  readily  seen when  comparing  it  to  State government and large corpora tions. The State of Washington has  2,300  civil  service classifications. By  comparison, the Ford Motor Co. has  5,000  position  classifications  and  AT&T has approximately 3,350 posi tions under  its current classification  system. A few years ago, AT&T insti tuted a  new  job evaluation process  which took into account technological  change within the industry that had  produced an excessive number of job  titles, many different names for these  jobs and not much difference in  job  content. Similarly, many of the factors  and criteria that are used to determine  wages in Federal pay practices are the  same as they were in 1923 when the  major Federal compensation systems  were established. Since their inception  62 years ago they have never been for mally studied for sex bias. Thus, I be lieve it is imperative that Congress ini tiate a  comprehensive study of  the  wage-setting practices within the Fed eral work force. The legislation I am  introducing today calls for such a com prehensive examination. The intent of  this measure is to seek facts and not  prejudge results.  This legislation establishes a Com mission on Compensation Equity with  representatives selected by the Presi dent, Congress, and employee organi zations. The Commission would  be  charged with the responsibilities of se lecting, from a list prepared by GAO,  a private contractor to carry out the  study itself and of submitting to the  President and Congress,  its  findings  and  recommendations based on  the  contractor's study. It is my intention  that this measure will serve as a vehi cle for discussion of the GAO report  which will be submitted to Congress  tomorrow. This  report, which will  detail the appropriate scope, method ology, and other technical aspects for  studying  the  Federal  classification  system was requested by me, Senator  STEVENS,  Senator  CRANSTON.  and  House leaders last November. It is my  hope  that  relevant  findings  of  the  GAO report will be incorporated into  this legislation and used as guidance  for the conduct of the study contem plated.  The need in 1985 for Federal action  in this area of wage discrimination is  ",1985
289,899,3,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  today I am reintroducing a bill which  would grant a national charter to the  Retired Enlisted Association, Inc. My  colleague, Congressman KEN KRAMER,  is introducing a companion bill in the  House.  TREA is a not-for-profit retired mili tary veteran's organization that seeks  ""to promote and assist  its members  professionally and culturally, both lo cally and nationally,  to uphold  the  Constitution of the United States, to  def end the United States from all her  enemies,  to  improve the relationship  between the military and civilian pop ulace, and to maintain liaison with the  active  personnel  of  the  Armed  Forces.""  Started in my home State of Colora do, TREA has gained  some  26,000  members  from all 50 States, Guam,  the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and  overseas. Its members are made up of  retired  enlisted personnel  from  the  U.S. Armed Forces.  In  a  practical  sense, TREA serves  its members by  lobbying  Congress  to  protect  the  rights and benefits of retired military  personnel and to alert members to leg islation that affects them. It also pro motes national security objectives and  support for our Armed Forces.  The members of TREA are  those  men and women who answered  the  call of their country when they were  needed, and who served with honor,  dedication, and personal sacrifice. It is  appropriate that we in Congress grate fully  acknowledge  the  service  they  have given to this great country.  There! ore, I urge you to join me in  cosponsoring this bill to charter TREA  so  that  it may  further  its work on  behalf of enlisted retirees.

290,964,3,Mr. BYRD.," Mr.  President, most  people identify the U.S. Senate with  the names and deeds of famous Sena tors, past and present, who have lent  the Senate its aura of glamor and tra dition.  But  those most familiar with  the  Senate also know that this institution  depends for  its day-to-day efficiency  and effectiveness on the good work of  countless men and women, most of  whose names go unheralded by  the  media and whose value and contribu tions may be appreciated only by a  handful of people. Most of those staff  men and women serve faithfully for a  time, and then they go on to pursue  some other career, or move quietly  into retirement.  At  times, however, a Senate staff  person has served so many different  Senators so well and so long that his  or her unrecognized departure would  signify a breach of etiquette and com munity responsibility.  Such is the instance of this week's  retirement of Randall C. Degges as a  floor  assistant  for  the Sergeant at  Arms Office. Since March 1971, Mr.  Degges-fondly known by  the nick name  ""Puggy""-has  served  on  the  Democratic side of the aisle. Through  eight Congresses, he has helped  to  maintain the security and decorum of  the Senate, and he has won the grati tude and admiration of his coworkers  and many Senators for the conscien tious way in which he has fulfilled his  responsibilities. Mr. Degges will be sin cerely missed when  he  leaves  his  Senate post tomorrow.  But  the  qualities  that  ""Puggy""  Degges demonstrated in carrying out  his Senate floor duties have been evi dent throughout his life. A native of  Takoma Park, MD, and a graduate of  Bladensburg High School, in 1941, at  age 21, Mr. Degges joined the Wash ington Metropolitan Police Depart ment. In 1961, he was detailed to be in  charge of the Metropolitan Police De partment's plainclothes detail here on  Capitol Hill. As a policeman, he rose  to the rank of captain, and received  numerous  commendations,  including  ""Policeman of the Month"" and ""Po liceman of the Year."" Doing his job  well has been one of Randall Degges'  characteristic habits.  In his retirement, Mr. Degges will  continue to enjoy the companionship  of his wife of 47 years-her name is  Kathleen-and the love and honor of  his 7 children and 16 grandchildren. I  can assure him that he will also con tinue to enjoy the esteem and warm  good wishes of those Senators whom  he has served so well for 14 years. We  hope for him the best as he enters re tirement, and anticipate that among  his rewards justly earned he will count  the memories of the duties he faith fully  rendered  to his fell ow citizens  and his country as a policeman, and to  the U.S. Senate as a member of its  staff.  Mr. President, I want to personally  wish Mr. Degges a long and delightful  retirement. He is really a good man.  Mr. President,  I  thank the distin guished majority whip for his patience  and his courtesy. I know he is tired, as  are others, but he will find as he goes  along, as  I have  found,  that many  times when the others have been able  to say goodnight and go home to a  little food-we called it supper back in  my days-the distinguished majority  whip and I, and the distinguished ma jority leader, and other Senate officers  and staff will have to wait and do addi tional work before we can go to our  rest from the day's labors.  Mr. President, I wish to add my good  wishes and congratulations as well to  Mr. Cahill.  The distinguished majority whip has  been very cordial, courteous, and un derstanding, and  I  thank him, as  I  yield the floor.  ",1985

293,977,3,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr.  Speaker,  this morning Secretary of State Shultz  told members of  the Committee on  Foreign Affairs that the administra tion will not fund the Contras by di verting economic assistance funds in tended for Honduras. He further as sured the committee that the adminis tration will not fund the Contras by  any method not authorized by  the  Congress.  Thus if Congress refuses to reverse  the cutoff of funds to the Contras, the  administration's  illegal war  should  come to an end in Nicaragua. But one  never knows. Congress must make sure  the administration does not use illegal  means  to  fund an  illegal war. Nor  should we approve legal or overt fund ing which would allow the administra tion and its escalating rhetoric to pull  America into a war in Central Amer ica.  The time to end the war is now and  the only way to do it is to cut off all  funding,  legal  or  illegal,  covert or  overt. There is only one way  to get  this administration to the peace table  in Central America: Drag it there.

294,977,3,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker,  today  this House will consider the Emergen cy Farm Credit Relief Act. This legis lation is critically needed if economic  catastrophe is to be avoided. Let us be  very clear what is at stake: If this Con gress fails to act, or if the administra tion vetoes this bill as has been threat ened, literally thousands of farmers all  across this country will go under.  The ripple effects of their economic  failure will be  felt  throughout  the  economy. In my own State of Michi gan, there are 5,000 farmers that face  bankruptcy  they  cannot  obtain  credit  to plant  their  crops  in  the  coming weeks. Nationally, it is estimat ed that up to 30 percent of all farm  operations could go under.  We need  to understand  that  the  farm crisis is not simply a crisis facing  farmers: It is a crisis that falls on all  of us. If immediate credit is not forth coming it would cripple industries who  supply equipment to the farm commu nity, cripple the financial institutions  dependent  upon  the  agricultural  sector, cripple small businesses, and fi nally could cause the ultimate demise  of our rural communities. It is clear,  that neither our cities or our rural  communities can escape this crisis.  We are  threatened,  literally, by a  path of serious economic disruption in  every region and community  in our  country if we fail to take action. I urge  my colleagues  to pass  this critically  important legislation.  if  U.S. POLICY TOWARD  NICARAGUA  <Mr. STUDDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
295,977,3,Mr.  STUDDS.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  President of the United States would  have us alter by  force  the present  structure of the Government of Nica ragua. That is tantamount to a decla ration of war.  The President wants Congress  to  resume  funding  for military  oper ations directed against the people and  territory of Nicaragua. That,  too,  is  tantamount to a declaration of war.  The President is unwilling to def end  before the world court the actions of  our Government toward Nicaragua be cause  those actions are legally  inde fensible in the absence of a state of  war.  The President has called upon the  American people to support what he  calls a crusade for human freedom. In  fact, he is calling upon our people, di rectly and through surrogates, to wage  war.  War is a simple solution. It means  you kill  those with whom you dis agree.  It means you kill until  the  other side cries ""uncle.""  Is  the  history  of Nicaragua  simple?  the  simple?  Is this what the struggle for freedom  is all about?  Is this the best we can do?  The answer to these questions, Mr.  President,  is  no. Your  rhetoric  is  empty; it does not persuade.  Put aside  this simple  talk of war,  and join with us in the far more com plex and far more rewarding task of  encouraging  peace,  real  democracy,  and social justice in Central America.  of Nicaragua  present  Is  so  so  CALLING THE CONTRAS  ""FREE DOM  FIGHTERS"" WILL  NOT  REVERSE  FAILED  POLICY  IN  NICARAGUA  <Mr. DURBIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.>  ",1985
296,977,3,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, Nicara gua has been a secret which everyone  knows. The secret war that makes the  headlines and the secret U.S. strategy  of overthrowing the Sandinista gov ernment that even the President now  admits.  The inconsistencies of our policy in  that nation are no secret to anyone.  We drive Nicaragua into the arms of  the Kremlin and we are shocked when  we find them there. We disparage the  efforts of our neighbors for naively  seeking peace through negotiations as  we stoke the fires of war with our mil lions.  We speak of our tradition of free dom in a nation where our legacy of  supporting a dictator is still fresh in  their minds.  President Reagan is a skillful politi cian. He could tiptoe across a beach  without leaving a footprint. But call ing  the Contras ""freedom  fighters""  will not breathe  life  into our failed  foreign policy in Central America or  slow down our steady march toward an  even deeper military  involvement  in  that region.

In less than 3 weeks time from the  date of  introduction,  the committee  has thoroughly considered and debat ed the emergency measures contained  in this bill, and brought it to the full  House for a vote. As far as I know, this  fast track has set a record pace for leg islation of this significance. This truly  should demonstrate to America's farm ers that the House of Representatives  does understand their dilemma, and is  committed  to doing something con crete about it.  H.R. 1035  is not meant to be  the  long-term cure for what ails agricul ture; our committee will address long term solutions later this year when we  develop the Omnibus Food and Agri culture bill. However,  this bill  is a  much needed, prudent effort to throw  a lifeline to tens of thousands of our  Nation's farmers who need short-term  credit assistance to help them stay in  business in the 1985 crop year, and  until a new long-term farm policy can  adopted which will  carry  us  through this decade.  This emergency legislation addresses  the credit crisis in a direct and respon sible way by:  Providing much needed,  immediate  assistance  in  the form of expanded  Farmers  Home  Administration  CFmHAl loan guarantees for operating  credit and debt refinancing;  FmHA direct operating loans at re duced interest rates to recent victims  of multiple weather disasters;  Advance recourse commodity  loans  from the Commodity Credit Corpora tion CCCCl  for use in covering 1985  production expenses, and  Improved terms for existing FmHA  debt adjustment programs.  No amount of credit can take the  place of better prices to farmers for  the commodities  they produce. But  without  the  limited and  temporary  emergency measures contained in H.R.  1035, perhaps as many as one-third of  our Nation's producers may be forced  to leave farming within the next year  or so. This bill is only the first step if  we expect to see the return of profit to  agriculture, but it is a much needed  first step.  As a realistic effort to avoid further  economic disaster which rural America  cannot survive, I urge my colleagues of  the House to support this bill.  ",1985

It is no secret around this august in stitution that key staff members per form  an  invaluable  service  to  the  Members and to the country.  All too often they are unknown to  the public, which is as it should be.  I was once a staff member and I  know there has to be that passion for  anonymity among staffers. There has  to be the desire to get the work done  and avoid  the spotlight. That  is a  noble point of view; but there come  times when it is in the interest of the  Members  and  this  institution  that  public recognition be given  to  truly  outstanding work  by  a  key  staff  member. Today is one of those rare oc casions.  Today  I  speak  in honor of Keith  Mainland, who has been clerk of the  Appropriations Committee since 1972.  I served on that committee for many,  many years, and one picture that re mains in my mind is of Keith Main land seated at the big table during one  of  those nerve-wracking,  end-of-the session marathons in the Appropria tions Committee just off the floor of  this House.

306,1029,3,Mr.  ROTH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  taking this time today to again urge  the enactment of an interstate cost es timate bill. We need an ICE bill now,  and every day we delay we do a dis service to the American people.  The  interstate  cost  estimate  is  a  laundry list of highway projects put  forth by each State. These projects  are funded through the highway trust  fund, which gets its revenue from the  9-cents-a-gallon gas  tax. Under  the  1982 Surface Transportation Act, Con gress must enact an interstate cost es timate every other year before funds  are released to the States. Apparently  Congress  isn't living up  to  its own  rules.  It really is not necessary to go into  detailed history of the interstate cost  estimate legislation of last year. The  bottom line is that, primarily because  of  a  fundamental  disagreement be tween  this body and  the other one  over  the  issue  of  demonstration  projects, we failed to approve last year  about $7 billion  in highway project  funding to cover an 18-month period.  The consequence of our failure  to  act is that some 42 States, including  my own State of Wisconsin, are eff ec tively out of highway  construction  money.  The American  people  are  paying 9 cents  in Federal  taxes for  every gallon of gasoline they buy. But  they are not getting a return on this  investment,  because  the money  is  gathering dust in Washington.  The cost of this delay is enormous in  terms of jobs, infrastructure deteriora tion, inflation, and total chaos within  the highway industry.  In all, some 200 highway projects  have been shelved. A quarter million  highway construction jobs have been  put on hold. Each day we delay brings  us closer to another highway construc tion  season.  Problems  of  highway  safety and  traffic congestion, which  could be eased by the release of high way funds, continue to get worse.  Mr. Speaker, last December I wrote  to all 50 Governors to request their  help  in  pushing  the  congressional  leadership for quick passage of an ICE  bill  in the 99th Congress. Their re sponses to me indicate just how seri ous  is  the problem  the States are  facing.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE RoTH: I am writing  in response  to your  letter requesting my  support  in urging Congress  to enact  the  Interstate Cost Infrastructure measure.  As a Governor, I am extremely concerned  with the failure of Congress to approve the  ICE and the Interstate Substitute Cost F.sti mate which were submitted by the United  States Department of Transportation  in  March 1983. Because of this impasse, Con necticut has been unable to spend approxi mately $114 million of Interstate Funds and  $138 million  of  Interstate  Substitution  Funds. Further  delays  in  authorization  could jeopardize over $200 million in badly  needed Infrastructure renewal projects.  I have been in constant contact with our  Congressional delegation  requesting  their  support in obtaining the necessary approval  for these funds. Please be assured that I will  continue to work towards passage of this  measure.  Sincerely,  WILLIAM A. O'NEILL,  Governor.  COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA,  OFFICE OF THE GoVERNOR,  Richmond, VA, December 27, 1984.  Hon. TOBY ROTH,  House of Representatives, Cannon House  Office Building, Washington. DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RoTH: Thank you for  your letter of December 4, 1984, regarding  the problems created by the failure of Con gress to approve the Interstate Cost F.sti mate.  As I am sure you are aware, Virginia's con gressional delegation has been active in pro testing delay  in  the release of  interstate  construction funds. To date, Virginia has  been able  to award some $66 million  in  interstate contracts under the ACI provi sions of federal statute. However, contracts  and modifications  to work already under  way estimated to cost over $40 million are  being delayed. Further, if Congress does not  act on the ICE before May 1985, almost  $190 million  in  interstate  contracts and  modifications will need to be deferred. In  my view, Congress must act responsibly and  pass a ""clean ICE"" at the earliest possible  opportunity  in the new Congress.  I  trust  that all members are very much aware of  this need, and that responsible action will  be forthcoming.  I appreciate your keeping me advised of  your efforts in reaching a solution to this  problem.  Sincerely,  CHARLES S. ROBB.

A release  of withheld highway funding will be applied  to converting ACI Projects <advance con struction  interstate)  projects  to  federal  funds intended to reimburse a state revolv ing account established by the State Legisla ture.  Therefore, the problem is not as acute in  New Mexico as in other states. Nevertheless,  we are concerned by  the fact  that state  funding should be  reimbursed by federal  funds as soon as possible, to maintain the  ability of the State of New Mexico to con tinue to provide funding for matching avail able federal aid.  We will continue to address the problem  through our  congressional  delegation  to  appeal to House Speaker Tip O'Neill and  others regarding the necessity of breaking  the log jam which has prevented passage of  a bill to release withheld interstate funding.  We are attaching a copy of the resolution  adopted by  the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials  <AASHTO) which  the New Mexico State  Highway Department supported.  Sincerely,  TONEY ANAYA,  Governor.  ",1985
307,1068,3,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, pursu ant  to  rule XI,  clause  2<a>  of  the  House of Representatives,  I present  the rules of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce for the 99th Congress  and ask that they be printed in the  RECORD at this point. These rules were  adopted  in an open  session of  the  Committee on February 26, 1985.  RULES FOR THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND  COMMERCE,  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES,  99TH CONGRESS  Rule 1, Rules of the House. The Rules of  the House are the rules of its committees  and its subcommittees so far as is applica ble, except that a motion to recess from day  to day is a motion of high privilege in com mittee and subcommittees. Written  rules  adopted by the committee, not inconsistent  with the Rules of the House, shall be bind ing on each subcommittee of the committee.  Each subcommittee of the committee is part  of the committee and is subject to the au thority and direction of  the committee.  Rule XI of the Rules of the House, which  pertains entirely to committee procedure, is  incorporated and made a part of the rules of  this committee, which are supplementary to  the Rules of the House.  Rule 2. Time, Place of Meetings. <a> The  committee shall meet on the forth Tuesday  of each month and at such other times as  determined by the chairman, or pursuant to  subparagraph <b>. in Room 2123 of the Ray burn House Office Building, at 9:45 a.m. for  the consideration of b!lls, resolutions, and  other business, if the House is in session on  that day. If the House is not in session on  that day and the committee has not met  during such month,  the committee shall  meet at such time and place on the first day  thereafter when the House is in session.  <b> The chairman may call and convene,  as he considers necessary, additional meet ings of the committee for the consideration  of any bill or resolution pending before the  committee or for the conduct of other com mittee business. The committee shall meet  for such purposes pursuant to that call of  the chairman.  <c> If at least three members of the com mittee or subcommittee <whichever is appli cable> desire that a special meeting of the  committee or subcommittee <whichever  is  applicable) be called by the chairman or  subcommittee  chairman,  those members  may file  in the offices of the committee  their written request to  the chairman or  subcommittee  chairman  for  that  special  meeting. Such  request  shall  specify  the  measure or matter to be considered. Imme diately upon the filing of the request, the  clerk of  the committee shall notify  the  chairman or subcommittee chairman of the  filing of the request. If, within 3 calendar  days after  the filing of  the request,  the  chairman or subcommittee chairman does  not call the requested special meeting to be  held within 7 calendar days after the filing  of the request, a majority of the members of  the committee or subcommittee <whichever  is applicable> may file in the offices of the  committee their written notice that a spe cial meeting of the committee or subcom mittee <whichever is applicable> will be held,  specifying the date and hour thereof, and  the measure or matter to be considered at  that special meeting. The committee or sub committee <whichever  is applicable> shall  meet on that date and hour. Immediately  upon the filing of the notice, the clerk of  the committee shall notify all members of  the committee or subcommittee <whichever  is applicable> that such meeting will be held  and inform them of its date and hour and  the measure or matter to be considered and  only the measure or matter specified in that  notice may be considered at that specified  meeting.  <d> If the chairman of the committee or  subcommittee is not present at any meeting  of  the committee or  subcommittee,  the  ranking member of the majority party on  the  committee or  subcommittee who  is  present shall preside at that meeting.  <e> Each meeting of the committee or any  of its subcommittees for the transaction of  business,  including  hearings  and  the  markup of legislation, shall be open to the  public except when the committee or sub committee  in open  session  and with  a  quorum present determines by rollcall vote  that all or part of the remainder of the  meeting on that day shall be closed to the  public. This paragraph does not apply to  those special cases provided in the Rules of  the House where closed sessions are other wise provided.  (f) At least once a month, the chairman  shall convene a meeting of the chairmen of  the  subcommittees. The purpose of  the  meeting will be to discuss  issues pending  before the committee and the procedures  for committee consideration of such mat ters. The discussion may  include, among  other items, the scheduling of hearings and  meetings, questions of subcommittee Juris diction and the conduct of Joint subcommit tee hearings.  Rule 3. Agenda. The agenda for each com mittee  or  subcommittee meeting <other  than a hearing), setting out the date, time,  place, and all items of business to be consid ered, shall be provided to each member of  the committee by delivery to his office at  least 36 hours in advance of such meeting.  Rule 4. Procedure. <a>< 1 > The date, time,  place, and subject matter of any hearing of  the committee or any of its subcommittees  shall be announced at least 1 week in ad vance of the commencement of such hear ing, unless the committee or subcommittee  determines in accordance with such proce dure as it may prescribe, that there is good  cause to begin the hearing sooner.  <2><A> The date, time, place, and subject  matter of any meeting <other than a hear ing) scheduled on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or  Thursday when the House will be in session,  shall be announced at least 36 hours in ad vance of the commencement of such meet ing.  <B> The time, place, and subject matter of  a meeting <other than a hearing or a meet ing  to which  subparagraph  <A>  applies>  shall be announced at least 72 hours in ad vance of the commencement of such meet ing.  <b> Each witness who is to appear before  the committee or subcommittee shall file  with the clerk of the committee, at least two  working days in advance of his appearance,  fifty <50> copies of a written statement of  his proposed testimony and shall limit his  oral presentation at his appearance  to a  brief summary of his argument, unless this  requirement, or any part thereof, is waived  by the committee or subcommittee chair man presiding.  <c> The right to interrogate the witnesses  before the committee or any of its subcom mittees  shall alternate between majority  and minority members. Each member shall  be limited to 5 minutes in the interrogation  of witnesses until such time as each member  who so desires has had an opportunity to  question witnesses. No member shall be rec ognized for a second period of 5 minutes to  interrogate a witness until each member of  the committee present has been recognized  once for that purpose. While the committee  or subcommittee is operating under the 5minute rule for  the interrogation of wit nesses,  the chairman  shall  recognize  in  order of appearance members who were not  present when  the meeting was called  to  order after all members who were present  when the meeting was called to order have  been recognized in the order of seniority on  the committee of subcommittee, as the case  maybe.  <d> No  bill,  recommendation, or other  matter reported by a subcommittee shall be  considered by the full committee unless the  text of the matter reported, together with  an explanation, has been available to mem bers of the committee for at least 36 hours.  Such explanation shall include a summary  of the major provisions of the legislation, an  explanation  of  the  relationship  of  the  matter to present law, and a summary of  the need for the legislation.

In the case of a meeting other  than a hearing,  the number of members  constituting a quorum shall be one-third of  the members of the committee or subcom mittee, except that a matter may not be re ported by the committee or a subcommittee  unless a majority of the members thereof is  actually present.  Rule 7. Proxies. No vote by any member of  the committee or any of its subcommittees  with respect to any measure or matter may  be cast by proxy unless a proxy authoriza tion is given in writing by the member desir ing  to cast a proxy, which authorization  shall assert that the member is absent on  official business or is absent due to personal  illness and is thus unable to be present at  the meeting of the committee or subcom mittee, and shall be limited to a specific  measure or matter and any amendments or  motions pertaining thereto.

308,1081,3,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I was  struck by the clarity and truthfulness  of the recent article by George F. Will  that appeared in the Washington Post  on Thursday, February 21, 1985. Mr.  Will points out much better than I the  obvious inconsistency followed by the  president of the University of the Pa cific.  It appears  that Mr. Stanley  McCaffrey, while  talking platitudes  about academic freedom and opportu nity in the field of higher education,  at the same time denies thP new Secre tary of Education the opportunity to  speak at this institution.  This  inconsistency  and  hypocrisy  have not gone unnoticed in the Halls  ",1985
309,1094,3,Mr. MRAZEK.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  often said that for every dark cloud,  there  is  a  silver  lining. For Jewish  people in the Soviet Union today, the  opposite  seems  to be  the case;  for  every silver cloud-the dream of emi grating  to  Israel-there  is  a  dark  lining-the Soviet Government. In the  last 6 years,  the world has seen the  number  of  Jews  allowed  to  leave  Russia rapidly dwindle from a high in  1979 of 51,320 people  to an abysmal  896 in 1984. Recently, and apparently  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  in concert with the policy of meager  emigration, the Soviet Union has in tensified its propaganda campaign to  discredit the refusenik population.  In November 1984, a 27-minute docu mentary aired on Leningrad television.  Titled  ""Hirelings  and Accomplices,""  the show sought to equate Soviet Jews  who seek  to emigrate  to Israel with  anti-Soviet behavior. Accompanied by  strains of Jewish music and footage of  the  Israeli-Arab military  confronta tion,  the film attempted to unfold a  Zionist conspiracy operating together  with the Central Intelligence Agency  and  influential powerbrokers of  the  American Jewish community. Its com mentators  allege  that  Jews  in  the  U.S.S.R. have been targeted for mass  emigration,  specifically  designed  to  provide  ""cannon  fodder  for  Israel's  continuing offense against  the Arab  world.""  It is ironic that at the most promis ing time in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations in  over 4 years,  that the Soviet Union  has chosen this time to manifest its  anti-Semitic policy agenda.  Today, 3 million Jews are caught in  a  catch-22  of  the  highest  order,  trapped in a country that is impossible  to  live  in-and  impossible  to  leave.  Jews who  try  to  leave  the Soviet  Union face years of living  in  limbo.  Once a Jew applies for an exit visa he  is dismissed from his job, and then ar rested for not having one. Even if it is  possible to avoid arrest, it is impossible  to avoid becoming a social outcast, and  impossible  to avoid  the harassment  and watchful eye of the KGB. Fami lies who apply for visas together can  expect cruel separation. If the Soviet  Government does grant a visa, it may  be only for a husband but not a wife,  or only a mother but not a child.  The grim reality of Soviet life today  for its Jewish citizens evokes the worst  in Orwellian  prophecy-1984  repre sented the worst year in terms of al lowable emigration  from  the Soviet  Union in nearly two decades. Coupled  with the increased propaganda effort  by the U.S.S.R. to discredit Jews, life  in Russia has sunk to an unprecedent ed horrendous level. These two factors  make it exceedingly clear that 1985 is  not the time to relax the vigilance on  these issues.  I encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to join in working for  the freedom of all Soviet Jews. In the  days and months ahead, as the United  States and Soviet Union once again  join  in peaceful dialog,  the  issue of  freedom for Soviet Jews must be high  on  the agenda. Soviet Jews ask for  nothing but  the opportunity  to be  free. As the leaders of the greatest de mocracy in the history of the human  race,  it is essential to do everything  within our powers to grant them this  wish. We must provide the silver lining  of freedom around this ever darkening  cloud of oppression.   February 27, 1985  CREDIT CARD SURCHARGE BAN  HON. DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1985  e ",1985
310,1094,3,Mr. DREIER  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, in the year ahead, the House  is almost certain to debate a ban on  credit card surcharges. The previous  ban expired over a year ago. In the  quiet before  the  impending lobbying  blitzkrieg in favor of a new temporary,  or possibly permanent ban, the follow ing article from the Los Angeles Times  is well worth reading. Its conclusion is  especially noteworthy:  The whole debate is almost academic, al though it keeps surfacing. In the year since  the surcharge expired, virtually nobody has  started the practice. And apart from gas sta tions, fewer than 6 percent of retailers <one  estimate says 0.2 percent offer discounts.  And why should  they,  since  its entirely  their choice.  I believe a credit card surcharge ban  is anticonsumer. More to the point, its  probably unnecessary.  I ask that the Los Angeles Times ar ticle be submitted to the RECORD  for  the benefit of my colleagues.  CFrom the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 19851  WHY DON'T CASH PAYERS GET CREDIT  THEY'RE DUE?  (By S.J. Diamond)  The  trouble with knowing how charge  cards work-what the credit costs consum ers, what the processing costs merchants-is  that one senses what such systems must add  to the price of goods. ""Credit card services  obviously cost something,"" complains one  California shopper, ""and it's obviously built  into everybody's price. If I don't use that  service, I should pay less than people who  do.""  As it happens, people, have been urging  two-tiered pricing for years. Most retailers,  however, see no advantage in making the  change, and ""third party"" card  issuers banks, MasterCard,  American  Express,  among others-actively  lobby  against  it,  given the possible decrease in card use. Un fortunately, both sides approach the issue  mostly with rhetoric, with no definitive ac counting of the costs of charge sales or the  likely effect of changing the system.  It seems generally  agreed  that charge  sales cost more, given both handling costs  and the processing fees that merchants pay  banks or card companies. Checks,  too,  in volve both handling and risk, of course, and  even ""taking cash is not free,"" says Ameri can Express Vice President Adrienne Cleere  at  its Western headquarters  in Torrance,  what with higher security, pilferage, book keeping. But all  things  considered,  says  Joanna Logsdon, general credit manager for  Bullock's stores in California, ""the cash cus tomer is less expensive.""  How much less is another question. A 1983  report from the Federal Reserve System's  board of governors gave the added cost of  credit card use as 2 percent or 3 percent of  the purchase-an estimate seemingly con firmed by gasoline dealers, who alone have  widely  adopted  two-tiered  pricing: Many  give people who pay cash a few cents off the  posted price of a gallon because distributors  ",1985
311,1107,3,Mr.  BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  federally  funded  research  programs at U.S. universities demon strate the versatility and strength in herent in the conduct of basic scientif ic research in this country. I point to  an example of this in my own congres sional district  through  the Depart ment of Physics at University of Cali fornia in Riverside. I had the pleasure  of seeing  the physics programs first  hand as a Regent's Lecturer for the  1984-85 academic year. I am very fa miliar with the activities of Prof. A.  Kernan and her team studying proton antiproton  interactions at very high  energies, Prof. B. Shen and his team  studying electron-positron interactions  at high energies, and Prof. S. Fung  and his team studying the interactions  of relativistic heavy-nuclei.  I speak with particular pride about  our support of such basic research in  the high energy physics and nuclear  physics which enabled,  for example,  Professor Kernan and her  team  to  make important contributions to the  experiment at CERN which led to the  discovery of the long-sought-after in termediate vector bosons-the W and  Z particles. These particles are be lieved to be the carriers of one of na ture's four basic forces,  the so-called  weak force, which is known to be re sponsible for, among other things, ra dioactivity. Moreover,  scientists  be lieve that the discovery of these inter mediate vector particles become  the  strongest experimental support so far  for  the unification of  two of  these  forces, the weak force and the electro magnetic  force. Therefore  it  is  be lieved to be the first and the most cru cial  step  toward validating  the  so called  grand  unification  theories,  which bind  together all of  the four  basic forces, from the force governing  nuclear interactions, to the force re sponsible for the motions of planets  and galaxies.  Federal funding for basic scientific  research at  the universities has, of  course, made all this possible. In the  past years, the Reagan administration  has supported research for particle ac celerators and other nuclear physics  facilities. This year, however, the level  of  funding has declined. Operating  funds for high energy physics facilities  are scheduled to drop from $546 mil lion to $51 O million, and as a  result  utilization of the accelerators will fall  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to between 55 and 45 percent of capac ity. Similarly, nuclear physics funding  is slated to decline. This is particularly  alarming if the universities are slated  to take the brunt of the cuts.  Mr. Speaker,  the backbone of our  scientific  and  technological  preemi nence is our commitment to basic sci entific research conducted by universi ties. This is no less true of our commit ment to highenergy physics research.  I urge my colleagues to consider this  as we examine the Department of En ergy's basic research budget.

315,1120,3,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  would the ""clear possibility"" of nucle ar winter help deter nuclear war? It  certainly should. The prospect of nu clear  winter  should  significantly  reduce the ranks of those who still be lieve that a major nuclear war would  only differ from a major conventional  war in degree. They believe it would be  bigger, more deadly, but still a war  that would come and go,  leave heart  breaking casualties. But then the war  would end. The United States and  other  nations would  rebuild.  Life  would go on. Some arg?!e that the su perpowers could fight a nuclear war  without  targeting cities. And  indeed  the principle deterring effect of nucle ar winter would be to help spare the  cities as nuclear winter  targets, be cause it is precisely the fires  in the  cities that would trigger the devastat ing world wide environmental calamity  of darkness and bitter cold with the  ensuing  catastrophic  destruction  of  the world's food supply. But realists  will recognize that the stakes would be  so high and rapid-fire decisions so im perative in a superpower nuclear war  that no risk, including the risk of all  the horrors of nuclear winter would be  enough  to deter the destruction,  in cluding demolition of cities once the  war starts. Furthermore, military tar gets are so close to population centers  that millions  of  civilian  casualties  would be a certainty and once either  superpower  suffered urban destruc tion, it would be likely to retaliate in  kind.  So the prime deterrence would have  to come at the very beginning before  the first nuclear weapons ignited all out war. And here is where the 85 per cent of the world's population living  outside either superpower would have  the most intense interest. The two su perpowers between  them have more  than 95 percent of the world's total  nuclear weapons arsenal. That means  that under present circumstances only  the superpowers could initiate a war  that would be destructive enough to  trigger a nuclear winter. So seven out  of eight human beings on Earth would  be  innocent bystanders,  condemned  through no  fault of  their own  to  suffer weeks of darkness, months of  cold and years of starvation and death.  If the nuclear winter thesis is correct,  and our highest scientific authority  calls it a ""clear possibility,"" that any  superpower initiation of nuclear war  for whatever reason would mean a dec laration of war on mankind every where. Nuclear winter not only would  end any hope of saving lives in Russia  and the United States through such  civil defense techniques as urban evac uation, it means that people innocent ly living in Switzerland and Norway, in  ",1985

320,1237,3,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, House  Resolution 85 provides  for consider ation of H.R. 1189, urgent supplemen tal appropriations for emergency agri cultural credit. As my colleagues are  aware, this is the second of two emer gency agricultural measures we have  considered on consecutive days. Yes terday we considered a measure  re ported from the Agricultural Commit tee. This rule provides for consider ation of another approach to this criti cal problem, reported from the Appro priations Committee.  This rule provides  that H.R. 1189  will  be  considered  in  the House.  Debate on the bill is limited to 1 hour,  and the time will be equally divided  and controlled by the chairman and  ranking minority member of the Com mittee on Appropriations. At the con clusion of debate on the bill, the previ ous questions shall be considered as  ordered on the bill. And finally, one  motion to recommit is provided by this  rule.  Mr. Speaker, the effect of this rule is  that no amendments will be in order  when  the bill  is  considered  in  the  House. As I have already noted, just  yesterday we considered a comprehen sive emergency agricultural credit bill  from the Agriculture Committee, the  authorizing committee  in the House  for  these  issues. That measure was  considered under an open  rule and  Members had a  full opportunity  to  off er amendments to that bill.  Today. we will be  considering  a  measure reported from the Appropria tions Committee. The appropriations  contained  in  this bill pertain  to a  single department and are primarily  provided for one purpose, to provide  funds for loan guarantees made by the  Farmers Home Administration. The  Rules Committee felt, therefore, that  in light of the extensive debate and  opportunity for amendments on the  measure considered yesterday, as well  as  the single-purpose nature of this  bill, that the membership should have  an opportunity to consider this meas ure as expeditiously as possible, with  an up or down vote. This rule will ac complish that objective.  Mr. Speaker, much was said yester day in the debate on the Agriculture  Committee bill, and I need not reiter ate the concern we all share for the  situation our farmers face. Suffice it  to say that the situation  is critical.  Time is of the essence if we are to pro vide  assistance before  the planting  season. It is imperative that the House  have an opportunity to work its will  on this emergency legislation.  H.R. 1189's primary objective is to  provide assistance through the Farm ers Home Administration in a program  that has proved very successful over  the years. The Appropriations Com mittee has recommended a supplemen tal commitment of $1 billion in guar anteed operating loans. I would also  like to note, Mr. Speaker, that these  guarantees have no immediate impact  on the budget or the deficit. The guar antees result in expenditures by the  Government only if and when a bor rower defaults on a guaranteed loan.  This bill also appropriates $17 mil lion  to provide  for salaries and ex penses of the Farmers Home Adminis tration. This funding will allow this  agency  to provide  the manpower  to  assess, on a case-by-case basis, which  borrowers qualify for a temporary de ferral  of principal  and  interest  in  order to forestall foreclosure.  Funds are also provided in H.R. 1189  for the Economic Research Service to  study the causes of losses suffered by  agricultural producers over the last 10  years. Finally, the committee directs  the Small Business Administration to  make  available  previously  appropri ated funds  in programs designed  to  make  loans,  restructure  debt  and  extend loan guarantees.

322,1250,3,Mr. LOWERY of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I would like to take this op portunity during our discussion of sup plemental famine relief to address the  behavior of  the Ethiopian Govern ment toward its suffering population.  While I commend my colleagues for  their statesmanship and compassion in  considering aid for  the hundreds of  thousands in danger of starvation in  Africa, there has been little mention  of the Ethiopian Government's failure  to effectively anticipate and amelio rate famine conditions in its own coun tryside.  For months, Colonel Mengistu and  the Dergue, Ethiopia's ruling organiza tion, blocked efforts of foreign report ers to bring this tragic story to the at tention of the outside world. In Sep tember 1984, a  large number of jour nalists were permitted into Ethiopia,  but they were confined to the capital  city of Addis Ababa. They were invited  to cover the glorious celebration of the  Communist regime's 10th anniversary,  not the mass starvation occurring in  the countryside. The celebration was  very extravagant and very expensive.  Estimates of the cost ranged as high  as $200 million. The British press re ported that $500,000 worth of whiskey  had been imported for the occasion.  The celebrants enjoyed a new $5 mil lion bronze statue of Lenin, in addition  to color television, another luxury the  Government  introduced at a cost of  millions of dollars.  All this at a  time when an Austra lian envoy who had been sent to deliv er food for the starving had to wait 8  days before he could obtain transpor tation to get the food on its way. Fur thermore,  three aid ships bound for  the Eritrean Province have had their  cargoes confiscated, including a drill ing rig for water.  As we  supply much-needed assist ance to Ethiopian famine victims, this  body must recognize that the Ethiopi an Government has not only failed to  assist  fully  in aiding starvation vic tims, but has actually hindered relief  efforts. Instead of diverting resources  toward the reclamation and rehabilita tion of its agrarian lands, it has chosen  to equip its 500,000-person military or ganization. To this end, I recently in troduced House Concurrent Resolu tion 43, a measure that criticizes the  Ethiopian Government for  its negli gence and  irresponsible behavior  in  the face of widespread hunger.  Mr. Chairman,  I  strongly support  the efforts of Congress  to help the  suffering going on in Africa, but the  United States cannot solve the prob lem alone. The Ethiopian Government  must not hinder relief efforts.  Mr. Chairman, a clear message must  be transmitted to the Government of  Ethiopia that the U.S. relief system is  not available for its individual and po litical disposal, and  that  those who  seek to assist famine victims will no  longer abide by further restrictions or  hindrances.

324,1250,3,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Chairman, I have  watched this debate with considerable  interest, and I have studied this bill. I  voted against the authorization, and I  will have to vote against the appro priation. I do so with great reluctance,  because I share the compassion and  the concern Members have for starva tion in the world.  This Nation has always responded,  and we reach out with the compassion  in our hearts to starving people, but  we must temper that with the disci pline of the mind. The people of Ethi opia are suffering from an oppressive  drought, but they are also suffering  from an oppressive regime, a Marxist  regime.  I  am confident  that  if we  extend this aid, it will be used by that  regime to solidify its efforts.  We have only limited resources that  we can use to relieve suffering in the  world, and we can use those resources,  in my estimation, better to help those  people who are fighting for their free dom in other parts of the world,  in  places like Afghanistan and Nicaragua  and even Cambodia that we have so  far not responded to.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate and I ap plaud the compassion that is displayed  on this floor, and I appreciate and ap plaud  the compassion of  this great  Nation as it does respond, but let us do  so in a way that will make a long-term  contribution to the health and safety  and the security and freedom of the  people of all the world.

326,1250,3,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of this critically important  piece of  legislation  to  address  the  Africa famine situation. My colleagues  and I have been working for several  months to determine what kind of as sistance  is  needed,  including  food,  medicines,  blankets,  transportation,  and other vitally important measures  to alleviate the terrible suffering.  I led a delegation sponsored by the  Speaker  to Ethiopia  last November.  One of the other principal sponsors of  this  legislation,  the gentlelady from  New Jersey [Mrs. RoUKEMA], who  is  the ranking minority member of the  Select Committee on Hunger,  joined  me on that trip. We witnessed thou sands of people who, for lack of food,  medicines,  shelter,  and other basic  supplies, were experiencing great suf fering. We also saw  the great work  being carried out by private voluntary  organizations  and  the Agency  for  International Development in provid ing food and other necessities. But the  need far outstrips even the generous  levels of aid already going to Ethiopia  and other African nations affected by  the drought.  In the past weeks, Mrs. RoUKEMA  and I have worked closely with the  other  principal  sponsors  of Africa  famine  legislation, Mr. WEISS, Mr.  WOLPE, and Mr. CONTE, on a measure  to meet pressing needs. We agreed  that legislation was needed to provide  at least 1.1 million metric tons of food  and transport for that food, and $175  million for disaster and refugee assist ance for the remainder of fiscal year  1985. The appropriations committee  added $225 million to establish a re serve fund to meet unanticipated food  aid needs for  the remainder of this  fiscal year and for the next fiscal year.  That is the legislation before you now.  It is critically  important that this  funding be approved now. The Agency  for  International Development  has  ",1985

328,1263,3,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would  like  to ask  the gentlewoman  from Nebraska CMrs. SMITH], my good  colleague, a couple of questions that I  have on the bill.  It appears that we are about to make  $1 billion in additional credit guaran tees, loan guarantees, available to the  people  in agriculture and  I  assume  that with the application of good lend ing practices that we can expect repay ment of this money.  ",1985
329,1263,3,Mrs.  SMITH  of  Nebraska.," Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",1985
330,1263,3,Mr. MARLENEE., I yield to the gen tlewoman from Nebraska.  ,1985
331,1263,3,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.,"  the gentleman for yielding.  The CBO has figured the cost on the  basis of 5 percent delinquency. That is  our Congressional Budget Office. And,  yes; the CBO estimates that the cost  of it will be $50 million over a 4-year  period, the cost of the $1 billion loan  guarantee. Of course, we do have $17  million additional for employing addi tional FHA personnel.  ",1985
332,1263,3,Mr. MARLENEE.," Well, we  know  that there is a credit crisis out there.  We foresaw that coming and we had  thank  I  urged the Farm Home Administration  to take some steps to alleviate that, to  try to moderate that impact when it  got here because we knew that when  this hit that, farm  land values were  going  to plunge dramatically. It ap pears to me that that $1 billion would  be money well  spent  rather  than  seeing a wave of  foreclosures  if we  could in fact restructure some of our  farm debt.  I also see that there is $17 million in  the bill to provide for review of farm  loans. I  think that the gentlewoman  from Nebraska also probably has expe rienced a very ineffective bureaucracy  within Farm Home Administration  simply because they did not and do  not have enough personnel to review  and service the applications that they  already have; is that correct?  ",1985
333,1263,3,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.,"  If the  gentleman will yield further, those are  the facts. The backlog of applications  is so serious that this program cannot  work unless we get additional help out  there. Already help has been  trans ferred by the national office of FHA,  some 2,000 people are being put into  the areas where the planting time is  coming  immediately and  they must  have additional help and this $17 mil lion is  to further augment the local  personnel that is essential.  ",1985
334,1263,3,Mr. MARLENEE., I  thank the gen tlewoman.  ,1985
335,1263,3,Mr. WHITTEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  5 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma [Mr. WATKINS].  ",1985
336,1263,3,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to commend  the chairman and  the  leaders of the Subcommittees on Agri culture and Appropriations for your  fast work to get this particular bill to  the floor.  I  think we all know that  time  is of essence out there on the  farmlands of this country.  This bill basically does three things.  One, it provides yes the $1 billion in  credit that is necessary for many of  our farmers to continue and also for  many of our lending institutions to be  able to stay with our farmers, because  it is that serious out there in the farm land and  the country  there where  many of our farm banks are going  under. We have had more bank clo sures  in Oklahoma  than  since  the  Great Depression.  The second  thing  this bill does  is  allow the $17 million to provide the  personnel to review farm loans.  I  think  this  also  indicates what  many of us know, there has got to be  some revamping in the USDA to make  it more efficient and more effective in  carrying out  the programs  for  the  farmer and also for rural development.  But Mr. Speaker, I want to commend  the chairman and address  the  third  phase and that is the phase that has  $500,000 in it to provide the dollars to  review the policies that we have con ducted in the past decade that have  not allowed us to meet the competitive  markets around the world.  The Secretary of Agriculture calls  on an agriculture policy and the Presi dent has concurred and has endorsed  what he calls  the  free market. Mr.  Speaker, I  think most of us who are  acquainted with the farmers and the  agriculture policies of  trying to pro vide international trade of those farm  products realize that we do not have a  free market system.  0 1450  But we need to be calling, yes, for  that fair market, because you do not  have a free market when other govern ments, other foreign countries, subsi dize their products, where other for eign countries actually give metric ton nage bonuses  if other countries will  purchase their products, and where we  have a free market, when other coun tries will do whatever is necessary to  subsidize that export of their product.  Mr. Chairman, I think we all realize  that our farmers, basically, have not  had a free market when they have fol lowed the advice of the Secretary of  Agriculture at a time when we made  our last basic good profit on the farm,  and that was back in 1972, 1973. When  the Secretary of Agriculture said, ""Go  out and plant fence row to fence row,''  our farmers responded and did what  our Government told them to do. And  then the markets were pulled out from  under them.  The same thing under the Nixon ad ministration when we had the embar go on soybeans and, yes, under our  own administration, when President  Jimmy  Carter  had  the  embargo  against the grain.  A lot of people out there in America  said,  ""Why  treat  the farmer differ ent?"" The farmer has not had a free  market. They have been,  really,  a  pawn of whatever Government policy  might come down the road. I question  our policies, as our chairman has said,  a policy that allows us to sell military  weaponry to 125 countries that we do  sell American surplus food. I question  whether that policy is going to lead to  the peace that we want around the  world if we are not willing to provide  the food but if we are willing to actu ally sell military weapons. I question  the policy, yes, that can claim credit  for getting inflation down but closes  their eyes  to  the deflation  in  land  values, the loss of land values. In my  State of Oklahoma, agricultural land  has dropped 30 percent  in value 3  years in a row, the first time since the  Great Depression,  and our  farmers  have not been able to go in, since they  have not made a profit, on one hand,  and since they have lost their equity,  on the other hand, they cannot go in  and refinance those loans and be able  to stay in business.

338,1276,3,Mr. SHUSTER.," It is my understand ing, and I would like to clarify for the  record with respect to the House posi tion, assuming we are successful in ob taining the passage of this bill today,  that it is absolutely clear to everyone  that we are totally committed to the  enactment of this clean 18-month ICE  with no  extraneous provisions  and  that this position of the House is not  negotiable with the other body. Is that  the gentleman's understanding?  ",1985
339,1276,3,Mr. HOW ARD.,"  If the gentleman  will yield, I think the gentleman is ab solutely correct.  As the gentleman knows, the Mem bers in this House, based on the major  legislation we passed last year, must  have 75 or 80 needed projects. If we  get into a conference with the other  body,  it is going  to be months. The  construction season will be over, we  will not have  the  roads built,  the  people will not get the jobs. I agree  with  the gentleman. This  is  it. We  hope  the other body will accede  to  what  they have been  talking about,  what the administration has been talk ing about, a clean ICE bill. Let us get  it past the other body, down to the  White House,  the money can be re leased, and we can start to get to work.  The gentleman is correct. Not negotia ble at all.  ",1985

I want to take this op portunity  to  thank  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania for his hard work  not only on this bill but on the Sur face Transportation Act that we did  not pass last time. The same with the  chairman, Chairman HOWARD,  who  has been very, very receptive to the  needs of the Members of this House. I  just want to spread upon the record  the fact that we have got the assur ance from both sides, from the chair man and also from the ranking minori ty Member, that you are going to pro ceed very expeditiously on the Surf ace  Transportation Act  that we did not  pass last year, put those demonstra tion projects  in there,  including the  Route 2 bypass.

343,1276,3,Mr. SHUSTER.," I would respond to  my friend that the transportation au thorization  legislation  for both  the  highways and transit expires in this  Congress. Therefore, we must bring to  the floor of this HoU$e major trans portation authorizing legislation, and  it would be my full expectation that it  would  be  patterned  after  the  bill  which  passed  overwhelmingly  last  June in this House and would include  those much needed projects, which in cludes the one that the gentleman is  ref erring to in Ohio. It is long overdue.  ",1985
344,1276,3,Mr. LA TT A.," Let me ask one second  question, and that is: About when can  we  expect  that  legislation  on  the  floor?  ",1985
345,1276,3,Mr. HOW ARD.,"  If the gentleman  will yield, I would like to say that, in  talking with  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania and the gentleman from  California, I would say within a matter  of just a couple of months, because ba sically we are talking about the same  bill  that  the House overwhelmingly  passed last June, and those projects  are just as important this year as they  were  last year. The only additional  thing we have to do is provide for the  extension of the authorization for sev eral years. But the hearings have been  held, the House has worked its will. So  it will not take very long at all, and I  believe on March 7  there will be a  brief hearing on this specific legisla tion  the gentleman  refers  to, next  week.  ",1985
346,1276,3,Mr. LATTA.," I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today  provides this body with the opportuni ty to halt the shutdown of interstate  highway construction now occurring  throughout the Nation.  H.R. 1251 releases 18 months of im portant  funding  for  interstate con struction,  substitute  highway  and  transit projects, and minimum alloca tion fund apportionments. It has the  support of the administration, which  proposed  similar  legislation,  and  indeed, I feel certain that most if not  all Members of  this and  the other  body understand the pressing need to  approve both the interstate cost esti mate and the interstate substitute cost  estimate.  But perhaps  the most  important  characteristic of H.R. 1251  is that it  does not contain a laundry list of pro gram changes and project authoriza tions. It is truly a ""clean"" ICE bill and  as such,  it  is,  in my  judgment,  the  surest means of getting the long-over due enactment of these critically im portant cost estimates.  There will be another time for con sideration of what are unquestionably  meritorious  highway  and  transit  projects. The Public Works and Trans portation Committee expects to take  up a major highway and transit bill in  this Congress, so the opportunity to  consider  projects  and  program  changes will certainly be available to  the Members of this body.  Drawing on the unfortunate experi ence of the last Congress in combining  ICE  approval with  comprehensive  highway legislation, it seems only pru dent that we choose the legislative ve hicle that will get the ICE and ISCE  approved at the earliest possible date.  That vehicle is H.R. 1251. Its enact ment will enable the Federal Highway  Administration to release some $7 bil lion  in  Interstate Highway System  money now being withheld from the  States. In short, it will once again put  State highway construction programs  back in operation, and surely that is  what we all want. Ohio will receive a  total of $238,015,000 from this legisla tion. Of  this  total, $110,099,000 will  come  through  the 85-percent mini mum allocation provision and a part or  all of this sum could be made available  for Ohio projects such as the much needed bypass on Route 2 near Huron,  OH, and for the completion of work on  this Route 2 in Ottawa County, OH.

348,1276,3,Mr. SHUSTER.," I yield to the gentle man from Pennsylvania.  Mr. WALKER, I  thank the gentle man for yielding.  Both the gentleman from Pennsyl vania CMr. SHUSTER] and the chairman  have discussed the clean ICE bill that  you bring to us.  Some of us are troubled by an article  that appeared in this morning's Wash ington Post that was labeled, ""$7 Bil lion Highway Bill Freed by House  Panel."" The subhead was, ""Measure  Guards Speaker's Project.""  Down in the article it makes it clear  that it is the feeling of at least this re porter that what we have before us  today is a bill that does protect one  particular project as a part of  the  clean ICE proposal, and that causes  some concern, and  I wonder  if we  could get an explanation as  to why  this one project seems  to have sur vived.

350,1289,3,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to bring  the attached  letter  to  Ethiopian President Mengistu to my  colleagues' attention.  I  recently returned from a  trip to  Ethiopia sponsored by World Vision  which included two nights at a feeding  camp at Alamata. The memories of  the thousands of starving people, the  squalid  conditions  of  the  feeding  camps and the faces of the individual  Ethiopians who begged me for help,  are unforgettable. These memories, as  well as discussions I had with private  voluntary organization workers  and  Ethiopians  there,  and  people  from  within the administration and private  voluntary groups after my return have  contributed to my concern about deliv ery of food to the northern region of  Ethiopia, which is expressed in the fol lowing letter.  Progress has been made in supplying  the Ethiopian people with food and I  especially commend the generosity of  the American people who have helped  finance the work of our private volun tary organizations in this effort. How ever,  supplies of adequate  food are  only part of  the problem. We must  engage in every possible effort to per suade  the Ethiopian Government  to  expand  the  avenues  for  assistance,  particularly in the northern region.  I am pleased that so many of my col leagues  have  joined  Congressman  ToNY HALL and me  in signing  this  letter  to President Mengistu urging  him to consider all available means of  expediting donations to the people of  Eritrea and Tigre and development of  a safe passage policy to ensure that  famine relief efforts reach all areas to  Ethiopia.  tamante, Douglas Applegate, Mary  Rose Oakar, Cardiss Collins, George E.

Some of us have had the opportunity to  visit your country recently; all of us have  read press reports or heard accounts from  volunteer relief workers who have returned  from Ethiopia concerning the desperate sit uation confronting your people.  We  are  especially  troubled  about  the  plight of  those  in  the northern  region  where relief agencies have been unable to  reach those in dire need of food and relief  supplies. While progress is being made to re spond to the overall crisis, we would respect fully urge you to take all possible measures  to provide food and relief supplies to the  starving people in portions of Eritrea and  Tigre.  We commend to your attention the cur rent efforts by the United States and inter national assistance organizations to provide  relief, and we encourage you to accept all  offers of assistance by international groups.  In addition, we would encourage your gov ernment to consider all available means of  expediting donations to the people of Eri trea  and Tigre,  including  transportation  across  international borders and develop ment of a safe passage policy to ensure that  famine relief efforts reach all areas of Ethi opia.  In light of the many starving people in  Eritrea and Tigre, it is our hope that famine  aid can be delivered to these areas notwith standing political considerations. Your at tention to our observations and concerns is  appreciated. We hope that our nations can  increase  their mutual cooperation  in  this  humanitarian undertaking.  Frank R. Wolf, Tony P.

351,1289,3,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, we are  aware  that  this  is Black History  Month, during which  time we com memorate the contribution of people  of the black race to the progress of  man and the perfection of civilization.  On Friday of  last week,  there ap peared in the newspaper USA Today a  list of heroic achievements by black  people.  I  include the list appearing in the  25th  issue  of  the newspaper USA  Today in the RECORD today for the edi fication of our Members following my  remarks:  THE ROLE OF BLACKS IN HISTORY  In 1492, Pedro Alonzo Nino navigated the  Nina, one of Christopher Columbus' ships  on his  first voyage  to discover  the New  World.  About 5,000 blacks served in the Continen tal Army during the American Revolution.  Chicago's first settler was Jean Baptiste  Point du Sable, a pioneer trader who arrived  there in 1779.  The third-rail system now used  in sub ways, an automatic air brake, and an incu bator are among the more than 50 inven tions patented by Granville T. Woods in the  1800's.  In 1872, P.B.S. Pinchback served as Louisi ana's governor after the incumbent was im peached.  Chicago's Dr. Daniel Hale Williams per formed the first succesful open-heart sur gery in 1893.  Harriet Ross Tubman led more than 300  slaves to freedom via the Underground Rail road of the 19th century.  Maggie Lena Walker was the first Ameri can woman to become a bank president in  1903.  Singer Marian Anderson, a world-reknown  contralto, sang on the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial on Easter Sunday, 1939,  after  being barred from making an appearance by  the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Blood plasma was discovered and first uti lized by Dr. Charles Drew in 1940.  In 1940, Hattie McDaniel was  the first  black to win an Oscar for her performance  in Gone With the Wind.  ",1985
352,1302,3,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Speaker,  in the  fiscal year 1986 budget proposals, we  once more are faced with the unpleas ant and, so far, seemingly impossible  task of reducing our Federal deficit.  And, once more, the proposals sug gest that we accomplish this, in part,  by penalizing  the very people who  keep this Government operating-the  1. 7 million Federal civil service em ployees.  I recognize the need for budget re straint, and I stand ready to support  logical,  reasonable  budget-reduction  proposals. But it is unconscionable to  lay this heavy burden on the backs of  the  loyal Federal employees, whose  pay already  lags alarmingly behind  comparable pay in the private sector.  Let us remember-a Federal employ ee is also a Federal taxpayer, and a  father or a mother, or someone just  getting started. A Federal employee  has to buy groceries, make the month ly mortgage or rent payments. And  the cumulative effect of limited and  delayed pay increases in recent years  is making it harder and harder to meet  those financial obligations.  Compelling these employees to take  a 5-percent pay cut is unfeeling and, to  me, unthinkable. The last time such  proposal was made  seriously was  during the Great Depression.  A recent study of comparability of  pay in the public sector and pay in the  private sector showed that our Federal  workers are making about 18-percent  less than their counterparts. In other  words,  they already are doing more  than their fair share of helping keep  the deficit down. To ask them to do  even more simply is not equitable.  One argument used  to rebutt  this  comparability gap is that Federal em ployees  traditionally have had such  superior health and retirement bene fits that such fringes more than bal anced the pay differential. That argu ment has not been valid for a number  of years,  as  the private sector has  caught up with the Federal Govern ment in the benefits packages offered  to employees.  Another argument  that has come  into vogue just in the last year or so is  that during the recent lean years of  the recession millions upon millions of  American workers, particularly those  in unions, had to agree to give-back in  cuts of pay and benefits, so the companies for which they worked could stay  healthy. This argument also is flawed.  If any of us thinks that these unions  did not exact a quid pro quo for the  concessions,  then  you  are misin formed. The unions left the bargain ing tables with packages that included  increased  job  protection.  In  1984,  three out of every four collective-bar gaining  agreements  included  provi sions to protect workers during tech nological  change, work  transfer or  plant closings. Some of  the agree ments  resulted  in  stock  ownership  plans for the employees.  It has been reported that in 1986 pri vate salary increases are expected to  average about 6.9 percent, as the eco nomic recovery continues and private  sector workers begin to reap more of  the rewards.  It is time to let our Federal employ ees  reap  rewards as well, and  they  would be ill-served if they are denied  them. Federal employees have been  denied far too long. They have seen  scheduled pay increases delayed, and  cost-of-living adjustments eliminated  or def erred.  Let me share an alarming statistic  with you. Since 1970, consumer prices  have  climbed  309  percent.  Private  sector workers, during those 15 years,  have seen their pay increase by 291  percent-almost a  break-even point.  But during that 15-year period, Feder al pay climbed only 222 percent-a loss  of  about  one-third  in  purchasing  power.  It is truly amazing that we still have  loyal, hard-working Federal employ ees. This Nation is blessed with dedi cated Federal workers, but Congress is  straining their patience by using the  Federal deficit, year after year, as an  excuse to give them marginal pay in creases.  I have stood on  the floor of  the  House in past years and predicted that  such shabby treatment of our Federal  employees would result in an exodus  of capable, highly skilled workers from  the Federal work force  into the pri vate sector. This is no longer a predic tion, it is a fact. Civil servants are leav ing Government service in large num bers. Top college graduates are being  discouraged from making civil service  a career.  We cannot seriously consider a 5percent pay cut on top of everything  else the Federal employees have had  to shoulder.  I hope the Congress will reject the  pay cut proposal overwhelmingly and  at an early time in the budget proc ess.e  e ",1985
353,1302,3,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I joined  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee in 1978 when I first came to  Congress. During  that  time  I  have  become increasingly aware of what a  tough job civil servants have, and also  what a good job they do.  In many ways, I consider myself old f ashioned. My values are those of an other era. I believe in the family, hard  work, and  in  treating fell ow human  beings with dignity and respect. I also  believe that we are fundamentally a  good country, and that we have a good  Government. When I was growing up,  public employees were considered civil  servants. I still view them that way.  Public  employees  do  serve  the  public.  I don't think they work any  less hard than their counterparts in  the private sector. I think that much  of the criticism that has been leveled  against Government employees recent ly has been unfair and unjustified. It  is the overreaction of individuals who  view public service as merely a tempo rary assignment and as a way to en hance themselves personally.  Cutbacks to well deserved retirement  programs. COLA's, and hard earned  salaries are not the way to insure that  our Government operates efficiently.  It is bad policy, and  it  is bad  for  morale of the many dedicated public  servants who make certain that this  country keeps on running-to borrow  a phrase  from  the Postal Service through rain, sleet, or snow.  Government employees are an easy  mark for this administration. Like the  poor and minorities, they don't have  the clout of other interest groups, but  I know that I and my colleagues on  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee, as well as many other Mem bers of this body realize just how im portant and how good a  job Govern ment workers do. We all depend on  them daily. Let's appreciate them, in stead of threatening them with unfair  and unrealistic budget cuts.e   Mr. DWYER of New  Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague,  Congressman STENY HOYER, for bring ing this special order to my attention.  I, too, am concerned about the admin istration proposals as they affect the  Federal work force and appreciate the  opportunity  to  speak out on  their  behalf.  As you are aware Mr. Speaker, Fed eral workers play a critical role in the  strength of our country. They are the  highly skilled and competent men and  women at the National Institutes of  Health who are performing invaluable  research; the people who make certain  that Social Security checks are paid  on time to our senior citizens, and the  dependable letter carriers. Like most  Americans,  the  Federal  employee  works hard and  tries  to make ends  meet.  The Reagan administration has once  again proposed a number of changes  to the civil service retirement system.  Among them are delaying the retire ment age,  imposing severe penalties  for early retirement and changing the  method for calculating annuities. Pri vate sector employers have recognized  ",1985
354,1315,3,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Connecticut CMr. McKIN NEY] is recognized for 30 minutes.  eMr. McKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, re cently the chairman of the Govern ment  Operations  Committee  on  Environment, Energy and Natural Re sources, Mr. SYNAR, asked GAO to re view certain aspects of the financial  viability of the Great Plains coal gasifi cation project. We have heard state ments  today  that  the Great Plains  project is being overfunded by the Syn thetic Fuels Corporation and that the  Federal Government is giving a wind fall to the owners of Great Plains.  To rebut those contentions I would  like  to quote a paragraph from  the  cover page of the GAO report:  According to GAO's assessment of SFC's  proposed assistance, a lower amount of as sistance could achieve the same results if  Great Plains' partners could fully use cer tain tax credits and  if energy prices and  other assumptions  remained  the same as  those SFC used in April 1984. Since April  1984,  however,  several  changes have oc curred,  such  as  a  continued  decline  in  energy prices. An August 1984 SFC analysis  indicates that the decline in energy prices  offset the effect of the increased tax credits.  Other changes have also occurred, but SFC  analyses subsequent to August 1984 showing  the impact of these changes were not avail able to GAO. If all changes since April 1984  were incorporated into GAO's analyses, the  results could be different.  Mr. Speaker,  the  implication  that  the owners of Great Plains will, as a  result of the prospective SFC financial  assistance agreement, earn a 54.5-per cent rate of return is so outrageous as  to be ludicrous on its face. This is par ticularly  so when  the GAO  report  itself,  from which  the statement  is  taken, indicates that, with respect to  Great Plains, such a computation  is  misleading, has little value, and is not  the way the project should be meas ured. GAO says:  We believe that Great Plains should not  be measured using the incremental rate of  return because that return excludes most  construction costs and attributes all future  profits to the latest incremental investment  made.  A light-hearted analogy might be to  picture three men straining to pick up  a car but they can't lift it. A fourth  man comes along, grabs a bumper, and  the car is lifted. Do we say how strong  that fourth man is because he lifted  the car? Of course not; obviously, he  ",1985
355,1328,3,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Speaker, I am  proud to join my colleagues as we com memorate Black History Month. This  is a time to reflect upon the past ac complishments of blacks and look for ward toward new challenges. It is also  a  time  to  remember Dr. Carter G.  Woodson and his efforts to establish a  period of observance for our history.  Dr. Woodson articulated the fact that  blacks have made significant contribu tions in the development of this coun try and should be recognized for it. He  feared that without a specific period  of observance, our contributions would  be obscured, belittled, or forgotten.  During the past month we have hon ored those persons who have made sig nificant contributions to our history,  such as Charles Drew who pioneered  research  in blood  transfusions  and  Percy Lavon Julian who was the first  to synthesize synthetic cortisone. We  honored  the  courageous  efforts of  Harriet Tubman and Sojouner Truth  to transport slaves North where they  could be free. We honored the musical  achievements of Duke Ellington and  Leontyne Price. These are but a few  examples of the thousands that docu ment the achievements of black histo ry makers of the past.  We also paid  tribute  to our most  recent historical achievements. After  years of trying, through perservance, a  public  law was passed which desig nates January 20, 1986 as the first ob servance of the Federal legal holiday  honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.;  Col. Guy Buford became  the  first  black astronaut  to  travel  in space;  blacks dominated the Olympic games,  highlighted by Carl Lewis tying Jesse  Owen's record of winning four gold  medals; and Jesse Jackson became a  credible black Presidential candidate  and a major force in the effort to in volve blacks and other minorities  in  the political process, amassing support  from a ""rainbow coalition.""  We have a lot to be proud of, howev er, there is much left undone. We have  not yet  reached social or economic  parity. Last year, 9.9 million black  Americans-nearly 36 percent of the  black population fell below the pover ty level. Black unemployment rose as  high as 16 percent, two to three times  that of white unemployment  levels.  Black higher educational institutions  are continually struggling for financial  security while bombarded with severe  budget cuts. The Supreme Court's un precedented interpretation of title IX  of  the 1972 Education Act Amend ments  in Grove City College versus  Bell,  which  undermines  Congress'  original intention to prohibit discrimi nation in federally funded educational  institutions has yet to be overturned.  So as we complete our observance of  Black History Month, we should renew  our pledge  to meet the challenge of  fighting  racial  injustice. We  should  also pledge to continue in our history  making quests and avail America of  our knowledge and skills. Ours is not  an easy road but it can be  traveled.  The wall placed before us is high, but  it can be climbed. Although discrimi nation is still existent today, even in  the highest echelons of our society we  will take heart in knowing that we will  strive for social and economic parity  until the battle is won.e  e ",1985
356,1328,3,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my  colleagues  in commemorating Black  History Month. This is a time for all  Americans to recognize the countless  contributions that blacks have made  to this country.  Blacks have contributed  to every  phase of American society. Dr. Daniel  Hale Williams performed the first suc cessful  open  heart  surgery.  Dr.  Charles Richard Drew developed tech niques for separating and preserving  blood and blood plasma. These tech niques were  responsible  for  saving  hundreds of thousands of lives during  World War II. Crispus Attucks was the  first patriot to die for freedom in the  Boston Massacre, which sparked the  American Revolutionary War. Garrett  A Morgan invented the gas mask and  the traffic light. George Washington  Carver developed more than 300 prod ucts from the peanut and 100 products  from the sweet potato.  The accomplishments of blacks  in  my district  range  from Joseph Cin que's in the 1800's to Florence Sinclair  Virtue's in the 1900's. Under the lead ership of Cinque, a successful mutiny  occurred  aboard  the Spanish  slave  ship  in  New  Haven's  harbor. To blacks in my community,  this mutiny symbolizes the centuries long struggle for freedom of blacks in  America. The late Mrs. Virtue, whose granddaughter Sandra Elaine Dixon  works in my Washington office, was a  dedicated community worker and an  outstanding human being. Mrs. Virtue  came  to New Haven  in  1917  and  worked  tirelessly  in  the community  until her death last year. Her most  noted work was with  the United  Church of Christ of which she was a  longstanding member.  In 1965 when  the church built a housing project it  named it after her in honor of her  dedication and outstanding work  in  the community.  My district observed Black History  Month through a wide variety of ac tivities. The 165th anniversary of the  United Church of Christ was observed  by a  special presentation  titled  the  ""Historical  Perspective  of Dixwell  Church"" at  the New Haven Colony  Historical Society.

357,1367,3,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, this year marks the 50th anniversa ry of the establishment of the social  security system which today provides  retirement and disability benefits  to  more than 36 million Americans.  The original Social Security Act of  1935 has been modified many  times  since its enactment, but the basic con cept  of  the  program  remains  un changed. American workers and their  employers pay taxes to the social secu rity  trust  funds  throughout  their  working lives, and upon retirement re ceive monthly  benefits  from  those  trust funds based on the amount they  contributed. Congress has been careful  throughout the years to ensure that  the social security trust funds remain  separate  from  the General Federal  Treasury accounts. In this way, it was  thought that social security benefits  would be insulated from periodic polit ical and budgetary pressures. Unf ortu nately, despite these efforts, our Na tion's  social security recipients have  all  too often been held hostage by  Congress.  Once again this year, there are some  in Congress who continue to suggest  that to reduce the Federal deficit, the  scheduled January 1986 Social Securi ty  cost-of-living  increase  should be  eliminated. A  resolution  I am  intro ducing  today expresses  the sense of  the Congress  that Members of  the  House and Senate refrain from any  consideration of  legislation  to elimi nate, postpone, or reduce Social Secu rity cost-of-living adjustments. As the  resolution states, many Social Security  recipients  rely on  these benefits as  their only source of income and the  cost-of-living  adjustments  as  their  only means to offset increased prices  for goods and services including food  and medical care. The resolution also  reaffirms the fact that the Social Se curity trust funds should not only con tinue  to operate  independent of the  General  Treasury  accounts,  but  should also be considered separate for  accounting purposes.  Congress created in 1939 a separate  trust fund for the Social Security Pro gram, which was not included with the  Federal  budget  submitted  by  the  President and considered by Congress.  The Federal budget at the time only  showed receipt and expenditures paid  into and out of the General Treasury  fund.  For the most part, the Social Securi ty trust fund has operated throughout  the program's history with a surplus  of funds. In an effort to capitalize on  4241  these  surpluses,  President  Johnson  began  in  1969  to  incorporate  the  Social Security trust fund into a uni fied Federal budget. Social  security  surpluses were used  in  this way  to  offset increasing Federal deficits.  Social Security was  intended  to be  an  autonomous,  self-supporting  system, funded through employee and  employer  contributions.  For  this  reason, I have steadfastly opposed any  changes  to  the Social Security Pro gram that were proposed not to pro vide for long-term stability of this pro gram, but to achieve short-term budg etary goals.  In an effort to eliminate the incen tive of those who falsely attempt to  reduce the Federal deficit through re ductions  in Social Security benefits,  Congress directed in the Social Securi ty Amendments  of  1983  that  the  Social Security trust funds once again  be  treated as a  totally separate ac count  of  the Federal Government.  Thus, Congress  reaffirmed  its belief  that the Social Security trust funds  should not be included with receipts,  expenditures, and the deficit or sur plus of  the General Treasury fund.  Because Congress delayed enactment  of this accounting change until 1993,  I'm introducting  legislation  today  to  accelerate the process so this account ing  change  becomes  effective  next  year.  Through the years, in addition to ef fecting budgetary savings at the ex pense of Social Security  recipients,  Congress  also  has  sought  political  gains from the Social Security system.  Prior to 1975, Social Security recipi ents were left to the whims of Con gress for their annual cost-of-living in creases. In those years when it was ad vantageous  for  the Congress,  large  cost-of-living increases were approved.  In other years,  there were no  in creases.  One of the first bills I introduced as  a newly elected Member of the 92d  Congress was  legislation  to establish  automatic annual Social Security cost of-living adjustments based on the rise  in  the Consumer Price  Index. Five  months later, Congress approved this  legislation and in 1975, the Social Se curity  Administration  began  the  annual payment of cost-of-living  in creases every year in which the Con sumer Price Index rose more than 3  percent.  The 3-percent level was established  because the Social Security Adminis tration advised Congress in 1972 that  at the time, it was prohibitively expen sive to calculate and administer bene fit increases less than 3 percent. Since  that  time,  however,  I  know,  as  a  member of  the Appropriations Sub committee which funds the Social Se curity Administration,  that  improve ments  in  the  agency's  computer  system have substantially reduced the  ",1985
358,1380,3,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am pleased  to cosponsor  legislation  which, in effect, continues our efforts  to revise and consolidate the laws re lated to vessel safety in title 46 of the  United States code. This particular  legislation will update those laws that  relate to a vessel's tonnage measure ment and load lines.  Before a vessel may be documented  as a vessel of  the United States,  it  must first be measured to determine  its gross and net tonnages. They are  used  in  the  collection  of  tonnage  taxes, drydocking,  towing and canal  fees, and a myriad of other charges.  These tonnages are also used as regu latory yardsticks when deciding which  navigational and maritime safety rules  the  vessels  and  their  crews must  comply with.  The major maritime nations have  based their tonnage rules on the 1854  British  rules of measurement, often  cited as the Moorsom system. These  rules for the major part have, through  the years, been so extensively  inter preted that tonnage uniformity never  really existed. In an effort to provide  international  uniformity,  the  U.S.  Coast Guard-representing the United  States at many  international meet ings-has been a  leading advocate of  reform. The result was  the develop ment of the International Convention  on Tonnage Measurement of Ships,  1969 at London, England. This conven tion was ratified by the President on  October 28, 1982, with the advice and  consent of the Senate. It entered into  force internationally on July 18, 1982,  and came  into effect  in  the United  States on February 10, 1983.  Vessels that engage in international  voyages are subject  to  this  tonnage  convention and are required to present  a valid tonnage convention certificate  when entering ports of other contract ing governments. The Coast Guard  with the help of the American Bureau  of Shipping has done an outstanding  job of remeasuring our vessels under  the provisions of the convention to fa cilitate  their operation without any  lost time.  The problem with this legislation in  the past has been its applicability to  the smaller, domestic vessels. They are  February 28, 1985  adversely aff ectd by the international  ~onnage criteria because it materially  mcreases their existing tonnage. This,  ~n turn, subjects them to higher and,  m most cases, unnecessary inspection  and manning standards. This problem  has now been resolved by providing a  chapter  entitled  ""Regulatory  Ton nage"" whose net effect is to continue  measurement of these smaller vessels  under existing  laws and regulations.  This, in turn, subjects them to existing  vessel inspection and manning require ments. However, many of these vessels  would still have to be measured under  the international standards if they are  operated in international trade.  This legislation will also enable the  Coast Guard to apply simplified vessel  measurement methods, in lieu of the  formal and more extensive procedures,  to self-propelled commercial vessels of  less than 79 feet that engage on inter national voyages as well as domestic  voyages. This is a broadening of the  Tonnage Measurement  Simplication  Act  that  I was  privileged  to  steer  through to enactment in 1980.  This  legislation will  also  update  those laws that require load lines to be  conspicuously  and  permanently  marked on each side of the vessel to  indicate  how  deep  the  vessel may  safely  load for the intended voyage.  These markings, in the form of a load  line disc and other lines used in con nection with the disc, are always locat ed amidships or at the vessel's mid length between perpendiculars. The  exact  location of  the disc  is deter mined by the rules of classification so cieties and  the Coast Guard which  take into consideration the details of  length,  breadth,  depth,  structural  strength and design, extent of super structure, sheer and round of beam,  and  other  vessel  characteristics  to  arrive at a  safe minimum free board  for various trading areas. This revision  and consolidation does not make any  substantial or controversial changes to  existing  law,  regulations,  or proce dures.  This is legislation that the adminis tration desires; it is legislation whose  basic  function  is  safety of  life and  property at sea; it is  legislation that  we can all support. I urge your support  and cosponsorship.e  DEFENSE POLICY PANEL  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 28, 1985  e ",1985

361,90,7,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, the  Communist Sandinista Government in  Nicaragua continues to talk peace but  make war against its  indigenous mi norities. As  reported  in yesterday's  New York  Times, Miskito  Indian  leader Brooklyn Rivera has recently  accused the Sandinistas of bad faith  and broken promises on their peace  negotiations.  ""The Sandinistas are  intransigent  and dishonest,"" Mr. Rivera said. ""How  can we expect Justice of this regime?""  The Times also notes that the Sandi nista war against the Miskitos has re sulted in the deaths of 800  Indians.  More  than 20,000  Indians have fled  Nicaragua for Honduras. Inside Nica ragua, the repression against the Indi ans continues. Mr. Rivera said  that  President Daniel Ortega has broken  his personal promise of October 1984  to  release  some 50  Indian political  prisoners  held  in Nicaraguan  jails.  Many other recent press reports have  confirmed  that  the Sandinistas are  also taking the Indians' homeland in  northern Nicaragua  and  turning  it  into a free-fire zone. The Indians are  being forcibly relocated, their villages  burned and bombed.  Mr. Speaker,  the Times character izes Mr. Rivera as the ""most moder ate"" Miskito leader. If he has finally  seen the Sandinistas' contempt for jus tice and negotiations, wouldn't this  Congress be foolish not  to see  like wise?  The Times article, which follows in  its entirety, is worthy of our attention,  for it illustrates that those who would  withdraw from Nicaragua, would like wise doom the Miskitos to repression.  A REBEL NICARAGUA INDIAN LEADER Is  PESSIMISTIC ON PEACE PROSPECTS  <By James LeMoyne)  SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, April 18.-A leader  of the Miskito Indian rebels says that after  six months of talks with Nicaraguan offi cials,  he has become  deeply pessimistic  about  the prospect of  reaching a  peace  agreement between  the  Indians and  the  Government.  The rebel, Brooklyn Rivera, is widely con sidered the most moderate leader of some  120,000 Miskito Indians, more than 40,000 of  whom are either in exile in Honduras or are  held in Government camps in Nicaragua.  In an interview here today, Mr. Rivera ac cused  the Sandinistas of bad  faith  and  broken promises. His heated comments were  in sharp contrast  to past statements  in  which he expressed optimism that negotia tions could bring positive results.  ""The Sandinistas are intransigent and dis honest,"" Mr. Rivera  said.  ""How can we  expect Justice of this regime?""  He added that he also suspected the mo tives of other Nicaraguan rebel groups who,  he conte:Qded, have failed to aid the Miski tos.  VISITED NICARAGUA IN OCTOBER  ""What I  think is that all nonindigenous  Nicaraguans want to use the tragedy of our  brothers for their own political ends,"" he  said.  Mr. Rivera, 32 years old, traveled to Nica ragua last October in what appeared to be  an effort to end the three-year-old war be tween the Sandinistas and the Indians. The  war  is believed  to have  resulted  in  the  deaths of at least 800 Indians.  Mr. Rivera heads Misurasata, one of two  rival Indians rebel groups that have fought  the Sandinistas  since  1981. More  than  20,000 Indians have fled to Honduras and  the Sandinista Government has forcibly re settled as many as 20,000 others in Govern ment camps deep inside Nicaragua.  Mr. Rivera said he began talks with the  Nicaraguan Government last October when  Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of  Massachusetts, arranged for him to meet  Daniel Ortega Saavedra,  the Nicaraguan  leader, at the United Nations. Mr. Rivera  said Mr. Ortega expressed eagerness to end  the conflict with the Miskitos, promised to  release 50 Indians Jailed in Nicaragua and  pledged land and a broad degree of political  autonomy for the Miskitos.  After the secret meeting, Mr. Rivera said,  he  spent 11  days  in Nicaragua, visiting  Indian refugee camps and villages on the  north Atlantic coast. He also  agreed  to  begin formal discussions with Nicaraguan  officials in Colombia, he added.  But Mr. Rivera said little progress had  been made after meetings  last December  and in March. The next session was sched uled to begin today in Mexico City.  Mr. Rivera said he was asking for political  autonomy, an end to attacks against Indian  villages, control of natural resources and re lease of prisoners.  The Government has not released Indian  prisoners, as Mr. Ortega had promised, Mr.  Rivera said, but has asked  instead for a  cease-fire and has offered him a place on a  five-member Government  commission  to  study the problems of the Indians.  ""To have fought for four years to have  one member on this commission,"" he said,  ""means the Indians will have to fight 500  years to gain their rights-.''  MR. PRESIDENT, CANCEL YOUR  VISIT TO THE GRAVES OF THE  SS  IN  BITBURG  CEMETERY  AND HONOR VICTORY OVER  EVIL  <Mr. DOWNEY of New York asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.>  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. Mr.  Speaker, a new and haunting name  has entered the American lexicon-it  is Bitburg. And it has become a symbol  of a wound that has yet to heal be cause buried within it lies the specter  of hatred which this Nation struggled  with such heroism to def eat.  .4mericans  remember what  they  were fighting against 40 years ago fascism, totalitarianism, and evil. And  they  remember  the  force  that em bodied  those  things-the Nazi  SS.  Americans  remember  that only  40  years ago, not a long time, this Nation  mobilized to def eat Nazi Germany and  the evil it stood for.  Sixteen million Americans served in  our Armed Forces. Over 1 million gave  their lives; 12 million Europeans were  consumed by the horror of the SS-run  Holocaust;  6 million of  them were  Jews. These memories are still young.  The President's intentions  to help  heal the wounds and bring our Nation  and the German nation to greater un derstanding are honorable and of the  greatest  importance. But I urge  the  President not to undo his good inten tions with a visit to the graves of the  SS.  For these graves hold the phantoms  of a  common enemy-an enemy we  share with all humanity. There, in the  graves where the SS lie, lie also the  dark forces that we are as members of  the community of mankind struggle to  defeat. There in the graves of the SS  lie hatred and violence and horror just as much our enemy as it is the  German people's.  And thus, to honor these graves of  our common enemy dishonors today's  Germany.  Those who gave  their lives  in the  struggle against the evil that the SS  stood  for,  those who  fell  innocent  victim to that evil and those who rec ognize the evil and still fight against it  today deserve the President's and our  Nation's honor.  Mr. President, cancel your visit  to  the graves of the SS in Bitburg Ceme tery and honor victory over evil.  0 1540  TASK FORCE ON INDIANA ELEC TION  ENDS  ITS  CAREER  IN  DISREPUTE  <Mr. FRENZEL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)

364,103,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.,"  gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, first of all  I  rise  in  strong  support  of  this  resolution  which in my judgment is the only con scionable thing to do. I do so recogniz ing the great respect I have for my col league  from Mississippi CMr. MONT GOMERY] and my colleague from New  York CMr. STRArrON].  Let me clarify several things.  It is first of all U.S. policy supported  by the administration, it is current law  that military and economic assistance  be denied to the Chilean Government  because of gross human rights viola tions. It was only a month ago that for  the first time the State Department  abstained on a loan in the Inter-Amer ican Development Bank for  further  loans because of these gross human  rights violations that are increasing.  President  Pinochet  scorns  the  United States. Several Members of  Congress met with him recently. I was  in  the last delegation  to meet with  him.  We asked him  in a positive  tone:  ""Will you lift the state of siege?"" Two  weeks later he increased it.  In addition to that we asked him to  ""Please try to make some semblance  of restoring an orderly process of de mocracy."" He laughed in our face.  Lastly we said, ""Could you please  stop that secret police of yours from  contintuing  to  torture  in your own  country?"" He laughed at us.  I  think what  this  resolution  is  simply doing is stating that the United  States recognizes that it has little le verage in Chile but the price in inter national public opinion simply to con duct naval exercises which I presently  support-I do not have any problem  with that-an occasional U .N. vote, is  not worth continuing to associate our selves with a regime that is repressive,  that  is not democratic. Tremendous  unrest is taking place there.  The democratic opposition in Chile  is forming, it is emerging. It does send  a  signal  to  our State Department  which in our judgment has not been as  strong in exercising this quiet diplo macy,  in telling Mr. Pinochet ""Your  human rights violations are objection able."" This is almost a restoration of a  policy that we have followed for many  years. We have denied them military  and economic assistance and now we  are abstaining. This resolution is not  that far from U.S. policy.  ",1985
365,103,7,Mr. STRATTON.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield to me?  ",1985
366,103,7,Mr. RICHARDSON., I yield to the  gentleman from New York.  ,1985
367,103,7,Mr.  STRATTON.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  would not the gentleman agree that  the Soviet Union is also a repressive  regime, as the gentleman from Calif or nia CMr. LANTosl, indicated with great  eloquence  just a  few moments ago?  Are we not associating ourselves with  them at Geneva?  ",1985
368,103,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Reclaiming my  time, if the gentleman will check the  bills that were introduced today, and I  think I wish to commend the gentle man from Pennsylvania CMr. YATRON]  for being consistent  in condemning  human rights violations on both the  left and the right. Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman CMr. STRArroNl will check  the bills introduced today, I have in troduced a bill condemning the human  rights violations of  the Sandinistas  and the Contras. I share the view of  my  colleague. What  I  am  simply  saying is that what is the price we are  paying for supporting Pinochet who  does not listen to us, who does not  care about us, who does not care about  our concerns? I do not see what the  price in international public opinion is  worth if we continue to support his re pressive practices.  This resolution simply restates U.S.  policy and has the United States come  out, the Congress of the United States,  on the side of democracy, on the side  of the end of human rights violations,  the end of the state of siege and the  death squads that have emerged since  March 31. Mr. Pinochet has dramati cally increased the repression in the  secret police. More men and women  have been tortured and killed in the  last 30 days than ever before.  The  time  to send Mr. Pinochet a  signal  from  the Congress  of  the  United States, a bipartisan signal, and  a  lot of Republicans are supporting  this bill, is now.  I urge support of this resolution.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of  House Concurrent Resolution 52.  Since the military coup of Septem ber 11, 1973, Chile has moved further  away from democracy under the Pino chet regime. During the first days of  the coup, thousands of persons were  rounded up at the national soccer sta dium. They were about to celebrate in dependence day. The systematic tor ture and murder which ensued will  never be forgotten. Unfortunately it  has not entirely ceased.  Just 2 weeks ago a 19-year-old stu dent died of gunshot wounds. A Chile an policeman shot him for the crime  of exercising what we take to be a fun damental civil right: The freedom of  expression. He was gunned down while  distributing leaflets critical of the Pin ochet regime. The use of torture by  police and security agents in Chile has  been well  documented  by  private  groups such as Amnesty International  and Americas Watch and by public  international  bodies  such  as  the  Human Rights Commission of the Or ganization of American States. Those  who protest this practice in Chile have  been subject to arrest and assassina tion by the Chilean police. Recently,  the Reverend Dennis O'Mara was ex pelled from Chile for peacefully pro testing the use of torture. Union mem bers, teachers, students, and the Chile an Commission of Human Rights have  been  the main  targets of shootings,  kidnapings and relegation by executive  order-or  to put  it clearly-internal  exile without a trial.  A new development  is  the appear ance for the first time of death squads  in Chile. On March 31, the bodies of a  teacher, a sociologist, and a painter  were found with their throats cut and  knife wounds throughout their bodies.  This event followed other kidnapings  and shootings by death squads. All the  victims were known to have expressed  opposition to the Pinochet regime.  On January 15, I wrote the Chilean  Embassy to express my concern about  the well-being of four national Indian  federation  leaders arrested during a  raid on Temuco by Chilean security  forces on January 3, 1985. I also ex pressed concern about the exile of 26  members of the Human Rights Com mission of Arika and Iquique. The U.S.  Embassy was able  to ascertain  that  the 26 were relegated for 90 days each  to small towns scattered throughout  Chile. Just 11 days ago, nine union  leaders were  banished  to  distant  towns. I ask my colleagues to imagine  life in Chile, where those who express  disagreement with  systematic viola tions of human rights are arrested or  disappear, are tortured and killed, and  others are banished.  There are elements of the situation  in Chile  that allow  for comparison  with the situation in the Philippines  and South Africa. In all three cases  the democratic forces,  the forces of  reform, are steadily eroded by general ized repression,  leaving less and less  room for a middle ground. The same  sort of constructive engagement has  failed in all three cases. I think that  the U.S. Embassy could be giving more  attention to the democratic forces in  Chile and provide more access to the  Embassy. I realize that it is difficult to  provide security to persons who want  to visit. Just 2 months ago, on Febru ary 21, a group of 30 women were ar rested in front of the U.S. Embassy as  they were trying to reach the distin guished  Ambassador  Langhorne  Motley,  to ask him  to  intervene  in  favor of the persons banished to Pisa gua.

371,116,7,The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,"  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Indiana?  There was no objection.  AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE  OFFERED BY  :MR. HAMILTON OF  INDIANA TO  THE  JOINT  RESOLUTION  OFFERED  BY  :MR.  BARNES OF MARYLAND   Strike out all after the resolving clause  and insert in lieu thereof the following:  SECTION 1. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR PEACE  IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  The Congress finds and declares the fol lowing:  < 1 > The United States desires peace  in  Nicaragua and throughout Central America.  United  States  policy  toward Nicaragua  should encourage all combatants to estab lish a ceasefire and come together in peace  negotiations in order to resolve the internal  Nicaraguan conflict, nurture democratic in stitutions  in  that country, and promote  peace and stability, as part of a regional set tlement throughout the Contadora process  or the Organization of American States.  (2) The  countries  of Cental America,  working  through  the Contadora process,  have agreed to 21 principles <set forth in the  Contador Document of Objective issued on  September 9, 1983) which provide an appro priate framework for achieving peace and  security in the region.  (3) Combatants on both sides of the con flict in Nicaragua have expressed in words  their goals for peace and democracy in Nica ragua and  throughout the region. United  States policy should be designed to encour age these goals,  including through the re sumption of bilateral  talks between  the  United States and Nicaragua.  (4) There are disturbing trends in Nicara gua's foreign and domestic policies, includ ing<A>  the Sandinista goverment's curtail ment of individual liberties, political expres sion, freedom of worship, and the independ ence of the media;  <B> the subordination of military, judicial,  and internal security functions to the ruling  political party;  <C>  the Sandinista  government's close  military ties with Cuba, the Soviet Union,  and its Warsaw Pact allies, and the continu ing military buildup that Nicaragua's neigh bors consider threatening; and  <D> the Sandinista government's efforts to  export its influence and ideology.  (5) The Congress will continue to monitor  developments  in Nicaragua  to determine  whether progress is being made to curtail  these disturbing trends. Such progress will  be a key element in congressional consider ation of future economic and security assist ance requirements in the region.  (6)  the Congress  determines  that  progress is being made toward peace and de velopment  of  domocratic  institutions  in  Nicaragua, consideration will be given to ini tiating a number of economic and develop ment programs,  including but not limited  If  to(A) trade concessions,  <B> Peace Corps programs,  <C> technical assistance,  <D> health services, and  <E> agricultural development.  <7> Should Nicaragua not address the con cerns described in paragraph (4), the United  States has several means  to address  this  challenge  to peace and  stab111ty  in  the  region,  including political, diplomatic, and  economic means.  In addition,  the United  States< A> should through appropriate regional  organizations, such as the Organization of  American States, seek to maintain multilat eral pressure on Nicaragua to address these  concerns;  <B> should, if called upon to do so, give se rious consideration to supporting any sanc tions adopted by such an organization; and  <C>  should  consider  the  imposition of  trade sanctions.  (8) In assessing whether or not progress is  being made toward achieving these goals,  the Congress will expect, within the context  of a regional settlement<A> the removal of foreign military advis ers from Nicaragua;  <B> the end to Sandinista support for in surgencies in other countries in the region,  including the cessation of military supplies  to the rebel forces fighting the democrat ically elected government in El Salvador;  <C> restoration of individual liberties, po litical expression, freedom of worship, and  the independence of the media; and  <D>  progress  toward  internal  reconcilia tion and a pluralistic democratic system.  <9> The Congress  is  deeply  concerned  about human rights violations by both the  Sandinista government and the armed oppo sition groups.  SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR MILITARY  OR PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS  IN  NICARAGUA.  The  prohibition  contained  in  section  8066(a) of the Departmnt of Defense Appro priations Act, 1985 <as contained in section  101 of Public Law 98-473) shall continue in  effect without regard to fiscal year until the  Congress enacts a Joint resolution repealing  that prohibition.  SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A  CONTADORA AGREEMENT AND  HU MANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR REFU GEES.  (a) IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTADORA AGREE  MENT.-During fiscal year 1985,  the Presi dent may allocate $4,000,000, which shall  remain available until expended, for pay ment  to  the Contadora Nations <Mexico,  Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela> for ex penses arising from implementation of an  agreement among the countries of Central  America based on the Contadora Document  of Objectives of September 9, 1983, includ ing peacekeeping, verification, and monitor ing systems.  (b) HUKANITARIAN AsSISTANCE POR REFtJ GEES.-During fiscal year 1985, the President  may make available up to $10,000,000 for  the provision of food, medicine, or other hu manitarian assistance for Nicaraguan refu gees who are outside of Nicaragua, regard less of whether they have been associated  with the groups opposing the Government  of Nicaragua by armed force. Such assist ance may be provided only  through  the  International Committee of the Red Cross  of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees, and only upon its determina tion  that such assistance  is necessary  to  meet humanitarian needs of those refugees.  To the maximum extent feasible, such as sistance should be provided to those organi zations in kind rather than in cash. Assist ance may not be provided under this subsec tion with the intent of provisioning combat  forces.  <c> WAIVER OF LAws.-Assistance under  this section may be provided notwithstand ing any other provision of law, except that  section 531<c> of the Foreign Assistance Act  of 1961  (prohibiting the use of funds for  military or paramilitary  purposes)  shall  apply  to any assistance under subsection  (b).  (d) SOURCE OF FuNDs.-Funds used pursu ant to this section shall be derived from the  funds appropriated to carry out chapter 1 of  part I <relatiang to development assistance>  of chapter 4 of part II <relating to the eco nomic support fund) of the Foreign Assist ance Act of 1961 or section 2(b) <relating to  the ""Migration and Refugee Assistance"" ac count> of section 2Cc> <relating to the Emer gency Refugee and Migration Assistance  Fund> of the Migration and Refugee Assist ance Act of 1962.  ",1985
372,129,7,Mr. THOMAS of California.," It seems  to me that one of the criteria that we  should have established early on and  we could have done that by interview ing county election officials, was the  condition  under which  the  ballots  were being held.  It seemed  to  this gentleman from  California that before we could write  any rules, we had to know the universe  over which we were dealing with in  writing  those  rules.  However,  it  seemed appropriate  to  the majority  that there was no need to interview  either the candidates or county elec tiond  officials  in  Indiana's Eighth  Congressional District or State elec tion officials. That seemingly it was  easier and in fact better to write rules  for  the recount without having any  firsthand knowledge of what is going  on.  Several phone calls were made and  the folks were in; they talked over the  phones for a few minutes. If they were  not, we passed on. What finally greet ed us out there was something that I  think sobered up a lot of people. That  is that it is easy to stand on the floor  of the House, as the majority leader  did, and make pious statements about  how unseemly the folks in Indiana's 15  counties of the Eighth Congressional  District  carried  on  their  activities.  When,  in  fact,  if you will examine  what the task force did, it was no more  unseemly than what went on election  day. Those folks knew the territpry;  they knew what they were doing, and  if you will compare election night re sults with  the  task force's so-called  final result, and understand that the  task force was going to count ballots  that were illegal and invalid under In diana law. That they did a remarkably  good job. As a matter of fact, they did  as good a job, if not better, than the  task force.  ",1985
373,129,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Is there anything in  the gentleman's experience that would  lead him to believe  that the  judges  and clerks in Indiana's Eighth District  were any more or less competent or in competent  than election  judges  all  over the United States, including the  gentleman's own district?    I yield to the gentleman for his re sponse.  ",1985
374,129,7,Mr. THOMAS of California.," I would  tell  the gentleman we  saw quite a  cross-section of individuals as we inter viewed them finally after we had es tablished the rules out in Indiana. I  would say that there were several of  them, one in particular that is as in51-059 0-86-5 (pt, 7)  competent as anybody's county clerk  anywhere in the United States.  There were others that were very  professional in the manner in which  they ran their county. I would say to  the gentleman that the names that I  read from the county clerk's office in  Greene County, Greene County hap pens to have a Mr. Al Inman as its  county clerk, interestingly enough, he  is a Democrat, and he signed an affida vit  in  terms of his ballot  security  which would be a model in terms of  the way in which those ballots were  treated.  Ballots which were invalid under In diana law were accorded maximum se curity and treated as any other valid  ballot. He was very proud of the way  in which he ran his clerk's operation  and very well he should have been.  Even the professional recount direc tor, Mr. Shumway, indicated that the  way in which ballots were handled in  certain counties afforded them equal  security.  D 2010  So what you have, I would say to the  gentleman  from Minnesota,  is what  you usually get when you examine a  cross-section of election officials and  county clerks, and that is, you found  some that were very, very competent,  you found some that were less compe tent, and you found one or two indi viduals that no one wants to pattern  as a role model.  But I would tell the gentleman from  Minnesota that it was a very typical  experience; that by and large those in dividuals offered an honest effort in  counting the votes, and by and large  they did as good a  job, if not better,  than most Members' counts in their  own districts.  ",1985
375,129,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Does the gentleman  have a comment on the recount team?  Were  they  in  a  position,  being 6  months in arrears, or 4 months, what ever  they were,  and having ballots  that had been picked over twice, were  they in any better position to evaluate  ballots, particularly from  the stand point of hanging  chads  on punch  cards, or of spoiled ballots, or of distin guishing marks to make decisions than  the judges and clerks on the spot on  election day were able  to make  the  same decisions?  ",1985
376,129,7,Mr. THOMAS of California.," If the  gentleman will yield further, I  think  we have to understand that the only  virgin  count  that occurred was,  of  course, the one that occurred election  night, and that without knowing that  it was going to a close election, those  individuals  engaged  in  a  counting  effort that I have to say was very com mendable. The decisions  they made  were reasonable and rational.  On the recount, we were now getting  the second rehash of the ballots, and  as  the gentleman well knows,  there  were a multiplicity of voting procedures in those counties, hence I would  assume the majority leader's concern  about confusion in the various coun ties. I am quite sure he was not privy  to the fact that in those 15 counties  they voted a combination of machine,  that is, lever-pulled ballots; they also  had punch-card ballots which operate  a machine which punches a hole in a  nonperf orated ballot;  they also had  punch-card ballots in which you poke  out a perforated spot; they also had  paper ballots. When you take a combi nation and mix those within a county,  you do have difficulty  in  terms of  trying  to be consistent because  the  ballots themselves are not consistent.  But after the recount night and the  bags were sacked again and then the  task force pulled them out and began  examining  the ballots,  I can assure  this gentleman that when you  take  something like a perforated card and  give it the treatment that it had, and  then you are required to make a deci sion is that particular chad, which is  the center of the punch that is sup posed to be out, is that hanging by two  threads or three threads? When you  get into that kind of a discussion based  upon the way some of these ballots  were handled, it gets to be a little lu dricrous in terms of voter intent.  ",1985
377,129,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," I thank the gentle man. I hope the gentleman can remain  a while, because I would like to ask  about  distinguishing  marks  and  spoiled ballots and ballot security and  antifraud  statutes which were  dis missed by the task force, but I would  like to yield now to my distinguished  colleague  from  New  York  CMr.  GILMAN].  I  thank the gentle ",1985
378,129,7,Mr. GILMAN.,"  man for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the  gentleman for arranging this time for  us  this evening to discuss  this very  critical issue and commend the gentle man from California CMr. THoMAsl for  his extensive effort in trying to bring  some order to this problem that really  goes to the very heart of our constitu tional process.  Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that in  the last 6 months, we have witnessed a  barrage of verbal volleyball over which  candidate is the winner of the election  in the Eighth Congressional District  of Indiana. Many of us have refrained  from commenting during  this  time,  since all of us are not experts on Indi ana election law, although I had some  misgivings over the treatment the mi nority would  receive during  the  re count process as directed by the House  task force.  Having reviewed all the pertinent in formation that has been made avail able to us, as well as discussing this  issue with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, I have come to the conclu sion  that  indeed  the voters of  the  ",1985
379,142,7,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  if  the gentleman will yield, does  that  presumptively prove that it was an im proper vote?  ",1985
380,142,7,Mr. LUNGREN.," No.  The next point that I would like to  make is that proceeding under those 2to-1 rule decisions, under the rules es tablished, the task force then failed to  follow the very rules that they had es tablished and they created an excep tion to those rules, when perhaps it is  by coincidence, i am not going to cast  aspersions  on  anybody's motivation  here, perhaps it was mere coincidence  that on those occasions when they set  aside the set of rules that they had es tablished overcoming Indiana law,  it  happened to go to the benefit of the  Democratic candidate.  Now, the point is that we have some where between 25 and 32 ballots that  are nonnotarized, nonwitnessed,  ab sentee ballots. Those remain in contro versy.  Similarly situated ballots were ac cepted as the vote took place and Mr.  Mccloskey finally, finally, finally got  a lead; but the ballots in the predomi nantly Republican  counties,  either  four or six counties, from which these  ballots came,  those ballots are not  being counted.  .  .  Additionally, we have I believe it is  at least 10, somewhere between 10 and  20 ballots cast by members of the mili tary in which the postmark was prior  to the date of the election, but because  of  the postal  service  they did not  arrive until after the election. They  are not being counted because under  Indiana law they would not be counted.    We  set  aside  Indiana  law under  other circumstances, but not here.  What are some of the things we set  aside under Indiana law? Characteris tics that are marked on ballots. People  say, ""Why worry about that?""  Because if you have any knowledge  of electoral procedure, one of the ways  you make sure that you do not have a  corruption of the system is that you  do not allow identifying marks. Why?  Because somebody can get paid to go  in and vote and how do  they make  sure they get paid? They make a char acteristic mark on the ballot and the  person who happens to be part of that  corruption sees it and makes sure they  are paid.  In one circumstance, we had three  such ballots that were counted for Mr.  McCloskey-three  such ballots  that  had identifying marks for Mr. McClos key that were allowed in, but one that  happened to be for Mr. Mcintyre that  had a number on its back, even though  there was a strong argument that the  number had been made by poll clerks  in counting ballots, not by the voter,  that was not counted.  One of  the very ballots  that was  counted  for Mr. Mccloskey  was  marked by the voter with a star that  Mr. Shumway,  the person  that was  hired by the task force to establish the  rules, had earlier used as an example  of the ballot with the distinguishing  mark  in  training  the GAO  recount  auditors not to count.  0 2000  So in the circumstances in which we  were confronted with the questions on  2-to-1 votes, on 2-to-1 votes on the task  force to decide whether the ballots in  question ought to be adopted, we lost.  We lost.  Now we have somewhere between 23  and 50 ballots that are still out there  and we have been told by the task  force they will not be counted because  they are substantially different. The  testimony, the testimony of the indi vidual who -was given the responsibil ity of establishing whether or not  there was security that was presented  around  those ballots;  that  is, were  those ballots secure  from  the  time  they were handed in until the  time  now, answer: yes to the question posed  to him in  this morning's task force  meeting. He said there was similar se curity with resp~ct to  those ballots  that the Democratic majority is refus ing to have counted as those ballots  that have been counted.  So the question is first of all you  have a man who has been certified as  the winner on election night. Then a  recount is called for by both sides, and  the result of that recount is that he  establishes a victory margin that is  well over eleven times as large. And  then you say no, no, that is not good  enough; we are going to set up rules.  And we have set the rules up and then  the rules are not even followed. There  ,-,  ",1985

Watching  the  proceedings  on my  office television a little bit ago, I no ticed we did get one Democrat out  here who participated in the exercise  and so on and who seems to have left  the floor since.  The Democrats seem strangely un willing to come out and engage in this  kind of debate.    PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  tempore. The  ",1985

383,155,7,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, there was  a reference by a colleague that maybe  I violated the rules of the House, and  suggested that maybe my words ought  to be taken down.

390,155,7,Mr. WALKER.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding because  this point  may well be going along with what the  gentleman from Florida was  just in quiring about. It does seem strange  that we do not have very many of the  Democrats  out  on  the  floor  this  evening def endingthe actions of the  task force. This was a task force cre ated by the majority side. They did it  on  a  purely  partisan  vote.  They  stacked a committee of the Congress,  the House Administration Committee,  and  then  further  stacked  the  task  force  itself, and now not seem very  willing to come to the floor to defend  the actions that turned out to be an  outrage.  It seems  to me  that we Dught  to  probably be hearing  from  some of  them because while many of us are  disturbed  enough  about what  has  taken place to show up on the floor  even at this late hour, the fact is that  we are not hearing very much from  the other side. Perhaps it is just inde fensible, what they have done.  ",1985
391,155,7,Mr. KOLBE., I yield to the gentle man from Minnesota.  ,1985
392,155,7,Mr. SIKORSKI.," I thank the gentle man for yielding. I do not absolutely  want to intrude upon your proceeding  this  evening,  although  two  points  should be made for the record, as long  as the issues were raised.  The first is that certain people are  not here in part because this matter  was raised and kept secret until very  late in the legislative day, and were  not given the lead time notification.  Second, that when people have at tempted to participate in these discus sions this evening, the time was with drawn from them; they were cut and  others. That is all I care today and I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1985
393,155,7,Mr. KOLBE., I thank the gentleman  for his comments. I would point out  that I do not know of any secrecy that  is involved in this. The special orders  for  tonight are promulgated at  the  same  time that they are every day;  there was nothing  that was  secret  about this.  I yield to the gentleman from Cali fornia.  ,1985
394,155,7,Mr. HUNTER.," I  man for yielding.  I would like to answer the gentle man's question because I have sched uled most of the people who are speak ing now and will speak later on to night. A member of  the Democrat  staff came over and' asked us shortly  after the Republican conference broke  up if we were planning an all-night  session, and one of our staff people  came over and said what should I tell  thank the gentle them, and I said you go back and tell  them we are going to plan an all-night  session and ask them if that is OK  with them.  In doing that also, several members  of the staff for the House came out  and asked me  if  in fact  there was  going to be an all-night session, and if  so, they needed to plan for it so that  they could be accommodated in there  schedules, and I said absolutely.  Then several people called up and  said can we tell the newspapers that  their is going to be an all-night session  and I said ""absolutely."" This was not a  secret session;  this was an idea that  was brought up during the Republican  session today, and we needed to get  enough people on board to see if we  could get enough people to make the  thing go. But once it went we did ex actly that.  I would  like  to hear Mr. PANETXA  give an explanation, and I hope it is a  better explanation than the one that  .hemade in the hearing in Indiana. So  I would welcome his participation. I  would welcome  the majority  leader,  Mr. WRIGHT, coming before the full  House and explaining to us how we  fulfilled his uniformity requirements  that he said we must impose on the  State of Indiana when we went there  and we counted absentee ballots until  the Democrats had a 4-point lead and  then we quit counting absentee bal lots.  So, let me just say to the gentleman  if he thinks there is some kind of a  surprise that has been sprung on the  world by us going on television and ap parently no Democrats knowing about  it for many, many hours, I would wel come the Democrat leadership to come  down here tomorrow morning and con front this issue and explain why they  had  to  impose  this uniformity  that  really was not very uniform on the  State of Indiana and on the people of  the district which elected Mr. Mcin tyre to a seat in the House of Repre sentatives.

403,168,7,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Thank you.  I have one basic question I would  like to really ask the opinion of my  colleagues that are here this morning.'  As we analyze this entire situation  from beginning up until our present  point  in time, we have seen what I  think we agree is an abuse of power.  Yet they are talking about gaining one  seat when  they already have many  more than the minority party holds.  In  the process of doing  this, and  looking at the films and the tapes of  the hearings, and so on, the question  comes  to mind, do  those  that are  behind  this  feel  that , the American  public is so stupid and ignorant that  they cannot see that rules are being  changed, that this is an unfair situa tion, and in fact then jeopardizing the  integrity of their party?

410,168,7,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Thank you.  I gue8s  the thing that bothers me  about this entire situation beyond the  constitutional things which we are all  very, very concerned with and out raged, what is the motive? Why has  thi~ been done? I see no logic in.it. If I  were a Democrat,  I would be very  nervous,  because  it would  reflect  poorly on my party.  We already have a majority on that  side of the aisle. What is the motive? I  guess that is the question I would like  to ask my colleagues here, if t.pey have  an opinion, and anyone from the other  side of the aisle who would wish to  off er something on that line.  ",1985
411,168,7,Mr. BATEMAN.," I thank the gentle man for the question, because it is of  the essence of really why I came here  at. this late hour, or early hour, de pending upon your perspective, to try  and address.  I am in very large, virtually total,  agreement with my colleagues on my  side of the aisle who have spoken to  this question this evening.  The one exception to my agreement  is  those of us who have  taken  the  point of view that we should assume  that when  the  last chapter of  this  novel has been written, the conclusion  will be that the election in the Eighth  Congressional District of Indiana has  been stolen from us. I fear that may  happen;  I will  not  assume  it will  happen.  I  cannot  believe  that men  and  wome1~ of good conscience, properly  informed as to what the genuine issues  involving this disputed or so-called dis puted election are, will violate  the  oath they have taken to uphold and  def end the Constitution of the United  States,  that  they will  violate  that  c9mity that has been so often spoken  of this evening and which is the very  essence of the legislative process.  I have served in the' House but one  term before this present one. I have  served in a  legislative body prior to  coming here for 15 years. I can add to  that somewhat unique experienc~ of  having served as a member of a major ity party, a chairman, of a committee; I  have served also as a member of the  minority party, having chang~d politi cal parties.  The  legislative  process  does  not  function 'well; it will not serve any con stituency, except through recourse to  simple, elementary notions of comity  between Members of the body, which ever side of the aisle they happen to  sit.  I will not assume that my colleagues  on this side of the aisle will have cal lous  disregard when  this  ultimate  question comes before us.  .  If I may,  I would  like  to address  what I have perceived to be how we  got to where we are and the question  of, are we on this side of the right  aisle correct when we say that there is  a potential of an outrage being contin ued? Because if you approach it with out having prejudged it, we need to re inforce, we need to persuade why we  are saying that there is an outrage.  The gentleman from Iowa pointed  out' that this seat cannot be vital to  the majority party in the context of  assuring  their status as a majority  party. They have it whether or not  Mr. Mccloskey is seated or Mr. Mcin tyre.  0 0150  By the same token, why is it so im portant to us on the Republican side  of the aisle who is seated? We will no't  be  the majority.  It will  not  give  anyone any more favorable committee  assignments or any other prerogatives.  Why, then, are we saying outrage? We  are saying outrage because on January  3, 1985, the House was importuned, or  the majority thereof, by the leader ship of the majority party to disregard  the long-standing precedents of  this  House,  that anyone who had been  elected and certified as having been so  elected by the appropriate electoral of ficials of their State was entitled to be  seated, even if there were a question  that he should be seated, having been  certified conditional upon the recount  or whatever  legal procedures would  then be had.  Mr. Mcintyre on January 3,  had been certified as the winner. He  had been certified as the winner by  the same official and under the same  law as all other members of the Indi ana delegation who presented them selves in this body on that date for  purposes of taking the oath of office.  Whether or not they were Democratic  members of that delegation or Repub lican members of that delegation;, they  were all here and certified by the same  authority under the same law.  We were  told,  however,  by  the  Democratic  leadership,  don't worry  about the fact that the precedents say  you seat at least conditionally anyone  certified as being validly elected be1985  ",1985
412,181,7,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," I thank the  gentleman for his comments. I agree  that one vote is important, and it is  very  important  that we uphold  the  Constitution of the United States and  make sure that every individual's vote  does count.  We have talked much tonight about  the historic date of January 3, when  all of us, except one, were sworn in to  be new Members of the 99th Congress.  I would like to mention another date  that occurred approximately 3 weeks  later, and that was the date that our  great  President,  President  Ronald  Reagan, was sworn in for his second  term  as President of  these United  States.  As the Speaker will recall and the  Members in the Chamber will recall,  because of the inclement weather, the  ceremony was held in the great rotun da of this Capitol. I was able to actual ly stand in the rotunda as the Presi dent was sworn in, and I noticed that  the  great American  actor,  Jimmy  Stewart, stood behind the President of  the United States as he took the oath  of office. That made me recollect on  some of Mr. Stewart's great roles in  the movies. One of his greatest roles  was in a movie called ""Mr. Smith Goes  to Washington.""  Jimmy  Stew.art  played Mr. -Smith in that movie and,  as we will all recall, he came from the  great State of Indiana, I believe, and  he was nominated-not elected, but  nominated-to take the place of a Sel) ator  from  Indiana-not a Congress man, not a Representative, but a Senator-and he was nominated because he  was kind of a  rube, and  the great  powers of that day in that movie felt  that he could be manipulated and con troled and would not be a concern.  They were trying to get a dam called  the Willow Creek Dam on Willow  Creek  passed,  and  they  felt  that  Jimmy Stewart would not be a prob lem for  them. So Mr. Smith got to  come  to Washington. They  tried  to  show him the monuments and fix him  up with a young lady as a girlfriend,  but Mr. Smith got it into his head that  he wanted to so something for Amer ica,  that he wanted  to build,  as  I  recall, a boys ranch on Willow Creek,  and that didn't set too well with the  powers  that be. They  tied  to break  him. They tried to grind him into the  dirt. They did everything that they  could, but Jimmy Steward would not  stand for it.  He made an ultimatum to himself  that if he was the only Senator in the  U.S. Senate who  really cared about  what was right for America, he was  going to stop that dam and not let it  come about. As we all know,  in the  movie, he won. He won because he did  what he thought was right.  We are not trying to stop a dam on  Willow Creek, and we are not trying to  build a boys ranch for the boys of In diana. But I think all of the Members  of this body, of the U.S. Congress, the  House of Representatives, do want to  emulate that great actor Jimmy Stew art in that movie and do what is right  for this country.  We are in a situation here where, in  the Eighth Congressional District of  Indiana, we have to make a decision.  Since January 3, the decision has been  that the apparent winner, the certified  winner,  shall not  be  seated. That  man's name  is Rick Mcintyre. The  second  recount  that has  just been  completed-although completed is not  the right verb-that has just been pre maturely  ended,  I  guess, would be  more correct. At this point in time, the  person who has the lead is Mr. Frank  .Mccloskey. At some point in time, this  week or next week, there is going to be  a motion made for the majority party,  more than likely, that Mr. Mccloskey  should be declared  the winner and  should be seated.  I don't happen to think that that is  right. I don't think it is right for many  reasons. In the short hour that I have,  I am not going to be able to go into all  those. I brought part of my file with  me, and I could just begin to pull doc uments out and read from those, but I  don't think  that would get  to  the  heart of  the matter. But  the main  reason I do not think it would be right  for this body to seat Mr. Mccloskey is  because, in fact, he has not won the  election. He has not won the election  because  the  lead  that he now has  come about through a set of circum stances and a set of recount procedures that are nowhere codified in the  law,  in  any  election  rules  in  this  United States of America.  How has he gotten to the point that  he has, as it .stands tonight, a four vote lead? First, they had to discount  the election, the original election on  November 6. The majority leader of  the body, the distinguished Congress man from my home State of Texas,  Mr. WRIGHT, said on January 3 that  they could not vote to seat Mr. Mcin tyre because the procedures involved  in his election had not been timely,  had not been regular, had not been  fair. We could pose the same question  this  evening. The  procedures  that  haye been involved in the latest re count in Indiana have not been timely,  they certainly have not been regular,  and they most certainly have not been  fair. So we ,have ,gotten to the point  where we have got to decide what to  do about this.  As one Member of this body,,! would  say that the thing that we should do  would be to move immediately to seat  the certified winner, which  is Mr.  Mcintyre, and then, if we really are se rious about this and want to conduct  an investigation, let us conduct an in vestigation. We have not conducted an  investigation yet. In the Federal re count  that  has  been  prematurely  ended, what we have done is s~t up an  entirely new procedure. But there was  no investigation of the original elec tion, and there was no investigation of  the recount. They came up with a new  set of procedures  and began  from  there. So let us seat Mr. Mcintyre to morrow, and then if we want to get to  the bottom of it, let us conduct the in vestigation.  That is not just my opinion. There  have been numerous editorials  that  relate to that. Some of the editorial  boards  in  this  country  that  have  stated Mr. Mcintyre should be seJ1,ted  are  the Wall Street Journal  three  times, the New York Times, the Wash ington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the  New  York  Post,  the Washington  Times, the Dallas Morning News, the  Houston Post, the Detroit News twice,  the Hpuston . Chronicle,  the Arizona  Republic, the Baltimore Sun, the Chi cago Sun Times, the Richmond Times  Dispatch,  the Denver Post. That  is  just a few. In the State of Indiana we  have  the  Indianapolis  Star,  the  Muncie Star, the Evansville Press, the  Madison Courier,  the Goshen News,  and the Franklin Daily J oumal. And  that is just a few. To my knowledge,  there has been no editorial support, at  most, maybe one newspaper..:....1 believe  a newspaper in Louisville came out  and said that perhaps Mr. Mccloskey  should be seated. I am not s'ijre aboU'.t  that, but I think that iS the only one.  So we have this vast range of opinion  stating that Mr. Mcintyre should be  seated .  .  '  .  l  .  ",1985

424,207,7,Mrs. BENTLEY.," That's right, sir.  Now, you mentioned that the Wash ington Post suddenly may see the light  a little bit. I would like to point out  that  yesterday  the Baltimore Sun  wrote an editorial on  this and  the  headline is ""Vote Again in Indiana.""  And down  in-it relates a  little bit  about what had happened and it says  ""Don't be surprised if the task force  and then the House vote to seat Mr.  Mccloskey. A study of contested elec tions shows that in only 47 of 547 in stances has the minority party's candi date been awarded a contested House  seat. Seating either candidate would  be a mistake. We say that even though  the  task  force count may be more  exact than the earlier one, but most  people in and out of Indiana probably  believe this count reflects bias if not  fraud.""  Mr. McKINNEY. You bring up an  interesting-by  the way,  I congratu late the Baltimore paper. I had lost  hope in it for a while, too. Even the  New York Times has joined the fray.  You know, it makes an old man like  myself  feel  that  there  is  life after  death  and  there  is maybe  some  common sense spreading through the  press of the United States-it is a won derful thought.  What you are saying is really inter esting. Doesn't it degrade your seat,  doesn't it degrade the people of Mary land in your district, doesn't it degrade  my seat and the people in the Fourth  Congressional District of Connecticut  when in fact we tum to the American  people and say, ""See all  these seats  here; some of those seats are not prop erly filled.""  Perhaps there is a chance that some one in one of those seats shouldn't be  here.  Shouldn't we, as the House of the  people, be turning around and saying  in fact that we want to make sure? We  fuss  and  fume about one man/one  vote.  In  reapportionment we worry  about half a percentage point, a half a  percentage point,  and here we  are  turning  around  and  saying  that  nobody can  really  figure out what  happened in this election but because  I own this place I am going to seat  that person. Isn't that what we are  doing here, really?  ",1985
425,207,7,Mrs. BENTLEY.," You touched on a  very sensitive point, and that is, what  do the people of America think of this  body,  and you know we have-this  body has gone  through  some very  questionable periods in recent years,  and there have been charges out in  the public of corruption and of fraud  and of  just everything disreputable.  And, you know, there were times when  I was running people said, ""What do  you want to go there for? I mean those  people aren't honest.""  Now, I didn't believe it. I didn't be lieve it. I ran again because I wanted  to come here because I felt that this  House, this body, was something that  was going to lead the country properly  and that we were going  to do good  things for  the people,  just like you  said.

439,233,7,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, Evelyn  Waugh wrote,  ""It  is  better  to be  narrow-minded than to have no mind,  to hold  limited and  rigid principles  than none at all. . . . There are still  things  which  are worth  fighting  against.""  For Alan Paton, author of the classic  ""Cry the Beloved Country,"" disinvest ment  is one of  those  things worth  fighting against. For those supporters  of disinvestment, both  liberals and  conservatives, both sincere and trendy  resume-builders, I am pleased to share  Alan Paton's nightmare as reprinted  in the Religion & Society Report of  February 1985.  ALAN PATON'S NIGHTMARE ABOUT SOUTH  AFRICAN DISINVESTMENT  Anglican bishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel  Peace Prize laureate, makes no secret of his  support for disinvestment. The idea of disinIn  has  vestment is that the withdrawal of U.S. cor porations and capital would bring effective  pressure to bear upon Pretoria and under mine the odious system of apartheid. The  disinvestment  campaign  in  recent  months gained momentum in this country,  erupting in Congress, state and municipal  governments, universities and, most success full, in some churches. Alan Paton, author  of the classic Cry the Beloved Country and  other writings against apartheid, thinks dis investment would be very bad for the Black  people of South Africa.  the Sunday  Times <Johannesburg> he politely took ex ception  to Bishop Tutu's views and was  roundly criticized by some readers, includ ing a Dr. Villa-Vicencio. We offer Alan  Paton's  response,  again  in  the Sunday  Times, not because it is necessarily the de finitive world on disinvestment, but because  it reflects considerations that may be  ig nored by activists here who, wanting to do  something about South Africa, may end up  doing anything, including things that grave ly  injure  the people  they want  to help.  Herewith Alan Paton's ""nightmare"":  ""I read that Dr. Villa-Vicencio, who has in  the past often thought I was right, thinks  now that I am wrong in passing moral Judg ment on those who advocate disinvestment.  He thinks I take a simplistic view of the  whole issue.  It seems that I have also misunderstood  the parable of the sheep and the goats. I un derstood Jesus to mean that if you denied a  hungry man food and a thirsty man drink  you were doing something very wrong.  I deduced from that parable, which I take  very seriously, that it would be wrong to ad vocate any course that would put a man out  of a Job.  To be simplistic is bad enough, but to fall  off one's pedestal makes it worse. One is  hurt, not only in one's body, but also  in  one's pride. There is only one sensible thing  to do in these circumstances, and that is to  go to bed. So I went to bed to sleep, per chance to dream ...  They came to see me,  these Americans,  full of righteousness. They flattered me too.  They told me my name was well known in  America, almost as well known as Gary  Player and Chris Barnard,  and now of  course Zola Budd and Bishop Tutu.  They told me the Americans had great re spect for my moral Judgments and that if I  came out for disinvestment, it would be a  certairi winner.  They asked me to become the president of  the World Disinvestment Campaign. They  also told me that if anyone was put out of a  Job, it wouldn't be me. I told them I had cer tain moral doubts, but they explained that I  was being simplistic.  One should bear in mind that Jesus was  talking about meat and drink, not about  Jobs. After much moral wrestling I accepted  the argument. No one can be more convinc ing than an American.  Also I must admit that I have some moral  weaknesses-one is vanity and the other is  money.  When  it was  announced, with a great  blowing of  trumpets,  that I had become  president of the World Disinvestment Cam paign, my life changed overnight.  Mr. Archimedes, who hadn't spoken to me  for years, came up to Botha's Hill to tell me  that I was now the hero of Africa. Professor  F sent me a telegram saying that I had at  last atoned for praising the Israelis for res cuing their hostages from the clutches of  IdiAmin.  Mr. R who had venerated me when he was  young and had ceased to venerate me when  8771  I said that PW was astute, telephoned to  say that he now venerated me again. Chief  B rang up in a fury and said that I had de stroyed a friendship of nearly 40 years and  that he would never speak to me again.  Cables of congratulations poured in from  America, Canada, Britain, Sweden and other  countries. Alas, I lost most of my capitalist  friends, but one must pay a price for taking  a stand.  I travelled all over the world. I was wel comed  on  campuses which would  have  shouted me down a year before. It was nice  to come in out of the cold.  Then came the great day. Representatives  of America, Canada, Britain, France, West  Germany, Holland and Scandinavian coun tries met in London and declared for total  disinvestment <except perhaps for a strate gic mineral or two>. Mrs. Archimedes came  up to tell me I was the hero of the whole  Black world.  Disinvestment began to bite. Port Eliza beth and East London became dead cities.  Even in a quiet place like Botha's Hill there  were daily Black queues for food and Jobs.  I must confess I didn't like passing them.  Many of the people of the Valley of a Thou sand Hills were my friends, but some grew  very cold to me.  It was a great shock to me to hear over  the radio that a mob had burned the build ings of  the Valley Foundation and  the  Church of the Paracelete to the ground.  I  telephoned the Rev John Ndlovu, and  told him that he had my prayers. He said to  me, we don't want your prayers, we want  Jobs.  Mr. Archimedes, who knows I often go to  the Church of the Paraclete, came up to  condole with me. He told me one must pay a  price for making a stand.  There is unrest in the Valley, in Botha's  Hill and Hillcreast and Kloof and Westville.  I find that I spend more and more time in  my study. I pull down the blinds. I find that  I feel better when the blinds are down.  But Julia comes to tell me that there are  Black women wanting to see me. She brings  their leader into my study, a tall woman for  these parts, a tall woman carrying a child  and dressed in black.  She looks like a sculpture of the Sorrow of  the World. She gives me the child and I see  it is dead.  '-Why do you give this to me?'  'Because it is yours.'  '-How can it be mine? I have never seen  you before.'  'You took its life, therefore it is yours.'  She goes out of the study and calls to me.  She points to the waiting women.  '-They will bring you their children too.'  When  the police have  taken away  the  body of the child I come to a decision. I get  into my car, my new bullet-proof car, and I  drive  to Pinetown and I buy something I  have never bought before. It is a gun.  I go home and go into my study with the  drawn blinds. There, surrounded by all the  hundreds of books and papers that I wrote  for the World Disinvestment Campaign, I  shoot myself to death.  How could I do such a thing? How could I  bring such a noble life to such an ignoble  end? How could I commit such a deadly sin?  I am filled with an agony of remorse. The  burden of it is intolerable. I wish only to die.  But ... what am I talking about? Am I  not dead already? No I am not! The whole  thing is an unspeakable dream. I am full of  Joy to realise that I never had anything to  do with any campaign for disinvestment.  ",1985
440,246,7,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  introduced  legisla tion, titled the Student Loan Collec tion  Improvement Amendments  of  1985. The purpose of this legislation is  to reduce defaults and improve collec tions within the National Direct Stu dent Loan CNDSLl  and Guaranteed  Student Loan CGSLl Programs, au thorized under the Higher Education  Act.  Over the past 20 years, the NDSL  and GSL Programs have provided bil lions of dollars in student loans, open ing the door to educational opportuni ty for millions of students. Most stu dent  borrowers  have  honored  the  terms of  their loans and have paid  them back in full or are currently in  active repayment.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  April 22, 1985  in  However,  the default  rate  the  NDSL Program currently stands at  14.9 percent with $1.044 billion in de faults. The GSL Program carries a de fault rate of 4.8 percent with $1.1 bil lion in defaults; $2.3 billion is a signifi cant sum. Every effort should be made  to recover  these funds and put the  money back where  it belongs-into  new student aid.  The Department of Education has  requested that statutory changes be  made to the Higher Education Act to  help  improve  the  collection  effort.  These changes would strengthen pro visions under current law to aid the  Department,  postsecondary  institu tions, and State guarantee agencies in  their collection efforts.  The bill I am introducing on behalf  of the administration would help im prove collection efforts in the follow ing ways:  First,  loan checks would .be made  payable to both the borrower and the  postsecondary  institution-except  in  cases of parent borrowers.  Second,  NDSL  defaults  would  become liable for a certain amount of  the costs borne by the Federal Gov ernment  in  trying  to collect on de faulted loans.  Third, State guarantee agencies  in  the GSL Program would be required  to report borrower default status in formation to consumer credit bureaus,  currently, the Department of Educa tion has this authority but the State  guarantee agencies now handle  the  bulk of student loans.  Fourth, responsibility for the collec tions of defaulted NDSL's would be  transferred from the postsecondary in stitution to the Department of Educa tion  instances where  institutions  have  a  consistently poor collection  record.  Fifth, the Federal statute of limita tions-6 years-would be applied  to  GSL and NDSL defaults and recover ies  of  overpayments  on other  aid  whenever  an  otherwise  prevailing  State statute provides a shorter time  on the student's liability.  Sixth,  eligibility  requirements  for  Federal student aid would be broad ened to provide that any student in de fault on a loan or owing a refund on a  grant would not be eligible for further  Federal aid. Current law applies this  limitation to students applying for aid  at an institution at which they are al ready in default or owe a refund, but  does not prevent students in default  from applying for aid at other schools.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor  this much-needed set of reforms to our  student loan programs. We are work ing to preserve Federal student aid.  However,  in  light  of  our  current  budget deficit and the severe funding  crisis educational programs are experi encing,  these programs cannot, and  should not, be abused. Please Join me  in helping to keep student aid both eq uitable and economic.e  in  DR. EDGAR NELSON HONORED  HON.

441,246,7,Mr. CHAPPIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to a truly great  man, Dr. Edgar Nelson. On May 4,  1985, Dr. Nelson will be retiring as  pastor of the First United Methodist  Church in Yuba City, CA, after some  43 years in the ministry.  To the people of the Yuba/Sutter  area, Dr. Nelson has been the embodi ment of Christian goodwill and char ity. Through his  tireless efforts, he  has been able to touch the lives of lit erally thousands of people all over the  world, as well as in his own communi ty.  Dr. Nelson started out as an associ ate pastor at Pioneer Memorial United  Methodist Church in Oakland in 1943.  In subsequent years he served congre gations at Del Ray United Methodist  Church,  Sonora United Methodist  Church, St. Paul's United Methodist  Church  in San Jose,  and  the Mill  Valley United Methodist Church. In  1961 he was appointed senior minister  to  the Yuba City United Methodist  Church where he has remained.  Among his many accomplishments,  Dr. Nelson was one of the original sup porters of the Faith Christian School,  a nondenominational Christian school  serving the Yuba-Sutter area. He has  been  a  long-time  supporter of  the  Asbury Seminary and has served, for  over 40 years, as dean of Redwood  Christian Park. Dr. Nelson has also  dedicated his efforts to the California  Council on Alcohol Problems and has  been a noted spokesman on a variety  of social problems in California.  One of Dr. Nelson's major priorities  has always been missions. His leader ship has helped the congregation of  the Yuba City United Methodist  Church to greatly increase their par ticipation in mission work. His mission  work has taken him all over the world  and gained him the respect and admi ration of many missionaries including  Dr. Frank Laubach, a leader in world  literacy work, Bishop Washow Pickett  of India and Bishop Ralph Dodge of  Africa.  Mr. Speaker, one of the most impres sive things about Dr. Nelson is that,  despite all of his accomplishments, he  still sees himself as first and foremost  a pastor. One of his favorite passages  of scripture, Psalm 37:4, clearly ex presses the nature of this man. ""De light thyself also in the Lord; and he  shall give  thee  the desires of  thine  heart; ... ""  To Dr. Nelson I can only say thank  you. He has truly shown himself to be  a man who delights himself  in  the  Lord and has never been ashamed of  ",1985
442,259,7,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  bring  to  the attention of my  col leagues in the U.S. House of Repre sentatives  the  dedication  of  the  Founders' Wall of the Samuel and Lu cille Lemberg Building of the Central  Queens Young Men's  and Young  Women's Hebrew Association. This  joyous ceremony will  take place on  April 28, 1985.  The  modern  Lemberg  Building  opened in 1982, and is an impressive  addition to the Central Queens YM/  YWHA  facilities.  To  commemorate  this occasion, the Y has commissioned  Joseph Dzindshkashvili,  the  famous  Soviet Georgian artist, sculptor, and  designer,  to design a unique plaque,  which will be permanently displayed  in the Lemberg Building.  Mr. Speaker, this occasion is a proud  one  for  the Central Queens YM/  YWHA  and  for  the entire Queens  County community, which  it serves.  The Hebrew Association's Center has  made a tremendous contribution to all  of us, and has enriched our lives  in  countless ways.  The Center draws neighbors, fami lies,  and  friends  together  through  many educational and athletic activi ties.  Its programs  reach out  to all  members of our community, concen trating on many of our special needs.  The YM/YWHA's after-school  day  care is designed to provide an atmos phere of safety, guidance, and love for  children whose  parents work  past  school hours. The lectures and recre ational activities for seniors at the Y  are an important part of the lives of  many elderly citizens interested in art,  current events, and  fellowship with  their peers and neighbors. In addition,  the facility sponsors a  summer day  camp for mentally disabled youngsters  that enables them to share in the fun  and relaxation of summer that all chil dren enjoy.  8797  Mr. Speaker,  the broad  range of  services and programs offered by the  Central Queens YM/YWHA, and its  special attention to the community's  real needs, have made an invaluable  contribution to the quality of life in  Queens County.  Today, when  career opportunities  cause many adults and  families  to  move away from their friends and rel atives, this Center in Central Queens  provides an especially valuable serv ice-by giving us a means to make new  friends, share the interests and activi ties of our neighbors, learn about our  community,  and  take  part  in  its  warmth and fellowship.  Mr. Speaker, I would  like to com mend the center's outstanding officers  for their dedication to enriching the  Queens community: President Jeffrey  S. Aaron, vice presidents Michael Barr  and Howard L. Kleiger,  Secretary  Allen Fagin, Chairman of the Board  Julius Leventhal, honorary Presidents  George Kossoy, Harry Leventhal, and  Herman M. Metz, and all of its fine di rectors.

451,324,7,Mr. DENTON.," A  recent extended  visit by two Brigham Young Universi ty students to refugee camps in Costa  Rica and Honduras yielded similar re sults, which  they have publlshed.  I  shall ask unanimous consent that a  copy of their rePort also appear in the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks. Their interviews, however, also  provide  a  picture-not  so different  from that presented by the Permanent  Commission on Human Rights in Nica ragua-of Sandlnlsta human  rights  violations, which conflicts with  the  picture painted by Americas Watch  and by the Brody report, the latter  the  subject of  today's Wall Street  Journal article.  The Brody report is noteworthy be cause it was the brainchild of Reichler  and Applebaum, the law firm that rep resents  the Sandlnlsta  government  here in the United States, because its  authors were given material SUPPort  and transportation by the Sandlnlstas  during their stay in Nicaragua; and be cause  they admitted that local offi cials and health workers, more than  likely party members in good standing  or Sandlnlsta sympathizers, were a pri mary aid in helping to locate witnesses  to alleged Contra atrocities.  The result was a conclusion that the  Contras regularly and systematically  violate human rights. To date, I have  determined that at least three, per haps four, incidents mentioned in the  Brody  report were  not  accurately  characterized. The most blatant exam ple was the Brody report's description  of the December 1983 exodus of 2,000  Mlskltos to Honduras as a massive kld naping by MISURA, an Indian Contra  force. That event was widely reported  in the press, the American-born priests  who  voluntarlly  accompanied  the  flight asserted that the departure was  voluntary, and an independent  jour nalist who filmed  the entire exodus  says the Francia Slrpe residents were  packed and  ready  to go with  the  MISURA forces when they arrived.  I urge my colleagues to talk with  leaders or members of the Nicaraguan  armed resistance. I am convinced that  you wlll find them worthy of U.S. sup port and committed to ideals that are  similar to those found in our own Con stitution. The FDN, ARDE, MISURA,  and MISURASATA are not reaction ary organizations and are not engaged  in an effort to replace the Sandlnlsta  revolution with Somozismo.  Each fighter with the FDN ls given a  pocket-size ""Blue and White Book,""  which outlines  the principles UPon  which its struggle ls based. I quote for  a moment from that book:  Democracy ls the true power of the people  to elect and be elected. And it only exists  when periodic elections, free and universal  are practiced. Social Justice ls the goal of  any process of democratization in the free  world, because political democracy  the  basis of economic democracy,  ls  And finally.  FDN means enforcement of human rights:  above all, man, and the respect for human  rights, because where man ls not respected  as an individual being man ls not respected  either as a social being.  I  ask unanimous  consent  that a  translation of the FDN's ""Blue and  White Book"" appear  in the RECORD  f ollowlng my statement.  The PRFBIDINO OFFICER. With out objection, it ls so ordered.  <See exhibit 3.)  ",1985
452,324,7,Mr. DENTON.,"  I  conclude my  re marks with a few observations about  the myth  that  the Sandlnlstas are  wllllng to enter into good-faith negoti ations for peace.  Over  the weekend, Daniel Ortega  suggested that Nicaragua could only  find peace if the Reagan admlnlstration halts ""terrorist aggression"" by  U.S.-backed  insurgents and  resumes  direct  negotiations with Managua.  Given the confusion that ls the result  of much of the media rePorting on  Nicaragua, it may not be readily ap parent to the Congress or the Ameri can public, but the United States has  not provided assistance to the Contras  in almost a year. In May 1984, because  of a stalemate between the House and  the Senate, the Congress approved no  funds for the anti-Sandlnlsta forces.  The $14 million that was approved in  October and which ls the subject of  today's debate could not be spent.  Under Congressional pressure,  the  U.S. Government has met Sandlnlsta  demands. We have sent no money or  material support to the Contras, and  we entered into direct bilateral negoti ations at Manzanillo. I submit to you  that these actions led to no improve ment for the people of Nicaragua, nor  did they produce a reduction in Nica raguan efforts to extend Communlst  influence and control in Central Amer ica.  Harassment of the Catholic Church  and other  religious groups has  in creased, particularly since the fraudu lent November election to ratify and  consolidate FSLN Political authority.  Between September and October 1984,  a Catholic father was framed by State  Security and arrested on charges of  counterrevolutionary activity. Shortly  thereafter,  10  foreign-born  priests  were expelled from the country. These  priests  worked  under  Archbishop  Obando y Bravo in Managua and were  particularly effective  in helping  the  Poor and the youth.  Shortly after  the November elec tions, a document slipped through the  censors  and was  publlshed  in La  Prensa, perhaps a deliberate sllp  to  spread intlmldation. The document di rected the civil defense committees to  begin compiling the f ollowlng informa tion on religious groups: Location of  chapels, religious denomination of the  congregation, names and addresses of  leaders, description of cars and other  means of transportation used by lead ers, evaluation of political attitudes of  leaders, description of personal habits  or vices of leaders, description of the  size and nature of religious gatherings,  license numbers and descriptions of  cars of people attending services from  outside  the neighborhood,  and  the  source of funding for the church.  Between January and March 1985,  Fellx Rosales, director of the Nicara guan National Council of Evangellcal  Pastors, and Jimmy Hassan, the head  of Campus Crusade in Nicaragua, were  both summoned to appear before the  Managua Regional Committee of the  Sandinista  Revolution,  which  chaired by  Interior Minister Tomas  Borge. They were required to respond  is  ",1985
453,350,7,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, this  debate represents, I believe, a classic  and historic collision between what  might be called short-term and long term foreign policy considerations. Un fortunately, in some respects it seems  as  though  the short-term consider ations are presently winning. I see the  policy dilemma revolving around the  following factors:  First, if we  judge the character of  the Nicaraguan revolution precipitate ly and formulate our policies on that  basis, are we going to be prepared to  bear the consequences later if we are  wrong now? Do we defer our historic  commitment  to  the sanctity of  the  rule of international law to sustain the  momentum of this policy, of which the  $14 million has become but a symbol?  Do we work from  the premise that  peace  is possible or that war,  in all  likelihood, is necessary?  If we render a  judgment now that  the Sandinistas are beyond the point  of no return, we invite a self-fulfilltng  prophecy.  If we convince ourselves and  the  American public that Nicaragua is in  fact a certifiable arm of the Soviet  Union's foreign policy apparatus and a  threat to vital U.S. interests, we had  better know exactly what we are talk ing about, because under that assump tion, if a military defeat of the Con tras becomes inevitable, our obligatory  response will also be inevitable.  What we do or do not do today af fects the unfolding caricature of the  Nicaraguan regime. Make no mistake  about  it. Our  responsibility  is  im mense, because the mark we make on  that caricature  through our actions  today will  go  far  in  determining  whether it will be necessary to send  American troops to war tomorrow. No  society could sustain, without paying a  price in judgment, the siege mentality  which  the Nicaraguan people have  been forced to bear under the present  circumstances-fighting a war against  a dictatorship one day, only to defend  themselves against attack the next.  Mr. President, there are many valid  arguments that point to danger in the  Sandanista  regime,  their  immense  military buildup being one of them.  And I concur in the viewpoint that we  should be concerned and act accord ingly. But I speak now only of the psy chological impact that uninterrupted  war has on a society and a people. We  may never have  the opportunity  to  help  the Nicaraguan people  if they  become so used to war that they are  rendered incapable of functioning any  other way.  To the extent that this caricat.ure of  a society is still unfolding, opportunities to change it which we fail to em brace, opportunities that are before us  today,  ready  to be  tested, virtually  guarantee that our most sinister suspi cions will be validated.  So everyone here who talks of a ""to talitarian Marxist  Leninist  Soviet  beachhead"" in Nicaragua had better  know exactly what he or she is talking  about, because if a majority of us are  convinced of that now and act accord ingly, we are going to have it, as sure  as we are going to have to stop it one  day in order to save face.  I am not saying people are right or  wrong on this assumption. I am only  saying that we had better be careful  before we  cross  that  xenophobic  threshold. We are all cynical to some  degree, and I suppose we have a right  to be. But there are untested opportu nities which exist right now-they are  out  there-opportunities which  are  not receiving the attention they de serve. We are not taking them serious ly and yet we have no idea whether  they deserve to be taken seriously or  not because we have not really ex plored the possibilities.  The Nicaraguan Government is talk ing today about lifting press censor ship. They are talking about amnesty.  They have already announced a quali tative  freeze on  the  importation of  arms.  I have no illusions, but I do have  fear,  fear  that we have become so  jaded already, liberal and conservative,  Democrat and Republican, so obsessed  with the symbolism and the question  of who will win and who will be the  victor and who will be the loser in this  situation that the political smoke will  clear tonight and those opportunities  for forward movement will have gone  up in smoke right along with it.  Finally,  the  Sandinistas may  at  times seem like petty thugs but we are  surely becoming world class outlaws  ourselves. And as long as we stand in  defiance of  the  jurisdiction of  the  International Court of Justice, and  the Charter of  the United Nations,  glaring omissions in this debate, we de serve what we get according to the law  of the jungle.  We have embraced the law of the  jungle to the disgrace of our ideals and  the delight of our enemies as a pre ferred method of operation.  Congress sent a clear message that it  will not finance the mining of harbors  but it has not made clear during this  important juncture in the formulation  of policy that the rule of the interna tional law is every bit as relevant to  determining  the parameters of our  policy as our refusal to tolerate an other Cuba in Central America.  When we boycott international juris prudence over the mining of a harbor  because the verdict is predictable, we  invite  the Ayatollah Khomeini  to  mine the Strait of Hormuz, and when  ",1985

455,389,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," I would like to com ment on the bill, Mr. President, and I  thank the Senator from Washington  for his courtesy.  I call my colleagues' attention to a  new effort just starting at the Depart ment of Commerce-an effort to pro vide high-quality translations of Japa nese technical documents. I strongly  support this new initiative and believe  that it should be expanded and widely  publicized.  In recent months, we have rightly  called attention to the barriers that  Japan has erected to many American  products. But  if we are  to become  more competitive with Japan, we must  also get our own house in order.  Among other  things,  that means  learning more about Japan and gain ing more access to their technology.  The Japanese Government and Japa nese companies work very hard at  lea.ming American  technology  and  taking advantage of it. They send stu dents to our universities, and exten sively review our technical literature.  We should do  the same  thing. We  should study  their new  technology,  learn from it, and use it as they use  ours.  Yet until very recently we have done  little to translate key documents from  Japan's extensive technical literature.  Companies have not done much trans lation, because they lack the resources  and incentives to translate most infor mation. The Government has done  very little in this area, despite the poto American compa tential benefits  nies.  Now, however, the National Bureau  of Standards has begun a small pro gram to translate Japanese technical  documents, as well as some potentially  useful Soviet materials. I believe that  this effort deserves  strong congres sional support, and I  for one would  like to see it expanded and the results  widely distributed to American compa nies. For a small investment, we could  gain access to a great deal of valuable  information.  Mr. President, we must learn to com pete more effectively in the new inter national environment that confronts  us. This translation effort is a small  but very valuable step in the right di rection.  ",1985
456,389,7,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  I  associate  myself  with  Senator  BAucus' remarks. As my colleagues  may know, I studied the Japanese lan guage and I majored in Asian studies  while in college, and I still maintain a  deep interest in the area.  I  know  from personal experience  that Japanese is a very difficult lan guage to learn. Yet we cannot expect  to succeed in Asian business, or learn  as much from the Japanese as they  learn from us, unless we improve our  language abilities. One useful step in  this direction is to translate more of  their  technical  literature and make  that information available to Ameri can companies. As we all know, Japan  no  longer simply  imitates American  science and technology. They are now  world-class researchers and innovators  in their own right. They study our lit erature and use that information to  improve their products. We must do  more to gain access to their literature.  For that reason, I agree wholeheart edly with the Senator from Montana,  and if I understand the position of the  distinguished Senator from Washing ton, he shares my interest and Senator  BAUCUS'  interest  in  this  important  area.  ",1985
457,389,7,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I do  share their interest in this subject. I  am pleased that the National Bureau  of Standards is taking steps in this di rection, and I urge and expect  the  Commerce Department  to  continue  these efforts.

The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The Senator  from West Virginia CMr.  BYBDl, for Mr. Gou:, proposes an amend ment numbered 32.  ",1985
459,389,7,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed  with.  The PRF.sIDING OFFICER. With out objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  In section 2, insert ""(a)"" immediately after  ""Sec. 2."", and add the following at the end:  ""Cb> Notwithstanding any other provision  of this Act, of the total amount authorized  under subsection<~> of this section, $50,000  Is authorized only for the purpose of assist ing the creation and maintenance of data  bases on structural failures."".  ",1985
460,389,7,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, I am of fering an amendment to this bill to  create a central repository for infor mation on structural failures in this  country.  Before my election to the Senate I  served  in the House of Representa tives as chairman of the Science and  Technology Subcommittee on Investi gations and Oversight. In that capac ity  I held several hearings on  the  problem of  structural  failures  and  building collapses around the country.  My colleagues may recall  the great  human suffering and economic  loss  that resulted from such catastrophes  as the collapse of the walkway at the  Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel in  1981 and the failure of the Hartford  Civic Center's roof in 1978.  One conclusion drawn  from  those  hearings is that there is a great need  for some sort of central data bank for  information  on  structural  failures.  Witness after witness  testified  that  many future structural failures could  be avoided if information on past fail ures was readily available. Although  the causes of failures are often investi gated by private parties  involved  in  them, much too frequently the previ ous  information  gathered  through  these investigations is kept in private  hands or even prevented from being  made public because of  settlement  agreements in lawsuits. The only in formation  that  is  available  to  the  public is not organized in a compre hensive fashion to maximize its utility.  As a result, many errors that led to  failures are repeated in other projects.  The purpose of my amendment is to  ensure that the data that is public is  organized in a readily accessible fash ion. Information that is gathered by  the National Bureau of Standards  through its investigations or which is  provided by private sources will be  compiled into one central repository.  Access to this information will enable  parties in the future to avoid the mis takes that have caused failures in the  past.  The program that my amendment  initiates is a very modest one in light  of the gravity of the problem it is de signed  to address. The amendment  simply creates a  technical assistance  function for the National Bureau of  Standards and is in no way intended to  establish a regulatory entity. I believe  that it is a good effort and will be of  ",1985
461,415,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I have  been honored to address this chamber  on numerous occasions on the issue of  abortion. When I have been fortunate  enough to have those opportunities, I  have attempted  to present my colleagues with the most compelling facts  and insights available to me on this  crucial topic. You have heard me ex press the view that abortion generally  is the immoral practice of terminating  the lives of innocent unborn babies,  and you have heard me suppart this  belief with facts. I have listened to my  colleagues  state  their positions  on  abortion as well. However, it is wise for  the Senate to hear opinions and view points of people who do not serve in  this body; indeed it pays us to listen to  those we represent.  In that spirit, Mr. President, I would  like to share with my colleagues here a  speech which was recently delivered  by Elder Russell M. Nelson, a member  of The Council of Twelve  of  the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints. I have found that the opinions  of members of the clergy are often  among  the  most  reasoned  and  thoughtful views that we can consider.  The thoughts with which our religious  leaders provide us are views which are  sufficiently  independent  from  the  heated debate of  the Senate. They  also off er us  the moral perspective  which we must keep  in mind even  when we address the most temporal  matters. Elder Nelson's remarks are no  exception to this. In his speech he lu cidly expresses the horrors of abortion  and refutes, both factually and ethi cally, the primary arguments abortion  advocates have relied on for years.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  in the Senate to read Elder Nelson's  address. After  they do so  they will  know many of the compelling reasons  why America must end abortion, a  practice which has cost 161h mllllon  lives since 1973 and which has denied  the  precious  gift  of  life  to  4,000  unborn babies since this time yester day.  The address follows:  RZVDDCJ: FOR Lin: GENERAL COIU'ERDCJ:,  APRIL 6, 1985  <Russell M. Nelson>  Unitedly, we thank the Almighty for the  wondrous prolongation of the life of Elder  Bruce R. McConkle, enabling him to preach  that Powerful sermon. Our gratitude Is pro found!  I pray for the Splrlt of the Lord to help  me communicate his mind and will on a very  vital and sensitive subject. I apologize for  the use of words repugnant to me and ill  suited to this hallowed pulpit. I do so only  for clarity of communication regarding rev erence for human life.  As sons and daughters of God, we cherish  life as a gift from him.  A heavy toll on life ts included among the  evils of war. Data from all nations are ap palllng. For the United States of America,  100,000 were killed in World War I. Over  400,000 died in World War II. In the first  200 years as a nation, the lives of over one  mlllion Americ&ns were lost due to war.  Regrettable as Is  the loss of loved ones  from war, these figures are dwarfed by the  toll of another war that annually claims  more casualties than the total number of fa talities from all the wars of this nation.  In  It Is a war on the defenseless-and the  voiceless. It Is a war on the unborn.  This war, labeled abortion, is of epidemic  proPortion and Is ,waged globally. Over 55  mlllion abortions were rePorted worldwide  in the year 1974 alone.1 Sixty-four percent  of the world's PoPulation now live in soci eties that legally sanction this practice.   the United States of America, over 1.5 mil lion  abortions  are  performed  annually.a  About 30 percent of all pregnancies now end  in abortion.   In some metroPolitan areas,  there are more abortions performed than  live births.1 Comparable data also come  from other nations.  Yet society professes reverence for human  life. We weep for those who die, pray and  work for those whose lives are in Jeopardy.  For years, I have labored with other doctors  here and abroad, struggling to prolong life.  It Is Impossible to describe the grief a physi cian feels when the life of a patient is lost.  Can anyone lmaglne how we feel when life  Is destroyed at its rooU;, as though it were a  thing of naught?  What sense of  inconsistency can allow  people to grieve for their dead, yet be cal loused to this baleful war being waged on  life at the time of its silent development?  What logic would encouage efforts to pre serve the life of a critically ill 12-week-old  infant, but countenance the termination of  another life 12 weeks after inception? More  attention Is seemingly focused on the fate of  a life at some penitentiary's death row than  on the mlllions totally deprived of life's OP Portunity  through  such  odious  carnage  before birth.  The Lord has  repeatedly declared  this  devlne Imperative: ""Thou shalt. not kill."" 1  Recently he added, ""nor do anything like  unto it"" <D&C 59:6>.  Even before the fullness of the gospel was  restored,  the enlightened understood  the  sanctity of life. John Calvin, 16th century  reformer, wrote:  ""If it seems more disgraceful that a man  be killed in his own home than in his field since for every man his home Is his sanctu ary-how much more abominable Is it ... to  kill  a  fetus  . . . who has not yet been  brought into the light. 7""  But what Impropriety could now legalize  that which has been forbidden by the laws  of God from the dawn of time? What twist ed reasoning has transformed mythical con cepts into contorted slogans assenting to a  practice which Is consummately wrong?  These slogans begin with proper concern  for the health of the mother. Infrequently,  instances may occur in which the continu ation of pregnancy could be life-threatening  to the mother. When deemed by competent  medical authorities that the life of one must  be terminated in order to save the life of the  other, many agree that it ts better to spare  the mother. But these circumstances are  rare, particularly where modem medical  care Is available.  1 C. Tietze,  Induced Abortion: A World Review,  1981, note 30 at 19, 1981.

462,428,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, on Monday, Secre tary of State Shultz summarized our  dilemma  and our goals  in Central  America very simply. He said:  We  confront a  fundamental challenge,  challenge to our national interests and to  the freedom and security of our neighbors.  Our goals in Central America are clear: We  seek peace, security, economic progress, and  the growth of freedom and democracy  in  every country.  Nothing could be more clear or rea sonable.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, I have the feeling  we are not listening to the lessons of  history and are eager to repeat the  mistakes of our own past.  Unless we are prepared to tighten  our belts and get behind the Presi dent's policy, history will record this  debate as just another footnote to the  long chapter entitled: ""American For eign Policy Shoots Itself in the Foot Again.''  Forty years  is half a  lifetime for  most of us but little more than a blink  of the eye in history.  With a few notable exceptions, the  dominant theme of the last 40 years  has been one of unprecedented Soviet  expansion in the face of remarkable  U.S.  foreign policy vacillation, weak ness and wishful thinking.  Cuba, Cambodia, Iran, Vietnam were  foreign policy disasters for the United  States in which many of the major  battles were fought and lost right here  at home rather than on overseas bat tlefields.  If Harry Truman is watching, he is  spinning in his grave at the prospect  of another self-imposed setback in a  long list of foreign policy defeats since  World War II to which he provided  the strongest exception.  He stood up to Communist expan sion in Western Europe in a way that  has helped contain  the Soviets and  maintain the status quo there as no where else in the world.  Had he not been the strong excep tion to modern U.S. history, Western  Europe might well have gone the way  of the Eastern bloc nations.  As the dominoes continue to topple  in  the Southeast Asian vacuum we  helped create, we are preparing the  same sort of free-fire zone Communist  aggression in Central America.  And, while our policy weaknesses are  the same as in the past, this time the  revolver is clearly in the hands of the  Congress and aimed squarely at Amer ica's achilles heel.  Central America  is not Southeast  Asia or even Western Europe-it is our  own front yard.  Even our isolationist forefathers had  the good sense to recognize the West ern Hemisphere as an area in which  America's vital interests were perma nently at risk.  Let's face the facts. To some people  in this Congress, it is more important  to def eat the President's program in  Central America than to save democ racy in that nearby region. To some, it  is more  important  to politicize  this  issue than to understand the reality of  Central America today.  By failing to understand what the  Contras represent, many in this Con gress are missing the big picture. They  fail to see what is developing in Cen tral America and what the future will  bring.  What kind of neighbors do we want  to have in this hemisphere? It is easy  to criticize a program. Many of you  oppose the President. I challenge you  to come up with a workable and realis tic alternative to what we are doing in  Central America.  It is easy to see that the Sandinistas  are dyed-in-the-wool Marxist-Leninists  who continue to talk like Soviet-style  dictators. They  have  attacked  the  church  in  that country,  the press,  ",1985

Mr. Brody was characterized by his fond ness for the FSLN <the Sandinista govern ment> for he made it known that he was a  friend of Commander Daniel Ortega Saave dra, showing a picture of him hugging the  Commander.  Now,  this is  the type of interrela tionship  of well-intentioned  people  who go down  there and develop a  friendship for Mr. Ortega or Mr. D'~­ coto or other members of the junta  and come back and presume to tell us  the truth about what is happening in  Nicaragua,  totally  overlooking  the  abuses of human rights, the imprison ment, the forced labor camps, the tor ture, the execution that is going on at  the hands of the Sandinista govern ment.  It concerns me greatly and I think  that when we hear allegations such as  have been brought out by the other  side to the effect of how horrible the  Contras are, we have to look to the  source of their material.  I would  hope  everybody  in  this  Chamber would question the source of  the material that is being discussed  today.  ",1985

Well, consider  this fact. The very  first Minister of Defense of the Sandi nista government after July 1979 was  a former full colonel in the Guardia  Nationale named Bernardino Larios;  when he saw the Government going  Communist he resigned, but before he  could leave the country he was arrest ed and thrown in jail for 4 years. He  has just been released, and I suppose  if we brought him up here and quested  him in the Rayburn Room to talk to  to some of the Members who attack  the so-called Contras, our Members  would say no."" As one of the majority  members said to me when I asked him  to come off the floor to meet Enrique  Bermudez, so  that Senor Bermudez  could testify to his face that he spent  will  the 3 years of Somoza struggle here in  Washington.

We can argue the numbers of people  who are in the positions of power back  and forth, both on the political side  and on the military side. The fact of  the matter is that we see atrocities.  These have not been, as the gentle man suggested, by patronizing Ameri can citizens who tried to go down and  to develop  the facts for  themselves,  but by independent organizations that  have found atrocities on both sides;  American Watch and other organiza tions.

And  those are not people who have gone  down  to  swallow  hook,  line,  and  sinker, the Sandinista line. The fact of  the matter remains that that is  the  case. There have been  rapes,  there  have been kidnapings, there have been  murders by Contras in the field.  ",1985

I simply point out again that the  two  independent missionaries, Mor mon missionaries, who have no alle giance to the Federal Government or  the Sandinista government at all, who  have experience as missionaries in the  field, went down there for exactly that  purpose, and point out very clearly in  their report that they were unfunded  by anybody. They went down at their  own expense.  They found no evidence of Contras  atrocities and abundant evidence of  Sandinista atrocities, including forced  labor camps, executions, religious per secution, indiscriminate shelling of vil lages,  mistreatment  of  prisoners,  forced voluntarism in the co-op system  and repression of the opposition politi cal parties, as well as forced recruit ment.  ",1985
476,441,7,Mr. MILLER  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, if I can reclaim my time, I  will  think clearly this is the tragedy of the  situation which has been created, and  that is the overall violence in Nicara gua, which I must add was not there  prior to the entrance of this policy.  ",1985

478,441,7,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Chairman,  Joe  Louis once said about one of his oppo nents, ""He can run, but he can't hide.""  My distinguished colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have been danc ing around and trying to hide from  what really is the issue in this situa tion. The United States of America,  through  the Reagan administration,  has waged war against a country with  which we have full diplomatic rela tions and the people of the United  States of America in every poll and  survey that has been taken have said  that they will not sit still for that and  they oppose  the President's policy.  What  the Congress of  the United  States and this House will be doing at  the end of this debate is to transform  into action, once again, the will of the  people of the United States and keep  Ror....Ud  Reagan  from  getting  the  United States directly militarily  in volved in Nicaragua.  I have been to Nicaragua twice now.  I was there about a week and a half  ago. I had occasion to speak, to wit ness, to listen to people at all levels,  opposition  as well  as  government  people. I have also visited other Cen tral American countries. I want to tell  you something. If you are an average  citizen in most of the Central Ameri can countries, if you are a citizen of El  Salvador, if you are a citizen of Guate mala, you have nowhere near the ca pacity to openly criticize your govern ment as you do if you are a citizen of  Nicaragua, and there  is no question  about that.  ",1985
479,441,7,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Chair man, will the gentleman yield on that  point?  ",1985
480,441,7,Mr. WEISS.," No. When I finish, the  gentleman will get time from his side  of the aisle.  Let's  talk  about  freedom  of  the  press. Yes, the newspaper La Prensa,  one of the largest newspapers in Nica ragua, is censored, and I oppose that;  but if you are a press person in El Sal vador and you owned an independent  newspaper, nonsupportlve of the mili tary-government  position,  you  no  longer publish. You either had your  plant bombed out from under you or  you have been threatened with assassi nation or have been assassinated and  you are no longer there.  The gentleman from California [Mr.  LAGOMARSINO] had occasion to mention  before that the Sandinistas would not  let him visit a military camp and that  proved that they did not have an open  government.  ",1985
481,467,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield 81h minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania CMr. RITTER].  Mr. RITrER. Mr.  Chairman,  I  would like to ask my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle whether they  realize  that  the position  they  are  taking on this issue flies in the face of  Democratic leadership from FDR to  Harry Truman to Hubert Humphrey  to John F. Kennedy to Henry Jackson  to Zbigniew Brezezinski.  I would like to go back to statements  John F. Kennedy made at the time of  the Cuban crisis in 1961. He states:      it is clear that the forces of commu nism are not to be underestimated, in CUba  or anywhere else in the world. The advan tages of a police state-its use of mass terror  and arrests to prevent the spread of free dis sent-cannot be overlooked by those who  expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant. If  the self discipline of the free cannot match  the iron discipline of the mailed fist-in eco nomic, political, scientific, and all the other  kinds of struggles as well as the military then the peril to freedom will continue to  majority  leader, who  aspires  to be  Speaker of the House. On the situa tion in Nicaragua he stated:  There is no question that the Sandinistas  have very nearly completed a transition to a  police state  in Nicaragua. They have  in stalled in each city residential block an in former whose official  responsibility  is  to  report to the government whenever there  are meetings of as many as four or five  people gathering in any home-reminiscent  of mtler's Nazi Germany.  On the threat that Nicaragua poses  to its neighbors the distinguished gen tleman from Texas CMr. WRIGHT] went  on to say:  I do not think there is any question that  they pose a threat to their neighbors, not  only to those neighbors into whose territory  they have sent armed guerrillas. Also that  threat is felt in Costa Rica and Panama.      in Costa Rica  they have  tried  to  create general strikes. They have been un successful because of the popularity of the  Costa Rican democracy and the Costa Rican  leaders. Nevertheless,  such attempts are  being made.  On Central American hesitation for  publicly  closer  relations with  the  United States, the words of the gentle man from Texas CMr. WRIGHT]  are  telling.  ""One  national  leader  ...  whose identity will evoke real credibil ity with you,  said a very  revealing  ~hing to me in private, in answer to a  question. He said the reason leaders in  Latin America are loathe to cozy up  very closely  in public to the United  States and publicly  to endorse our  policies  is because of our habit, he  said, of abandoning those who have  been our best friends."" I repeat,""*     abandoning those who have been our  best friends.""  rise.  Does not that same statement apply  today?  He went on to say:  The evidence is clear and the hour is late.  We and our Latin friends will have to face  the fact that we cannot postpone any longer  the real issue of survival of freedom in this  hemisphere  itself. On  that  issue, unlike  some others, there can be no middle ground.  In 1947 another Democrat, President  Harry Truman, told the Congress:  I believe  it must be  the policy of  the  United States to support free people who  are resisting subjugation by armed minori ties or by outside pressure.  calls  0 1520  Zbigniew Brzezinski says, in a recent  newspaper article:  Yes, the dictatorship in Nicaragua is  controlled by an armed minority that  involves a few Nicaraguans at the top,  thousands of Soviet and Cuban advis ers, and a litany of what Jeane Kirk patrick, up until recently, I might add,  a well-known Democrat,  the  Soviet International Fighting Force.  Michael Novak, another Democrat,  in a  recent letter to the gentleman Managua  saying:  from  Illinois CMr. HYDE]  closes by  An th  o  er  d  emocra w  t  ith  a sm  all ""d""  respected here in the Congress, Jose  These policies are  logical extensions of  those the Carter administration was begin ning  to adopt  in  its  last few months  in  office. They include plans for social and eco nomic development and aid for  the anti Sandinista resistance as well as pressure on  for  pluralism  and  democratic  reform.  dent's initiative: In a recent letter to  President Reagan:  That is why 1 urge you and your colleagues to proceed with the most clear eyed Napolean Duarte, said about the Presi realism. To my mind, it is indispensible that  the power of the democratic forces seeking  a  democratic, non-Marxist Nicaragua be  kept as strong as possible.  Indeed,  they  should be encouraged to grow as powerful  as the people of Nicaragua desire.  The false test is to wait to see how far the  Sandinistas, unchecked, will go. The proper  test  is  to see how strong  the revolution  against Sandinismo can grow. The latter is  the proper course for those whose priority is  liberty. our own Revolution  in  the U.S.  could not have been successful without outside assistance  from France, Poland, and  elsewhere. One should always bet on liberty.  While House democratic leadership  seeks to pull the rug out from under  our assistance to democratic forces in  Nicaragua, Fidel Castro continues his  support for armed insurrection in Cen tral and South America. According to  I would like to quote some recent rea  recent article  in  the Washington  marks from the last debate we had on Times, Roger Fontaine  stated  that  this very issue by another well-known  ""Fidel Castro's top intelligence oper figure  in the Democratic Party, the  ation officer recently made clear that  Your  initiative and approach have my  complete support and I strongly urge all of  the friends of Central America in your Con gress to give it their full backing. It is the  right step at the right time in our quest for  peace and democracy in this region.  Cuba would continue its aid to Salva doran Marxist guerrillas and other in surgent forces in Latin America.""  Thus, under pressure  from demo cratic  leadership,  the United States  curtails its support, pulls the rug out  from the democrats, small ""d"", fight ing in Nicaragua while Castro goes on  supporting so-called revolution.  Certainly this is not the democratic  leadership of FDR, Truman, Kennedy,  and Humphrey. Recently  there has  been a nationwide debate over  the  future of the Democratic Party. Mr.  AsPIN, the distinguished chairman of  the Armed Services Committee of this  House, said that ""Democrats need to  cease  to  be  naysayers  on  defense  issues.""  Arizona Governor Babbitt talked re cently  about  Democrats  shifting  toward the center. The issue of aiding  democratic  resistance  in  Central  America is a major test of the Demo crats' actions not Just words in their  effort to shift back into the center.  This issue will have a chilling effect if  the House democratic leadership has  its way; it will have a chilling effect on  the more conservative and moderate  democratic efforts to move their party  back into the center.  ",1985
482,467,7,Mr. ADDABBO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself 30 seconds. I will tell the  gentleman who Just left the well that  the Democrats do remember the Gulf  of Tonkin resolution and that is why  we oppose  the resolution before us,  House Joint Resolution 239. This Joint  resolution approves military assistance  only and has nothing to do with hu manitarian assistance. We should not  supply arms to the Contras and en courage armed conflict in the area.

483,467,7,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," First of all, Mr.  Chairman, I am putting in the RECORD  the letter that all of us were sent by  over half of America's living Nobel  laureates urging  this body  to  tum  down the aid to the Contras. I think it  is a very, very important letter; it is  one of the most elite and distinguished  and intelligent groups this country has  produced. I certainly hope that every body reads  it.  I know you all have  copies in your office.  I also hope the people look at the bi partisan alternative which I  think is  the way that we should be going. We  should be trying much harder to go  back to our tradition of a bipartisan  foreign policy.  Now what can be said here that is  new?  I'm trying  to  respond  to  the  debate rather than Just give a stand ard speech.  What I have heard from Members  over and over again is they keep citing  Democrats and keep  saying  today's  Democrats  have  not  learned  from  them.  ",1985

485,480,7,Mr. WOLPE., I yield to the gentle man.  ,1985
486,480,7,Mr. HYDE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I  have heard  the  statement made repeatedly that there  are more Somozistas in the military  command of the FON, the democratic  resistance, and I  just would tell you  that according to the resource paper  put out by the State Department to  the  press  and  to  everybody,  that  among the military command, former  Sandinistas are 43 percent; former na tional  guardsmen  32  percent;  and  Campesinos 19 percent.  Of the 56  regional and task force  commanders  in  the FON,  27 were  former Sandintstas; 13 were National  Guardsmen, none above the rank of  lieutenant; and 12 were farmers. So it  just is not so. There are more ex-So mozistas with the Sandinista govern ment and there are more ex-Sandinis tas with the democratic resistance.  D 1700  ",1985
487,480,7,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Chairman, if I may  reclaim my time to respond to the gen tleman, the point that I think needs to  be understood is that former Somozis tas are numbered among the highest  ranks of Contra command structure. It  is simply improbable, to say the least,  that  such  leaders  could  command  I  the  CMr.  thank  credibility among the Nicaraguan pop ulation.  The CHAIRMAN.

489,480,7,Mr. WOLPE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this additional time to me.  Mr. Chairman, if I might just con clude that thought. The fact of the  matter is, when we lend our own credi bility and support to individuals at the  command  level who  are  so  closely  identified with  the  former dictator  Somoza, it is simply politically foolish.  It is counterproductive and it plays  into the hands of the more radical ele ments of the Sandinista population.  ",1985

I do want to make  a point that there is a political leader ship within the Contra that has as sumed military relationship, military  umbrella, Mr. Calero and Mr. Cruz  and many others that I would like to  respectfully say are, I  think, positive  forces. They are moderate.

The Chair will an nounce that the time remaining for  the gentleman from New York CMr.  ADDABBO]  is 1 hour and 52 minutes,  and the time remaining for the gentle man from Michigan [Mr. BROOMPIELD]  is 2 hours and 14 minutes.

495,480,7,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," I thank the gen tleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman,  there has been a  great deal of criticism about the U.S.  role in Central America. I find that re markable particularly in view of the  successes that we have enjoyed in El  Salvador over the last 6 years, what  with the free elections and the new  President,  the constituent assembly,  and the constitution the Salvadorans  now enjoy.  ",1985
496,493,7,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  propose a compromise, whether it be  on this floor at a later time or whether  it come from the other body. The com promise I offer is as follows:  First, keeping  the Boland amend ment.  Second, providing $14 million in hu manitarian aid to the Contras to be  split evenly or otherwise between the  International Red Cro8s and U.S. Gov ernment channels, preferably through  AID.  Third,  cleaning  up  the Contras,  which means eliminating former So mosistas and developing a positive po litical program which would include a  type of Bill of Rights and humanitari an reforms.  Let me explain in more detail.  First, there is a political requirement  for keeping the Boland amendment.  Most Americans believe it wrong to be  involved in efforts to overthrow a gov ernment with which we have diplo matic relations.  Second, by splitting the humanitari an aid request between the Interna tional Red Cross and the U.S. Govern ment, the United States would be un derscoring its concern for the legiti mate needs of refugees who have fled  Nicaragua and who are now living in  Costa Rica and Honduras. Money for  the Contras would be stretched out  over 18 months, once again for hu manitarian purposes to aid Nicaraguan  refugees but tied to efforts to put to gether a program to clean out former  Somosistas and establish a liberal, in  the classic sense, democratic program.  And third, I stress the importance of  transforming the Contras into a legiti mate alternative to the present gov ernment. We have to change the per ceptions of the American public and  international opinion toward the Con tras. This means that we have to sup port Arturo Cruz in the Nicaraguan  situation in much the same way we  supported Napoleon Duarte in El Sal vador.  Just a few years ago the situation in  El Salvador was pretty grim-death  squads on the right and Communist  guerrillas on the left. Democratic lib erals in Congress helped change the  situation by  strengthening Duarte's  hand. President Duarte, a true demo crat, was able to convince the military  that without a curb in death squad ac tivity the change of continued U.S. aid  were slight. Progress has been made in  El Salvador against both the extreme  left and right.  In the Nicaraguan situation, Arturo  Cruz is the same kind of individual as  Napoleon Duarte. He fought against  Somoza, and was arrested on two dif ferent occasions. He also served as a  member of the present Sandinista gov ernment until he reluctantly came to  the conclusion that they had no inten tion of honoring promises made to the  OAS in 1979. He is a respected politi cal leader and a true democrat. He and  others like him are the kind of individ uals whom we need to support and  who deserve our support.  As part of the effort to make the  Contras a truly legitimate alternative,  they need to put together a positive  political program. Such a  program  should include: an explanation of the  proposed economic structure with a  detailed account of positions on land  reform, market guarantees, business  safeguards; a commitment to a plural istic political system; guarantees en suring that the military would be con trolled; policies concerning  taxation,  education,  freedom of speech, press,  and religion. The program should also  openly accept gains made by the San dinistas  in health and education. It  should reject the Sandinista authori tarian  apparatus:  neighborhood  de fense committees, mass control organi zations, and ideologically oriented edu cation.  As part of this process toward legiti mizing the Contras the effort should  be made to open up the movement to  international  organizations-Red  Cross, Amnesty International-church  groups, and news media observes  in  order to secure the kind of interna tional acclaim and support attained by  the Sandinistas in 1978-79.  This is how we should proceed.  ",1985

498,493,7,Mr. SHUMWAY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to sup port the resumption of United States  assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels  in Nicaragua. The social,  economic,  and political problems that continue  to plague Nicaragua and to promote  tragic violence  there concern us all,  and it is because of that concern that I  urge my colleagues to lift their prohi bitions on aid to the Contras and allow  the United States to once again sup port those who are fighting for peace  and democracy in the region.  Mr. Chairman, I have listened care fully to this debate during the course  of the day today and I have some con",1985
499,532,7,Mr. LEHMAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, today the House begins de liberations on whether or not to re lease $14 million in military aid to the  Contras in Nicaragua.  Today we can help decide whether  the conflict between the Contras and  Sandinistas continues, o:r. whether the  United States takes a more construc tive role in seeking a negotiated peace  in the region.  Today we can take a step closer to  achieving the goal of political and eco nomic stability in Nicaragua by send ing a signal to those countries partici pating in the Contadora peace process,  that this government does not want to  contribute to the continuing military  escalation in the region and that we  would like to make a positive contribu tion to the Contadora process.  Our covert military involvement in  Nicaragua so far has been a violation  of  international  law, morally  repre hensible, and contrary to the best in terests of the United States in this  hemisphere.  I agree with the administration that  we should support democratic changes  and institutions in Nicaragua, just as  we should support democratic changes  in Chile and South Africa. However, I  disagree on the means of achieving  those democratic goals.  The alternative to a foreign policy  which emphasizes military might  is  one which achieves peace through ne ~otiations-negotiations with the San dinista Government and its neighbors.  I urge my colleagues to resist the ad ministration's public  relations  cam paign and oppose the continuation of  funding for the Contras.e  e ",1985
500,532,7,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in opposition  to  the  resolution  before us today that would make avail able $14 million in military aid to the  rebels in Nicaragua. No matter how it  comes, military aid to the Contras in  Nicaragua  is unacceptable policy for  the United States.  The administration has cried woll on  this issue too many times. I would like  to ask this administration, ""Where is  the evidence  to support your argu ments?""  First,  the  administration  sounded  the alarm when it suspected that the  Soviet Union was shipping Mig-21 air craft to Central America. But, the ad ministration  has  no  evidence  that  those crates ever left the Soviet docks.  Where are these Mig-21 aircraft?  Then, last year, the administration  accused the Sandinistas of exporting  large quantities of arms into El Salva dor. But, the administration has yet to  come  to Congress with evidence  to  support this claim. Where are those  shipments of arms?  And, this year, to defend this very  resolution, the administration claimed  the aid would be used as bargaining le verage  in negotiations between  the  Contras  and  the Sandinistas. But,  where are the negotiations?  And, more recently, the administra tion claims it has the support of Costa  Rica and Colombia. But, where are  those words of support from President  Monge and President Betancur?  Finally,  the administration claims  that only one-third of the Contra com mand structure is former Somoza Na tional Guardsmen. The Arms Control  and Foreign Policy Caucus not only  claims that 46 out of 48 Contra leaders  are Somoza heirs, but  also  names  them. Where are the names that sup port the administration's claims?  There are just too many inconsisten cies  in  the administration's Central  American policy.  All Americans want to see an end to  the violence in Central America and  the  restoration of  stability  in  the  region. We want to be able to offer the  people of Central America an alterna tive  to  totalitarian  and  dictatorial  leadership, as well as an alternative to  further military conflict. Basic liber ties  and human  rights only mean  something if they can be exercized in  peace.  The Contra war against the Sandi nista regime  in Nicaragua does not  contribute  to  stability  in Central  America.  It contributes  to  neither  peace nor democracy.  A vote against this resolution is not  a vote for communism. It ls a vote  against a military solution to the prob lems in Central America. It ls a vote  that rejects the administration's mili tary priorities.  Later on, we will have an opportuni ty to off er the people of Nicaragua  and Central America a peaceful alter native. A constructive policy in Cen tral America means support for  the  Contadora process. And economic de velopment aid that will solve the in digenous economic problems  in Cen tral America that lead to political in stability.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this  resolution.  Thankyou.e  of California. Mr.  Chairman, it ls time that the United  States stopped trying to singlehandede Mr. BROWN  ly change the Government in Nicara gua through military intervention. We  have learned from past experiences in  Vietnam and elsewhere that this is not  often a successful policy, and is one  which requires tremendous American  resources:  a  tremendous amount of  money and an unacceptable  loss of  lives.  Aid to the Contras has been one of  the most debated policies in Congress.  We have thoroughly discussed the ill  effects of our current policies,  the  ""perceived"" Communist threat of the  Sandinista government to the United  States, as well as the need for some  form of pressure on the Sandinista  government  to  improve  its human  rights record and to limit its power to  extend revolution to other countries.  What we have  learned  from  this  debate is that the situation is not as  black and white as the President por trays it. We have seen further that the  President's military aid to the Contras  has proved to be neither a popular,  nor a very effective policy.  We have seen that military aid to  the Contras has not accomplished our  goals. Nor can we realistically expect a  limited amount of military aid to be  instrumental in the overthrow of the  Sandinista government. Even  if  this  somewhat dubious goal were achieved,  what guarantee would we have that  the new regime would be more demo cratic, that it would be more consis tant with American interests, or even  that it would hold the support of the  Nicaraguan people?'  Revolution  is not new  to Central  America, nor will it go away through  military force. The problems leading  to political instability in Nicaragua, as  well as in all of Central America, re sults mainly from poor living condi tions. The area ls plagued by unem ployment,  inflation, poverty, hunger,  illiteracy,  disease,  and  declining  growth and  investment. In order to  find  long-term solutions  regional  and  local unrest, we must address  these sources of political instability as  well.  Our military pressure on the Sandi nistas,  by  supporting  the Contras,  simply  justifies the militarization of  Nicaragua and  the oppressive meas ures taken by the Sandinista regime.  The  threat  of  the  ""Imperialistic  Yankee""  from  the north gives  the  Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega a col losal enemy to rally his forces against,  and helps him  to generate popular  support.  In addition, our unilateral military  approach hurts U.S. credibility in the  international  community,  especially  when the legality of our policy is at  best, questionable. Our policy of sup porting the terrorist activities of the  Contras underscores the international  perception of the United States as an  aggressive bully pursuing its own intO  .  f  ",1985
501,545,7,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, today we have heard  the pros and cons of the President's  policies in search of peace, stability,  and democracy in Central America.  Now the choice is clear: Are we going  to support the forces for freedom in  51-059 0-86-18 (pt. 7)  Nicaragua through humanitarian aid,  or are we through our action, or inac tion, going to let the professed Marx ist-Leninist  leadership of Nicaragua  prevail with all that means to its long  suffering people and to our own legiti mate interests in the area.  President Reagan has presented a  solid  peace  proposal. He  has  also  promised not to use the appropriated  $14 million for arms. To those who  have raised the specter of U.S. troops  in Nicaragua,  let me  say  that  the  President has given assurances  that  this legislation will not be used to jus tify the use of U.S. Armed Forces. In  plain English  this  legislation  is no  back door for sending troops there.  The legislation before us is  in the  national interest of our country. We  must choose whether to support the  President in his efforts to stop Soviet  encroachment by proxy in our hemi sphere. If we fail this test, the world  will know we are not serious in our  support of freedom. I urge a vote on  this resolution for freedom in Central  America.  ",1985

503,545,7,Mr. ADDABBO.," Mr. Chairman, we  have indeed had a lengthy and ardu ous debate today, in the great tradi tion of this great deliberative body.  We have now come  to that time to  vote. The question  is simple on the  vote tonight. It is not a complicated  question. We have received and again I  will read the letter of transmittal from  the President accompanying his classi fied report submitted to Congress. It  reads as follows:  I  Pursuant to provisions of title VIII, sec tion 8066 of the Department of Defense Ap propriations Act, 1985 (Public Law 98-473,  enacted October 12, 1984; 98 Stat. 1935>. I  herewith transmit a classified report on U.S.  suppart for the democratic resistance move ment in Nicaragua. On the basis of  this  report, I have determined that assistance  for military or paramilitary operations now  prohibited by Section 8066A of that Act is  necessary.  The resolution we will be voting on  tonight, very shortly, is House Joint  Resolution 239 introduced by the gen tleman  from  Illinois CMr. MICHEL],  which again says:  Resolved b11 the Senate and House of Rep resentattves of the United Statu of America  in Congress assembled, That the Congress  approves the obligation and expenditure of  funds available for fiscal year 1985 for sup porting, directly or indirectly, military or  paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.  There is not one word in the classi fied report submitted by the President  or the resolution on humanitarian aid.  That is a Gulf of Tonkin resolution. It  provides military aid pure and simple.  If the President wants to use funds  for humanitarian aid, he cannot use  these  funds. These  funds  are  earwill  239,  you will  marked for military purposes and he  has asked for release of these funds  for military purposes.  If he wants  these funds to be used for humanitari an aid, after the Congress votes down  House Joint Resolution 239  tonight,  he can send a letter in support of BoB  MICHEL'S  resolution,  if  he wishes,  which talks about humanitarian aid. A  letter fl-om the President, a press re lease from the President, a discussion  by the President on humanitarian aid  is not  law. This  resolution  is  law.  House Joint Resolution 239 which you  will be asked to vote on very shortly,  that is law. And if you vote for House  Joint Resolution  be  voting to give the President $14 mil lion for one purpose and one purpose  alone, and that is for additional mili tary aid,  the  foot  in  the door  for  future  increases of military aid  to  Nicaragua.  It is simple. Tomorrow you can vote  on humanitarian aid, whether  it be  the Hamilton resolution or whether it  be the Bob Michel resolution. That  cover  humanitarian  assistance.  Tonight the resolution before you is  simple and clear cut. As I have pointed  out to you, it provides for paramilitary  or military aid as requested by  the  President.  ",1985

506,545,7,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding. I wish to  associate myself with the gentleman's  remarks and support his position most  vigorously, and I rise in opposition to  House Joint Resolution 239 to release  $14 million in previously appropriated  funds for use ""to support directly or  indirectly military or paramilitary op erations in Nicaragua."" This position  is consistent with earlier votes I have  cast on this subject, and it also demon strates my belief that the release of  these funds at this time could have  ominous consequences in the future.  We find ourselves in the unenviable  position of having to, in effect, choose  between the lesser of two evils. The  first  evil  the Sandinista govern ment-a government of deceit. The  second  increased support on  the  part of the United States for the Con tras, and the potential it has for in volving us more deeply than ever in  the conflict. I contend that the second  evil has far graver consequences for  our Nation and its people. No one can  quarrel with the premise that efforts  must be undertaken to bring peace to  Central America. It is also hard to dis agree with the premise that we must  work to put pressure on the Sandinis tas to engage in a good faith diplomat ic process aimed at a promotion of  self-determination in Nicaragua.

I hope the gentleman understands  that one of the reasons that is taking  place is because there is a very, very  strong feeling on our side of the aisle.  I am not certain that many of the  Members on that side of the aisle un derstand the depth of concern about  this issue. It is a concern with an issue  that we feel is fundamental to the mi nority; that if in fact this process is al lowed to go forward conducted in the  way it has been conducted thus far,  that it runs the risk of perhaps disen franchising much of the minority over  a period of time.

Now, I feel pretty confident, to tell  you the truth, that the subcommittee  that I happen to have the privilege of  chairing, that I do not think the mi nority would say that.  The first bill that will come to this  floor out of that subcommittee is the  bill sponsored by the excellent ranking  minority member, JACK Fu:LJ>s  from  Texas.

514,558,7,Mr. HUNTER.," Let me just ask the  gentleman this. The point of our argu ment was this. It was that they count ed unnotarized absentee ballots that  had been distributed to the precincts,  which actually was an improper move  under  the  force  analysis; but  when Mr. McCloskey got four votes  ahead and they had some 29 unnotar ized absentee ballots with real people's  names on them and real people's ad dresses on them, the task force says,  ""Even  though  there were notarized  statements or there were 2JWOrn state ments  from  the county clerks  that  they had secured those ballots, nobody  messed with  them,""  they said, ""We  don't want to count the last 29 bal lots.""

Frankly,  if a person was not very  close within this task force situation,  I, frankly, do not know how we would  have the information. I know that the  chairman of the task force makes an  argument on those 29 ballots. I have  not heard that. I think we are going to  have a chance to hear that tomorrow.  I want to hear that argument. I have  heard  the argument  the gentleman  said. I want to hear that other argu ment.  ",1985

We are dealing in very fine technica lities, but the person that we hired,  who supposedly was to tell us how this  election should have been conducted,  said today on the record, it is on tape  of him saying  that he would have  counted the ballots.

I also want to say,  the gentleman  forgot about that special order. There  was a special order here 2 or 3 years  ago on behalf of the nuclear weapons  freeze. It really was on behalf of the  nuclear weapons freeze, but it was the  whole nuclear arms race that went all  night. I participated in that. I was part  of the organizer of that and I thought  that was a very good thing to do.  I am not a person that thinks that  having a special order on an important  issue is wrong.

526,571,7,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speak er. I want to commend and call to the  attention of the American people and  the retailing community an effort by a  major department store chain to keep  Americans at work.  Sunday s Washington Post profiled  the Wal-Mart Stores' ""Buy America""  program whereby the 753-store chain  is making a determined effort to buy  products that are made in the United  States. instead of abroad.  In the words of company officials.  the effort is to prove that American  manufacturers can produce the qual ity of goods at prices comparable to  imported goods.  There are many Wal-Mart stores in  my congressional district in Texas and  I believe consumers who are aware of  our serious imbalance in trade will be  aware buying at these stores will be re storing or saving jobs of their fellow  Americans.  The Bentonville, AR  firm which  bought about 5 percent of  its mer chandise last year from foreign manu facturers, want to reduce that to 4 per cent this year and even lower percent ages in future years.  I am hopeful the chief executive of ficers of other retail chains will follow  the lead of Wal-Mart Chairman Sam  Walton.  I want to share the Post article with  you and I wish Wal-Mart much success  in their efforts.  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 19851  WAL-MART  FLYS  THE  FLAG  IN  IMPORT  BATTLE-PRODS U.S. PRODUCERS WITH FA VORABLE TERK8  <By Caroline E. Mayer)  Late last year, Sam Walton, the chairman  of Wal-Mart Stores Inc .  gave his merchan dise buyers an order: Think. of a product  that American manufacturers have given up  on because of competition from cheaper im ports.  An apparel buyer suggested inexpensive  flannel shirts, virtually all of which are now  made outside the United States.  Today. the 753-store discount chain has a  $600,000 contract with a  small Brinkley,  Ark., manufacturer  for  240,000  flannel  shirts-one-tenth of what the company an ticipates it will sell next winter.  ""We've set out to prove that American  manufacturers can make merchandise we  sell on a competitive basis with the same  quality and value as products made over seas,"" said David D. Glass, president of Wal Mart, one of the nation's fastest-growing  and most successful discount chains, second  to K mart Corp. in size.  ""As a company, we are tremendously con cerned with the trade deficit"" Glass said.  ""We see a tremendous erosion of manufac turing jobs in this country as manufacturers  accelerate the movement to go offshore to  make their goods. None of us will believe    I  9109  what this country will be like five  to 10  years from now if we continue to let this  happen.""  Between 1981 and 1984, an estimated 1.6  mllllon American jobs were lost to imports,  Walton recently pointed out in a letter to  his suppliers. ""In one year Cl983 to 19841,  non-oil-related imports grew $70 bllllon, an  increase of 33 percent. The trade deficit  reached $123.3 bllllon, an increase of 78 per cent. Something can and must be done to re verse this very serious threat to our free en terprise system and our great country;  he  wrote.  Now Walton wants to try to turn the tide.  Last month the company officially launched  a novel and ambitious Buy-American cam paign to prod domestic manufacturers to  produce more goods at home. Last year the  company purchased about 5 percent of its  goods  from  foreign manufacturers. This  year, Walton said he hopes to reduce that to  4 percent through his campaign, with fur ther reductions in the years ahead.  By offering unusual favorable terms-in cluding longer lead times and more advanta geous  financial  agreements-Wal-Mart  hopes to prove that American manufactur ers can make quality products  that will  match or beat the prices of imported goods.  ""We are willing to work with the domestic  manufacturers to a greater extent than we  have done before,"" Glass said.  Also, Wal-Mart is willing to lower its mar gins to sell the goods at a competitive price,  Walton said. ""We are asking our manufac turers to lower their margins; in turn, we  will lower ours.''  However, Walton contended that profit ability for the company-which earned $240  mllllon  last year on sales of $6 bllllon should  improve because  force  the  company to make better buys. Perhaps even  more significantly,  the campaign will be  promoted  in Wal-Mart's stores,  creating  more ""enthusiastic and appreciative custom ers:  Walton noted.  The contract for flannel shirts with Farris  Fashions Inc. is the first test of Wal-Mart s  resolve.  To help Farris Fashions Inc. be price-com petitive, Wal-Mart has helped locate and fi nance the fiannel material it needed to meet  the contract. ""Without Wal-Mart's help, I  would have given up on the project long  ago,"" noted Farris' president, Farris Bur roughs. ""I kept beating my head to find  piece goods and financing:' he said, noting  that he had called every textile manufactur er he knew. unsuccessfully looking for mate rial. mttmately, Wal-Mart called manufac turers to find goods and promised favorable  financing terms for the goods to help Farris  get a start.  Additionally, Wal-Mart ""has agreed to pay  us a little quicker than normai:  Burroughs  said.  ""If I didn t  have that work, I'd be hard  pressed to keep my 100 employees busy:   said Burroughs. ""Without that contract. I'd  be out beating the bushes. And with busi ness now very slow in the shirt and blouse  business, those bushes are almost all beat  out.''  Wal-Mart didn't have to make these ar rangements. Burroughs said.  ""People are  beating down Wal-Mart's doors to sell them  goods,"" he asserted. ""All Mr. Walton has to  do is to say 'give me so many dozen.' He  doesn't need  to worry about"" where his  goods are being manufactured.  Yet he said Walton does have a direct in terest in the import problem: A lot of the  Americans who are losing jobs as a result of  it will  .  ",1985

On this day of commemoration, let  us rededicate our efforts to end for all  time the evils of religious and racial  injustice wherever they exist. Let us  redouble our efforts to ease the suffer ing of Soviet Jews, to stamp out anti semitism wherever  it  appears,  to  ratify the Genocide Convention in the  Senate of the United States, and to  build a world of true and lasting free dom-freedom  from war  and want,  from fear and oppression.

529,610,7,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this is Professional Secretaries Week.  Last year at this time, I  took to the  floor to pay tribute to the secretaries  in my office. Since that time, much  has changed. Vicki Baer, who was then  and  remains my personal s~cretary,  has married, and we all now know and  love her as Vicki Dodson. Her hus band, Rick Dodson, is a lighting tech nician for NBC News. He n;iay be seen  frequently in the halls of the Capitol,  and occasionally about my office, visit ing his dear bride on a spare moment.  Another welcome change is the im provement  in  the health of Kelley  Prunesti. We are glad to have her back  this year.  One other notable turn is the addi tion of Ms. Mary Stealey to the staff.  Mary replaced Fran Cochran, who has  joined  the ranks of the happily re tired.  Yet, Mr. President,  despite  these  changes,  there  is one constant: my  gratitude  to  Vicki  Dodson,  Julie  Smith, Kelley Prunesti, Emily Can vanagh, and Mary Stealey. They keep  my office running. At all hours of the  day and night, and even on weekends,  they have worked  tirelessly and, all  too often, thanklessly.

530,610,7,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, we  Americans are not alone in our prob lems of drug abuse. As we  join our  allies in the battle against this devas tating international affliction, we dis cover more and more that it is a prob lem of growing significance all over  the Western World.  It  is  the  case with our Nation's  oldest friend, for example. In France,  12 years ago, when the fabled ""French  Connection"" was broken, drug addic tion was rare in this nation. Now, it  seems, the drug problem has returned  to France, with a vengeance.  From solvents, to cocaine, to heroin,  French citizens of all ages are consum ing drugs at an alarming rate. It is es timated that the youth of this nation,  finding  illicit narcotics now  readily  available, are beginning to abuse drugs  at 11 years of age, and this is the case  at every level of society. Reports indi cate  that  the  decreasing  costs  of  drugs-for example, one gram of co caine costs 1,000 French francs, ap proximately $100-due  to  their  in creasing  supply,  and  this  situation  makes their purchase that much more  attractive  to the general population.  Latest estimates show that there are  an estimated 200,000 drug abusers in  France, which relative  to  the entire  population of this nation, represents a  remarkable figure. The problem is ac knowledged as so serious  in France  that both the Federal and local gov ernments are making it a priority, as  indicated by  recent  efforts on  the  parts of both levels of government to  create  the  organizational  structure  necessary to deal with every aspect of  this problem.  Latest  statistics  all  over Western  Europe are equally disturbing:  there  are  now  an  estimated 40,000  drug  abusers in Great Britain; 6,000 in Ire land;  and 250,000  in  Italy. And  in  Italy, for example, a nation which re ported no deaths  caused by  drugs  before the mid-1970's, last year report ed 257 deaths due to drug addiction.  From Dublin to Rome, the supplies  of heroin and cocaine are seemingly  limitless, and even though European  police make more arrests and intercept  more drug shipments every year, the  mounting statistics reflect the growing  problem.  It is felt by European populations  that the most disturbing side effect of  this situation is the paralyzing prob lem of crime. This is a new phenome non in European cities, and a  trend  law enforcement officials are experi encing difficulty in stemming. Reports  from Spanish police authorities,  for  example,  indicate that 75 percent of  their increasing rate of criminal activi ty is drug related.  The battle against drugs has, indeed,  recommenced  in  force  in Western  Europe.  Individual  police  forces  in  these newly beleagured nations report  soaring numbers of arrests and sei zures, and international cooperation is  responsible in large part for many of  the successes of European law enforce ment officials.  We in the United States have fought  the war against drug abuse relatively  alone for a  long  time, and we have  much information we would be only  too happy to share with our friends  across the sea. We have succeeded in  many of our efforts, both public and  private, and we have been unsuccess ful in others. Regardless, we will cap italize on our  successes,  and  learn  from  our  failures,  until we  have  achieved the eradication of drug abuse  in our Nation. And part of our efforts  will now include offering whatever as sistance we can to our allies in West ern Europe, as we now fight this war  together.PRIDE OF NEW JERSEY  ",1985

532,649,7,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, an  unswerving champion of ,civil  rights  and  of  a  decent  home  and  basic  human services for  those of limited  means has passed from our midst.  Patricia Roberts Harris, who died  March  23,  had  a  long  and distin guished career as a dedicated public  servant.  Among the public posts to which Pat  Harris brought grace, dignity, and a  conviction of purpose were delegate to  the United Nations; Ambassador  to  Luxembourg;  Secretary  of Housing  and Urban Development; and Secre tary of Health and Human Services.  She carried out her duties in each of  these positions with versatility and a  quick command of the situation.  At no time, however, did she allow  the power or prestige of these high  public offices to go to her head. Pat  Harris was well aware of and never  forgot her roots as the daughter of a  Chicago pullman car porter. Her expe riences as a black woman and her sen sitivity to the needs of black and other  minority Americans during, not only  times of segregation, but also times of  more subtle and sophisticated discrim ination, were  always with her and  never forgotten. She translated that  sensitivity into a sense of purpose to  right the wrongs of our society. She  constantly challenged us to do better.  I had the good fortune to work close ly with Pat Harris when she served as  Secretary of Housing and Urban De velopment from 1977 to 1979. As the  ranking member of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on HUD and Independ ent Agencies, I was impressed by her  command of the facts and her single mindedness  of  purpose  to  provide  housing for those of low and moderate  income.  In 1977, Secretary Harris came to me  and asked me  to  introduce amend ments  to  the Fair Housing Act  to  strengthen HUD's enforcement role in  conciliating between the parties in in dividual housing discrimination com plaints. I was proud to introduce the  legislation  which,  after  numerous  hearings and markups, was passed by  more than a two-thirds bipartisan ma jority in the House but failed by fili buster to pass the Senate.  Pat Harris did not mince words.  When she saw a wrong to be corrected  she went at it relentlessly, bringing  her acumen in the law to bear.  For example,  in  testimony before  the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on  the Constitution, in response to a Sen ator skeptical of the fair housing bill,  who  feared  it  represented Federal  Government oppression of property  owners, Secretary Harris had this to  say:  I think that objectively, as one examines  the history of this country and especially  the history of housing discrimination, ef forts to bring equality to the one area that I  know about that is consistently refused, the  offer of money by persons who are black, is  not oppressive.  It is an effort to bring equality to the mar ketplace of housing and I cannot agree that  an effort, a genuine, concerned effort  to  bring equality to an area which is clearly  fraught within equality today, is an exam ple of Federal oppression.  It is an example of the implementation of  the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments.  And before the counterpart House  Judiciary Subcommittee, she got right  to the heart of the matter:  Our present authority  is  limited  to a  purely voluntary process of ""conference,  conciliation,  and persuasion.""  I will not  dwell on the ironies associated with a law  that mandates HUD to investigate and to  establish the existence of violations of law,  and then limits the Secretary to asking the  discovered lawbreaker whether he wants to  discuss the matter.  And again, in 1979, before the same  House  Subcommittee,  Secretary  Harris challenged the Congress to act  on a fair housing bill with these words:  Let me say that there are so many conse quences of our falling to solve our housing  problem  in  this country,  that failure  to  make a major effort now, with sufficient en forcement powers, may  lead us  to racial  problems in the generation of the grandchil dren of, certainly, not mine but of my rela tives. We must have the ability in our life times or in the foreseeable futur~ to bring  this commodity of shelter within the pur view of people who are able to purchase it.  It is the only market in which the color of  the money is less important that the color  of the purchaser or the race or national  origin of the purchaser.  ",1985
533,662,7,Mr. ROWLAND  of Georgia.," Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday  in Albany, NY,  some 5,000 physicians out of 40,000  physicians in that State gathered at  the State capitol to focus attention on  the malpractice  insurance premium  problem that we are experiencing in  our country today.  .  To me, that is really impressionable  that this many physicians would have  taken time away from their practice to  focus attention on such a severe prob lem that we now have.  Mr. Speaker, the practice of medi cine is not an exact science. Any proce dure that is undertaken has some ele ment of risk; any treatment that is  prescribed has some element of risk.  Physicians are beginning to view each  case, each illness that they have ~ a  potential malpractice suit.  It is thought by many now that it  may contribute as much as $15 to $40  billion to the increase in cost of medi cal care  in our country, and in my  State alone, it is estimated that it may  add as much as $3 billion.  The quality of care is now being af fected to some extent because there  are many physicians who are practic ing obstetrics that are beginning  to  drop out of that practice simply for  the reason of the threat of malprac tice.  How long are we going to continue  to ignore this growing threat that is  going  to undermine  the quality of  medical care in our country?  0 1250  ARMENIANS DAY  <Mr. DORNAN of California asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.>  ",1985
534,662,7,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  except  for  the  occasions  . when I have engaged in colloquys, I  have  always  started my  remarks  before  this House  for  the  last  4  months, with the words, ""Let justice  be done; seat Rick Mcintyre."" I will  change that today for the first time,  to an intense plea for the majority to  call for another election in the State  of Indiana's Eighth District., I never  .thought I would do this. There has al ready been an honest election. But so  as not to destroy the feeling of good  will among my colleagues for the next  year and a half, I beg for a special  election.  Change of subject: Mr. Speaker, the  reason that Adolf Hitler thought he  was  able  to  slaughter millions and  escape earthly condemnation is easily  discovered  in his own words. Hitler  bragged, ""My brownshirts, my Gesta po, my SS will kill millions of Jews,""  because  look what happened  to  the  Armenians.  Nobody  cared,  nobody  even remembers."" He spoke. He acted.  And then hell ruled part of the Earth  for 12 bloody years.  We must in America recognize for mally, with a day of remembrance, the  agony of the Armenian people. They  suffered the first massive genocide of  this century.  To establish 1 day a year to honor  the over 1112 million innocent Armeni ans who were slaughtered by the Otto man Empire. This is not an insult to  the nation of Turkey. The Ottoman  Empire lasted for precisely 400 years,  from 1517 to 1917. The worst of the  massacres of Armenians  in Turkey  happened during the last 2 years of  that decaying, rotting old empire. The  modem Turkey, restructured by the  great hero of that country, .Ataturk,  should have admitted and rejected the  ghastly genocide of its Armenian citi zens. It does not insult our Turkish  friends to recognize this century's first  horrible examples of man's inhuman ity to man by the incomprehensible  crime of genocide. Actually, President  Ataturk,  the George Washington of  Turkey, acknowledged the 1915 geno cide in August 1926 but it was tragical ly denied by subsequent governments.  Truth is truth. Honor demands that  our Nation do what is right.  THE LATE HONORABLE SAM B.  ERVI.N, JR.  <Mr. VALENTINE  asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1985
535,662,7,Mr.  VALENTINE.," Mr.  Speaker,  today we mourn the death of a great  North Carolinian and statesman, Senator Sam B. Ervin, Jr.  Sam Ervin was a World War I hero,  Harvard Law School graduate, judge,  and U.S. Senator. He served the 10th  District of North Carolina in the U.S.  House  of Representatives,  1946-47,  before he was appointed to the North  Carolina  Supreme  Court. Yet  he  chose, Mr. Speaker, to refer to himself  as ""just a country lawyer from North  Carolina."" He considered the Constitu tion a sacred scripture and he spent  his whole life defending it.  His passion for truth, for civil liber ties,  the many freedoms  that we at  times take for granted yet he so dearly  believed in, transcended all races. reli gions, creeds or economic status as he  fought for the protection of all human  beings under the law.  He was a national symbol of dignity  and integrity in politics. He embodied  a wisdom and wealth of knowledge,  from his down home country stories to  his quotations from Shakespeare, that  was Unsurpassed in American politics.  He was  truly a national hero who  bridged both the 19th and 20th cen turies  as  he  carried  our Nation  through the dark hours of the Water gate affair. Through his unyielding  search for truth, he helped to diffuse  one of' the most devastating events in  American politics.  As Senator Ervin said at the Water gate hearings some 12 years ago,  in  words which bear repeating today:  And I think that those who participated  in this effort to nullify the laws of man and  the laws of God overlooked one of the laws  of God, which is set forth in the 7th verse of  the 6th chapter of Galatians:  Be not deceived. God is not mocked; for  whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also  reap.  Our Nation has been enriched and  made stronger by all that Senator Sam  was and believed in. He will be sorely  missed.  TRADE STATISTICS HAVE  NEGATIVE CONSUMER IMPACT  <Mrs.  BENTLEY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.>  ",1985
536,662,7,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, in Oc tober of last year, Crompton Inc., the  oldest textile company in the United  States-178 years-filed for a chapter  11 bankruptcy. It was the sole produc er of velveteen in America and one of  the few remaining producers of cordu roy.  In less than 1 year, 1982-83, 2,000  Crompton workers were  laid off  in  three States. Bankruptcy in 1984 laid  off another 2,450 in two more States.  In that same month, October 1984,  the price of velveteen coming from  Japan jumped $1 per yard.  Velveteen fabric may not be vital to  defense, but the profits of making vel , veteen and selling it, the taxes paid by  this company and its workers, and the  ultimate higher price which is being  paid by consumers for products will  prove to be very vital in our future.  It is happening in steel, in machine  tools, and ball bearings, in shoes, and  .'  ",1985
537,675,7,Mr.  MICHEL.," I don't think that it is a diffi cult choice. The Michel option at least  preserves the principle of U.S. support  for the only people in the hemisphere  who are willing to put their lives on  the line, to def end their nation against  those who would pose a Communist  ideology from outside the hemisphere.  The  International Red Cross may  run good refugee camps, but they will  need a  lot more than $14 million,  if  the Communist government in Nicara gua is able to consolidate this power  and  the  remaining  non-Communist  elements are forced  to become refu gees. And the Red Cross is irrelevant if  our objective is to oppose further sub version  and  aggression  in Central  America.  In the final analysis, Mr. Chairman,  if you believe we are faced with a seri ous, Soviet-backed,  threat in Nicara gua, you should def eat  the Barnes Hamilton package, and support  the  Michel substitute.  If you believe, as I do, that the FON  Contra forces are dedicated to defeat ing the Communists and restoring de mocracy to the Nicaraguan revolution,  then you should def eat the Barnes Hamilton proposal.  And finally, if you are truly interest ed  in avoiding even deeper  involve ment of U.S. forces in Central Amer ica, you should vote to help the Nica raguans help themselves. If this House  refuses to go forward with at least hu manitarian aid to the Contras, the ul timate cost to the Nation in terms of  lives and  treasure will be  far more  than $14 million.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1985
538,675,7,Mr. CHENEY.," I yield to the gentle man from Arizona CMr. McCAIN].  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Chairman, I  in tended to take my turn later on but I  think it is very important to point out  the absence of incentive for negotia tions as part of the Barnes-Hamilton  amendment.  There is also a prohibition on mili tary assistance  to Nicaraguan resist ance which remains  in place  in this  amendment.  I think it is very important to hear  what Managua radio Sandino Network  said this morning while they applaud ed the congressional vote last night. I  will only read the last paragraph:  In conclusion,  the Nicaraguan Govern ment wishes to reiterate its firm irreversible  position that it will never accept any kind of  a dialog with the mercenary forces directed  and financed by the United States Govern ment regardless of the pretext to stage this  dialog.

540,675,7,Mr.  FOWLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  regret that my colleague from Wyo ming, Mr. CHENEY, refused to yield for  debate, for what he said deserves to be  answered.  The speech that he read has been  read  in  this Chamber by him and  others many times before. Only the  name of this year's country has been  substituted.  A few years ago I heard the same  speech read by similar spokesmen for  this administration when we were sup porting  a  government  in Ethiopia  against Marxists, as they called them selves, in Somolia. After pursuing this  policy-thought to be in the best inter est of the United States-for a while  we found that events change and now  ironically we are supporting the Somo lians even though Mr. Barre calls him self a Marxist, against  the Commu nists in Ethiopia.  D 1400  I remember when that speech was  read a few years ago by administration  spokesmen about Albania, which was  first a Soviet satellite, second, a Chi nese Communist satellite, and is now  some form of xenophobic nationalism,  I guess, which our country embraces.  I remember when that speech was  read by administration spokesmen in  this body about Algeria,  a  country  that we condemned as Communist, but  to which we are now providing arms  and understanding.  I remember when that speech was  read about the Sudan and Zimbabwe  and Marxist Mozambique, but have  now changed our policies. I remember  too well  the accusations heard here  today. that there is no reconciliation,  no  negotiation  possible;  that  we  cannot find a way to solve our prob lems, eliminate hostile influences, and  to support  the forces of democracy  short of waging war.  I urge my colleagues to put the prob lem of Central America in that per spective  of  recent  history. Central  America  is  important  to  the United  to  States. It is not at this moment vital  to the United States.  But the United States is vital to the  freedom and economic development of  Central America. We can sustain a  better course; 40 Republicans along  with 40 Democrats last night said a  military solution is not the only solu tion and not a bipartisan solution.  The  amendment  offered  by Mr.  BARNES today is first step in achieving  a  sustainable U.S.  foreign policy  in  minimizing hostile influences in Cen tral America. I hope you will support  it.

542,675,7,Mr. HARTNETT.," Mr. Chairman, I  listened yesterday to the debate on a  similar issue to the one we have before  us; and I have tried to listen patiently  today. I guess I consider myself some what more unlike those who are on  the floor here and maybe more like  those who are in the gallery or walk ing around outside in the street.  I do not know a  lot about foreign  policy. I do not known a lot about Al bania and Ethiopia.  I  care because  there are people there, human beings  who have a body and soul. I care for  their well-being. I do not know a lot  about  them,  and  I  guess  to  some  degree I am not as concerned about  them as I am about the people that I  call my fellow Americans here in these  United States.  My colleague that preceded me here  in the well, Mr. CHENEY, rhetorically  asked some questions:  Do you believe that Nicaragua ex ports terrorism?  Do you believe that Nicaragua op presses free speech and religion?  Do you believe that Nicaragua is a  bastion now for Soviet military hard ware and advisers and Cuban advisers?  Do you believe these things?  Do you believe that communism and  Marxism  in  this  hemisphere  is  a  threat to life in the United States the  way we have known it?  My  friends,  if you do not believe  these things then, of course, anything  that I would say today is going to fall  on deaf ears.  If you do not believe that commu nism is a threat to our way of life in  these United States and if stability in  Central America is not of great con cern to these United States, then you  may as well not even be present in this  Chamber.  Do you not think that it is in the  best interests of the United States for  us to have some control of activities in  Central America?

544,688,7,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chair man, Hamilton-Barnes says that the  United States should provide only hu manitarian aid and that this should be  channeled  through  the U.N. High  Commissioner  on Refugees  or  the  International Red Cross,  and  then  only if they should decide to do it to  meet humanitarian needs. These are  respectable organizations, but  there  are respectable U.S. Government orga nizations capable of doing that, too. In  addition,  there are reasons why  the  proposed recipients might not be re ceptive  to  the  two  organizations  named in the amendment.  People familiar with the plight of  those who have fled Sandinista rule  and familiar with the activities of the  UNHCR say this would be a sure way  to weaken and dishearten the regime's  opponents.  Personal testimony comes from Dr.  Othniel J. Seiden, a Denver physician  who spent 3 weeks in Honduras close  to the Nicaraguan border caring for  Miskito Indian victims of the Sandi nista regime. Dr. Seiden was a volun teer sponsored by  the Victoria and  Albert Gildred Foundation for Latin  American Health and Education.  At first he thought he'd work in the  UNHCR refugee camps. But Miskito  leaders in Honduras persuaded him to  come to their own villages where there  were thousands of Nicaraguan Miskito  refugees who desperately needed med ical  care. The Miskito  leaders  ex plained  that  the UNHCR medical  teams refused to go to the villages but  insisted  the  refugees  come  to  the  UNHCR camps. This most of the Indi ans refused to do.  According to Dr. Seiden, the Miskito  refugees  claimed  they were much  better off in the villages of their own  people than in the UNHCR camps.  Working in the villages and in visits  to UNHCR camps, Dr. Seiden found  that all the Miskito leaders said was  true.

545,701,7,Mr. KASICH.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, several weeks ago I  stood on this floor and argued that  America is a good, decent, Just nation.  I said we ought to, as Americans, shed  the guilt that too many Members of  Congress carry on this floor. I said the  ""Blame  America  First""  crowd  is  wrong. I said that we are a good, just,  and decent people and stood on the  high-moral ground and argued  that  the tradition of this country has been  to go to the ends of the Earth to help  people  in need. Whether  they are  hungry. whether  they are  sick,  or  whether they are victims of natural or  manmade disasters, our legacy  is  to  help.  Why do we do it? We do it because  we are good. We do  it to provide a  decent way of life for human beings,  to give them a chance to control their  own lives, to control their own destiny,  to secure them from the Jaws of death  and,  yes,  ladies  and gentleman,  to  secure them from the Jaws of repres sion.  Yes, I made this statement, if you  will recall, as this House voted $1 bil lion in aid to Africa, including aid to  Communist Ethiopia, whose  leaders  have aggravated the problems in their  nation, whose leaders are more inter ested in relocation and more interest ed in resettlement and in consolidating  their power than in feeding starving  people.  In  fact, Communist  leaders  have used trucks that could have car ried grain to starving people to relo cate resisters to their regime in north ern Ethiopia. These  are  the  same  Communist leaders who spent $10 mil lion celebrating the Marxist revolution  while America watched with horror  the tragedy of starving millions who  desperately needed that $10 million in  foodstuffs.  This body has approved aid to Com munist Angola. This body has  ap proved aid to Communist China. This  body has approved aid to Communist  Mozambique and, of course, this body,  believe it or not, has approved in the  past $118 million in aid to the Sandi nistas, until even Jimmy Carter, Amer ica's leading Democrat ostrich, recog nized the repression and called for a  halt.  Is it too much to provide $14 million  in  humanitarian  aid  to  freedom  fighers, people who want to determine  their own destiny, people who want  freedom of the press, people who want  freedom of speech and freedom of reli gion,  like  the Moskito  Indians, who  are willing to fight and die for free dom?

551,714,7,Mr. MINETA.," Mr. Chairman,  the  difference between the two proposals  before us  today  is simple: The first  makes the United States a power for  peace  in  the  region. The substitute  will make us the quartermaster corps  of the Nicaraguan Contras.   The first resolution, just passed, pro vides true refugees with true humani tarian assistance. The substitute gives  the Contras boots, rations, and other  military  assistance-everything  an  army needs save for weapons. They  can  get  those  elsewhere with  the  money they save.  The argument  that somehow our  Nation will have  ""clean hands"" by  giving Contras only the so-called hu manitarian aid just won't wash. The  bottom line is still military support whether you are  the quartermaster  corps or the ordnance corps.  What sort of humanitarian aid can  we expect from  this administration?  With its track record, you will see hu manitarian aid that includes helicop ters outfitted for the medical evacu ation of soldiers. Never mind that the  helicopters may  be  outfitted with  rocket pods purchased from another  source. When  the press  reports on  such actions appear, you can be sure  that the administration will shrug its  shoulders and say, ""We have no con trol over what they do.""

552,714,7,Mr.  SHELBY.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  today's debate has once again high lighted the problems endemic to this  body's exploratory process-a process  which often leads us to be too preoccu pied with  the ""how,"" ""where,"" and  ""what"" rather than the ""why."" This is  understandable. It is easy to focus at tention  on  Contra  human  rights  abuses. It is far more difficult to dwell  on the systemic oppression which has  come  to permeate Nicaraguan socie ty-an oppression which has provided  the  fertile ground from which  the  Contras have spawned.  The Sandinistas have betrayed their  own revolution. They have betrayed  their supporters at home. They have  betrayed  their  supporters  abroad.  Most of all, they have betrayed them selves.  The Sandinista dictatorship is a to talitarian state, and it has done what  all totalitarian states do: it has stifled  both democracy and those who so ably  uphold  its  values-the  press,  the  church, and ultimately the voters.  There are those who say this isn't  America's problem. Why  should  it  matter if Nicaragua is a  totalitarian  state? Well,  this seems  to beg  the  question. Free elections, I've been told,  are a  rare commodity in totalitarian  states. Dissent is a precarious occupa tion. Ask Mr. Castro's political oppo nents what they 'think about Cuban  political debate.  Mr. Chairman, democratic states do  not attack their neighbors. Democratic  states do not readily carry out war.  Democratic states, as we well know,  are reluctant to spend a great deal of  money on arms. In short, democratic  states are not, nor will they ever be a  threat to the free world.  The Contras are not angels. There  are certainly objectionable elements  among  their ranks. But as Winston  Churchill once said: ""Democracy is the  worst system in the world except for  all of  the others."" For all of  their  faults, the Contras are far preferable  to the alternative-the alternative of  millions of ""foot people"" fleeing possi ble  totalitarian  states  in  Central  America,  the alternative of our bor ders  being overrun  by millions  of  hungry refugees who only desire  to  live in peace, and the alternative of  Soviets satellite governments  sitting  astride the Rio Grande.  Closing our eyes and wishing  the  threat away may temporarily work in  Afghanistan, but to abrogate our duty  here  in our own backyard does not  bode well for the future of a nation  such as ours.  Vote to aid the Contras.e  e ",1985
553,714,7,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman,  al though I initially voted for the Hamil ton substitute amendment  to House  Joint Resolution 247, I cannot in good  faith support the final passage of this  resolution. I agree with the principles  offered by Representative Hamilton's  substitute amendment prohibiting aid  to the Contras, yet providing both hu manitarian aid and support for the re gional  peace negotiations. However,  last night, the Senate passed its own  version of this resolution, and agreed  to  the Reagan  administration's  re quest to give the Contras $14 million  in aid to continue the covert war in  Nicaragua. Our two resolutions are at  opposite ends, and I am not convinced  that a compromise can be reached be tween the House and the Senate ver sions that will provide the necessary  safeguards to end terrorism and vio lence  in Nicaragua and achieve our  common goals of peace, internal recon ciliation, regional security, and democ racy. I am,  therefore, voting against  this resolution.  Our  decision whether  to  provide  funds to the Contras will have a pro found influence on the shape and di rection of our foreign policy not only  in Nicaragua and Central America but  throughout the world. I strongly be lieve  that only  through diplomatic  channels and regional negotiations in volving the Sandinistas, the Contadora  countries and the United States, can a  peaceful solution be found to end the  raging conflict in Nicaragua that has  destroyed thousands of innocent men,  women, and children.  Last night,  I voted against House  Joint Resolution  239, which would  fund the Contras, encourage covert ac tivity aimed at overthrowing the San dinista  government  and  undermine  American foreign policy in the region.  I  also voted against  the  substitute  amendment offered by Representative  MICHEL that provides $14 million in as sistance to the Contras, to be distrib uted by the U.S. Agency for Interna tional Development. We should have  learned from our painful experiences  in Vietnam-American  expansionism  will not bring peace or an end to the  undeclared war in Nicaragua.  Even if the United States could over throw the Sandinistas by funding the  Contras, America's credibility and re solve for democratic principles would  be forever compromised in the eyes of  our allies throughout the world.  Even if the Reagan administration  could convince  the American people  that the Contras were,  indeed,  free dom  fighters who are  risking  their  lives to def eat communism and install  democracy in Nicaragua, rather than a  band of  terrorists and  international  criminals,  still  the United  States  would set a dangerous precedent. The  administration  is  fomenting political  instability, rather than seeking peace ful means to the end of respect for  human rights, democracy, and coop eration in the region.  Even  if the administration demon strated that Nicaragua and the Mana gua regime is a threat to the United  States, it would not justify these ac tions which are clearly seen as illegal  and immoral in the world community  and the World Court.  The Reagan administration claims  not to inter! ere in the internal affairs  of other countries, but seeks an  in volvement which is neither justifiable  or realistic in promoting the cause of  freedom and democracy. If we  truly  wish to promote the cause of justice  and freedom, we must use the weapons  of diplomacy, dialog, and political de termination, not the hired guns of the  Contras.  I  agree with my  colleagues-and  hundreds of constituents who have  written to me in recent months-that  resuming aid to the Contras will sabo tage any chance of peacefully resolv ing the conflict in Nicaragua; will pro long suffering and bloodshed; and will  serve  to  strengthen,  rather  than  weaken the worst elements of the San dinista regime.  Mrs. LLOYD, Mr. Chairman, I want  to rise and say a few words in support  of the Michel amendment.

555,727,7,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, I am pleased to join my colleague,  the gentleman from New York, in in troducing the Space Tax Investment  Equity Act of 1985.  This bill  illustrates  the  foresight  necessary if we are to be prepared for  this next economic frontier for Amer ica. Current law does not allow equip ment that is used  in outer space  to  apply the investment tax credit, accel erated depreciation, or  the research  and  development  tax  credit  to  its  value. Companies like Grumman, Fair child, McDonnell Douglas,  and 3M,  who plan to begin manufacturing in  space, are  facing obvious extra ex pense because of this tax differential.  This barrier is unintentional and will  prove to be counterproductive.  Our bill would extend  the  invest ment tax credit, the accelerated depre ciation tax benefits, and the R&D tax  credit to those companies whose place  of business  is  in outer space rather  than here on Earth  in  the United  States. When we first began the early  flights into space, we did not antici pate that space would become a place  of business. We must remove this un intended tax before these businesses  are lost to the American economy. In vestments  in space activities already  must  compete with  those here on  Earth in the United States-as well as  with those investments international ly, and it is clear that we will be facing  stiff  competition,  particularly  from  the  the Germans, and  the French,  Japanese.  This  legislation will  assure  that  space ventures are treated essentially  the same as Earth ventures under our  tax code. Clearly,  the age of space  commerce has dawned. Space will be  the arena for expanding commercial  activity including communications sat ellites, upper stage systems, industrial  and scientific experiments, and manu facturing. Private investment in these  commercial enterprises is able to take  advantage of the unique characteris tics of space, such as vacuum, micro gravity, and radiation.  We can produce rare medicines with  the potential of saving thousands of  lives and hundreds of millions of dol lars; we can manufacture superchips  that can build space observatories ena bling scientists to see out to the edge  of the universe; and we can produce  special alloys and biological materials  that benefit greatly from zero gravity  environment.  To foster these exciting embryonic  industries, we must pave the way by  eliminating obstructions and allowing  these industries to compete at least on  an equal footing with those already  here on Earth. I would urge the early  passage of this legislation.e  ORDER OF BUSINESS  ",1985

561,727,7,Mr. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, all of  us who are privileged to serve in this  House represent districts that include  special points of historical  interest,  and each of us is rightfully proud of  these widely varied ""treasures."" And  in a nation whose history is as rich and as fresh-as is ours, it is not surprising that our countryside is dotted  with scores of historical m~rkers, mu seums, and places with names  that  ""ring bells"" to those of us who care  about the heritage we share.  However, among these many treas ures, there are a handful of small, un assuming communities which, by their  very existence, preserve those key mo ments  in history when a small step  was taken that would, in the wisdom  of hindsight, be recognized as a  tre mendous stride. And when these spe cial places have been maintained and  carecj  for properly,  they provide us  with a resource we can never afford to  lose. They give us-the heirs of histo ry-living  reminders  that what we  have today has not always been here.  They prove to us that the events, the  beginnings, and the ""great moments""  we all learn about from the pages of  books really happened.  Here  in  the Nation's Capital, we  have many such places. We can take  our children to Ford's Theater, for ex ample, and point to the spot where  President  Lincoln  was  mortally  wounded-and in doing so, we give our  children an opportunity to really un derstand,  to really feel  that a great  moment in history truly happened.  With that experience, our children's  history books and the references they  hear to events of -the past come alive.  They become tangibly related to what  we are witnessing and doing  today.  And that, Mr. Speaker, is something to  which we  can never affix  a  finite  value.  In the Eighth Congressionai District  of Missouri, which I am honored to  represent, there is a small, quiet com munity where just such an invaluable  experience is today possible-and pos sible in a truly remarkable way.  The name of this community is Ste.  Genevieve-and if that name is famil iar to you, it is because Ste. Genevieve,  MO, is the ""Mother City of the West,""  the first permanent settlement on the  west bank of the Mississippi River.  To  those of us  in Congress who  spend most of our days working with  the problems and challenges of our  Nation's  continuing  progress,  the  ""moment in history"" that Ste. Gene vieve represents is one of obvious im portance. On that day in the  l 730's  when a small group of French colo nists established a settlement across  the river from ""Old Kaskaskia,"" they  probably didn't realize that their deci sion would later be cited as the begin ning of the great westward expansion.  No, these first settlers were undoubt edly  lured across  the  river by  the  area's incredibly rich farm land, not  by a desire to make history or open  the door to the vast upper Louisiana  Territory and the rich lands beyond.

562,740,7,Mr.  FRANK.," Mr. Speaker,  today  this body commemorates the Armeni an genocide, a  tradition we began in  1964. Seventy years have passed since  this  terrible crime against humanity  took place, an event which  is com memorated in ceremonies throughout  this  country  and  the world.  I  am  deeply saddened to find that there are  people who would have us forget this  tragedy. I do not believe in collective  guilt, in the idea that the sins of the  fathers are visited on the sons. I do be lieve, however, that it is only by a con scious act of memory that we can pre vent a recurrence of such horrifying  event.  I would like to enter into the RECORD  a letter I received from His Excellen cy,  the Turkish Ambassador Sukru  Elekdag, and my response to him.  The letter follows:  TuRKISH EMBASSY,  Washington, DC, March 21, 1985.  BARNEY FRANK,  House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. FRANK: It is my understanding  that you are being asked to lend your name  and support to  two resolutions which, al though  seemingly  innocuous, would  be  seized upon as encouragement for interna tional terrorists allied with those who just a  few days ago, on March 12, killed a Canadi  an security guard while storming the resi dence of the Turkish ambassador to Canada  in Ottawa.  I refer to H.J. Res. 37 and H.J. Res. 192  which would designate April 24, 1985, as a  ""National Day of Remembrance of Man's  Inhumanity  to Man"" and which embrace  claims that Armenians .vere the victims of  genocide in Turkey 70 years ago-the stated  pretext for the Ottawa terrorist attack.  Passage would be a severe setback to our  common efforts to stamp our international  terrorism. I hope your consideration of the  effects of passage of these resolutions will  lead you to withhold your support.  The March 12 attack by terrorists calling  themselves members of the ""Armenian Rev olutionary Army"" <ARA>  resulted  in  the  death of a  ~anadian, severe injury to Am  bassador Coskun Kirca, and hours of terror  to his wife and daughter and 10 other per sons held hostage until rescued by Canadian  authorities. It was the latest incident in an  11-year rampage of assassins claiming mem bership in Armenian terrorist organizations,  in which they have murdered 41 Turkish  diplomats and members of  their families  and some 30 innocent bystanders, including  Americans. Several attacks have occurred  here in the United States.  The Ottawa murderers echoed the pretext  of their fellow terrorists that this senseless  shedding  of  innocent  blood  constitutes  ""vengeance"" for what they allege was geno cide practiced on Armenian subjects of the  Ottoman Empire 70 years ago. A supporter  interviewed on Canadian television the next  day tried to cloak the raid in respectability  by calling the terrorist activities ""a fight for  freedom  . . . a  just cause <with> no  time  limit.""  Every semblance of respectability is seized  upon by international terrorists as justifica tions for  their taking of innocent human  life. Seeming acceptance by the Congress of  these pretexts for terrorism will be claimed  by the terrorists and their supporters as a  victory for their vicious campaign of blood shed. Moreover,  it will fuel the irrational  hatred  that permits calculating  terrorist  operatives to convert impressionable Arme nian youths into murderers of innocents in  1985-murders in ""retribution"" for errone ously  interpreted  tragedies 70  years ago  that suffering to all ethnic groups in Anato lia.  All people of good will  throughout the  world are gratefully aware of American ab horrence of terrorism and championship of  justice and the sanctity of human life, and  have joined in sympathy toward Americans  who have been the innocent victims of ter rorist assassins.  I sincerely hope that you and your col leagues in the Congress will refuse to allow  your good will to be unintentionally distort ed into a prize for those who shed the blood  of  innocents  to publicize  their ""cause.""  I  equally hope you will also take into consid  eration the Turkish people's extreme sensi tivity and strong reaction to being slandered  by Armenian activists. I look forward to our  continuing common commitment to stamp  out  terrorism and common effort  toward  the safeguarding of Q.,uman lives from the  attacks of assassins.  Sincerely,  Ambassador of the Turkish Republic.  SUKRU ELEKDAG,  CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, April 5, 1985.  His Excellency SUKRU ELEKDAG,  Embassy of the Republic of Turkey,  Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR: I found your letter  of March 21st offensive.  I deeply  resent  your attempt to equate support for my col league  Tony  Coelho's  bill  condemning  ""Man's Inhumanity to Man"" with support  for terrorism. I am proud to be a cosponsor  of this legislation. I have been a vocal critic  of terrorism, including atrocities committed  by American extremists. This does not pre vent me from recognizing the legitimate his  torical grievances of the Armenian people.  If you are serious about international co operation  to prevent  terrorism,  I would  strongly recommend that you refrain from  such rhetoric-it only detracts from our ef forts.  Thank you for your attention.  BARNEY FRANK.  When Hitler embarked on his final  solution,  he  claimed  that  people's  memories were short, that no one re membered the Armenian genocide.

563,740,7,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Speaker, as a  cosponsor of House Joint Resolution  192, I rise today with a great number  of my colleagues who have joined to gether to mark the anniversary of the  million and a half Armenians who suf fered so greatly at the hands of the  Ottoman empire. Tragically, these in dividuals were put  to death  for no  other reason than their ethnic and re ligious convictions.  Without  question,  the Armenian  genocide  is an affront  to all decent  people who value the gift of human  life. Because of our moral values and  commitment to human dignity, it re quires us to speak out about the truth  of this dark episode in our world's his tory.  On April 22, 1981, President Reagan  stated that ""the lessons of the geno cide of the Armenians must never be  forgotten."" I strongly share the Presi dent's desire  to express concern for  anyone who has ever had the misf or tune of being subjected to the cruelty  of tyrants.  Let me be clear that the purpose of  those of us who speak out for people  of Armenian descent, do so not be cause we seek to inflame hatred, or  that we desire a chill in relations with  the present Government of Turkey.  On the contrary, we do so because we  are compelled to eliminate racial and  religious hatred from our lives.  Mr. Speaker, the Armenian terrorist  groups who receive front page cover  for their bombing and killings of Turk ish diplomats do not  represent my  California constituents of Armenian  descent. On the contrary, the majority  of the 6.5 million Armenians today do  not condone  terrorism  in any way.  Nor, however, will  they ever accept  any distortion of what the true histor ical facts are.  I commend everyone associated with  this special order today, and hope this  body will call for the immediate con sideration of House Joint Resolution  192 .   ,   ",1985
564,753,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Let me say one  thing first, and then I will yield to the  distinguished  gentleman  from New  York.  When Qadhafi had his 15th anniver sary party in Libya,  the Nicaraguan  Communists sent their No. 2 man to  be there because they wanted to let  him know that, as much a terrorist as  he was, they were right in there as ter rorists with him.  So I say to every person who cares  for freedom, whether it is freedom in  American or freedom in Israel or free dom in Central America, that Niemol ler was right, that you have to care  that  the people who happen  to be  Jewish are able  to  live  free  in  the  Middle East,  that you have  to care  that  the people who happen  to be  Catholic are free in Central America,  and you have to care that the people  of any background, of any race or reli gion, are able to be free in their home land. So the cause of a free Nicaragua  is  in that sense the cause of a  free  Israel and is in that sense the cause of  a free America.  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to yield now  to the gentleman from New York.  Mr. ECKERT of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding, and I am glad he  made that point.  I heard some of the gentleman's re marks as  I was  in  the office doing  some work, and I am glad to hear him  touch on those points. But is  it not  true that on Qadhafi's 15th anniversa ry party that he threw for himself, not  only did Nicaragua send representa tion, but is it not true that no Arab  leaders attended?  ",1985
565,753,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," That is right. The  Nicaraguans were more  aggressively  pro-Libya and pro-Qadhafi and proter ror than any of the major Arab coun tries.  D 2130  Mr. ECKERT of New York. Another  point  I wish  the gentleman would  elaborate on is the PLO connection in  Managua. Is it not true that in Mana gua, Nicaragua, that there is an em bassy  for  the PLO, which  is not a  country, it is a terrorist organization?  ",1985
566,753,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," That  is  correct.  The Communist government of Nica ragua recognized the Palestinian Lib eration Otganization  as  soon  as  it  could and pledged its solidarity to the  Palestinian Liberation Organization,  which means, of course, that the Com munist government of Nicaragua  is  committed to the destruction of Israel.  Mr. ECKERT of New York. I cannot  think of another country that comes  quickly  to mind that recognizes  the  PLO as an embassy, that has ambassa dorial status. It is an unusual move for  a country.  Mr: GINGRICH.  I am not sure  if  Communist countries routinely in gen er~l do that or not. I would be very  careful. A.gain, we might want to ask  our  friends on  the Western Hemi sphere Subcommittee how many coun tries recognize the Palestinian Libera tion Organization as an official gov ernment or an official movement.  Mr. ECKERT of New York. It cer tainly would show the sentiment.  ",1985

569,753,7,Mr. WALKER.," You know, what our  friends on the left will  tell us,  they  think that is horrible. I mean,  they  come out here and they say on the  floor that they think that is just terri ble, that the Sandinistas are in fact  recognizing the PLO and that they are  anti-Semitic. They came  to the well  and said that. They said they are terri bly disturbed about all  those things  down there. They are just not willing  to do anything about it.  They do not say that. I am saying  that. The fact is that they use all that  language, but when it comes down to  the fact of are you willing to do some thing,  like  support  the Contras, or  anything, they do not.  The fact is, as we pointed out here  earlier, they are not willing to do any thing, and that is the problem.  Mr. ECKERT of New York. Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman.

In 1979, two-thirds of the people in  Latin America  lived under military  governments, or governments domi nated by the military. Today, however,  that situation has changed dramatical ly. Over 90 percent of those people are  living under democratic governments.

572,779,7,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to call attention to the plight of  Soviet Jews.  Jewish emigration has declined dra matically in recent years from 51,000  in 1979 to less than 1,000 in 1984. De spite the change in Soviet leadership  and the resumption of arms control  negotiations, Soviet mistreatment of  Jews and refuseniks continues unabat ed.  Sadly, we  in Congress have  little  direct leverage with which to persuade  the Soviet leadership to abandon its  campaign of harassment and intimida tion.  We can, however, call international  attention to the unjust treatment of  these people by bringing to light the  cases  of  individual  refuseniks  and  their families.  One such case is that of Isaac and  Sophie Kogan. I was first made aware  of the problems facing Isaac Kogan  and his family when a constituent of  mine contacted me during a  recent  visit to Washington by members of the  Student Coalition for Soviet Jewry.  Kogan, a refusenik from Leningrad,  first applied  for permission  to emi grate from the Soviet Union in 1974.  His  request was denied for security  reasons. Yet 2 years earlier, Kogan  had voluntarily resigned his position  at an electronics factory, for which he  was trained, to work as a manual la borer on  the Leningrad  railroad  in  order to avoid any connection with se curity work.  In August 1976, Kogan  was again denied a visa, this time with  a warning: ""You will crumble before  you get out."" Ten years later, Isaac  Kogan is working as a delivery man  and still trying to get out of the Soviet  Union. Even though he has not been  in a profession which would make him  privy to anything dealing with govern ment  security,  the  authorities  still  refuse to allow him and his family to  leave because of security reasons.  Mr. Speaker, we must continue  to  communicate and publicize our dissat isfaction to the Soviet leadership  in  hopes  that public pressure will per suade Soviet authorities to end their  oppressive  treatment  of  Soviet  Jewry.e  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

573,792,7,Mr. STANGELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  the Reagan administration has provid ed Congress with a 1985 farm bill pro posal  that would be disastrous  for  Minnesota farmers. Under the banner  of market orientation, the administra tion's plan calls for pain, not profit,  for American agriculture.  On the other hand, there are those  who wishfully think the answer to all  of  agriculture's  problems  will  be  achieved by merely cutting back our  production. What do  they think we  have been doing? While we have im plemented  supply management pro grams  in 5 of the last 6 years, our  export  competitors  have  expanded  both acreage and production. At the  same time, our world export market  share  in wheat has dropped  from  almost one-half  to about one-third  while  our export  competitors have  gained by the same amount.  Both of these approaches would put  American agriculture on a sure fire  course for self-destruction. Sometime  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  down the road the Reagan administra tion's proposal would certainly make  our exports price competitive-but it  would be a joyless victory after count ing the number of farmers who would  be sacrificed in the process. There is  also no question that strict mandatory  production controls would ultimately  raise  farm prices. But would  it be  worth laying idle 40 to 50 percent of  the  richest cropland  in  the world?  Saying goodbye  to our hard earned  export markets? Dashing any hopes  for significant market growth in the  future? Adding American agriculture  to the list of slowly dying U.S. indus tries  that  have  already  conceded  def eat to foreign competition?  The Reagan administration's farm  bill proposal isn't truly market orient ed because it doesn't call for our Gov ernment to fight as hard for our farm ers in the world market as other gov ernments  fight  for  their  farmers.  Those who only advocate strict man datory production controls want  to  give up without even trying to fight  back.  Farmers aren't quitters. Most have  had  to  fight  for everything  they've  got. I think they just want to see our  Government start implementing poli cies  that work  for  them  instead of  against them.  It's about  time  our Government  commit itself to matching foreign gov ernments subsidy for subsidy. The cor nerstone of this year's market-orient ed farm bill should be to immediately  transfer the pain of unfair trade poli cies from our farmers to those govern ments, both  foreign  and our own,  which are guilty of creating agricul ture's problems.  WHEAT, FEED GRAINS TITLE  MARKET-ORIENTED LOAN  The market-oriented loan is a con cept which, if implemented, would im mediately make our exports price com petitive and still protect farm income.  Under the market-oriented loan plan,  commodity loan rates would be main tained for the 1986 crop at the 1985  levels. However, farmers could sell the  crop under loan at any time during  the 9-month  loan period and would  only be required to repay based upon  the world market price. The farmer  would pocket the difference between  the loan rate and the repayment rate.  The market-oriented loan approach  has two overriding advantages. First of  all, it protects farm income. By main taining the loan rate at the 1985 crop  level, farm prices and income will not  suffer as they would under the admin istration's proposal.  Second, and of greater importance in  the long run, it significantly reduces  Government involvement in the grain  business. For years, both our export  competitors and grain-buying nations  have taken advantage of us because we  have pursued agricultural policies that  have made us the world's great stockApril 24, 1985  piler and residual supplier. Our will ingness to hold grain has allowed our  export competitors to gradually chip  away an ever  larger portion of our  world market share. In addition, it en courages foreign consuming nations to  buy hand to mouth and simply let us  worry about holding reserve stocks. In  recent years,  this policy has dearly  cost our farmers in both lost markets  and lower prices.  By moving this grain into commer cial channels instead of continuing to  allow  surplus stocks hang over  the  market and depress prices, the follow ing are just a few of the positive re sults  that would occur: burdensome  surplus stocks would be removed, for eign governments would  incur enor mous costs for continuing their export  subsidies, our grain would immediately  be price  competitive  in  the export  market, lost foreign markets could be  regained, farm income would be pro tected, and the groundwork would be  laid to ensure our farmers will fully  benefit in the future from American  agriculture's comparative advantage in  the world market.  The market-oriented loan will allow  American agriculture's transition to a  truly market-oriented,  and market winning, approach without the devas tating consequences that would other wise occur under the administration's  plan.  The market-oriented loan then can  be viewed as a cushioning tool to get  us where we need to go without throw ing farmers off the farm in the proc ess. Also,  its ability  to  immediately  make our exports price competitive  should  improve  the prospects  for a  much quicker  turnaround  in world  commodity prices by discouraging pro duction in competitor nations and en hancing demand.  TARGET PRICES  In addition to the marketing loan,  target prices should continue to be uti lized to maintain farm income.  Target  prices  for  the  1986  crop  would be set at the national average  cost of production,  including returns  to land. The cost of production deter mination would have to be approved  by the National Agricultural Cost of  Production Standards Review Board made up of producers representing all  regions of  the country-but  in any  case may not be set at less than $4. 75  per bushel for wheat and $3.45 per  bushel  for  corn. Target prices  for  other feed grains would be set at a  level which is fair and reasonable in  relation to corn.  Many believe that the structure of  past  farm  programs-with  benefits  tied directly to the amount a farmer  produces-has actually worked to dis courage our efforts to control overpro duction.

574,805,7,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  today I am reintroducing a bill to alle viate the continuing problems created  by anticompetitive and anticonsumer  warranties contained in the Clean Air  Act.  First, it would limit production and  performance warranties on emission  systems  to 2 years/24,000 miles and  make sure the list of parts covered is  not subsequently expanded. It would  specifically  limit  the 5 year/50,000mile warranty to the catalytic convert er,  the  thermal  reactor,  and parts  solely used for emissions control. EPA  would retain the right to recall emis sion system failures for 5 years/50,000  miles.  Second,  it  further  increases  competition by repealing the counter productive parts certification program  and by doing away with the waiver  that  allows  auto manufacturers  to  specify the use of one of their own  parts. Third,  it permits  independent  California  auto  parts  dealers  and  repair  shops  to operate under  the  same  warranty  requirements  that  apply in other States. And finally, it  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  clarifies the antitampering provisions  of the law.  In  1977,  Congress  amended  the  Clean Air Act  to protect  the small  businessman and the consumer from  anticompetitive emissions warranties.  Parts  to be warranted  for  the ex tended period were  limited to  those  that are installed primarily to control  emissions.  EPA expanded the list of parts cov ered by the warranty through regula tions. The Automotive Service Indus try Association CASIAl and the Auto motive Parts Rebuilders Association  CAPRAl  filed suit  in 1980, asserting  that the regulations were contrary to  the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.  In a separate action, vehicle manufac turers and importers filed suit on the  warranty  and  certification matters,  and included a legal objection to the  short test regulations issued by EPA.  The court ordered consolidation of the  cases, forcing joint consideration of af termarket and vehicle manufacturer  issues.  Prior to final court arguments, ASIA  and APRA presented to EPA a techni cal  report  by  Packer Engineering  which  analyzed  the  specific  parts  under  consideration,  the  particular  performance objectives of such parts  and the historical nature of their use.  Based on this report and other inf or mation supplied to EPA by ASIA and  APRA,  a  tentative  consensus was  reached which would have substantial ly limited the parts subject to the ex tended  5  year /50,000-mile  perform ance warranty  The court recognized that Congress  did in fact act to reduce the anticom petitive effects of a broad coverage/  long length warranty in 1977. Howev er, it accepted the EPA interpretation  that the warranty coverage  for  the  first 2 years/24,000 miles was for all  components affecting emissions. With  respect  to  coverage  after 2 years/  24,000 miles, the court avoided a direct  decision on  the correctness of  the  parts list  issued by EPA. The court  stated that the parts list was advisory  only  and  therefore not  subject  to  attack.  The court did not disturb the liber ties taken by EPA in misinterpreting  the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air  Act. EPA regulations provide that not  only sole or primary parts must be  warranted, but also secondary parts  which fail because of a failed primary  part. The court's decision on the certi fication issues transformed a congres sional edict to provide a program to  avoid monopoly into one which actual ly creates an anticompetitive situation  worse than would occur if no such pro gram were instituted.  EPA regulations provide that an af termarket manufacturer who certifies  parts is liable for all costs incurred by  a vehicle manufacturer caused by the  failure of that certified part. One issue  9343  before the court was how this liability  was to be assumed. EPA regulations  required  reimbursement without de tailing how such reimbursement was  to be effected.  The court ruled that EPA must pro vide some forum for resolution of re imbursement disputes. Certifiers must,  as a condition of certification, agree to  such a  reimbursement scheme. The  court discussed the vehicle manufac turer's demand that parts manufactur ers be required to post a bond to estab lish financial stability to actually per form  under  such  a  reimbursement  scheme and in a concurring opinion  that should strike terror in the heart  of every  small business, one  judge  went so far as to state that parts man ufacturers should be required by EPA  to post a bond in order to be certified  and that: ""The criticism that some af termarket parts manufacturers might  not be able to afford to post bond may  be correct, but, it is just those manu facturers who could not afford to post  a bond who need to be weeded out.""  All administrative and  legal  reme dies available to the independent af termarket have now been pursued.  Corrective legislation to put competi tion back into the law is needed. Such  legislation must clearly  remove  the  power of EPA to twist the intent of  Congress.  Mr. Speaker, this is an ever growing  problem  and,  from what  southern  California  independent garages have  shown me, it amounts to an extensive  loss of business. In the 97th Congress I  offered two bills dealing with this sub ject and one of them was almost com pletely incorporated into the compre hensive clean air bill, H.R. 5252, con sidered by the Energy and Commerce  Committee. Unfortunately the meas ure did not become law because of the  difficulty in resolving other issues. In  the 98th Congress I introduced a simi lar measure which I hoped might be  the solution to the problem. For all  States,  including California,  the bill  would have  reduced  the production  and  performance warranties  to  2  years/24,000 miles  for all emissions  system parts.  Mr. Speaker, we are confronted with  yet another example of good  inten tions gone astray. All of us want clean er air, but the adverse effects of these  warranties on the aftermarket and the  consuming public cannot be justified  or overlooked. They must be  taken  into account  if we are  interested in  preserving competition and an impor tant sector of the small business com munity. The legislation I have intro duced today will restore and preserve  that competition and, in the long run,  provide the best guarantee of protec tion that consumers can have.

April 23, 1985 marks the 350th  birthday of the Boston Latin School,  the oldest public school in the United  States of America.  The Latin School was founded by  the town of Boston and has been in  continuous existence since 1635.  Its  founders shared the belief of the an cient Greeks that the only good things  in life are good of the soul. From its  earliest origins, the Latin School has  taught  its scholars dissent with  re sponsibility and has encouraged that  climate. Today, the Latin School es pouses a curriculum that is centered in  the humanities to over 2,300 full-time  students. Without a doubt, this insti tution stands for all that is valued in  our educational system as it continues  to equip Boston area youths with the  knowledge necessary to make a posi tive contribution to our society.  In recognition of the 350th anniver sary of the Boston Latin School, the  U.S. Postal Service is unveiling a com memorative  stamp  celebrating  the  public school education  this Friday,  April 26, 1985, at the Boston Latin  School. Fully 165 million of  these  stamps will be  issued, sending a  re mirider of the contribution of public  education into homes and businesses  in this country and throughout the  world.  As a Member of Congress from the  city of Boston, I am proud to offer my  congratulations  to  the Boston Latin  School on this happy anniversary, and  to wish her continued distinction and  success in the future.e  TRIBUTE TO GEN.

MY Pl.EDGE TO AMERICA  VFW VOICE OF DEMOCRACY SCHOLARSHIP  PROGRAM  <California Winner, Jeffrey Chance, 5940  Intervale Drive, Riverside, CA. 92506)  ""Thanks for the Memory"". Who can listen  to this refrain and not think of Bob Hope?  ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""? Judy Gar land. When Debbie Boone steps on stage, an  orchestra plays, ""You Light Up My Life"". In  the minds of many people, these songs sym bolize the person associated with the song  and symbolize their life, their achievements.  Songs, too, can symbolize countries. ""The  Star Spangled Banner"" and ""America the  Beautiful"" symbolize the United States, our  values and what we as a country stand for.  If I could choose one song  to symbolize  Americans, not collectively, but as individ uals, I would choose the song, ""The Impossi ble Dream"". My pledge to America is that I  will make this song my theme-that I will  live the impossible dream.  The American dream of a better, more  productive, happy life is not an impossible  dream. Americans have made  it possible.  Not  only  have Americans  achieved  the  dream. They  have  inspired  the  dream.  Throughout history, people of other nations  have flocked  to the shores of the United  States  in search of an impossible dream.  They  have made  their  dreams  reality.  Today, dreams are  just as achievable as  they were when our forefathers signed a  constitution guaranteeing freedom for the  pursuit of life, liberty and happiness.  In the song, ""The Impossible Dream"", the  lyrics speak of a person who fights for the  right and reaches for unreachable stars. I  am proud to be a part of a nation whosein dividuals fight for the right. I am grateful  for those who went before to reach unrea chable stars. Doubt said, ""Impossible"". But  early  astronauts  said,  ""Possible,""  and  walked on the moon.  The lyrics continue, "". . . to run where the  brave dare not go"". Americans have contin ually walked untrodden paths-paths  to  great heights, accomplishing great dreams.  Jonas Salk dreamed of a vaccine that would  someday cure polio and prolong life for mil lions. Martin Luther King, Jr., dreamed and  inspired a dream of harmony and equality  within America's ethnic groups. Obstacles  fall when Americans reach for their dreams.  Dreamers have made the United States the  nation that it is. Dreamers among our youth  must continue to make the nation strong, to  solve problems that today have no solutions;  to bring peace when peace seems impossible.  Our country is a nation of goal setters and  dreamers. But setting the goal and dream ing the dream is not enough. We must take  action consistent with our goals. Whether as  an individual or a group, we must work with  diligence to achieve our dreams. But dream,  we must. America is in danger of losing the  dream. There are those who continue to say,  ""Impossible"". Youth must say, ""Possible"".  We cannot, must not, will not give in to de spair, to defeat or to fear. We must continue  to dream, for as one man or woman achieves  a dream, a nation benefits-a new medica tion, an improved technology, an opportuni ty, another era of peace. We must continue  to inspire the dream-to make the impossi ble, possible  for  the  largest number of  people. We must share the products of our  dreams.  9369  My pledge to America is that I will contin ue  the pattern set by my forefathers  to  pursue my own dream, being careful to take  responsibility  for  the action  that makes  dreams come true. I pledge to inspire the  dream,  to reach to the downtrodden,  the  temporarily defeated, those who have lost  faith. I pledge to encourage youth to take  action, to take advantage of the educational,  social and political opportunities of  this  country that put feet to our dreams.  In the words of Ruth Stafford Peale, ""I  will stand up to be counted among those  millions of Americans who have  learned  that Liberty is responsibility"".  I will dream an  impossible dream and  reach that dream, that someday the world  will be a better place because I have lived  and I have dreamed.   REAR ADM. FREDERICK P.

Schu bert, USCG, whose headquarters is in  my congressional district, will retire at  the end of next month.  While  I  certainly  respect Admiral  Schubert's decision, as he has served  his Nation as a Coast Guard officer for  33 years, I personally regret it as it  means that we will be losing his serv ices in the 11th Coast Guard District.  It does not seem possible that he has  already been in command for 2 years.  During this 2-year span of time Ad miral Schubert  certainly  has  been  busy. Probably one of his most de manding tasks was directing the Coast  Guard's preparation for the summer  games of the XXIIId Olympiad. The  Coast Guard was responsible for port  safety and security, yachting venue se curity, dignitary protection, and explo sive ordnance disposal. As we are all  well aware of the smooth and incident free manner  in which the Olympics  were conducted, I  think it is evident  that Admiral Schubert did an out standing job-even though most of his  work was beyopd the public eye.  During his time with the llth Coast  Guard District, he also served as Pacif ic Region Coordinator of the National  Narcotics Border Interdiction System.  In this capacity, he worked with other  Federal and local agencies serving on  the Vice President's Task Force on  Narcotics  Interdiction with  the mis sion of preventing the smuggling of il legal drugs into the Western United  States, and apprehending those who  attempted  to do  so.

580,844,7,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  come today to commend my colleagues  who have joined in supporting Nation al Organ Donor Awareness Week,  which we recognize this week. I also  heartily commend the many citizens  and organziations who will  take this  opportunity to spread the word of how  we all can ""make a miracle.""  We have all heard on the news the  pleas by desperate families with sad eyed children who must have organ  transplants  if  they are  to  live. We  have had our hearts warmed by the  success stories when people are given a  second chance at life because of an  organ transplant. But we seldom see  the  stories  about  the  children  for  whom time ran out-the children who  should have  lived, could have  lived,  but never  received  the organs  they  needed.  I know about  the heartbreak,  the  frustration, the sense of helplessness  because I shared that experience with  a small child, Ashley Bailey, and her  family who live  in my district. Born  with biliary artesia, Ashley fought for  more than a year to hold on to life  until a proper liver could be located  for transplantation. During that time  there  surely were many  potential  donors who  could have  shared  life  with Ashley. But  like millions  .of  Americans,  their  families were not  aware of the need for organ donors,  and  tragically, Ashley died waiting.  During 1984, only an estimated 3,000  out of 23,000 potential donors actually  donated their organs and tissues. That  means that in addition to the loss of  the potential donors' lives, thousands  of waiting recipients met death need lessly.  It's obvious  that  organ  donation  helps save and improve  the  lives of  others .. what is sometimes less obvious  is that donation can diminish the suf fering and grief caused by the sudden,  unexpected death of the donor. In a  tragedy that seems meaningless, organ  donation can provide some meaning  for the grieving survivors.  Medical technology has given us the  ability  to do miraculous  things, but  that can occur only if each individual  makes the miracle happen. With the  memory of all those individuals who  never  received  the  transplants  they  needed, and for  the sake of all  the  people who will yet need transplants  in the future, I urge each Member of  Congress to take this opportunity to  encourage  all  constituents  to  sign  donor cards and notify their friends  and relatives of their desire to ""make  a miracle.""   EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT  HON. DONALD J. PEASE  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 24, 1985  ",1985
581,844,7,Mr.  PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, in many  parts of our country, there is a lot of  talk these days about industrial devel opment-about  the need  to  attract  new factories, new employers.  Recently,  the Trade Subcommittee  of the House Ways and Means Com mittee visited an industrial park that  would have made the heads of  job hungry Americans spin. It was clean,  bright, completely modem, well-land scaped,  and  occupied  by  literally  dozens of U.S. firms.  Unfortunately,  it was  in  Juarez,  Mexico, just across the border from El  Paso, TX. Hundreds of American com panies have set up factories Just across  the United States-Mexican border-at  the expense of American Jobs.  This is the topic of my most recent  weekly newspaper column. It follows:  (cid:1)VASHINGTONREPORT  <By Don J. Pease)  In northern Ohio,  there  is much  talk  these days about industrial development about the need to attract new factories, new  employers, to the area.  You should have seen the industrial park  I visited two weeks ago. Literally dozens of  U.S. firms have set up factories employing  thousands of workers.  The industrial park itself is attractive and  well-landscaped. The factory buildings are  uniformly new or nearly new.  Inside, 200, 400, 600 workers toll in each  factory. Each building  interior  is bright,  clean,  well-lit,  air  conditioned,  well equipped. A company cafeteria serves work ers meals at half the normal price. A compa ny infirmary is staffed by a nurse and vis ited regularly by a doctor.  The employes seem happy and content.  They are, according to their supervisors, ef ficient, productive, highly motivated work ers.  From the viewpoint of job-hungry north ern Ohioans, there is just one hitch in this  rosy picture. The industrial park is not in  the United States.  It's in Juarez, Mexico,  just across  border from El Paso, Texas.  The workers in those factories are Mexi cans.  They work for 68 cents an hour.  And they are drawing U.S. companies by  the hundreds to Mexico.  So far, over 650 American companies have  set up assembly operations in Juarez; No gales and other cities along the 1900-mlle  U.S.-Mexican border. General Motors, Gen eral Electric, RCA, Rockwell International,  Samsonite Corp., United Technologies Inc. the list goes on and on.  The managers of those U.S.-owned factories are clearly skittish about the 68-centsan-hour wages. They quickly make  points.  First,  the 68 cents  is  the hourly  rate.  Total employment cost  is about $1.40 per  hour when fringe benefits <mostly required  by the Mexican government> are factored  in.  the  April 24, 1985  Second, it is claimed, the assembly plants  in Mexico help to preserve jobs in the U.S.  that would otherwise be lost. Typically, the  Mexican ""maquila"" plants are strictly as sembly operations. All of the design and en gineering work is done at U.S. locations. All  of the parts to be assembled are made in the  U.S.  In fact, one incentive for the ""maqulla""  plants is that when the finished products  are returned to the U.S., the value of the  original U.S. parts and material is not sub ject to U.S. tariffs. U.S. duty is paid only on  the  ""value  added""  <i.e.,  labor  costs>  in  Mexico.  American firms claim they can't compete  with  Japanese, Korean,  Taiwanese  and  other competitors  if  they must pay high  American wages for hand assembly work.  The choice, they say, is this. Do you split  the work between a U.S. plant and a ""twin""  plant in Mexico, or do you lose the work al together?  There is evidence of truth to that conten tion. In Georgia and South Carolina, for ex ample, apparel manufacturers  find  it  in creasingly difficult to compete with import ed apparel from the Far East. By moving  their sewing operations  to Mexico,  these  companies preserve  jobs at home  in  the  design and cutting of fabrics. They also, in cidentally, continue to be in business as cus tomers of U.S. textile companies. Obviously,  apparel made in China uses textiles made in  China.  Still, it was wrenching for me to see all  those jobs in Mexico which used to be per formed in Ohio and elsewhere in the U.S.  If the choice of workers at an American  factory really is between no jobs at all and  sharing the jobs, the choice is clear if not  entirely pleasant.  But what of U.S. manufacturing  firms  which do not face foreign competition or  which are still competitive in the interna tional marketplace? They may not be forced  to move  their  assembly  operations  to  Mexico, but they can make higher profits if  they can cut their compensation costs  to  $1.40 per hour for hand assembly work. In  other words, if a company is making 9 per cent profit in the U.S., what is to prevent its  moving to Mexico and increasing its profit  to 10 percent? After all, the business of busi ness is to make a profit, and a good manager  is expected to maximize his or her compa ny's profit.  The Americans I  talked with in Juarez,  didn't have an answer  to  the question.  Frankly, I don't have an answer either. But  the question merits a  lot of  thought by  those of us who are trying desperately to  retain and foster economic health in areas  like northern Ohio.e  INTRODUCTION OF SPACE  WEAPONS TREATY RESOLUTION  HON.

583,857,7,Mr. ATKINS.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  week George P. ""Chubby"" Legrand,  Jr., the commissioner of Public Works  in Lowell, MA, is being honored by the  Lowell Lions Charities and the Retard ed Adults Rehabilitative Association  of Greater Lowell, Inc., as their ""Good  Guy of the Year.""  This is a man, Mr. Speaker, whom  we often talk about in Washington but  rarely see. A loving husband, a father  of four children, a grandfather of 11, a  veteran of World War II with the Sea Bees, he has  served  the people of  Lowell almost all of his adult life-for  the last 23 years as their commissioner  of public works. This job, which is so  demanding, has been performed with  skill and professionalism by Chubby.  What makes Chubby so remarkable,  Mr. Speaker, is that he is the embodi ment of sharing and caring. No  re quest is too small, no voice too weak,  no hour too late for Chubby to be re sponsive. But Mr. Speaker, we should  also know that no job was ever too big  for this man.  His shoulders are broad enough to  accept not only his family responsibil ities and his professional career, but  also to provide leadership in virtually  every major community organization.  Among the groups to which Chubby  belongs,  and  is  characteristically  active in, are the following: board of  directors of St. John's Men's Guild,  Lowell Boy's Club, Lowell Kiwanis  Club, Men of Merrimack, Veterans of  Foreign Wars, The American Legion,  58th SeaBee Association, Holy Name  Society, Merrimack Valley Catholic  Charities, American Red Cross, Na tional Audubon Society, the American  Forestry Association, Massachusetts  Highway Association, and the Ameri can Public Works Association.  His life is a reflection of his religious  faith and he has become a living ex ample of that faith for  those of us  who know him. Mr. Speaker, it is with  pride  that I  rise  today  to point  to  George P. ""Chubby"" Legrand, Jr., as a  man truly worthy of our attention in  the Congress today   ",1985
584,870,7,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I am  wearing one of the green buttons as  are many others in this room and it  does read, ""Thou shalt not steal.""  That admonition, you might remem ber, Mr. Speaker, is one of the Ten  Commandments, which most of us  were taught to obey from our earliest  years. We obeyed because it was the  will of God.  We now face a crisis in this House  because the majority is about to repeal  at least one of these Commandments,  the one on the button. That majority  has cleared the way for stealing the  congressional seat in the Eighth Con gressional District of Indiana.  As a freshman, I couldn't believe my  ears on the day that the task force was  appointed. One of the most temperate,  well-respected Members of this body,  the Honorable BILL FRENZEL, of Min nesota stated  that  the appointment  signaled that ""They are going to steal  the seat.""  It is now clear that he was right and  my  illusions  about  fair  play were  wrong.  Now that the theft is almost com plete, the majority has committed this  body to the new Commandment that  might makes right.  The  rest  of  us will  continue  to  adhere  to  the old Commandments.  Those still include God's prohibition  ""Thou shalt not steal.""  LET'S GUARD THE TREASURY  (Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1985
585,870,7,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  there is an awful lot .of stealing going  on from the Treasury and I think we  need to talk about that. If you look at  the morning paper, there is a moun tain of documents that have come out  about General Dynamics and many  other of our military contractors who  have really been out..and-out  looting  and raiding the taxpayers.  I think this is what we ought to act  on if we want to talk about stealing be cause this stealing is right out of the  taxpayers' pockets. If you noticed, in  the House hearings held yesterday the  auditors said they are having a terrible  time getting the Department of Jus tice to prosecute or to act on the cases  of fraud and waste they have.  It is  time  this body gets  serious  about real stealing, stealing of the tax payers' money. I also find in U.S. News  & World Report this week further evi dence of it, that the chairman of the  board of General Dynamics gave him self a 110 percent raise  last year.  I  want to assure you he was not at the  poverty  line  or  anywhere  near  it  before his raise.  The people making money out of the  defense bill are not the guys in uni form or not the people whose lives are  on the line, but the people who are  really making a monetary killing are  the defense contractors, and no one in  the administration is doing anything  about it. Let us get serious about the  business at hand and let us guard the  Treasury. Let us really go after steal ing.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY?  <Mr. HILLIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
586,870,7,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, what has  happened to the Democratic Party?  Why has  the party of Jefferson,  Jackson, Roosevelt, and Kennedy-the  party which has played such a signifi cant role in the evolution of American  liberty-become so morally bankrupt  as to deny Rick Mcintyre the seat to  which he was elected?  Why  has  the Democratic  Party  chosen to cut the thread of fair play  and political decency which forms the  very  fabric of  the democracy under  which we live?  Why have they chosen to use their  numbers in this body to impose their  will on a half million unrepresented  Hoosi~rs?  And why has the leadership chosen  to compromise  the working relation ship between the majority and minori ty parties in this House by making the  Eighth District of Indiana a test of po litical macho?  In the end, you may seat your candi date, Mr. Speaker, but you cannot vio late  both  principle  and  precedent  without a price.  There may be no antidote to counter  the poison which now stands as bar rier between Republicans and Demo crats and the work they need to ac complish in this Congress.  My last question, Mr. Speaker: Is all  this really worth it?  CENTRAL AMERICA: DOSE OF  REALITY-NO. 4  <Mr. GONZALEZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1985
587,870,7,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, the  Reagan administration decided in 1981  to provide covert aid  to stimulate a  guerrilla campaign against  the Gov ernment of Nicaragua. This decision  was communicated  in secret  to  the  House and Senate Intelligence Com mittees in December of that year. Nei ther committee thought that the idea  was particularly bright, but the Direc tor of the Central Intelligence Agency  assured one and all that this would be  a small, limited-purpose operation.  The Intelligence Committees did not  quite believe the assurances they were  given. Accordingly,  the  committees  agreed  to allow aid  to  the so-called  Contras, but explicitly limited the use  of the funds to interdict arms that the  administration  claimed were  being  shipped from Nicaragua to rebels in El  Salvador,  this  being  the  so-called  Boland amendment. The committees  also provided that none of the money  could be used for the purpose of over throwing the Government of Nicara gua. This proviso was secret, but Presi dent Reagan could have no doubt that  the Congress very much opposed the  idea of trying to carry out a guerrilla  campaign . against Nicaragua, for  the  same language was included in the De fense  appropriations  resolution  for  fiscal 1983-by a unanimous vote  in  the House.  Far from being a small, limited pur pose effort, by the time of that De cember open vote  in the House,  the  CIA had built up a 10,000-man Contra  army, based in Honduras. The Contras  never found any of the arms that they  were supposed to be stopping, and as  later events would prove,  the oper ation was hardly one of interdicting  arms. It was instead a campaign de signed  to overthrow  the Sandinista  government,  notwithstanding  what  the law said. A few months after the  adoption of the Boland amendment,  the Contras, using CIA support ves sels, advice, and materials, were laying  mines  in  the harbors of Nicaragua.  This was anything but an effort  to  interdict arms, and it was an operation  of far greater scope than Congress had  authorized. The blatant excesses and  outright stupidity of the Nicaraguan  operations  infuriated even  the most  hawkish of hawks, who found them selves embarrassed and undercut by  the violations of clear congressional  policy, and the outright violation of  the Boland amendment.  This is what the Boland amendment  provides, and the language is the same  in both the secret CIA authorization  of 1982 and the publicly adopted de fense title of the continuing resolution  adopted later that year:  ",1985
588,961,7,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Before respond ing, may I  inquire if this will delay  things? If the leader is ready to go for ward, I do not want to take the time.  ",1985
589,961,7,Mr. METZENBAUM., I said to him I  would give up the floor as soon as he  was ready.  ,1985
590,961,7,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," In view of the  fact  that we  have  a  necessarily  lengthy technical process in order to  get to the vote, as soon as he is ready  to do that, I would want to do that. In  the meantime, I welcome the chance  to chat further with the Senator from  Ohio.  First,  let me say that we need to  keep  in perspective how  those  loop holes got into the law. In general, each  of those so-called loopholes got into  the  law because  somebody  thought  there was a socially desirable purpose  to be served. Somebody thought that  what we need is more energy produc tion in this country; that it was unwise  for us to become excessively depend ent upon overseas sources of natural  gas and oil so we ought to have tax in centives in the law to take care of that  problem.  Somebody  else  said,  ""You  know,  really, our best energy  resource  is  solar energy, so wouldn't it be a great  idea if Congress passed a solar energy  tax credit?""  Somebody else came along and said,  ""You know,  the biggest problem we  have in this country is economic depri vation  in  the  inner cities. If people  just had jobs, a lot of these problems  would go  away. We cannot get  the  Federal Government to do the task of  providing  job opportunities;  the pri vate sector ought to do it. Let us give  them a tax incentive to create jobs.""  Then somebody said, maybe the Sen ator  from Colorado,  that we  really  ought to have more volunteers for the  Cancer Society and disaster work, so  we ought to give them an automobile  mileage allowance.  I am not avoiding the answer but I  am leading up to it.  Out of this process of truly well-in tentioned  amendments  to  the Tax  Code, each of which taken individually  is believed to have a socially beneficial  effect, we have created an enormously  complex and in my judgment inher ently unfair tax system. I say inher ently unfair because anything that is  as complicated as what we have now is  bound  to  be  unfair  because most  people cannot understand it and most  people are unable to take advantage of  all of its complex provisions.  The worst of it, let me say before I  get around to responding to the Sena tor's question,  is not only that it is  unjust in an economic sense, but that  it encourages the most talented people  in our country to spend a dispropor tionate amount of their time trying to  figure  out how  to  jockey  the  tax  system, rather than doing other more  socially beneficial kinds of work.  In  51-059 0-86-31 <Pt. 7)  other words, figuring out how to shel ter their income instead of making a  better mousetrap or building better  widgits.  That is where we are. We got here  over a  long period of time. I under stand the Senator's impatience of why  can we not fix this up.  We have made some progress. We  have closed some loopholes. We need  to do more.  I cannot share his feeling that, be cause we have not in a couple of years  corrected  the  inequities of  the Tax  Code that built up over 25 years, we  have failed. We are taking a step.  Very recently, about 3 or 4 weeks  ago, President Reagan, in one of his  Saturday radio broadcasts, said he in tended  to send up  legislation based  upon the so-called Treasury 1 proposal  to close loopholes. He did not endorse  Treasury l, which was the result of a  year-long study by Secretary Regan  and others. But he indicated the broad   parameters under which he wanted to  reform the Tax Code.  I  do  not  today  endorse without  seeing such a proposal. I do not know  if I am going to agree with everything  he is going to send up here in a few  days. But I do share the basic  idea  that we ought  to simplify  the Tax  Code, close the loopholes or at least a  lot of them, and after doing so, lower  the marginal tax rates, broader based  and lower rates.  I  think that is  the action we are  going to take. I believe at the right  time the vast majority of Senators will  want to support that.  That is not the task we have before  us today. The task we have before us  today is to adopt a budget resolution  which will bring these deficits under  control.  I see that the majority leader is now  on his feet and, I believe, prepared to  proceed with that task.  ",1985

592,961,7,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President, I  wish to insert at this point in the CoNGRESSIONAL RECORD more complete in formation about  total  taxes paid by  American corporations. It was report ed in the Senate today, and in nation wide  television  last night that large  U .. S. corporations are not paying Fed eral income taxes. Specific companies  were named.  Mr. President, my staff has called  each of the 13 companies that have  been named, asking  them for  their  total  taxes paid,  including Federal,  State, and local income taxes, Social  Security  taxes, unemployment  com pensation  taxes,  Superfund-toxic  waste clean-up-taxes, windfall profits  taxes, foreign income taxes, property  taxes, production taxes, excise taxes,  workers'  compensation  and  other  taxes. The  information furnished  to  me is completely at variance with the  impression being created. That is, that  large firms with huge profits pay no  tax.  Mr. President, it was asserted that a  number of companies, among  them  Texaco,  Inc. ""had a  free  ride  from  their Government for the last 3 years  who have not paid a penny in taxes.""  But according to Texaco, this is not  the case. Let me quote from a Texaco  press release:  TExAco CHALLENGES FACTUAL ACCURACY OF  TAX STUDY BY PARTISAN RESEARCH GROUP  WHITE PLAINS, NY, April 15.-The allegations contained in the partisan-funded Citi zens for Tax Justice Study that Texaco Inc.  paid no Federal income tax during the years  1981-83 are grossly inaccurate, Texaco said  today.  Texaco paid Federal income taxes in each  of the yea.rS 1981-83 aggregation over $120  million. These payments were in addition to  the $2.3 billion of Federal windfall profits  tax the company incurred in those years.  The Federal windfall tax is directly deducti ble in computing Federal income tax so the  Federal income tax payments would have  been significantly higher were it not for the  billions of windfall tax incurred by Texaco.  In addition, Texaco had major capital in vestment  expenditures  during  1981-83.  Under the Federal program to encourage in vestment, these expenditures generated tax  credits which also reduced the amount of  Federal tax in both the current year and  prior years.  Investment  tax credits have  been a major contributor to the Nation's  economic growth and Job creation.  Texaco also paid $1.9 billion in other U.S.  direct  taxes  during  the  1981-83  period.  These taxes on its operations also are de ductible  for Federal  income  tax calcula tions.  Overall,  the company's worldwide direct  taxes for the 3-year period totaled $15.1 bil lion, compared with its reported net profits  of $4.9 billion.  Xerox, Inc. was also said not to have  paid any income taxes and in fact, was  said to have received a large Federal  tax refund between 1981and1983. Ac cording to Xerox on information that  was available for 1983, it is true they  paid no Federal  income  tax and re ceived a $4 million refund. It is also  true, however, that the company paid:  ",1985
593,1000,7,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, if the  administration has its way, the United  States will  be  the  only  developed  nation in the world without a national  passenger rail service. Despite increas ing ridership and decreasing reliance  on Federal subsidies, Amtrak is slated  for  extinction  under  the  proposed  budget for fiscal year 1986.  A review of Amtrak's recent record  and the effect of its elimination reveal  the administration's plan to be penny wise and pound-foolish. Over the last  14 years, the Federal Government has  spent $5.2 billion in upgrading the sys tem's  infrastructure  and  improving  the service in the Northeast corridor  between Boston and Washington. This  investment  is now beginning  to pay  off, with Amtrak transporting over 20  million passengers in 1984, an 18-per cent increase over 1983 ridership, with  its  best  ever  on-time  performance.  This has come while the Federal Gov ernment's share of operating expenses  has decreased, dropping from $896 mil lion in fiscal year 1981 to $684 million  in fiscal year 1985.  And what will it cost to dismantle  the  system? As  the Boston Globe  points out in the following editorial,  25,000 Amtrak  employees,  including  over 700  in Massachusetts, would be  laid off, costing the Federal Govern ment an estimated $2.1 billion in labor  protection benefits.  SAVING AMTRAK  The Amtrak rail passenger system was one  of the achievements of the Nixon Adminis tration. Under  the  leadership of  former  Massachusetts. Gov. John Volpe, who was  then Secretary of Transportation, the feder al government took over passenger service  from the railroads, which had found it a  money loser.  The arrangement has worked well. After a  difficult transition. Amtrak's employees and  managers  have  cooperated  admirably  to  hold down costs and improve service. Last  year the system carried 20 million passen gers.  The Reagan Administration proposes  to  shut down Amtrak to ""save"" $684 million in  annual subsidies. There would be no savings  for some years, since the government would  have to pay more than $2 billion in sever ance  to  the 25,000 employees who would  lose their Jobs, and it would have to write  off more than $3 billion in equipment and  other assets.  It is misleading for the Administration to  assert that Amtrak competes unfairly with  unsubsidized rival forms of transportation.  All modes of transportation are subsidized,  directly or indirectly. Buses do not pay for  the full cost of the highways and streets  that they travel. The government subsidizes  airlines by providing air traffic control.  Because air service is so much faster than  rail service, Amtrak does not compete with  the airlines for business passengers except  April 25, 1985  on very short trips. The much higher price  of air travel shows that business travelers  would rather save time than money. The or dinary weekday fare between Boston and  New York  is $25  for a  five-hour  trip on  Amtrak compared  to $65  for a 30-minute  flight on the Eastern shuttle.  Amtrak, however, does compete with air lines for the business of low-income travel ers of families with small children. It also  competes with bus companies, which charge  slightly less for a slightly faster trip. If it  were to be put out of business, the bus lines  would be free to raise their fares substan tially, and low-income travelers would have  no choice.  W. Graham Claytor Jr., the chairman of  Amtrak, points out that it is the only form  of  transportation  that could move  large  numbers of people in a national emergency,  and that in many small communities, it is  the only  transportation.  If  it were abol ished, the United States would be the only  industrial nation without a  rail passenger  system. Claytor has promised  to wage a  battle to save Amtrak. He deserves public  and congressional support.e  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  THE  STROM  THURMOND  HIGH  SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL TEAM  HON.

Such  emphasis  on  oratorical  skills accounts for Edgefield County  having produced 10 governors, 5 lieu tenant  governors  and many  other  statesmen.

595,1013,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  and my distinguished colleagues, I am  introducing a bill today that will pro tect, preserve and enhance the health  care delivery system in rural America.  The National Health Service Corps  Reauthorization bill will provide key  medical personnel to our citizens living  in  medically  underserved  areas  throughout this great Nation.  The National Health Service Corps  serves over 2 million Americans. In my  Third Congressional District of New  Mexico  alone-over  100,000  people  who  live  in rural and remote areas  have come to depend on the National  Health Service Corps staffed clinics  for  their principal sources of health  care.  The National Health Service Corps  reauthorization bill that I am intro ducing today addresses many of the  concerns expressed in the President's  veto message last year and includes all  provisions agreed upon in last year's  House/Senate conference report. The  bill will authorize the National Health  Service Corps Program for an addi tional 3 years. It will authorize  the  Health Service Corps Scholarship Pro gram for the same period of time and  provide funding for 1,175 new scholar ships to train and educate medical per sonnel in addition to continuing cur rent scholarships.  The National Health Service Corps  provides medical personnel to medical ly underserved areas throughout the  country. It is not a government give away program. These medical person nel in return for Government scholar ship aid, make a commitment to serve  in a health service corps clinic for a  limited period of  time. The clinics  then pay back the Government for its  9551  cost in educating the individual-in ad dition to a salary.  Mr. Speaker,  the National Health  Service Corps is vital national program  that makes a major difference in the  lives of  rural Americans who have  come to depend on the services provid ed.  Since President Reagan took office  there have been virtually no n.ew Na tional Health Service Corps scholar ships. Without new doctors  in  the  pipeline the program will die.  A high percentage of the patients  who use Health Service Corps staffed  clinics  throughout  the country are  older Americans living on small fixed  incomes who  have  chronic  health  problems.  This bill benefits the Nation as a  whole.  It  is  a  creative,  low  cost,  common sense approach to successful ly deliver quality health care to those  in need. I hope that my colleagues will  join with me in supporting the reau thorization of  the National Health  Service Corps Program and not allow  this administration  to roll back  the  clock  to  a  time when many  rural  Americans had no access  to health  care. I hope the President will develop  some compassion and see the wisdom  in continuing a health care program  which  is so critical  to  the needs of  rural Americans.e  NEVADA'S VOICE FOR  DEMOCRACY  HON.

597,1026,7,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, the San  Mateo County Historical Association is  celebrating its 50th year as the institu tional memory and preserver of the  heritage of San Mateo County, CA.  Members of the association will gather  with community leaders in early May  at various events to commemorate this  occasion, beginning with an anniversa ry dinner.  I am honored and delighted to have  the association and  its members as  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  may constituents. The association can  boast significant accomplishments  in  preserving  important  buildings  and  furnishings and  in maintaining and  preserving records and memorabilia in  an excellent museum on the campus of  the College of San Mateo overlooking  San Francisco Bay.  The historical association brings to gether more  than 1,400  individuals  and organizations in one of the largest  and most effective nonprofit historical  programs in the bay area. With a mini mal membership fee, it attracts devot ed docents who extend the resources  and the information to thousands of  school children, adults, and visitors.  The association has sponsored some of  the most creative fundraising events from sales of rare and old books to an  annual Victorian Days Fair in a local  park with  ethnic  foods,  costumes,  music, and visible history combined in  a joyful weekend for the community.  The devoted members of the 'associa tion are undertaking the development  of  an  oral  history  of San Mateo  County and its residents, as well as  continually  improving and enlarging  the museum. The association museum  is 1 of only 600 accredited museums  throughout the entire United States.  This fine  institution has seen more  than 1 million visitors  through  the  years. Its research library is used by  students and local history buffs.  I am proud and delighted to report  to the Members of the Congress that  the San Mateo County Historical As sociation at age 50 is healthy and look ing forward to completing a full centu ry of service to the peninsula.e  THE TURKISH BRIGADE AND  HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 192  HON. JOSEPH J. DioGUARDI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1985  e Mr. DioGUARDI. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to accomplish  two  tasks,  recognition of  the bravery of  those  Turkish soldiers who fought with and  saved the lives of many Americans, by  introducing a joint resolution to estab lish January 25, 1986, as Turkish Bri gade Day,  and  to cosponsor House  Joint  Resolution  192,  establishing  April 24 as Man's Inhumanity to Man  Day.  January 1986 will mark the 35th an niversary of the actions of the Turkish  Brigade which saved the lives of many  Americans. During the Korean War,  the valor of the Turkish troops who  fought alongside our troops was direct ly responsible for saving the lives of  thousands of American troops. In fact,  units of the Turkish Army fighting in  Korea were twice cited for their brav ery and heroism in the defense of free dom, receiving Distinguished Unit CiApril ~5, 1985  tations for actions taken on January  25-27, 1951, and on May 28-29, 1953.  I believe that it is only appropriate  that we,  in Congress, establish  this  day in memory of the actions of the  soldiers who gave their lives in defense  of  those of Americans. Turkey  is a  valued ally whose progress in personal  and economic freedom makes it espe cially appropriate that Congress take  the time to make this expression of  gratitude. The hand-to-hand combat  that the Turks engaged in is perhaps  the most difficult and demanding form  of war. They excelled at it.  In addition  to my  introduction of  legislation commending the actions of  a valued ally, I am rising to cosponsor  a  resolution which will off end  that  same ally. I was originally reluctant to  take this action, but after investigat ing the situation, came to the conclu sion that to fail to do so would be an  abdication of my responsibility as a  Congressman  to make  the  tough  choices I was elected to make. The loss  of millions of Armenian lives during  the First World War at the hands of  the Turkish Army cries out for recog nition. Therefore, I have taken these  actions simultaneously.  I believe that we can never forget  history, but I believe  that we must  learn from  it. Armenians and Turks  are intertwined by geography and, in  many instances, by similar heritages  because of the proximity of the two  groups in the Middle East. It is my  hope that they can learn to live  to gether and work for the common good  of their peoples. I deplore the current  terrorist activities of militant and ex tremist groups in Turkey which do not  represent the views of the Armenian  people.e  NATIONAL COIN WEEK 1985  HON. FRANK ANNUNZIO  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1985  e ",1985
598,1026,7,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, this  week, April 21 through April 27, is Na tional Coin Week. This distinctive and  unique week serves to recognize the  historical,  cultural,  and  educational  significance  of numismatics  in  the  United States.  The theme is of this year's National  Coin Week is ""Numismatics: Open the  Door with Books."" The  theme  is a  timely one. Coins can be a wonderful  teaching aid, and an interest in foreign  coins can stimulate not only an inter est in history and geography but of  foreign languages and customs as well.  To many of us,  coins are merely  pieces of money to be used to buy a  newspaper or a soda, to pay for a ride  on public transit or to be left as a tip.  When we take a moment, however, we  will see that our coins bear the like",1985
599,1039,7,Mr.  KENNEDY.,"  Mr.  President,  today, April 26, 1985, marks the 37th  anniversary of the birth of the State  of Israel. Throughout these 37 years,  Israel has proven itself to be, in the  words  of  President  Kennedy,  ""a  symbol to all of the invincibility of the  human spirit."" I ask that, on this spe cial day, we pause and consider all  that Israel represents  to the United  States.  During the last four decades, Israel  has remained a bastion of liberty in  the Middle East and a source of hope  for millions of Jews  throughout the  world. She is our closest friend,  the  only real democracy, and our strongest  ally in the Middle East. I am proud to  have  been part of  the  continuing  effort in the Senate to ensure the free dom and security of Israel.  I am equally proud  to have been  part of the successful effort last fall to  establish a ""free trade area"" between  Israel and the United States. The re duction of tariffs that interfere with  trade will benefit our economy as well  as theirs. It will give Israel the oppor tunity for maximum economic devel opment at minimum cost. Most of all,  a free trade area reaffirms the special  relationship between our  two coun tries and the pledge we have made as  Americans never to break faith with  the people of Israel.  I believe  the United States has a  duty to help Israel-a duty that in cludes ensuring that Israel will one  day be free from all threats of aggres sion. A strong Israel is essential for a  lasting peace in the Middle East. I vig orously oppose any new arms sales to  any country that is pledged to destroy  Israel. What the Middle East needs is  not more sophisticated arms for Arab  States but more sophisticated diplo macy to bring the parties to the con ference table and into the Camp David  process.  We must strive to keep the doors of  Israel open as a place of refuge to all  Jews. Sadly, the plight of Soviet Jews  remains high in our concern. Emigra tion last year was at its lowest level in  20 years-Just 896 Jews were permitted  to  leave  the Soviet Union in 1984from a peak of 51,000 in 1979. Togeth er we must continue the work of re uniting families and freeing prisoners  of conscience and stand beside these  courageous people-Ida Nudel, Anato ly Shcharansky, Andrei Sakharov, and  Elena Bonner-not only for their sake,  but also  for  the  sake of countless  others whose names we do not know.  In the great cause of human rights, we  must never give up or give in.  As President Kennedy said in 1956  before 50,000 people in New York City,  on the anniversary of Israel's birth,  ""Today we celebrate the eighth birth day of Israel-but I say without hesitation that she will live to see an 80th  birthday-and an 800th.  Mr. President, on this occasion, we  in the Senate pause to remember the  courage and the vision of the founders  of Israel, and we commend the genera tions that have followed them in the  struggle to build a homeland of free dom and democracy.  YOUTH SUICIDE  ",1985
600,1039,7,Mr. DENTON.," Mr. President, on  February 20, 1985, I introduced Senate  Joint Resolution 53, a joint resolution  to designate the month of June 1985  as ""Youth Suicide Prevention Month.""  I am pleased that on March 28,  the  resolution was passed by the Senate  by voice  vote. The  resolution now  awaits consideration by the House of  Representatives.  I am equally pleased that the Gover nor of the great State of Alabama has  seen  fit  to proclaim June 1985  as  ""Youth Suicide Prevention Month."" I  would ask unanimous consent that a  copy of the proclamation signed by  Governor Wallace on March 28, 1985,  be placed in the RECORD at the conclu sion of my statement.  Mr. President, I commend Governor  Wallace and my colleagues  in both  Houses of Congress for assisting me in  calling  attenton  to  the nationwide  tragedy of youth suicide.  There being no objection, the procla mation was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  PROCLAJIATION  Whereas, the youth of society represent  the hope for the future; and  Whereas, the rate of youth suicide has in creased more than threefold in the last two  decades; and  Whereas, over five thousand young Ameri cans took their lives last year, many more  attempted suicide, and countless  families  were affected; and  Whereas, youth suicide is a phenomenon  which must be addressed by a concerned so ciety; and  Whereas, youth suicide is a national prob lem which can only be solved through the  combined efforts of  individuals,  families,  communities,  organizations,  and  govern ment to educate society:  Now,  therefore,  I, George C. Wallace,  Governor of  the State of Alabama,  do  hereby proclaim June, 1985, as ""Youth Sui cide Prevention Month.""  JAKE GARN, SPACE EXPLORER  ",1985
601,1039,7,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. President, I  rise to welcome the return to this body  of a down-to-Earth colleague who nev ertheless has ventured out of  this  world:  the senior Senator from  the  State of Utah, JAKE GARN.  While the eyes and ears of the world  were focused on our last shuttle be cause of our space Senator, Hawaii's  people were  concerned with  great  pride  about  the  exploits  and  safe  return of the Aloha State's first space",1985
602,1052,7,Mr. DOLE.," I do not quarrel. the dis tinguished  ranking member of  the  Budget Committee. the Senator from  Florida. It is not our purpose to shut  anyone out. It would seem to me that  this orderly process may be necessary  for a time since we have the responsi bility of getting a package up here by  following that process.  I also want to indicate that the mi nority leader did indicate that we had  a window where we could have voted.  But I  learned then that the distin guished Se µator  from North Carolina,  Senator HELMS, was already in North  Carolina preparing to attend the serv ices of the late Senator Ervin and we  were not able to proceed on that basis.  I just hope that we can resolve any  differences without any serious prob lem.  I understand  that we do have  problems. We have not got a  long  margin on  this side.  and absentees  make a difference.  There is no objection that we will  meet at noon on Monday, no objection  to the special orders. or that we have  routine morning business until  the  hour of 1 p.m.  It would be my hope that perhaps  today we can run the clock on the  pending amendment. which is amend ment No.  3,  and perhaps start  the  clock running on. amendment No. 4. I  believe there are 2 hours on amend ment No. 4. Then we would go out  until Monday.  ",1985
603,1052,7,Mr. BYRD., Is the distinguished ma jority leader addressing me?  ,1985
604,1052,7,Mr. DOLE.,  I was  reciting what I  thought we might do the remainder of  the day.  ,1985
605,1052,7,Mr. BYRD.," Of course, the majority  leader will propose  the program  in  that regard and I will certainly respect  his wishes. If he wants to stay and  have time run on the amendments he  has identified, that is all right with us.  If I may. I would like to add one fur ther thing.  I know that the distinguished major ity  leader has  the  responsibility  to  lead the Senate, and to set the sched ule and so on. But we on our side also  have a responsibility. We do not want  to delay or obstruct or anything of  that nature just for the sake of doing  so without cause. But we. too. have re sponsibilities to help mold this final  product that passes the Senate. We all  have constituencies who expect us to  do everything we can to protect the  future investments in America by way  of education of the young, for exam ple; to insist on equal. fair, and equita ble treatment of the elderly; and to  consider the fact that when our people  get  old,  health  problems  increase  which cause medical services to keep  going up, up, and up. We have a re sponsibility to protect these people by  holding Medicare premiums to a rea sonable level.  How can we do  these things if we  cannot get recognized on this floor to  call up amendments? How do we off er  amendments  to  this measure  if we  cannot get recognized?  The distinguished majority  leader  has indicated. and rightly so. that at  some point we are going to have our  chances. but we can not willingly con sent-we might have it forced on us to allowing the majority leader to con tinue to call up amendments and shut  us Democrats out. I do not know what  assurances the distinguished majority  leader may have had to give to any op posing Members on his side in return  for  their votes  on  the  leadership White House budget package. Maybe  he has not had  to off er them any thing. But maybe he has.  If so. that does not mean that we on  this side of the aisle have to help him  make good on such commitments. We  do not have any responsibility on our  side to help the distinguished majority  leader carry out any promises he may  have made in order to pick up votes  for his package.  I  like  and  respect  the majority  leader. and have a tremendously high  regard for him.  As majority leader he is in a tough  position if he has had to make certain  assurances on his side, ""We will see  that you off er the next amendment,  that you get the next amendment. and  then we will give  the Democrats a  shot.""  We think there is an element of fair ness here that we Democrats have a  right to insist on, that we begin having  an equal share. a fair shake. on off er ing our amendments-one on this side,  one on the other side, one on this side,  and so forth.  That is not an unreasonable request.  I can understand the distinguished  majority  leader's problem.  I  sympa thize with him. But with all due re spect. and with all of my affection for  him. I have to say that we on this side  are under no obligation to help him  make good on any promises that he  may have made to others on his side.  We cannot willingly agree. and we will  not agree. once having adopted or dis posed of the leadership-White House  budget package, amendment F.  that  we will continue without objection and  without efforts being made on our own  behalf.  The distinguished majority  leader  might be able to roll over us; but we  want  to  insist and will continue  to  insist that we have our shot at amend ing this resolution following the dispo sition of the leadership-White House  budget package, and that we have an  alternate working order beyond that.  Hopefully, we can work out some thing that will allow us to operate in  that fashion. It is  in the interest of  fairness that I ask this. I think it is a  reasonable request. and I beg the dis tinguished majority  leader's  indul gence for my having taken so much  time.  ",1985
606,1052,7,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President. still on  the resolution. we shall see what we  might be able to work out. I just went  back and checked the 1981 Reconcilia tion Act and  there were 28 amend ments. Twenty-two of them were of fered by Democrats. Eighteen in a row  were offered by Democrats. Eighteen  straight amendments came from the  Democratic side.  I must say when I am building this  little tree, I am having to go through  this rather tortuous process to vote on  one amendment. It is not as if I were  voting on seven amendments. But I do  understand if there is some way to ac commodate all concerns-and I must  say we are just as concerned on this  side. or more so, about the elderly. the  students, the farmers, the workers and  any other group I may have left out.  We are concerned about the economy.  too.  The distinguished minority leader is  exactly correct that if. in fact, we have  this process. it is not incumbent upon  him  to  furnish  any  assistance.  makes it much easier, but certainly, I  have no quarrel with that and we shall  just proceed  for a while  this after noon.  May I ask the minority leader one  additional question? It is my under standing that there might still be a  possibility of considering one nomina tion yet this afternoon, is that correct?

607,1078,7,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to  introduce by request this  legislation to authorize the transfer of  Washington National and Washington  Dulles Airports from the Federal Gov ernment to a local operating author ity.  This bill, which was drafted by the  Department of Transportation, is not  perfect. However,  it is a step in the  right direction, and Secretary Eliza beth Dole and former Gov. Linwood  Holton are to be commended for their  vision and perseverance in crafting a  legislative plan to transfer the airports  to local control.  I have questions about a number of  elements in this legislation. The Com merce committee and the full Senate  must carefully examine each element  of this bill, and pay particular atten tion to the potential elimination of the  passenger cap and the continuing ap plicability of the current time slot lim itations and night-time noise  rules.  The application of the-National Envi ronmental Policy Act CNEPAl  to air port activities and the jurisdiction of  the National Capital Planning Com mission CNCPCl must also be  fully  considered.  If we fail to succeed in enacting this  legislation during  this Congress, we  face the prospect of these airports re maining under Federal control in per petuity. This  is  an  outcome  that  nobody would prefer-local residents,  the Department  of Transportation,  and the commercial airlines all recog nize the benefits which will come from  local management.  As a member of the Commerce Com mittee, I look forward to the hearings  on this bill and to working with my  colleagues to ensure that this bill is ac ceptable and fair to all who are affect ed by these airports.

610,1078,7,Mr. MATHIAS.," I feel it more appro priate that the bill be ref erred to the  Senate Governmental Affairs Commit tee and its Subcommittee on the Dis trict of Columbia and Government Ef ficiency, which has responsibility for  overseeing matters involving the Dis trict of Columbia. Since the transfer  proposal has a significant impact on  the Washington metropolitan area, I  believe it is critical that the subcom mittee have the opportunity to review  the ramifications of the bill.  If the  Commerce Committee  ls given  juris diction over the bill, I am interested in  joint or sequential referral to give us  sufficient time to assess the impact of  the bill on the Washington metropoli tan area, its residents, and the airports  serving  it-Washington  National,  Washington Dulles International, and  Baltimore-Washington International.  ",1985
611,1078,7,Mr. DANFORTH.," I, of course, want  to accommodate your committee  in  every way. I do believe, however, that  the Senate Commerce Committee  is  the appropriate committee to have ju risdiction over the bill. Nevertheless, I  believe you have  raised  some valid  issues and I will make every effort to  meet your concerns. Therefore, I will  make sure the committee closely scru tinizes the impact on the District of  Columbia,  its residents, and the air ports that serve it. Toward that end,  we would like to invite you to partici pate fully with the Senate Commerce  Committee during its hearings on the  airports bill and we will also invite key  officials who represent the Washing ton metropolitan area  to  testify at  that time. Additionally, I am prepared  to commit myself to hold off any final  action  in  the Commerce Committee  until at  least June 30  to give  the  Senate Governmental Affairs Commit tee an opportunity to hold hearings on  the proposal.

614,1091,7,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, last  year Senator CoHEN and I joined with  many  of our Senate  colleagues  in  sponsoring Senate  Joint Resolution  206, designating the first Sunday of  August-the 40th anniversary of Hiro shima-as a ""National Day of Peace,""  and requesting the President to issue a  proclamation calling upon the people  of the United States to observe this  day with appropriate celebrations and  activities  to  enhance  the  cause  of  peace in the nuclear age. At this time,  we are reintroducing this joint resolu tion in the Senate, together with Sen ators ANDREWS,  BURDICK,  COCHRAN,  CRANSTON,  DANFORTH,  DECONCINI,  DIXON,  DODD,  DURENBERGER,  EVANS,  EXON,  HATFIELD,  HOLLINGS,  INOUYE,  LAUTENBERG,  LEvIN, MATSU NAGA,  PELL,  PROXMIRE, RIEGLE,  SAR BANES, STAFFORD, STENNIS, and WILSON.  An identical resolution has been intro duced in the House by Representative  ATKINS as House Joint Resolution 90.  For all of us, August 6, 1945, the day  of the bombing of Hiroshima, marked  the dawn of the nuclear age-and the  onset of the greatest danger to hu manity in the history of the Earth,  the spectre of nuclear war. It is par ticularly appropriate for the Congress  to provide national recognition for a  ""Day of Peace"" this year, on the 40th  anniversary of Hiroshima. Such a day  was originally conceived and celebrat ed in 1980, in Concord, MA. From its  beginning in the town famous  Americans as  the site of  the ""shot  heard  round  the world,""  the Peace  Day celebration had grown by 1984 to  include officially observed  statewide  ""Days of Peace"" in Arkansas, Florida,  Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylva nia, Rhode  Island, Nebraska, New  York, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  I have stood at ground zero; I have  walked  the  streets  of Hiroshima,  streets that lead to a bridge forever  imprinted with the shadows of that  day-literally branded in the concrete  by  the heat of  that  fateful blast.  There  is a museum  there  today, a  museum which must horrify all of us  lucky enough to have not been in Hir oshima on the morning of August 6,  1945. The most powerful memorial of  that day for every American, however,  is the dwindling number of survivors  who live in our midst. Their very lives  are silent testimony every day that nu clear war  is  a  reality-and nuclear  peace a necessity.  We all await with hope the outcome  of the United States-Soviet arms con trol negotiations. We can make that  hope more substantial for every Amer ican by providing a day when people  to all  across the country can come together  to consider the possibilities for a world  at peace  and  reduced  international  tensions-for now, and for the future.  This hope  is neither ideological nor  partisan. We may perceive different  paths, but we share the same goal that our children, and our children's  children, will never wake to see the  terrible light of Hiroshima.  I hope that all of our colleagues will  join us in supporting this joint resolu tion and ensuring its passage. I ask  unanimous consent that the full text  of  the  ""Peace Day Resolution"" be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the joint  resolution was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.J. Ra. 124  Whereas all Americans need to reflect on  the prospect of peace among the peoples of  the world; and  Whereas a time should be set aside when  people of all shades of opinion can come to gether in unity to consider the possibilities  for peaceful coexistence: Now, therefore, be  it  Resolved, by the Senate and the House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That the  first Sunday of August is designated as ""Na tional Day of Peace"" and the President is  requested  to  issue a proclamation calling  upon the people of the United States to ob serve such a day with appropriate celebra tions and activities.e  NATIONAL DAY 01' PEACE  e ",1985
615,1091,7,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be introducing today, along  with Senator KENNEDY, a joint resolu tion which would designate the first  Sunday of August as a ""National Day  of Peace.""  The purpose of this Joint resolution  is as simple as it is uncontroversial. It  is meant to provide a focus for people  from all walks of life and all political  persuasions  to come  together to ex plore and celebrate the boundless pos sibilities of a peaceful world.  The reality of  the modern age  is  that of one suffused by conflict and  confrontation, of concerns over  the  nuclear balance of terror and analyses  of mutual force structure. Establish ment of a ""National Day of Peace""  would provide a welcome counterpoint  and opportunity for all Americans to  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  peace and rejection of war as a means  for resolving differences between na tions.  Mr. President, eight States of the  Union have  already designated  the  first Sunday in August as a ""National  Day of Peace.""

616,1156,7,Mr.  BUMPERS.," Mr.  President,  today,  I wish  to  join with Senator  PRYOR in paying tribute to Mr. Ikey L.  Baldwin who will  soon be  retiring  after 35 years of service to the people  of Arkansas through his work with the  Farmers Home Administration. Arkan sas, and especially Arkansas farmers,  have benefited greatly from his dedi cated years of service, and although  we are saddened by his retirement, we  are honored to have this opportunity  to recognize Ikey for his work.  Ikey is a decorated Army veteran of  World War II. He enlisted 1 month  after the attack on Pearl Harbor and  was discharged 5 years later as a first  lieutenant,  after  having  served  at  Dutch Harbor, AK, and at Honolulu,  Saipan, and Iwo Jima. Ikey continued  to serve his country in the Officers'  Reserve until December 1958.  Before  the war,  Ikey completed 2  years in general agriculture at what is  now Arkansas Tech University and he  completed his studies after the war at  Mississippi State University, receiving  a degree in agriculture in August 1947.  Over the years Ikey has pursued grad uate studies  in several disciplines at  Mississippi State, the University of Ar kansas, and at Henderson State Uni versity.  After a 2-year stint as superintend ent of the Jessieville, AR, High School  and another 2 years as an agriculture  instructor for World War II veterans  at Fountain Lake, AR, High School,  Ikey began his long service with the  FmHA in 1951 as an assistant county  supervisor. From  1951  to  1954  he  worked  in  this capacity  in Howard,  Hempstead  and Yell Counties,  and  from 1955 to 1961 he served as county  supervisor  in Lafayette County. He  was promoted to the State office in  1962. In addition to his regular duties  as a  farmer program specialist, Ikey  has served as the State appraisal train er  since  1969,  a  position  that has  gained him widespread recognition as  an expert in farm tract appraisal tech niques.

Add to this the countless numbers of  FmHA employees whom he has  tu tored over the years, from State direc tors to county office assistants, and we  can  understand  the  tremendous  impact he has had on our State. And,  of course, you can also add the forth right asslstance he has rendered  to  Senator PRYOR and myself, and others  in the congressional delegation, as ex amples of his value to the farmers of  Arkansas.

As a  tribute  to his spirit,  Ikey has generated the rumor that he  is leaving the FmHA to begin a cypress  tree farm in the hill section of Gar land County, AR, and that we are all  invited to the first harvest 1 million or  so years from now. Seriously, we will  all miss Ikey, and we wish him the  best.e  ORDER OF BUSINESS  ",1985

Her  tireless  campaigning  for  women's suffrage serves as a strong  example  for women concerned with  justice. Women's suffrage was an im portant part of  the platform  that  brought her to Congress in 1917. She  crossed the entire country convincing  Americans  that women deserved  the  right  to vote alongside of men. On  January 10, 1918, Jeannette Rankin  introduced  the suffrage amendment,  the year in which it finally passed the  House.  She continually championed m .. pop ular causes. She supported children's  protective legislation at a  time when  children were considered a viable and  exploitable  labor  source.  Jeannette  Rankin was the only Member of Con gress who  voted  against America's  entry  into both World Wars. Even  though both these votes probably led  to her def eat  in running for office  again, she stood by her principles. She  had the personal satisfaction of know ing she had remained true to herself.  Her persistence and her dauntless  spirit serve as a strong example for all  who believe in civil rights for all Amer icans.e  ",1985

638,1195,7,Mr. GARCIA.," Madam Speaker, the  President's scheduled trip to the Bit burg Cemetery has caused a great deal  of furor both among his supporters  and those who do not always agree  with him.  Why is  there so much controversy  over this visit? Why is a symbolic trip  to a cemetery so important? Because  symbolism  is all  the victims of  the  Holocaust have  left.  It  is  the only  solace they can find from the horror  they  experienced. We  cannot  ade quately imagine that horror; we can  only pay respect through our remem brance.  The words ""never again"" ring loudly  from the survivors and the families of  the survivors of the Holocaust. But to  make certain that those words have  meaning, it is up to us to join with  them  in  their efforts  to keep  the  memory of this tragedy alive.  I think it is important that when we  ask the President not to go to Bitburg  we do so not as Democrats and Repub licans, but as Americans who do not  want our Nation to be in any way con nected with the evil of the SS. The  memory of the excesses of that evil  must be preserved so that we can for ever guard against this dark side of  humanity. The President must not go  to Bitburg and betray the vigilance of  this memory.e  e Mr. McGRATH. Madam Speaker,  the message  is clear. The American  people are distraught over the memo ries that the President's proposed trip  reawakens. Pleas have come from all  segments of our society imploring the  President not to visit Bitburg's mili tary cemetery.  I have never received such  impas sioned mail as that which this contro versy has evoked. This outpouring re affirms my belief that the President  must find another way to signal our  sincere reconciliation toward the dem ocratic government that rose from the  ashes of Nazi Germany 40 years ago.  I have heard from veterans, Holo caust survivors, and many people who  do not  fall  into either category.  I  would like to share with you the sentiments  they  have  expressed which  highlight  the height of  the despair  and confusion they feel.  I'm a veteran of World War II who lost  many dear friends fighting for our country      In decorating and honoring the graves  of ex-Nazis we are doing a disservice to the  cherished memories and the ideals of our  American war dead.-Mr. Benjamin Feld man, 5th District, New York.  As a refugee from Nazi Germany who lost  his parents and innumerable dear ones in  the Holocaust, as a volunteer for the draft  for the U.S. Army who entered service prior  to Pearl Harbor, as a participant of D-Day  invasions of both North Africa and Sicily,  having been wounded in action in Norman dy, as a recipient of the purple heart, the  bronze  star,  and  the Belgian Croix de  Guerre Avec Palme, but above all as an  American, I am sickened and offended by  the  insensitivity  displayed  toward  the  memory of the thousands of American serv icemen killed by  those whose graves you  intend  to visit on your upcoming  trip  to  Germany.-Siegmund Spiegel, 5th District,  New York.  One doesn't have to be a World War II  veteran or Jewish to resent the idea of the  President of  the United States honoring  Nazi war dead     Millions of mature 60  plus and elderly 70 plus Americans, like us  remember vividly Allied sacrifices in World  War  II-including American prisoners of  War butchered by Nazi  troops near that  cemetery    . Many living Germans were  part of Hitler's efforts to build a Reich that  would rule the world     .Honoring all war  dead is a meaningless blurring of the fact  that many of  those dead don't deserve  honor.-Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Magnell, 5th  District, New York.  As a combat veteran of WW II, I feel de based by President Reagan's decision to visit  the German cemetery that holds  the re mains of so many of the Nazi criminals of  that conflict    . We can never  let  the  world forget what the Germans of that era  did to humanity. To honor those who par ticipated  in that horror  is an insult, not  only to Americans, but to all people, all over  the world who value  the  right of every  human to be allowed to think and worship  according  to  his  own  beliefs.-Mr. Gil  Malawista, 5th District, New York.  I share the concern and opposition  expressed by my constituents. Cur rently,  there  are numerous  groups  trying to convince the world that the  Holocaust never took place. This of fensive and preposterous assertion is  sure to gain some acceptance if the  President lays a wreath at a cemetery  where members of the elite SS guard  are buried.  The fundamental lesson of the Holo caust is never again. As elected repre sentatives of our Nation, our responsi bility  is  to assure  that  this  lesson  never fades. I commend the gentleman  from California and New York for re serving this time so that this very ex pression may be relayed to the Presi dent.e,  e ",1985
639,1195,7,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today with a deep sense of outrage  at President Reagan's proposed plan  to visit the cemetery at Bitburg, Ger many. This  cemetery  contains  the  graves of German SS officers, the Nazi  elites who brutally carried out Hitler's  plan  to  exterminate  the  Jews  of  Europe. Regardless of the intent of in cluding Bitburg on  the President's  itinerary, or  the addition of other  events  to  the  schedule,  President  Reagan should immediately cancel his  plan to lay a wreath at Bitburg.  This month we have been commemo rating the 40th anniversary of the end  of World War II and the liberation of  the Nazi death camps. Part of remem bering the dead and the other victims  of nazism is never forgetting those re sponsible for the Holocaust. President  Reagan's plan to lay a wreath at Bit burg is far from a gesture of reconcili ation with modem Germany. Rather  it is opening the wounds of thousands  of Holocaust survivors and Gold Star  mothers everywhere. Furthermore, it  is paying homage to the memory of 47  Nazi SS members, participants in the  torture and murder of millions of in nocent people.  I have written personally to Presi dent Reagan asking him  to  remove  Bitburg  from  his  itinerary.  In my  letter I also encouraged him to do ev erything possible to continue our Na tion's friendship with present-day Ger many.  I do not believe  in collective  guilt. But I must join with Elie Wiesel  who said: ""The issue here is not poli tics, but good and evil."" The American  President's place is with the victims,  not  the perpetrators, of Nazi atroc ities.  Our current friendship with Germa ny does not make us forget the past.  Out of respect for those who died and  suffered, out of respect for the lessons  of the Holocaust, I join with my col leagues and friends in the Jewish com munity in calling for the President to  cancel his trip to Bitburg.e  e ",1985
640,1195,7,Mr. LENT.," Madam Speaker, I  join  with my colleagues today in express ing my deep concern over the Presi dent's plans to visit the Bitburg Ceme tery  in West Germany. The Presi dent's trip to Bitburg is  intended to  improve diplomatic relations with Ger many but  it has had  the opposite  effect here in the United States. The  President's stated intention to visit a  military  cemetery  in Bitburg  has  opened old wounds and sharply divid ed this Nation.  Some would portray this visit as an  issue of primary concern to the Jewish  community, but that is inaccurate. It  is a Jewish issue, but it is also an issue  of concern to gentiles. Many of the  major  veterans  organizations  have  protested against the President's visit.  They are disturbed because the Presi dent's visit would honor the murderers  of their fallen comrades, as well as the  perpetrators of  the most horrifying  slaughter in the history of mankind.  I  had  hoped  that  the  eloquent  speech given by Elie Wiesel at  the  White House last week would change  'r  ' '-'  ",1985

Cliff is a senior student-athlete at  St. Raymond High School  in  the  Bronx. Cliff's physical talents are dis played most vividly on the baseball  field,  where  his  accomplishments  earned him distinction as  the New  York Post's High School Athlete of  the Week. However, Cliff's accom plishments are not limited to the ball field. Cliff Gonzalez has close to a 90  average and also has a strong desire to  attain a college education before ful filling  his dream of  a  professional  baseball career. In these ways, Cliff  Gonzalez has earned our respect and  our admiration.  I would  like  to  extend my best  wishes to Cliff Gonzalez in his future  endeavors. For as the following article  accurately denotes, Cliff's enormous  talents will not end with high school.  CFrom the New York Post, Apr. 10,19851  POST HS ATHLETE OF WEEK  <By Steve Barenfeld)  Cliff Gonzalez can do it all-and last week  he did.

The Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended  <42 United States Code 3001 et seq.).  9759  For his outstanding performance, Gonza lez, is The Post's High School Athlete of the  Week.  Gonzalez, 5-10, 155 pounds, started poorly  last week, Batting third, he went O-for-2 in a  3-2 win  over Lehman on Tuesday. On  Wednesday,  the  lefthanded-hitter,  who  throws righty, went 2-for-3 and drove in a  run in St. Ray's 14-0 rout of St. Francis  Prep. The next day he again was 2-for-3  with a double and an RBI in a 3-2 victory  over George Washington.  But it was Saturday when Gonzalez really  started banging the ball. He went 3-for-3  with a homer, two doubles and an RBI in  the morning when St. Ray's beat Mcclaney.  Later in the day,  in the Monroe Tourna ment, he went 3-for-5 with another home  run and stole his lOOth career base in a 27-0  stroll past Norman Thomas.  He doesn't plan on letting up, either.  ""I think I can keep up this pace,"" said  Gonzalez, who will be 18 next Thursday.  ""This is my last year and I want to leave  with a bang.""  There's no reason why he can't. Gonzalez,  who hit .454 last season, is a marvelous ath lete who  already was  considered major  league material. But he has gotten better.  ""I know  I've  improved  tremendously,""  Gonzalez said. ""This past winter I worked  on Nautilus and improved my strength. I'm  also  smarter and more  selective at  the  plate.""  ""He's the best player I've ever had,"" said  Raven coach Ron Patnosh, who  is  in his  18th year.  ""He does everything. He can  run-he goes from home to first in 3.8. He  hits for power and average. He has a major  league arm.""  ""I think he has a good shot to get draft ed.""  So does Gonzalez, but that doesn't mean  he""ll go right for a pro career.  ""If the money's right-over $40,000-1  would sign,"" he said.  ""But if not, I'll go to college,""  Seton Hall, St. John's, Oklahoma State  and Old Dominion have offered him full  scholarships. But Gonzalez, who has close  to a 90 average, would like to go to Yale.  ""I'd like to be a business person,"" he said.  ""I know they have an average baseball pro gram, but I don't think where you play in  college makes that much of a difference.  You really develop in summer leagues.  ""I've  always  loved  baseball,  and my  friends get mad at me because I'm always  either playing or watching on TV, I'd love to  play major league ball and I feel I have a  very good shot.""

669,1234,7,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, how pleasurable it is to be able to  laud and commemorate a resident of  my  congressional  district who  has  combined all of the noble aspects of  community  service,  professional  at tainment, family achievement and. a  fulfilling life. We are pleased to join  family, friends and associates of Royce  Smith in saluting him on the occasion  of his retirement from government.  Very few  individuals can take with  them  the  satisfaction which  comes  from duty faithfully performed. But  Royce Smith is able to do this based  upon his record as Belleville council man, Belleville mayor, member of the  Wayne County Board of Commission ers  and managing  director  of  the  April 29, 1985  Wayne County Department of Public  Works.  Many people are satisfied to achieve  either in the private sector or in public  office holding. Seldom do we see the  remarkable blend of both public and  private achievement, intertwined with  responsible partisanship on behalf of  the 15th District Democratic organiza tion.  We know that Royce and his family  now look forward  to his well-earned  respite from his official duties. But in  another sense he will never depart  from the special job and pleasure he  derives from his family and the satis faction  he  derives  from  assisting  others.e  THE TREASURY'S TAX PROPOS AL WOULD HURT OHIO OIL  AND GAS INDUSTRY  HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 29, 1985  e ",1985
670,1234,7,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, the  Treasury Department's new tax pro posal would severely  impact  the oil  and gas industry in my home State of  Ohio-an industry which just enjoyed  its finest year ever. I rise today to ex press my opposition  to  three major  components of  the Treasury's plan  that would have wide-ranging negative  effects in the oil and gas industry in  Ohio.  The Treasury's  tax plan  includes  three proposals that I am very con cerned about. They are: First, loss of  intangible  drilling  cost  deduction;  second, repeal of statutory depletion;  and third, elimination of investment  tax credit. These three proposals,  if  enacted, would be a severe blow to the  fiscal health of Ohio's oil and gas in dustry. A recent survey by the Ohio  Oil and Gas Association regarding the  Treasury's proposals  revealed  some  disturbing  information.  If enacted,  these proposals would have the follow ing effects: First, expenditures for oil  and gas production in Ohio would de cline  by  72  percent;  second,  the  number of new wells in Ohio would de cline by 71 percent;  third,  revenues  paid  to  related  industries  in Ohio  would  decline  by  54  percent;  and  fourth, employment in the industry in  Ohio would be cut by 43 percent.  While all of the above facts are quite  disturbing, I am most concerned about  the unacceptable amount of jobs that  'would be lost and the grave reduction  in oil and gas production in Ohio. In  my home district the unemployment  has been one of the highest  in the  Nation for several years. The State of  Ohio  is struggling to catch up with  this so-called economic recovery. The  oil and gas industry had been a steady  part of Ohio's economic growth. If the  ",1985

673,1260,7,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Speaker,  today  we appear to be launched on a reckless  course, one which cannot help but de stroy comity, probity, and trust in the  House. While we thumb our noses at  the laws of the sovereign State of Indi ana and seat a man who did not con test the loss of his election, we send a  signal of arrogance and disregard of  the basic guarantees of the liberties  and rights of our citizens. The body of  justice lies bleeding, impaled upon the  sword of partisan politics.  Mr. Speaker, let us turn from this  reckless course. Even the newspapers  in California have moved on this. Take  heed.  A TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST  NICARAGUA  <Mr. MAZZOLI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
674,1260,7,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, along with a majority of my col leagues in the House, I voted against  military assistance for the Contras in  Nicaragua. I did so with trepidation  and with a certain amount of reserve  because that is a villainous, oppressive  government,  a  godless  government,  and it should not take any aid and  comfort from that vote.  I voted as I did in large part because  I do not think we have done every thing short of military action to indi cate our disrespect for  that govern ment and to try to replace it with a  democratic form of government.  I, for example, would suggest that  the American people would be amazed  to know that the No. 1 trading partner  of Nicaragua is the United States. De pending on whose view you take, we  export up to $120 million a year and  import some $60 million a year from  Nicaragua.  I think the average American would  be amazed to know that our Embassy  is open and doing business in Mana gua.  And,  I  think the people would be  amazed to know that you can board an  airplane and fly  into Managua very  freely and openly.  I, for one, Mr. Speaker, suggest to  the President that there be an imme diate  trade embargo ordered against  Nicaragua in which we would ask our  partners and allies  in  the world  to  join. I believe commercial airline serv ice ought to be cut off to Nicaragua  from the United States.   Mr. Speaker, we have spoken with a  garbled message. Up till now we have  condemned  the Sandinistas and ar ranged trade deals with them all in  the same breath, I think now we have  to  speak with  a  very  clear  voice  against the Sandinistas. Let's not con fuse the issue.  EX IN MEDIA  VOICES  JOIN  IN  PRESSING CONCERN OVER  DIANA ELECTION CASE  <Mr. COBLE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
675,1260,7,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, addressing  the concern over the manner in which  the Mcintyre fiasco has been mishan dled, is that concern reserved for Re publicans and the isolated Democrats  on this floor who have stood with us?  No, indeed not.  The New York Times,  the Wall  Street Journal,  the Evansville Press,  the Detroit News,  the Washington  Post, the Denver Post, the Philadel phia Inquirer, the Bakersfield Califor nian, the Washington Times, the Flor ida Times-Union, the Baltimore Sun,  and the Greensboro News Record in  my district, among others, have ex pressed concern about where there is  ""something rotten."" In this case it is  not in Denmark, I  fear, but on the  floor of this House. These diverse edi torial voices have cried out.  Mr. Speaker, there is still time for us  to exercise an honorable role and con duct a special election to see who in  fact should occupy this seat to repre sent the citizens of the Eighth District  of Indiana.  REAGAN URGED AGAIN TO  CANCEL BITBURG VISITATION  <Mr. MARKEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1985
676,1260,7,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  President, more than anyone else, un derstands the power of symbols and  gestures. This  is  one gesture  that  should not be made, one symbol that  should not be honored.  Germany has  traveled  light-years  since the horrors of Hitler's reign.  Do not resurrect the nightmare of  nazism, Mr. President. The focus of  your vist should not be the horrors of  the past but the achievements of the  present and  the challenges of  the  future.  It does no good to try to balance the  visit with a visit  to a concentration  camp. It is morally shallow to reduce  the time spent at the Bitburg Ceme tery  and  to  increase  the  time  at  Bergen-Belsen-as if to say there are  two sides to this issue and we are going  to strike a balance between the perpe trators of the Nazi Holocaust and its  victims.  Mr. speaker, it is morally blind to  say that the SS were as much victims  of Hitler as his victims in the concen tration camps.  ",1985

679,1273,7,Mr. KEMP., I yield to the gentleman  from California.  ,1985
680,1273,7,Mr. THOMAS of California.," I thank  the Gentleman from New York CMr.  KEMP] our distinguished Conference  chairman for yielding.  Briefly, I think it is extremely inter esting that the gentleman who  just  left the well, the gentleman from Illi nois CMr. DURBIN], prior to the result  being known, argued passionately in  the well that we ought not to let 40  ghost votes make the difference. Yet  today he certainly abides by the deci sion and in fact those 40-plus ghost  votes were added by a 2-to-1 partisan  vote, 2 Democrats, 1 Republican.  Interestingly  enough,  he  said we  ought not to have a preponderance of  the evidence make the decision in this  case. It is the Contested Elections Act,  the Federal Contested ElectiQns Act  that uses  just that as  the criterion.  And  if the fell ow who lost the race  election night, and on recount night  Mr. Mccloskey had utilized that vehi cle the House has provided: the Feder al Contested Elections Act, he would  have been required to show a prepon derance of the evidence.  Instead we have been brought here  by a straight majority vote and there  is no need to show any evidence be cause  if the majority has one more  vote they win.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1985
681,1273,7,Mr. DURBIN., Will  the gentleman  yield?  ,1985
682,1273,7,Mr. KEMP.," Let me make my state ment and then I will be glad to yield.  Let me  say  to my colleagues on  behalf of our conference  there has  been no civil disobedience. There has  been no one chaining themselves  to  anything around here and while all of  us were deeply outraged and upset our  Members have conducted  themselves  with dignity and grace under pressure.  We are all bound on both sides of  the political aisle by our respect for  the law. This government of laws is  precious to all of us. A great English  philosopher one  time said  that  the  purpose of law is not to restrict free dom or to restrain freedom; the pur pose of the law is to enhance and en large freedom because, he went on to  say, where there is no law there can be  no  freedom because anarchy  is  the  result of an absence of law.  The not seating of Rick Mcintyre on  January 3 was an act of anarchy, the  absence of law.  We Republicans offer this Frenzel  motion to vacate the seat in Indiana's  Eighth Congressional District in the  hope that fairness, honor, and the law  will prevail on this issue. The actions  that we as a conference have under taken this past week were not taken  lightly. We have been forced to these  actions to disrupt the agenda of the  House and the legislative process  in  order to slow down and hopefully stop  the inexorable march to an injustice  that the majority seeks to impose in  seating Mr. Mccloskey.  There  are  unanswered  questions,  confusing arguments and ambiguities  that require a special election.  The proposal of the House Adminis tration Committee to seat Mccloskey  confirms all the worst fears the people  of our country have had since the 99th  Congress  first met  on  January  3.  Acting  like  a  kangaroo  court,  the  Democratic members of the task force  have abrogated Indiana State law, and  now  it appears  that  they want  to  throw out the Constitution, too.  Through a series of special rules, ad mittedly applied differently, and we  argue  inconsistently,  the  task  force  counted votes until Mr. Mccloskey  was four votes ahead. Everyone agrees  they then stopped counting and left 32  ballots uncounted. 'Reasonable people  can disagree but there is no precedent  for what happened and what has gone  on  these past few months. Nothing  but arrogance and Lord Acton's adage  that absolute powerl corrupts absolute ly can explain the actions taken by the  majority.  D 1500  This Frenzel resolution to vacate the  seat is the only alternative to a motion  tomorrow to seat the loser of a fair  election over the winner of a fair ~lec­ tion.  One can understand that close elec tions present a great temptation. But  for 200 years majorities in this coun try have resisted the temptation to cut  down all the laws and establish their  own standards in order to ensure the  desired results.  Some words to the wise: In Robert  Bolt's masterful play, ""A Man for All  Seasons,'' there  is an exchange be tween Sir Thomas More and young  Will Roper his son-in-law who  tells  More that he would cut down every  law in England to get to the Devil.  Sir Thomas More  reproaches him  and says, ""And when the last law was  down, and the Devil turned round on  you, where would you hide, Roper, the  laws all being flat?        d'you really  think you could stand upright in the  winds that would blow then?"" I ask my  Democratic colleagues to think care fully before they cut down the laws  that protect all of us, equally majority  and minority alike.  Please consider the atmosphere you  create by  this act of  injustice and  greed, the goodwill necessary for men  and women who differ to work togeth er is  irreparably torn. In a Govern ment like ours, the rights of the mi nority must not be sacrificed. When  the mutual trust and respect for the  rules of the game are destroyed the  understanding needed to work togeth er  is destroyed. And  then not only  Rick Mcintyre's constituents but all  the people will suffer.  My colleagues on  the Democratic  side of the aisle have a chance to re store justice and honor to this body.  Let us vote to vacate the seat and have  a special election.  ",1985
683,1273,7,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  3 minutes  to  the gentleman  from  Michigan [Mr. LEvIN].  ",1985
684,1273,7,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er,  I am a  friend of Frank McClos key's, and it was because of that when  I approached the report, I tried to do  so with special care and special objec tivity.  Among the questions I asked were  these: If Mr. Mcintyre had won by  four votes, would I have voted to seat  him? The answer is yes. And I am con fident the majority party would have  done so.  I asked a second question: Did the  minority suggest before the end of the  court, before  the end of the count,  that if there were a razor-thin vote for  Mr. Mcintyre, there should be a spe cial election? And the answer is no;  quite the contrary. Here is what the  minority member of  the  task  force  early on had to say about a special  election:  I think that anyone who says we are not  going to be able to seat someone and there fore we ought to start talking about special  elections  to my mind not only being  unfair to the difficult task we have in front  of us, but I would attribute some sinister  motives to that kind of talk.  is  So, two things in terms of that state ment. It was not until the count was  completed that there was talk on the  minority side of a special election.  Second,  and  very  importantly,  throughout there has been a comment  from the minority side that those on  the majority side are beset by sinister  motivations.  In my judgment, there is reason for  argument here, for a decent difference  of opinion, but not for vilification or  vituperation.  I am concerned with the tone of this  debate, what it could mean for issues  that lie ahead, where bipartisanship is  needed.  I am confident of my position. I have.  a belief in the integrity of the mem bers of  the  task  force. Therefore,  those who throw stones at the majori ty are throwing them instead at this  .  ",1985

689,1299,7,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, for  more than 50 years, the Selfhelp Com munity  Services  Organization  has  been helping New York area survivors  of  the Holocaust. This organization  was founded by a group of Quakers  and immigrant Jews to help victims of  Nazi persecution. In the early days of  its existence, Selfhelp provided a place  for those fleeing the Germans. It was  a place to come and seek shelter in a  strange,  new  country. At Selfhelp,  these  refugees  found  people with  whom they could communicate. The  social workers not only spoke German,  but also Yiddish, Russian, Hungarian  and Polish. The Selfhelp Community  Organization provided badly needed  services to those fleeing the Holocaust.  The end of the war and the end of  the Holocaust did not end the need for  the services of Selfhelp. Selfhelp still  provides services to those whose emo tional scars are still open. Many survi vors are still haunted by nightmares  and often a persistent feeling of guilt  exists within them. They feel guilty  because they survived when so many  did not. There are many institutions  and  daily  events  that  bring  back  memories of Nazi Germany. As one of  Selfhelp's social workers put it, ""ill ness  triggers feelings of helplessness  that they had in Germany. Sickness  meant immediate death at the hands  of the Nazis."" As these survivors grow  older, Selfhelp provides  them assist ance with  government  documents.  Government documents  in Germany  could  have meant  deportation  or  death.  There are people who live with this  tragedy of history every day, with the  emotional scars that will last the rest  of their lives. Because the disease is  gone does not mean we are immune to  it. Genocide could raise its ugly head  at any time. Just as the Selfhelp Com munity Service Organization continues  to respond to the effects of the Holo caust, so must we respond. The need is  still there. I urge quick action on the  long overdue Genocide Convention.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  RECOGNITION OF SENATOR  BAUCUS  ",1985

691,1299,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I rise  to introduce a  resolution for myself,  Senator BENTSEN, and Senator MOYNI HAN, calling on the President to initi ate discussion of the exchange rates at  the Bonn Economic Summit.  This resolution is designed to send a  message  to  the  President  -of  the  United States. A message I and my col leagues hope he hears as he goes into  the Bonn Economic Summit.  It is a message drawn from pain pain caused by  this administration's  policies. It is a message about moving  to stop the pain from getting worse.  Wednesday night President Reagan  spoke to the American people about  the  costs  imposed  by  skyrocketing  budget deficits-deficits contained  in  his budgets. But he ignored one cost:  the  cost  imposed  by  his  deficits'  impact on the dollar.  Perhaps I should not have been sur prised. After all, for 4 years-as the  dollar  has  risen  ever  higher-the  President has seen no problem. He has  even said we should be proud of the  dollar's high value!  Well, we stand here today to say to  the President of  the United States:  ""You are living in a dream world-re moved from the reality that confronts  most Americans.''  Take off your rose-colored glasses!  Leave  the oval office and go among  the American  farmers-good people,  hardworking people and the most pro ductive people in the world. They will  tell you an overvalued dollar  is  a  source not of pride but of pain and  bankruptcy.  Go to a Caterpillar plant. Talk to  the men and women who have spent  their lives making the best tractors in  the world. Ask them if watching the  overvalued dollar drive their jobs over seas, has made them proud.  Ask the American worker who has  foregone a rise or taken a paycut to  protect his job, only to see it disappear  offshore. Ask him if he feels pride tn  an overvalued dollar.  Or ask Eastman Kodak Co. if achiev ing a 13-percent increase in productivi ty in 1 year and then watching a rise  in the dollar swamp that gain makes  them feel proud.  Ask the millions of Americans who  have lost jobs to imports if they feel  pride in the overvalue of the dollar.  The answer, Mr. President, would be  a resounding ""No.""  The American farmer, the American  manufacturer,  and  the  American  worker all cry out in pain. The pain of  lost sales, lost profits,  lost jobs-lost  not because of  inefficiency or rising  costs, but because this President's poli cies have put a  tax on the products  they try to ship overseas.

725,1325,7,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, it is  almost as difficult to follow what has  been happening on the floor now as it  is  to follow the chart of the tree of  amendments that the majority leader  keeps referring to and inspecting on  the desk.  Let me  curred.  The first vote of the Senate respect ing  the budget  resolution has now  been held on the issue of Social Secu rity. Virtually all Democrats voted to  bring up the Moynihan-Riegle amend ment that would give Social Security  recipients a full cost-of-living increase.  All Republicans voted against bringing  up the Moynihan-Riegle Social Securi ty amendment.  This may be an arcane, inside parlia mentary victory for the Republicans,  but the fact is that it is the first step  in  the defeat for President Reagan.  summarize what has oc addressed  the  The fact is that the Republicans want  to thwart Democratic efforts to undo  what Ronald Reagan wants to do on  Social Security, cut the COLA's, be cause certain Republicans want to get  the credit for undoing what Ronald  Reagan wants to do with Social Secu rity.  The Republicans  have  offered  a  budget package negotiated with Presi dent Reagan that reduces the value of  Social Security by denying  the  full  cost-of-living  increase. That  dimin ishes the purchasing power of every  Social  Security  check  received  by  every Social Security recipient. There fore, it is tampering with Social Secu rity.  But the Republican intention is to  give Members of their own party the  first opportunity to amend the budget  package to grant a full COLA. They  want a Republican name on the Social  Security amendment.  I  submit  that  that would be a false label.  They want a Republican name on a  Social Security amendment that their  own President opposes. They want a  Republican name on a Social Security  amendment  that  they  refuse  to  in clude in their Republican budget pack age.  The Senator from New Mexico [Mr.  DoMEN1c1l  just stated that 60  to 70  percent of Republicans want a budget  package that will freeze Social Securi ty COLA's-not even grant the 2-per cent increase that is proposed in the  package, but freeze  them. Obviously,  these Republicans must depend on  Democratic votes to pass their Social  Security amendment to get them off  the political hook upon which  they  now find theinselves impaled.  Mr. President, I say we need truth in  labeling in the Senate. The Social Se curity amendment we vote on should  be  the Democratic Moynihan-Riegle  amendment.  Let me briefly respond to this ques tion: Why do most Democrats and  some Republicans favor a full COLA  for Social Security recipients? First,  for  all  the  reasons  that Ronald  Reagan was advancing throughout his  campaign and stayed with until very  recently. As the President has stated,  the Social Security fund has a surplus.  It has nothing to do with the deficit,  and it has its own separate trust fund  that is not part of the overall Federal  budget.  Second,  another  reason,  not  ad vanced by the President, is that some thing like one-third of Social Security  recipients are getting 90 percent of  what they live on from Social Securi ty. They are old or they are totally dis abled, they are unable to work now,  and most are unable  to  find other  sources of income. The average Social  Security check  is  $450  a month-a  little bit less than that. We all know it  is hard to make do on $450 a month.  The fact  is  that, according  to the  Congressional Budget Office,  if  the  COLA is granted only halfway as the  Republican package proposes, approxi mately 575,000 senior citizens would be  pushed below the poverty line. That  would be something like 75,000 Cali fornians.  Mr. President, I oppose that happen ing  to  any American.  I  certainly  oppose its happening to any Californi an.  ",1985

727,1325,7,The VICE PRESIDENT.," The Sena tor from New Mexico.  Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President,  I  yield myself time off the amendment.  I do not know of any Republicans who  desire  to speak at  this  time. Once  again, I would say if there are any on  our side who desire to speak with ref erence to the pending amendment or  the problem we are confronted with in  terins of  the deficit, we have some  time now.  In deference to making sure that the  record  is  correct,  the distinguished  Senator  from California would not  yield for a question as he spoke, and I  understand that. But I believe I said  55 to 60 U.S. Senators from both sides  of the aisle, in my opinion, are for and  will vote for a cost-of-living freeze on  Social Security. I believe there will be  substantial numbers from that side of  the aisle. It is just that they will do  that only in the context of the kind of  budget that they support.  I did not say 60 percent of the Re publicans or 60 percent of the Demo crats. I  just said there are a number  for Senator HOLLINGS'  amendment,  which is an entire package, a freeze;  there  is another group of Senators  that are for the Chiles proposal, which  has a Social Security freeze with a  small reserve. I  think when you are  through adding those up, you will find  that my rough estimate as of tonight  will be correct and, if anything, it will  be on the short side.  Mr. President, this week we embark  on one of the most important debates  of the past 40 years. The outcome of  this debate may well determine  the  economic health and vitality of  the  Nation for  the rest of this century.  Unlike many debates,  in which we  battle over fundamental goals or ob jectives, this debate will focus on dif ferent ways to reach what everyone in  the Senate has agreed  is our  final  goal-large deficit reduction this year  and in the years to come.  Indeed, when we began this year's  budget deliberations back in January,  our leadership established a very clear  goal. That goal was embodied in S. 1  as introduced by our distinguished ma jority leader and which I cosponsored.  That goal, simply stated, was and is  that deficits must be reduced as a per",1985

733,1377,7,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I am in troducing a resolution today which is  long overdue and is a symbol of my  concern  that our Nation's Vietnam  veterans be afforded the recognition  they are due for their patriotic service.  Next Tuesday, May 7, 1985, marks  the 10th anniversary of the official  end of America's involvement in the  conflict in Vietnam. Some 3.4 million  American men and women served in  the Vietnam theater during that long  war-the longest conflict this Nation  has been involved in since we gained  our independence. More than 57 ,000  Americans lost their lives there, and  an additional 2,400 Americans are still  listed as missing in action in South west Asia. Some 300,000 were wounded  and some 75,000 have incurred perma51-059 0-86-44 (pt, 7)  nent physical disabilities as a result of  their service. Many more  thousands  still suffer psychological harm result ing from their experiences in Vietnam.  Regardless of the ultimate verdict of  history about U.S. involvement in that  war, the service that patriotic Ameri cans performed is deserving of their  country's recognition.  Mr. President, the Nation is now be ginning to review in a more dispassion ate and even-handed manner the his tory of our involvement in the Viet nam conflict. We are still learning the  lessons of that conflict. For too long  we have  taken the painless road of  avoiding that history. It is a healthy  sign, I believe, that there has been a  recent upsurge  in commentary and  analysis of our role in Vietnam. If we  cannot examine our past, then we will  be unable  to chart our future with  wisdom.  It is, then, ~ppropriate that we now  take steps to honor our veterans, and  the memory of  those who did not  return from Vietnam. This resolution  would designate next Tuesday, May 7,  as  ""Vietnam Veterans Recognition  Day."" It is a modest measure, but an  essential step in the healing process  which is so important for our country.  The text of the joint resolution in troduced by Mr. BYRD, for himself, Mr.  CRANSTON, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. ROCKEFEL LER, Mr. EXON, Mr. DIXON, Mr. NUNN,  and Mr. HOLLINGS, follows:  as missing  S.J. RES. 128  Whereas over 3 million American fighting  men and women who served in the Vietnam  theatre for over a decade acquitted them selves in the highest traditions of. American  service personnel;  Whereas more than 57 ,000 Americans lost  their lives  there, and an additional 2,400  Americans  are  still  listed  in  action in Southeast Asia.  Whereas thousands of Vietnam veterans  still suffer physically and psychologically  from the effects of the war, including many  who are permanently disabled;  Whereas regardless of the ultimate verdict  of history about United States involvement  in that war, the service that patriotic Amer icans performed in the Vietnam theatre is  deserving of continued and  reemphasized  grateful recognition;  Whereas the nation is now beginning to  review  in a more dispassionate and even handed manner the history of our involve ment in the Vietnam conflict;  Whereas for too long the nation failed to  honor the service of and respond appropri ately to the needs of Vietnam veterans and  was instead anxious to place the Vietnam  experience behind it;  Whereas May 7, 1985 marks the tenth an niversary of the official end of America's in volvement in the conflict in Vietnam:  Now,  therefore, be  it Resolved by  the  Senate and the House of Representatives of  the United States of America in Congress as sembled, That May 7, 1985  is designated  ""Vietnam Veterans Recognition Day"" and  the President is authorized and requested to  issue a proclamation calling upon the people  of the United States to observe such a day  with appropriate activities.  <Conclusion of earlier proceedings.)

RONALD REAGAN,  Tm: WHITE HOUSE, April 30, 1985.  ",1985
736,1390,7,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President,  I  speak today as sponsor of a concurrent  resolution  regarding Americans  still  missing and unaeco.unted for in South east Asia. Today is particularly signifi cant in the life of the Nation, because  it marks the 10th anniversary of the  U.S. departure from Saigon. The truth  is, Mr. President,  the United States  really did not depart Vietnam because,  as we are all aware, there are nearly  2,500 Americans still missing and un accounted for in Indochina. President  Reagan has assigned the highest na tional priority to the effort to obtain  the  fullest  possible  accounting  of  these missing Americans and he has  pledged his  full  resources  for  this  report.  Mr. President, my concurrent resolu tion simply reaffirms the President's  commitment to our POW /MiA's and  reinforces congressional priorities for  our POW /MIA's; namely,  to  bring  home any Americans who remain in  captivity; to have the fullest possible  accounting of  the missing;  and  to  return the remains of those who died  in Indochina home to us in the United  States.    Mr. President,  in 1984,  six North  Dakota  servicemen  listed  as POW/  MIA's in Southeast Asia were honored  with a special congressional medal pre sented  to  their  families  at Grand  Forks Air Force Base. All of those still  unaccounted for in Southeast Asia de serve far more than medals. For they  are  true American heroes who have  performed above and beyond he call of  duty for their country. Mr. President,  they are the giants in whose shadow  all Americans stand.  Mr. President, the State Department  has indicated that Vietnam and Laos  have agreed to cooperate in account ing for the missing in their countries.  We applaud that pledge of coopera tion. But we also recognize how pain fully slow that pro~ess will be. There fore, the United States must continue  to press Vietnam and Laos to proceed  with all deliberate speed with their ac counting. Tbis concurrent resolution  urges them to do just that.  ,  Mr. President, our great American  poet Carl Sandburg wrote that ""Valor  is a gift. Those having it never know  for sure whether they have it till the  test comes."" The  test has come for  almost 2,500 Americans. And if indeed  valor is a gift, it is one that has been  given to all Americans by these brave  individuals.  We have not forgotten their ongoing  sacrifice and we will never forget our  debt to them.  ",1985
737,1403,7,Mr.  SIMON.," Mr.  President,  on  March 18, 1985, Marian Wright Edel man, president of the Children's De fense Fund, and a leader in the move ment to secure the rights of children  in poverty, spoke at the Woman's Na tional Democratic Club in an eloquent  way about  the  impact of President  Reagan's fiscal year 1986 budget on  poor children. With child poverty at  the highest rate in 18 years, President  Reagan has intentionally or uninten tionally  targeted poor children and  families for the fifth consecutive year  for billions in new budget cuts. This  occurs at a time when the cost of lift ing every poor American child out of  poverty would be less than half of the  proposed increase in defense spending  in 1986. This occurs at a time when a  single working mother with three chil dren and a below-poverty  income of  $10,500 paid $1,186 in taxes, more than  Boeing,  General  Electric, DuPont,  Texaco, Mobil, and AT&T  together  paid in 1983, though earnings of these  huge corporations totaled $13.7 billion  in net profits.  No Senator or Representative can  turn his or her back on Ms. Edelman's  message  to  the Woman's National  Democratic Club and to the American  people.  I  respectfully  urge  your  thoughtful attention  to  the speech,  and ask  that  it be printed  in  the  RECORD.  The Speech follows:  SPEECH BY MARIAN WRIGHT EDELllrlAN,  PRESIDENT CHILDREN'S DEFENSE F'uND  1986  President Reagan's Fiscal Year  budget is a moral travesty.  Although more children die each year  from poverty  than from  traffic fatalities  and suicide combined-twice more children  die from poverty than die from heart dis ease and cancer combined-for  the  fifth  consecutive year, in the face of the highest  child poverty rate  in 18 years, President  Reagan has targeted poor children and fam ilies again for billions in new budget cuts.  Under  the  Fiscal Year  1986 Reagan  budget, children will  lose $5.2 billion. In  1990, children will lose $37.6 billion in feder al support. This is on top of $10 billion a  year in cuts already made in survival pro grams for children and families since 1980.  If the Reagan budget priorities succeed,  by 1990 every American will be spending 19  percent less on poor children and families  and 86 percent more on defense.  By Fiscal Year 1990, the military budget  will increase by $344.2 billion or 239 percent,  to make American children more secure  from external enemies. But American chil dren also need defense against internal en emies of poverty,  infant mortality, abuse,  and homelessness.  Over a  five-year period, more American  children die from poverty  than the total  number of American battle deaths in the  Vietnam War. Yet, our national  leaders  dream about a multi-billion dollar ""Star  Wars"" system to make our defenses impen etrable against enemy missiles. Why can't  they dream of a  smaller achievable war  against child poverty-a war that saves and  enhances rather than takes and threatens  human  life? Every poor American  child  could be lifted out of poverty in 1986 for  less  than half of  the proposed defense  spending increase for that one year alone.  American babies need defense against pre ventable infant mortality and birth defects.  By 1990, 22,000 American babies will die pri marily because of low birthweight. We can  prevent at least one in eight of these infant  deaths and thousands of handicapping con tributions simply by providing their moth ers prenatal care. For seven percent or 25  days of the defense budget increase next  year, every poor mother and baby could be  provided Medicaid, and thus prenatal care  coverage. Instead, the Reagan budget pro",1985

739,1429,7,Mr.  PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  today I  am introducing the Universal Health  Insurance Act of 1985. This bill is an  updated and, I think, improved version  of a similar bill I introduced in the last  Congress. The purpose of today's bill  is  to make  the benefits  of  group  health  insurance available  to every one.  While I  recognize  that budget im peratives make it unlikely that Con gress can take favorable action on a  proposal such as this one, the need for  expanded access to health care is great  and  growing  larger.  The  existing  health care delivery system now pro vides f.or the health needs of a majori ty of Americans, either through the  commercial  insurance  industry  or  through governmental programs such  as Medicare and Medicaid. People who  are uninsured or underinsured reflect  a major shortcoming of that system.  One explanation for this shortcom ing is unemployment, which remains  high. While many of those who lost  jobs during the recent recession are  back at work, many are working in so called ""soft"" jobs. Too often those soft  jobs off er minimal or no employee  benefits. In the year since I introduced  this measure for the first time, I have  become more convinced than ever that  expanded access to basic health insur ance coverage is a very real need.  I  think it is vitally important that  we focus attention on this need. It is  my hope that my bill will continue to  remind us of this nagging problem.  The time will come when Congress  can respond  to  this problem. When  that happens, I believe that we should  build on our existing private health in surance industry. We do not need an other Federal health bureaucracy.  Let me briefly explain how the bill  would work:  Every citizen and legal resident of  the United States would be eligible to  enroll in a health insurance program  offered by a commercial insurance car rier. The Federal Government would  set uniform national benefit standards  and would  award  competitively bid  9967  contracts to private carriers to off er  plans in service areas which would be  established in each State.  Any insurance plan under the pro gram would be required to include cov erage  for  inpatient  and outpatient  hospital services, maternal an~ postna tal care, diagnostic services, and pro tection against catastrophic medical  expenses.  The  program would  be  financed  from  three sources. First, central to  the concept would be the requirement  that every participant would pay for  the insurance offered under the pro gram according  to  financial  ability.  The  rate established under my bill  would be 7 percent of  income. For  family  coverage,  the  income of all  family members covered would be in cluded to compute the cost for partici pants. In addition, the value of an in dividual's net assets, minus a reasona ble exclusion  for  the primary  resi dence and personal automobiles, would  be treated as income for the purpose  of determining that amount.  The second part of  the financing  plan would be to continue the 8-cent  per pack cigarette excise tax currently  scheduled  to expire  later  this year,  and dedicate the resulting revenue to  the program. The remaining portion  of the cost would be provided from the  general fund of the Treasury.  I am offering this plan because I be lieve  that it provides a way  to deal  with a serious and pressing national  problem. My plan  is  fair  in  its ap proach, uncomplicated  in  its execu tion, and comprehensive in achieving  its purpose. Obviously, deficit reduc tion measures must take precedence. I  am presenting my plan at this time be cause I want the discussion of a na tional group health insurance plan to  continue. I ask you consideration of  my proposal for the time when Con gress will inevitably have to face this  issue.e  JOINT  RESOLUTION  TO  PRE VENT FOREIGN POWERS FROM  COLONIZING  OR  CONTROL LING  COUNTRIES  AND  PEO PLES  IN THE WESTERN HEMI SPHERE   HON.

741,1442,7,Mr. DOWDY  of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, today I would like to honor  my  friends at  the Tylertown First  Baptist Church on a very special occa sion-the 75th anniversary of  their  founding.  In 1910, the Gutter family arrived in  Tylertown,  where  they  discovered  there was no Baptist Church. The late  Brother George Gutter searched for a  place where  the  community might  worship. He found a cattleshed and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  began working  to  renovate  it. One  table, one chair, and some lamps were  donated by friends. Sawdust was used  for  flooring;  kerosene  lamps were  mounted on posts as a source of light.  The walls of  the building were  re moved, and this gave enough material  so that several seats could be built.  In 1913, the church moved to a new  site. A  small wooden structure was  built. Two charter members are sisters  Georgia Gutter Smith  and Mamie  Gutter Moss.  Rev.  Jesse Dillon was  the  first  pastor. Brother George Gutter was  the first deacon. Other pastors were  Rev. G.W. Holden, Rev. L.R. McEwen,  Rev.  James  Pittman,  Rev.  Hivey  Carson, and Rev. Walter Smith, who is  currently serving. Financial secretaries  included Brothers Jesse Allen, Willard  April 30, 1985  Ratliff, Sisters Cleo Allen, and Elsie  Qualls.  Newly ordained deacons are Earnest  Qualls, Sr., A.T. Smith, and Lawyer  Ratliff.  The first women  to serve on  the  Mothers' Board were Mrs. Frankey  Gutter and Mrs. Letha Buckles. Pres ently the church mothers include Mrs.  Cleo Allen, Mrs. Beatrice Holmes, and  Mrs. Georgia Smith. Mrs. Rennetta  Taylor presently serves as correspond ing secretary. Brother A.T. Smith is  the current treasurer.  I know my colleagues here in Con gress join me in offering our prayers  and heartfelt congratulations to Rev erend Smith and all of the members of  the Tylertown First Baptist Church  on their 75th anniversary.e  I I  \  ",1985

746,30,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1985
747,30,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, it is ob vious that we have a lot of problems  here. I just think what we have done  today in this act, what was adopted in  the  committee  lets  one  group  of  people,  very  select  group-nothing  about equity, fairness, one select spe cialized group, not in nursing homes,  not  living at home, not  living with  their children, not living in an apart ment-one little group that puts up  the $90,000 in a savings account, but  the savings account is called a deposit,  can withdraw  it any  time and  that  group gets the interest on that deposit  tax free. Now that just is not right.  Mr. President, I think we have real  problems in accommodating the elder ly in this Nation. I challenge anybody  in this Senate to have more concern  over the living conditions and fate of  the elderly than I have. Therefore, I  think we ought to have hearings and  see what kind of a path we can follow  that really takes care of the elderly,  not some little special gimmick that  comes in and takes care of this select  few that happens to be living in profit  or  nonprofit  establishments  called  continuing care facilities.  We pointed out earlier in the debate  the  abuses  that could  come  about  here. A person could have $200,000 on  deposit. The Marriott's latest facility  could require a $200,000 deposit and  $1,000 a month, $500 a month, what ever. That person gets the first $90,000  of that tax free. What a bonanza for  the wealthy. A  person  has  other  income of all sorts, but that $90,000,  even if he is in the 50-percent bracket,  is tax free. The widow at home, barely  getting by,  just nursing along  that  nest egg of $90,000, all she has got, no  more, no other income, in the 14-per cent bracket or whatever it is, 20-per cent bracket, and she is subject to the  full tax.  Now, if the manager of the bill can  tell me that is fair, I challenge him to  do so.  When  he  chooses  to  respond,  I  would ask him, once we get by this tax  reform measure,  if we  cannot have  some hearings in the Tax Committee  on some kind of a program that will  encourage the elderly to live in facili ties, of varied kinds that might be con cocted by the committee, in some way  to better  take  care  of  themselves.  Maybe it will be an IRA. The manager  of  the bill,  the floor manager says,  ""What I proposed and the bill I have  got before the desk is a $90,000 IRA,  Individual Retirement Account Act.""  Sure,  that  is what  it  is. Maybe we  ought to do that. Maybe it ought to be  more.  But clearly we  have not  let our  imaginations  function  thoroughly  in  the legislation that is being adopted  here today.  Bingo.  In comes an amendment nobody knows what it is; no hearings for a special little group, not just the  nonprofits,  the profits as well,  and  that is portrayed as fairness.  So what I seek from the manager of  the bill, the distinguished chairman of  our committee, is a commitment or a  promise-his word is good with me that we will have some hearings. Obvi ously, we cannot do them in the imme diate future-we are tied up with this  tax  reform-but  thereafter  dealing  with this whole subject so we can do  something constructive for a lot of el derly, not just that little group that is  in these homes, these continuing-care  facilities,  but  for  the  others  that  cannot afford to live in these facilities.  ",1985
748,30,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Obviously,  the  committee is interested in the plight  of  elderly health  care  and  elderly  housing. We are involved in this every  day. We have hearings on it almost  every session in one form or another.  We have undertaken action in the  past.  I  recall  in the last decade, al though I may be off a year or two, we  passed a provision to allow you to sell  your house and get $125,000, I believe  it was, $125,000 tax free so you could  roll it over in some other kind of re tirement facility. Clearly, when we set  up 401(k) pension plans, or approved  them which are being widely used,  much to the concern of the Treasury,  because the projected revenue losses  on them are maybe extraordinary, it  was deemed for the principal purpose  of  retirement. So  the committee  is  always open to consider other forms of  retirement security, additional forms  of security for those on retirement.  I do think the particular amendment  the committee adopted that Senator  HEINZ offered was a particular form of  life-care  retirement. There may be  others to be considered. I do not think  it unfair that we said on this particu lar occasion we will limit it to life care  even any more than it would be unfair  to say when we passed the rollover of  selling your house when you are 55 or  older that it is unfair. Yes, the com mittee will  try  to consider  it. You  know  the schedule. We are between  now and the end of September run ning about 3 days  a week on  tax  reform  hearings. The  distinguished  Senator from Rhode Island is chair man of the Tax Subcommittee. He has  hearings  scheduled  as  I  recall. We  have had Health Subcommittee hear ings. Trade is at issue. That is looming  ever larger. We will try to fit them in.  There may be some  full committee  hearings. We may not have enough  full committee days to have them, but  I think it is perhaps a little bit unfair  for the Senator from Rhode Island to  say we have not given consideration to  it in the past or simply because every  single  thing we pass does not affect  every single person equally it is unfair.  ",1985
749,30,13,Mr. CHAFEE., I do not think any body can suggest  from our remarks  that we have not dealt with the elder ly in the past. I am saying that this is  a new type of situation we are consid ering. Certainly the amendment that  we adopted in the committee 8 to 7  embarks us in an area that we have  not been before.  ,1985
750,30,13,Mr. PACKWOOD., You  recall  the  Senator-it does to a degree-was one  of  the  initial  supporters  of  those  401<k) plans. Some people get them.  Some people do not. I do not think  you regard it as unfair that some get  them and some do not.  ,1985
751,30,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," The 401<k)'s, as the  chairman knows, are not discriminato ry. There is no similar antidiscrimina tion rules for continuing care facilities.  ",1985
752,30,13,Mr. PACKWOOD.," I would be willing  to agree with the chairman of the sub committee  in  the case of employer  benefits. Any of these employee bene fits that are not discriminatory would  not be regarded as unfair, and the fact  that one employer provides them and  another does not  should not be  a  reason to distinguish between them.  ",1985
753,30,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," The manager of the  bill is misunderstanding the approach  I am seeking. I am not seeking to reex amine benefits that currently exist for  the elderly. What I am seeking is to  have some hearings in the future on  imaginative ways that we might care  for this very substantial group of our  population which is increasing and not  restrict it to this tiny little segment  that was taken care of when the other  great segment was  left out in  these  benefits. I am not out to reexamine  what was done in the past, or whether  $125,000 on the sale of a home is good  or bad or indifferent or should be in creased. The chairman misunderstood  me. I am not critical of anything that  has taken place in the committee in  the past. Realizing we are chock-full  through October I suspect with this  tax  reform,  I  am seeking  from  the  chairman of the committee some com mitment or  suggestion-however we  want to label it-that when we get a  breathing  spell we  can have  some  hearings, and get some people in to  think of  imaginative ways we  can  handle housing for the elderly other  than the existing methods.

761,43,13,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, the Sena tor from Kansas hopes the Senate will  quickly adopt  the Finance Commit tee's legislation responding to the im puted interest problem. It is a fair so lution which will allow sellers of real  estate to finance up to $2 million of  the sales price at 9 percent. This is  substantially below the interest rates  available commercially and  is essen tially pre-1984 law for these transac tions. This should take care of all resi dences and a large portion of commer cial transactions. It should be empha sized that we are not talking about the  purchase price of a building, but only  the size of the loan the seller is willing  to give. The sale price is not limited by  these rules.  For loans over $4 million, the rate  which must be stated is 100 percent of  the applicable Federal  rate. This  is  more favorable than either the Deficit  Reduction Act or the 6-month tempo rary rules which we enacted last fall. I  think most people will agree that it is  a rare buyer of real estate, no matter  how solvent, who could borrow at the  same interest rate as the Federal Government. Thus, the rate for even the  largest  transactions will  be  below  market.  For  transactions with between $2  and $4 million of seller-financing, a  blended rate between 9 percent and  the applicable Federal rate will apply.  In addition, the Finance Committee  added a provision to allow even lower  rate loans for larger transactions when  interest rates exceed 12 percent. This  should help real estate sales even if in terest rates should rise well above cur rent projections.  The committee bill meets  the  re quirement of revenue neutrality by ex tending the cost recovery period for  real estate generally  from 18  to 19  years. It is a measure of the commit tee's sense of responsibility that it has  sought to make desired changes with out adding to the Federal deficit.  I would say that it is disappointing  that the committee adopted an unre lated change  in the no-interest loan  rules to exempt refundable deposits to  a limited group of continuing care fa cilities from the laws applicable to ev eryone else. While this exception has  been portrayed as a proelderly issue, it  seems  to me  that  the  impact may  likely be to provide no cost financing  for these facilities and increasing their  profitability at  the expense of  the  Treasury.  Mr. President, despite this provision,  the bill is a satisfactory solution to the  imputed interest issue. The stop-gap  legislation will expire July 1. It would  be helpful to let buyers and sellers of  real estate know the Senate's position  before then.  ",1985
762,43,13,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, it is  very important that the Congress act  to legislate some reasonable rules re garding seller financing. If we don't  pass  some modifying  language  the  very punitive provisions of the Deficit  Reduction Act will go into effect July  1, 1985.  I don't think this would be  good for the economy and at the same  time I think it is unnecessary Govern ment intrusion into contractual rela tionships of buyers and sellers. I also  think  it undermines  the respect for  the tax system.  If Congress does nothing today, the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  provisions  become law. They force parties dealing  at arms-length  to negotiate  interest  rates that are equal to, or higher than,  commercial rates or else face adverse  tax consequences.  One of those tax consequences is to  perhaps end up paying income taxes  on what  I  call  phantom  interest  income.  If a person doesn't charge  enough interest, the IRS can impute  income  to him and make him pay  taxes on it even though there is no  income in his pocket. That is phantom  income and that is not right.  Seller-financing has become an  in creasingly popular alternative to com mercial financing.  In order  to make  the sale, sellers are often willing to ne gotiate  interest rates that are  lower  than  those  charged by  commercial  lenders. Realtors in my State tell me  that many  sales of property would  never occur without this ability to ne gotiate lower interest rates.  I am as concerned as anyone that  there may have been some abuses of  this provision. Proponents of stringent  imputed interest rules talk about tax  loopholes and tax free, tax sheltered  millionaires out there in business, the  implication being that seller financing  of real estate has somehow created a  whole  new  class  of millionaire  in  America.  I think the statistics confirm that to  the extent there has been abuse, it has  been on the really big deals.  I have  never heard it alleged that the family  selling their house because they have  outgrown  it, or are moving because  dad needs to find a new job someplace  else, are offering seller-financing be cause they think they are going to get  rich by abusing the tax code. It is just  not the case. The same is true for a  farmer or rancher selling some of his  land. Sometimes people have to offer  seller financing or the alternative  is  ""no sale."" This same reality faces the  small businessman.  As chairman of the Budget Commit tee I am painfully aware of all  the  steps we take to try and keep interest  rates down, yet in the context of this  issue,  if we don't adopt  the Duren berger approach or the House bill, we  will be not only encouraging higher in terest rates for these transactions, we  will be requiring them.  I am going to vote for the Duren berger  amendment.  It  corrects  the  overzealous nature of last year's seller  financing provisions and mitigates the  impact which would have resulted.  For sales under $2 million the safe harbor rate would be 9 percent.  For sales between $2 and $4 million,  the first $2 million would be at 9 per cent and the rest would be at the ap plicable Federal rate. This results in a  blended rate.  For sales over $4 million, the entire  sale must be financed at the applicable  Federal rate. This is the so-called cliff  provision.  I don't like the cliff. For a rapidly  growing State like New Mexico, this $4  million ceiling is not good, however, it  is better than the House version and it  is better than the provisions  in the  Deficit Reduction Act. Treasury offi cials tell me it is the best we can do  without losing a  tremendous amount  of tax revenue.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1985

764,56,13,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  arms control is a burning issue in Con gress and throughout the country. It  should be. If history teaches us any thing  about  the  causes of war,  it  teaches us that when two leading and  hostile military powers  in the world  compete in building massive arsenals  of destruction they move on a deadly  dangerous track to war. Neither adver sary may intend to go to war. Indeed  the great irony of this age is that both  nuclear powers are building their arse nals in the name of peace. Peace they  say means  strength and no matter  how many times each nation can blow  up the other somehow it does not feel  strong enough.  His Holiness Pope John Paul spoke  in Belgium on May 17. He spoke  in  memory of those who died in World  War I. He called for an end to war. He  pleaded and prayed for an end to the  arms race. The Pope also said that we  must be realistic and recognize  that  war can be forced on a nation by ag gression. In that case the nation that  is attacked has,  in  the view of  the  Pope, a duty as well as a  right  to  defend itself.  Now, Mr. President,  it  is perfectly  obvious that if the United States at tacked the Soviet Union or the Soviet  Union attacked the United States both  nations would perish. And I mean ut terly perish. You know what. I know  it. President Reagan knows it and Mr.  Gorbachev and his fellow Communist  leaders in the Kremlin know it. If only  1,000 of the 13,000 nuclear warheads  that the United States can deliver on  the U.S.S.R. get there, and far more  would,  in  a  superpower war,  there  would be no organized Soviet Union  left. More than half their population more  than  130 million Russians would  die  almost  instantly.  The  United States would suffer a similar  total catastrophe. So why not stop the  arms race now? If we could stop the  arms race right here and now,  if we  could freeze it, the prospect of a nucle ar war would sharply diminish.  Will this administration consider ne gotiating to stop the arms race now or  ever? No. The chances are absolutely  nil. Maybe 4 years from now in the  new administration there will be hope.  There will be hope, that is, if a nuclear  catastrophe does not  strike  in  the  meantime. So what can we do?  In the meantime,  there is another  kind of arms race we can and should  stop right now. It is the race to sell  arms or give arms to the Third World,  the  undercieveloped  countries. Mr.  President, can you or can any Senator  imagine a crueler or more truly waste ful policy than selling or lending or  giving lethal weapons of war to impov erished countries? I cannot.  On May 16 the Senate passed a for eign aid bill. What kind of foreign aid  did that bill provide? Sad to say bil lions of dollars of that foreign aid con sisted of lethal military weapons. Only  17 of us voted against that expendi ture of billions of dollars of the Ameri can taxpayers money that will go  to  burden those depressed, impoverished  countries with military weapons. As  always, the military aid was justified  as a means of preventing aggression. A  strong case can be made that this is  precisely and exclusively the purpose  of this assistance. On the other hand,  the U.S.S.R. is providing its own for eign military aid program. And what  countries receive lethal military weap ons from the U.S.S.R.? The very na tions  that oppose  the nations  the  United States arms. Both sides are  spending  their  treasure  to  enable  these poor countries to destroy each  other.  It  is  outrageous. And  the  amounts are  immense. Considerable  evidence  indicates  that  the  foreign  military assistance and sales and loans  from the Soviet Union exceeded U.S.  military assistance plus sales and loans  in 1984 by a margin of $10.4 billion to  $7.2 billion. Incidentally France sold a  whopping $9.2 billion. Since France is  generally aligned against  the Soviet  Union and with NATO, it seems likely  that the anti-Communist Third World  nations may have ended up with more  military weapons from  the big three  military exporters than the Commu nist Third Worlders did.  Now, Mr. President, how cruel and  inhumane  this  traffic  in military  weapons is. Doesn't this vicious arms  competition call out for arms control?  This country should press and press  hard  for  an  agreement with  the  U.S.S.R. and with France and other  arms exporting countries to stop it.  Americans line up all over the coun try to contribute to help those starv ing in Africa and Asia. That instinct to  help suffering people is beautiful and  noble. We should help. But the great est help we could give  the  impover ished people of the Third World would  be to negotiate an international reduc tion in the sale, the loan, the gift of  military weapons  to  Third World  countries. These weapons  impoverish  as well as kill and maim human beings.  We cannot unilaterally stop this terri ble  traffic  in death without giving  Communist countries an  advantage.  But we can and should negotiate an  end to this burden on American tax payers that brings only death, misery,  and poverty to the Third World.  POLL RESULTS SHOW U.S. DRUG  USE TOPS 1960's LEVEL  ",1985
765,56,13,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, a  very disturbing report was featured in  the Washington Post's Health maga zine. The title says it all: ""Drug Use  Tops 1960's Level.""  In this article, the results of a recent  Washington Post-ABC News nation wide survey reveal that young Ameri cans are experimenting with drugs far  more than their 1960's counterparts.  In the survey, half the individuals be tween the ages of 18 and 30 said they  have tried marijuana and one in five  said they have used cocaine. By con trast, among  those aged 31  to 44people who came of age when drug use  first  became widespread-only  one third said they had ever used marijua na, and only 1 in 12 reported having  tried cocaine.  An additional, and even more trou bling,  statistic of  this poll,  is  that  while drugs started as a big-city prob lem  a  generation  ago,  the  survey  shows that marijuana and cocaine use  have spread, expanding  to  the sub urbs, small towns, and rural communi ties. Though drug use is still greatest  in urban areas, and along the east and  west coasts, it has risen sharply every where else  in  the United States as  well.  Among  those aged 18  to 30, 4  in  every 10, whether they use the drug or  not, felt that there should be no pen",1985
766,108,13,Mr.  BAUCUS.,"  Mr.  President,  today's papers carry reports of a Japa nese announcement that tariffs will be  cut on 1,800 products in the next year.  According to reports, tariffs will be en tirely eliminated on 36 industrial items  and 4 agricultural items; tariffs will be  cut about 20 percent on the remaining  products.  We should welcome this action. Any  steps to open Japan's market are wel come.  At  the same  time, we must  look  closely at what is really being done.  I note that a great many products of  interest to me and my colleagues are  not  included: plywood,  for example,  and grapefruit, and chocolate.  I also note that this package does  not go as far as the original cabinet  proposal. According to reports in Mon day's press, Prime Minister Nakasone's  cabinet originally proposed across-the board tariff cuts on 2,400 products-in cluding plywood and grapefruit. I am  disappointed that the final announce ment is a retreat from this proposal.  Before we  can  judge  the  impact  these steps will have, we will have to  see the details. We will have to see ex actly how the Japanese Government  specifies the products that will be cov ered and how large the tariff reduc tions are.  Further,  it will  be  important  to  watch  implementation. Tariff  reduc tions  are  of  only  limited  help  if  changes  in  bureaucratic  procedures  are used to hinder imports.  I do not want to be overly negative.  If this announcement is a beginning  step, it is a welcome one. If it is fol lowed by an aggressive market opening  program, it will make a difference.  I eagerly await announcement of the  program on nontariff barriers next  month.  SUMMARY  Mr. President, the United States and  Japan are close allies. My State of  Montana and  the country of Japan  have a special bond. Tensions between  friends  are  always  distressing-and  often accompanied by feelings of great  frustration.  I am greatly concerned about the  United  States-Japan  relationship.  That is why I push so hard for a co herent U.S. trade policy and for Japan  to open its markets.  Japan  is  no  longer  the defeated  island nation in need of special treat ment. It is a major economic power one of the top five in the free world. It  must  take on  the responsibilities of  that position. When that happens the  relationship will be less stressful.e  1981  FARM POLICY  e ",1985
767,108,13,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, passing a long-term farm bill to  replace the expiring provis!ons of the  act before  the underlying 50year-old statutes take effect will make  the recent debate on aid to the Con tras look like a high school civics class  discussion. The fact of the matter is  that this year's debate on farm policy  will force Congress to make some very  difficult choices on the future of agri culture. Unfortunately for rural Amer ica, Congress' difficult  choices will  have painful  financial  ramifications  for our family farmers.  For  instance, conventional wisdom  holds  that  this  country  needs  a  market-oriented  farm  policy  if we  want to be competitive  in the inter national marketplace. A market-ori ented farm policy fits in nicely with  current  efforts  to  reduce  Federal  spending. But how  can  the  farmers who are technically insolvent,  the 109,000 farmers who are on the  verge of  insolvency and  other farmers who need some form of  debt restructuring, pay off their debts  with the lower loan rates and target  prices called for under every market oriented proposal? They cannot, and  that is why the Farm Credit Council  has come  to  the conclusion  that  it  needs authority to establish a federal ly chartered entity to purchase $10 bil lion in distressed fa:r.m assets.  So, Mr. President, it comes as no sur prise to this Senator that the House  and Senate Agriculture Committees  are having a hard time rewriting the  1981 farm bill. It is not easy fitting a  farm program into the numbers con tained  in  the Senate passed budget  resolution. It is not easy putting to gether a farm program which will take  America's farmers into the 21st centu ry. It is not easy designing a farm pro gram that will enable family farmers  to survive through next spring.  But we must, and for those Members  who have not had an opportunity to  the 417,000  98,000  ",1985

",1985
776,121,13,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker, I was  listening  to our Budget Committee  chairman, Mr. GRAY, a short time ago,  who said that ""everything was on the  table in the budget."" So I hope that  we do break that impasse and get back  to balancing the budget.  Mr. Speaker,  today I will continue  the  series  of  !-minute  speeches  I  began yesterday presenting some of  my  constituents' comments on  the  budget-speeches  that  I  hope will  remind Members arfd especially  the  budget conferees of the charge given  by the American people, whom we rep resent. And that charge  is: Get the  Federal Government's financial house  in order.  Stephen J. Rogers, of Ann Arbor,  MI, writes: ""Our Government cannot  continue to borrow 23 cents for every  dollar  it spends. Every part of  the  Government must fully participate in  spending  reductions-including  the  Pentagon.""  In her  letter, Marjorie  Shannon, of Ann Arbor, says: ""I am a  widow and do not have a pension but I  approve  of  cutting my  benefits  if  things are cut fairly."" And Ann Arbor  residents  Michael  and  Katherine  O'Rear write: ""We believe all aspects  of Government programs must share  in required cutbacks, and all citizens  must expect to share the sacrifice. We  will support your efforts so  long as  fairness is maintained     .""  I'd like  to  thank my constituents.  Members and especially budget confer ees,  listen  to what  they're saying.  Their watchword  is  fairness. Their  charge: Reduce the deficit. Thank you.  PUBLIC OFFERING IN THE SALE  OF CONRAIL  <Mr. EDGAR asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
777,121,13,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, today I  join  with  my  colleague,  DENNIS  ECKART of Ohio, in introducing legisla tion to provide for a public offering in  the sale of Conrail.  A year ago, I called upon the Secre tary of Transportation not to move on  a quick ""fire sale"" of Conrail to Nor folk Southern or any other private  bidder. Now we have on the table sev eral options, and I urge my colleagues  to  look at  the opportunity  that we  have to use a public offering to pre serve Conrail as an independent rail road for the Northeast and Midwest  regions of the country, a railroad that  is as profitable as the existing Conrail,  while still returning it to the private  sector.  In January of this year, I introduced  legislation  to provide for  this public  offering, but the legislation that we in troduced today is better. It consists of  the offering that was put together by  a number of investment groups and  announced last month.  Hopefully this legislation will be se riously considered by our Committee  on Energy and Commerce and brought  to the House floor as quickly as possi ble.  I believe that for jobs and for eco nomic development  in my State of  Pennsylvania  as well  as  the entire  older industrial region of the North east and Midwest, we need a viable  railroad, and I believe that the public  offering is our best option.  While I agree with the concept of a  public  offering  and  support  the  Morgan Stanley proposal as outlined  in the Eckart bill, some of the bill's  provisions need  to be expanded and  clarified. For example, I will work to  ensure that the primary repair facility  ",1985

If this  amendment goes in the bill, I say to  the Members, it is for real because it is  in the Senate bill. Senator GRASSLEY  got it in the bill. So it does not come  out in conference. They do not play  games with it. They do not change the  intent of  the House. This  is  real  reform in terms of production costs.  ",1985

781,134,13,Mr. MILLER of California., I yield to  the gentleman from Washington.  ,1985

783,134,13,Mr. MILLER of California.," After  compiling  the  information,  they  adopted  it unanimously, and that is  why the committee does not like this  amendment, because they will not get  to support us on the floor and then  work against us in conference. So this  is real reform. Some things we did last  night may or may not survive the con ference. This one will.  ",1985
784,134,13,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman,  I  think  that  the  Committee on Armed Services is being  described as assuming or taking a cer tain posture, which really we are re luctant to do, and I would like to make  a couple of points here.  I think that what the gentlewoman  from California is attempting to do is  commendable. I think that most of the  members of our committee would cer tainly support what she is attempting  to achieve. It is just that we have very  real reservations as to whether or not  what the language in the amendment  says would in fact achieve the purpose  that we would all like to see.  In talking with the Department of  Defense-not necessarily the contrac tors-they tell us that it is not work able for a number of reasons. One is  that the production quantities quite  often are small. We have a unique  need for a widget or whatever  that  goes on the aircraft or on a ship, or  whatever, and so you cannot go  into  the commercial run, as would normal ly be the case when somebody is going  into a commercial enterprise and when  one wants to compete and they say,  ""Hey, there's a need for this. We are  going to get into the business and we  are going to make a run and make so  many of these because we  feel  that  the market out there would absorb so  many of these items.""  0 1230  So  it  really  is not comparable  in  many, many  instances,  to what  the  needs and  the requirements of con tracting for  the Department of De fense to the commercial sector of the  country.  Second, many of the items that are  required by  the Department of De fense are very technically sophisticat ed and are not duplicated in the com mercial world. For that reason, you  cannot get a comparison.  Third, and I really would like to em phasize this, I would like all the Mem bers to be aware of this, there is not  one major weapons  system  that  is  being acquired for the Department of  Defense today that is manufactured at  the most economical  rate, not one.  You cannot name one, a ship or anti submarine warfare equipment or air craft, and the main reason is the Con gress.  We determine the rate of production  and we squeeze back and we stretch  out the production rate; so even if you  have information that the gentlewom an would require, it is really sort of  meaningless, because if you go to in dustry and say, ""Hey, what is the best  production rate, what would you nor mally expect this to cost per item?""  They say, ""Well, on a run of so and  so, it will cost this.""  Well, when  you  are  buying M-1  tanks or F-16 aircraft or whatever, F15's, for instance, we are spending, the  best estimate is, over $1 million perF15 aircraft over what we would have to  spend if we produced it at the most ec onomical rate.  Why do we not produce it at the  most  economical  rate? Because  the  Congress says  that we do not have  that much money, we will only fund it  up  to  this amount and they stretch  out the production rate and you get  them later and pay more for  them.  That is our problem. That is not the  contractor's fault, but we do that. We  do  that every year on most  every  major weapons system, the M-1 tank,  the F-16, the F-18, you name it. The  ",1985
785,147,13,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentle man from Virginia [Mr. PARRIS].  ",1985
786,147,13,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Chairman, in Sep tember 1976, the Congress refused to  extend the Renegotiation Board's au thority  to  act. The Renegotiation  Board's funding was  terminated and  the Board disbanded in March 1979.  One of the principal reasons for Con gress'  termination of  the Renegoti ation Board's activities was that it was  spending more money than it was re covering.  In July 1981, Congress  re pealed  the Vinson-Trammel Act  in  favor of a wartime profit control.  In 1976,  the Renegotiation Board  made excessive profits determination  of $40 million before allowance  for  Federal taxes, or roughly $20 million  after taxes. Approximately 85 percent  of the dollars determined to be exces sive profits were challenged in court.  In that year,  the courts resolved 29  cases in favor of contractors, reducing  the Government's  recoveries  by 65  percent.  In  June  1981,  the House Armed  Services Subcommittee on Procure ment and Military Nuclear Systems  determined that there was no peace time need  for  renegotiation. There fore, the law was amended to provide  the President authority to control con tractor profits during wartime or in a  declared period of national emergency.  That authority is effective today.  A newly established Renegotiation  Board would have to hire a large staff  in order to perform its mission. The  mission,  cited  in  the  amendment,  would be to renegotiate Federal con tracts and subcontracts ""*    by divi sion and by major product line within  a division of the contractor or subcon tractor."" The Board could not rely on  the Defense Contract Audit Agency or  other elements of the Department of  Defense or other executive agencies  for assistance  in accomplishing  this  effort. As shown in testimony on May  15,  1985  in a  joint hearing of  the  House Armed Services Committee's  Seapower and Investigations Subcom mittees,  the personnel  resources of  DCAA are limited and do not enable it  to audit all  the completed contracts  for which it is already responsible.  The costs  incurred by the Depart ment of  Justice and other Federal  agencies  in  pursuing  renegotiation  cases would also be very high. History  demonstrates  that approximately 85  percent of the profits found to be ex cessive will result in legal actions.  Renegotiation will cause industry to  incur large additional costs of record keeping and  reporting. The amend ment requires renegotiation by prod uct line and by company division. It is  not  clear whether  any  contractors  record or report profits by product-as  the amendment apparently requires or would be required to establish addi tional records solely to meet this re quirement.

788,147,13,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, among the provisions  included  in  the measure before us  today is the contracting for education al services for members of the Armed  Forces, civilian employees of DOD, or  the dependents of such members or  employees. Among  the recommenda tions of  the Committee on Armed  Services is a direction to the General  Accounting Office [GAOl to study the  overseas educational needs of our mili tary,  the structure  required  to ade quately ensure quality cost-effective ness  in meeting  those needs. This  GAO study would not be due until  1986. Meanwhile, the language of the  measure  in section 801(b),  effective  upon enactment, calls upon the Secre tary of the concerned service to bal ance  twin administrative responsibil ities of avoiding unnecessary duplica tion of courses with the feasibility of  access of more than one provider of  education.  Mr. Chairman, my  questions  are  these: Would the distinguished chair man of the Armed Services Committee  agree with me that in order to provide  the highest quality of education serv ices,  the Secretary of the concerned  service may  take  into account such  factors as the following: the quality of  instructional personnel of the institu tional providers; the choice of offer ings available to the service members;  the  instructional  programs  offered;  the  experience,  stability,  and  track  record  in  offering  similar  services  under similar conditions; cost to the  service member of the particular offer ings; and plans for accepting on trans fer course credits between cooperating  institutions?

804,160,13,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Chairman, I ap preciate the gentleman yielding.  I was  fascinated by the discussion  early on of  those supporters of  the  Brown-Coughlin  amendment  who  seem to dismiss the importance of low level satellites, arguing that if the So viets did not have  the capability  to  take  satellites  out  at  our  highest  ranges, which give us the early warn ing capability, or perhaps even at mod erate ranges, we need not worry be cause all they can affect are low-level  orbiting satellites.  I was concerned that somehow the  impression  is  left  that anything we  have that orbits at a low level should  not be something we should be con cerned about. If they have the capabil ity and we do not, we do not need to  worry about it, because what they take  out is nothing more than a weather  forecast on channel 4  tonight at 11  o'clock.  I would, for a second, like to enter  into  a  brief colloquy with my col league,  the gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. NELSON], who  is very well  in formed on  this  issue, and wish  the  gentleman would comment.  May I ask the gentleman from Flori da [Mr. NELSON]  if he has any com ment in terms of the importance of  low-level satellites.

I can share with the gentleman that  just having come from Germany visit ing with  the U.S. Army  there and  trying to appreciate something, for ex ample, of the problems facing a NATO  commander in the European theater; a  NATO commander needs to have all of  the Asat's at his command in order to  make informed and proper judgments  about a potential battle, not the least  of those would be  information from  our weather satellites which are sub ject to being struck by the existing  operational system of the Asat of the  Soviets, or our surveillance Asat's in cluding optical sensors.

808,160,13,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to go on, and I appreciate  the  contribution  of  the  gentleman  from Florida. He is an expert in this  area. It is something that is very im portant.  Information  on  navigation  and weather, for example, is extreme ly important in order to make very im portant  and  crucial  decisions  that  affect the command and deployment.  These are a list of U.S. space Asat's  that are vulnerable to what has been  characterized  as  a  nonthreatening  Soviet Asat, even  though we do not  have any Asat at all.  There  is photographic  intelligence,  reconnaissance; we  use photographs  obviously  to  determine  compliance  with the treaties that are so  impor tant.  I am sure people would not argue  that  treaty compliance and verifica tion  is  something  trivial  to be dis missed as an unimportant asset. They  are threatened by the Soviet coorbital  Asat system.  It has been mentioned that our low level weather satellites are threatened.  Our  ocean  electronic  intelligence  gathering capability satellite is threat ened by the Soviet Union Asat system,  which  is operable, which has been  tested against an object in space and  ours has not.  Low-orbit navigation satellites that  we utilize constantly are  threatened  by the Soviet Asat system.  And  something  that  is  constantly  launched  from  the gentleman's dis trict in Florida, our manned vehicles,  they all fly at low levels. They at the  present time are in jeopardy by Soviet  Asat capabilities, because they fly in  low orbits.  I would like to have someone on the  other side to say that our manned ve hicles in space are not crucial, are not  important and are not threatened by  the Soviet Asat.  The gentleman from Ohio has the  time.  ",1985
809,160,13,Mr.  BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, would the gentleman like  to yield to me to respond to that?  ",1985
810,160,13,Mr. KASICH.," I am glad to yield to  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  California.  ",1985
811,160,13,Mr.  BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, the situation with regard to  low-level satellites is as follows: The  low-level orbiting navigational  satel lites are already being replaced by the  new NAVCAR system and that is not  approachable by the Soviet system.  The shuttle has maneuvering capa bility and it cannot be threatened be cause it has the ability to maneuver  out of  the way of any approaching  hazardous object of any kind.  ",1985
812,173,13,Mr. FAZIO.,"  For too long, we've wasted dollars we  don't have building strategic nuclear  weapons we don't need and are better  off without. Most conspicuous among  these  is  the vulnerable sitting duck  MX target missile.  As a result of this inexcusable waste,  we've had  troops  in Europe with  equipment of terrific quality, but con siderably less quantity than would be  desirable. This means there is greater  danger that we'd have to go nuclear to  repel  a Soviet  invasion of Western  Europe.  The Bennett-Fazio-Downey amend ment is an attempt to improve this sit uation. We take a billion dollars we've  saved on MX, and we put it into a bil lion  dollars' worth of  conventional  missiles,  ammunition, and so  forth.  This makes military sense,  it makes  national security sense, and I hope ev eryone will support it.e  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  question is on the amendment offered  by the gentleman from Florida [Mr.  BENNETT].  The amendment was agreed to.  0 1740  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. SAVAGE  ",1985
813,173,13,Mr. SAVAGE.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. SAVAGE: Insert  the following new section at the end of the  Title X, (page 200, after line 4):  SEC. 1050. CONTRAcriNG REQUIREMENTS.  <a> Except where compelling national se curity considerations require otherwise, not  less than 10 percent of the amounts appro priated pursuant to authorizations made by  titles I, II, and IX shall be expended for  contracts entered into with small business  concerns owned and controlled by socially  and economically disadvantaged individuals  <as defined by section 8 of the Small Busi ness Act and regulations issued under such  section), historically Black colleges and uni versities, and minority institutions <as de fined by the Secretary of Education pursu ant  to  the General Education Provisions  Act>, provided, however, that whenever the  Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of  Energy proposes to waive the preceding re quirements, the Congress must first be noti fied  in writing  including  the  justification  therefor.  <b> The Secretary of Defense and the Sec retary of Energy shall submit semiannual  reports to the Congress on their compliance  with the requirements in subsection <a> with  a full explanation for any failure to comply  with the requirements and a plan to remedy  such failure. The first such reports shall be  submitted to  the Congress no  later than  May 1, 1986.  ",1985
814,173,13,Mr. SAVAGE.," Mr. Chairman, I have  persistently expressed and consistent ly voted my believe that our defense  spending is prioritized toward prepara tions for war, rather than the promotion of peace. Our foreign policy  is  based more upon might  than upon  right, oriented more  to domination,  rather than justice and prosperity in  the world. Yet since that major issue  has been decided  to the contrary,  I  raise now another wrong in the $224  billion  defense  authorization  bill  before us today, that is, our defense  spending has not been in the most ef ficient  and  economical manner  in  terms of maximizing the value of dol lars spent on creating jobs and build ing our domestic economy.  The  amendment  I  here  propose  simply addresses  the  latter  issue  to  help maximize and target the value of  every dollar we spend. In this time of  huge Federal deficits, when every de fense dollar is competing with a do mestic program dollar, economy is of  great importance and at a time when  black Americans suffer unemployment  hovering  around  20  percent,  three  times that of whites, and is steadily in creasing and when black-owned busi nesses  are  bankrupting  at  a  rate  higher than the overall rate of  the  awful Depression of the 1930's, some  targeting of Government procurement  is essential.  In addition, it is well known that re search funds provide substantial sup port for the top research universities  in this country. It draws the top-notch  staff, builds  the  institutional  infra structure, attracts the technicians and  allows  for  the procurement of  ad vanced research equipment; however,  of the $376 million spent in fiscal year  1984  for university research, faculty  development, facilities and equipment,  only $4 million, or just 1 percent went  to historically black colleges and uni versities, and let me emphasize that  this meager amount was  even  less  than  the amount such colleges  re ceived in fiscal year 1982; a reduction  to greater unfairness in blatant viola tion of President Reagan's own Execu tive Order 12-320 of September 15,  1981, which ordered ""the development  of  a  Federal program designed  to  achieve a significant increase in the  participation by historically black col leges  and  universities  in  federally  sponsored programs.""  And please take note of the fact that  89 of the 1,979 4-year colleges and uni versities  in  this country are black.  That is almost 5 percent of the total,  but receiving only 1 percent of  the  Federal RDT&E funds spent for de fense.  Also,  the Department of Defense  small business reports show that mi nority-owned businesses received only  2.2 percent of 1984 Defense procure ment dollars, less than $3 billion out  of approximately $125 billion obligat ed.  Moreover, these records reveal that  in 1984 less than 1 percent of RDT&E  money went  to minority businesses,  4. AIR FORCE  The amendment will provide a total  of $50 million for the Air Force to be  spent on communications equipment  and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles-this  would bolster the conventional staying  power of the Air Force.  5. THE MARINES  The Marines will have their conven tional capability bolstered by the pro curement  of  additional  pieces  and  shells. This will give the Marine Re serve units the same equipment as the  active duty Marine units thus improv ing training, cooperation, and mobili zation of the Reserves.  ",1985
815,173,13,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman, let  me just say that the gentleman from  California [Mr. FAZIO], as well as the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  DowNEY], has done a magnificent job,  and I appreciate it.  ",1985
816,173,13,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Chair man, will the gentleman yield further?  ",1985
817,173,13,Mr. BENNETT., I yield to the gentle man from Mississippi.  ,1985
818,173,13,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," Mr. Chair man,  I  think my question has been  partially answered. In looking at the  report,  it says:  Improved Guard and  Reserve Readiness. Advanced sched uled  purchases  of missiles will  be  transferred to the Reserve units, and  also houses for  the Marine Reserve  will be considered to be transferred to  the Reserve forces.  All I want to stress to the gentleman  in the well is again that the Reserves  have over 50 percent of the combat  missions now and they are getting less  than 10 percent of the equipment. I  certainly hope that part of this $1 bil lion will go over to the Reserve forces.  ",1985
819,173,13,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Chairman, I will  do my best to see that the Reserves  get their proper amount.  ",1985
820,173,13,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1985
821,173,13,Mr. BENNETT., I yield to the gentle man from Washington.  ,1985
822,173,13,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to commend the gentleman from Flor ida  [Mr.  BENNETT],  a  very  senior  member and a distinguished member  of this committee. I think he has made  a case that is very important, that if  we are going to raise the threshold in  Europe so as to avoid the use of nucle ar weapons, tactical and battlefield, we  have to do more to improve our con ventional  readiness and our conven tional capability.  For my friends who are concerned  about the use of strategic weapons, I  would argue that this amendment is a  very important indication and a very  important way to improve convention al capability.  So, Mr. Chairman,  I  strongly sup port the amendment, and I want to  commend my  friend,  the gentleman  from Florida, for offering it. I think it  ",1985
823,186,13,Mr. DANIEL., Then I have one other  question.  ,1985
824,186,13,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, would  the gentleman from Virginia yield to  me, please?  ",1985
825,186,13,Mr. DANIEL., Not at this point.  have one other question.  ,1985
826,186,13,Mr. SHAW.," I would like to attempt  to reply to the gentleman's question, if  I could ask the gentleman to yield to  me.  ",1985
827,186,13,Mr. DANIEL., I was asking ,1985
828,186,13,Mr. BEN NETT.,  ,1985
829,186,13,Mr. SHAW., I realize that.  Mr. BENNET!'. If you hand them to  me I will read them.  ,1985
830,186,13,Mr. DANIEL.," If the object of the  gentleman's amendment is deterrence,  and  that  is what we discussed  this  morning,  to  let  the drug smugglers  know that every time they see a naval  vessel  they are  in danger of arrest,  why would his purpose not be served  by having law enforcement boarding  parties aboard? Why not let the law  enforcement personnel be the ones to  go ashore for court and legal proceed ings so as not to disrupt fleet oper ations?  Mr. BENNET!'. I am glad you asked  me that question. I cannot speak on  that in a minute, but I will do my best  in 2 minutes.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Virginia  [Mr. DANIEL] has again expired.  <By unanimous consent Mr. DANIEL  was allowed to proceed for 2 additional  minutes.)  Mr. BENNET!'. The problem about  that,  the answer to that is  I would  much prefer having the civilian  law  enforcement people on the vessels. Of  course I would prefer it.  But there is no way in which we are  going to get them. It is just like we  went through the other day about this  reform. You know, it is very difficult  to get the things up here. There are a  thousand ways of killing  it. We are  seeing one way of killing a good bill  here  today, nit-picking  it  to death.  That is all there is to it. It has nothing  to do with the merits of it.  We are trying to use the great force  of the U.S. Government  to rid our selves of one of the worst battles and  confrontations in this country and we  are being nit-picked to death. And if  you kill  this measure it will be nit picking the bill, not because of the  merits.  The problem about this situation is  that the  law enforcement personnel  are  just not going to be made avail able. It would take billions of dollars  to produce the Coast Guard ships, it  would take millions of dollars to put  the people on the ships. And if you  put the people on the ships you are  going to have people that are going to  be like riding the Queen Mary, Queen  Elizabeth I or Queen Elizabeth II.  ",1985
831,186,13,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield to me?  ",1985
832,186,13,Mr. DANIEL.," Mr. Chairman, I agree  with the gentleman from Florida [Mr.  BENNETT], that there is no greater, no  more  serious  problem  facing  this  Nation today than drug addiction and  the drug smuggling which contributes  to it. But that is not what we are talk ing about tonight.  What we are talking about tonight is  whether or not uniformed personnel  shall have the right to arrest civilians,  and I am opposed to that.  I  thank the gentleman and I yield  back the balance of my time.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. ENGLISH AS A SUB STITUTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY  MR. BENNETT  ",1985
833,186,13,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Chairman,  I  offer an amendment as a substitute  for the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. ENGLISH as a  substitute for  the amendment offered by  Mr. BENNETT: Page 200, after line 4, insert  the following new section:  SEC. 1050. STUDY ON DRUG-INTERDICTION ASSIST ANCE TO CIVILIAN LAW  ENFORCE MENT PERSONNEL.  <a> STUDY.-The Secretary of Defense  shall conduct a study comparing(!) the potential effectiveness of assigning  members of the armed forces under the Sec retary's jurisdiction, with  <2>  the potential effectiveness of increas ing the number of tactical law enforcement  teams on naval vessels,  for  the purpose of determining ways  to  assist civilian law enforcement personnel in  the interdiction of the illegal importation of  narcotics into the United States. The Secre tary shall submit the results of the study to  the Congress not more that sixty days after  the date of the enactment of this Act.  (b) CONSULTATION.-In  conducting  such  study, the Secretary shall consult with the  heads of agencies with  jurisdiction to en force  the Controlled Substances Act  (21  U.S.C. 801 et seq.) and the Controlled Sub stances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C.  951 et seq.).  Mr. ENGLISH (during the reading).  Mr. Chariman, I ask unanimous con sent that the amendment be consid ered  as  read  and  printed  in  the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN pro  tempore.  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?  There was no objection.  ",1985
834,186,13,Mr.  BENNETT.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  could I raise a point of order against  the amendment?  I would like to raise a point of order  against the amendment because if it is  what I think it is, it is not germane to  this bill. I have never seen it, it has  never been handed to me. I have never  read it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does  the gentleman reserve a point of order  at this time?  Mr. BENNET!'. Mr. Chairman, yes, I  reserve a point of order. I do not mind  the gentleman speaking about it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  gentleman  from Florida  [Mr. BEN NETT] reserves a point of order against  the amendment.  The gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr.  ENGLISH] is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",1985
835,186,13,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Chairman, no  Member of Congress has a more per sonal interest in the war against drug  smugglers  than does  the gentleman  from Florida. He has been relentless in  his commitment to this national emer gency, setting a determined example  that we could all follow. However in  this case, I feel that there is a better  way  to achieve  the  results  that he  seeks.  I am offering this amendment be cause I am concerned with the effect  of vesting civilian police powers in our  armed forces, allowing them to make arrests, searches, and seizures of civil ians in a law enforcement role.  The Government Operations  sub committee which I chair has held 20  hearings  on  the  drug  interdiction  problem, and we have enjoyed the con sistant support of the gentleman from  Florida, and shared some of his frus tration, as well. As a result of those  hearings, several points have become  quite clear, and the most important of  those points is that the military must  be more involved in drug interdiction  than in the past.  But, it is equally important to set  clear parameters for the Department  of Defense so that, while its assistance  is maximized, we maintain a tradition  in America-that law enforcement is a  civilian mission, not a mil.itary mission.  This concept was repeatedly stressed  by the drafters of the Posse Comitatus  Act amendment in 1981: the military is  to assist, but the primary responsibil ity for drug interdiction remains with  the Customs Service and  the Coast  Guard.  A glaring weakness in our interdic tion capability is our inability to col lect and process  timely  information  which can be used by the interdiction  agencies. This is  the area where the  military can be, and must be, more  helpful. Secretary Weinberger has re cently agreed to dramatic increases in  assistance.  Last Friday,  this body approved a  measure to create a special Air Force  wing with aircraft properly equipped  to detect smugglers. The peacetime  mission of this wing will be in direct  ",1985

838,212,13,Mr.  FISH.," Mr.  Chairman,  the  amendment I am offering today will  bring to a close a matter of longstand ing concern to the Department of De fense,  the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point, and many Members of  Congress by establishing a section 6  arrangement for the education of high  school students residing at West Point.  For many years, the high school stu dents who live on West Point property  have attended high school in the local  community of Highland Falls. This  has afforded these individuals the op portunity to mix with students of non military families and to get involved in  extracurricular  interscholastic activi ties which would not be available at a  school composed solely of students of  military families at West Point. The  relationship between the local commu nity and the Academy has been very  cooperative over the years.  In 1981,  following  the cutbacks  in  impact aid made in the Reconciliation  Act,  the Highland Falls-Fort Mont gomery Central School District faced  a severe funding shortfall, which par ticularly affected the high school. In  November 1982, the situation became  so  critical  that  the Highland Falls  Board of Education sent out tuition  notices  to parents of students from  West Point then attending the high  school. The Justice Department sued  to block this action, and tensions rose  between the local residents and West  Point. In December 1982, I raised for  the  first  time on  the  floor of  the  House the distinctive problem of the  Highland Falls School District and the  funding problems it faced then and for  the future without additional appro priations for impact aid in general or a  specific  appropriation  for Highland  Falls.  As part of the continuing resolution  for fiscal year 1983, Congress approved  $200,000 for Highland Falls, paid out  of Defense Department funds to the  Department of Education and in turn  to Highland Falls. At this time, I first  began discussing with both  the De partment of Education and  the De partment of Defense the establisment  of a section 6 arrangement between  the Department of Defense and the  Highland Falls School District, among  other options.  In May of 1983, I met with then-Sec retary of Education Terrell Bell and  Assistant Secretary Lawrence Daven port to discuss the long-term solution  to the funding problems at Highland  Falls.  Secretary Bell  recommended  that his staff work with the Congress  and the Department of Defense to de velop a plan to resolve  this matter.  That same month, I appeared before  the House Appropriations Subcommit tee on Labor, Health and Human Serv ices, and Education to thank the chair man, Mr. NATCHER, and the ranking  minority member, Mr. CoNTE, for their  assistance in obtaining the release of  the $200,000 to Highland Falls, which  had been unduly delayed by the De partment of Education. In my testimo ny, I also cited the fact that the De partment had not responded positively  to  the chairman's letter  requesting  that they formulate a long-term solu tion to the funding situation.  Several alternatives were proposed  to  the Department of Education  in  May of 1983, including transferring a  grade from the section 6 elementary  school at West Point  to  the high  school in Highland Falls, which would  enable the school to become a super A  school under section 3 of the impact  aid statute; weighing high school at tendance more heavily than elementa ry school attendance, since West Point  students  only  attended  the  high  school; or changing the formula for  funding  section 2 and  section 3  so  those schools who received under, for  example, $25,000 per year, would be  eliminated from the program. All were  rejected  over  a  period  of  several  months.  In November of 1983, despite addi tional funding for impact aid in fiscal  year  1984, Highland Falls  faced  a  shortfall, this time over $300,000. In  April 1984,  I  requested  this amount  from the Labor, HHS, Education Ap propriations Subcommittee, which in cluded the funding in the fiscal year  1984 supplemental appropriation. The  Appropriations Committee report  in cluded  language  indicating  that  the  Department of Defense and the De partment of Education should cooper ate in solving the funding problem at  Highland Falls on a  long-term basis.  At  that time  the report signaled  it  would be the last time a specific ap propriation would  be  approved.  In  March of 1984,  the Highland Falls Fort Montgomery Central School offi cially requested a section 6 arrange ment with the Department of Defense  for educating the high school students  residing at West Point.  As  the end of the school year ap proaches on June 30, Highland Falls is  faced with a funding shortfall. Their  budget has been flat for several years,  the number of teachers has been re duced by more than 25 percent, and  property taxes are among the highest  in  the country. This  is  in an area  where more than 95 percent of the  land is owned by the Federal Govern ment or has been set aside as State  parkland. Approximately one-third of  the local community is senior citizens  living  on  fixed  incomes.  Property  wealth is well below the State average,  as is income per taxpayer. Even with  the high tax rates, average operating  expenditures are well below the State  average.  For the past 3 years, Highland Falls  has applied to the Department of Edu cation for section 3(d)(2)(B) emergen cy funding. Despite the obvious need,  they have been  turned down  each  year, including fiscal year 1985. Stud ies  indicate that Highland Falls has  the highest combined section 2 and  section 3 impaction in the country.  There  is  currently  a  shortfall of  some $300,000 in the school district's  budget. I have not asked the Appro priations Committee  for  additional  funds,  because  the Department  of  Education has had 3 years to resolve  this situation on a long-term basis, and  has responded negatively to inquiries  on behalf of the school district.

As I understand from the Speaker,  we are not going to have 1 minute to morrow so that we will be getting to  the committee business  right away.  And then as soon as we go  into the  Committee of the Whole on the de fense bill, the first business in order is  the Foley amendment.  That will continue for as long as it  takes  with  amendments  thereto.  There is no time limit on the Foley  amendment.  At 2 o'clock, under the unanimous consent agreement, at 2 o'clock all  debate and all amendments to title X  will end. At that point the gentleman  from California [Mr. DELLUMS] under  the rule has 1 hour of debate on his  substitute amendment. We will  then  proceed for the 1 hour, or as much of  the hour as the gentleman from Cali fornia [Mr. DELLUMS] consumes.  At the close of that, we will consider  amendments printed in the RECORD to  title X which may not be offered but  which  are  in  the  REcORD.

Important voices  are being raised not just from the in dustrial Midwest, which has been dam aged by Japanese trade practices for  some time. They are now being heard  from the South, from the Southwest,  from the West, from all areas of the  Nation, because this is a national prob lem, it is a 50-State problem. I think  the comments of  the Senator from  Florida are very  important  to  this  debate, and I am happy to join with  him today.  ",1985

As we have seen  since the Senator from Michigan start ed raising these warnings, those num bers are just accelerating with a geo metric increase.  I certainly want to work with him  and all of the other Members of this  body who have now decided that we  are going to do something about it.  I hope  the Japanese will  listen to  our voice. I  think it would be much  better if they would recognize that fi nally we are through talking, finally  we are through waiting on studies or  additional information, finally, we are  not just concerned about their elector ate. We are concerned about jobs in  this country  that we see being  lost  every day.  ",1985
875,303,13,Mr. RIEGLE.," I  for his comments.  Before delivering my formal state ment on this issue, I want to call at tention  to a very  troubling develop ment in our trade crisis, and it is this:  The trade deficit, which is now run ning at an annual rate that exceeds  $150 billion is worsening by the day,  has now exhausted the net interna tional  investment position  that  the  United States has painstakingly built  up over the greater part of this centu ry. The United States has been a credi tor nation since 1914, but in the last  few weeks  that status has been re versed. We have now become a debtor  nation, and we are going into debt to  other nations at an accelerating rate.  According  to  the OECD Economic  Outlook  of  June  1985, within  12  months we will owe  the rest of the  thank the Senator  world a net amount in excess of $100  billion and within 24 months we will,  on net, owe an amount that is closer to  $250 billion.  Not only will we have gone  from  being a creditor to a debtor nation, we  will be the No. 1 debtor nation in the  world. We will have debts owing  to  other nations in excess of those that  are now outstanding by countries like  Mexico  and Brazil which  are  seen  internationally  as  financial  basket  cases at the present time.  So not only  is our  trade  income  statement bad, but also our trade ""bal ance  sheet""  is  deteriorating at  an  alarming rate. That can only harm our  long-term standing with  the rest of  the world.  Mr. President, for some time I have  wanted to make a major statement on  our trade problem, and I welcome the  opportunity to do so today.  ON JAPANESE TRADE BARRIERS  Mr. President, 5 months have passed  since Japanese Prime Minister Naka sone and President Reagan discussed  the  trade  tensions between our  two  countries,  and  still  the U.S.  trade  crisis, which has been intensifying for  years, continues to worsen and realis tic hopes for bilateral remedies seem  to be receding beyond reach.  Breaking events clearly show  that  the United States must itself take the  initiative  to quickly bring our trade  policies into line with the new realities  of international competition. For too  long our Government has relied on  vague hopes that Japan will respond  to talk, persuasion, and our good ex ample on trade matters.  That has not worked,  and  it  is  simply not enough. The United States  must make a real change in the inter national commercial and economic en vironments so  that competitive U.S.  products will have fair access to world  markets  and  Japanese  industries  cannot reap such huge profits from  unfair, exploitive trade strategies. We  have to do so before even more seri ous,  lasting damage  is done  to key  American industries.  Three recent news items underscore  this fact.  Last Friday, Japanese officials were  reported to be pessimistic about relief  of our  trade  imbalance. Mr. Saburo  Okita, long a leading figure in Japa nese industrial policies, was quoted as  saying that, ""if Americans and Euro peans expect quick results out of the  <Nakasone>  action program <on  the  trade imbalance), they will be disap pointed.""  On Tuesday, Acting U.S. Trade Rep resentative Michael Smith expressed  frustration with the ""glacial pace"" of  the trade talks that were initiated by  the Reagan-Nakasone meeting.  Then just yesterday, the announce ment of Japan's reduction of tariffs on  1,800 items included an admission by  Japanese officials that the action was  unlikely  to have a  large  impact on  Japan's trade surplus, which is expect ed to grow to $55 billion this year. As I  have had a chance to look at the tar iffs on that list, they are little more  than table scraps rather than any fun damental change in what is clearly a  severely imbalanced trading relation ship.  So, our trade dealings with Japan  make a very  frustrating  story  that  continues to grind on. That story has  proven dangerous to many important  industries in Michigan and across the  United States whose market strength  has been damaged and hundreds of  thousands of U.S. workers. We are  losing the best jobs we have had in  this country-jobs that really are at  the  core  of middle  class  economic  strength of this country.  Japan, as we know, has developed its  trade strategy over a very long period  of  time. It is essentially a  two-part  strategy made up first of aggressive  export expansion and second of reso lute resistence to imports other than  raw materials  into  its own domestic  market.  The strategy is deeply infused into  the procedures of the Japanese Gov ernment and the behavior of the Japa nese people. Many Japanese jobs have  been created by the surge in exports.  Their domestic policies have been de signed  to hold down  their own con sumer demand.  I am convinced that the Japanese  strategy also threatens the efficiency  and stability of the world trading and  financial systems. But the strategy has  brought the Japanese such huge prof its that they have strong incentives to  keep things they are as long as possi ble and to resist any movement in a  more equitable direction.  The general pattern has been for  Japan to build a high protective wall  around key industries as long as non Japanese firms are in a strong position  to compete in the Japanese market.  Explicit import barriers, such as tar iffs, are lowered or removed only after  they are no longer needed because in direct barriers have been erected or  because  Japanese  producers  have  gained an invincible market position.  Time and again, when Japan has an nounced steps to ""open their market""  to selected products,  there has been  very little expansion in those import  areas.  We saw the pattern clearly in auto motive  trade. Throughout  the early  1970's Japanese carmakers were able  to build a powerful base in the Japa nese market with the aid of barriers to  foreign  investment, high  tariffs and  commodity taxes which had the effect  of keeping out American cars and, for  that matter, cars from all other coun tries as well.  Many of those barriers have been re moved with some fanfare more recent",1985
876,316,13,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I want to  spend a few minutes talking about our  international trade situation, and then  I would like to ask unanimous consent  to insert in the RECORD the remarks of  the chairman of  the board of  the  Chrysler Corp., Lee Iacocca, who re cently spoke on the same issue. His re marks  dramatically  show  that our  trade situation  is  in crisis,  that we  must focus on that problem, and not  be distracted by less urgent concerns.  It was only a few months ago when a  number of us came before the Senate  and made pleas for firm action on our  trade problems similar to those we are  making now. They were  pleas  for  budgetary restraint as a way of reduc ing the deficit and improving the com petitiveness of the dollar. They were  pleas for tough negotiating with our  trading partners abroad. They were  pleas borne out of the crisis of the  present and recognizing the need to  take action now if we are to avoid a  greater crisis in the future.  And what have we done in the mean time? We have acquiesced in Japan's  removal of its voluntary restraints on  automobile  exports. Result:  imports  from Japan have surged by almost 25  percent. The Commerce Department  now predicts that by 1988, more than  one-third  of  the U.S.  automobile  market will be filled by foreign  im ports.  What  else  have we  done  in  the  meantime?  The  Senate  passed  a  budget resolution based on totally un realistic economic assumptions, and on  the unrealistic premise that deficit re duction could be accomplished by cut ting  spending  alone.  Result:  even  David Stockman is now admitting that  the deficit by 1988 will be larger than  was projected  in  the Senate-passed  budget resolution which he endorsed.  How much larger? Only about $70 bil lion-which means missing the mark  by about 70 percent. What it means is  that even  if  the President gets his  budget, the deficit in 1988 would be  little better  than  running  in place.  And we will continue to just run in  place if our fiscal policy continues to  be governed by the wisdom of a Clint  Eastwood movie. ""Make My Day"" may  be a great line for a movie, but it is a  copout when it comes to making the  hard choice of a revenue increase as  well as severe spending restraint if we  are to get the deficit under control.  Certainly it will require courage-but  it also will require the common sense  to realize that, for example, now is not  the time to reduce revenues by almost  $2 billion a year on cigarettes. But re grettably, the Senate recently refused  even to prevent that from happening.  So  the challenges before the Con gress and the administration are the  same now as  they were only a  few  months ago. We have to get tough on  trade negotiations, and we have to get  tough on the budget deficit which con tributes  to our declining  ability  to  compete  abroad  and  safeguard our  markets here at home. It is a question  of courage and a question of common  sense. We must not delay.  There being no objection, the speech  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  REMARKS OF LEE !ACOCCA  Thank you, John <Bailey, executive direc tor of F AF>. And good afternoon to all of  you.  I usually start by saying ""I'm happy to be  here."" But I always want to choke on that  line when here happens to be Washington.  Maybe you remember,  I  spent a  lot of  time in this town a few years ago trying to  get the government to co-sign a few small  bank notes for me. It wasn't the high point  of my life, believe me.  But I am happy to be with you. And I  want to thank you for inviting me.  I gotta tell you, though, this is going to be  tough. I know this is billed as an ""educa tional"" meeting, and that means I'm sup posed to stick to issues and not push Chrys ler. You should have asked me six years ago  when I didn't have much good to say about  Chrysler.  After all, back then Chrysler was getting  the Last Rites, but last year we  took $2.4  billion to the bank. And '85 will be a very  good year for us, too. I wish I could talk to  you about it.  I'd sure like to remind you that our stock  is up almost 15 percent since the first of the  year <while GM and Ford are back down>.  But I won't talk about that, either.  Usually with analysts I also talk about our  $10.5 billion product plan between now and  '89, and  the exciting new  lines we have  coming. But I won't get into that today.  I won't even mention our being number  one among the Fortune 500  in return on  assets at 26 percent . . . or that we're the  most profitable car company in the world  based on return on sales ... or that our ef ficiency last year gave us a pre-tax profit on  each car that was 50 percent higher than  GM or Ford. And I won't even tell you that  we've got thirty bucks in hard, cold cash for  every share of stock. No, I won't mention  any of that.  And the financial guys always want me to  say something about our commitment  to  buy back 25 million shares of our stock by  the end of '86. But I told them ""no, I can't  do that today.""  I'll be good-no commercials-I promise.  But things are going very well for Chrys ler <at long last), and, I have to say, for me,  too.  Last year I even became an author, and  the book has already sold 1.8 million copies.  <And another half-million overseas.) But I  have to confess that I really don't under stand why. It's got no sex, no violence, noth ing about the CIA. We did put a pretty girl  on  the  back  cover  to  hype  the  sales,  though-my mom.  My board is getting a little upset, by the  way. I've been selling more books than cars.  But I keep telling them it's because I don't  have any Japanese competition.  Well, I guess I should be happy about the  way things are going. I ought to be dancing  in the streets, in fact.  But I'll be honest with you-I'm not danc ing. I've been around too long to get eu phoric when things are going so well.  In  fact, I get a little suspicious.  Maybe  that's because of what we went  through at Chrysler. We woke up one day  and said ""hey, we can't compete anymore!""  And I'm scared that one day our country  will wake up with the same realization. And,  unlike Chrysler, it won't have any place t!>  tum for help.  We paid a hell of price for survival at  Chrysler. I didn't join a company, I got com mand of a  lifeboat . . . and it was getting  swamped. A lot of people went over the side.  I'm not talking about deadwood, either: I'm  talking about damn good people. People  with families to feed and kids to educate.  People who had done their best for Chrys ler, and who were on the street through no  fault of their own.  Those were the most miserable years of  my life and I'm never going to forget them.  And  I'm still mad  about  it,  because  it  shouldn't have happened.  I  told people when we were struggling  that the problem was a lot bigger than just  Chrysler. I said Chrysler was just a micro cosm of what was happening to all of indus trial America.  I turned out to be right. I went to the gov ernment for help, but I was just the first  one to get there <I don't know why God was  so good to me, but I got to be first!) After  me came the steel people, then the machine  tool people,  then some of the high  tech  boys, and earlier this year even the farmers  showed up. On the front page of The New  York Times this morning, even the comput er and high tech people are claiming they  need help.  ",1985
877,329,13,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President, I  will be brief. I would like to first con gratulate my colleagues who served as  the Senate conferees in the successful  effort to present to this body legisla tion that will renew and revitalize our  export control system. I can think of  no more  important legislative action  right now than approving export con trol procedures designed to facilitate  U.S. exports at all levels while at the  same time assuring that critical tech nology will not be made available to  our adversaries.  One of the more difficult adminis trative areas of our export control  system is the exportation of nonmili tary technology to friendly allied and  Western nations. During the Senate  Banking Committee's consideration of  the Export Administration Act  last  Congress I proposed, and the commit tee accepted, an amendment easing  export licensing requirements for cer tain nonmilitary exports  to friendly  Allied and Western Nations. It would  have given the U.S. Secretary of Com merce discretion in this area by allow ing some commercial goods to be ex ported under general export licenses  that formerly required prior approval  by the Government, while continuing  to require an  individual or multiple  validated  license  for  the export of  militarily critical goods and technolo gy. Eventually, language incorporating  the intent of my amendment was ac cepted by both sides during confer ence.  I fully recognize the threat to U.S.  competitiveness and security of allow ing critical U.S.  technology  to  leave  this  country  in  an  indiscriminate  flood. It is clear to me that our export  control system is still not operating at  its potentially optimum level, but this  legislation provides us with the base  on which to build a realistic and uni fied U.S. export policy, and I heartily  applaud its ps.ssage and eventual en actment.  ",1985
878,329,13,Mr.  GARN.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate has spent a good deal of time  lately  agonizing  about why  Japan  seems to be having a hard time hear ing our message on the trade  issue.  When one stops  to  think about  however, the answer is simple: Based  it,  on past experience, they have nothing  to worry about.  The fact is that even when the most  grievous  trade  practices  have been  brought to light in the recent past, the  United States has simply rolled over. I  can think of no better example than  an issue on which I have spent a good  deal of time writing articles and letters  in  the past year-machine  tool  im ports.  Sixteen months ago-I  repeat,  16  months-the Secretary of Commerce,  with the support of the Secretary of  Defense, sent an urgent report to the  President concerning machine  tools.  Although the report is classified, I am  told it warns that machine  tool  im ports from Japan threaten the nation al security of this Nation.  That report, filed under the provi sions of section 232 of the Trade Act,  recommends that temporary limits be  placed on imports of machine tools in  certain  defense-sensitive  categories.  Let me emphasize,  this  is a  finding  based purely on a national defense  analysis  that our country  is endan gered by the current level of machine  tool  imports. That  is  not  a  light  matter.  Not  surprisingly,  as  soon  as  the  report was transmitted to the White  House,  lobbyists  for  Japan  began  crawling all over the place. While they  got nowhere on Capitol Hill, they ap parently  succeeded  at  the White  House where the issue had come to  rest.  There this recommendation has sat  for well over a year despite repeated  attempts by Members of Congress and  key Cabinet officers to get the issue to  the President.  I see the Senator from Missouri on  the floor, and I know he is familiar  with the situation on machine tools. I  remember that during the last Con gress, he and Senator Percy engaged  in a lengthy discussion on the issue on  the floor. They were,  I believe, at tempting  to prod  the White House  into some kind of action on the recom mendation of Secretary Baldrige. Per haps, Senator DANFORTH,  you were  being too subtle.  Apparently subtlety doesn't work, so  let me be blunt. The fact is that Japan  clearly feels it has nothing to lose con cerning the machine tool issue. I know  with certainty that key U.S. officials  have told Japanese officials and lobby ists flat out that they have nothing to  worry about-there is no intention of  getting this issue to the President for  his objective decision.

882,342,13,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to commend an individual  and an organization. Both have made  significant contributions to the cause  of finding a cure for Alzheimer's dis ease.  First, I salute Princess Yasmin Aga  Khan for her many personal efforts  not only in leading fundraising activi ties, but also  in making  the public  aware of this terrible disease. Yasmin's  mother, Rita Hayworth, suffers from  Alzheimer's and I can assure all the  Members of this body that Yasmin has  done much more than lend her famous  name to a cause. She has worked for  increased funding for research which  is so critical to our efforts to cure this  devastating disease. Yasmin has also  given her time and resources  in her  continuing effort to keep Members of  Congress  informed of  the need  for  Federal funding of Alzheimer's disease  research. I believe Yasmin has been in strumental in informing thousands of  Americans of the ever-growing cost of  caring for Alzheimer's patients and of  the most difficult burden  faced by  families caring for an individual who  suffers from this ailment. Yasmin has  watched  this  disease  overcome her  mother  and has been  a  leader  in  searching to find treatment for its vic tims.  Yasmin Khan has worked with an  important association known as  the  Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dis orders Association  [ADRDAJ.  This  outstanding organization has led the  way  for  increased understanding of  the disease, which affects an individ ual's memory, personality, and is the  fourth leading cause of death. I credit  the ADRDA for helping family mem bers of victims of Alzheimer's to work  with  researchers  and  professionals  dealing with the tragedies of this dis ease.  My mother  is  a member of  the  Siouxland Chapter  of ADRDA  in  South Dakota, and I can tell you from  personal experience that this fine or ganization  is extremely helpful and  supportive of the families of Alzhei mer's victims.  Alzheimer's disease  is  the  fourth  leading cause of death in the United  States today. Yet, so much is still un known about this disease. How do we  treat Alzheimer's? Is Alzheimer's pre ventable? Can we find a genetic trait  for this disease? These questions and  so many more  remain unanswered.  The  answers will  only  be  found  through continued research.  Through  the  efforts  of  Princess  Yasmin Aga Khan and members of  the Alzheimer's Disease and Related  Disorders Association, it is hoped that  we will be able to soon put an end to  this devastating disease.  I want  to  commend Princess Khan and all the  members of the ADRDA for their con tinued commitment  to  the cause of  finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease.  ",1985

884,342,13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  clerk will call the roll.  ,1985
885,381,13,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, I  am today  introducing a bill entitled  the  ""Judicial  Survivors  Annuities  Reform Act of 1985."" I am introducing  this legislation in order to rectify a  glaring  insufficiency  in  the Federal  Judicial Survivors' Annuities Program.  The current Judicial Survivors' An nuities  Program  is  insufficient  to  ensure that Federal  judges can ade quately meet their obligations to their  families. Judges salaries are modest in  comparison to what they could make  practicing  law,  and all  the  lifetime  benefits they enjoy as members of the  Federal bench cease at their death.  Under  today's annuities program, a  judge with  limited personal capital  who dies after serving on the bench  for a number of years leaves his widow  and orphans with  just  a  pittance.  Judges appointed a decade ago have  seen their real income eaten away by  inflation,  leaving no opportunity  to  prepare adequately for their own un timely death.  If current conditions are allowed to  continue, an ever-increasing number  of  family-oriented  judges  will  be  forced to leave the bench. Moreover,  many  qualified  lawyers will weigh  their duties to family against the ben efits  of  the  judiciary  and  decide  against  seeking Federal  judgeships.  We would be ill-advised to allow judges  with years of experience to leave the  bench or to discourage capable lawyers  from joining the Federal judiciary.  In  response  to  letters he had  re ceived on the inadequacy of the exist ing survivors' annuity law, Chief Jus tice Burger created the Committee on  the  Judicial Branch of  the United  States to study the problem. During  the 97th Congress,  the chairman of  that committee, U.S. Court of Appeals  Judge Irving S. Kaufman, reported to  the  Senate  Subcommittee  on  the  Courts that ""financial pressures and  constant worry over them are divert ing judges' attention from their pri mary  respons;bilities.""  Judge Kauf man added that ""judges do not stand  to  benefit  directly  from  annuity  reform"", but that their benefit will be  in knowing that their survivors will  not pay an ""unconscionable price for  our continued devotion  to  the  law.""  Judge Kaufman  concluded  his  re marks by encouraging the Senate to  support the Judicial Branch Commit tee's reform proposal.  The bill I am introducing today is  substantially the same as the proposal  endorsed by Judge Kaufman in 1982.  While not  identical  to  the Judicial  Branch Committee's proposal,  I  be lieve the bill I am introducing today  will ameliorate many of the problems  with  the current system of  judicial  survivor's annuities, and it will help  ensure that our Federal judges are the  best lawyers at the bar.  ",1985
886,433,13,Mr. CHAFEE.," Over the last several  weeks there have been articles in the  Washington Post and the New York  Times on a number of problems facing  the National Park System.  The biggest of these problems are  external threats to park units-those  activities which occur outside park  boundaries but nevertheless have ad verse impacts on resources inside the  park. These impacts often arise as a  result of  federally  support projects  and activities on contiguous Federal  lands. For example timber harvesting  and oil and gas leasing on lands contig uous  to Yellowstone National Park  threaten the grizzly bear which often  need habitat outside the park's bound aries for its well-being.  Last year I  introduced the Wildlife  and the Parks Act which was aimed at  protecting native fish and wildlife spe cies found within the various units of  the park system. In June 1984,  the  Subcommittee on Environmental Pol lution held a hearing on this legisla tion  and  received  testimony which  confirms that threats to the parks are  real and are a problem. Concern over  the future of the parks prompted the  House  to pass  comprehensive park  protection legislation in the last two  Congresses.  As a result of this congressional in terest  the  Interior Department has  launched an initiative which would es tablish administrative procedures  to  resolve conflicts between parks and  other Federal land-managing agencies.  This certainly is a step in the right di rection although the actual implemen tation of any new policy directives has  yet to occur.  History  points  out  that  previous  well-intentioned efforts to protect the  parks have been sidetracked.  Sixty-six years ago,  in 1918, Secre tary of  the  Interior Franklin Lane  wrote  in a  letter setting  forth  the  policy  guidelines  of  the new Park  Service:  In considering projects involving the es tablishment of new national parks or the  extension of existing park areas by delimita tion of national forests, you should observe  what effect such delimitation would have on  the administration of adjacent forest lands,  and,  wherever  practicable,  you  should  engage  in an  investigation of such park  projects jointly with officers of the Forest  Service, in order that questions of national  park and national  forest policy  as  they  affect the lands involved may be thoroughly  understood.  In 1964 Secretary of  the  Interior  Udall wrote  to  the Director of  the  NPS:  In the development of  these goals and  procedures, I  think it is important to em phasize that effective management of the  National Park System will not be achieved  by programs that look only within the parks  without respect to the pressures, the influ ences, and the needs beyond park bound aries ... The concern of the National Park  Service is the wilderness, the wildlife, the  history, the recreational opportunities, etc.,  within the areas of the system and the ap propriate uses of these resources. The re sponsibilities  of  the  Service,  however,  cannot be solely within the boundaries of  the areas it administers.  Secretary Udall's Advisory Board on  Wildlife Management said this about  problems outside the parks:  ",1985

904,459,13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I do not  want to take a great deal of time at  the end of the day we are preparing to  leave for the 4th of July recess, but I  would be remiss if I did not rise at this  hour to note, despite the efforts of the  leadership on both sides  to try and  move  the  outstanding nominations,  apparently we are going to be unable  to  clear  for  approval  a  significant  number of nominees who have been  approved by  the Foreign Relations  Committee-unanimously,  I  might  add. There was not a single dissenting  vote that I am aware of in any of these  cases before us. We will now be gone  for the next 10 days or so, and I would  like to particularly point out that the  confirmation  of Thomas  Pickering,  who will be our Ambassador designate  for the State of Israel at one of the  crucial times in recent past history, is  crucially important with the fate of  some 45, 46 Americans hanging in the  balance, where it should become abun dantly clear to anyone how important  it is for the President of the United  States to be able to have an Ambassa dor functioning  in that part of the  world to help manage the delicate ne gotiations over the next several days  which could result in the release and  the return home, without harm and in  safety,  these Americans who  have  been caught in this web. If anything  happens over the next 10 or 12 days to  these Americans, we will look back and  wonder why, for some very petty rea sons, some were holding up the ap proval  of  these  nominations; why  when it was so vitally  important  to  this country to have people in place  the President could rely upon to help  move  this process  forward, he was  denied that opportunity  Now, there are any number of nomi nees, but I think the case of Thomas  Pickering  is particularly noteworthy,  and I might add John Whitehead, so  that  the Secretary of State might  have a deputy in place during these  times. These are not normal days at  the State Department and the White  House. It is a  time of crisis  in this  country. To find that we do not have  people on the job over these next 10  days, I  think, is a mistake of signifi cant proportions. I do not say this in  any partisan way, because I think, as  the majority leader and others know, I  certainly  have  had many  disagree ments with  any  number  of  these  people on policy questions. The issue  is whether or not  this Government  ",1985
905,472,13,Mr. FOLEY.," The President would  make that determination.  Mr. McCURDY. He could make that  determination and would not have to  ""consult"" with  the Congress? The  reason I  raise this is that this is an  item that has been raised continuously  on this floor and in the press, and the  United States has  said  consistently  that the introduction of Mig's or fight er aircraft into Nicaragua is a very se rious step and  that we  feel  that  is  threatening, and we would not accept  that. I wanted to enunciate or get that  statement from the gentleman in the  well.  I wanted to restate that even though  I  do  have  reservations  about  this  action. Last year it ended up being a  sense of the Congress, and I think this  is generally a sense of the Congress.  And if I had not received the Presi dent's letter only 2 or 3 weeks ago that  indicated that the policy vis-a-vis Nica ragua is for a political settlement in  the region, as it is in El Salvador, it is  not a military solution, that we are not  intending on introducing U.S. military  forces into Nicaragua, and it is not our  intention  to overthrow  the Govern ment of Nicaragua, and that this has  been a clear statement of policy by the  administration, and I think supported  by the Congress. I think we have had  a broad, general bipartisan statement  that that is indeed our policy.  Even though this may be redundant,  and in my opinion maybe even unnec essary, I think if the gentleman's ex ceptions are stated as he has indicated,  then perhaps there is no harm in the  gentleman's amendment.  I  am not  sure it is the best policy but I think as  a sense of the Congress that if these  statements are restated and they are a  restatement  of  current  American  policy, then I would have less concern  about the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back to the gentleman.  ",1985
906,472,13,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1985
907,472,13,Mr. FOLEY., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1985
908,472,13,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  I  am concerned about Mig aircraft be cause following a conversation I had  with the gentleman from Washington  I did some research on the range of  the Mig aircraft. And the critical sec tion of the Foley amendment refers to  clear and present danger to the United  States, its allies or possessions.  In fact, neither a Mig 25 nor a Mig  29 could make a round-trip mission to  the closest nation that would fit into  that category, which would probably  be Puerto Rico. They have approxi mately a 2,600-kilometer range.  So while it could be argued that a  Mig aircraft, because of  its  limited  range,  could not affect  the United  States, it could clearly raise Cain with  the neighbors, and I  think since the  gentleman has made it clear that he  intends that the introduction of Mig  aircraft into Nicaragua should be con sidered to be an exception, and to in validate this, then let me ask the gen tleman if he would accept an amend ment  that would state very plainly  that the introduction of Mig aircraft  would in fact be one of the conditions  under which the President could act  under the Foley amendment?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Washing ton [Mr. FOLEY] has again expired.  <By unanimous consent Mr. FoLEY  was allowed to proceed for 5 additional  minutes.)  ",1985
909,472,13,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Chairman, what I  have stated and will  repeat  is  that  under this amendment it will be left to  the President's discretion to determine  what  constitutes  a  threat  to  the  United States or  its  territories and  prossessions.  I do not want to make a judgment,  nor do I think the gentleman should  want  to make a  judgment  for  the  President on each  type of weapons  system or military supply that might  be provided to any country in Central  America  and  specifically  deal with  that item by item.  I can, however, assure him that this  is not designed to restrict the Presi dent's authority when he feels  that  there  is a danger, a  risk of hostile  attack to the United States or its terri tories or possessions, nor does  it re strict in any way our ability to act in  accordance with  the Rio Treaty.  I  think it covers all of those instances.  ",1985
910,472,13,Mr. HUNTER., Would the gentleman  accept an amendment on Mig aircraft  because Mig aircraft cannot reach the  United States or its allies or prosses sions?  ,1985
911,472,13,Mr. FOLEY.,  I will  state  for  the  record that that is a determination for  the President.  ,1985
912,472,13,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1985
913,472,13,Mr. FOLEY., I yield to the gentle man from Massachusetts.  ,1985
914,472,13,Mr. FRANK.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  First I want to say that I feel some what  reassured  to have my  friend  from California remind us  that the  Migs that might come there would not  threaten  the United States  itself.  I  think some rhetoric had been to the  contrary, and I  thank the gentleman  for that reassurance. It may be the  only one that I get this week, and I am  grateful.  But beyond that, I think the amend ment would be unwise as a general  principle for  this reason: There is a  legal principle that when you include  one you have excluded others.  0 1030  It sounds more impressive in Latin  but not when I say it. What you would  do, if you began to single out particu lar instances when it would be OK,  you would cast doubt on other  in stances which were not enumerated.  That is a very important legal princi ple. Once you begin to enumerate cer tain exceptions you then cast doubt on  other exceptions, and to back up what  the gentleman from Washington has  said, I have read, again in preparation  for this debate, the court decisions on  the subject: It is very clear what the  Supreme Court has said. If this Con gress says to the President, ""You may  act  in case of a  clear and present  danger"" the President's autonomy to  define that would be overwhelming. It  would be virtually unheard of for a  court to intervene and say there was  no clear and present danger. That is, it  would not be a case where there would  be a heavy burden at all on the Presi dent to meet it. So if you put this in  the way the gentleman has drafted it  you are not inviting the courts in fact  to be the arbiters in this situation, be cause if you read the opinions you will  find that it is virtually impossible for a  court in this kind of a situation to in tervene. You are giving the President  the standard. The standard is set forth  here.  If you then, having given the Presi dent the standards, begin to enumer ate exceptions, you are then in a posi-'  tion where people could say, ""O.K., he  could go in if we do this, but it does  not say he could go in if we do that.""  You would be  inviting that kind of  game-playing.  ",1985
915,472,13,Mr. FOLEY.," Reclaiming my time, I  appreciate the statement of the gen tleman from Massachusetts, because  that is exactly my concern. I do not  want to get into specific references to  each individual type of military equip ment because of the possible inference  if something is not mentioned.  I want  to give  the President, and  this amendment  intends  to give  the  President  the broadest authority  to  protect the United States, its territo ries,  and  possessions,  from  hostile  attack. It is not intended to be a re striction on his ability to do that. For  that reason I do not want to try to en vision all possible sources of  threat  and  list  them one by one  in  the  amendment. That would be neither  wise nor useful.  ",1985

Are  all  those  statements  just  so  many words? Is it not just as impor tant to our national security to stand  by our word as it is  to defend our selves? Clearly, our word has not been  given on this issue over and over and  over again.  So what we  have  here, my  col leagues, is an amendment that is basi cally a  restatement of that commit ment. It was a commitment that we  passed overwhelmingly in the defense  authorization bill  last year.  It has  been referred  to  time and  time and  time again in debate as a prohibition  against random use of United States  forces in that part of the world. All we  RECORDED voTE  ",1985

The statement made earli er by the gentleman from Georgia sug gests that when we appropriate funds  for any type of military engagement  around  the world  that Congress  is  giving tacit approval to a decision by  the administration to send American  troops. Examples were given by the  gentleman from Georgia of all the his tory of the United States where Con gress has indirectly, at least, support ed such an effort.  But what I suggest is a point made  by the gentleman from Connecticut as  one that should be before the body  today. Are we going to back into this  situation in Central America? By the  logic of the gentleman from Georgia,  there is a suggestion that sending hu manitarian assistance to the Contras,  which the House voted to do several  weeks ago, somehow opens the door  for the President to commit troops to  that country. I think that is not what  Congress was about several weeks ago,  nor is it consistent with the Constitu tion.  Mr. Chairman,  I  congratulate  the  gentleman on his remarks and I think  they are very pertinent to the discus sion.  ",1985

930,498,13,Mr. GINGRICH., The gentleman re ferred to my comments.  ,1985
931,498,13,Mr. GEJDENSON.,"  I would simply  like to finish my statement by saying  this: When we focus on the Constitu tion, when we focus on the particular  amendments that talk about the rela tionship between  the executive and  the legislative branch, it is vital to un derstand what the intent was. It was  not simply an adversarial relationship.  What was envisioned was the kind of  consultation that would bring a uni fied country  into a military engage ment and not a fractured country, a  country where we  entered  conflict  without censuring.  The Foley amendment, unamended,  as it exists now, will provide for that  kind of opportunity.  ",1985
932,498,13,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words and rise  in opposition  to  the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Indiana [Mr. BURTON].  Mr. Chairman, I have sought today,  despite some suggestions to the con trary, to give every reasonable oppor tunity that the President would con ceivably need to meet emergency con ditions, to protect the United States,  its territories and possessions, to pro tect American allies under  the Rio  Treaty, to protect against aggression,  to protect against terrorist actions, to  ensure the War Powers Act was pre served  in  every  instance,  including  those which send a  heavy warning  that we are not going to tolerate the  introduction of high-performance air craft.  Time and time again I have sought  to keep this debate from being charac terized as one in which the security of  the United States or its allies, or its  commitments, would be somehow, by  the adoption of this amendment, pre vented in their effectiveness. The gen tleman from Indiana [Mr. BuRTON], of  course, knows the administration has  already found that there are groups in  Nicaragua that are supporting insur gencies in El Salvador and Honduras.  That is already a finding.  The gentleman's amendment is tan tamount to authorizing immediate use  of military force in Nicaragua, without  the consent of Congress. That is what  his  amendment  is  tantamount  to  doing.  Eve:r,:ybody  in  this Chamber knows  that the conditions which the gentle man  from  Indiana has put  in his  amendment have already been stated  by  this  administration  and by  the  President  time and  time again, and  indeed, I do not even personally quarthen I will yield  to my friend from  Connecticut again.  One, the Korean analogy is exactly  correct, because right now, Nicaragua  is waging three wars in Central Amer ica. Right now  there  are guerrilla  movements  in Nicaragua which are  waging war in El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras, but because we define  war in our terms, they get away with  it.  Second, I would say to the gentle man, it is outrageous for the gentle man to suggest that Ronald Reagan is  responsible  because  an  American  sailor is killed by thugs in Lebanon.  ",1985

937,498,13,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman,  there have been a  number of eloquent statements made  on the floor about the constitutional  basis for this Congress' action, and the  right of the President to take action.  But what we  address here  is more  than simply a debate between the ex ecutive and the legislative branches of  Government.  In  examining  how  things  have  changed in the modern era, the rapid  escalation  of  technology  and  the  shortened response  time,  it becomes  more important than ever that we con sult the American people before the  executive or the Congress leads  this  country into a battle.  What the Foley amendment simply  does  is  guarantee  that before  this  country decides on a military course of  action that the American people be  consulted. Anything less than that will  lead us into the kind of engagement  that will create a void between this  country, its people, and its leaders.  If you examine the Foley language,  you will note that it does provide the  President  the ability  to  respond  to  emergencies. In the event of emergen cies in which quick action is needed,  the Foley amendment clearly gives the  President  the  prerogative  to  take  action. If we accept the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Indi ana [Mr. BuRTON] we will nullify ev erything that is accomplished by the  Foley amendment. It simply provides  the safeguards that I believe are nec essary  to provide  the  time  for  the  American people  to enter  into  the  dialog about  the policy we have  in  Central America.  .

946,511,13,Mr. DYMALLY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise in support of the Dellums amend ment. I have been bothered for some  time by the sense of priorities that is  reflected in our Federal budget. For  five budgets now I have sat here and  listened to my colleagues happily sing ing the virtues of increased military  spending. And in those same 5 years I  have  listened  to another  statistical  litany. That litany amounts to a blues  song for the American people. It is a  song of pain, a song of the decline of a  great people.  Our farmers cannot afford to grow  our food, and the President's response  was  to veto a modest effort to help.  Our children and many of our adults  can't read and write. But we pay our  teachers $12,000  a year and  justify  this disgrace with the refrain that it's  a  local, not a Federal problem. Our  women  are  raising  their  children  alone, and they are raising them in  poverty. And this Congress and this  President have not begun to address  this  multigenerational  tragedy  of  American life. Our so-called Equal Em ployment  Opportunity  Commission  tells us they can find no basis in law to  justify pursuing the concept of equal  pay for comparable work. And so our  women will continue to hold jobs for  which they will be paid only enough to  raise the children of America in an at mosphere of deprivation, want, and de spair. The aged of America plead with  us on a daily basis not to cut their  Social Security and Medicare. But we  tell them this is an era in which we  lawmakers must be fiscally  responsi ble. And everyone has to suffer a little  to relieve  the burden of the deficit.  They write back their quietly accusa tory letters saying, ""What of General  Dynamics?""  We have a reply, however. It is that  we must provide certain privileges to  the rich and to the corporations they  control because feeding  their wealth  will produce more wealth. And that's  good  for America, we  say. But  the  aged suspect corporate wealth is not  going to pay their medical bill anytime  soon, and the bellies of the children of  our working  single mothers are no  more full as a result of this solace we  bring them.

949,524,13,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment I am offering this after noon has two objectives: One, it would  establish a requirement for annual re ports to the Congress regarding the  actual cost savings achieved through  contracting-out of services within the  Department of Defense; and  two,  it  would establish a  higher and more  conservative standard for converting  in-house services to the private sector.  The purposes of my amendment are  straightforward. First,  by  requiring  annual reports to the Congress con cerning  the  relative effectiveness of  contracting-out in the Department, we  will be in a much better position to  evaluate this program over the next  several years.  Our experience with contracting-out  in DOD over the last several years has  been mixed at best. The most recent  evidence we have that may be used to  evaluate this program is an April 15,  1985, GAO report. The audit covered  20 functions converted to contractor  operation between 1978 and 1981.  The major  conclusions  from  this  cost data are: First, overall estimated  savings of nearly $14 million was re duced to about $2 million; and second,  the estimated savings of 42 percent  was reduced to 7 percent over the 3year period, equaling 2.3 percent per  year.  To address this concern, the second  part of my amendment would increase  the cost-differential used for convert ing in-house functions to the private  sector  from  the  current 10-percent  level to 15 percent. This is the same  threshold used by the Veterans' Ad ministration.  With 115,000 civil service jobs under  review for possible conversion by fiscal  year 1988, I strongly recommend this  more conservative approach to spend ing taxpayer's dollars. I urge the adop tion of my amendment.  ",1985

953,537,13,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. RICHARDSON:  At the end of title X (page 200, after line 4),  add the following new section:  SEC. 1050. PROHIBITING THE DEPARTMENT OF DE FENSE AND THE CENTRAL  INTELLI GENCE AGENCY FROM PROVIDING AS SISTANCE TO THE NICARAGUAN RE SISTANCE FORCES.  None of the funds appropriated pursuant  to the authorizations of appropriations in  this Act may be obligated or expended by  the Department of Defense or the Central  Intelligence Agency to provide any humani tarian assistance to the Nicaraguan resist ance forces.  ",1985
954,537,13,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I offer this amendment simply to clari fy the intent of the House on the issue  of humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan  resistance forces. I supported the bi partisan  McDade-McCurdy-Michel  amendment to the supplemental ap propriation as a way of promoting a  negotiated settlement to conflicts  in  the region. Support for humanitarian  aid to the Contras and economic sanc tions keeps pressure on the Sandinis tas to negotiate, implement democrat ic  reforms, and restrain  their forces  from  incursions  into  neighboring  countries.  With  this amendment, we  send a  clear message to the conference com mittee  that the DOD and  the CIA  should not be  involved  in providing  humanitarian aid  to  the Contras.  I  have contacted AID and they have in formed me that AID has other sources  of transportation besides the Depart ment of Defense. This  amendment  does not take any teeth out of the bi partisan amendment,  it clarifies our  intent.  I know that some of my colleagues  may argue that the conference report  on the defense authorization for fiscal  year 1984 already prohibits the DOD  from providing humanitarian aid  in  such instances. But I must point out  that was not a multiyear provision; it  applies only to fiscal year 1985. Some  might wonder why I did not wait till  the  intelligence authorization comes  to the floor. Well, the main point is  not to wait until after the conference  committee works on  the bipartisan  amendment. Another point of clarifi cation  is  that this amendment does  not refer to any other than humanitarian aid. It does not refer at all to  sharing  intelligence, a debate which  came up during  the debate on  the  McDade-McCurdy-Michel amendment.  And this amendment does not refer to  funds other than those appropriated  under this act.  I urge my colleagues to send a strong  signal  to  the conference committee  and the American people, that our in tention, whether we supported the bi partisan amendment or not, is not to  involve the CIA and DOD in humani tarian assistance to the Contras.  First,  the  bipartisan  amendment,  McCurdy-McDade-Michel,  contains a  provision for humanitarian aid to the  Nicaraguan resistance forces which ex cludes the provision of funds for this  purpose to the DOD or CIA.  Second, this House can send a clear  signal to the American people and to  the conference committee that we are  opposed to any DOD or CIA involve ment in the humanitarian assistance  transport or distribution.  Third, humanitarian  assistance  to  military  forces  is prohibited during  fiscal year 1985 by last year's confer ence  report on DOD authorization.  Section 1540(d), of Public Law 98-525.  This prohibition applies only to fiscal  year 1985. My amendment does not ex clude humanitarian  aid  to military  forces.  It does  say  that  such  aid  cannot be handled by  the DOD or  CIA. Thus, it extends only part of the  fiscal year 1985 prohibition.  Fourth,  thus both  the House and  the  other  body  accepted  a much  stronger prohibition of humanitarian  aid. The  internationally  recognized  definition of ""humanitarian"" excludes  such aid to military forces and for po litical purposes. We have  redefined  ""humanitarian""  in order  to provide  such aid to the Nicaraguan resistance  forces. Let us not  further  redefine  ""humanitarian"" to include the distri bution of such aid by U.S. Department  of Defense or CIA personnel.  Fifth, this amendment does not tie  anyone's hands. After some consulta tion with my colleagues on the Armed  Services Committee, the term ""other""  was  stricken  from  the amendment.  This means  that my  amendment  would not prohibit the DOD or CIA  from other activities besides the provi sion of humanitarian aid. Thus, shar ing intelligence is not banned by my  amendment,  although  I  do  support  the Boland amendment and will sup port it when we have the opportunity  to vote on it again.  Sixth, one of the leaders of the FDN  has stated that he will use this ""hu manitarian aid"" in order to buy weap ons.  Imagine such statements being  made after  the DOD  trucks deliver  supplies. We want to keep a distance  between  the DOD and  the Contra  forces.  Seventh, if we fail to make our message clear, it will be difficult for us to  ever use the term ""humanitarian as sistance"" again, when aiding resistance  forces.  Eighth, AID has sufficient resources  to  transport and distribute  the hu manitarian assistance. I have been in formed by an AID official that AID  does  have  the  ability  to  transport  these goods. I understand that some  Members were preoccupied about this.  I want to point out that the bipartisan  amendment would contain the same  problem. The language there also ex cludes the DOD and CIA from receiv ing funds for humanitarian assistance.  Ninth, I voted for the humanitarian  assistance to the Contras. And I urge  my colleagues, whether you supported  the bipartisan amendment or not, to  send a clear message on the sort of  contact with the Contras that is ap propriate when it comes to DOD and  CIA.  Tenth, this amendment asks for less  than what the DOD conference report  mandated  in 1984 and only clarifies  our intent in 1985.  ",1985

961,537,13,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the  gentleman  explain,  is  this  an  amendment that was, in fact, printed  in the RzcoRD, or has this been modi fied?  ",1985
962,537,13,Mr. RICHARDSON., This  amend ment  was  printed  in  yesterday's  RECORD  in its corrective form. It un derwent one revision to accommodate  some of the interests of the minority  and it is so reflected in the RECoRD of  yesterday.  ,1985
963,537,13,Mr. COURTER., The gentleman  is  saying the minority has looked it over  and agreed to it?  ,1985
964,537,13,Mr. RICHARDSON., Yes.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  question is on the amendment offered  by the gentleman from New Mexico  [Mr. RICHARDSON].  The amendment was agreed to.  ,1985
965,550,13,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  the rule, the previous question is or dered.  Is a separate vote demanded on any  amendment to the committee amend ment  in  the nature of a  substitute  adopted  by  the Committee  of  the  Whole?  ",1985
966,550,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  demand a  separate vote on  the so called McCollum amendment.  ",1985
967,550,13,The SPEAKER pro  tempore.,"  Is a  separate vote demanded on any other  amendment?  The Clerk will  report  the amend ment on which a separate vote has  been demanded.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment: At the end of title X <page  200, after line 4>  insert the following new  section:  SEC. 1050. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT UNDER UCMJ FOR  ESPIONAGE.  (a)  IN GENERAL.-Chapter 47 of title 10,  the United States Code (the Uniform Code  of Military Justice), is amended by inserting  after section 906 <article 106) the following  new section <article>:  ""§ 906a. Art. 106a. Espionage  ""(a)(l) Any person subject to this chapter  who, with intent or reason to believe that it  is  to be used to the injury of the United  States or  to  the advantage of a  foreign  nation,  communicates, delivers,  or  trans mits, or attempts to communicate, deliver or  transmit, to any foreign government, or to  any faction or party or military or naval  force within a foreign country, whether rec ognized  or  unrecognized  by  the United  States, or  to any  representative, officer,  agent, employee, subject, or citizen thereof,  either directly or indirectly, any document,  writing, code book, signal book, sketch, pho tograph, photographic negative, blueprint,  plan, map, model, note, instrument, appli ance, or information relating to the national  defense, shall be punished by death or other  such punishment as a court martial may  direct.  ""(2) The sentence of death may not be im posed for an offense under paragraph < 1 >  unless  the members of  the court martial  further find that the offense directly con cerned""<A>  nuclear weaponry, military  space craft or satellites, early warning systems, or  other means  of  defense  or  retaliation  against large-scale attack;  ""(B) war plans;  ""(C) communications intelligence or cryp tographic information; or  ""(D) any other major weapons system or  major element of defense strategy.  ""(b) Any person subject to this chapter  who, in time of war, with intent that the  same shall be communicated to the enemy,  collects,  records,  publishes,  or  communi cates, or attempts to elicit any information  with respect to the movement, numbers, de scription, condition, or disposition of any of  the Armed Forces, ships, aircraft, or war  materials of the United States. or with re spect to the plans or conduct, or supposed  plans or conduct of any naval or military  operations, or with respect to any works or  measures undertaken for or connected with,  or intended for the fortification or defense  of any place, or any other information relat ing to the public defense, which might be  useful to the enemy, shall be punished by  death or other such punishment as a court  martial may direct.  ""(c) Except as set forth  in this section,  sentencing under this section shall be deter mined pursuant to procedures set forth in  the Manual for Courts-Martial. The mem bers shall consider all relevant matters pre sented in aggravation and extenuation and  mitigation. The members shall return spe cial findings identifying any mitigating fac tors and any aggravating factors set forth in  subsection (d) or <e> that are found to exist.  If one of the aggravating factors set forth in  subsection <e>  is  found  to exist, a special  finding  identifying any other aggravating  factor may be returned. A finding of such a  factor by the members shall be made by  unanimous vote. If no aggravating factor set  forth in subsection <e> is found to exist, the  members  shall  impose  a  sentence, other  than death, authorized by  law. If one or  more of the aggravating factors set forth in  subsection (e) is found to exist, the mem bers shall then consider whether the aggra vating factor or factors found to exist suffi ciently outweighs any mitigating factor or  factors found to exist, or in the absence of  mitigating factors, whether the aggravating  factors are themselves sufficient to justify a  sentence of death. Based upon this consider ation, the members by unanimous vote shall  return a finding as to whether a sentence of  death is justified. Upon a finding that a sen tence of death  is  justified,  the members  shall sentence the accused to death. Other wise the members shall impose a sentence,  other than death, authorized by law.  ""(d) In determining whether a sentence of  death is to be imposed on the accused, the  following mitigating factors shall be consid ered but are not exclusive:  ""(1) The accused was less than 18 years of  age at the time of the offense.  ""(2) The accused's capacity to appreciate  the wrongfulness of his conduct or to con form his conduct to the requirements of law  was significantly impaired, but not so  im paired as  to constitute a defense  to  the  charge.  ""(3) The accused was under unusual and  substantial duress, although not such duress  as constitutes a defense to the charge.  ""(4) The accused is punishable as a princi pal <as defined in section 877 of this title) in  the offense, which was committed by an other, but his participation was relatively  minor, although not so minor as to consti tute a defense to the charge.  ""(5) Any other factor the President may  set forth  in  regulations prescribed under  section 836 of this title <article 36).  ""(e) If the accused is found guilty of an of fense under this section, the following ag gravating factors shall be considered but are  not exclusive:  ""(1) The accused has been convicted of an other offense involving espionage or treason  for which either a sentence of life imprison ment or death was authorized by statute.  ""(2) In the commission of the offense the  accused knowingly created a grave risk of  substantial danger to the national security.  ",1985
968,602,13,Mr. ASPIN.," Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the engrossment  of  the House  amendment  to  the  Senate bill, S. 1160, the Clerk be au thorized to make such technical cor",1985
969,628,13,Mr. WALKER., And it is an attempt  to-,1985
970,628,13,Mr. BRYANT., May I ask the gentle man from Georgia to yield?  ,1985
971,628,13,Mr. WALKER., Has the gentleman  yielded to me?  ,1985
972,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., Yes; go ahead.  ,1985
973,628,13,Mr. WALKER.," We are compounding  the error with discourtesy.  It seems to me that what we have  here is a situation where we are simply  trying to explain that we think that a  very disgraceful incident took place on  the House floor, and I am surprised,  given the nature of the incident that  we just described, that the Members of  the majority side are attempting  in  some way to defend that kind of con duct.  ",1985
974,628,13,Mr. BRYANT., Will  yield?  ,1985
975,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I am not sure I- ,1985
976,628,13,Mr. BRYANT., To  the gentleman  from Texas who was present at the  time of this incident?  Will you yield?  ,1985
977,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I will yield to the  gentleman from Texas.  ,1985
978,628,13,Mr. BRYANT.," I would  like  to ask  the gentleman if he would be willing,  in view of the fact that he has right eously proclaimed  that he has been  fair  in giving notice  to everyone  in volved that he intended to have this  special order tonight, in the absence of  the majority  leader,  if he would be  willing to grant to me 5 minutes that I  might make a case for our side, unin terrupted. Just a grant of 5 minutes.  Would you yield 5 minutes to me?  ",1985
979,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH.," I will yield to you  for the moment, go ahead.  ",1985
980,628,13,Mr. BRYANT.," Will you yield to me  for 5 minutes, that I might make my  case without clever and well-planned  interruptions of  the presentation of  our side? Will you or will you not; it is  a simple question of fairness.  ",1985
981,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., No; I will not.  ,1985
982,628,13,Mr. BRYANT., I  think that speaks  for itself.  ,1985
983,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., Let me  why I will not.    ,1985
984,628,13,Mr. BRYANT., It does not matter  why you will not. There is no reason.  ,1985
985,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH.," I want you to feel  what it is like to be in the minority.  You do not have the floor, you are not  getting  the floor on your  terms, so  then you can walk off the floor-be cause you would not talk except on  your-in other words,  if you cannot  control, you cannot talk?  ",1985
986,628,13,Mr. WALKER., Will the gentleman  yield?  ,1985
987,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I yield to the gen tleman.  ,1985
988,628,13,Mr. WALKER., I would say that I be lieve that it was the gentleman; and  the gentleman might want to confirm  this with the gentleman who told me  in the well that I was not permitted on  his side of the House of Representa tives.  ,1985
989,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., Was that the same  gentleman that just left?  tell you  ,1985
990,628,13,Mr. WALKER.,"  I  think the gentle man who just spoke here was one of  the gentlemen who, during the inci dent on the floor tonight, pushed me  back and told me that I was not per mitted on  their side of  the House  Chamber.  It seems to me that that speaks for  itself, too, because the gentleman obvi ously really did not want to speak to  the issue; there is no case to be made.  So  the gentleman  raises a phony  issue. The gentleman  from Georgia  had yielded to the gentleman; he could  have said anything that he wanted to;  and  instead he walks off  the  floor,  having been a part of  the  incident  himself.  0 2120  ",1985
991,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH.," Let me say that I  was  intrigued when  the gentleman  from Texas just came in and asked, be cause as a teacher, I, once upon a time,  during the period when we were going  through integration in Georgia and we  had great difficulty, I was once asked  to come in and teach in a high school  that had great problems trying to un derstand what it had been like to have  lived under segregation. And I taught  a course  in which  I had all of the  white students sit at the back of the  room  and  I  required  them  to not  speak,  to not be  involved, and  in a  matter of several weeks their parents  began to call. They began to get very  upset because Johnny or Sally would  come home and tell them, and they  would say, ""Why are you offending my  child? Why are you making my child  feel bad?""  And the point we were driving at was  to try to get those young people who  had never before felt segregation to  have some sense of what it was like to  live in a system in which they would  always lose, they would never have a  chance to play and to control and to  dominate.  I think it is fascinating. I would sus pect  that  if  the Democrats  in  this  House tried to live under the kinds of  rules the Republicans normally func tion under, that they would fail in a  matter of days, that they would find it  intolerable and outrageous.  ",1985
992,628,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1985
993,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I would be glad to  yield to the gentleman.  ,1985
994,628,13,Mr. WALKER.," I think it is interest ing that the two gentleman who came  to  the  floor  to discuss  it expressed  their sense of outrage that the gentle man would not yield to them and had  no sense of outrage that two Members  of  the  minority  were  physically  threatened by one of their leaders. I  mean that kind of outrage does not  occur to them, but the outrage that  somehow they would not be yielded  sufficient time to speak, that is some how a major crisis with them, despite  the fact that the gentleman had yielded. It is just one more example of the  incredible level at which we operate.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1985
995,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I yield to the gen tleman from California [Mr. HUNTER].  ,1985
996,628,13,Mr. HUNTER.,"  I  think one point  that was made by the two gentlemen  on  the other side who came  in  to  defend  their  leaders was  that  they  think it is appropriate that the leader  have an opportunity to respond, and I  think that is the feeling of everybody  who has spoken here. Clearly, the two  gentlemen who were  affected have  made their case, and I think it is prob ably appropriate to say that this is the  last day of the session and we are not  going to be back for 10 days, but I  think it is appropriate to give the ma jority leader an opportunity to  take  out an order with the gentlemen who  are here to discuss the situation. And  the indications that I have from the  two people who represented his point  of view and defended him,  that he  have that opportunity. So I  think it  would be appropriate.  ",1985
997,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., And  I  think  it  would be fair to say that certainly the  gentlemen on our side of  the aisle  would be more than willing to sched ule  the  time  if  the majority  leader  wants to meet with them and have a  special order and discuss it.  ,1985
998,628,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1985
999,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH., I yield to the gen tleman from Pennsylvania.  ,1985
1000,628,13,Mr. WALKER.," I assume that if the  majority leader wants to come to the  floor right now and present his side of  this case, the gentleman from Georgia  would be very pleased to yield to him.  ",1985
1001,628,13,Mr. GINGRICH.,"  I would yield  to  him virtually all the time which is left.  But let me say that the real point  today is not whether someone got mad  or someone lost their tmeper. The real  point today is  that three times in 1  day the Republican side was cheated,  three  times  in 1 day we got a  fast  count, a  short count, but  the basic  ground  rule was  that we were not  going to win.  Now, it is hard enough to play under  rules that are adopted on the first day  of the session in a manner in which  the Democrats guarantee  that  they  will have much more power than their  share  of  the  numbers.  It  is  hard  enough to work under a system where  the committees are  stacked against  the Republicans, despite the votes we  get back home, despite the number of  seats we have. It is difficult enough to  work  in committees where not only  are we outnumbered  in the commit tees disproportionately, but the staffs  are absurdly massive on the side of the  Democratic  Party.  It  is  difficult  enough  to deal  in a  system where  again and again we will turn up phys ically, we will be in the room, and with  pieces of paper the Democratic chair",1985

1065,654,13,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  the  situation in South Korea demands our  attention and concern. The Chun Doo  Hwan  government  currently  allows  little power to the National Assembly,  and has not accepted the opposition  party's call for a constitutional amend ment  allowing  direct  elections  for  President. Kim Dae Jung and other  important opposition leaders continue  to experience constraints on their ac tivities. Disturbingly, the recent pro tests against these policies have taken  on an increasingly anti-American tone.  With 40,000 troops stationed in Korea  and a  long history of friendship be tween our two countries,  the United  States has an important role to play in  this crucial time.  To fully understand the current situ ation  in South Korea,  I  submit  a  recent article from the Evening Sun  written by Stanley A. Blumberg.  The article follows:  [From the Evening Sun, June 17, 19851  OPPRESSION IN KOREA  <By Stanley A. Blumberg)  SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA.-There is little dif ference between leftand right-wing dicta torships. The  left espouses a philosophy  that decries the exploitation of man by man  and  sets  forth  lofty moral goals  to be  achieved by centralizing the means of pro duction in an all-powerful state. The right  makes the government the ally of dominant,  self-aggrandizing private economic interests.  For  the common citizen,  the effects are  often the same, or, to paraphrase Gertrude  Stein: a dictatorship is a dictatorship is a  dictatorship.  This is easy to understand. For both right  and left dictatorships are without oversight  by an opposition party and have no fear  that a free press might expose corruption  and oppression.  There are many similarities between the  Soviet Union and South Korea. Moscow has  the dreaded KGB, while Seoul nurtures its  counterpart, the Korean CIA. Both organi zations are subject only to the will and di rection of their respective dictators. These  intelligence agencies  routinely arrest,  jail  and torture citizens who have the courage  to attempt to speak out against the excesses  of the regime.  Thought control is a common element in  both countries. Hitler shocked  the world  when he ordered that ""unacceptable"" books  be burned. And yet  there  is  little public  outcry when Seoul and Moscow confiscate  and ban ""undesirable"" books and periodi cals.  ""I do not wish to alarm you,"" my Korean  friend said, ""but from the time you arrive at  the Seoul airport you may expect to be fol lowed. The phone in your hotel room will be  tapped and your luggage could be searched  during your absence.""  Attempts at thought control and media  censorship have been a constant ingredient  in Korean President Chun Doo Hwan's ef forts to maintain his dictatorship. In 1980,  ",1985
1066,680,13,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to introduce once again a reso lution to designate a week for the rec ognition of a most serious and debili tating disease. This resolution will set  aside the week of October 6 through  October  12,  1985  as  ""Myasthenia  Gravis Awareness Week."" Last year  many of the Members of this body ap proved  this  resolution, and  I would  urge them to support me in this effort  again this year.  Myasthenia Gravis, also known as  Erb-Goldfam disease, is a neuromuscu lar disease which affects people of  both sexes, all ages and races. There  are currently over 100,000 victims in  America. The disease affects the syn apse-the gap which conducts the elec trical current from the nerve to the  muscle-and is  literally a breakdown  in communication.  Myasthenia Gravis is a very unpre dictable disease which can strike any  area of the body at any  time. It is  often misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue,  which allows the disease  to progress  until the victim  is  in severe danger.  Until  recently, Myasthenia Gravis  proved to be fatal for 85 percent of its  victims. There is still no prevention or  cure,  but  there  has  been  great  progress in research.  By establishing ""Myasthenia Gravis  Awareness Week,"" Congress will be  calling attention to the problems vic tims face daily. Hopefully by stimulat ing interest in this disease, there will  be  increased  research which would  lead to a better understanding of this  disease and eventually a cure.  Over the years our Nation has been  very  successful  in  conquering  or  making progress to conquer many terJune 27, 1985  rible diseases; it is resolutions such as  this that have greatly aided in these  successes.  I hope that all of my colleagues will  join me in approving this resolution.   NONEXISTENCE  OF  FEDERAL  RESERVED WATER RIGHTS  IN  WILDERNESS AREAS  HON. MICHAEL L. (MIKE) STRANG  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 27, 1985   ",1985
1067,680,13,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Speaker, on a  prior occasion,  I  submitted  for  the  record and for the benefit of my col leagues, my concerns about the con tention that the designation of wilder ness areas on Federal public lands car ries with it additional Federal reserved  water rights. My previous comments  urged my colleagues  to  take a close  look  at  this  issue  because States'  rights and water are  so  crucial  to  those of us from Western States. Obvi ously, I do not believe any such addi tional Federal  reserved water  rights  exist in wilderness areas. That point of  view is now supported by the Colorado  Water Congress, an organization of  professional  water  officials  from  throughout Colorado.  Earlier this year, I asked the Colora do Water Congress  to  look  into the  issue of alleged Federal reserved water  rights in wilderness areas. The conclu sion of  the Water Congress  states  that:       we cannot support additional wilder ness designations in Colorado, unless such  legislation contains an explicit declaration  that wilderness designation has not created  implied Federal  reserved water  rights  in  Colorado.  I offer the attached summary of the  Colorado Water Congress findings for  the further benefit of other Members  who are in the position of considering  wilderness  designations  for  their  States.  The material follows:  WILDERNESS  FEDERAL  RESERVED  WATER  RIGHTS: THEY Do NOT EXIST AND THE As SERTION THAT THEY Do Is AN OBSTACLE TO  ADDITIONAL WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS  IN  COLORADO  <Opinion submitted by Colorado Water  Congress, June 11, 1985)  PREFACE  On June 10, 1985,  the Colorado Water  Congress passed a  resolution which stated  in part:  ""Now,  therefore, be it resolved, That it is  the consensus of the Colorado Water Con gress  that wilderness  legislation covering  any area in Colorado should not be passed  unless it contains adequate safeguards for  present and future development of Colorado  water resources.

1068,693,13,Mr. RAY.," Mr. Speaker, If there is  any one word that could be considered  the ""key word"" around Washington,  DC this year, it would have to be defi cit. Everywhere your turn, people at  all  levels of Government are  talking  about reducing the deficit, controlling  the deficit, and cutting the deficit.  Unfortunately, a  lot of the talk  is  simply that-rhetoric without actions  behind it.  This month, we had a vote in the  House of Representatives that had se17965  rious  implications  for deficit  reduc tion. That vote  took place when we  considered a supplemental appropria tions bill the first week of June.  A supplemental appropriations bill is  supposedly designed to provide money  for programs and agencies that have  run short and are facing a real emer gency from lack of funds. This supple mental was  for  $13.49  billion,  and  there were some real emergencies in  the bill.  But, the House leadership hid a few  surprises in the package-pet projects  and special interest legislation to the  tune of $4.8 billion. Among the pork  barrel spending was $91,000 for House  leadership offices, $1 million more for  House  salaries, $1 million more  for  committee  employees,  $2.5  million  more for Members to use to hire per sonal staff, $669,000 for congressional  allowances and expenses, $204,000 for  salaries and expenses at  the White  House, $57,000 more for the executive  residence of the President, and $171  million for new water projects. Also,  additional foreign aid was in this bill,  at a time when we are cutting back on  many  programs  affecting  our  own  people.  You may not think a bill like this  could pass, but it did, by a vote of 271  to 156. It passed because Members of  the House didn't want to vote against  the good projects in the bill, in order  to defeat  the pork-barrel  spending.  The  leadership knew  that  the good  parts of the bill would carry their spe cial projects, and that's why they tied  them together. We call these measure  ""Christmas Tree"" bills, because under  them, you'll find a little something for  everyone.  When I voted against the bill, it was  a hard vote. It meant that I would  vote against some  legitimate educa tional provisions that were valid, food  stamp money,  nutritional  help  for  children, and an abortion clause that I  would normally support. But, I don't  think Congress should hide spending  bills in large packages, so that most  Americans won't know what we're  doing. This ploy is commonly used to  pass pay raises for Congressmen and  Senators and, in my mind, this is noth ing more than a complicated way to  hide what we're doing from the Ameri can people.  Legislative packaging is not an issue  that raises great debate, but it prob ably has a bigger impact on a bill's  future than almost any other factor.  The next time we consider a large, om nibus measure in this Congress, I urge  my colleagues to look to see what is in cluded in the bill. Most of the time,  you'll find a lot of pork-barrel spend ing hidden in the fine print, and you'll  understand why Congress keeps losing  the battle to reduce the deficit.e  ",1985
1069,706,13,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing,  with my distinguished colleague from  California, CARLOS MOORHEAD, and my  distinguished colleagues, a bill to pro vide a much needed solution to  the  problem of home audio  taping-the  Home Audio Recording Act. Home  taping of music is currently the single  greatest  threat  to America's music  community.  Our bill would accomplish two fun damental goals. First, it would exempt  from copyright liability those individ uals who engage in audio recording for  their private use. Second, the bill es tablishes a system of compensation for  creators and owners of copyrighted  material for the use of their creative  property.  The  accomplishment  of  these goals is crucial to the continued  vitality  of  the music  industy  and  indeed the entire creative process in  our country.  Mr. Speaker, the economic harm ex perienced by the music and recording  industries as a direct result of home  music  taping  in  recent years  is  as tounding. Over the past several years,  the amount of home audio taping has  increased  dramatically.  Recent  ad vances in audio taping technology and  the increased availability of inexpen sive, easy-to-operate, high-quality re cording devices have lead to virtual ex plosion of audio home taping.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Indeed,  the home  taping problem  has become so widespread that music  taping  is  actually  replacing music  buying. A  recent  survey  of  tapers  across the United States revealed that  in 1984 alone consumers would have  purchased an additional 325 million  albums and prerecorded tapes if they  had not been able  to  tape  them at  home.  The recording business is exceeding ly risky: 84 percent of records released  fail to even cover their costs. Record  companies rely on the revenues from  the occasional hit to subsidize releases  that fail to break even and to finance  new recordings by unknown artists.  Home taping siphons off the reve nues  that have  traditionally spured  the musical arts community to put its  labor and money at risk. The creative  and capital  investments  fostered by  our copyright system have brought  consumers a dazzling variety of musi cal offerings from which to choose and  enabled the American music industry  to set  the standard  for  the world.  Unless we ensure that the fruits of our  copyright system are not destroyed by  the growing practice of audio home  taping,  there ultimately will be  less  music for consumers to tape.  Thus, Mr. Speaker, it is in the con sumer's long-term best interest to es tablish a fair and reasonable system of  compensation to the creator, in order  to ensure continued public access  to  the widest possible diversity of cre ative works.  The element of compensation is also  critical because compensation for the  use of  intellectual property  is,  and  always has been, a necessary incentive  for  its creation. Society as a whole  benefits  because  compensation  to  copyright owners for their work pro vides  the impetus for  the continued  creation  of  intellectual work. The  basic premise of our copyright system  is that the payment of royalties serves  as both a  reward  for  the creator's  labor and an incentive to future crea tivity.  We must not abandon two centuries  of copyright doctrine just because the  complexities of a new technology chal lenge our ingenuity. It is a depressing  prospect to imagine a future devoid of  cultural diversity and experimentation  because we failed to act responsibly to  preserve  the  legal  foundation  on  which America's music  community  sustains itself financially. Our bill is  specifically designed  to prevent  this  from happening.  The Home Audio Recording Act,  which we are introducing today, would  provide the needed compromise solu tion  to  the home  taping  problem.  First,  it would exempt home audio  tapers  from  copyright  liability,  by  making it clear that individuals who  tape music for their private use would  not be  liable for copyright  infringe ment.  June 27, 1985  Next, the legislation specifies a roy alty on blank audio tapes and audio re cording equipment which would com pensate the creators and producers of  home taped music. The legislation re quires that the manufacturers and im porters of blank audio tape pay a one time royalty of 1 cent per minute of  playing  time.  For  audio  recording  equipment, the manufacturers and im porters would pay a one-time royalty  of 10 percent of the wholesale price.  Producers of dual cassette recorders machines designed specifically  to fa cilitate  the copying of music-would  pay a special, higher royalty of 25 per cent of the wholesale price.  These  royalties would be collected  by the Copyright Office and deposited  in a  royalty pool for distribution  to  copyright owners.  The use of the Copyright Office in stead of the Copyright Royalty Tribu nal is not intended in any way to make  a statement about the CRT's perform ance. That issue is currently being ex plored  separately  by  the  Judiciary  Committee's Subcommittee on Courts,  Civil Liberties and the Administration  of Justice, of which I am a member.  Rather, this transfer of functions  to  the Copyright Office has been includ ed in our legistation simply to indicate  that the bill can go forward independ ent of the CRT. Should Congress de velop an alternative mechanism  for  functions now being performed by the  tribunal, it would be a simple matter  to revise our legislation to incorporate  those changes.  Our legislation also contains provi sions designed to protect from paying  royalties  those persons who do not  tape  copyrighted music. Tapes  and  equipment used primarily for nonmu sic purposes,  such as dictation ma chines, would be exempt from the roy alty altogether. The Copyright Office  would be authorized to designate addi tional kinds of  tapes and  recording  equipment  for exemption. Organiza tions that us blank tapes for nonmusic  recording,  such  as  broadcasters  or  service groups for the blind and dis abled, would be able to purchase blank  tapes and equipment without paying  any royalties.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to  emphasize  that our  legislation per tains only to audio  taping. I do not  intend for this legislation to serve as a  vehicle  for  amendments  addressing  the video home taping problem or the  video first sale issue. It is my under standing that representatives of  the  motion picture industry do not intend  to pursue such legislative intitiatives  in this Congress.  I hope  that my colleagues  in  the  House will support our bill. It ensures  that the public will be able to tape for  private use, without risk of copyright  infringement  liability,  that manufac turers and importers will be able  to  ",1985
1070,719,13,Mr.  PARRIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  weekend former students of Hammond  High School in Alexandria, VA, will be  celebrating the reunion of the class of  1965. In the 20 years that have passed  since more than 600 students of this  class walked across the stage to receive  their high school diplomas, both the  students and  the city  they  lived  in  have changed dramatically.  The past two decades have seen are newal of the rich heritage of a pros perous port city founded by Scottish  merchants in 1749. From the recently  rennovated  Torpedo  Factory  Art  Center on the revitalized waterfront in  the eastern part of  the city  to  the  commercial  and  residential  develop ment of western Alexandria, there are  more  than  1,000  landmarks which  remind us of  the people who have  helped Alexandria grow for more than  two centuries.  The Hammond High School Class of  1965 has continued  the  tradition of  contributing to this community, by es tablishing a college scholarship fund  for graduating high school students  who show strong leadership qualities,  and by setting up a memorial fund for  Alexandria Hospital. These 20 years,  however,  have  not  passed without  sorrow.  Last  year,  the  class was  shocked by the tragic murder of their  class president, Dr. Robert Rixey. In  his memory, the class is contributing  over $1,000 to the Rixey Foundation, a  memorial scholarship fund for college bound students.  The  contributions  this  class  has  made are a tribute to the vibrant spirit  that has helped the city of Alexandria  flourish, and  I am grateful  for  the  commitment and assistance they have  provided to others in their communi ty.e  TRIBUTE TO GEORGE  MAVROMATIS  HON.

1071,719,13,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  bring  to  the  attention of my  colEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  leagues a man who has served his com munity for 40 years, George Mavroma tis will be retiring from his position  this summer as chief of police in his  hometown of Steubenville, OH. He has  touched many lives during his years of  service and has been an exceptional  leader to the residents of Steubenville.  Chief Mavormatis is a former World  War  II marine who  served  in  Iwo  Jima. He was  awarded  the Bronze  Battle Star and the Pacific Operations  Theatre Award. After the war he re turned to Steubenville and joined the  police force.  Chief Mavromatis walked  a  beat  then when he first  joined the force  and soon came  to know  the people  who resided on it. Because of this close  association, he was able to help many  young people who were headed for a  life of crime, which to him is worth  more than any medal a police officer  may be awarded during his lifetime.  The chief has never been afraid of  the consequences in lending a helping  hand to those in need around him. He  cares about his fellow officers' protec tion and safety as much as his own.  Due to his close association with the  people he  serves, Chief Mavromatis  has never had to fire his gun in the  line of duty in the 40 years that he  has been a police officer.  In addition  to  the protection  the  chief has given to his community, he  has also assisted  in establishing the  Steubenville Little League  and  the  Babe Ruth baseball programs. He has  received honors from the Knights of  Columbus and as the College of Steu benville's  first Alumni Outstanding  Citizenship Award. He was also  the  Fraternal Order of Police's ""Man of  the Year.""  Mr. Speaker, Chief George Mavro matis is an exceptional human being  who has served as an example of law  and order for 40 years and will be pro fessionally missed by the community  of Steubenville.  So, Mr. Speaker, this entry into the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  is but a small  recognition of a man for whom I have  great respect and admiration for the  love, dedication, and commitment he  gave to his community. Best wishes in  all your future endeavors, Chief.e  BREAKDOWN OF CONFERENCE  TALKS  HON. JIM ROSS LIGHTFOOT  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 27, 1985  e ",1985
1072,719,13,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to indicate my disappoint ment in the breakdown of the House Senate budget conference committee.  Mounting Federal  deficits must  be  dealt with quickly and fairly; however,  not at the expense of the Nation's 36  17991  million elderly retired persons. There fore, I implore the conferees to come  to an agreement without  tampering  with  cost-of-living  adjustments  for  Federal pension programs.  I think of many colleagues have for gotten or have failed to consider a few  things. For instance, just a short while  ago senior citizens were asked to take  a permanent cut  in Social Security  benefits when the COLA was delayed  for 6 months in 1983. This was sold to  the senior citizens as a necessary in gredient in ensuring the solvency of  the Social Security system. The senior  citizens accepted this delay and now  Social Security is experiencing a sur plus.  This surplus brings me  to another  point. At this time, we have no reason  to delay or reduce COLA's. The Social  Security trust fund is amassing a large  surplus. In fact, by 1990, according to  the Congressional Budget Office, the  Social Security trust fund under cur rent  economic  projections will  be  about $54 billion and growing. Besides,  the Social Security trust fund, which  is financed by employee and employer  payroll  taxes,  is not contributing  to  the Federal budget deficit. It is a self financing system with  its own  trust  fund.  Finally, and most important, the el derly depend heavily on Social Securi ty-two-thirds  get more  than  half  their income from  the program and  about one-third get more than 90 per cent of their income from Social Secu rity. Delaying or cutting the COLA's  would push over 200,000 senior citizens  below  the poverty  line. Tampering  with their COLA's would force many  senior citizens to chose between food  and  medicine,  a  situation  which  should not happen.  Last year, Social Security was great ly debated. President Reagan said he  would ""never"" cut or reduce Social Se curity benefits, yet he is considering it.  The Republican Party's platform also  pledged ""that we will adequately pro vide  for  them during  their golden  years so they can continue to enjoy  our country's high standard of living,  which their labors helped to provide.""  Yet, many of my counterparts in the  Senate are adamantly  insisting on a  COLA freeze.  I believe that the House Republicans  should stand up and let their Senate  counterparts know that we do not sup port a COLA freeze. The Senate Re publican  budget  conferees  are  not  speaking for many of us Republicans  in  the House when  they call  for a  COLA freeze.

This is the second resolution,  the first which I sponsored passed last  year,  to designate a  specific month  during which we  recognize  hospice  care as a humane  response  to  the  needs of the  terminally  ill, congres sional support for the hospice concept  goes back some years. The culmination  of that support was, of course, the in clusion of the hospice benefit in Medi care.  THE HOSPICE CONCEPT  ill  As the Senator from Kansas has in dicated in the past, hospice is a con cept of caring for  the terminally  and their families.  Its purpose  is  to  provide compassionate care enabling  the patient  to  live comfortably and  with personal dignity while also ad dressing the needs of individual family  members. The critical component of  hospice care is the delivery of services  by an interdisciplinary team of physi cians, registered nurses, social workers,  therapists, clergy and specially trained  volunteers. It is most often carried out  in the patient's own home so that he  or she can  remain  in  familiar  sur roundings  among  those people and  things most meaningful to the patient.  Inpatient care is also available should  it be necessary for symptom manage ment or respite care.  THE PAST  The January 22, 1978, issue of the  Washington Post contained a  front  page story in the Outlook section enti tled ""The Death of a Daughter."" The  story, written by Victor and Rosemary  Zorza, described the treatment provid ed by a British hospice to their 25year-old daughter who was dying of  cancer. The story provided a moving  portrayal of a family confronted with  a catastrophic event made worse by a  health  care delivery  system unpre pared or unwilling to deal with a dying  patient. Their decision to try a hos pice, and the positive experience re sulting from that choice, proved to be  of  tremendous  interest  to  certain  Members of the Senate at that time.  Subsequent articles by the Zorzas in  February and March of  that same  year urged U.S. acceptance of the hos pice  concept. Clearly  these  articles  were not the first  time hospice had  been mentioned, but they caught the  attention of three Senators in particu lar, myself, Senator Ribicoff and Sena tor KENNEDY.  Since 1978 a great many things have  taken place. The hospice movement  has grown by leaps and bounds-and  public support has grown. By Decem ber of 1981 the time had come to begin  in earnest our discussions on how best  to finance hospice services. On Decem ber 15, 1981, this Senator introduced  S. 1958, which provided for Medicare  coverage of hospice services.  It fol lowed the introduction of H.R. 5180 in  the House.  In September of 1982, the President  signed into law Public Law 97-248, the  Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 1982, which provided for the in clusion of hospice benefits under Med icare.  In recent years  the hospice move ment has offered critical support to  the dying patient. The extraordinary  contributions of this complete support  system, which includes medical, spirit ual, psychological, and social assist ance for the patient are well known.  Nevertheless, the Hospice Program is  too important to allow its integrity to  be jeopardized by a blind acclaim of its  objective that precludes appraisal of  problem areas. Clearly it is in all our  best interests to continue to support  this system of care while  improving  upon the law as currently designed.  THE PRESENT  Some  198 Medicare certified hos pices, employing a great many profes sionals  and  trained  volunteers  are  dedicated  to promoting  the hospice  concept-meeting  the physical, emo tional, and social needs of terminally  ill patients and  their families. This  number, however, is less than we had  hoped for originally. There have clear ly been problems with both the design  of the benefit and the calculation of  the rates paid for services. We have in  the last 2 years attempted to address  some of  these concerns. More work  clearly needs to be done. The enact ment of the hospice Medicare benefit  made hospice care a viable alternative  for many more elderly Americans but  ",1985
1074,758,13,The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,"  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Indiana?  There was no objection.  The Clerk read the bill, as follows:  H.R. 2694  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That the  United States Post Office Building located  at 300 Packerland Drive, Green Bay, Wis consin, shall hereafter be known and desig nated as the ""John W. Byrnes Post Office  and Federal Building"". Any  reference  to  such building in any law, map, regulation,  document,  record, or other paper of  the  United States shall be deemed to be a refer ence to the ""John W. Byrnes Post Office  and Federal Building"".  e Mr. McCLOSKEY. Mr.  Speaker,  H.R. 2694 is a bill introduced by the  gentleman from Wisconsin, the Honor able TOBY RoTH, and is cosponsored by  several members of the Wisconsin del egation.  John Byrnes served this House in a  distinguished manner for many years.  Although he was perhaps best known  for his achievements as the ranking  minority member of  the Ways and  Means Committee, he made many con tributions in other important areas of  the House's work, most particularly in  the fields of health care and trade leg islation. Naming a postal facility  in  Green Bay, WI, in his honor would be  a  fitting  tribute  to  the  life  and  achievements of John Byrnes.  H.R. 2694 was ordered reported by  the Committee on Post Office and  Civil Service on June 26 by voice vote.  On behalf of the committee, I urge its  passage.e  The bill was ordered to be engrossed  and read a  third time, was read the  third time, and passed, and a motion  to reconsider was laid on the table.  01220  NEW  JERSEY  INTERNATIONAL  AND BULK MAIL CENTER AND  MICHAEL McDERMOTT PLACE  Mr. McCLOSKEY. Mr. Speaker,  I  ask unanimous consent that the Com mittee on Post Office and Civil Service  be discharged from further consider ation of the bill <H.R. 2672) to redesig nate the New York International and  Bulk Mail Center in Jersey City, NJ,  as the ""New Jersey International and  Bulk Mail Center,"" and to honor the  memory of a former postal employee  by dedicating a portion of a street at  the New York International and Bulk  Mail Center in Jersey City, NJ, as ""Mi chael McDermott Place,"" and ask for  its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  ",1985
1075,758,13,The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Indiana?  ,1985
1076,758,13,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, as the sponsor  of H.R. 2672  I am pleased that the  House is now considering this bill to  correct a serious injustice to the State  of New Jersey and to increase public  consciousness of  the great need  to  ensure safety in the workplace. H.R.  2672 would redesignate the New York  Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center,  in  Jersey City, NJ, as the ""New Jersey  International and Bulk Mail Center.""  It would also dedicate the street lead ing into the facility to the memory of  Michael McDermott, a former postal  employee who lost his life in a tragic  industrial accident there.  I have offered this legislation in the  three previous Congresses. In the 97th  Congress, the House passed this meas ure by unanimous consent after the  Public Works and Transporation Com mittee reported the bill favorably in a  unanimous  expression of bipartisan  support.  Unfortunately,  time  con straints prevented the Senate's consid eration of  the bill before  they ad journed.  In  the 98th Congress,  the  House  again passed  the bill under  unanimous consent and  the Senate  passed an  amended version of  the  House bill. The House did not have a  chance  to act on  the amended bill  prior to adjournment. On June 26 of  this  year,  the Committee on Post  Office and Civil Service favorably re ported H.R. 2672. Its language reflects  extensive consultation between Mem bers of  the House and  the Senate  along with the guidance of the U.S.  Postal Service.  As I previously mentioned, this Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center is located in  Jersey City, NJ. For many years it has  been located there and has well served  both northern New Jersey and New  York. Yet oddly enough, although the  center is in New Jersey, we have con tinued to refer to it as the New York  Bulk and Foreign Mail Center.  This practice has been going on for  years and I see no justifiable reason to  continue  to misidentify  this center.  For  too  long New  Jersey has been  looked upon as merely a  suburb of  New York. It is time for us to acknowl edge the fact that this postal facility is  clearly  located  in New  Jersey  and  rightfully designate  it  as  the New  Jersey  International and Bulk Mail  Center. We must allow New Jerseyans  to be proud of being home to the larg est bulk mail facility  in the Nation.  New  Jersey  residents have  another  reason  to  take pride  in  their great  State.  My bill would also designate a por tion of  the roadway  leading  to  the  bulk mail center as ""Michael McDer mott Place."" For those of you who are  not familiar with the story of Michael  McDermott, I would like now to share  with you  the reasons for dedicating  this street to his memory.  Michael McDermott was a 25-year old employee at the New York Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center. On Decem ber 15, 1979, he tragically lost his life  when he became entangled in a faulty  conveyor. Safety devices which were  meant to prevent the kind of accident  which caused the death of this young  public servant had been removed to  speed the flow of mail at Christmas.  Designating a portion of this street  to the memory of Michael McDermott  will provide us with a monument sym bolizing  the sacrifice of all working  men and women who have lost their  lives in public service. It will be a con stant  reminder  to  the management  and the employees at the postal facili ty that safety in the workplace must  be a top priority.  This bill  to  redesignate  the bulk  mail facility  in Jersey City, NJ,  the  ""New Jersey International and Bulk  Mail Center"" and dedicate a portion of  the road leading into the center to the  memory of Michael McDermott would  help redress a grave  injustice to the  State of New Jersey. It would give  New Jersey residents another reason  to take pride in their State. Moreover,  it would pay tribute to a dedicated em",1985
1077,810,13,Mr. HARTNETT.," Mr. Speaker, even  at  this very hour as  I  stand here  before you and my colleagues in the  House, the Greek flagship, Constella tion Farros, is being loaded at the port  of Charleston, SC, with what is termed  to be humanitarian assistance for the  people of Lebanon.  Mr. Speaker,  I  find  it  inexcusable  that  our State Department would  permit a ship to be leaving the shores  of the United States and going to Leb anon under the guise of humanitarian  assistance at this time. Why do we not  hold that ship hostage until they re lease the other seven Americans who  are being held against their will?  Was it in the guise of humanitarian ism that our young naval officer was  brutally beaten and killed by hijackers  who were Lebanese and who held 39  Americans against their will for over  17 days?  I urge all my colleagues here on the  floor  today and  those who may be  watching in their offices to please pick  up their telephones and call the State  Department and ask them to embargo  the Greek flagship the Constellation  Farros, and have them hold that ship  until  the murderers  of our  young  naval officer are at least arrested and  brought to trial.  The President has said he wants jus tice  done,  he wants  these  killers  brought to justice. Why do we not, we  the American people,  hold hostage  this  humanitarian  support  for  the  country of Lebanon until those killers  of our American citizens abroad are  brought to justice.  I urge my colleagues to please call  the State Department and ask them to  have that ship embargoed.  THE NATIONAL DEBT: WE CAN'T  GO BACK TO THE FUTURE  <Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.>  ",1985
1078,810,13,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, in  response to the President's Saturday  comments on the deficit, I must say to  the President that unfortunately life  is not a movie.  Mr. Speaker, if we don't take imme diate steps to lower the national debt,  we will  be  holding  hostage  future  Americans. Today's national debt will  become the terrorist of the 1990's.  Unlike  the movie  ""Back  to  the  Future,""  there  is no  time machine  that our children and grandchildren  will be able to use to free themselves  from our irresponsible debt.  Dr. Emmett Brown is not in charge  of the Federal Reserve. Budget resolu tions are not fusion-powered DeLor eans. This is Congress, not a movie.  We are legislators. The President is no  longer an actor.  There are real consequences for our  actions. We can't go back to the future  after altering our actions. We must  take  responsible  action  now.  The  President must get  the Republican  Senate back to work. If he doesn't, the  consequences of not dealing with the  debt in 1985 will be crippling for the  citizens of 1995.  WHAT  TAXPAYERS OF MICHI GAN ARE SAYING ABOUT THE  BUDGET  <Mr. PURSELL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
1079,810,13,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker, today I  will continue my series of  !-minute  speeches on what the  taxpayers are  saying about the budget.  Many of my constituents in Michi gan's Second District have written me  demanding that we reduce the deficit.  Robert W. Young of Hillsdale, Ml,  writes:  Unless Government spending is curbed, we  will become an example of what Marx called  ""decadent capitalism,"" a Nation  that col lapsed as a result of reckless spending, self  interests, and poor planning.  Mr. Young continues:  The Founding Fathers  intended a Con gress which could think and act in the inter est of these United States, not a Congress of  special interests.  Thank you, Mr. Young.  We need a budget resolution that's  fair, that will provide for real savings.  Might I suggest in closing that, if you  don't believe  either  the House  or  Senate position is either fair or con tains real savings, take a look at the 92  Group budget. There are real savings.  And, above all, the 92 Group budget  strikes that all-important balance of  fairness  and  equity-and  spreads  evenly  the  sacrifices  necessary  to  reduce the deficit, what the American  people are demanding.  DEFICIT REDUCTION  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1985
1080,810,13,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday the President declared war on  terrorism, delivering a swift,  immedi ate, rhetorical attack on evil. He even  went so far as to identify specific na tions,  calling  them  terrible,  terrible  names.  Mr. Speaker, this is the same kind of  swift,  immediate, and deliberate ex cuses that the President has employed  in responding to the Iranian hostage  crisis, in responding to each terrorist  attack against innocent Americans in  Lebanon.  Admittedly  the President's hands  may be tied when American lives are  at stake in dealing with hostages, but  Mr. Reagan's hands are not  tied  in  dealing with  the deficit. The House  has, by its budget resolution, cut the  President's deficit by $56 billion. The  President need not make excuses. He  can take swift, deliberate action and  support reducing his deficit by sup porting the House budget resolution.  SEVEN AMERICANS STILL HELD  HOSTAGE IN LEBANON  <Mr. O'BRIEN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr.  Speaker,  last  Sunday morning, a special Mass was  said at St. Raymond's Cathedral  in  Joliet, IL, to mark the sixth month of  Father Lawrence Martin Jenco's being  held hostage in Lebanon.  Mr. Speaker, the TWA hostage crisis  has come and gone and Father Jenco  and six other Americans are still held  hostage in Lebanon.  The International Committee of the  Red Cross has come and gone to visit  the TWA hostages. The Red Cross has  never been permitted to visit Father  J en co and  the six other Americans  still held hostage in Lebanon.  The American television news crews  have come and gone to cover the TWA  hostages. No  television  news  crews  have  been  permitted  to  interview  Father J enco and the six other Amer cians still held hostage in Lebanon.  Sunday marked  the 180th day of  captivity for Father Lawrence Martin  Jenco.  Sunday was the 478th day of captiv ity for William Buckley.  Sunday was the 425th day of captiv ity for Rev. Benjamin Weir.  Sunday was the 113th day of captiv ity for Terry Anderson.  Sunday was the 41st day of captivity  for David P. Jacobsen.  Sunday was the 27th day of captivity  for Thomas Sutherland.  Sunday marked the 215th day of the  disappearance of Peter Kilburn.  Mr. Speaker, seven Americans are  still being held hostage  in Lebanon.  ",1985

1082,823,13,Mr. BADHAM.,"  I will be happy to  yield  to my  friend,  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. GILMAN].  ",1985
1083,823,13,Mr.  GILMAN.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding and  I thank the gentleman for raising the  issue and for his agreement to with draw the amendment at this time.  I would like to point out to the gen tleman  that the Committee on For eign Affairs did review the proposal as  part of the foreign aid measure in the  subcommittee and while there was not  an extensive hearing on  this  issue,  there was a review by the subcommit tee.  But what I would like to point out is  that it is estimated that over $2 billion  in  this program will be spent with  American firms in helping to develop  and do  the  research and make  the  parts for this aircraft. Over $700 mil lion have already been let in contracts,  and incidentally over $1 million in the  gentleman's own district have been de voted to this aircraft. It is anticipated  that there will be over $2 billion of  this program spent here in the United  States.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1985
1084,823,13,Mr. BADHAM.," I  thank the gentle man for his contribution and I think  such a study, if held, would definitely  point out if and whether, and whether  or not this would be beneficial to our  economy, as well as beneficial to the  Armed Forces of the State of Israel.  I yield back the balance of my time.   ",1985
1085,823,13,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the amendment offered  by the gentleman from California. I  feel that we need to study the effect  of allowing FMS credits  to be spent  outside the United States, a practice  which has only recently begun. At a  time when unemployment in my home  State of West Virginia is the highest  in the country, and has been for over 2  years now,  I  find  it hard to vote to  send U.S.  tax dollars  to any foreign  country to build up their aerospace in dustry when  this would  come  into  direct competition with our own aero space industry. Many American com panies would be affected by the con tinuation of  this practice and I  feel  that it is time the President undertook  a study into the exact effects of this  new  policy  concerning our Foreign  Military Sales Program.  Even  though we  are dealing with  foreign  aid  legislation,  the  issue at  stake here  is American  jobs, and  I  want  to  stress  that  to  the  fullest  extent; it is a question of whether we  as a nation can afford to export jobs  while so many Americans, particularly  West Virginians, are out of work.  I  have spoken out on this floor against  the exporting of our jobs overseas and  I feel strongly that the practice of al lowing our FMS credits to be spent  outside the United States only further  serves to put more Americans out of  work. I am not advocating scrapping  any existing programs;  I am simply  saying  that  these credits should be  spent on developing  these programs  right here at home to the benefit of  those who are paying  the bill-the  American taxpayer.  I commend the gentleman from Cali fornia on his proposal for a study so  that we can see just how many Ameri cans will be put out of work by this  new practice. I urge adoption of this  amendment.e  PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  ",1985

1088,823,13,Mr. BADHAM.," Mr. Chairman, I just  heard  the  comments made,  and  if  Members were not  listening,  I  did  withdraw the amendment.  I now ask unanimous consent again  to withdraw my amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  California?  There was no objection.  ",1985
1089,823,13,Mr.  LEVINE  of  California.," Mr.  Chairman, I move  to strike the last  word.  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gen tleman for raising the issue that he  has, and specifically for withdrawing  this  amendment  in  this  fashion.  I  think that he has raised issues which  he believes are significant, and I think  the manner in which he has elected to  bring this matter to the House's atten tion, specifically by raising it and then  immediately withdrawing it, is helpful  and is particularly helpful within the  time constraints of this debate.  In order not to expand significantly  the time constraints of this debate, I,  as the author of the Lavi amendment  in the subcommittee, both this session  and the last session, would simply like  to make a couple of brief points.  First, last year, as the Members will  recall, this general issue was debated  on the House floor. That amendment  was different  in  that it would have  these  for  funds  stricken  the use of  these purposes.  But I think that most of the issues  that have been raised in the context of  the Lavi discussion were raised at that  time. And the fact that that amend ment was defeated by a vote of 379  against the amendment to 40 in favor  of  the amendment provides  a  very  good sense of the view of the House on  an  extensive  bipartisan  basis with  regard to this issue.  I also think it is important, as the  gentleman  from  New  York  [Mr.  GILMAN]  indicated,  to emphasize the  fact  that  this  issue now has been  heard in the Europe and Middle East  Subcommittee twice. Both the gentle man from New York and I serve on  that subcommittee. This was approved  by the Subcommittee on Europe and  the Middle East in the prior Congress  unanimously, on a bipartisan basis,  and approved again this year by that  subcommittee.  Furthermore, with  regard  to  the  issue of reporting, and with regard to  the issue of making available to all rel evant and interested parties the  im portant information that does go  to  the heart of this question, I think we  should emphasize that ongoing consul tations have been occurring continu ously on this matter between our Gov ernment  and  the Government  of  Israel. It is my understanding, in fact,  from a  telephone conversation I had  just today with the Pentagon that the  Israeli Government has provided our  own Defense Department with exten sive information, most of which I un derstand is classified, but extensive in formation that is in the Pentagon and  which reports on the consultations be tween the Government of Israel and  our Government in Washington, DC,  just last month. These conversations  followed conversations that took place  in Israel between our Government and  the Government of Israel in April. I  understand  that the Israeli Govern ment provided to our Defense Depart ment answers to a series of detailed  questions with regard to the Lavi.  So I  think that with regard to the  issue of cost, with regard to the issue  of performance, with regard to the key  issues that are at hand pertaining to  the use of FMS dollars for the devel opment for  the Lavi  jet fighter, we  have had ample study, we have had  ample  information  available  to our  Government. We have had  informa tion on an ongoing basis between the  two governments.  Therefore,  I  think  that pursuing  this amendment further, bringing it to  a vote would not have been necessary  and I do commend the gentleman for  having withdrawn the amendment.  Let me add several other relevant  points for the RECORD.  is common knowledge  that  the  Lavi Program has created jobs in the  It  ",1985

1091,836,13,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Chair man, we have a very similar situation  in Mozambique; we have a very repres sive Marxist-Leninist government, who  is repressing its people and trying to  expand its sphere of influence, and we  have freedom fighters over there who  want to have free elections and free  institutions, like our friends in Central  America would like to have. I think it  is  inconsistent for us to support the  freedom fighters  in Central America  and to oppose the freedom fighters in  Mozambique. I  think that this labor  leader in the UAW in Anderson, IN,  was  right on  target when he asked  Why?  ",1985
1092,836,13,Mr. SILJANDER., Will  man yield?  ,1985
1093,836,13,Mr. GILMAN., I yield to the gentle man.  ,1985
1094,836,13,Mr. SILJANDER.," I thank the gen tleman from New York for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, it is interesting, the  sudden rise of interest in why the ad ministration does what it wants to do  and why it supports various policies in  the southern Africa region, but I think  there is another subtle reason.  It is because South Africa itself sup ports U.S. military and economic aid  to Mozambique.  I  talked with Mr.  Botha, the Foreign Minister of South  Africa, and he himself was very en couraging to me, as a congressman vis iting his country, that we should in  fact  support Mozambique,  because  from South Africa's point of view, the  Government of South Africa, stabiliz ing Mozambique helps South Africa's  security.  A secondary reason: The administra tion is supporting repeal of the Clark  amendment.  I wonder  if  the gentle man would also support the repeal of  the Clark amendment.  I mentioned  constructive  engage ment. Neither of us support construc tive engagement.  So it seems like some of us support  some of the policies some of the time  but neither of us all of the policies all  the time, and we are not here debat ing, necessarily,  the administration's  policy;  that  is not  the amendment.  The amendment is whether or not this  country, the taxpayers of this Nation,  will give taxpayers dollars to support a  Marxist-Leninist regime that has given  no reason for us to give military aid,  let alone any other type of aid exclud ing emergency food aid;  there is not  one solid reason to do so, and I have  not yet heard a  respectable,  logical  reason.  ",1985
1095,836,13,Mr. GILMAN.,"  I  thank the gentle man for his remarks, and I urge my  colleagues to support the gentleman's  amendment.  0 1520  ",1985
1096,836,13,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that  implicit  in  the  arguments  for  the  amendment of  the gentleman  from  Michigan is  the premise that once a  country or  a  government describes  !tself as Marxist-Leninist, no matter  how it changes its foreign policy direc tions or alliances or tendencies, we the United States  of America-are  bound in by that country's prior label ing of itself, and even if it is in the  best interest of the Government of the  United States of America, we will not  change our position  to  reflect  that  other government's new position.  A number of us had occasion as  members  of  the Subcommittee  on  Africa to visit Mozambique in 1983 and  again in 1985. The changed attitudes  by the Governments of Mozambique  and of the United States toward each  other were  diametric,  a  180-degree  turn. The reason that the Reagan ad ministration is asking for this kind of  help is because they have found that  by action, not just rhetoric, the Gov ernment  of Mozambique  has  been  helpful in attempting to resolve  the  major problems in the southern area  of Africa. They have used their best  efforts in an attempt to achieve a reso lution of outstanding problems con cerning Angola, Namibia, and South  Africa.  Now,  it seems  to me  that  if  the  Reagan administration feels that it is  helpful  to provide  the Mozambique  Government some breathing room at  this point in order to allow it to con tinue  to move  in our direction, we  ought to be applauding and support ing the administration for doing that.  For those who may be familiar with  the situation, Mozambique is rent by  not just the drought and the famine  and the starvation that is going on,  but by a civil war with no ideological  convictions. It is not a matter of ""free dom fighters"" against the Government  of Mozambique. It is, rather a number  of disparate groups, some of whom are  outright bandits, some of whom were  set up by the Rhodesian Government,  some of whom are now being support ed  by  some  elements  from South  Africa, not necessarily  the Govern ment of South Africa, and some of  whom are funded by factions of the  Portuguese colonialists who lost their  economic power when the revolution  occurred.  Our own people in the Government  of the United States, tell us that if the  Government  of Mozambique  fell,  those groups overturning it, would be  incapable  of  governing  and  there  would be absolute chaos. It is to the  interest of  the Government of  the  United States to help to stabilize the  situation in Mozambique. It seems to  me that a $3.5 million military, non lethal assistance program, as well as  some  training for their officers,  is a  small price to pay on the road toward  weaning  a Marxist-Leninist  govern ment  away  from  the  direction  in  which they were headed. So I would  hope that in following the good sense  of the Reagan administration, in rec ognizing the realities of that situation,  that we would defeat the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Michi gan.

1098,836,13,Mr. WEISS.," I yield to the gentleman  from Michigan.  ~.rr. WOLPE. I thank the gentleman  for yielding, and I wish to simply com mend the gentleman on his statement.  The administration has recognized, in  the case of Mozambique, in direct re sponse to my colleague, the gentleman  from Michigan, that we do have an in terest  in encouraging  this very dra matic  movement  by  Mozambique  toward a nonaligned posture, toward a  closer political, economic, and military  relationship with the West.  The  reason  for allowing  the very  modest amount of military assistance  to go forward  is very simple. It is a  signal to the Mozambicans that they  do not have to be dependent upon the  Soviets to protect their legitimate se curity interests. It is also a signal to  the South Africans that we take seri ously the Nkomati accord and expect  the South Africans to do whatever is  necessary to make certain that logisti cal support does not continue to flow  to that dissident movement.  I noticed that some of my colleagues  have referred to the MNR as freedom  fighters. Let it be very clearly under stood that this is a movement that was  started by people committed  to  the  preservation of white minority rule in  South Africa and  indeed earlier  in  Rhodesia. And it continues to be sup ported logistically and financially by  people committed to the preservation  of apartheid and white minority rule  in South Africa.  I submit that that is hardly the kind  of freedom fighter with whom Ameri cans want to be identified.  The CHAIRMAN.

1101,849,13,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chair man,  I move  to strike  the requisite  number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the Solarz-Broomfield substitute and  in opposition  to  the Leach amend ment.  The United States has a keen inter est in the situation in Cambodia, Mr.  Chairman. On the one hand, we have  a moral responsibility to assist in ef forts to bring about the removal of the  Vietnamese forces from that war torn  battered nation. On the other hand,  we have a responsibility to insure that  should the Vietnamese forces current ly strangling freedom in Cambodia be  expelled or agree to a negotiated set tlement which eliminates or reduces  their presence,  that  the murderous  Pol Pot forces, whose genocidal wave  of terror simply boggles the mind, do  not return to power.  At  present,  the  non-Communist  forces are fighting an uphill struggle.  They are inadequately equipped, espe cially in the face of a massive Viet namese military presence along  the  Thai-Cambodian border. But certainly  these courageous freedom fighters are  not short on determination to rid their  country of the Vietnamese oppressors.  The Congress can and should be en thusiastic about assisting  these non Communist forces in their struggle.  Let me just briefly review what the  administration has to say about this  provision.  [Wel welcome      the provision as an  important signal  to Hanoi regarding con gressional and public attitudes toward Vietnam's illegal occupation of Cambodia and  the threat it poses to its other neighbors.  The ASEAN foreign ministers have  strongly expressed  their support for  the provision,  in addition, and have  urged its passage. The United States,  which has thus far followed ASEAN's  lead on the Cambodian issue, should  continue this policy, as Vietnam's illic it invasion and occupation most direct ly affects their security. Thailand, for  example, has weathered and repelled  numerous Vietnamese incursions into  Thai territory. We must stand by our  Thai friends, whose courage also de serves our praise.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to sup port the substitute. I also understand  and appreciate the comments and con cerns of my colleague from Iowa, ",1985

Make no mistake-$5 mil lion is not going to force the Vietnam ese out of Cambodia; it will, however,  send a very clear and strong signal to  our non-Communist friends struggling  in Southeast Asia that their cause is  also our own, and that their fight for  freedom is ours as well. The non-Com munist freedom fighters of Cambodia  are worthy of U.S. support, and I urge  my colleagues  to oppose  the Leach  amendment and vote for  the substi tute.  ",1985

1105,849,13,Mr. GEJDENSON., I would just like  to point out for my friend and others  who  are  in  support of  the Solarz  amendment  that  the Leach amend ment deals with assistance to the non Communist  forces  in Cambodia pre cisely in the way that we provide as sistance to the Afghan rebels in hu manitarian assistance.  It is not  the  Solarz  language but  the Leach  lan guage that mirrors how we deal with  the two situations.  ,1985

1107,849,13,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to raise some  questions, to clarify in my own mind  some of the questions of fact involved  in these issues between the two pro posed amendments, that is the amend ment and the substitute thereto.  As I understand it, this amendment  does not arise from any particular ad ministration request for legislation. I  would yield  to any member of  the  committee.  thank the  I  If  ",1985
1108,849,13,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Chairman,  the  gentleman's point is well taken. It does  not respond to a specific administra tion request, although the adminstra tion has indicated its support for the  amendment on the grounds that it be lieves that it would serve a useful pur pose for the Congress to provide the  administration with the flexibility and  the authority  the amendment does  give them to give the non-Communist  resistance forces either economic and  humanitarian aid or military assist ance or some combination of both, de pending on the circumstance.  0 1650  ",1985
1109,849,13,Mr. GONZALEZ.," I assume from that  that the administration took no initia tive to seek this kind of legislation at  this time. But, on a interrogatory re quest on the part of the committee,  they were asked to give an opinion on  what it was, if they had their druth ers, they would prefer.  ",1985
1110,849,13,Mr.  SOLARZ.,"  the  gentleman  would yield further, some of the other  Members have said during the course  of debate that we never had any hear ings on this, the truth is we did have  an exhaustive hearing in executive ses sion with  representatives of several  different agencies of the Government  that provided  a  record which  any  Member of the House is free to inspect  at their leisure at this issue.  Now,  it  is my  judgment  that  the  main  reason  the administration did  not publicly or privately request this  kind of authority when the foreign aid  bill was sent up to the Congress was  largely  because  they  believed  that  there would not be sufficient support  for it on the Hill. That is why, when  the amendment was originally offered  in the committee, the administration  indicated that it was not in favor of it.  When  the Subcommittee on Asian  and Pacific Affairs where the amend ment originated  supported  it by  a  margin of more than 2 to 1; when the  Foreign Affairs Committee as a whole  supported it by more than a margin of  2 to 1; when the Senate voted for it on  a voice vote with every Senator in the  debate speaking in favor of the bill,  the administration came to the conclu sion  that there was  indeed a broad  basis for bipartisan support for  this  kind of initiative and now they have  publicly endorsed it.  ",1985
1111,849,13,Mr. GONZALEZ.," But what puzzles  me is that if the administration took  no initiative, but on the other hand, at  the outset of  the debate  today on  these  amendments,  the  gentleman  from Indiana said that there was a  highly confidential source of informa tion,  I presume CIA, and that that  would presumably be  the basis  for  such things as $5 million  instead of  some other figure, and it seems to me  that that is administration source in formation.

1112,862,13,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, as we  commence debate today on the very  important foreign aid bill let us con sider for a moment an article in last  Saturday's Washington Post,  and  I  read: ""As U.N. Women's Decade Ends  African Wives Still Exploited, Men  Demand Pregnancies as Proof of Their  Virility.""  As we begin debate on this measure,  Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of  women in sub-Saharan Africa leading  lives of quiet desperation. Whatever  family planning services are available  to  them sometimes are miles away.  They cannot afford the cost of trans port and, in any event, their husbands  tend  to oppose  family planning be cause  from  a  traditional standpoint  they believe that large families are el oquent testimony to their virility.  So when we  talk  about UNFP A,  IPPF, the World Bank, the regional  development banks and our own AID  program, we have to remember that  the decisionmaking  that goes on  in  each of these African countries is an  absolutely  indispensable precondition  to making all the money, all the caring  and all the resources that the world  donor community is lavishing on sub Saharan Africa work successfully.  The African countries have to make  some hard decisions on improving the  status of women. They have got  to  make decisions to offer women equal  access to education, to jobs, to credit,  to increasing the age of marriage, lib erating  their women,  and making  women equal partners in life.  The  international  family planning  organizations must work together and  use all of their powers of persuasion to  encourage African chiefs of state to  make fundamental changes in society.  Family planning alone is not enough.  Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba  was a pioneer in the movement to im prove the status of women. In the late  1950's, Bourguiba used his office and  the media to educate his country on  the need to reduce population growth.  Bourguiba told his people that Tuni sia was a small, resource-poor country.  He also pointed out that men confused  virility with the number of children  they had and he sought  to change  male viewpoints on family life.  He urged men to reduce the number  of children  they fathered and ""Put  education  in  the head,  love  in  the  heart, food in the stomach, and shoes  on the feet."" Only then, he said, would  someone be a real man.  When other African nations follow  Bourguiba's lead then the contracep tive technology and the family plan ning clinics which the developed world  is offering  to  them will have some  impact and will be of assistance in im proving the quality of life in sub-Saha ran Africa, that most beleaguered of  all continents on Earth.

1114,875,13,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, for  several days now, I have delivered to  the floor of the Senate what I call my  myth of the day.  My 1Oth myth of the day has been a  product more of expectation than a  Presidential or administration state ment. When  James Watt  left  the  Reagan administration as Secretary of  the Interior, Americans who put a pri ority on  the environment heaved a  mass sigh of relief. The general public  still persisted in the feeling that we  could  expect  to breathe  clean  air,  drink pure water, and  that the Na tion's marvelous environmental legacy  was home  free. Unfortunately,  that  general belief is a myth. The environ ment suffers the same problems of ex ploitation  and  neglect  it  suffered  under Watt. Consider:  First,  the Reagan  administration  still has no acid rain program, prefer ing  unlimited  ""further  study""  to  taking action. Meanwhile our  lakes  and forests continue  to be damaged  and recent scientific studies show the  problem is spreading to new geograph ic areas like Far West.  Second, in first 5 years of Superfund  Program the Federal Government to tally cleaned up  just a handful of  sites-six-out of  the  thousands  of  dangerous,  abandoned,  hazardous  waste dumps nationwide.  Third, EPA managed  to  reregister  just 1 percent of all pesticides stand ards. Even worse the vast majority of  older pesticides on  the market are  missing vital test data for determining  whether they cause cancer, birth de fects or mutations.  Fourth, the Interior Department has  continued implementing Watt's policy  of weakening  the  landmark Alaska  Lands Act  including his attacks on  Alaskan national parks and refuges.  Fifth, the Surface Mining Program  is still not enforced. The Interior De partment is owed hundreds of millions  in  uncollected  fines  from  scofflaw  mining companies.  Sixth, Interior is still implementing  Watt's onshore oil  and gas  leasing  policies which  threaten wildlife and  cheat taxpayers out of a fair rate of  return for our resources.  Seventh,  despite  some  cosmetic  changes in Watt's controversial Coal  Leasing Program, Interior still clings  to his giveaway policies which encour age speculation.  Eighth,  Interior  has  not  backed  down  from  Watt's  controversial  areawide mass leasing of offshore oil  and gas lands.  CORPS OF ENGINEERS WIN  JULY FLEECE  ",1985

1116,914,13,Mr.  HATCH.," Madam  President,  during negotiations in the 98th Con gress relative to the scienter or state  of mind requirements, there was a dis crepancy between what the parties un derstood the term ""knowing"" to mean.  Senator McCLURE, who deserves great  credit for his contributions to this leg islation, expressed his concern  that  some courts have diluted ""knowing"" to  mean ""belief"" or ""reckless disregard""  rather than ""actual cognizance."" The  simple  carelessness  language  was  added to the bill to clarify that the  holding and rationale of those cases  would not apply to the offenses cov ered by  this bill. Unfortunately, at tempting to set aside  those cases by  the addition of the simple carelessness  language  creates needless  confusion  and contradictions inS. 49. According ly, this objective is more properly han dled by the legislative history of the  report to accompany S. 914 from the  98th Congress, which is the authorita tive source for the intent of the Judici ary Committee, and the clear under standing of  the manager  and  sup poters of this bill that these cases are  not to be applied as a guide in ascerU.S.  taining  the meaning  of  the  term  ""knowingly."" In voting or speaking on  any aspect of this bill's revisions con cerning mens rea, we intend to exclude  the following cases from any consider ation of  the meaning of  the  term  ""knowingly;"" U.S.  v. Graves, 394 F.  Sup. 429 <W.O. Penn. 1975> aff'd, 554  F.  2d  65  <3rd Cir.  1977);  v.  Thomas, 484 F. 2d 909 <6th Cir. 1973)  cert. denied 414 U.S. 912 0973>; U.S. v.  Werner, 160 F. 2d 438 0947>; and in  addition,  any  other  case  or  cases  which can be construed similarly  to  hold what these cases have been con strued to hold.  With this understanding, however, I  must urge the Senate to comply with  its earlier time agreement and delete  the ""simple carelessness"" language.  The ambiguity and confusion inher ent in the term ""simple carelessness""  might only be partially overcome by  extensive legislative history explaining  the narrow purpose of this terminolo gy. It seems far preferable to devote  that  legislative history  to Congress'  intent that the cases I have mentioned  above not be applied to offenses occur ring under this act. This will avoid ex tensive confusion, yet accomplish our  objective just as certainly as devoting  legislative history  to explanation of  the meaning of  the  term ""careless ness.""  Madam President, I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  a letter concerning this question.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,  Washington, DC, July 5, 1985.  DEAR SENATOR HATCH: This responds  to  your request for the Administration's posi tion on the so-called ""simple carelessness""  defense inS. 49, ""A Bill to protect firearms  owners' constitutional rights, civil liberties,  and rights to privacy.""  The provision in question, which appears  on page 21 of the bill, lines 20 through 22,  specifically states, ""That no person shall be  prosecuted under this subsection where the  conduct of such person involves simple care lessness."" The apparent purpose of the pro vision  is  to preclude the prosecution and  conviction of person for an act of simple  carelessness constituting a  technical viola tion of the Gun Control Act, e.g., federally  licensed firearms dealers who inadvertently  violate the recordkeeping requirements of  the Act  in  some minor or  insignificant  aspect.  The Administration believes that the de fense is unnecessary inasmuch as other pro visions of the bill would require proof of an  accused's knowledge or intent in any pros ecution under the Gun Control Act. Fur thermore, the bill would amend 18 U.S.C.  Section 924(a) to require as an element of  proof that certain offenses were ""knowing ly"" committed on the accused's part, while  the  remaining  offenses were  committed  ""willfully"". For example, in a prosecution of  a licensed dealer for the felony of falsifying  records of firearms transactions required to  be maintained by the dealer, the Govern ment would have  to  establish  that  the  ",1985
1117,927,13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I rise in  strong opposition to this legislation in  its present form. While I have many  concerns with  the  bill  before  the  Senate today, I believe it is still, possi ble, with the approval of certain cru cial amendments, to enact a responsi ble bill.  This legislation, as proposed, tu.ns  back the clock of Federal protection  against handgun crime in seeking to  overturn key provisions of the modest  Gun Control Act of 1968, as passed in  the wake  of  the  assassinations  of  Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert  F. Kennedy.  This measure would  weaken our national firearms laws and  effectively take, as the National Rifle  Association has called  it, ""the first  step  toward repealing the 1968 Gun  Control Act.""  The Gun Control Act of 1968 was in tended to keep handguns out of the  wrong hands-the  felon,  the minor,  the unlawful drug user, the mental in competent-and  to  punish  harshly  those who use handguns in crime. The  centerpiece of the act is the broad pro hibition  of  interstate  commerce  in  firearms by unlicensed, private citi zens. The legislation we consider here  today eliminates that prohibition, al lowing once again easy mail access to  guns by criminals and would-be assas sins.  My father, the late Senator Thomas  Dodd, dedicated much of his Senate  service to putting an end to such easy  availability of firearms  to criminals.  He was chairman of the Senate's Juve nile  Delinquency  Subcommittee,  where he conducted numerous hear ings in the 1960's on the unrestricted  availability of firearms. My father was  astounded by what he discovered. Ba zookas, handguns, and an assortment  of automatic weapons were on display  in his subcommittee-the undeniable  and frightening evidence of the ease  with which these lethal weapons could  be acquired-at times even by the chil dren of committee staff.  My father led an uphill and often times exasperating battle to move leg islation aimed at keeping guns out of  the hands of criminals  through  the  full committee and onto the Senate  floor. He never lost faith, and I am  proud to say, remained a driving force  behind final passage of the Gun Con trol Act of 1968. He refused to believe  that the gun runners, the hoodlums,  the crackpots, and the self-styled vigi lantes were more powerful than the  American people. My father believed  in his own words, that ""the American  people will not forget  the assassina tion of President Kennedy with  a  weapon fraudulently obtained through  the mails, nor could they forget the  other  needless  tragedies  that  they  read about every day.""  Mr. President,  I  refuse  to believe  that our national nightmare over the  assassination of President Kennedy  has been forgotten. I believe a passage  from Carl Bakal's book, ""The Right to  Bear Arms,"" is telling:  Then came the terrible tragedy in Dallas.  In the spa~e of a few seconds, Lee Harvey  Oswald-with a cheap foreign surplus mili tary rifle, purchased under a phony name  from Klein's Sporting Goods,  a Chicago  mail-order house-had murdered the Presi dent. On the rifle was a telescopic gunsight  which had originated from another mail order house, Weapons, Inc., of Los Angeles.  Less than an hour later, Oswald had killed  police officer J. D. Tipitt with a .38 caliber  revolver purchased from still another mail order house, Seaport Traders, also of Los  Angeles.  It would be disconcerting,  indeed,  Mr. President, for this body to repeal  the very provision whose purpose is to  prevent such tragedy.  Another concern I have with  this  bill is that it was placed directly on  the Senate Calendar, by-passing  the  careful scrutiny of the Senate Judici ary Committee. I believe it was a mis take to reintroduce the bill this year  without the compromises that pains takingly were worked out by the Judi ciary Committee last year to prohibit  the  interstate  sale  of  ""snubbies"" handguns with  barrel  lengths  less  than 3 inches. It has been well docu mented that 11 of 15 handguns most  often  used  in  the  commission  of  murder,  armed  robbery,  and other  street crimes had snub-nosed barrels  of 2.5  inches or less. Criminals favor  concealability. Short barrels mean in accuracy at anything beyond point  blank range. They should therefore be  of little interest to legitimate hunters,  hobbyists, and target-shooters.  I also would have liked to have seen  a waiting period included in this bill, a  provision adopted by the Senate Judi ciary Committee in the 98th Congress.  The Gun Control Act of 1968, while  setting forth categories of persons to  whom firearms may not be sold, does  not  require verification of  the pur chasers eligibility. A person purchas ing a firearm from a federally licensed  dealer is only required to sign a form  on which he affirms by sworn state ment that he is not proscribed from  purchasing a  firearm. As one might  expect, this ""honor system"" of verifi cation has done little to prevent pro",1985
1118,953,13,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, 6 years  ago,  the National Firearms Owners  Protection Act was first introduced by  Senator McCLURE. Thanks  in  large  part to his tireless efforts on behalf of  the  legislation,  the Senate is  finally  passing  this  crucial  bill.  Senators  HATCH and THURMOND have also COn tributed significantly over the years to  building  the  consensus  needed  to  secure final passage. Law-abiding gun owners,  dealers,  and manufacturers  throughout  the  country  owe  these  Senators a debt of gratitude for work ing so hard on their behalf to correct  the abuses that have occurred under  the 1968 Gun Control Act.  As Senator McCLURE stated on the  Senate floor when he first introduced  his bill on October 5, 1979: ""The legis lation        is designed  to carefully  correct a series of abuses without fun damentally altering the law which had  led to those abuses."" As we proceed to  a  final vote on this  legislation,  it is  well to keep those last few words or  Senator McCLURE  in mind. This bill  does not permit everything from mail order gun sales  to street-corner ven dors peddling Saturday night specials  as some have implied. The truth is this  bill maintains the integrity of the 1968  act as it applies to illegal gun manu facture, sales, and purchases. What it  will do  is put an end to unfair and  unjust enforcement practices, border ing, at times, on harrassment, under taken  against  law-abiding  citizens  which,  if  anything,  have  diverted  scarce  law  enforcement  resources  away from  tracking down and pros ecuting the true criminals. It is sound  legislation and I am pleased to have  played a role in securing its passage as  Senate majority leader.  Mr. President, though we may dis agree on many of the issues, I would  also like to thank Senators KENNEDY  and METZENBAUM for cooperating with  us in proceeding to and passing this  legislation in an orderly way. I would  also like to thank Senator BIDEN for  his help in working out the time agree ment.  Finally, I would like to thank all the  staff who have worked on this bill in cluding Mike Hammond and Nancy  Norell with Senator McCLURE; Randy  Rader with Senator HATcH; Steve Dil lingham  with  Senator  THURMOND;  Jerry Tinker with Senator KENNEDY;  Scott Green with Senator BIDEN; and  Eddie Correia with Senator METZ ENBAUM.

1119,953,13,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, when  Congress enacted the Gun Control Act  of 1968, its intent was to reduce vio lent crime, not to encourage prosecu tions for inadvertent infractions of the  intricate, complex, and detailed com plexities of the act. If we are serious  about fighting violent crime, we will  enact  this  bill  swiftly.  This  bill  strengthens penalties against violent  offenses, makes  it a  crime  for any  person-not just a dealer to sell a gun  knowingly  to a  felon-and  in other  ways focuses our scarce law enforce ment resources on violent offenses.  As the law now stands, it lacks a def inition for ""engaging in the business""  which allows law-abiding citizens to be  convicted of a felony for selling one or  two  guns  inherited  from  a  family  member. It has no mens rea, state of  mind, requirements for many offenses,  which allows persons to be convicted  of a felony on the same basis as a traf fic ticket.  We need to redirect our firearms en forcement efforts away from technical  recordkeeping violations and  toward  violent crime. This bill accomplishes  that and deserves our support.  I  ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the REcoRD an article from  the Wall Street Journal of Tuesday,  July 9, 1985, regarding this subject.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, July 9,  1985]  ZEALOUS ENFORCERS TRIGGER  RECONSIDERATION OF GUN LAW  <By David T. Hardy)  The Senate is expected to take up this  week the so-called Volkmer-McClure Bill. It  represents six years of effort to reform the  1968 Gun Control Act, the primary federal  law affecting our 200,000 licensed firearms  dealers and 80 million firearms owners and  collectors. Hastily drafted at a time of na tional tumult, the GCA was aimed at pre venting felons and other unpleasant sorts  from owning guns. Along  the way  it re quired persons ""engaged in the business"" of  dealing in guns to obtain a license, required  such dealers to maintain records of sales,  and imposed felony sanctions, forfeiture of  firearms and other sanctions on violators.  Enforcement  agencies,  like most  orga nisms, seek to grow. Over the dozen years  following enactment, the one charged under  the GCA grew from an IRS subunit, with  214 agents, to a full Treasury bureau-Alco hol,  Tobacco  and  Firearms-with  1,200  agents on gun-related duties. Such explosive  growth  required especially  impressive  re sults. Fortunately for the bureau, the GCA  opened the door to easy cases against unsu specting person: With strict liability, even  the most trivial and unintentional misstep  would do.  Agents and informants had but to make a  few purchases-all legal-from a collector,  then charge him with having ""engaged in  the business"" of gun dealing without a  li cense. For variation, any technical record keeping error could be inflated into a felony  count. The prize for originality, however,  went to the agents who located persons who  ",1985

1123,966,13,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, I  just  want to comment briefly, if I may, on  the news coming out of  the White  House meeting  this  afternoon  that  cuts in Social Security that have been  proposed are no longer on the table  for negotiation in the effort to reduce  the Federal budget. That is wonderful  news for the retirees and senior citi zens in this country.  There has been no justification for  trying to cut the cost-of-living adjust ments for senior citizens. The Social  Security Trust Fund is in sound finan cial shape. A promise was made in the  last election by the President, when he  was running, that there would be no  cuts  in Social Security. And so  the  news  that  the Social Security pro posed cuts are off the table  is very  good news.  All of those who have been involved  in the fight on the Senate side here on  this side of  the aisle,  the minority  leader and others on the Budget Com mittee with myself who have fought  very hard to protect Social Security,  feel some very considerable sense of  victory tonight with that news.  I hope now we can move on and find  a package solution to the budget defi cit  problem,  and  hopefully  before  David Stockman leaves office. I think  time is short for us to come up with a  deficit reduction package. If it should  continue to drift along until he leaves  and a new person has to be brought in  as  Director  of Management  and  Budget, I  think it will make the job  more difficult.  So I hope now that we could move  with a new sense of urgency, now that  Social Security has been set  to  the  side, to deal with the remaining issues,  come up with the best package we can,  reduce the deficit as much as possible  and reach that compromise, report it  out, bring it back to the House and  Senate and try to have that matter re solved before we  leave early  in  the  month of August. I think it is feasible  to do that if we make that our No. 1  priority, and I hope that we would.  ",1985
1124,966,13,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  would not have even been here to have  heard the news of what is on and off  the table at the budget conference had  it not been an accident of my being  here. But  from what  I  understand,  just  so we  will  have  the  record  straight, TIP O'NEILL said it is off the  table, JIM WRIGHT has said it is off the  table, and the distinguished minority  leader of  the U.S. Senate, RoBERT  BYRD, of West Virginia, said it is off  the table. I think that is the record. In  the case of one of the three,  it has  been off the table from the beginning.  In the case of two from the House, it  was maybe on the table until a couple  of weeks ago, but it has been off since  then.  So while my friend from Michigan  thinks  there  is  rather some explicit  news, I do not think it is any different  than where we were a couple of weeks  ago in the case of two of those that he  speaks for, and in the case of another  it is no different than we have had for  2 or 3 months.  We are still in the process of trying  to get a budget. If we are going to take  $33 billion off the table, we have got  to find $33 billion somewhere else. If  we take just Social Security-it is $21  billion-we have  to  find $21  billion  somewhere else. So I think we are still  in that position. I do not think things  have changed.  ",1985
1125,966,13,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, let me  just respond to the Senator from New  Mexico and say that my understand ing of the report I received from the  White House meeting was that indeed  the three individuals that he cited said  it was off  the  table, but also  that  David SfOckman then said obviously it  was off the table, and then there was  no dissent  to  that view,  I am  told,  from the President or from the major ity leader or anybody else.  So if there is something that some body can add that would indicate that  that is not the case, it would be well to  have it on the record. But the report  that I have been given is that that is  what took place at the meeting.  ",1985
1126,966,13,Mr. DOMENICI.," Let me just say to  my friend from Michigan, when you  are going  to put something on  the  record you have to know what you are  talking about and  since  I was not  there and I have heard three or four  different explanations, I cannot clari fy the record.  I just heard the distinguished major ity leader, who was there, say it was  still on the table; that we had to find  the savings for it and the House had  no way  to give us  the savings,  that  they had no offer of how you would  get  the  savings  that were  in  this  budget and, therefore, it was still on  the table.  David Stockman is not available.  I  tried to call him a while ago  to ask  him about his retirement and he is en  route home, so I cannot confer with  him.  I do not care to bother the President  about a private meeting he had, so I  cannot clarify the record.  All I know is when I go  to confer ence tomorrow we will see what the  House has to offer and whatever they  would like to take off the table I am  anxiously awaiting to see what they  ",1985

1130,1005,13,Mr. DYMALLY.," Mr. Speaker, I re cently testified before the Subcommit tee on Postsecondary Education  re garding H.R. 2557. I wish to share my  testimony with  the Members of  the  House.  The testimony follows:  H.R. 2557  Mr. Chairman, distinguished colleagues of  the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa tion. I appear before you in support of H.R.  2557, a piece of legislation which I  intro duced, and which I hope will be included in  the Higher Education Act of 1985. The uni versity-high school partnership bill has the  capability of making significant impacts on  the quality of education which will be af forded to very special groups of nontradi tional students-the educationally disadvan taged, potential dropouts, pregnant adoles cents and teen parents, and the gifted and  talented students of this great and prosper ous nation of ours.  The Honorable Mario Biaggi, the distin guished gentleman from the 19th Congres sional District of New York, expressed ex tremely cogent remarks on the topic of non traditional students  in a  July 3rd article  which  appeared  in  ""The Chronicle  of  Higher Education."" Discussing his personal  education experience, Mr. Biaggi stated, ""In  some ways, I think maybe there's a greater  reason to support them <nontraditional stu dents> than the traditional."" And, while the  bulk of his text was geared to the adult stu dent, his logic for support of the nontradi tional student appropriately applies to large  numbers of special students for whom this  legislation was created.  The university-high  school partnership  bill will give support to partnerships by pro viding grants to institutions of higher edu cation and  local education agencies  that  have agreements to develop activities which  will enable secondary students to improve  their academic skills, to increase their op portunities to continue education after high  school, and to improve their prospects for  employment after high school. Businesses,  labor  organizations,  professional  associa tions,  community-based  organizations  or  public or private associations or agencies  may also sign onto the partnership agree ment.  The phenomenon of dropouts  (persons  who are not enrolled  in school and who  have not graduated from high school or re ceived the G.E.D. certificate> from our edu cational systems  is not a new one, and,  indeed, it is one which the Federal Govern ment at one time provided financial assist ance to a small number of school districts  for the purpose of preventing students from  dropping out of high school.  Today, however, Title VIII of the Elemen tary and Secondary Education Act  is no  longer authorized and some 16,000 school  districts of our Nation are faced with a 25  percent dropout rate for all students ninth  through 12th grade.  In its heyday <1969-1976> the Elementary  and S.econdary Education Amendments of  1967 <Public Law 90-247> was authorized to  make grants available to local educational  agencies for demonstration projects which  18277  were designed to prevent high school drop outs. These programs were located in rural  and urban areas which had a high percent age of children: ( 1 > from low income fami lies, and <2> that did not complete elementa ry or  secondary  schooling. The projects  were based on an analysis of why students  were dropping out and had to be approved  by the State Education Agency. Appropria tions  ranged  from $30,000,000  in 1969  to  $33,000,000 in 1976.  Title VIII-the dropout prevention pro gram-was authorized under section 807 of  the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act. For fiscal years 1969 and 1970, Con gress  appropriated  $5,000,000  annually.  These funds supported 10 projects. In 1971,  the  appropriation  was  increased  to  $10,000,000 and a  total of 19 projects was  supported.  The Title VIII projects followed many dif ferent strategies to reduce the dropout rate.  Some organized alternative schools,  learn ing centers and began work-study programs.  Others offered after-school programs and  summer camps. Still others established spe cial academic programs,  individualized  in struction, reading labs, community liaison  assistance, and teacher-student ""buddy"" sys tems.  However, none of these programs attempt ed to merge several approaches, and as a  result, none sought the goal of the universi ty-high school partnership bill-which is to  merge successful concepts and approaches  onto a total pattern of addressing the drop out rate.  A  recent  report by President Reagan's  Commission on Industrial Competitiveness  <A 30 member panel composed of business  leaders,  labor  leaders,  and  educators>  stressed two vital and extremely significant  points about our youth:  1. That the high school dropout rate in  our secondary schools is contributing to the  development of a growing, permanent un derclass in our society. Twenty-six percent  of all students enrolled in school dropout.  At  this  rate, our Nation  is producing  in  excess of 1 million dropouts annually. In ad dition, the dropout rate among minorities is  substantially higher-40 percent for black  Americans and 43  percent  for Hispanics.  One out of three of all American Indians  and Alaskan Natives  leaves school before  graduating.  2. New approaches are required to address  the problem of school dropouts and stem  this loss of human resources. National at tention must be focused on the severity of  the problem, and if the dropout rate contin ues to accelerate, part of an entire genera tion could be lost to the productive process es of creating workers for and contributors  to this society.  The overriding  recommendation of  the  Commission was for a national partnership  to be established between the Federal Gov ernment and the private sector to address  the dropout problem. The purpose of this  partnership would be to coordinate special  services in the school setting, and to give in tensive help to those students most at risk.  This legislation, the university-high school  partnership bill, specifically addresses this  recommendation and goes a step further by  providing an avenue of totally coordinated  educational services for high school drop outs which could be offered in a variety of  settings all of which would be academic.  In addition,  the university-high  school  partnership bill is based on a provision of  the children's survival bill <S. 1237), a com prehensive blueprint for Federal investment  ",1985
1131,1018,13,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  management of our public lands and  reservations  is a  sacred  trust which  our Government must implement with  the utmost care and good conscience.  We have an obligation to nature and  to our children and grandchildren that  we do all that we can to preserve the  gentle balance of nature and take the  least intrusive action whenever man's  interests runs up against the balance  of nature.  I have great concern that the Feder al Government may have gone too far  recently in dealing with nature and in  the process destroyed that gentle bal ance.  Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the  Crane Reservation  in  Ipswich, MA.  This  reservation  is managed by  the  Department of the Interior. Recently,  the Fish and Wildlife Management  Office decided that deer had become  too plentiful  in  this area. The deer  had become too plentiful because man  has disrupted the natural habitat and  balance of nature. And because man  has caused that disruption, then man  has an obligation to correct that im balance in the least intrusive manner  possible.  Unfortunately,  the Office of Fish  and Wildlife Management  did  not  follow  this  principle.  Instead,  the  office chose to bring in a rifle sharp shooter to kill the deer on Crane Res ervation. This action was taken despite  protests by local citizens who thought  that the action was extreme. Further more,  the sharpshooter was enlisted  and the possibility of relocating the  deer was not explored adequately.  I raise this example of the slaughter  of deer on Crane Reservation to call  the attention of my colleagues to the  serious  responsibility  we  hold  to  manage  our  natural  resources.  In  order  to survive on  this planet, we  must coexist with nature, not rule it  and subject it to our every whim. Man  will  intrude on  the parameters of  nature;  that  is  to be expected. But  when we do so, there must be a com mitment to manage the resources in a  careful and compassionate manner.  In nature, we cannot rebuild  that  which we destroy. This principle must  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  guide all our actions. I regret to report  that this principle was violated on the  Crane Reservation in Ipswich, MA.e  DAN CRYSTAL, CIVIL  LIBERTARIAN  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 9, 1985  e ",1985
1132,1018,13,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, for as  long as I have known him-and that  has been many years-Dan Crystal of  New Jersey has been an active and  tireless defender of civil liberties and  advocate for human rights. In recent  years, he has become an equally active  and tireless promoter of world peace,  serving as publicity chairman of Law yers for Nuclear Arms Control.  Dan was  recently honored by  the  Essex County branch of the National  Alliance Against Racist and Political  Repression  for his devotion  to  the  struggle  for  progressive  ideals  and  policies. Dan richly deserves this rec ognition,  and  I  applaud  the Essex  County branch of NAARPR for giving  Dan this award. Despite his many ac tivities, Dan finds  time  to write for,  and serve as associate editor of the Re porter, a publication of  the Passaic  County Bar Association. One of his  recent contributions to that publica tion  is a whimsical account of  this  year's Gridiron Dinner, which I am in serting at this point in the RECORD so  that my colleagues will have an oppor tunity to read and enjoy it.  GRIDIRON MADNESS  <By Daniel Crystal>  It comes on finally  to be spring, as my  good friend Damon Runyon, God rest his  soul, might have said, and I start getting vi sions of the magnolia trees flowering along  the Hackensack River which most certainly  ain't the purest stream in the world but  then I served in the Occupation Forces in  Europe after World War II and I can tell  you that the Beautiful Blue Danube ought  to be called the Big Muddy.  So spring fever hits me real bad, and I  start thinking about the Jersey Generals,  the New York Giants and the New York  Jets all of which teams play on different oc casions on the gridiron in Giant's Stadium  in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and a cab  from midtown will take you there in no time  along Route 3 which also passed Secaucus  which used to have the pig farms and what  with the scent of magnolias and of hogs get ting all mixed up in my memory and think ing of the Secaucus pig farms makes me  think also of the stables at the Meadow lands where I have often been given valua ble tips by the stable hands and those tips  can be very welcome indeed when the nags  start running and it's time to lay your bets  on which nag will wear the roses in the win ner's circle. And so, what with wondering  how good Phil Simms' arm will be  this  season in the NFL and how well Doug Flutie  is learning his signals with the Jersey Gen erals, I hop a cab to the Meadowlands and  have a good time exchanging greetings with  one and all and picking up whatever inside  July 9, 1985  information I can to have a  little edge in  laying my bets on football and basketball  and on the nags.  So after this welcome saying of hello and  how are you to my good friends and buddies  at the Meadowlands, I drop in at the boat  called  the Aratusa Supper Club,  that  is  moored there on the banks of the good old  Hackensack River right there in Secaucus,  New Jersey, on the Meadowlands Parkway,  to have a juicy steak and some chilled ale,  and who do I run into there at that seafar ing restaurant but my old friend, Joe the  Barrister, who  is a well known lawyer  in  those local parts and a big wheel, or so he  tells me,  in the lodge  that the barristers  have that they call the Passaic County Bar  Association.  So I make again with the hello's and how  are you's and what have you been up to and  who is the new doll in your life and all the  other chit chat that friends exchange when  they haven't seen each other for a long time  and Joe sits down with me and we both  order up juicy steaks and Joe fills me in on  how he is not only being a success in the  legal fraternity in New Jersey, but he has  also expanded his activities to get a piece of  the  action  in Washington, D.C., where  President Ronnie Reagan and  the other  pols hang out when they're not meeting at  Camp David or visiting Ronnie's ranch in  California.  Seems as if Joe now represents some com panies that got themselves into temporary  hot water with the Pentagon and the Air  Force what with charging more  than a  thousand bucks  for wrenches  that  they  order wholesale for $8.99 at a joint on Canal  Street and charging also nine hundred and  sixty nine bucks for a toilet seat cover that  they purchase for $5.73  from Sears Roe buck, Joe tells me also that he goes down to  Washington, D.C. as to try to smooth out  the ruffled feathers of the Pentagon and  the Air Force and while he is down there he  wangles two tickets to go  to the Gridiron  Dinner  that  the scribes who write  from  Washington run each year. The tickets are  $120 each which doesn't faze Joe who is bill ing it all to his clients anyhow and, besides  business is business, and who knows, he may  be able to talk to a general or an admiral at  the bar and put in a good word for one or  another of his clients with no animosity  about  the wrenches  and  the  toilet  seat  covers because everybody in the business is  doing the same thing and so will the gener als and the admirals when they retire and  start using their own connections to get a  job with some company they used to regu late.  So Joe calls up a doll he knows with whom  he  shacks up  sometimes when he  is  in  Washington, who is a secretary to a colonel  in the Air Force, and they dress up in their  fancy evening clothes and go to the Grid iron Dinner which is a special occasion this  time when it is held on March 23rd on a  Saturday evening on a very rainy night be cause it turns out that this is the hundredth  time  that  they have held  the Gridiron  Dinner and even the old pols in the District  of Columbia like Ronnie Reagan and Tip  O'Neill don't claim to go back that far.  So everybody who is anybody is there at  this hundredth running of the event and all  the faces you see on Hot Line or Meet the  Press are at the bar lapping it up and their  dolls are there too looking very pretty and  wearing dresses that cost enough to be a  worthwhile and very acceptable purse for a  big stake event. Seated at the head table are  the President, Ronnie Reagan, and Nancy,  ",1985

It has immense  and  threatening military power.  ruthlessly suppresses the freedom of  its people. Dissenters are imprisoned  or executed. Its troops have cruelly in vaded  Afghanistan.

1135,1083,13,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation to vali date conveyances of certain lands in  the State of California. This bill con cerns over 40 parcels of land that form  part of the right-of-way granted to the  Central  Pacific  Railway  Co.-now  known as the Southern Pacific Co.-by  an act of Congress in 1862. This bill is  important to my constituents, in par ticular,  the city of Tracy. Clouded  titles  to  the property bordering  the  Southern Pacific Railroad have made  it  very  difficult  to  sell  property,  borrow money against it, or develop it.  Consequently,  these  clouded  titles  have impeded investment and have en couraged the 50-percent vacancy rate  that currently exists in this area.  This  situation  arose  because  the  1862 act which granted railroad rights of-way required that if this land is not  used  for  railroad purposes,  it must  revert back  to  the Federal Govern ment. In the case of the land parcels  identified in this bill, Southern Pacific  sold the land to individuals and pri vate developers without first offering  it back  to  the Federal Government.  This bill removes all Federal interest  in this land and will grant consider able  relief  to my constituents who,  through no fault of their own, now  own property with unclear titles.  Without this bill, the clouded title  status of the lands in question is an ar tificial roadblock standing in the way  ",1985
1136,1122,13,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  ask unanimous consent to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend my remarks.  The SPEAKER. Is there objection?  The Chair will recognize the gentle man  from California  [Mr. McCAND LESS] at the proper time, when he has  recognized for unanimous consent for  1 minutes, and  trust that he would  notify the gentlemen he is bringing up  in this particular petition.  Speaker,  Mr. McCANDLESS. Mr. Speaker, I  admire your leadership. It is my un derstanding  that  the  rules  of  the  House permit a privileged resolution  to be heard.  The SPEAKER. The Chair is recog nizing unanimous consent requests for  1 minutes which we normally do.  Is there an objection?  In due time, there are two privileged  questions to be presented.  ",1985
1137,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, it is my under standing of the rules that the gentle man has raised a question of the privi leges of the House.  The SPEAKER. No;  the Chair did  not recognize the gentleman for that  purpose. The Chair was aware of the  fact  that the resolution was sent to  the clerk, and had so  informed him  that the gentlemen whose names were  on his petition should be notified so  that they could be in the Chamber,  and the Chair had not recognized the  gentleman for that purpose.  ",1985
1138,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, further  reserving the right to object, it is my  understanding  that  there  are  no  names in the particular petition that  the gentleman has. That is the infor mation that I have from the gentle man. I have not read it, but I under stand there are no names in it.  The SPEAKER. But there is an in ference, and the Chair thinks in fair ness, the gentleman should notify the  people that he has reference to so that  they at least would be able to be here  to defend themselves. That is a fair ness principle that the Speaker of this  House is trying to suggest is permitted  by rules of the House.  ",1985
1139,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right to object, we certainly want  the Chair to be fair. That is one of the  questions we have raised on a couple  of occasions recently.  But in this case, it seems to me that  the rules of the House specify that the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  McCANDLEss]  is permitted to raise a  question  of  the  privileges  of  the  House.  The  SPEAKER. He  certainly  is  when he  is  recognized for that pur pose, and the Chair has not yet recog nized the gentleman for that purpose.  ",1985
1140,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.,"  Can  the  Chair  inform us, further reserving the right  to object, when he will recognize the  gentleman?  The SPEAKER. The Chair will rec ognize the gentleman as soon as he en tertains unanimous  consent  request  for  the  1-minute  speeches. And  if  there  is  objection, Members  can  object, but the Chair is going through  the first row, and then he will be rec ognized for that purpose.  ",1985
1141,1122,13,Mr. WALKER., The gentleman will  be  recognized  immediately  following  the 1 minutes?  The  SPEAKER.  The  Members  whose names that he has reference to  should be notified so that he will allow  them  the opportunity  to be on  the  floor to defend themselves.  ,1985
1142,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, further  reserving  the right to object,  I now  have a copy of the resolution before  me, and I see no names in the resolu tion at all.  The SPEAKER. The Chair has a  copy of the resolution and the letter  the gentleman has referred to.  ",1985
1143,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, on the  understanding that the gentleman is  going  to be  recognized  immediately  following  the !-minutes, I will with draw my reservation. But I do believe  that in this instance the Chair has, in  fact, deferred a question of the privi leges of the House and I am somewhat  concerned about that particular prece dent being set under the rules as a  result.  The SPEAKER. So that the gentle man understands  the  rules,  unani mous-consent requests can under the  precedents, if the Chair desires to rec ognize  for  that purpose,  be  enter tained prior to a privileged resolution,  and that is what we are doing.  ",1985
1144,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right to object then,  the unani mous-consent request, as I understand  it, has been purported by the Chair in  order to prevent the gentleman from  California  [Mr. McCANDLESS]  from  raising his question.  The SPEAKER. If any Member ob jects to  the gentleman's unanimous consent request to speak for 1 minute,  the House can get to the question im mediately.  ",1985
1145,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right to object, am I not correct  that the Chair himself purported the  unanimous-consent request?  The SPEAKER. Let me say that the  Chair would normally have gone the  route of the 1 minutes. He saw the  gentleman  from California standing  knowing what was in the mind of the  gentleman, who had just sent a resolu tion to the desk, and trusting that the  gentleman, before he would raise his  question of privilege, would have the  courtesy of notifying  the Members  whose names he  is going  to  recom mend  to  the Standards Committee,  that he would so notify them so that  they would have the dignity of being  on  the  floor,  because  the  Chair  thought that that was the honorable  and decent way to handle this matter.  Now in view of that, we are now back  to the unanimous-consent request for  !-minutes.  0 1020  ",1985
1146,1122,13,Mr. WALKER.," Reserving the right  to object, Mr. Speaker,  the problem  here is-The SPEAKER. What is the gentle man objecting to?  ",1985
1147,1122,13,Mr. WALKER., The rules as I under stand it do not give the Chair the abil,1985
1148,1135,13,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  con gratulate Mr. KOSTMAYER  and Mr.  SMITH; I think they are very close on  this issue. A couple of things separate  them however that are important and  cannot be shoved aside.  Let me first of all be critical of the  Fascell substitute without being criti cal of Mr. FASCELL, who is one of my  favorite people. It does not put Con gress clearly on record as recognizing  and strongly condemning the Chinese  Government's use of forced abortion  and forced sterilization in its popula tion control program.  Now, Mr. FASCELL has said that his  version is less China bashing. Nobody  wants to bash anybody; but I must say  this House  is not at all reticent  in  pointing out human rights shortcom ings when it comes to the Philippines,  when it comes to South Africa or Cen tral America; why should we be so gen teel  and  concerned  about  ruffled  feathers and feelings when it comes to  coerced abortion, coerced sterilization,  and  infanticide  now  going  on  in  China?  If something is evil, let us call it evil.  That is the only way to address it. And  let us not try to euphemize something  that is a thoroughly evil practice.  Now the Smith amendment, in con trast  to  the Fascell amendment,  re quires the President to review the situ ation  in  the People's Republic  of  China on  an  annual basis  and  to  report on an annual basis. The Fascell  amendment has no such requirement.  Now, human rights abuses associated  with the People's Republic of China  Government program have been so se rious  and  so widespread  that such  monitoring by the executive and the  legislative branches is necessary.  The Fascell amendment allows the  President  to  reduce  funding  to  the  U.N. Fund for Population Activities  only if he makes an affirmative deter mination  that China has not made  progress  in eliminating forced abor tion and infanticide.  The Smith amendment permits the  President flexibility to adjust UNFP A  funding as he sees fit in response to  developments with respect to UNFP A  and China, but  the most  important  distinction is the earmarking.  Now,  there is no  incentive for  the  UNFP A to clean up its act in relation  to  the People's Republic of China's  programs of coerced abortion, coerced  sterilization, and  infanticide,  if  they  have  the  assurance  of  earmarked  funds.  Earmarking funds means they have  an entitlement. We are worried about  entitlements here, why  the romance  with the U.N. Family Planning Assist ance Program? When it has been in volved in funding, indirectly or direct ly these horrible antihuman practices  in China? Nonsense.  Now,  the Smith amendment does  not deny the UNFP A funds per se. It  leaves  it up  to  the President  to re spond to developments and progress or  lack thereof as it occurs on an annual  basis within the People's Republic of  China.  To earmark  funds  is  to give  the  UNFP A a preferred status, to say they  are locked in no matter what, they are  going to get their millions of dollars.  Now we have a  lot of problems in  this country,  trying to solve China's  population problem by paying a third  of the funds to the UNFP A does not  make much sense in the light of co erced abortions, coerced sterilization,  and infanticide.  Do not think that these are not cur rently going on; because the newspa pers,  the Washington Post, 60 Min utes, Public Broadcasting's Nova, the  U.S. Census Bureau, and others say  they are going on, and it is a current  practice.  I yield to my friend from Wisconsin.  ",1985
1149,1135,13,Mr. MOODY.," I thank the gentleman  in the well. There is no disagreement  on this side here about the things that  you say are going on.  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman,  I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentleman.  ",1985
1150,1135,13,Mr. HYDE., I yield to the gentleman  from Wisconsin.  ,1985
1151,1135,13,Mr. MOODY.,"  I  think  those of us  supporting  the  Fascell  amendment  have conceded and fully agree with  what the gentleman has said with one  exception: you said earmarking funds  for UNFP A would lock the President  in.  0 1200  As I think the gentleman would rec ognize, the Fascell amendment would  not lock the President in, and that is  the very point of it. It gives the Presi dent flexibility to dial down all money  for UNFP A right down to a zero level,  depending on the situation in China.  So the President is not locked in by  the Fascell amendment. Quite to the  contrary.  ",1985
1152,1135,13,Mr. HYDE.," If I could recapture my  time, what  the earmarking does  is  guarantee  16  percent  of whatever  funds for family planning will be dis bursed are earmarked for the UNFP A.  And  it  is my view  that earmarking  anything for them is a disincentive for  them to get out of supporting directly  or indirectly any population programs  which coerce abortions,  sterilization,  and to tolerate infanticide in China.  There is no need to earmark. The  UNFP A will get their funds if indeed  they act in the spirit with which this  amendment is being offered. But why  the romance with  the UNFP A, why  earmark funds  for  the UNFPA? We  are not excluding them, but we are not  guaranteeing them earmarked funds.  ",1985
1153,1135,13,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Chair man, will the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1154,1148,13,Mr. DEWINE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, in 1 minute let me  try to summarize what the  issue  is.  The  issue  is not about family plan ning. Every single penny is going to be  spent for family planning. So whether  you are for family planning or against  it, that is not the issue today.  The issue is abortion. The issue is  whether or not, and I will read directly  the quote, are we going to deny, and  here is the issue, not family planning,  the  issue  is are we going  to ""deny  funds to private foreign organizations  which perform or actively promote  abortion as a method of family plan ning."" That is the issue we are going  to be voting on in just a moment.  Our argument about fungibility does  make sense. As I pointed out earlier,  that is the argument your side of the  aisle always makes in the Grove City  example, that if you discriminate in a  college, we should completely cut off  all  funds. That has been  the argu ment, and it is an argument that cer tainly has some merit. Why doesn't  your  side  accept  that argument  in  regard to this issue, where the clear  goal of some organizations is to inte grate abortion and  family planning.  That is what these organizations are  actually doing.  What we are trying to do is to sepa rate these issues. You can be in favor  of family planning and against abor tion, and  that  is what  this  issue  is  about.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF NEW  JERSEY TO THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MS.  SNOWE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE AMENDMENT  OFFERED BY MR. SMITH OF NEW JERSEY  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment to  the amendment offered as a subsitute  for the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. SMITH of New  Jersey to the amendment offered by Ms.  SNOWE  a.s a substitute for the amendment  offered by Mr. SMITH of New Jersey: At the  end of the substitute insert the following:  ""The President, if he determines that to  do so would promote voluntary family plan ning goals, not withstanding paragraphs <A>  and <B>. may deny  funds  for population  planning purposes under this part to a for eign country, an international organization,  or a nongovernmental organization, and he  may deny or require denial of funds <or  goods or services financed with such funds)  to any direct or indirect recipient of funds,  goods, or services from a foreign country, an  international orgainization, or a nongovern mental organization which  receives  those  funds under this part for population plan ning purposes,  because of the types of voluntary and non coercive family planning programs which it  carries out or promotes, or for which it pro vides funds, goods, or services <directly or  through another entity), even if it does so  entirely with funds other than the funds  made available by the United States under  this part.  I  is  Objection  CHAIRMAN.  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey (during  the  reading). Mr. Chairman,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the amend ment be considered as read and print ed in the RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  New Jersey?  ",1985
1155,1148,13,Mr.  FASCELL.," Mr. Chairman,  object.  The  heard.  ",1985
1156,1148,13,Mr.  FASCELL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  think it would be real nice if we had a  copy of the amendment, and I reserve  a point of order against the amend ment.  The CHAIRMAN .. The gentleman  reserves a point of order against the  amendment.  The Clerk will continue reading the  amendment.  The Clerk concluded the reading of  the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from New Jersey [Mr. SMITH] is recog nized  in support of his amendment.  The gentleman is still operating under  the  time  limitation, and he has 5¥2  minutes remaining.

1158,1148,13,Mr. FASCELL.," Mr. Chairman, I just  want to be sure what the procedural  position is that we are in here right  now, having reserved a point of order.  But as I understand it, there is a pri mary amendment,  then  there  is an  amendment in the nature of a substi tute. I am trying to find out what this  latest offering is.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will  state that before the committee now is  a perfecting amendment by the gentle man from New Jersey [Mr. SMITH] to  the substitute amendment offered by  the gentlewoman  from Maine  [Ms.  SNOWE].  The Chair will further state that the  first vote,  then, will  come on  the  Smith  perfecting  amendment,  the  second vote on the Snowe substitute,  and  the  third vote  on  the Smith  amendment.  ",1985
1159,1148,13,Mr. FASCELL.," On  this  tree, Mr.  Chairman, that we have been present ed with, is there anything hanging on  the primary amendment?  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will  state that no perfecting amendment  has been offered to the amendment.  ",1985
1160,1148,13,Mr. FASCELL.," I thank the Chair.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog nizes the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. SMITH] and he has 5% minutes.  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I will keep it very brief.  This amendment simple restates my  original goal, and that is to preserve  the President's Mexico City  policy  which  is  now  current policy. This  amendment will give the Congress an  affirmative  opportunity  to  vote  in  favor of that policy, which  requires  that nongovernment foreign-based or ganizations  receiving U.S.  funds not  perform or actually promote abortion.  Our money will be conditioned upon  whether or not they provide abortions  out of  it with  their own money or  ours.  ",1985
1161,1148,13,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I would  be happy to yield  to the gentleman  from New York.  ",1985
1162,1148,13,Mr. KEMP.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the Smith amendment, as I did  for the previous Smith amendment. It  was not only  the  position  of  the  United States at the Mexico City con ference to deny funds to any private  foreign organization which performed  or actively promoted abortion as a  method of family planning; that policy  was consistent with the world popula tion plan of action which was adopted  at that conference which also states  that abortion ""in no case should be  promoted as a method of family plan ning.''  0 1350  The issue, I would say to my distin guished colleagues, is not family plan ning versus no family planning. The  Smith amendment will not decrease  funding for family planning programs  by 1 cent. I favor a continuing commit ment to these programs. But it should  not be our policy to include the use of  abortion as a method of family plan ning and it seems to me that is very  clear that most of the Members agree.  They will get their best chance to re state how they view family planning  and the issue of abortion by their vote  on the Smith amendment.  ",1985
1163,1148,13,Mr. GEJDENSON.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1164,1148,13,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Chairman, first  I  want to quote for my dear colleague,  ",1985

1166,1161,13,Mr. GILMAN., I yield to the gentle man from Florida.  ,1985
1167,1161,13,Mr. FASCELL.," I  man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  the gentleman has  discussed this amendment on this side.  We have examined it. We agree with  the gentleman. We are prepared  to  accept the amendment.  ",1985
1168,1161,13,Mr. GILMAN.,"  I  thank the gentle man for his kind words.  Mr. Chairman, the minority has no  objection to the amendment on this  side.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from New York [Mr. GILMAN]  to  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Washington [Mr. MILLER].  The amendment to the amendment  was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Washington [Mr. MILLER],  as amended.  The amendment, as amended, was  agreed to.  AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. LOWERY OF  CALIFORNIA  ",1985
1169,1161,13,Mr. LOWERY  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.

COMMUNIST COUNTRIES.  Chapter 3 of part I of the Foreign Assist ance Act of 1961  is  further amended by  adding at the end thereof the following new  section:    ""SEC. 309. COMMUNIST COUNTRIES.

1173,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," I understand we  have worked together and I think we  have tried to do things in a bipartisan  effort. And you know,  I am one of  those  fellows  that  listened  to  the  debate of the President of the United  States in October 1984, and he said  ""Never."" And for 6 months, he has  traumatized 150,000 constituents that  live in my district, that do not know  whether or not they are going to get  their lousy 4 percent increase so that  next year they could live at the same  level that they lived at last year, and  that is the reason for this. And it is  not in any way to suggest that I do not  have  faith  in  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr. GRAY]  because  I  have the utmost faith in him. I have  the utmost faith in the system that we  are now pursuing  But as late as this morning, Senator  DOLE did not suggest that either the  Social Security COLA's were off the  table or any others.

But I have to say something  else.  There were at least 2 nights where I  stayed in that chair for 4 hours to alle viate  the Speaker of  this House so  that we could listen about an election  process in one of the 50 States. And we  went on, and on, and on ad infinitum  ",1985

1176,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  In response now, I would say that we  are taking an hour today, and the only  reason we are taking an hour today is  once and for all I would like the House  of Representatives to  tell the senior  citizens of America, and all of  the  other  entitlement  beneficiaries  in  America that no longer is the COLA a  part of the deficit problem or the bal ancing of the budget problem in 1985.  ",1985
1177,1174,13,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield to me?  ",1985
1178,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI., I yield to the gen tleman from Minnesota for purposes  of debate only.  ,1985
1179,1174,13,Mr. WEBER.," I would just ask the  gentleman, the gentleman says he is  not doing this to waste the time of the  body, but to put this issue to rest once  and for all. Is it not true that this is a  nonbinding resolution?  ",1985
1180,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Yes, it is.  ",1985
1181,1174,13,Mr. WEBER.," Then it does not put  this to rest once and for all, does it?  ",1985
1182,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," You know, per haps I should say that the gentleman  on the other side of the aisle missed  the point. I do not think there is a  Member in the U.S. House of Repre sentatives that does not know how he  is going to vote on this issue.  But I  think there are 330 million  Americans that question how their in dividual  representative will vote on  this issue because of prior statements  made by prior  individuals  indicating  that certain  things would never be  done  that  have  been  done  for  6  months. And all I am doing is, as a  freshman Member of Congress, trying  to once and for all close the door to  anyone, whether it be the news media  in America, or whether it be the Mem bers of the House of Representatives,  the Members of the U.S. Senate, or  the members of this administration, or  any one of the 230 Americans,  that  the COLA's and the entitlement pro grams in America in 1985 are not to be  considered in the deficit reduction to  this budget. It is over.  And where we move from there, and  how we will join, I may be a person  that participates very heavily with  gentlemen on both sides of this aisle  to work this problem out, but I do not  want the problem worked on the anxi ety of the senior citizens or the enti tlement beneficiaries in America any  more. I have had it, and we are taking  1 hour to send that message  today,  that no one need consider that prob lem ever again in 1985.  And I hope,  I hope since the late  1970's, since 1981 and 1983, those of us  that will seek election to this House  have the common courage to say that  when we make a pledge, we will stand  by that pledge during the term of our  office in that particular Congress. And  that is what I am going to do, and that  is what I did in 1984. And I want to  send a message  to my constituents,  and  throughout America,  that  they  can rely on the Members of the U.S.  House of Representatives on our indi vidual pledges and know where we are  taking 1  going  to stand and we are  hour to do that.  Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield to me?  ",1985
1183,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," I yield to the gen tleman from Oregon for purposes of  debate only.  Mr. AuCOIN. I appreciate the gen tleman yielding.  The gentleman has  just  indicated  what he is unwilling this year to see  happen, and that is the purpose of his  motion. What he is unwilling to see  happen is any adjustment on COLA's  or entitlements.  I assume that the gentleman also is  unwilling  to see a  tax  increase  this  year; is that true? I would ask the gen tleman that question.  ",1985
1184,1174,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Quite frankly, I  think I am very surprised to have lis tened to the President's speech when  he talks about a neutral tax increase,  but, in fact, he recognizes that a large  segment of  the American successful  business community has not paid a  minimum tax as they did prior to 1981.  And he is willing to raise that tax, but  use that tax to soothe the voting spir its of the rest of Americans and make  them think they are going to get a tax  break on the proposals that he made  about a month ago, the President of  the United States. And quite frankly, I  do not want to get into a debate on the  tax issue.  But I am perfectly agreeable, and I  will  tell the gentleman quite clearly  that if we are looking for revenues to  offset these deficits, and I am one that  is doing it, I am going to support legis lation  to provide  for minimum  tax ation against 90,000 profitable Ameri can corporations that last year did not  pay any taxes. And I am going to do  that a lot sooner than I am going to  ask the recipients of Social Security,  and black lung, and veterans' pensions  and some other benefits to pay for the  burden of this deficit.  Mr. AuCOIN. Will  yield again?  ",1985

1188,1187,13,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. DoRNAN of  California: Page 68, after line 9, insert the  following new section:  SEC. 518. DRUG TRAFFICKING AND THE PROBLEM  OF TOTAL CONFIDENTIALITY OF CER TAIN FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS.  <a> F'INDINGs.-The Congress finds that (1 > several banks in Latin America and the  Caribbean are used by narcotics traffickers  as depositories for money obtained in pro viding illicit drugs to the United States and  other countries of the region;  <2>  offshore banks which provide  total  confidentiality provide a service which ma terially assists the operations of illicit drug  traffickers; and  (3) cooperation in gaining access  to the  bank accounts of such narcotics traffickers  would materially assist United States au thorities in controlling the activities of such  traffickers.  (b) POLICY.-The Congress( 1) requests the President to seek to nego tiate  treaties with all countries providing  such confidential offshore banking, espe cially  those  in  the Caribbean  region,  in  order that the United States Government  could obtain access to the bank accounts of  known drug traffickers for the purpose of  recovering illegally acquired funds;  <2> directs the President to include reports  on the results of such efforts in the annual  International Narcotics Control Strategy  Report; and  <3> reaffirms its intention to obtain maxi mum cooperation on the part of all govern ments for the purpose of halting interna tional drug  trafficking, and constantly  to  evaluate the cooperation of  those govern ments receiving assistance from the United  States.  Mr. SMITH of Florida <during the  reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unani mous consent that the amendment be  considered as read and printed in the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Florida?  There was no objection.  ",1985
1189,1187,13,Mr. DORNAN  of California.," Mr.  Chairman, as one who has worked for  many years against the curse of illicit  narcotics trafficking in this country, I  have introduced this amendment for  the purpose of obtaining cooperation  from countries close  to  the United  States which offer confidential off shore banking service in gaining access  to  illicit narcotics profits. There are  several of these, Cayman Islands, Ba hamas, Panama, and the Netherlands  Antilles among others. No one is op posed to confidentiality of banking. It  is an extension of the right of privacy  which we  all uphold. Yet  like any  right, it can be used for wrong pur poses. In this case, money obtained by  selling cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or a  myriad of other narcotics  is  trans ferred  to confidential, perhaps num bered, bank accounts in one or more of  these banking havens. Through ""false  front"" business this money is reinvest ed in additional narcotics trafficking.  My amendment calls on the Presi dent to seek treaties with these vari ous banking haven governments which  would enable this government to re claim narcotics profits. As a precedent  I refer to the Swiss-American Treaty  on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Mat ters. This agreement was concluded on  May 25, 1973, and went into effect 4  years later. It was not easy to obtain,  given differences between the civil law  of the United States and the common  law of Switzerland. Yet this excellent  treaty is on the books and has specific  provisions  dealing  with  organized  crime. For those who wish to research  this treaty it can be found in 27 UST,  pages 2021 to 2065.  I should point out that negotiations  with  responsible  governments  have  been underway and in some instances  have already met with success. I un derstand from the Bureau of Interna tional Narcotics matters at the State  Department  that  negotiations with  Britain on the Cayman Islands were  actually completed  last winter. But  there is no agreement with the Baha mas as yet, nor with Panama.  How much money  is  involved? We  don't know, for obvious reasons. Some  estimate that the total domestic take  in this country is over $100 billion a  year. A substantial portion of this is in  confidential accounts, and appropriate  agreements could result in the return  of much of that illicit take.  This measure is not aimed at non narcotics money, and is not designed  to provide a  fishing  license for  this  Government to rummage through the  legitimate accounts of law-abiding citi zens. My specific  intent  is  that we  press to eliminate a safe haven for the  ill-gotten gains of the drug traffickers  who prey on  this country's citizens.  Thousands of Americans have died by  overdose and dozens have been shot as  innocent bystanders in drug war gun  fights.  I believe that President Reagan's ad ministration has demonstrated a keen  and significant dedication to the prob lem of reducing narcotics  trafficking  in the United States and throughout  this hemisphere and elsewhere. The  Congress is deeply interested in sup porting such an effort. I believe this  amendment can demonstrate the Con gress' interest in the administration's  efforts  to obtain treaties which will  help make life miserable for narcotics  traffickers and  regain money which  would  otherwise  be  beyond  reach,  money stained with blood and agony  beyond description.  One technical point. Since the De partment of State already reports an nually  to  the Congress on narcotics  policy developments, I have changed  the language in section (b)(2)  to  in clude my  requested  report  in  the  annual international narcotics control  strategy report, beginning in 1986.  I urge my colleagues to accept this  measure.  ",1985

The gentleman under stands that we have already discussed  this amendment and this side is pre pared to take it. We are working under  some time constraints and there are  others who wish to talk.  If the gentleman would continue to  yield, I would be happy on behalf of  this side to accept the amendment. We  think it is a good amendment. It is  well intentioned. We are working that  way already with the Cayman Islands.  We would like to see the President  urge the negotiation of other kinds of  treaties with other areas where we  continue to have difficulty.  If the gentleman at this point would  yield to the other gentleman, then we  will accept the amendment at the ap propriate time.  0 1650  ",1985
1193,1187,13,Mr. DORNAN of California., I thank  the gentleman.  ,1985
1194,1200,13,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman,  my amendment achieves two key ob jectives. First, it insures that the Con tras cannot use any of the humanitari an assistance for military purposes, for  barter, or any type exchange. Specifi cally, it tightens up the humanitarian  aid to the point where it can only be  used for food, clothing, and medicine.  I was deeply concerned about a state ment that Alfonse Robelo, one,  the  Contra leaders, made in FBIS, June  25, 1985. ""That money-the humani tarian  aid  approved  by Congress would be used  to buy arms on  the  black market and equip the fighters,  the FDN."" Under  this  amendment,  such a dangerous diversion could not  occur.  Second, my  amendment  reaffirms  congressional intent on human rights  violations  and U.S.  assistance. The  Contras have systematically violated  human  rights,  and  this must  stop.  Under this amendment, the President  can suspend this aid if he finds that  the Contras are engaged in gross viola tions of human rights. I expect the  State Department to monitor Contra  human  rights practices  comprehen sively, especially since there appear to  be some versions serious and signifi cant  human  rights  abuses.  This  amendment does not intend to legiti mize the Contras. Its intent is to place  them under the tightest scrutiny pos sible. The Contras may not be worthy  of receiving U.S. humanitarian assist ance based on  their human  rights  abuses and their diversion of humani tarian aid for military purposes. This  amendment would provide  the hook  for  the U.S. Government to cut off  Contras aid if they violate these two  conditions.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  simply clarifies  congressional  intent  about our basic policy toward Nicara gua. The goal is not a military solution  to conflict in Nicaragua; it is not the  overthrow of the Nicaraguan Govern ment. The goal is to promote the Con tadora prQcess and pressure Nicaragua  to  cease  the  violations  of  human  rights in Nicaragua. It is  to put the  Nicaraguan Government  on  notice  that the United States is prepared to  join in regional initiatives and employ  sanctions  if  there  is  no  progress  toward  these  goals. On  the other  hand, this amendment makes it clear  that we  are  aiming at negotiation  rather than confrontation; and recon ciliation rather than destruction.  The current embargo is just the sort  of sanction mentioned in my amend ment. But not it would be placed in  the context not of a  drive  toward  direct U.S.  intervention in the area,  but a measure which will be lifted as  soon as we receive strong signals and  see positive measures which address  our concerns.

(2)  SUPPORT  FOR  ACTIVITIES  OF  HUMAN  RIGHTS GROUPS.-It is the sense of the Con gress that<A> human rights groups in Guatemala,  particularly the Group for Mutual Support,  should be allowed to carry out their work  against human rights abuses with the full  cooperating, protection, and support of the  Government of Guatemala; and  <B> whether the Government of Guatema la allows human rights groups,  including  the Group for Mutual Support, to carry out  their work should be taken into account by  the United States in determining whether  there is human rights progress in Guatema la.  re thank the gentle Mrs. BOXER (during the reading).

1212,1200,13,Mr. FASCELL.," I  woman.  Mr. Chairman,  I  am  offering  a  simple, bipartisan amendment to the  foreign aid bill which expresses  the  sense of Congress  that  the Govern ment of Guatemala should allow that  country's only  independent  human  rights  group,  the Mutual Support  Group, to carry out its work against  human  rights abuses.  It also states  that the government's treatment of  human  rights groups,  including  the  Mutual Support Group,  should  be  taken  into  account by  the United  States in determining whether there is  human rights progress in Guatemala.  The military regime  in Guatemala  has been condemned by practically  every human rights group in existence  for its unmatched brutality. The Brit ish  Parliamentary  Human  Rights  Group recently noted:  In a 30-year war against their own people,  the Guatemalan military have created a  nation of widows and disappeared <people>.  Over 100,000 people have been killed and  38,000 disappeared.  Moreover, the State Department re cently confirmed that brutal and un speakable torture is commonplace in  Guatemala.  There  have,  however,  been  some  recent signs of hope. In June 1984, a  group  of women who met while  searching for their husbands' bodies in  the Guatemala City morgue decided to  ",1985
1213,1213,13,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask the  gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCoL LUM] a couple of questions, because I  wonder  if he knows  that both  the  Committee on the Judiciary and the  Committee on Appropriations have au thorized the FBI to have this program  to  train United States and  foreign  police  officers  from  the Caribbean  area  in basic  criminal  investigative  matters. This  is an established pro gram that is in Puerto Rico, and the  name of  it  is  the Caribbean Police  School.  This has been offered twice during  1982, twice in 1983, and twice in 1984  for 4 weeks each. During the six ses sions, more than 80 police from 16 dif ferent foreign countries were trained.  I would  ask  the gentleman  from  Florida why his amendment is neces sary and what does it envisage?  Does the gentleman from Florida en visage hundreds of FBI agents going  down there and training people, or do  you have in mind increasing the scope  of the school that is already estab lished in Puerto Rico?  Mr. McCOLLUM. If the gentleman  will yield, I would be glad to explain  that this is more than training; but on  the training score, I envision that we  have the same kind of training being  given to the police forces that are in  those academies, but then some more  training, specifically conducive to the  conditions in El Salvador in fighting a  guerilla war, which requires, it seems  to me, a major thrust in-country, to  train those police forces.  Plus,  in addition  to the training and by the way, special  training on  human rights violations so they do not  do  that-plus  the equipping of  this  police force. As I said earlier, there are  only 22 vehicles the police force has  down there; they have no radios, no  radios in those cars; they cannot com municate. I envision providing some of  those.  I  envision us providing  them  with  better  handguns  and  normal  weapons  that they need  to use, be cause as I said earlier, we are talking  about a war in the cities that is incred ible; that is being fought down there  now, and unless we want to see the  military  forces move  into  the cities  down there, we are going to have to  have a police force that really knows  what  it is doing, and some  training  program in Puerto Rico is simply not  good enough; the Embassy and I have  been in contact about this; the State  Department and I have been in con tact about it, and since the June 19 sit uation they are really upset, and they  by no means think that the training  that you described is anywhere near  adequate, and certainly does not pro vide any equipment.  ",1985
1214,1213,13,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Has  President Duarte asked for this kind  of aid?  Mr. McCOLLUM.  I do not have a  formal request from anyone, but I do  know that there is cable traffic that  came out of our Embassy requesting  that, that it is sitting at the Salvador an desk of the State Department, that  those on the Salvadoran desk at the  State Department as recently as this  afternoon told me that they want this  in the bill; that they have not sent up  a formal request because it has just re cently come to them, but that if it is  not put in this bill, they are going to  have to send up a formal request for  immediate action.  It seems to me this is the appropri ate place to put it in right now, Mr.  Chairman,  instead of waiting until  some more  servicemen  and  other  people have been killed down there.  ",1985
1215,1213,13,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I am not a member of this  committee, and I would hope that an  important principle like this would be  studied in great depth by the Commit tee on Foreign Affairs, and that hear ings should be had and a formal re quest should really come from Presi dent Duarte  for  something of  this  magnitude.  We have established this very impor tant school in Puerto Rico for exactly  the same purpose that the gentleman  from Florida describes,  that  is  the  heart of his amendment.  ",1985

1221,1239,13,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  join my colleagues  in  stressing the importance of continued  resolve in pursuing the release of the  remaining American hostages being  held in Beirut. Those seven-who have  been held longer and in more mystery  than the passengers on TWA flight  847-deserve the full commitment of  the Congress and the American people  in securing their release.  Among  the TWA hostages was  a  family from Hutchinson, KS: Bob and  Lou Peel, Bob, Jr., and Kristi. They  are home now, and I had the good for tune to spend some time with them  while I was in Kansas last week. Obvi ously, they are all relieved to be home  together again,  as was  their entire  community  thrilled  to  have  them  home. But  they have not forgotten  the fact that there are other hostages  still being held in Beirut, and I know  from our conversations that the Peels  very deeply want to see the other hos tages returned. I share their commit ment. Mter the TWA hostages were  taken, I posted a yellow ribbon on my  office door as a symbol of my hope  and resolve for their release. I intend  to keep that ribbon on my door until  the remaining seven are returned to  us, and I encourage each of my col leagues to do the same with the yellow  ribbons I sent them at that time.  Situations like those hostage takings  make it abundantly clear that we are  not living in ordinary times and that  we cannot expect ordinary means to  resolve conflicts and problems. Which  of us would have  thought  that  it  would be the Syrians who would be in strumental in securing the release of  the TWA hostages? They certainly  were not  an  obvious  choice. That  shows that we must pursue innovative  and creative diplomatic avenues in the  face of such terroristic acts. To do so, I  think the President would be well ad vised to proceed with appointments to  the Board of  the U.S.  Institute of  Peace which he was  statutorily  re quired to make by this past April 20.  The Institute is designed to encourage  research and training in the area of  conflict resolution. The authorization  is not large, but its potential for con tributing to resolution of such tense  situations-or better yet, their avoid ance-could be dramatic. The Institute  of Peace would not be a policymaking  entity, but it could very well spur cre ative thinking which would be benefi cial  to  those with policymaking  re sponsibilities.    ",1985
1222,1239,13,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, al though we rejoiced at the return of  the 39 American hostages, overshad owing that celebration was  the fact  that 7 Americans still remain helpless  captives of warring factions of militant  Lebanese religious groups. The United  States must not tolerate this outrage  to its citizens.  President Reagan made note of the  seven remaining hostages  in his  re marks  during  the  recent  hijacking  crisis and again when the hostages re turned  home.  This  President  has  found, just as his predecessor did, that  solutions  to the  taking of American  hostages are difficult. However, unlike  President Carter, President Reagan  apparently refuses to immerse himself  in the day-to-day efforts necessary to  secure the safe release of all our hos tages. Now that a piece of the crisis is  resolved, more than words are needed.  The President must continue to press  for the immediate and safe return of  all hostages, some of whom have been  imprisoned for more than a year.

1223,1252,13,Mr.  LUKEN.," Mr.  Speaker,  once  again Americans learned of the loss of  four of our young men who were serv ing their country in a far off land.  These  four  young marines were  taken from us by a barbaric act carried  out by terrorists who do not even have  the courage  to  identify  themselves.  Their cowardly act  resulted  in  the  tragic death of Cpl. Gregory Weber, of  my district in Cincinnati, OH.  My heart goes out to Mr. and Mrs.  John Weber who have lost their son,  and to the relatives and loved ones of  all the victims of this crime.  Such acts challenge our country's  will and our capacity to protect Ameri can citizens in sensitive areas of the  world. Following the bombing of our  Embassy in Beirut the State Depart ment announced  that  it was  taking  steps to meet such attacks.  With acts of terrorism and loss of  AmericP,n  life in places like Lebanon  and Central America, I am today re questing that the State Department  and Navy fully investigate the events  surrounding  this  incident. State De partment officials have told me that  currently  they are not  taking  any  action on the scene to investigate or  act to apprehend the perpetrators of  the crime. In view of our deep involve ment in El Salvador I have demanded  that  the Department of State and  Navy launch an immediate investigaJuly 10, 1985  tion and report their findings to Con gress.  We must do all we can to prevent  such tragedies from occurring in the  future, so Americans will not be awak ened to learn of the loss of their chil dren.e  TERROR FROM THE LEFT IN EL  SALVADOR  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 10, 1985  e ",1985
1224,1252,13,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  yes, there is terrorism from the left in  El Salvador in spite of what some crit ics of  that country may  say. The  recent planned killings of four U.S.  marines is proof of the fact that Com munist leftwing death squads do exist.  Their brutal terrorist activities are in creasing, while the terror of the right  has declined.  While much has been said and writ ten about rightwing death squads in El  Salvador, many of my colleagues  in  the House have chosen to ignore the  death squads of the left. The Salva doran Army is hurting the leftist guer rillas in the rural areas and the insur gents are shifting their operations to  urban areas. Their urban  terrorism  has taken the lives of many civilians  and  innocent Salvadorans  in  recent  months. Mayors have been killed as  well as simple peasants who just hap pened to be standing in the way of the  terrorists' bullets. Lieutenant Com mander Schaufelberger of  the U.S.  Navy was slain by the leftist Clara Ra mirez Front in 1983.  In the most recent terrorist incident,  leftist guerrillas, disguised as Salva doran soldiers, attacked a group of pa trons at a  row of outdoor cafes  in  downtown San Salvador. After spray ing the crowded cafes with automatic  weapons fire, the guerrillas began to  methodically execute those who were  still alive. A  total of 15 people were  killed in the cowardly attack. Among  the dead were four embassy marine se curity guards and  two other Ameri cans who were employees of Wang  Laboratories. Salvadorans and Guate malans were also killed in the attack.  All of the marines were off duty, un armed, and dressed in civilian clothes.  The American Embassy in San Sal vador believes  that  the attack was  planned and  that  the marines were  singled out by the killers who were  probably members of the leftist Fara bundo  Marti  National  Liberation  Front.  Let's call a spade a spade. In spite of  what  they say about wanting peace  and desiring to  improve the lives of  Salvadoran citizens, the guerrillas of  the  left are using  terrorism against  the people they say they are helping.

1225,1265,13,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  today I  have  introduced  the Trade Adjust ment Assistance Renewal Act of 1985.  This comprehensive bill would make  substantial improvements in the oper ation of the Trade Adjustment Assist ance  Program  for American  workers and firms that are bearing the  brunt of our disastrous trade policy in  lost jobs and markets. The bill extends  the authority for T AA for 4 additional  years without adding great additional  expense.  Soon  the Trade Subcommittee of  the House Ways and Means Commit tee will be marking up legislation to  extend the T AA Program. My bill re flects what  I  believe  this Congress  should do to make T AA an even better  program  for a  growing numbers of  American workers  and businessmen  who urgently need it.  Following  is a description of each  section of the legislation:  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  SUMMARY OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE  RENEWAL ACT OF 1985, AS INTRODUCED  TITLE I-WORKER ADJUSTMENT  ASSISTANCE  SECTION 1: GROUP ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  Section 1 extends for the period of a reau thorized program the existing import causa tion standard for certification of petitioning  groups of workers as eligible to apply for  T AA. That standard requires that increased  imports ""contributed importantly"" to signif icant worker layoffs and sales and/or pro duction declines of the workers' firm or sub division.  Section 1 also expands  the coverage of  program certification authority under sec tion 222 of the Trade Act in two respects:  (1) to workers in independent firms supply ing ""essential parts or essential services"" to  firms or subdivisions producing import-im pacted end products; and < 2 > to workers laid  off or threatened with layoff by reason of  the relocation of production functions of  that firm or subdivision to a foreign coun try.  The amendments under section 1 would  apply to petitions for certification filed on  or after October 1, 1985.  SECTION 2: QUALIFYING REQUIREMENTS  Section 2 amends section 23l<a)(2) of the  Trade Act to increase the maximum number  of weeks of employer-authorized  leave or  leave to serve as a union representative or a  disability covered by workmen's compensa tion that may be weeks counted toward the  minimum 26 weeks of employment in the 52  weeks preceding layoff required for individ ual certified workers  to qualify for TRA  benefits. Weeks in which a worker is laid off  for any reason if he receives back pay would  also be included as weeks of disability. This  amendment would apply to petitions for cer tification filed on or after October 1, 1985.  SECTION 3: LIMITATIONS ON TRADE  READJUSTMENT ALLOWANCES  Section 3 amends section 233 to authorize  a worker to receive his basic 26-week TRA  entitlement during a 2-year period instead  of the current 1-year period. Delays in the  certification process by the Labor Depart ment and in approval of training by state  employment  agencies  are  causing  some  workers to forfeit some of their TRA bene fits. In addition, workers recalled temporari ly are losing TRA benefits because of the re quirement that it be paid within a 52-week  period after exhausting regular UI. Further more, the Labor Department expects to lose  ground on the processing of petitions for  certification, especially since voluntary re straints on auto imports were not renewed.  Section 3  also  requires  that a worker  apply for training through the local employ ment office the first time that he applies  for TRA benefits. This provision requires  that a worker apply for training upon ex haustion of his basic 26 week of UI. It em phasizes to the worker the importance of  training to adjustment and it underscores  the need for a worker to seriously consider  training rather than treat TRA benefits as  extended UI. It would also overcome the ar bitrary requirement that a worker sign up  for training within 210 days of being certi fied in order to be eligible for TRA while in  training, if that worker subsequently needs  training.  Section 3 also authorizes a worker to col lect up to 52 additional weeks of TRA bene fits beginning with  the first week that a  worker enters training if that training has  not been approved until after the last week  of entitlement to basic TRA benefits. Cur18537  rently some workers are not receiving even  half of the TRA benefits to which they are  entitled while  in approved  training. Dou bling  the period during which a worker  could  receive TRA benefits, while  in ap proved training, would redress administra tive delays that unfairly penalize a worker.  More  importantly,  this provision  stresses  training  and  readjustment  for workers,  while providing some means of  financial  support while workers are  retraining  for  new lines of work.  SECTION 4: worker training  Section 4 amends worker training provi sions under section 236 of the Trade Act in  four respects. The Sec.retary of Labor would  be required to approve training if the five  statutory conditions under existing law are  met,  thereby  removing  lack of sufficient  funds as a reason for not approving train ing. Section 4 adds a clarification to section  236(a)(l) that if funds to pay training costs  are not available at the time a worker enters  training, such costs shall be paid for as soon  as possible from the next appropriation of  funds.  Section 4 also amends section 236 to stipu late  that  the  statutory  requirement  for  training approval of a ""reasonable expecta tion of employment"" following training does  not require the availability of an offer of  employment  immediately  upon  training  completion.  Finally, section 4 authorizes employers to  be reimbursed through the T AA program  for costs associated with providing suitable  employer-sponsored  training  regardless of  whether a worker uses a voucher or not to  secure a  training slot. The reimbursement  would be at a cost equivalent to the amount  paid in the private sector or by the state.  This provision moves  the T AA  program  toward rationalizing and maximizing train ing opportunities, while it recognizes the le gitimacy of JTPA emphasis upon on-the-job  training.  The  amendments  to  worker  training  under section 4 would apply to workers cov ered by certification issued after September  30, 1982.  SECTION s: TRAINING VOUCHERS  Section  5  further  amends  the worker  training provisions under section 236 of the  Trade Act to establish a voucher system as  an alternative method to the present pro gram by which a worker may obtain on-the job or other approved  training if certain  conditions are met.  SECTION 6: AGREEMENTS WITH STATES  REGARDING TRAINING  Section 6 amends section 239  to require  state  employment  agencies  to  advise  a  worker to apply for  training at the  time  that he applies for TRA benefits and  to  interview and review with that worker suita ble training opportunities within 60 days of  when that worker first applies for training.  SECTION 7: SPECIAL ACCOUNT FOR ADJUSTMENT  ASSISTANCE  Section ~, amends section 245 of the Trade  Act to establish a Special Account consist ing of appropriations from Customs reve nues to fund the costs of the T AA programs  for both workers and firms. This amend ment would take effect on October 1, 1985.  SECTION 8: SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING APPROVAL OF PETITIONS FOR ADJUSTMENT AS SISTANCE  This  is  a  free-standing  provision  that  states  the sense of  the Congress  to  the  effect that whenever there occurs a net in",1985
1226,3,18,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Speaker,  to morrow we will  be  taking up  the  debate on  the 1985  farm bill. Next  Thursday we will be voting on amend ments on that 1985 farm bill.  For those of us from the Midwest,  where  agriculture and our  farmers,  small towns, and businesses are being  devastated by the present farm econo my, there is one necessary provision in  that farm bill. That is basically known  as the Bedell provision, named after  the gentleman from Iowa, BERKELEY  BEDELL, providing for a referendum for  a provision for a voluntary program  for the farmers that permits the farm ers to vote on the program itself.  That is  the only provision in that  farm bill  that will  provide  for  in creased income for our farmers in the  next 4 years. Without that provision,  farmers in the Midwest can look for ward to decreases in their net income.  They are being devastated right now  with  farm  prices  and  they  cannot  afford any lower farm prices.  So I ask all of my colleagues, when  the amendment which will be offered,  I understand, from the minority side  to delete that provision, that you sup port the Bedell p:i'Ovision and oppose  any amendment to strike it out.  IS THE PRICE OF REPRESENTA TIVE GOVERNMENT BECOMING  TOO HIGH?  <Mrs.  BENTLEY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1985
1227,3,18,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, a small town in my State effec tively lost representative government.  It was priced out of the market. When  its liability insurance coverage was ter minated, virtually all of the officials  resigned  from  office. They  simply  couldn't afford  to put their families  and careers at risk without some pro tection  from  the  flood  of  lawsuits  which are now a fact of life in govern ment units smaller than State size.  Unfortunately,  this  incident is nei ther unusual nor trivial. Other munici palities in my State are about to lose  their liability  insurance. In some  in stances,  this loss of protection could  mean the loss of police and fire protec tion for the citizens of the community.  In a society caught up in the frenzy  of  suing  everyone  for  everything,  members of police and  fire departments are unlikely  to perform  their  duties without a guarantee that they  will not be bankrupted by the costs of  litigation, let alone the amount of a  judgment.  The problem will soon enough be na tionwide, if it is not already so. It is a  Federal problem as well as a State  problem. Many  of  these  suits  are  founded on legislation passed in Con gress over the past few decades. We  had better find a solution before we  find that representative government is  too expensive a luxury.  is  CASTRO'S ABSURD IDEA  <Mr. SMITH of Florida asked and  was given permission to address  the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks and include extra neous matter.)  ",1985
1228,3,18,Mr. SMITH of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  2 days ago, the AP carried a story in  which Fidel Castro blamed the United  States for creating the huge market in  illegal drugs and said that we should  compensate  developing  nations  for  narcotics trafficking.  Castro's  assertion,  of  course,  absurd. I doubt that he would compen sate the United States-and especially  the people of Florida-for the cost of  holding his prisoners in our jails and  helping Cuban  refugees  start  new  lives.  I doubt he would compensate  the  United States and our Caribbean allies  for  freeing Grenada  from  Cuban  henchmen.  I doubt he would compensate those  countries  facing  Cuban  troops  in  Africa or Cuban-supported guerrillas  in Latin America.  I doubt he would compensate  the  citizens of Cuba for taking from them  their freedom, property, and country,  for splitting families and imprisoning  innocent men and women who  love  their country more than their person al liberty.  This simply  is another attempt by  Castro  to divert attention  from his  government's own involvement in drug  0 This symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g., 0  is 2:07 p.m.  Boldface type indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.  1407  24227  ",1985
1229,16,18,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman,  this amendment, which I believe is rel atively  uncontroversial,  cleared  by  both sides, simply would  reduce  the  authorized  level of Amtrak by 11.5  percent consistent with the appropria tions bill. The appropriations decision  that was reached last week in the De partment  of Transportation  appro priations, that is.  I believe  that  this  is  in  line with  fiscal responsibility. Let me just state  for  the  record  the  importance  that  this Member  feels,  as  the original  author of this bill of Amtrak, as a rail  passenger  service,  the  outstanding  qualities and services that it provides,  and I believe that this  is simply an  amendment that brings us closer  to  fiscal responsibility.

1235,16,18,Mr. LENT.,"  I  thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, as I understand this  amendment it does not actually reduce  Amtrak's funding any  further;  that  was done  last week during consider ation of the DOT appropriations bill.  Obviously, Amtrak cannot spend more  in Federal funds  then are appropri ated for it. So the gentleman's amend ment is not objectionable. I have no  objection.  ",1985
1236,16,18,Mr. RICHARDSON.,"  gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is ex actly correct in his representation.  ",1985
1237,16,18,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, it is my understand ing, and I stand to be corrected if I am  wrong, that this is an amendment that  cuts us back from the $616 million in  the committee bill  to $603.5 million  which is the amount agreed to on the  appropriations bill the other day. And  I think that that is a substantive im provement. It certainly gets us in the  direction that we ought to be going.  I must express, however, my disap pointment that we are not going  to  have  an  amendment  on  the  floor  which goes to the $582 million which  was the implied budget figure.  I  thank  the  I  I fully understand that we debated  that. The gentleman from New Mexico  who offered this amendment, in fact,  offered that amendment on the floor  the other day and it was defeated. So I  can understand the need to come back  to this figure.  But I do think it is important to rec ognize that we are engaged in a proc ess here of an authorization following  an appropriation and then taking the  implied  appropriation  figure which  just happens to be a figure above the  implied budget figure as being the au thorization figure.  You see what we are doing is, once  again we are figuring out a way to slip  around the budget process. That is my  concern, that we are doing that day  after day,  in way after way, on the  House floor.  I mean we are finding all kinds of  mechanisms to get around the budget.  Now, there are a number of us who  voted for that budget about 8 weeks  ago, 6 or 8 weeks ago, who did not par ticularly like the budget. As a matter  of fact, many of us recognized it to be  a phony, that there were all kinds of  phony figures in there, that the whole  thing was a sham and that it was the  only chance that we had of voting for  anything  that was going  to  try  to  target on some discipline in the House  of Representatives. It was the only dis ciplinary tool we were going to get.  So therefore some of us voted for it  as the only tool.  Now, despite  the fact  that it is a  sham, despite the fact that the figures  are phonies, we are finding ways on  the House floor day after day, in way  after way,  to even violate  the disci pline that is in that budget.  The question has to be, how much  longer are we going to allow this to go  on without at least admitting to the  American people that we are phonies,  that  this whole  process  is  a  total  sham?  Because what we did in the budget  on this particular program is, we said  flatly  in  the  budget,  the  implied  amount in the budget was $582 mil lion. We are now going to authorize  and appropriate a fund, an amount of  money which is $20 million above that  amount.  And we are going to say throughout  the pro~ess ""that everything is within  the budget, don't worry about it, and  so on, we have figured out another  way to get around the budget."" Then  someone else will bring a figure to the  floor and we will say that that gets  around the budget too.  And what that adds up to is that in  the  last 5 years Congress has over spent its own budgets by $150 billion.  That is how it is done. That is where  deficits come from. We overspend our  own budgets, and we do it very con sciously, and we do it on individual bill  after individual bill.  That is what we are doing here. We  are going to cut back a little bit on the  authorization, we are going to cut back  from $616 million  to $603.5 million,  but we are not going to get down to  the budget figure. In fact,  this com mittee is in a bind because they have  now found  themselves  in a situation  where, if they went to the $582 mil lion, the $582 million would not hold  up anyway because we have already  agreed to an appropriation which is a  figure above that. So the House is put  in a bind. The House cannot even get  down to the $582 million that a lot of  people like myself would like to see us  do.  I contend that that is,  in  large  part, the problem that is facing this  country today. Deficits are not born;  deficits are made. They are made right  here in the House of Representatives  on every occasion when we find a way  around the Budget Act.  In this bill today we are finding an other way around the Budget Act, and  we are doing it to the detriment of this  country because we are doing deficit  add-on, and we do it consciously.  I intend to support the gentleman's  amendment because  it moves  in the  right direction. I do not intend, howev er, to support this legislation because  it is a budget buster.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1985
1238,16,18,Mr. COATS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I  rise  in su9port of  the  amendment, briefly.  Mr. Chairman, I do rise in support of  the gentleman's amendment. As every one knows, we discussed this in the ap propriations process last week and ar rived at a figure constituting approxi mately 1.4-percent reduction in fund ing for Amtrak. There was disagree ment, frankly, as to whether we could  have gone further or not. The House  voted its will in that matter.  I think it is important to note, how ever, that those of us who do support  national rail passenger service,  those  of us who do support Amtrak, need to  pull together and continue to work to gether to find ways  to make  this a  more efficient, more effective rail pas senger service.  There are things that can be done to  accomplish this. There are a number  of things that were discussed in com mittee. There will be amendments of fered later in this process to deal with  some of those questions.  I would hope that we could continue  the process of making this a  leaner,  more efficient national rail system be cause, given  the budget reality of a  $200 billion deficit, spoken to by Mr.  WALKER from Pennsylvania and others  last week, it is critical that we examine  every program that the Federal Gov ernment involves itself in and do what ever we can to make those programs  more efficient.

Finally I would like to thank both  chairmen who are sitting over there;  the gentleman from Florida [Mr. PAs CELL] and the gentleman from Arizona  [Mr. UDALL]  for doing what many  people deemed was  impossible; with  the help of a lot of other people, but  without their leadership it would not  have been possible.

1249,29,18,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right to object, let me yield to the  gentleman from California.  ",1985
1250,29,18,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.,"  I  thank the  gentleman for yielding to me, and I  want to assure the gentleman that as I  understand the bill and the changes  that have been made  from what  before us today over what was here  several months ago;  if anything, this  costs the taxpayers less, because the  Senate took a pretty hard position on  some of the things that we have done  and some of those we have backed off  in reaching this agreement.  I would echo what  the gentleman  from Arizona said; the Kwajalein Mis sile Base is of extreme national securi ty  importance  to  this country, and  that arrangement runs out on Septem ber the 30th. It is absolutely vital that  this  legislation  passed  before  that  date.  I  do  not  know what  could  happen there; maybe we would be able  to extend it, maybe not; I just do not  know, but I think to play that kind of  a  game with our national  security  could be very damaging.  I would hope the gentleman would  withdraw his reservation.  ",1985
1251,29,18,Mr. WALKER.," I thank the various  gentlemen for their observations.  Let me make my point again, howev er, Mr. Speaker. Unanimous consent  implies  informed  consent. Now,  it  is  ",1985
1252,55,18,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, we have  a problem in the country. The prob lem is Federal spending because Fed eral spending has led us  to massive  budget  deficits. Those  deficits  and  that spending are driving us  toward  the  time when  the whole  series of  issues being addressed by  this Con gress will proliferate in magnitude to  where we will be unable to deal in a  meaningful way with  a  lot of  the  issues that we hear talked about from  day to day in this body.  We have just heard a very eloquent  discussion of  the  farm problems of  this country by the chairman of the  Agriculture  Committee.  The  farm  problem in this country is in large part  a problem which has accrued from the  deficit  problem,  from  the  Federal  spending problem.  0 1640  High interest rates on the farm have  done immense damage to the ability of  farmers to survive in the market econ omy, so therefore they have to come  to Washington suggesting that dealing  with that symptom, we need programs.  The  trade problem  that we  have  heard so much about comes  largely  from the fact that the dollar has risen  to such levels as the result of our defi cits here and the interest rates that  those deficits drive up, that foreign in vestors coming into this country have  in fact brought  their money out of  their homelands here and resulted in  the deficit problem. It has also result ed in the cost of our products overseas  going up, which again drives up the  trade problem.  Too often around here what we want  to deal with, we want  to deal with  those symptoms. We want to deal with  the farm problem as a singular item.  We want to deal with the trade prob lem as a singular item. We do not want  to deal with the basic item, spending,  the deficit.  You will hear most people  in  this  body go home  to their districts and  talk a lot about the deficit. My guess is  when we  were  home  during  the  August recess that there was no topic  talked about more by the Members of  this body as they talked to their con stituents  than  the deficit.  I assume  that every one of  them was saying,  ""Yes, indeed, I am in Washington. I  am going to address that problem."" It  is  something  that needs  to be  ad",1985
1253,81,18,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator from Arkansas. He  has  stated with his customary  elo quence the reason for supporting this  motion to recommit. There have been  a number of points he has made which  concur with. Because of our time con straints I would like to just very brief ly add ~ footnote to one point raised  by the Senator from Oklahoma on the  issue of whether or not Social Security  should be on or off the budget or re lated to it in some way in terms of  fiscal constraints on Federal spending.  Social Security presently has a surplus  and it is growing. In 10 years under  the  intermediate  economic  assump tions of the Social Security actuaries,  the Social Security's trust fund is ex pected to have a surplus of $500 bil lion. So if we keep Social Secur_ity in  the budget, we will have  less mce~­ tive-not more incentive-to constram  Federal spending on non-Social Securi ty programs. Therefore, you can turn  the argument of  the Senator  from  Oklahoma upside down, and say the  sooner we get it out of the budget, the  more likely we will be to have incen tive  to hold down spending on non Social Security programs.

1277,94,18,Mr.  SIMPSON.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Senator from California for  his moving remarks and for his sup port of the bill. He has been an ex traordinary participant.  I thank Senator KENNEDY, the rank ing member of the committee, Senator  SIMON, Senator HEINZ,  and Senator  CRANSTON for their willingness to take  the Social Security  issue  to a  new  place.  Mr. President, before the final vote  on S. 1200, I would like to make a few  concluding remarks.  First, I want to say to my colleagues  that  this bill  shows  that a  subject  which is so difficult in its moral impli cations and so complex in the interac tion of its numerous aspects can still  be dealt with fairly and openly-allow ing all points of view full access to the  public forum of the hearing process as  well as private contact with principals  and staff. It shows that such a subject  can be dealt with in a way which balances the very real needs of many in terest groups  in  this country-busi ness, labor,  heavily  impacted State  and  local  governments,  ~nd many  others-keeping paramount the funda mental obligation of all Members of  Congress, to serve the interests of the  American people as a whole and their  descendants.  Mr. President, S. 1200 contains, most  importantly,  provisions  intended  to  reduce the problem of illegal immigra tion. I say ""most importantly"" since  the potential benefits and protections  of even  the most carefully designed  statutory standards  for determining  who may enter the United States, as  well as for how long and under what  conditions they may remain, will not  be available in practice if those statu tory standards cannot be enforced.  Mr. President, the American people  want reform. Poll after poll discloses  that the American people overwhelm ingly wish to see illegal immigration  brought under control. Why is that?  In  these past several years,  I have  been involved in the discovery of the  significance of this fact, and I have  learned that the concern of the Ameri can people is well founded.  In my  supplemental statement  to  the final report of the Select Commis sion  on  Immigration  and Refugee  Policy, in my statements to this body  over the past 3 years, and elsewhere, I  have attempted  to discuss  the prob lems which must be solved. S. 1200 is  the proposed solution. It is the prod uct of so many, many persons over the  past 6 years-of all the faiths and phi losophies.  Mr. President, there can be no per fect immigration reform bill. We saw  that. We know  that. There are  so  many conflicting interests-special in terests conflicting with  the national  interest and with each other as well that it would truly take a miracle of a  kind we mortals are unwise to hope for  to accomplish and achieve a perfect  balance.  I do earnestly hope  that my col leagues will believe, however,  that I  have done my very damndest to follow  a procedure which provided the best  possible chance to produce a bill that  will serve the interests of our beloved  land and hear every view-that will  serve not only the interest of some or  even all of the generation now making  decisions for America, but the inter ests of their children and their chil dren's children-and  that will  serve  not only their economic interests but  all of the many and varied interests  which are part of what determines the  well-being of real live human beings citizens and those not so blessed.  So let me admit, Mr. President, that  we have not achieved perfection here  and that neither will we achieve per fection in the conference. But I think  we have done well. I remain proud of  the effort and I believe that all those  who have participated in drafting and  amending and improving it should feel  proud.  Mr. President,  I will  conclude by  saying to my colleagues that I  truly  believe that S. 1200 deserves their sup port-and not because of the work or  effort, or time expended to reach this  point. I ask them to support this bill if  they agree with me that it is a bal anced, well-intended and painstakingly  crafted proposal which, if enacted into  law, will promote the best interests of  the United States of America. I hope  that none of my colleagues will with hold his or her support-unless he or  she believes that S. 1200 does not pro mote the national interest, that it is  reasonable to expect that a different  and better bill could be passed in the  foreseeable future.  That is where we are.  ",1985

1280,120,18,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, when  the Committee on Environment and  Public Works reported S. 51, it recog nized that section 106 was an imper fect provision that would need addi tional attention. As reported, section  106  included  some  provisions  that  were designed to acquire information  to assess emissions and discharges of  hazardous substances to the environ ment and some provisions that were  designed  to  provide  information  to  emergency response authorities. This  combination tended to produce an un wieldy array of material for authori ties who needed something much sim pler.  The amendment the committee lead ership is introducing now replaces this  section with a more targeted inventory  of hazardous substances emissions and  discharges. Other amendments will ad dress the question of the information  and procedures to be required for an  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Re sponse Program.  A hazardous substances  inventory,  on a national scale, is a new and exten sive  undertaking.  Inventories  have  been used effectively by several States  for  regulatory purposes. A properly  constructed inventory can provide val uable  information  about  potential  emissions  that should be  regulated,  the effectiveness of regulations, and  trends in emissions over time. At issue  now is how to construct a national in ventory which  attempts  to balance  adequacy of information and the in herent demands on businesses that an  inventory poses when its uses are not  precisely  defined. This  amendment  changes several aspects of the commit tee bill to address this dilemma.  First, it limits the facilities subject  to the inventory to industries in the  manufacturing division of the stand ard industrial classification. These are  groups 20 through 39. Mr. President, I  ask unanimous consent that a listing  of these industries be printed in the  RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  REcoRD, as follows:  DIVISION D-MANuFACTURING  Major Group 20: Food and kindred products;  Major Group 21: Tobacco manufactures;  Major Group 22: Textile mill products;  Major Group 23: Apparel and other finished products made from fabrics and simi lar materials;  Major Group 24: Lumber and wood prod ucts, except furniture;  Major Group 25: Furniture and fixtures;  Major Group 26: Paper and allied prod ucts;  Major Group 27: Printing, publishing, and  allied industries;  leather  Major Group 28: Chemicals and allied  products;  Major Group 29: Petroleum refining and  related industries;  Major Group 30: Rubber and miscellane ous plastics products;  Major Group 31: Leather and  products;  Major Group 32: Stone, clay, glass, and  concrete products;  Major Group 33: Primary metal  tries;  Major Group 34: Fabricated metal prod ucts, except machinery and transportation  equipment;  Major Group 35: Machinery, except elec trical;  Major Group 36: Electrical and electronic  machinery, equipment, and supplies;  Major Group 37: Transportation equip ment;  Major Group 38: Measuring, analyzing,  and controlling instruments; photographic,  medical  and  optical  goods; watches  and  clocks; and  Major Group 39: Miscellaneous manufac turing industries.  indus ",1985
1281,120,18,Mr. BENTSEN.," Facilities in the SIC  groups  that manufacture or process  more than 200,000 pounds per year of  substances subject to the inventory or  that use more than 2,000 pounds per  year of  these  substances would  re spond to the inventory. Thus, a chemi cal plant manufacturing substances or  using  them  above  these  quantities  would be affected, but a dry-cleaner  would not.  Second, it more precisely focuses the  inventory  on  hazardous  substances.  While the committee-reported section  would cover any hazardous substance  under Superfund if it were more than  1 percent of a mixture, this proposal  looks at the substance itself. If a plant  used a product that was 1 weight per cent a hazardous substance, it would  have to use 200,000 pounds per year  before meeting  the 2,000-pound-per year reporting threshold for use.  Third,  the committee-reported bill  applied  to all substances defined as  hazardous under Superfund. This pro posal requires the President to estab lish a list of toxic chemical substances  which are manufactured or imported  into the United States in an aggregate  volume of more than 500,000 pounds  per year and are known to cause or are  suspected of causing, in humans, ad verse  acute  health  effects,  cancer,  birth defects, heritable genetic muta tions, or other health effects such as  reproductive dysfunction, neurological  disorder, or behavioral abnormalities,  or, because of toxicity, persistence, or  tendency to bioaccumulate in the envi ronment, may cause adverse environ mental effects. Until this list is pub lished,  specific chemicals defined as  hazardous under Superfund serve as  the list.  The President is given the authority  to establish different  thresholds for  particular chemicals based on his judg ment of their toxicity, extent of use,  or other factors. The President may  lower the threshold for other manuIf  facturing facilities in S.I.C. Codes 2039 based on such factors as toxicity of  the substance, proximity to other fa cilities that release the same substance  or to population centers, the history  of releases at a facility. For his State,  a Governor can request that addition al manufacturing  facilities  in S.I.C.  Codes 20-39 be added to the inventory.  The committee-reported bill would  have required the first inventory 180  days after enactment and additional  inventories  at  least  every  2  years  thereafter.  This  proposal  requires  three inventories: the first by June 30,  1987,  for  calendar  year  1986;  the  second by June 30, 1990, for calendar  year 1989; the third by June 30, 1993,  for calendar year 1992. There were  several reasons for these changes. It  allows ample opportunity for industry  to consider how to collect or estimate  its emissions during 1986 and an ade quate  time  to prepare  this data for  submission by mid-1987. There are 3  years between  inventories  to  reduce  the burden of preparing them and to  allow the recipients  to evaluate and  use the information they receive. Fi nally, Congress must act to continue  this  inventory  requirement.  it  proves to be a useless effort or U..'lrea sonably burdensome or poorly target ed, it will not continue beyond these  three submissions. If the information  is useful but needed more or less fre quently, Congress will have the oppor tunity to make such judgments and to  weigh these needs against their costs.  The information required has been  reduced one, to require annual quanti ties of materials known to be present  at a facility rather than annual and  monthly  quantity  information  and  two,  to  require general waste  treat ment information rather than detailed  information regarding such  items as  the location of di;;posal and the identi ty of  transporters. These are  items  more properly  related  to  regulatory  activities rather than inventories.  In preparing the inventory, a facility  may use readily available data collect ed pursuant to other State and Feder al environmental laws; or, where such  data are not readily available, reasona ble estimates may be used. In my view,  this inventory is created to try to de velop a reasonable sense of where haz ardous substances encounter the envi ronment. It attempts to create a loose  material balance of such substances. It  will be  imperfect. Consequently,  the  use of data required by State or Feder al  law  should be emphasized. Esti mates  are  equally  appropriate  and  techniques are available for such esti mates-many published by EPA and  other regulatory agencies. It is not the  intent of  this  inventory  to generate  massive monitoring and data collec tion efforts. In fact, nothing here shall  require the monitoring or actual meas urement of quantities of substances or  ",1985
1282,133,18,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to express my sincere thanks to  those Senators on the Judiciary Com mittee who have acted expediently on  Senate Joint Resolution 191. This res olution will help to shed light on the  problems that confront the 10 million  learning disabled of this country and  help open the door to greater knowl edge of the nature and causes of these  learning difficulties.  Along with my distinguished  col leagues who have cosponsored this res olution, I simply want to say that we  care about these children, and that we  also care about the many more who  may be suffering from  learning dis abilities but have not yet been diag nosed as such.  This October will hopefully prove to  be a significant turning point in the  history of rolling back the superstition  surrounding  learning  disabilities.  Great strides have been made since  the adoption of the Education for All  Handicapped Children Act  of  <Public Law 94-142). The programs  created by this law have served over  1.8 million  people  throughout  the  United States.  The term ""learning disability"" itself  is only 20 years old. Learning disabil ities are neurological problems  that  can impair a child's ability to perform  certain  tasks  that  require  accurate  perceptive skills. These are physiologi cal problems that in no way reflect a  child's intellectual capacity or poten tial. The learning disabled child en counters difficulty in linguistic skills  such as reading, writing, spelling, and  often in mathematics, concentration,  memory and symbolism. Regulations  that accompany Public Law  state that learning disabilities include  ""such conditions as perceptual handi caps, brain injury, minimal brain dys function, dyslexia, and developmental  aphasia.""  The Presidential Initiative on Adult  Literacy has documented the ongoing  problem of adult literacy in this coun try. These studies establish  that 60  million men and women in this coun try cannot read the front page of their  local  newspaper. The  link between  adult  illiteracy and  learning disabil ities has also been firmly ascertained.  We simply cannot allow today's learn ing disabled child  to become  tomor row's illiterate adult.  Before concluding,  I wish  to once  again acknowledge  the dedication of  my  distinguished  colleagues  in  the  94-142  House of Representatives who spon sored this resolution in that body-Mr.  GEORGE BROWN of California and JACK  KEMP of New York. Also, Mr. Presi dent, I would also like to extend my  praise for  the tireless efforts of the  many and varied organizations in this  country who have embraced this cause  and worked so hard  to  improve  the  lives of  the  learning disabled. This  praise  particularly  extends  to  the  Foundation for Children with Learn ing Disabilities, who gave much assist ance in seeing this resolution enacted  into law.  Mr. President,  those with  learning  disabilities can overcome their difficul ties. These problems do not have to be  tragic. October 1985,  is  the  time  to  interject hope and understanding into  the lives of those who have such dis abilities. With the designation of Octo ber as ""Learning Disabilities Aware ness Month"" we can bring down the  barriers that prevent the recognition  and  treatment of  these problems.  I  once again urge the Senate to adopt  this resolution.  The joint resolution was ordered to  be engrossed for a third reading, read  the third time, and passed.  The preamble was agreed to.  The joint resolution, with its pream ble, is as follows:  S.J.

1283,146,18,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join today with the distin guished junior Senator from Vermont  [Mr. LEAHY] to introduce the Electron ic Communications  Privacy Act  of  1985. With the drafting of this legisla tion, we take an important step in the  process of bringing our laws up to date  with modern technology. This bill ad dresses  itself  to  forms of electronic  communication that are new and un usual to many Americans. But the goal  of the legislation is a familiar and en during one: To protect the privacy of  Americans against unwanted and un warranted intrusion.  The stimulus for this legislation was  a hearing held in the Subcommittee  on Patents, Copyrights  and Trade marks last year, on the topic of com munications privacy. But  its genesis  really goes back much further in our  history. More than half a century ago,  Justice Louis Brandeis sounded an elo quent warning about the challenge to  privacy  posed  by  technological  ad vances. In his famous dissent in the  wiretapping case of Olmstead versus  United States, Brandeis  emphasized  that if the right to privacy is  to be  meaningful, it must be strong enough  to meet this challenge. As he put it:  The progress of science in furnishing the  government with means of espionage is not  likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may  someday be developed by which the govern ment, without removing papers from secret  drawers, can reproduce them in court, and  by which it will be enabled to expose to a  jury the most intimate occurrences of the  home.  That prospect must have appeared  fanciful to most of Brandeis' contem poraries. But we know better. Bran deis' ""someday"" has arrived, and the  law must respond.  Technological wizardry offers a vari ety  of new  communications media:  electronic mail, the cellular telephone,  local area networks, computer-to-com puter data  transmissions, and many  more.  Individuals and businesses are  taking advantage of these new ways to  share information of every kind and  description.  Some of  the messages  that  these  new media carry are highly sensitive.  A translation of the digital bits that  race across our country by wire, micro wave,  fiber optics  and other paths  could  reveal  proprietary  corporate  data, or personal medical or financial  information. The users of these net works-and that means more and more  of us-expect and deserve legal protec tion  against  unwarranted  intercep tions of this data stream, whether by  overzealous  law enforcement officers  or private snoops.  The laws on the books  today may  not  provide  that  protection.  The  major statutory bulwark against one  form  of  data  interception-wiretap ping-forbids only  the unauthorized  ""aural acquisition"" of wire communi cations. This definition does not fully  encompass the complex web of trans mission media that have become the  nervous system of our economy and  our society. Nor does it explicitly pro tect the growing volume of messages  that cannot be acquired ""aurally"" be cause, even  though they may be  in",1985

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION  PRIVACY ACT OF 1985  HON. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 1985  ",1985
1294,172,18,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, when  Congress passed the wiretap law 1  in 1968,  there was a clear consensus that telephone  calls should be private. Earlier Congresses  had reached that same consensus regarding  mail and telegrams.  But in the almost 20 years since Congress  last addressed the issue of privacy of com munications  in a  comprehensive  fashion,  the  technologies of communication  and  interception have changed dramatically.  Today we have large-scale electronic mail  operations,  cellular  and  cordless  tele phones, paging devices, miniaturized trans mitters for radio surveillance, light-weight  compact television cameras for video sur veillance, and a dazzling array of digitized  information  networks which were  little  more than concepts two decades ago.  These new modes of communication have  outstripped  the  legal protection provided  under statutory definitions bound by old  technologies. The unfortunate result is that  the same technologies that hold such prom ise for the future also enhance the risk that  our communications will be intercepted by  either private parties or the Government. 2  Virtually every day the press reports on the  unauthorized  interception  of  electronic  communications  ranging  from  electronic  mail and cellular telephones to data trans missions between computers. The commu nications industry is sufficiently concerned  about this issue to have begun the process  of seeking protective  legislation. This bill  is, in large part, a response to these legiti mate business concerns.  Congress needs to act to ensure that the  new technological equivalents of telephone  calls, telegrams and mail are afforded the  same protection provided  to conventional  ' Title III of  the Omnibus Crime Control and  Safe Streets Act of 1968.  2 According to a soon to be released study of this  question by the Office of Technology Assessment,  Federal agencies are planning to use or already use  closed circuit TV surveillance (29 agencies>. radio  scanners (20 agencies>, cellular telephone intercep tion <6 agencies>. tracking devices <15 agencies>. pen  registers <14 agencies), and electronic mail intercep tions (6 agencies>. This increased use of a variety of  electronic surveillance devices alone is not cause for  alarm. There are instances when a particular elec tronic surveillance technique is necessary to com plete a criminal investigation, as my bill recognizes.  September 19, 1985  communications. The  situation we  face  today was clearly foreseen by Justice Bran deis in 1928 when he said:  Time works changes, brings into existence  new conditions and purposes. Therefore a  principle  to be vital must be capable of  wider application than the mischief which  gave it birth ...  The progress of science in furnishing the  government with means of espionage is not  likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may  some day be developed by which the govern ment, without removing papers from secret  drawers, can reproduce them in court, and  by which it will be enabled to expose to a  jury the most intimate occurrences of the  home.  The makers of our Constitution under took to secure conditions favorable  to the  pursuit of happiness. They recognized the  significance of man's spiritual nature, of his  feelings and of this intellect ... They con ferred as against the government the right  to be let alone-the most comprehensive of  rights and the right most valued by civilized  men.3  WHAT IS AT STAKE  Without legislation addressing the prob lems of electronic communications privacy,  emerging industries may be stifled. For ex ample,  recent court decisions concerning  cellular and cordless telephones leave a se rious question whether calls made over  those systems are truly private. Similarly  the current law with respect to the inter ception of digitized  information  over  a  common carrier telephone line is unclear.  This type of uncertainty may unnecessarily  discourage potential customers from using  such systems. More importantly this ambi guity may encourage unauthorized users to  obtain access to communications to which  they are not party.  In addition  to  the commercial disloca tions which may occur if we do not act to  protect the privacy of our citizens, we may  see the gradual erosion of a precious right.  Already the very same communication be tween two persons is subject to widely dis parate legal treatment depending on wheth er the message was carried by regular mail,  electronic mail, an analog phone line, a cel lular phone or some other form of elec tronic communication  system. This  tech nology-dependent legal approach does not  adequately  protect  personal  communica tions;  rather,  it  imperfectly affords  legal  protection  to communications carried by  some industries. Nor does this crazy quilt  of laws reflect the centrality of American's  privacy concerns. As  recent polls clearly  show, Americans care about privacy inter ests. 4 As one commentator put it:  Privacy  is not  just one possible means  among others to insure some other value,  but ... it is necessarily related to ends and  relations of the most fundamental sort: re spect, love, friendship and trust. Privacy is  not merely a good technique for furthering  3 Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 474  (1928> <Brandeis, J. dissenting>.   According to a 1984 poll, 77 percent of Ameri cans are concerned about technology's threats to  their personal privacy.

1296,185,18,Mr. HERTEL of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I  think  it  is only proper and  fitting  that  during National Newspaper Week (Septem ber 15-21, 1985) we take a moment to rec ognize the tremendous service of our Na tion's  newspaper  network.  Newspapers  serve an important function in our society:  Transmitting information about the econo my, politics, human interest, and communi ty events, just to name a few.  The Grosse Pointe News, a community  paper  located  in  the 14th Congressional  District which I represent, published an ar ticle  especially  for National Newspaper  Week entitled, ""Newspapers: They're Every body's Business,""  by Nancy Parmenter,  which describes the role of this particular  paper during  its 45-year history  in  the  Grosse Pointe community. I want to share  excerpts  from  this article with my col leagues to demonstrate the importance of  the many services provided by such news papers.  EXCERPTS FROM THE GROSSE POINTE NEWS  The Grosse Pointe News never neglected  the role it prides itself on today-that of  community booster. Pages were devoted to  high school sports and community events.  Economic development, fire and police pro tection and school news  filled  the pages,  crowding even news of the war in Europe.  If there were no Grosse Pointe News, you  wouldn't know who got married, had a baby,  or died. Local merchants would have no  outlet  for  their ads and business would  drop. You would have had  to depend on  word-of-mouth  to  find out when  school  opened.        You depend on the Grosse Pointe News  for  information on community meetings.  School sports. The level of Lake St. Clair.  Those  fantastic classified ads. And we've  been cranking that information out for 45  years.  Today the Grosse Pointe News has seven  writers. We cover the police and fire beats  in all five Pointes twice a week and attend  every municipal meeting, but  the biggest  part of our coverage is still the community.  Detailing the efforts and successes of its in dividuals is the paper's way of taking an ac curate community pulse. It's a record of the  rhythms of life from birth to death.                  ",1985
1297,198,18,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, yes terday marked an important occasion  for America's national security. Yes terday the seventh Trident submarine,  the USS Alaska, went out to sea for  the first time. It will still be awhile  before she  is  fully operational, but  she's well on the way. I have long sup ported the Trident program and am  pleased that it is progressing well.  But also worthy of note is that yes terday marked the beginning of the  dismantling of an older Poseidon sub marine, the USS Sam Rayburn. The  is  in port,  its missile  doors have been opened and removed,  and  the Poseidon missiles  it carries  have been removed. This is the first  time that the United States has dis mantled  an  operational  strategic  weapon to comply with an arms con trol agreement. And we are stronger  because of it.  We are stronger because our com mitment to stay within the limits of  existing  SALT  agreements  is  very  much in our national interest. The So viets have already dismantled several  hundred nuclear missiles  to comply  with SALT, a fact that might shock  some of my colleagues. Had we decided  to ignore that limit, the Soviets would  have had no reason to stay within the  numerical limits either, and then the  arms race would have really taken off.  President Reagan decided  in June  that we would take this step, and I  highly commend him for his decision.  This was one of the best decisions he  has made since he took office, and I  know it wasn't easy to do this, given  how hard he attacked SALT II during  the 1980 Presidential campaign. It is a  tribute to him that he was able to look  beyond the rhetoric and choose  the  path that best serves U.S. security in terests.  The whole framework which limits  the superpowers' offensive weaponry  is very shaky  indeed. SALT II was  never ratified and the offensive limits  of SALT I expired nearly 8 years ago.  The basis for even the modest limits of  these  agreements  staying  in  place  rests upon unilateral policy statements  made by each side. Not only do neither  of these have the force of law, but the  wording used in each is not the same.  This fragile framework is a dangerous  way to keep the lid on the arms race.  This is why I believe that despite the  pessimism of  the President and his  people  about  the  prospects  for  progress  in  arms  control  at  the  summit, the area of preserving exist ing restraints on offensive arms while  negotiations for a new agreement are  underway is one where real progress  can be made. This is why three of my  colleagues, Senators LEAHY, CHAFEE,  and HEINZ, and I have sent a letter to  the President encouraging him to ex plore this issue with Mr. Gorbachev in  November in Geneva. I ask unanimous  consent that a copy of this letter be  printed at the conclusion of my re marks here today.  Mr. President, the President and his  advisers have  stated publicly many  times that it will probably be several  years  before  a  new  agreement  is  reached. Thus for the next few years,  the name of the game in arms control  is holding on to what we have, and  that means SALT I and SALT II. De spite our concerns about Soviet com pliance with SALT, it still provides a  good basis  for an  interim  restraint  regime, as the President recognized in  June.  Unfortunately, the way the situation  is now, we will face a new period of un certainty on the U.S. side as we ap proach the next watershed mark late  next spring, when the eighth Trident  sub, the USS Nevada, goes out to sea  trials, and when we exceed  the 120  limit for cruise-missile-equipped heavy  bombers. Let's put our policy on a  firmer footing and ensure that the So viets do the same. This is why I en courage  the President  to  raise  the  issue of interim restraint policy with  Mr. Gorbachev in Geneva, and work  out a way to preserve at least some  limits while negotiations  for a new  agreement are underway.  I would also personally suggest to  the President that he consider propos ing modest cuts in the SALT limits to  the Soviets, so that at least some re ductions can proceed in the next few  years. The United States would have  nothing to lose but a few vulnerable  Minuteman missiles, while the Soviets  would have  to cut hundreds, across  the board,  including  some of  their  giant SS-18's. But if this would be too  much,  then at least  let's nail down  what we have and put our interim re straint policy on a surer foundation.  America's security  interests demand  no less.  I ask unanimous consent that a table  describing United States and Soviet  dismantling requirements be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  COMMI'ITEE ON APPROPRIATIONS,  Washington, DC, September 18, 1985.  President RONALD W. REAGAN,  The White House,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We are writing to ex press our strong support for your decision to  meet with Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva  in November and to urge that arms control  have a high priority in your agenda for the  talks. This meeting provides an important  opportunity for both sides to overcome the  stalemate in the Geneva negotiations, dis cuss  fundamental  U.S.  concerns  about  Soviet compliance with arms control obliga tions, and consider ways to halt the erosion  in existing restraints.  You and your advisers have counseled  caution about expectations for the outcome  of this meeting. We believe, however, that  there is the potential for agreement on at  least one important aspect of arms control:  interim restraint policy.  We firmly agree with your declaration on  June 10 that ""despite the Soviet record over  the last years, it remains in our interest to  establish an  interim  framework of  truly  mutual restraint on strategic offensive arms  as we pursue . . . the ongoing negotiations  in Geneva"". Your June decision to disman tle a Poseidon submarine when  the USS  Alaska goes to sea trials was an important  initiative that enhances U.S. security inter ests and forms the basis to strengthen the  interim restraint regime at the summit. It is  clearly in our interest to keep the Soviets  from exceeding the SALT II MIRV ceilings  and SALT I submarine limits, which they  currently are observing.  While we all remain hopeful for a new  arms agreement soon, we agree with your  assessment  that  it could well be  several  years before a new agreement is  reached.  Accordingly, it is important that the exist ing interim framework be strengthened to  last  until  such  an  agreement  can  be  reached. A breakdown of these limits would  only accelerate  the arms competition and  damage U.S. security interests.  While both the U.S. and the Soviet Union  have made unilateral statements at differ ent times regarding their interim restraint  policy, there has been no joint agreement  on this vitally  important issue. Given the  similarity in the public statements made by  both sides, agreement on a common position  should be possible. This could also be joined  by language dealing with avenues for resolv ing concerns about compliance with specific  aspects of existing agreements.  We encourage you  to pursue and seek  agreement on the issue of interim restraint  policy with Secretary Gorbachev in your up",1985
1298,211,18,Mr. HELMS.," And what the Senator  is experiencing is the predictable con sequence of trying to solve problems  by throwing excessive amounts of the  taxpayers' money at the problems.  The point  is-and  the Senator  is  aware of this-most of the money ex pended for Superfund has not been  spent on cleaning up hazardous waste  sites. Far from it. More than $117 mil lion, for example, has been spent on  litigation costs alone. Paying the law yers, who just love legislation like this.  So the Superfund, as I said earlier,  might well be regarded as a  lawyers'  relief fund, not really as a mechanism  to do very much to protect the public  health.  Thats why I am cosponsoring the  pending amendment offered by Sena tor SYl\rfMs  to save the taxpayers $1.8  billion by reducing the Superfund re authorization fund $7.5 billion to $5.7  billion. I predicate my cosponsorship  of this amendment on the fact that of ficials of the Environmental Protec tion Agency, themselves, have repeat edly stated that  the Agency simply  cannot spend $7.5 billion in an effec tive and prudent manner.  So what is afoot, here? If an agency  assigned to administering the expendi tures of funds says to Congress, ""We  cannot  spend  this  much  money  wisely,"" what is the sense in forcing  upon them more money than they can  spend wisely?  In a March 15, 1984, hearing on Su perfund, Mr. Lee M. Thomas, who was  then the Assistant Administrator-he  is  now  the  EPA Administrator warned,  ""Additional  infusions""-of  funding beyond EPA's capabilities ""could have a paradoxical effect on re tarding our  activities, not  speeding  them up."" He added that ""too great a  rate has the potential for promoting  fiscal waste.""  If ever a  soul  in the bureaucracy  stated a fact clearly, Mr. Thomas did  on that occasion.  Then we move up to July 18 of this  year. EPA Director Thomas-he had  by then taken over as Administrator reiterated his position, and he pointed  to a number of  important consider ations: First, he said,  the technical/  legal restraints at EPA hinder EPA's  ability effectively  to manage a pro gram greater than $5.3 billion. That is  the reason why my original amendment specified reducing the funding  for Superfund to $5.3 billion. Accord ing to Mr. Thomas, there is currently  inadequate capacity to properly treat,  store, or dispose of hazardous wastes.  There  are  presently  few  facilities  which meet the technical standards es tablished under the Resources Conser vation and Recovery Act [RCRAl. In  addition, he says that land disposal re strictions established under the 1984  RCRA  amendments  limit  options  available  for disposing of hazardous  wastes.  Second, Mr. Thomas stated that al though there are a number of develop ing  technologies  for  the permanent  treatment and/or destruction of haz ardous wastes,  the commercial avail ability of these technologies is quite  limited. This  lack of sufficient com mercially available technologies could  limit the extent to which the pace of  the program could be increased.  Third, Mr. Thomas stated that EPA  just does not have  the staff, space,  equipment, or administrative support  to handle a $7.5 billion Superfund Pro gram.  Mr. President, despite this warning  from EPA and Superfund's failure to  clean up hazardous waste sites, there  are those who would turn a deaf ear to  reality. Instead, they have embraced  the theory that throwing more money  at the project, almost $6 billion more  than currently authorized, will make  everything better, that somehow more  money will make more cleanup.  I find myself wondering if we are not  on a slippery slope of throwing money  at a problem when the money would  simply be wasted.  Mr. President, the folks back home  hear a lot of rhetoric about reducing  the deficit and reducing Government  spending. If Senators are really seri ous about getting Government spend ing under control, we should not reau thorize Superfund at more than $5.7  billion. We should save the $1.8.  The  line  is drawn. The choice  is  clear. We can either be fiscally respon sible and have the courage to say no to  Government  overspending  and  do  what is right for the American people,  or we can bow  to pressure  interest  groups.  I commend Senator SYMMS for offer ing this amendment to reduce the re authorization level of Superfund from  $7.5 billion to $5.7 billion and I urge  my colleagues to support him by co sponsoring this measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the July 18, 1985, letter from  Lee Thomas, Administrator of  the  EPA, be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION AGENCY,  Washington, DC, July 18, 1985.  Hon. JESSE A HELMs,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.

Contained  in that proposal  is an amend ment which would increase the size of the  Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund  <Fund), which finances the Superfund pro gram, from the current $1.6 billion to $5.3  billion over the next five years.  The Administration believes that a $5.3  billion Fund is the maximum amount the  Environmental Protection Agency  <EPA>  could effectively manage during the next  five year reauthorization period. The Ad ministration believes a $5.3 billion Fund,  combined with a strong enforcement pro gram which is expected to yield over $2 bil lion worth of private party cleanup through  1990, would enable EPA to effectively ad dress the hazardous substance release prob lem over the next five years.  As you know, Congress is currently consid ering two major bills to amend CERCLA.  These bills, S. 51 and H.R. 2817, would in crease the size of the Fund to $7.5 billion  and $10 billion, respectively. The Adminis tration believes there would be serious prob leiDS in managing a program of that magni tude and would support any effort to reduce  those levels of authorization to $5.3 billion.  The Administration believes there are sig nificant  constraints which  could  hinder  EPA's ability to effectively manage a pro gram greater than $5.3 billion. The follow ing highlights those constraints.  TECHNICAL LEGAL CONSTRAINTS  There is currently inadequate capacity to  properly treat, store, or dispose of hazard ous wastes. Two factors related to landfill  capacity will continue  to exacerbate  this  problem. First,  there  are presently  few  double-lined facilities which meet the tech nical standards established under the Re source Conservation  and Recovery Act  <RCRA>. Second, the land disposal restric tions  established under  the 1984 RCRA  amendments limit options available for dis posing of hazardous wastes. These factors  could slow the pace of cleanup in the short term until additional capacity or alternative  disposal methods become available.  TREATMENT/PERKANENT TECHNOLOGY  CONSTRAINTS  There are a number of developing tech nologies for the permanent treatment and/  or destruction of hazardous wastes. These  technologies include incineration as well as  biological  and  cheinical  degradation  of  wastes. Although some of  these  technol ogies have been proven  to be  technically  feasible, commercial availability is quite lim ited. As the demand for permanent treat ment and/or destruction of wastes increases  in the next few years,  the availability of  permanent  technologies  should  improve.  However, in the short-term, the lack of suf ficient commercially available technologies  could limit the extent to which the pace of  the program could be increased.  MANAGERIAL CONSTRAINTS  The Superfund program has grown rapid ly over the past five years. Rapid growth  makes effective management difficult. Ex",1985
1299,224,18,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise to  offer an amendment to S. 51, the Su perfund  Improvement Act  of  This amendment is based on a bill I in troduced in April 1985, S. 892, ""The  Mixed Hazardous Waste Amendment  Act of 1985.""  The primary purpose of this legisla tion is to clarify the intent of Congress  that  the generation,  transportation,  treatment, and storage of hazardous  waste mixed with radioactive materials  is subject to the Solid Waste Disposal  Act.  In particular,  the  amendment  clarifies the intent of Congress that  the disposal of hazardous waste mixed  with radioactive materials at Depart ment of Energy Atomic Energy Act fa cilities, and at other facilities not li censed for the disposal of radioactive  materials is subject to the Solid Waste  Disposal Act.  Mr. President, I am aware that the  Environment and Public Works Com mittee has attempted to deal with the  general issue of mixed waste regula ton, and that there have been difficul ties  in  resolving  the  question  of  Agency jurisdiction, particularly with  respect to NRC licensed facilities. This  amendment avoids  this problem by  specifically dealing only with DOE  Atomic Energy Act facilities and by  being specifically neutral on the regu lation of  the disposal of hazardous  waste  at State-licensed  or NRC-li censed facilities.  The amendment is needed because  some officials  in the Department of  Energy have indicated that there is, in  their view, some ambiguity in the leg islative history of RCRA as far as the  regulation of mixed hazardous waste  at DOE defense sites. I do not believe  Congress intended any ambiguities in  this area, and so I am introducing this  amendment.  The need to clarify this regulatory  authority has been graphically illus trated by the recent series of events at  the Feed Materials Production Center  in Fernald, OH. The Fernald plant  which manufactures uranium billets metal ingots, for our nuclear produc tion reactors, was constructed in 1951  and became fully operational in 1954.  Owned by DOE, the Fernald facility is  one of a number of plants throughout  the United States owned by the Gov ernment and operated under contract.  Documents released by the contrac tor, National Lead of Ohio [NLOl and  DOE show that an estimated 5 million  kilograms  of  uranium  and mixed  wastes have been buried on the Fer nald plant property in rubber or clay  lined pits on the 1,050 acre site. Al though the lining of the pits is de signed to prevent leakage, unusually  high concentrations of uranium have  been found in wells south of the plant.  In addition to the storage pits, there  are drums of hazardous waste on site.  Some of the drums have leaked haz ardous waste  into  a  nearby  storm  sewer. While this situation has been  corrected, no action was taken by DOE  until EPA discovered  the  situation  during  a  routine  inspection  under  RCRA. More appalling still is the fact  that DOE has been monitoring well  water off-site only since 1981.  Unfortunately, the situation at Fer nald is not unique for these facilities.  DOE's preferred method for disposing  of this waste has been to dump solid  hazardous and mixed waste into open  sc.  trenches or burial grounds. In 1983,  seepage ponds at DOE's Oak Ridge,  TN, facility were found to be leaking  metal plating wastes, acids and organic  solvents into groundwater at a rate of  4.7 million gallons per year. Evidence  of similar contamination has surfaced  at other major DOE facilities such as  the Savannah River plant in Aiken,  For  this  reason  I  have  requested  GAO  to  investigate  eight  separate  plants around the country. That inves tigation is underway now and we are  expecting a  report on  this by very  early next year.  The bill before us, SSI, addresses the  cleanup  industrial  sites.  However,  there are also a significant number of  Government-operated sites  that face  environmental threats and should be  addressed.  I  believe  that  the Secretary  of  Energy and other applicable Federal  agencies should request an adequate  funding level in their appropriations  to clean up sites that threaten human  health and the environment. The Gov ernment  has  the  responsibility  to  clean up sites it owns just as industry  is called up to pay for its contribution.  Mr. President, I urge DOE as they  read the RFCORD of our debate to make  certain next year's budget request con tains an adequate  funding  for  this  cleanup. Examples of DOE sites  in  this category are, for instance, Savan nah River, SC, Oak Ridge, TN; Rocky  Flats  in Colorado;  and Hanford  in  Washington. I am pleased to see new  awareness of this problem and to see  that the Secretary of Energy, Mr. Har rington recently announced that he is  appointing a new Assistant Secretary  for Environment Safety and Health to  investigate into this situation. I urge  the Secretary of Energy to ensure that  this new position carries the necessary  authority to aggressively cleanup sites  and  to present  the creation of new  sites.  Mr. President, I further believe that  this amendment will be a significant  step forward in correcting a number of  problems which  currently  exist  in  America  as  nuclear  facilities-prob lems that have developed both because  we were not as sensitive as we should  have been on the issue of health and  safety and because DOE in the past  with 20-20 hindsight being what it is  was over-zealous in encouraging nucle ar production and under-zealous-not  zealous enough-in dem~mding envi ronmental protection.  As a society we know better. There fore, although plants like Fernald are  essential to the security of our country  we must see to it that the cost of that  security does not include the health of  our people.  So I urge support for  ment.  this amend ",1985

1305,237,18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to support  S.  51,  legislation  reauthorizing  the  Hazardous Substance Response Trust  Fund or Superfund.  Senator  STAFFORD  and  the other  members of the Committee on Envi ronment and Public Works are to be  commended for their efforts to reau thorize  and  improve  our Nation's  system of responding to the problem  of hazardous waste.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency estimates that there are now  some 20,000 or more hazardous waste  sites in the United States. And that  number  is  growing every day. The  problem is enormous.  Critics charge that we  in Congress  often  respond  to problems of  such  magnitude with  a  pitchfork and  a  truck load of million dollar bills. Such  is not the case with Superfund.  Properly  disposing  of  hazardous  waste and cleaning up potentially dan gerous Superfund sites require careful ly and scientifically planned action.  Eliminating the threat to our environ ment by hazardous wastes is not a mis sion which money alone can accom plish.  Over the last 4 years Congress has  judiciously raised and spent $1.6 bil lion  to begin our national effort  to  identify  and  clean  up  hazardous  wastes. That money has been spent  not only on cleaning up specific sites,  but on developing methodologies and  practices  for  fighting  hazardous  wastes in the future.  On September 30, 1986, the author ity of Congress to raise revenues and  appropriate moneys to support Super fund will  expire. The Environment  and Public Works Committee and the  Senate Finance Committee have  reported the legislation which is before  us today to expand and improve the  Superfund.  Some $7.5 billion would be  raised  mainly through excise taxes to broad en our attack on hazardous waste. The  lessons of the last 4 years now enable  us to expand this campaign. New sci entific advances have been made. Su perfund is more efficient and the two  most  recent Administrators  of  the  EPA have told Congress that Super fund workers are ready to take on this  problem on a larger scale.  I doubt that there is one Member of  this body or of the House of Repre sentatives who does not support Su perfund, and who does not support in creasing its efforts, in light of the new  proficiency we have  in dealing with  hazardous wastes. There is some con sternation, however,  concerning  the  funding mechanism which the Senate  Finance Committee approved on May  23, 1985.  For the past 4 years, Superfund has  been financed,  in  large part, by an  excise tax on petrochemicals. Indeed,  the so-called feedstock tax on 42 desig nated chemicals has provided seven eighths of Superfund moneys  since  1981.  In May, the Environment and Public  Works Committee sent legislation to  the Finance Committee requiring that  $7.5 billion in revenues be raised over  the next 5 years to finance Superfund.  After  careful  consideration  and  debate, the Finance Committee recom mended  that  the  feedstocks  tax be  continued, and that a new tax on man ufacturers be imposed.  The manufacturers excise tax, which  would raise $5.4 billion, would be im posed at a rate of $8 for every $10,000  earned from the sale or lease of prop erty. This  tax would only apply  to  firms with  taxable receipts of more  than $5 million. There would be no tax  on exports and manufacturers would  be allowed to take a tax credit for the  amount by which the excise  tax  in creases the cost of their purchases.  In its report accompanying the Su perfund  legislation,  the Senate Fi nance Committee argued that the new  manufacturers excise tax would broad en the tax base which supports Super fund. Under current law only approxi mately 600 firms are footing the bill  for Superfund. Albeit, these firms are  some of the producers of hazardous  waste. Under the legislation before us,  some 32,000 firms would share the cost  of the expanded Superfund effort.  The business community has been  very critical of the Finance Commit tee's manufacturers excise tax, claim ing that it is a hidden value added tax.  The cost of Superfund, they say, will  ultimately be passed on to consumers  in the form of higher prices. In addi tion, they argue that the current feed stock tax only taxes those who direct ly  produce  potentially  hazardous  wastes, while the new manufacturers  tax would unfairly tax all larger firms.  Yet, the Finance Committee has in cluded provisions which allow Ameri can manufacturers to remain competi tive in the world economy, by exempt ing exports from the tax. Additionally,  no one industry in the chain of pro duction of a product would be forced  to bear the full burden of the excise  tax, because a tax credit will be made  available equal to the increased pur chase  price which  a manufacturer  must pay as a result of excise taxes im posed at earlier points in production.  I too have serious reservations about  value added taxes of any kind. But, I  have no doubts, whatsoever, about the  need to increase our efforts to clean  up hazardous wastes. I, for one, want  to make it clear that today I am cast ing my vote for Superfund, not for  value added taxes.  Any effort at this point to strike the  funding mechanism for Superfund ap proved by the Senate Finance Com mittee only serves to distract us from  our central purpose, which is to renew  and improve Superfund.  The battle over the funding mecha nism for Superfund was won or lost,  depending on your perspective, in the  Finance Committee. Any attempt now  to rewrite the tax aspects of the Su perfund legislation would cause an un necessarily protracted debate to occur.  If Superfund were not about to expire,  if the problem were not so immediate,  perhaps we could afford to hold such a  debate.  But, there is no time. The threat of  hazardous waste increases every day,  and we are doing all we can right now  to keep up with it. President John F.  Kennedy  understood  this  situation  well. In 1963 he wrote to Congress:  Actions deferred are all too often opportu nities lost, particularly in safeguarding our  natural resources.  I urge my colleagues to support and  approve with dispatch the Superfund  Improvement Act of 1985.  ",1985
1306,237,18,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President, I want  to express my strong support for pas sage of S. 51, the Superfund Improve ment Act of 1985. This is a bill of ex treme importance to the health and  welfare  of millions  of Americans  whose homes are near the site of dan gerous  toxic waste  dumps.  I  am  pleased that the leadership has recog nized the need to complete work on  this bill as soon as possible so that we  can move toward final action on this  critical reauthorization bill.  For those of us who have not experi enced  the  fear  and  apprehension  which comes with living near or on top  of a hazardous waste site, the emotion al depth of such feelings is difficult to  comprehend. It is, however, very real  and  cannot  be  dismissed  lightly.  Across the State of Maine, from Saco  to Washburn, we have experienced the  ",1985
1307,263,18,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President,  I  was contacted a year ago by the direc tor of a freestanding radiation therapy  center in Arkansas. He came to see me  because  the  freestanding  radiation  therapy center doesn't fit neatly into  the prospective payment system. We  have  tried  through  administrative  channels to achieve some recognition  of the special role of community radi ation therapy centers and the need for  a fair reimbursement mechanism for  the centers, but we have been unsuc cessful.  I am here today to introduce a meas ure which will exempt freestanding ra diation therapy centers from the DRG  system and allow them to bill directly  for  their services  to Medicare  inpa tients  through part B of Medicare.  This measure will provide fair reim bursement to the freestanding centers  but will not allow the centers to re quest additional payment from benefi ciaries. There will be no  increase in  the out-of-pocket costs of beneficiaries  who receive these services.  Prior  to  the prospective payment  system,  community  therapy centers  were allowed to bill directly for serv ices to Medicare inpatients under part  B of Medicare. Under the new prospec tive payment system, Medicare reim burses hospitals for services provided  to inpatients who are Medicare benefi ciaries.  freestanding  radiation  therapy  center  provides  radiation  treatment to a Medicare inpatient, the  clinic must contract with the hospital  for payment for  those services. The  hospital has to take some of its lump  sum DRG payment and pass it on to  the radiation center in payment for  the center's services to the patient.  That arrangement seems reasonable  enough, but in fact it is causing seri ous problems for freestanding centers.  We all know  the cost of caring for  cancer patients in hospitals is some times extremely high because of the  length of stay or the treatment that is  required. Hospitals  sometimes  find  themselves receiving inadequate Medi care  reimbursement  for  treating  If a  cancer patients and still being asked to  share that sum with radiation centers.  And the centers, which are dispropor tionately dependent on Medicare due  to the patient population they serve,  find  themselves  settling  for  inad equate payment.  In addition, the freestanding centers  treat a  large number of indigent pa tients, and charity and bad debt allow ances are high. These facts make the  change  to  the prospective payment  system especially difficult for the free standing centers.  If we were simply talking about a  system that trimmed the profits of the  free-standing centers I would tell the  centers that was the unfortunate but  necessary result of the pressing need  to implement Medicare cost contain ment measures. I am afraid, however,  that these changes threaten to end a  cost effective method of providing ra diation therapy to hospital inpatients.  In the State of Arkansas, freestand ing clinics provide radiation therapy  services for most of the State. This ar rangement has worked very well in the  past. Because  the centers  treat pa tients from across the State, they pro vide a wide range of services in addi tion to cost effective radiation ther apy, including counseling services for  their patients and transportation for  inpatients from hospitals to the cen ters. These  centers have  the best  equipment  and  support  technology  available as well as highly trained ra diation therapy specialists. Hospitals  and physicians have been pleased with  this arrangement because it has pre vented large capital outlays by several  hospitals simply to duplicate radiation  therapy services.  The  freestanding centers and  the  hospitals  devised  a  cost  effective  system for providing radiation therapy  long before the Congress came along  to  implement  a  cost  containment  system. It is now the prospective pay ment system which threatens to undo  the efficient radiation therapy system  that has developed in Arkansas.  Already in several areas of the coun try, hospitals which had depended on  freestanding centers are now deciding  to invest in in-house radiation centers.  There are real questions about wheth er each and every hospital can provide  the type services a regional center can  provide, and there are serious ques tions about the costs to our Nation in  the long run if hospitals begin to du plicate these expensive radiation serv ices.  I know that I will be told that this  measure is going to cost the Medicare  system and that isn't feasible. But I  feel that this measure is an example of  cost containment at its best. If the  freestanding centers are not adequate ly reimbursed, there is a danger the  centers won't be able to provide serv ices to Medicare inpatients. We could  see a proliferation of radiation therapy centers in hospitals, an expensive  duplication of services, and a decline  in the quality of services available to  cancer patients. That result is clearly  contrary to our efforts to contain med ical  care  costs and provide quality  health care to Medicare beneficiaries.  Mr. President, this is a modest but  important bill. I commend it to my col leagues, and urge the Finance Com mittee to schedule hearings on it as  soon as possible.e  (for himself  By Mr. NICKLES  and Mr. BoRENs):  S. 1684.

1308,263,18,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I rise  today, with the support of my distin guished colleague Senator BoREN,  to  introduce legislation that represents a  culmination of 5 year's work and nego tiation by six Oklahoma Indian Tribes.  legislation would complete  the  Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's intent  to arrange the transfer in trust of the  Chilocco Indian School lands to the  Cherokee Nation and the Five Tribes  of  the Pawnee Agency,  these  tribes  being  the  Kaw,  Otoe-Missouria,  Pawnee, Ponca, and Tonkawa Indian  Tribes of Oklahoma.  Under  Public  Law  the  Bureau of Indian Affairs was given the  authority to dispose of the Chilocco  Indian School  lands. Subsequently,  the associate solicitor for Indian af fairs determined the Public Law 93only  qualified  the  Cherokee  Nation of Oklahoma as transferee of  the Chilocco School lands. Therefore,  the associate solicitor determined, par titionment of the land by the Chero kee Nation to the Five Tribes of the  Pawnee Agency would violate the Non Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177). Ac cordingly, the purpose of this legisla tion is to authorize the United States  to hold the Chilocco School Lands in  trust for the Cherokee Nation of Okla homa  and  the Five Tribes of  the  Pawnee Agency.

This  morning,  television  and newspapers  were full of pictures, full of words that  describe that tragedy, or sought to do  so.  Forces beyond our comprehension  have been unleashed with a cruelty  which beggars our imagination. One of  the world's oldest,  and  justifiably  proudest, civilizations has been struck  a body blow-and anyone with blood  in his veins or a heart in his chest  must respond with a mixture of horror  and grief.  Our neighbor has been ravaged. We  have, as neighbors, an obligation, cou pled with a brother's concern, to do all  in our power to ease the suffering in  Mexico. We do not, as yet, know the  exact dimensions of the tragedy. It is  enough to know that the Earth shook,  the mountains rolled over, and mil lions of people had their lives ripped  apart like a tablecloth torn in two.  It is enough to know that we are  Americans,  and  that a  neighbor  is  bleeding. Not just a neighbor, but a  member of the family. Fortunately, we  are not powerless  to help. We can  follow  events  closely,  and  in  their  wake, we can open our hearts to the  Mexican people. We can give of our  material wealth. We can lend the re sources of our Government. We can  forget  that such a  thing as a geo graphical borderline exists, in a  time  of tragedy, because hearts are border less. Historically, and I am sure in this  instance,  the American  heart  has  proved and will prove bottomless.  Mr. President, at the time we consid er  the continuing  resolution,  I will  offer  this amendment and will wel come  cosponsors between  this  time  and that time.

1319,289,18,Mr. OLIN.," Mr. Speaker,  the 1985  farm bill will be on the floor today. I  would like to call all Members' atten tion to the dairy title.  We don't have a real big problem in  dairy, but for the past 5 years we've  been producing more milk than the  consumers and the Government need.  The problem has gradually been get ting worse and needs to be corrected.  Surplus production is now about 5  percent, only 5 extra pounds of milk  out of every 100 pounds milked.  We want to be sure not to overreact  to a 5-percent problem. The dairy title  in the farm bill seems to be much too  complicated, expensive, and risky.  I'll be offering an amendment that is  simple and effective. It will cost less. It  will fix the problem and keep it fixed.  It will help us get  the budget bal anced.  I urge all Members to get acquainted  with  the dairy proposals. Your vote  for a commonsense dairy policy is im portant.  HISPANIC HERITAGE ENRICHES  THE UNITED STATES  <Mr. DORNAN of California asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",1985
1320,289,18,Mr. DORNAN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, as you know, this week, Sep tember  16-20,  is Hispanic Heritage  Week.  I wish  to commend our col leagues ToM  and  from  the  other  body  colleague  Senator  LANTos  our  CLAIBORNE PELL for their initiative in  honoring throughout this week one of  the richest heritages to every contrib ute  to  the great American cultural  melting pot.  Mr. Speaker,  the  culture  of  the  Americas is a remarkable testimony to  the richness of human experience. My  great State of California owes much of  its historical traditon to the Hispanic  heritage which so infuses our State's  daily life with beauty and cultural vi tality. That rich historic inheritance is  also alive and well in the substantial  number of Americans who proudly  identify themselves as Hispanic-Ameri cans, now our largest ethnic subgroup.  The Hispanic tradition of family loyal ty, hard word, self-reliance, and most  importantly family  focus on  love of  God.  The  Hispanic  experience  is  rooted in deep religious conviction and  that is precisely in tune with the most  deep-rooted and venerated American  values.  It is excellent that this week be dedi cated to the recognition of the vibrant  and  treasured Hispanic  element of  American  life.  The United  States  would not be culturally enriched or as  productive as we are without the tre mendous vitality of the Hispanic con tribution. I salute Hispanic Heritage  Week and join my colleagues in honor ing our Hispanic brothers and sisters.  Via con Dios.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, a personal  note. Yesterday at the Little Company  of Mary Hospital in Torrance, CA, my  beloved oldest daughter Robin Marie  gave birth  to a beautiful healthy 7  pound, 14 ounce baby. My wife Sallie  and I now have four wonderful grand children to add to our own five. Con gratulation to the proud father Gary  Griffin. He  and my Sallie  are  at  Robin's side and I fly out to join them  tonight when, by my desire,  I  learn  the gender and name of my  little  grandbaby at the moment when I first  hold the precious bundle of love in my  arms. To be continued, Mr. Speaker.  ASSISTANCE TO THE  GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO  (Mr. TORRES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
1321,289,18,Mr. TORRES.," Mr. Speaker, we are  all shaken by the tragic events of late  in  the Republic of Mexico. My col leagues  have  taken  the  floor  this  morning to talk about this tragedy of  high magnitude.  Fortunately, reports that have come  in so far indicate that .American lives  have not been taken, with perhaps a  few injuries, and we are to be thankful  for that.  However, may I address the serious  problem  that  thousands  and  thou sands  of Mexican  citizens will  be  facing who have probably been killed  or injured in this tragedy of high mag nitude. Reports are that a third of the  city  has  been  devastated  and  the  subway is completed destroyed. And of  course the city's infrastructure is non functional.  Mr. Speaker, I call upon the House  of Representatives  today  to  enact  emergency authorizing  legislation  to  be able to assist the Government of  Mexico with emergency relief as indi cated by  the kinds of Government  agencies that we have. Mr. Speaker, I  call upon colleagues here in the House  assembled,  I  call  upon my  fellow  Americans to mobilize their resources,  voluntary and otherwise, to assist the  Mexican people in their hour of need.  0 1045  INCREASING FOREIGN USE OF  MIXED CREDIT FINANCING  <Mrs.  JOHNSON  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",1985
1322,289,18,Mrs. JOHNSON.," Mr. Speaker, part  of a comprehensive response to a large  U.S.  trade deficit must be to ensure  that American exporters can get com petitive  financing  for  overseas  projects. Our competitors are vigor ously supporting from 20 to as much  as 40 percent of their exports in the  scramble for major international con tracts while we support only about 3  percent of those deals.  The increasing foreign use of mixed  credits of official financing subsidies  has become a major problem for heavy  capital-intensive  industries  such  as  transportation,  aircraft,  powerplant  construction. The loss of foreign mar kets threatens jobs provided by thou sands  of  suppliers  throughout  our  Nation.  This problem has been identified by  every study of America's competitive ness  including  the President's Task  Force on International Enterprise. It  is a serious problem costing current  jobs but costing decades of loss, as we  cut ourselves out of the rich follow-on  market associated with  these export  sales.  The President's decision  to include  competitive  financing as part of his  approach to our current trade prob lems recognizes the importance of this  approach.  In the last session, I proposed a bill  on competitive financing and urge you  to join me in cosponsoring H.R. 3296,  also  supported and  cosponsored by  Representative BoNKER, the leader in  this mixed credit financing effort.

1324,302,18,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Michigan [Mr. SCHUETTE].  ",1985
1325,302,18,Mr.  SCHUETTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank my friend :::.nd my colleague, the  gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. QUIL LEN] for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this rule because it hurts farmers, and  I rise in objection to the actions of the  Committee on Rules in removing the  committee language which would have  given farmers in our exports a better  break today.  By the adoption of this rule, we are  hurting our blended credit sales and  impacting  our  intermediate  credit  sales as well at a time when America is  facing, and American farmers, ag pro ducers, are facing an export depres sion.  We do not play on a  level playing  field today for the American producer  because of high, unfair foreign subsi dies,  and high exchange  rates, and  cargo preference which, in some cases,  some instances, can increase the cost  of our exports 170 percent, and it does  not help us be price competitive  in  world markets. I have no bone to pick  and no quarrel with my colleagues,  that I respect, on the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries, nor a  quarrel with the maritime industry or  the maritime union, but do not take it  out on the farmers. Put it in another  budget; do not put it on the end cost.  Mr. Speaker, I will be voting against  this rule because of the basic unfair ness to American agriculture; because  it hits farmers smack dab in the jugu lar when there is enough hardship and  enough suffering out there as well.  So I would urge my colleagues  to  reject this rule, and by so doing, you  would be helping farmers and helping  American agriculture.  If we do not  prevail on this, and I hope we do, let  me say I will be very active with my  colleagues Mr. ROBERTS and Mr. ENG LISH  to try to get some fairness and  some help to exports and to the Amer ican agriculture producer.  ",1985
1326,302,18,Mr.  BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen tleman  from Oklahoma  [Mr.  ENG LISH].  ",1985
1327,302,18,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  oppose  the  rule and object  to  the  action of the House Rules Committee  yesterday  in  reporting out  to  the  House floor H.R. 2100 without section  1141 of title 11 as agreed to by the  House Committee on Agriculture and  as the committee reported out the bill.  Mr. Speaker, section 1141 as reported  by the House Committee on Agricul ture contained  language which was  vital to the agriculture industry. The  substance of the provision was clearly  within the jurisdiction of the Agricul ture Committee and clearly germane  to omnibus  farm bill package, H.R.  2100. The provision, which is aimed at  curtailing a  court-ordered expansion  of cargo preference regulations with  regard  to  agriculture  exports, was  originally referred to the House Com mittee on Agriculture. I am afraid that  the House Rules Committee  ignored  this point in allowing the motion to  strike the provision to prevail. I feel  that it would have been far better to  leave the debate on the merits of the  cargo preference  in agriculture  issue  solely for the House floor and not for  the House Rules Committee. Instead,  a vital aspect of the House farm bill  and a vital issue for American agricul ture has been stricken from H.R. 2100.  I object  to  this aspect of  the rule  under which the House Rules Commit tee recommends that we consider and  debate H.R. 2100.  ",1985
1328,302,18,Mr.  BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  I would  like  to make a couple of  comments with  respect  to what my  colleagues have said on the issue of  cargo  preference  and  second  the  number of people who  have  risen  against the rule.  With respect to the cargo preference  issue, No. 1, Members should be aware  that under Public Law 664 which is  the Cargo Preference Act which was  adopted I believe in the early 1950's,  1954; only 2 percent of the total U.S.  agricultural trade was conducted with  respect to cargo preference, 2 percent  in 1983.  So we are not talking about the total  export agricultural program  in  this  country; we are talking about a very  small portion. That figure, according  to who you read and what recent deci sions were handed down by the court,  can fluctuate from 2 to 10 percent; but  generally 2 percent is the figure that  has been accepted.  The second point I would  like  to  make is that the jurisdiction over that  act belongs within the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries. I rec ognize, and the Committee on Rules  recognizes that the Commodity Credit  Corporation Act,  has  jurisdictional  home within the Committee on Agri culture. Therefore, you have a situa tion where both committees what to  retain jurisdiction over this particular  issue.  Through careful deliberations,  the  Committee on Rules felt that under  this bill that we have blended togeth er, predominantly dominated, obvious ly, by agriculture issues, that it was  appropriate to take the position as ad vocated by  the Committee on Mer chant Marine and Fisheries and  its  chairman, the gentleman from Nort.h  Carolina [Mr. JoNES].  Now, my good friend, the gentleman  from Oklahoma [Mr. ENGLISH] stated  that we ought to leave this debate for  the floor. Well, it is going to happen  on the floor; Mr. ENGLISH, as he point ed out, will offer an amendment, and  the Members on this floor will make  that final decision on whether or not  they want to adopt his position and  those that have been expressed by Mr.  ROBERTS and others, or whether they  want  to retain the law as  it stands  today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1985
1329,302,18,Mr. QUILLEN.," Mr. Speaker, since  there has been a lot of discussion on  the rule in regard to cargo preference,  I would like to state that that subject  is under the jurisdiction of the Com mittee on Merchant Marine and Fish eries, and I do not think the Commit tee on Agriculture should try to take  jurisdiction of that.  Therefore,  I  support strongly  the  present language made in order in the  rule and will help to try to sustain it  when and if amendment is offered.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman  from Nebraska  [Mrs.  SMITH].  If  ",1985
1330,302,18,Mrs.  SMITH  of  Nebraska.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in opposition to House  Resolution Revise 267, to provide for  consideration H.R. 2100, the Food Se curity Act of 1985. While I support  consideration of the farm bill at this  time and commend the House Agricul ture Committee for reporting the bill,  I am opposed to certain aspects of the  proposed rule.  Specifically,  I  am vehemently op posed to the provision that allows the  language regarding cargo preference,  as reported by the Agriculture Com mittee, to be deleted in a last-minute  move by  the Merchant Marine and  Fisheries  Committee.  this  rule  passes, there will be an amendment of fered  to  reinstate  the Agriculture  Committee's language that will allow  our agricultural exports to get moving  again.  Mr. Speaker, when our American  farmers are clearly in crisis and our  commercial  export  promotion  pro grams have been threatened and ren dered ineffective by the expansion of  cargo preference  to  them,  I  find a  ruling that favors a discredited mari time program to be highly unfair.  Mr. Speaker, during  its  consider ation of this measure, the Committee  on Agriculture reaffirmed its commit ment to a strong merchant marine and  at the same time, took steps to ensure  the  practicality  of  the  farm  bill's  export  enhancement  programs. By  striking section 1141 of the bill,  the  Rules Committee has produced  an  unfair farm bill contrary to the wishes  of the authorizing committee. I, there fore, am strongly opposed to the rule.

1332,315,18,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman  from  Tennessee  [Mr.  JoNEs], chairman of our Subcommit tee on Conservation, Credit, and Rural  Development.  ",1985
1333,315,18,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Chair man, I rise in support of the farm bill.  This bill is a  long way from what I  think American farmers need. It has  many shortcomings but it has some  strong points as well.  The commodity price support pro grams I feel are generally inadequate  in that they do not provide sufficient  mandatory  production  controls  or  price guarantees. However, the farmer  referendum  tied  to  the Voluntary  Marketing Certificate  Program  on  wheat and feed grains is a move in the  right direction. This program should  be expanded to other commodities.  I also support the compromise dairy  program and encourage my colleagues  to support it. The dairy proposal does  not please dairymen in all regions but  it is a true compromise, and I believe it  serves the interests of the industry as  a whole and will help ensure  that  American consumers will have a de pendable  supply of milk and dairy  products.  Further, I am extremely proud of  the resource conservation  title. This  package, which  includes a  conserva tion reserve, sodbuster and swampbus ter programs,  is probably  the most  comprehensive soil conservation pack age ever to come before the House.  I plan to support the bill. American  farmers are  in deep  trouble and we  must  keep  the  legislative  process  moving, attempting to improve the bill  where we can.

1335,315,18,Mr. SCHUETTE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank my  friend and my colleague  from  Kansas  ROBERTS],  and  before I give my general comments on  the most important piece of agricul tural legislation since the 1930's; yes,  this 1985 farm bill, I want to offer my  congratulations  to Chairman DE  GARZA and our ranking member, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  IGAN], for the able leadership and the  demonstrated competence that both of  these individuals handled this tough,  tough situation that we have in agri culture today.  Now there are problems, and there is  a depression, and a crisis, and severe  stress  facing  agriculture  producers,  American  farmers,  all  across  rural  America and  in the  lOth district  in  mid-Michigan. I  think my producers,  my farmers are no different than the  symptoms and  the problems  facing  farmers across this land.  These are human problems involving  families, and men, and women, young,  and old; and we have a rich tradition  in this country, of agriculture. It is a  fabric and a vibrancy that has helped  this great land. I recognize this as an  advocate for agriculture, in seeing the  problems we have in Michigan.  These problems, yes, are severe, and  they are many. From low, low prices see  it at B&W Co-op  in Brecken!  ",1985
1336,328,18,Mr. ROBERTS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 4 minutes  to my distinguished  colleague, the gentleman from Missou ri [Mr. CoLEMAN], who is the ranking  member on the Conservation, Credit,  and Rural Development Subcommit tee.  ",1985
1337,328,18,Mr. COLEMAN  of Missouri.," Mr.  Chairman, let me add my voice of com mendation to our chairman, the gen tleman from Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA],  who is certainly recognized as a fair in dividual and as a chairman who gives  everybody the opportunity to be heard  and to express himself by amendment  or by opinion  in our committee.  I  thank him for his courtesies as we  have drafted this bill through the last  9 months.  Mr. Chairman, Agriculture and rural  America are going through the most  difficult adjustment period since the  1930's. High interest rates, low prices,  declining land values and bad weather  have made  it nearly  impossible  for  farmers  to maintain a positive cash flow in many areas of the country.  The migration of people away from  U.S.  farms has been dramatic. The  percentage of the U.S. population engaged in farming has decreased from  about 25 percent in 1935 to less than  2.5 percent  in 1985. The number of  farms has fallen by more than 60 per cent during that period.  We have before us for consideration  a farm bill to reauthorize farm pro grams for the next 5 years. The bill  has several new programs that should  help the agricultural economy. Howev er, we must also recognize that this  bill will not create a miracle and will  not change the agricultural economy  over night, but this bill will help agri culture get back on the right track.  There are many who believe that the  programs in the 1981 farm bill have  not worked. The 1981  farm bill was  written in a time of high inflation. We  anticipated that inflation would con tinue and we build  inflation factors  into the farm programs. In doing so,  we made our agriculture products non competitive on world markets. The in creased value of the dollar in compari son to other currencies has only com pounded the problem of competitive ness.  It  is  clear  that  rural America  is  going through a very difficult transi tional period. Steps must be taken now  to prevent the raveling of the fabric of  rural America. I am hopeful that this  bill will help strengthen the threads  that bind rural America together.  One of the brightest shining stars in  this  bill  is  the  conservation  title.  Working in a bipartisan manner Mr.  JONES, chairman on the Conservation,  Credit and Rural Development Sub committee, and  I  have  fashioned  a  conservation  title  that has  received  overwhelming support.  Last year  this body passed a Soil  Conservation Act that had many of  the same provisions  included  in the  conservation  title of H.R. 2100. We  were disappointed when the legislation  died in conference. However, this year  we have worked in a bipartisan spirit  to develop an even stronger conserva tion program. The administration has  endorsed the conservation title as well  as  many  soil  and  environmental  groups.  Soil is, very simply, one of our most  valuable resources and we can't con tinue to let it erode at a faster rate  than  it  is  replaced. We must  take  action now to save our land. The sod buster and conservation reserve provi sions in the conservation title will help  to preserve our land for future genera tions.  Mr. Chairman, I have reserved time  later on today for a special order to  continue my discussion of this bill and  would invite others to remain also.  ",1985

1339,328,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  I would say that today there  is a  growing awareness in America of the  importance of agriculture to our econ omy. Unfortunately,  there  are  no  short-term solutions to the problems  of agriculture. The challenge  to the  House Agriculture  Committee was  threefold: to v.Tite a farm bill, to deal  with  the  short-term  problems  of  having borrowed  $100  billion more  money than we farmers can pay back  with current income; second, to meet a  budget  requirement  imposed by  the  House and Senate conference on the  budget; and  third,  to provide  some  long-term hope of working ourselves  out of this dilemma we find ourselves  in.  We have met that budget challenge.  As tough as it has been, we have met  it. We could have used another $11 bil lion, as the Senate Agriculture Com mittee reported last night, but we do  not have it.  Unfortunately, we still have $150 bil lion deficits as far as the eye can see  and I submit we will never solve our  farm problem or our Nation's problem  until we solve our propensity to spend  more than we have as a nation.  Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 2100. I  encourage each and every one of you  also. Where our committee has been  split, we will allow the will of the ma jority  to work. Where you have an  idea to improve it, you will have an op portunity under an open rule to im prove this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2100 gives us  the tools necessary to begin working  our way out of the dilemma we find  ourselves in. It is a more logical basing  yields bill,  a more effective supply management program, clear title legis lation granting to innocent third-party  buyers the necessary protection they  need in this world today; a conserva tion  title you have heard so much  about, and I join with those who have  expressed their support for that.  I hope that each and every one of  you will join in opposing every farm  income weakening  amendment  that  comes on this floor. The dairy substi tute, the sugar substitute, the peanut  substitute, all will reduce farm income.  We do not have farm income to share.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the bill.  ",1985

1341,328,18,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Chairman, so  much has already been said about the  bill and about the situation today in  agriculture, but it does bear repeating.  We are meeting at a time when we are  in absolutely the worst condition agri culture has witnesses  in  the last 50  ",1985
1342,341,18,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  let me begin by commending Mr. DE LA  GARZA,  the chairman of the Agriculture  Committee, and Mr. MADIGAN, the ranking  Republican who have worked many  long  and oftentimes difficult hours to bring H.R.  2100  to the House floor. That has been a  thankless task and their efforts should be  duly noted as nothing short of heroic.  Mr. Chairman, I'm sure we can all agree  on the fact that this is not a perfect farm  bill. Members of the Agriculture Commit tee, other Members of this body, the admin istration, farmers, industry officials, econo mists-all have different views on how we  can improve the American farmer's plight.  As a matter of fact, I will work to have  some  of  the  provisions  in H.R.  2100  changed during the floor debate.  Now,  I don't doubt  that all our views  have merit. In fact, I would be the first to  say, ""Let's incorporate everyone's ideas,"" if  I thought that would work. The plain and  simple truth of the matter is, through little  fault of its own, the American farm com munity is in serious trouble. These troubles  can be attributed to many things; ineffec tive Government programs, high  interest  rates, a runaway Federal deficit, a danger ously high trade deficit-and the list goes  on and on.  No single piece of legislation can solve  all these evils. However, H.R. 2100 is a vehi cle, a good vehicle by which we can develop  an American farm program.  The farmers of this Nation are waiting  for us,  their elected officials  to provide  them with a window clear enough to give  our farmers a vision of what  the future  holds for them.  We have a challenge ahead of us. I hope  the Members of this body will meet it head  on.  We owe that to those who make up the  roots and  the  fiber of our Nation,  the  American farmer.  ",1985

1348,341,18,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Mr. Speak er, as you know, the House Ways and  Means Committee is poised to begin  consideration of  comprehensive  tax  reform legislation and markup should  commence  before  the  end  of  the  month. It is likely that there will be  some substantial changes to the Presi dent's tax reform proposal, which I en dorsed with reservations when I testi fied before the committee on June 18,  1985.  The ext~nsive hearings held by the  Ways and Means Committee over the  summer have served a useful role in  identifying specific areas of concern. It  has  become  apparent  that  some  changes will have to be made and the  Reagan administration has  indicated  that it is agreeable to some changes. It  also appears that most of the changes  will result in the loss of revenue. This  is particularly true in important areas  such as State and local tax deductions,  recapture,  and  the  investment  tax  credit. Compromises  in  these areas  could lead to revenue losses of tens of  billions of dollars.  Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI has stead fastly maintained that any tax reform  bill must be  revenue neutral. The  budget deficit  is already monstrous,  and  tax  reform must not aggravate  the budget problems. If the Ways and  Means Committee makes changes to  the President's proposal that lead to  massive revenue losses, they will have  to find additional revenues to offset  the losses.  Recent  reports  suggest  that some  members of the committee are consid ering imposing additional taxes on the  U.S. petroleum  industry  in order  to  offset  anticipated  revenue  losses.  I  find  these  reports  disturbing. The  Ways and Means Committee has never  been  particularly  sensitive  to  the  needs of the U.S. petroleum industry,  at least since the early seventies.

1350,367,18,Mr. HALL of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the De troit Free Press and the Detroit News have  both given their editorial support to the Su perfund  legislation reported by  the Com mittee on Energy and Commerce in July,  and  I want  to  take  this opportunity  to  share  them with my  colleagues  in  the  House.  In our efforts to reach agreement on Su perfund  legislation,  committee members  spent numerous days on one of the most  tortuous  issues  facing us. Certainly  it  is  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  one of the single most serious-and most  difficult to resolve-of all the environmen tal problems facing this country today. The  consensus arrived at, which garnered three quarters of the committee's members in the  vote on final passage, would provide $10  billion over the next 5 years.  Personally,  I  think  that $10 billion  is  more money than can be prudently spent  by EPA, and more than we can afford now  in these times of huge budget deficits and  tight budgets. But in the spirit of compro mise, as well as in recognition of our need  to proceed to clean up our hazardous waste  dumps, I voted in favor of the legislation  with  the majority of my colleagues. The  Detroit News  editorial  rather eloquently  states my views on this score, disagreeing  with my full committee chairman, Mr. DIN GELL, on funding, while approving some of  his other views. It said, ""The good side is  that Mr. Dingell eliminated some of the bad  requirements and  tried  to put together a  tax that wouldn't affect companies' inter national competitiveness. The bad part is  that he didn't cut the $10-billion program  to reasonable ltvels.""  The Detroit Free Press, on  the other  hand, does support the $10 billion. Never theless,  the  Free Press  does  have  the  wisdom and the grace to praise the con gressional oversight process by stating the  following:  But the best guarantee that any Super fund will work lies in the quality of over sight exercised by Congress. EPA has spent  $1 billion of Superfund money so far and  succeeded in cleaning up only six sites-and  that only since the former Superfund ad ministrator was jailed and the former head  of the EPA cashiered by an angry Congress.  Close oversight  from Congress-combined  with an increase in knowledge about toxic  wastes-remains the best assurance that the  EPA will spend its next $10 billion much  more efficiently and wisely.  I am pleased that the Free Press has ac knowledged  the contributions  to effective  governance that can be made through con gressional oversight. The Superfund is an  enormously  complex  and  expensive pro gram  that undoubtedly will  require sub stantial oversight, and I  take comfort  in  knowing  that Chairman DINGELL'S Over sight and Investigations Subcommittee and  its capable staff are committed to exercis ing this function fairly and responsibly.  I would  like at this point to share the  complete  texts of the  two editorials with  the Members.  [See  attached,  ""Superfund:  It'll  take  money, research and oversight to mop up  the mess"" and ""Superfund: It's Becoming A  Hydra.""]  [From the Detroit News July 15, 19851  SUPERFUND: IT'S BECOMING A HYDRA  Temperatures  in Washington have been  hovering  around  the  100-degree mark,  which may explain the way in which Con gress had handled legislation to renew Su perfund, the program to clean up orphaned  hazardous waste dumps. Perhaps the honor ables are suffering heat stroke.  The House and Senate both have insisted  on  giving  the Environmental Protection  Agency  <EPA>  far more money  than  it  needs. EPA Administrator Lee Thomas and  24591  his predecessor, William D. Ruckelshaus,  both told congressional committees that the  agency  simply hasn't the personnel,  the  need, or the expertise to spend more than  $5 billion over the next five years. In the  first  five-year program, now ending,  the  agency strained its resources to spend $1.6  billion. A $5 billion program would  force  EPA to increase its work by 17 percent in  each of the five years.  That has no daunted senators and repre sentatives who seem to view spending as a  moral  imperative. The Senate's Environ ment and Public Works, Finance. and Judi ciary committees have approved a $7.5-bil lion bill, which is now ready for a floor vote.  The House has bid up the price even fur ther. Rep John Dingell's Commerce and  Energy Committee is considering a $10-bil lion measure. After its markup, the bill will  visit  the Ways and Means and Judiciary  committees before going to the House floor.  To put that in perspective, the EPA would  have to increase its work by 30 to 40 percent  each year for five years to spend $10 billion.  Much of this spending is the handiwork of  lobbyists  for  enviromental  organizations.  They now are demanding enormous sums  and impossible work schedules in order to  complete what they consider a vital task of  cleaning. Politicians aren't resisting much  because voters won't bear the cleanup costs  directly. The  1,000  industrial  comapnies  that produce  and  utilize  chemicals will  simply receive a huge new tax bill. The costs  of that tax then will seep slowly down to  consumers.  During  the last five-year period. Super fund got 87.5 percent of its $1.6 billion from  a tax on feedstocks paid by a couple of hun dred chemical companies, at  the  rate of  more  than $300 million a year. The rest  came from federal tax revenues.  The Senate renewal bill leaves the feed stock tax in place and imposes a transaction  tax on 1,000 industries <including auto com panies)  that utilize  hazardous materials.  Congressional accountants figure  this will  raise an additional $6 billion over five years.  The Chemical Manufacturers Association  says this would be applied to the wholesale  value of products, and  looks suspiciously  like America's  first  value-added  tax,  al though the precise details are not worked  out.  The House proposes a more comprehen sive revenue base-$4.5 billion from a broad ly based industrial transaction tax, $1.5 bil lion from chemical feedstocks, $1.25 billion  from general federal tax revenues, $1.5 bil lion  from a new waste disposal  tax, and  $1.25 billion from a new  tax on gasoline,  supposedly to take care of cleaning up leaks  from underground fuel storage tanks.  Rep. Dingell is credited with bringing the  House proceedings into focus when he re portedly engineered an end run around the  excesses of Rep. James J. Florio, D-New  Jersey, chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and Tourism. Rep. Florio  wanted rigid schedules on how many sites  the EPA had to clean up per year, an impos sible demand because all sites are complex  and must be subjected to a careful engineer ing and scientific study before the hazards  can safely be removed. Mr. Dingell co-spon sored the ""consensus"" bill with Rep. Dennis  Eckart, D-Ohio,  that orders  the EPA  to  begin  investigation of and engineering on  150 sites in the first year, 175  the second  year and 200 a year after that, without im posing deadlines for completion of remedial  work. Rep. Florio's subcommittee passed  the ""consensus"" bill 13 to 6.  ",1985

1355,393,18,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. President,  this  morning, after  the convening  there  will be time for the two leaders under  the standing order of 10 minutes each.  We have a special order not to exceed  15 minutes for Senator PRoXMIRE. We  will then have routine morning busi ness not to extend beyond the hour of  1 p.m. with Senators permitted  to  speak therein for not more than 10  minutes each.  Following routine morning business,  the Senate will then resume consider ation of S. 51,  the Superfund bill.  Under the previous orders and under standings,  there will be no  rollcall  votes  during Monday's session, but  indeed we will be processing the Su perfund  legislation and amendments  this afternoon of Senator RoTH and  others.  THANKS TO SENATOR MITCHELL  Let me at  this moment pay my  regard and respect to Senator MITCH ELL, who, as comanager of the bill with  Senator STAFFORD, both of them doing  an able job, was willing to withhold an  amendment of his out of personal deference to me in meeting a situation  Friday afternoon that I could not de cline.  I  deeply  appreciate Senator  MITCHELL and his accommodation of  me.  It was  a  little bit  above  and  beyond the call, and I thank him.  THE IIOIIGRATION BILL  Then, I might just relate within the  time of the leader that I personally  am most appreciative of the courtesies  of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle with regard to processing of S.  1200, the immigration measure. In a  long period of 7 days, or portions  thereof,  the Senate, I might inform  the body, consumed 36 hours and 12  minutes on that measure, with 16 roll call votes, 39 amendments and motions  considered, and 24 of  those amend ments were agreed  to, 1  rejected, 6  tabled, 4 withdrawn, and 4 not acted  upon.  I wish to thank my colleagues for  turning their attention to that matter  in the midst of a very full national  agenda and I appreciate that. I think  that is one of the things that needed  to be addressed. We did address it. I  thank you. I believe Members would  be interested in the time expended on  that measure.

1359,393,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on  June 29 of this year, Assistant Secre tary of Defense Richard Perle spoke  at a conference on nuclear prolifera tion at Geneva. Mr. Perle argued that  the  public  generally  believes  the  United States and the Soviet Union  are engaged in a nuclear arms race.  ""And,"" said Secretary Perle, ""the facts  are significantly different."" To hear  Perle  tell  it,  the United States has  been busily engaged in unilateral nu clear disarmament  for  the past 20  years while the Soviet Union has been  roaring ahead with a massive nuclear  buildup.  Can this be true? The answer is a  sure  and  obvious  ""No.""  Secretary  Perle summons some fancy figures to  make his  case. First, he  says  the  United States has 8,000 fewer nuclear  weapons deployed around the world in  1985 than we had in 1967. Second, we  have agreed with our NATO allies to  reduce  our European-based nuclear  weapons by an additional 1,400. Now  doesn't that sound impressive?  But what does  ""nuclear weapon""  mean?  And what  does  ""deployed  around the world"" mean? Obviously, if  we withdraw 8,000 or 10,000  small,  ""land-mine""  type  tactical  nuclear  weapons from Europe by  itself that  fact means very little. We may at the  same time deploy an equal or greater  nuclear capability by  submarine or  bomber. We may regard the European  deployment as ""deployed around the  world."" We may consider the U.S. sub marines and bombers as not so de ployed. Perle can take this position. If  as much of our nuclear deterrent is de ployed at sea or in the air and most of  the rest of it is based in the United  States-this deployment may not be  considered as ""around the world."" And  yet it is specifically deployed to give  our country the capacity to deliver a  devastating nuclear payload on  the  Soviet Union under any conceivable  circumstances.  Perle further says ""the megatonnage  of this diminished American force  is  barely one-quarter of what it was in  the late 1960's."" Apparently Perle is  referring  to  the American  nuclear  force in Europe. What does this mean?  Does it mean this country has unila terly without any quid pro quo from  the U.S.S.R. cut the megatonnage of  its nuclear forces  in Europe without  any counterbalancing of this lost nu clear capability elsewhere?  there  any  informed person  in  the entire  world who will believe that? Has this  Congress been appropriating tens of  billions of dollars for nuclear arms de terrence every year for  the past 20  years while the Defense Department  has found some mysterious way to cut  our nuclear deterrence on our front line-facing our great  adversary  in  Europe by three quarters. If this is the  case, some heads should roll including  that of Richard Perle, known far and  Is  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

1360,432,18,Mr. HATCH.," The remaining sections  of the technical bill includes the fol lowing:  Section 8 relates to grants for a council on  health care technology. This is to address  concerns raised by the Justice Department  concerning  the Council on Health Care  Technology Assessment located in the Nationa! Academy of Sciences, authorized as  part of S. 771  in the 98th Congress. This  clarifies the role of this new private sector  council  in assessing new medical  technol ogies and its relationship with the federal  activities conducted by the National Center  for Health Services Research and Medical  Technology Assessment.  Section 9 authorizes limited exception to  the present ceiling on the number of the  general officer grades in the Public Health  Service  to allow  for  the detail  from  the  Service of up to three general grade officers  to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs in policy making  positions.  Presently, the Public Health Service Act  limits the number of general officer grades  for commission officers of the Public Health  Service to one percent of the total number  of commissioned officers. Because of  this  limitation, the Department of Health and  Human Services has been understandably  reluctant to detail general grade officers of  the Service  to critical policy-making posi tions  in the health field  in other depart ments,  including  the Department of De fense.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs, Dr. William Mayer, holds  the grade of Major General in the Public  Health Service while serving in this position  pursuant  to  Presidential  appointment.  Deputy Assistant Secretaries of Defense for  Health Affairs serve in positions authorized  for Senior Executive Service grades of civil ian personnel or general office grades for  military personnel. One of these top-level  positions  is presently  filled by a Public  Health Service Commissioned officer at a  grade corresponding with the military rank  of colonel and the civilian grade of GS-15.  Fully consistent with provisions of  the  Public Health Services Act authorizing the  detail of Service officers to other executive  departments, Public Health Service officers  detailed to the Office of the Assistant Secre tary of Defense  for Health Affairs have  been the primary officials responsible for  the development  and  implementation of  quality assurance  initiatives responsive  to  Congressional support for bolstering public  confidence  in  the military  health  care  system.  Making provision for the detail of up to  three Public Health Service officers of ap propriate grade to top policy-making posi tions in the Office of the Assistant Secre tary of Defense Health Affairs will advance  the initiatives of the Secretary of Defense  in this important area.  Section 10 of the bill allows for the con tinued care of severely mentally disabled  merchant seamen who were  inadvertently  excluded from provisions of the 1981 Recon ciliation bill which provided for transitional  care for hospitalized merchant seamen, at  the  time  that  the Public Health Service  Hospitals were closed. At that time, approxi mately  45  severely  mentally  disabled  seamen were receiving care in private care  facilities  in Kentucky, pursuant to a con tract between the State of Kentucky and  the National Institute of Mental Health.  These merchant seamen had been in the  National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical  Research Center  in Lexington, and were  moved to private facilities when that Center  closed in the early 1970's. There are cur rently 26 such seamen receiving care. This  amendment would allow  the Secretary of  Health and Human Services  to reimburse  the State of Kentucky for the care of these  seamen since the contract expired last November, and would allow the Secretary to  make arrangements for the continuing care  of these severely disabled individuals.  Section 11 of the bill provides for techni cal and conforming amendments while sec tion 12 of the bill provides for the repeal of  obsolete provisions.  Mr. President, all of the provisions  in this amendment are noncontrover sial and necessary for efficient and ef fective operation of the Public Health  Service. I urge my colleagues  to ap prove expeditiously this bill and refer  it to the House for their consideration.

1373,497,18,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr.  Presi dent, I rise today to speak against the  Roth amendment. I am in favor of in cluding an authorization for a demon stration program to assist people who  have been exposed to hazardous sub stances at Superfund sites with their  medical expenses in this bill.  Mr. President,  I am a member of  both the Finance Committee and the  Committee  on  Environment  and  Public Works where  this  legislation  has been proposed  and  considered.  And so I have studied it carefully. I  am also chairman of the Health Sub committee of the Finance Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Medi care and Medicaid Programs. Those  programs  are  health  entitlements.  This program is not. This is a demon stration program authorized for a lim ited period of time and for a limited  purpose.  I must confess that when Senator  MITCHELL  first  offered  this  amend ment 2 years ago, I spoke out against  it. I was concerned that it would create  very different levels of expected com pensation across the Nation, much as  has happened with the Social Security  Disability Program. My views on that  difficulty have not changed. But the  amendment has been modified, so that  concern is no longer relevant. The pro gram  is now focused on sites rather  than States, so my concern has been  addressed.  In a similar way many other prob lems have been dealt with  through  amendments to the original language.  I encourage Members  to pay special  heed so that they will understand the  actual provisions that are in the bill as  reported, and not cast their vote ac cording to what they may have heard  about victims' assistance  in the  last  Congress or years ago, nor what they  may have heard about agent orange,  dioxin, or any of the other things that  have been spoken about. I say again, I  was a skeptic. I did not want a new  Health Care Entitlement Program. I  understand health care entitlements.  And this is not one. It is a demonstra tion program for assistance to people  at Superfund sites. And I support it.  Mr.  President,  the Senator  from  Maine has often made the point that  if you own a tree or a stream or some  other natural resource, you can file a  claim against the fund for compensa tion if that resource was damaged by  the release of a hazardous substance.  But if it is your health-or the health  of your children-or your ability  to  earn a living that was damaged, then  Superfund is not for you. People that  are  injured by hazardous substances  are thrown back to reliance on a crazy  quilt of State laws that put hurdles in  the way of compensation  for  toxic  torts at every  turn. That  is upside  down, Mr. President, and I commend  the Senator from Maine for recogniz ing the tragic irony of current law and  for persevering so effectively by insist ing that we, at least, examine the pos sibility of providing justice to people  who are victims  in a more effective  and efficient way.  I urge that the amendment to strike  be defeated.  ",1985
1374,497,18,Mr. MITCHELL., I yield 1 minute to  the Senator from New Jersey.  ,1985
1375,497,18,Mr. BRADLEY.," I thank the Senator  for yielding.  Mr. President,  I  rise  to urge  the  Senate to oppose the amendment of fered  by  the distinguished Senator  from Delaware, Senator RoTH. Clear ly, the prime objective of any Super fund legislation is to obtain the money  and the authority to clean up  toxic  waste dumps across this country. The  bill that we are now considering has  an enhanced capacity to do that and  much more funds to do that.  But in addition to that, Mr. Presi dent, I think it is quite justifiable that  we have in this bill a small pilot pro gram on victims' coq1pensation. This is  not a major new entitlement. This is  not anything close to national health  insurance. This happens to be a very  ",1985
1376,523,18,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President,  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Re sponse Compensation  and Liability  Act or Superfund was enacted in 1980  in response to the need for the Gov ernment to act quickly to clean up pol lution caused by toxic substances.  It was enacted in the wake of Love  Canal, with the recognition that we  had ignored toxic waste disposal for  too  long,  and with  the hope  that  future Love Canals could be avoided.  For  too  long,  ill-conceived  toxic  waste disposal practices were allowed  to  continue  threatening  the public  health and polluting the environment.  The 1980 law was the first systemat ic attempt to prevent further public  health issues.  As EPA began to seriously address  the problems of past hazardous waste  disposal practices, the size and scope  of the program grew.  Hazardous wastes were found in un expected places. Montana, for exam ple, with  its vast open spaces and  small population size has eight sites  listed on the national priority list for  cleanup.  The entire Clark Fork River from its  headwaters at Silver Bow Creek all  the way to the Milltown Dam outside  of Missoula, a distance of over 80 miles  had been damaged by past mining ac tivities.  While  the popular notion  is  that  toxic waste is found only in industrial  States, we in Montana found out dif ferently. We discovered  that mining  our gold, silver, copper and other min erals left a legacy just as deadly as the  most  heavily  polluting  industrial  plant.  In  the next national priority  list  update, still more sites will be identi fied. Nationwide, the list could grow to  over 12,000 sites.  Failure  to  respond  to  these  toxic  waste threats will endanger the future  of our children.  SUI04ARY OF S. 51  The legislation addresses both the  scope of Superfund and its funding.  S. 51 makes a number of positive im provements in the Superfund.  The bill responsibly raises the reve nue necessary  to fund cleanup. The  feedstock tax on petroleum and chemi cal feedstocks is continued at its cur rent level of $1.5 billion. This tax on  42 feedstock chemicals will continue to  penalize those most who manufacture  most of the building blocks of chemi cal wastes.  ",1985
1377,549,18,Mr.  CRANSTON.," Mr.  President,  along with my colleague from Massa chusetts, Senator KENNEDY,  I  today  submit a concurrent resolution con cerning the recent arrest of Ms. Lee  Ya-p'ing.  Ms. Lee, a Taiwan citizen with per manent  immigrant  status  in  the  United States,  is  publisher of  the  International Daily News, a Los Ange les-based Chinese language newspaper.  She was arrested by the Taiwan Garri son  Command  September  17  and  charged with sedition for articles she  published in the United States. This  charge can carry the death penalty. In  more recent information received from  the State Department  today,  it ap pears  the Taiwan  authorities  have  backpedaled and are now accusing Ms.  Lee  of  distribution  of  subversive  papers; this charge carries a 7to 15year sentence.  Investigative proceed ings may take up to 3 months, during  which  time Ms. Lee would have no  access to family or an attorney.  Mr. President,  the charges of  the  Taiwan  authorities  are  unfounded.  The arrest of Ms. Lee for the exercise  of  freedoms protected by  the U.S.  Constitution while residing in Califor nia can only be seen as an act of in timidation and harassment. It is outra geous and unjustifiable.  The concurrent resolution calls upon  the Taiwan authorities to release Ms.  Lee Ya-p'ing immediately and uncon ditionally and  to  renounce  formally  and officially any claims to  jurisdic tion over lawfully performed acts in  the United States. We also call upon  President Reagan to use all peaceable  means to obtain her release.  I invite my colleagues to join me in  cosponsoring  this concurrent  resolu tion, and I urge the Senate to act deci sively and quickly  to send a strong,  clear message to the Taiwan authori ties that the United States will not tol erate such injustices.  SENATE  RESOLUTION  227URGING  A  JOINT  UNITED  STATES-SOVIET  EFFORT  TO  ACHIEVE  WORLDWIDE  DIS EASE IMMUNIZATION BY 1990  Mr.  PELL <for  himself  and Mr.  LUGAR) submitted the following resolu tion; which was referred to the Com mittee on Foreign Relations:  S. RES. 227  Whereas six dise~es-measles, diphtheria,  tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and  polio-each year ravage the children of the  world, killing some 5,000,000 and leaving an  equal number disabled;  Whereas  the medical  technology  now  exists  to  immunize  the world's children  against these diseases at an estimated cost  of $5 per child-a total cost of $500 million  for the 100 million children born in the de veloping countries each year;  Whereas medical  studies  estimate  that  such immunization could reduce child mor tality around the world by as much as one half;  Whereas reduced child mortality is crucial  to attaining levels of econOinic development  associated with reduced population growth;  Whereas  in  the 1960's and 1970's  the  United States and the Soviet Union cooper ated effectively together and with Qther na tions in a United Nations program which, by  1980,  ended  the  scourge  of  smallpox  throughout the world;  Whereas responsible scientists now believe  that  a  concerted  international  program  could achieve immunization of all children  on earth against all major diseases by 1990;  and  Whereas  recent  international efforts  to  assist the famine-stricken people of Africa  demonstrate a powerful impulse among the  people of the developed nations to direct re sources toward people less fortunate;  Now, Therefore, be it  Resolved,  <1> That the United States and the Soviet  Union  should  immediately  undertake  a  formal commitment to initiate, using their  own resources and those of other donors  and  appropriate multilateral  agencies,  a  joint effort to bring the benefits of immuni zation to all children of the world by the  year 1990;  (2) That this  joint world  immunization  effort should be undertaken in a spirit of  common dedication to a  transcending hu manitarian purpose, and with the practical  hope  that such constructive collaboration  may also serve as a model for further super power cooperation.

1384,562,18,Mr. SCHNUELLE.," I think in the Bible teach ing it does go into that. You're either Christ  or anti-Christ, you're either a  follower or  against him.  RIVERA. The current  tragedy down on  America's family farm is being compounded,  it's being made that much worse by a grow ing, frightening harvest of hate. When the  sheriff comes to take away the Schnuelle  family farm. as he surely will, perhaps Dave  will be able  to draw some small comfort  from his strong, sincere but ultimately sick  belief that it was all somebody else's fault.  After a lot of pain and suffering, the finan cial crisis out here should pass. But the soul  of America's heartland may prove harder to  heal.

Geraldo, this is shock ing and frightening and terribly depressing,  to say the least. How widespread is this?  RIVERA. These are underground organiza tions, obviously, so it's very, very difficult to  tell. The old-line organizations that keep  watch on these radical groups like the Klan watch, etc.,  say  there are seven  to nine  thousand Klan members, but with the Iden tity movement,  they're not as sure. They  say perhaps from two to five thousand hard core members. Of course the sympathizers  number in the tens of thousands.  WALTERS. The killings and hatred over the  years in the name of God.  RIVERA. So sad, it's so sad, you know, more  people are killed in God's name by Moslem  extremists  and Christian  extremists  and  Jewish extremists and every other kind of  extremist. I mean, if only God could say,  ""Wait a minute,"" you know, ""count me out  of this.""  WALTERS.  I  know  you  don't  have  the  answer, but what can be done about some thing like this?  RIVERA.  If there were something  like a  Vatican II council that Pope John XXIII  had, maybe getting religious leaders of all  persuasions together and saying. ""We won't  tolerate this.""  WALTERS. And even more quickly, newspa per articles,  television editorials,  so  that  there is more light shed on this. Because if  not, it really, without exaggeration, is terri fying.  RIVERA.

1385,562,18,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, I want to  share with my colleagues an article  which appeared in the Rocky Moun tain News. It was written by a good  friend of mine, Morgan Smith, who  serves in Gov. Richard Lamm's admin istration as executive director of the  State department of local affairs.  If there are heroes in government,  Mr. President, surely they are often  found  in  the States. And  in  these  times,  they must  be  particularly  heroic. State officials are caught be tween the demands of federalism and  the challenges of our current econom ic difficulties.  On one hand, State officials are told  by the Federal Government they must  accept more  responsibilities  for pro grams, even as they are provided di minishing resources to finance them.  On the other hand, the crisis on the  farm, the declining competitiveness of  American  exports,  and  the  conse quences of inevitable economic change  have combined to place ever greater  demands on those very programs.  Different States face  that difficult  paradox in a variety of ways. In my  own State of Colorado, however, a gov ernment responsive  to  the needs of  the people has responded creatively.  The Colorado Department of Local  Affairs has listened with special care  to  the voices of people  in  the de pressed farming, mining, and energy  communities. The office has aggres sively sought new opportunities and  options for them to compete and suc ceed  in  this changing economy. By  helping  farmers  identify  new  and  more marketable crops, initiating part nerships among government, colleges,  and the private sector, and bringing  new businesses to the State, the de partment of local affairs has made a  real difference in the lives of Colorad ans.  Morgan Smith  is a good friend of  mine, Mr. President, but he is much  more. Morgan is an exceptional public  servant who has worked long and hard  for the people of my State. He is espe cially  sensitive  to  the  challenges  facing  hard-pressed  rural  communi ties. His comments, in an article titled  ""Small Towns Can't Wait for the Agri cultural Comeback,""  demonstrate  a  keen awareness of their problems and  his dedication to the search for help ful and effective answers. I urge all of  my colleagues  to  read his excellent  statement, which I ask to have printed  in the RECORD.  The material follows:  ",1985

1388,575,18,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?  There was no objection.  ,1985
1389,575,18,Mr. COELHO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in 1983, the Colorado  River experienced unexpectedly high  run-off and flooding, especially along  the  lower portion of  the  river. Al though Federal, State, and local offi cials were able to protect human lives  and the reservoir system, their efforts  were hampered by development along  the river.  Following the 1983 floods, the Inte rior Committee held fields hearings on  the management  of  the Colorado  River. Witnesses testified to the need  for legislation which would designate a  Federal  flood way. That  is,  an area  where development is discouraged and  which could also accommodate heavy  river flows.  H.R. 1246 is the result of those hear ings.  It would  designate  a Federal  floodway from below Davis Dam near  Needles, CA  to  the United States Mexico border.  This legislation will protect lives and  property, save taxpayers money, and  avoid construction of new storage fa cilities in the Colorado River Basin.  The Federal and State Governments  have invested billions of dollars in a  system of reservoirs and other facili ties. Unfortunately, people have built  homes and other structures alongside  the river.  This encroachment has forced  the  Bureau of Reclamation  to keep up stream reservoirs relatively low just in  case there are flood flows. Keeping up stream  reservoirs  artificially  low  to  protect downstream development has  led to wasteful water releases. This bill  will correct this problem by allowing  the Bureau to increase its storage at  upstream reservoirs.  H.R. 1246 would prohibit Federal de velopment-related assistance for new  structures within the floodway. Like  the Coastal Barrier Resources Act  which passed  in  the 97th Congress,  H.R. 1246 will save the Federal Gov ernment money by refusing to insure  those who take the risk and build in  the flood way.  However, the bill doesn't outlaw new  development; it will, however, prohibit  Federal  flood  insurance  and most  forms of disaster assistance for new  structures. The bill  tells developers,  ""Go ahead and build adjacent to the  river, but don't ask the Federal Gov ernment for a bailout"".  To be equitable,  the bill grandfa thers those structures which are al ready built. Federal flood  insurance  within certain limits will remain avail able. Existing structures also will be  conditionally eligible for disaster as sistance.  The Congressional Budget Office es timates the bill will cost $200,000  in  1986 and $400,000 in 1987. However, it  should be noted that these costs are  small  in comparison  to  the savings  which will result from fewer insurance  payments as a result of future floods.  Mr. Speaker,  the Colorado River  Floodway Protection Act will save lives  and protect the taxpayer's investment  in  the Colorado River System. This  bill is also important because it will  improve the management and storage  of water in the Colorado River Basin.  Finally,  I would  like  to point out  that the bill has the strong support of  the Governors and water engineers  from the seven Colorado River Basin  States-California, Wyoming,  Utah,  ",1985

1399,653,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speaker,  we will soon be considering amendments to  the 1985 farm bill. One of the major de bates will occur on the dairy title of the bill  as we choose between the proposals made  in H.R. 2100 and the substitute to be of fered by Mr. OLIN and ",1985
1400,653,18,Mr. MICHEL.," For a  number of reasons which I outlined in the  debate on September 20, 1985, which can be  found at page H7685 of the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD of that date, I will be supporting  the Olin-Michel amendment.  As I stated at that time, our dairy indus try  is  undergoing  a massive  transition,  much of which is driven by improved pro ductivity in that sector. And this productiv ity will accelerate in coming years. Under  the dairy program proposed in H.R. 2100,  this productivity would be used to increase  future dairy surplus problems. Under the  Olin-Michel substitute  this powerful new  technology can be harnessed  to build a  new, healthier dairy sector across the coun try.  Milk production per cow has more than  doubled since 1950. The person-hours re quired to produce 100 pounds of milk had  declined  from 2.36 hours  in 1950  to  less  than 0.5 hours today-a fivefold decrease.  In 1982,  the average milk production per  cow per year was about 12,300 pounds.  Over the next 20 years, we can expect to  see another burst of growth in per-cow pro ductivity as a result of new biotechnology  and  information technologies available to  dairy  farmers. The Office of Technology  Assessment  [OTA]  in  a  recent  report,  ""Technology, Public Policy, and the Chang ing Structure of American Agriculture,""  predicts that by the year 2000, the average  per cow production will  increase  to be tween 17,600 and 19,300 pounds per year an increase of the magnitude seen over the  last 30 years. Even by  the year 1990, the  last year of the Dairy Program that we are  currently considering, production will have  increased to about 14,000 pounds per cow  per year, about a 17 percent increase.  According to  the OTA  report,  the new  biotechnologies will rapidly transform pro duction  in animal agriculture. The major  new development  is  the pending use of  bovine growth hormones [bGH], a lactation  regulator naturally produced in cows. With  new genetic engineering  techniques,  it  is  possible to design microbes to produce bGH  in fermentation tanks, making this product  available at an estimated cost of one dollar  per  injection. Once  injected with bGH, a  by  production  lactating  cow  increases  about 25 percent.  Other,  longer  term biotechnologies  in volve  the  rapid expansion of cow herds  with  genetically  superior  cows  through  embryo transfer and embryo splitting. In  this approach, a genetically superior cow is  given a drug which causes it to supervulate  or produce a number of unfertilized eggs.  These eggs are fertilized with semen from  superior  strains of bulls  and  are  then  placed in surrogate mother cows. In some  cases, the fertilized embryo can be split at  early stages, doubling the number of supe rior embryos to be transferred. The use of  this  technique will have great impact on  speeding the development of superior, high  producing dairy cows.  The use of computers on dairy farms is  also  increasing  production  dramatically.  Current computer programs allow a dairy  farmer  to more closely monitor a dairy  herd and precisely match  feed mixtures  with the lactation cycles of individual cows.  Further developments, already in place on  some farms  in my district,  involve using  these systems together with automatic feed ing stations. The OTA study cites an experi ment  that showed a  2-pound-per-day  in crease in milk production with no addition al feed required.  So what does all of this have to do with  the dairy debate? First, it means that if we  perpetuate  the existing situation, as con tained in H.R. 2100, we will have an even  larger problem on our hands  in 5 years.  Second, it means that what we do this week  on our dairy programs will affect the appli cation  of  these  technologies  over  the  coming decades.  This second point is the most crucial one  to  the  farm bill debate. As  I mentioned  during the general debate, our dairy policy  decisions will have a profound effect on  how  these  new  technologies  are  used.  Under the policy in H.R. 2100, these tech nologies will be exploited to increase total  herd production, given the incentives of a  higher price support. With the prospect of  lower prices, as contained in Olin-Michel,  these technologies will tend to be more fo cused on keeping production steady and  cutting production costs. With the focus on  reducing costs, research and extension ef forts will develop a similar focus, providing  further  dairy  productivity  gains  in  the  future. This cost reduction focus  is found  throughout the research title of H.R. 2100  and should be reflected in the dairy title as  well.  This is not, as some contend, a big farm  versus small farm issue. It is rather an effi.  cient versus inefficient farm matter and the  early adopters of these new  technologies  will ga~n. whether  they are big or small  farms. The low-cost of bGH does not carry  the large capital investment of past productivity increases and, if our extension serv ice does  its  job, will be available  to all  dairy farmers within the next few years.  Some may cite  the fact  that the Dairy  Program in H.R. 2100 takes the productivi ty gain into account, with a modest support  price deflator based on cost of production.  But this is a flawed concept in light of the  new  technologies available soon. The bill  proposes to decrease the support price by  an index that is conservative, even in the  reports of the bill's supporters. It is based  on historical production gains and assumes  capital costs per 100 pounds of production  increase which will not be present with  technologies like bGH. A bGH shot given  every other day at a  cost of $1  a  shot  cannot be called a capital  intensive tech nology.  All of this  leads to the conclusion that  the dairy policy proposed  in H.R. 2100  is  outdated and will become further outdated  in just a few years. It may impede or misdi rect  the application of new  technologies  and drive the dairy farmer in the exact op posite direction needed to insure long-term  survivability. The Olin-Michel proposal has  none of these disincentives and drives the  technology in the right direction. I urge all  of my far-sighted colleagues to support the  Olin-Michel amendment.

Senator  STENNIS, I am advised, is aware of the  action that we are now taking and has  no objection not only to the action but  to it being done at this time.  ",1985
1408,666,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without objection, it is so ordered.  The joint resolution will be stated.  The legislative clerk read as follows:  A joint resolution <H.J. Res. 388> making  continuing appropriations for the fiscal year  1986, and for other purposes.  ",1985

1410,666,18,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, the  continuing  resolution  reported  from  the Appropriations Committee yester day provides  interim funding for all  departments  and  agencies  covered  under  the 13  regular appropriations  bills until November 14,  1985. The  measure was passed by the House last  week  without  extraneous  amend ments, and was reported by our com mittee without amendment.  It is  a  simple, straightforward, clean continu ing resolution, and should be passed  without amendment.  The funding levels for the various  bills are as follows:  Lower  of House  or Senate bills:  Energy and water legislative.  Lower of House or current rate: Ag riculture, Commerce, District of Co lumbia, HUD,  Interior, Transporta tion, and Treasury.  Current rate: Defense, foreign oper ations, Labor-HHS, and military con struction.  Is  Should the Senate pass any of the  bills now on the calendar, the funding  level for  that bill will automatically  shift from the ""lower of House or cur rent rate"" level to the ""lower of House  or Senate bill"" formula.  The resolution also provides for the  continuation of existing provisions of  law regarding the prohibition of feder ally funded abortions and the prohibi tion against preventing the implemen tation of programs of voluntary school  prayer and meditation in the public  schools.  Mr. President, this is a classic con tinuing resolution in that it provides  for the lowest level of funding possible  for continuation of existing programs  and activities for an  interim period,  during which  time  the Senate and  House can complete action on the reg ular appropriations bills. I urge adop tion of the resolution.  ",1985
1411,666,18,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  there any further debate?  ,1985

1414,666,18,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, the  Senate  is  today  considering House  Joint Resolution 388, continuing ap propriations for fiscal year 1986, with out amendment and sent  it  to  the  President  for his  signature.  I  com mend the majority leader, Chairman  HATFIELD, and my Senate colleagues  for acting in a timely fashion to keep  the Federal Government operating for  a 45-day period while  the Congress  completes its consideration of the reg ular  fiscal  year 1986  appropriation  bills.  I would  like  to  insert  into  the  RECORD a table showing the effects of  the Senate version of the continuing  resolution if the levels were funded for  the full fiscal year. My colleagues will  notice that the total of the bill is $9.5  billion  in budget authority and $1.6  billion  in outlays below  the Budget  Committee crosswalk allocation. This  is due to the fact that the bills includ ed in the resolution are funded at the  lower of the Senate-or House-passed  level or the current level, where appro priate.  I must point out, however, that sav ings of $9.9 billion in budget authority  and $4.3 billion in outlays are due to  funding defense programs at the cur rent level. Without this significant un derage,  overall  funding  for Federal  programs would exceed the budget res olution totals, particularly in regard to  outlays.  There being no objection, the table  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  ",1985

",1985
1424,705,18,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, over  the course of my tenure in the Senate,  no single issue has caused me as much  frustration as my continued efforts to  secure adequate staffing levels for the  Seattle  District  Customs  Service  Office. Over the past 10 years, vol umes of passengers and cargoes have  increased  at  unprecedented  rates  through  the  ports  of Seattle  and  Tacoma, the Seattle-Tacoma Interna tional Airport, and our border cross ings at Blaine and Oroville.  During that period, Customs Service  staffing has declined. Just in the last 2  years,  inspection staffing dropped a  full 5 percent, yet revenues collected  in the Seattle district over that same  period increased 37 percent.  For these reasons,  I have offered,  with my distinguished colleague from  Washington, an amendment  to  this  bill to provide an additional 40 perma nent, full time personnel to the Seat tle District Customs Office. I urge my  colleagues  to  join me  in supporting  this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a more detailed justification  for  this proposal be printed  RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  the  in  DOCUMENTATION  FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS  SERVICE INSPECTORS FOR THE SEATTLE DIS TRICT  In any port the international trading com munity can be seen as a chain: a series of  links, each of which is vital to the survival  and prosperity of the others. If one of those  links is weakened or breaks, the entire chain  is threatened. Within the Seattle Customs  District, considerable investment has been  made  by  ports,  shipping  lines,  brokers,  freight forwarders and carriers to enhance  trading capacity and attract new customers  and new  investments. Yet over  the  last  decade, one vital ink of the chain has been  weakened. That link is the Customs Service.  Despite  tremendous growth  in passenger  and cargo volume  through Washington's  ports,  there has been  a  decline  in  the  number of Customs personnel  to  inspect  and classify entries, and to enforce the na tion's laws. That weak link impacts the abil ity of Washington ports to move  imports  and people, and could affect our plans for  attracting new business in the future.  The U.S. Customs Service is one federal  agency which returns more in revenue to  the federal treasury than it costs. For exam ple, last year a $700 million investment re sulted in Customs revenues of more than  $12 billion nationally. Customs  inspectors  return better than $17 to the treasury for  each dollar they receive in salary.  Without adequate Customs staffing, pri vate and non-federal investments designed  to enhance capacity for international trade  can be rendered almost useless. For exam ple, to facilitate cargo and passenger entry,  the Port of Seattle has spent more than $10  million since 1982 at Seattle-Tacoma Inter national Airport to upgrade its internation al arrival area. The facility is now capable  of processing 1,000 passengers and  their  bags every hour. Understaffing by Customs  slows that processing rate to approximately  500 passengers per hour.  In conjunction with Customs, the Port of  Seattle and its customers are participating  in  the  implementation of  the Automated  Commercial System <ACS>,  an electronic  network which facilitates cargo movement  and enhances enforcement efforts. Signifi cant investments have been made by  the  Port, the shipping lines and the brokerage  community in computer technology to inter face with the Customs system. Yet a short age in Customs staffing has created a proc essing bottleneck:  inspectors, who are un trained for the job of data entry, are acting  as input clerks. These inspectors should be  freed to perform the tasks for which they  were trained, and clerks should be hired to  input data. The job would be more quickly  and efficiently performed, and at lower cost.  The shortage of inspectors within the Se attle District could be resolved with the ad dition of sixty new inspection positions.  There are four primary areas within the  Seattle District which  are  understaffed.  They are:  the Blaine border crossing;  the  Tacoma waterfront; the Seattle waterfront;  and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport  <Sea-Tac>.  Staffing should be distributed as follows:  BLAINE  This is America's third busiest northern  border crossing, behind Detroit and BuffaI  and directing that work. It seems to  me that that sort of overhead ratio is  excessive and needs to be corrected.  Mr. President, I think it is well rec ognized  that  the Customs  Service  headquarters  is overstaffed.  I  think  the time is now to correct the situa tion.  I  urge  the  adoption  of  this  amendment.  ",1985
1425,705,18,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, we are  willing to accept the amendment. This  is a goal that Senator DECONCINI and I  have been striving to achieve. It seems  to be a very livable request in the situ ation, and I am happy to accept the  amendment.  ",1985
1426,705,18,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  think the amendment is satisfactory.  I wish to just call to the attention of  the Senator  from Florida  that  the  committee has already cut the head quarter's staff by 30 positions in the  fiscal year 1986, and this cut would  triple that.  I  suspect  that  the Senator  from  Florida is aware of that and that his  own belief and feeling is that that is  not sufficient.  I only wish to say that I hope the  Commissioner will take a close look at  this and report to the committee and  to the Senator from Florida regarding  how he  intends  to  implement  this  amendment because my desire and ob jective is exactly that of the Senator  from Florida, and that is to get the  most people out into the field.  On the other hand, I do not want to  overkill. But I am prepared to accept  this amendment.  ",1985
1427,705,18,Mr. CHILES.,"  I  thank the Senator  from Arizona.  I believe  that we are  transferring those positions  into the  field. We are not cutting the Service,  as such. I think when we look at, sort  of, the tooth to the tail in the Cus toms Service, we can see that there is  a heck of a lot more teeth in the head quarters and we need to get the teeth  out in the field where the job is going  to be done.  The Senator from Arizona, as well as  the Senator from Florida, is continual ly pressing to get some more agents  out there so we can fight on law en forcement matters. We know we need  the trade people out there so we can  get our imports and clear those and  clear our exports. I think that there is  plenty of room to be able to do this.  ",1985
1428,705,18,Mr. DECONCINI.,  I  am willing  to  concur with  the Senator's approach  and objective. I  just wanted to point  out that the committee has not ne glected attempts to cut headquarters  staff.  ,1985
1429,705,18,Mr. CHILES., I believe the commit tee has worked in this regard already.  ,1985
1430,705,18,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  I  believe  the  Senator  from  Florida  makes a good point, that it is not a cut  of personnel in Customs. That is not  the answer. We are just transferring  people to the field. So I am willing to  accept the amendment.  51-059 0-86-23 (Pt. 18)  ",1985
1431,718,18,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  this  week the Polish ruler, General Jaru zelski, is visiting the United States in  order  to  participate  in  this  year's  opening proceedings of the U.N. Gen eral Assembly. Since December 1981,  when martial  law was  imposed,  the  Polish free  labor and human rights  movements have been subjected to cy clical swings between supression and  halting moderation. Unfortunately, of  late the pendulum has swung toward  greater and greater repression.  Three Solidarity and human rights  activists-Adam Michnik, Bogdan Lis,  and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk-were  ar rested earlier this summer for disturb ing the public order. The three had  called for a strike, which never took  place. The  trial's proceedings were  heavily  censored,  and was open  in  name  only. Their  sentences  range  from 2¥2 to 3¥2 years.  This year saw not only the trial and  renewed incarceration of these three,  but an increase in the number of polit ical prisoners and a further tightening  of the penal code. Human rights are  being steadily abused in Poland, nnd  the U.S. Congress cannot let this in crease in civil strife go unnoticed. It is  imperative that we let the Polish Gov ernment know, in no uncertain terms,  that we  cherish human  rights and  that it remains an important part of  our foreign policy agenda.  On October 13, Solidarity and three  other free unions plan to boycott the  Polish  legislative  elections.  I  don't  want to get into the position of en dorsing this boycott or condemning it;  it would be best if Solidarity were un shackled and worker-government ne gotiations  resumed. But  I  do know  that United  States-Polish  relations  continue  to be  strained by worker  unrest and government harassment in  Poland, and that a real need exists to  convey  this message  to  the highest  Polish  authorities.  This  resolution  does just that, by calling on the Presi dent to express congressional concerns  directly to the Government of Poland,  to the Soviet Union, and to ask our  allies to encourage Polish moderation  and respect for human rights.e  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED  duction of the alcoholic beverage and tobac co industries below FY 1985 levels.

1432,731,18,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, while  many farmers struggle to keep their  farms, our small,  rural communities  are also struggling for their very exist ence. As these towns die, so, too, does  a part of all of us. In a weekly column  I write for newspapers in my State, I  have written about a recent weekend  in  Illinois when  this  lesson was  brought home to me. I ask that the ar ticle be printed in the REcoRD.  The article follows:  A SMALL-TOWN STORY  Small  town America contributes  some thing important to the nation. I saw that re cently in a dramatic way.  A few months ago Sen. Barry Goldwater  asked me, ""Have you ever heard of Bowen,  illinois?"" I told him I thought I knew every  small town in Illinois but that I could not  place Bowen.  ""My mother was born there,"" he told me.  I  looked up Bowen and found it was a  town of 539 people in Hancock County near  Macomb.  I had a sign made: ""Welcome to Bowen,  Home of Josephine Williams, Mother of  Sen. Barry Goldwater."" It's at the four-way  stop-the only four-way stop-in Bowen.  I presented  it  to Mayor Ronald Moor mann, and gave Sen. Goldwater a copy of a  picture of the sign.  He told me, ""I have to go to Bowen.""  And last Saturday <as I type this> he went  there.  It was like an old Saturday Evening Post  cover. The distinguished former presidential  candidate fit into the small town like a hand  in a glove. He liked Bowen, and the people  of Bowen liked him.  Mter a parade through the few blocks of  Bowen a reception was held in the small vil lage park in the center of town.. Several  hundred people gathered to listen to the  most famous person with a direct  tie  to  Bowen.  Sen. Goldwater's grandparents were mar ried  in  the nearby  town of Liberty. His  mother was born in the country near Bowen  in a home that no  longer exists,  though  Barry had a chance to see the farm land on  which it once stood.  As we drove from the Quincy airport to  Bowen,  the Arizona  senator  commented  about the importance of rural America to  the country. He spoke of the values his  mother received and passed on to him from  that small town.  A disproportionately high number of the  nation's leaders  in every profession come  from small towns.  That does not mean that big cities aren't  important. They are. Big cities and small  towns are like big rivers and the creeks that  feed  them. And ultimately if those creeks  have problems, so do the rivers.  In Bowen, Barry Goldwater and I heard  about the farm problem again and again  and again.  One young farm wife told me she thought  that 90 percent of the farmers in Hancock  County had almost lost hope. That may be  too high a  figure, but desperation  is out  there.  If a sensible federal farm program does  not emerge, Bowen will shrink and so will  opportunity for a great many Americans all  over this country.  I do not agree with Barry Goldwater on  everything.  But he's a great American.  Part of that greatness was nurtured in  ways we can never know in a small town in  Illinois.  If we lose those small towns, inevitably we  will lose some opportunities for greatness.  And all Americans will lose, no matter  where they live.e  THE KIDS WHO BROUGHT  ELECTRICITY TO HIGHWOOD  e ",1985
1433,731,18,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I wish  to share with my colleagues a hum bling example of achievement. Forty seven  years  ago,  electricity  was  brought to the small town of High wood, MT. At  that  time, Highwood  had only 150 people and was 70 miles  from  the nearest  town. When  their  nearest neighbor first got electricity,  the electric glow  could be  seen at  night but, none of the  town people  threw out  their gas  lamps because  they knew  that Highwood was  too  small to convince the power company  to bring electricity to it. So, gas lamps  continued to be used in the school, the  store,  and  the  community  hall.  Nobody even tried to bring electricity  to Highwood.  Highwood did not have electricity  until the 13 teenagers, who were High wood's eight grade, entered a citizen ship  contest. The  class wanted  to  make their town just as good a place  to live in as any other in the United  States by bringing electricity  to  it.  These children wrote  to  the Rural  Electrification Administration,  held  town meetings, and sold the idea of  electricity to their community. I  join  the people of  that region who are  grateful to those 13 who brought elec tricity to that 500 square mile area in  1940. Adults did not even believe  in  trying, whereas children not only tried  but succeeded. We should be proud of  their ingenuity, dedication, and abili ty.  I ask to have printed in the RECORD  a recent Rural Electrification account  of their achievement.  The account follows:  THE KIDS WHO BROUGHT ELECTRICITY To  HIGHWOOD  <By Martin L. Erickson>  ""We started out to win a prize, but we  don't care about  that now,""  the eighth  grade class  in Highwood, MT, wrote in a  letter to REA. ""All we want is electricity for  our town and community and to make it  just as good a place to live in as any other in  the United States.""  There were 13 boys and girls  in  that  eighth grade Current Events class that en tered a citizenship contest. The topic was  community betterment, and the prize was  $100-a lot of money in 1938.  In the Depression, as now, Highwood was  a  tiny place with maybe 150 people. The  town sits in the Big Sag, or valley, the an cient bed of the Missouri River, which now  courses 15 to 20 miles to the north. High wood is at the southern tip of Montana's  Golden Triangle,  the  rich  grain-growing  region that extends almost to the Canadian  border.  Forty-seven years later, on a sunny spring  morning, I sat down and talked to two of  the class members-rancher Miles Swan and  Lucille Walker, a  cook at  the Highwood  Cafe-to find out how they brought electric ity to their isolated community in central  Montana.  ""Rural electrification was hot then. The  time was right,"" Swan recalled ""We met  with Carl Gunderson-he was the superin tendent of  schools  in Highwood-to  see  what might be a project we could work on.  A water system was out; the town wasn't in corporated. A sewer system was voted down;  it wouldn't affect the whole community. We  talked  about  telephones, but everything  seemed to center around electricity.""  ""Electricity for the school was a big thing  in our minds,"" Walker said. ""Our school  lighting was with gas lamps. Ben Gossack's  store had a gasoline engine generator as did  the Community Hall. Charlie Berkner's  meat market had gas lamps.""  The students voted to write to the Rural  Electrification Administration  in  faraway  Washington. REA  responded  that,  yes,  Highwood  could have  electricity, but  it  would take an organized community effort.  The nearest rural electric cooperative was  in Fairfield, 70 miles to the west. Halfway in  between was Great Falls,  the  ""Electric  City,"" where  there had been  lights and  power since 1912, when the first of four hy droelectric dams was built on the Missouri  River. At night, the ranchers and dry land  farmers in the Highwood area could see the  glow of Great Falls' lights, but they knew  that it was a pipe dream to think that they  would get lights anytime soon. The power  company in Great Falls sure wasn't going to  do it for them.  The 13 eighth graders ignored that sensi ble adult conclusion. and spent the winter of  1938-39 doing what they later told REA was  their hardest job: ""getting our parents and  the people of the town interested in electric ity."" In February, they held a community  meeting, and it attracted people from miles  around. Mter that school board Chairman  Ben Gossack, Floyd Davidson and ""Torchy""  Swan (Miles's dad) did most of the organiz ing, although the kids stayed close to the  project,  attending  all  the meetings  and  making certain ""everything got to Washing ton all right.""  One of the first things the adults did was  to arrange a meeting with Sun River Elec tric Cooperative and REA. Out of it came  the idea of extending a line from Fairfield,  which REA later financed with a $69,000  loan.  Swan's family was one of the first in the  community  to appreciate what electricity  could do for  their lives: ""Our ranch was  seven miles out of  town on  the South  Bench,"" he said. ""We knew what electricity  could do since we had a 32-volt light plant  at the ranch. I went out night after night  with my dad when he signed up people in  the North Bench and Shonkin areas.  ""Dad had  to explain everything  to  the  prospective members. Each pitch  took an  hour or more; but dad said he could sign up  three people a night from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M.  Of all  the people he talked  to, only  two  didn't sign up.  ""At first REA said we needed three con sumers per mile and a membership fee of  $4.50. Dad, with the help of our class, who  wrote the letters, got the REA to change  the rules to one person per mile, but the  sign-up was $10.50. To tell you the truth, it  stretched it to get one person per mile.""  ",1985
1434,744,18,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of S. 1671, which would provide inter im extensions of the authority of the V eter ans' Administration to operate a  regional  office  in the Republic of the Philippines,  contract for care of nonservice-connected  veterans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is lands, contract for treatment and rehabili tation services  for alcohol and drug de pendence and abuse disabilities, and amend  the Emergency Veterans' Job Training Act  of 1983  to extend the period for entering  into training under such act.  H.R. 2343, which passed  the House on  May 20, extended the authority of the Ad ministrator to operate a regional office in  the Republic of the Philippines. H.R. 505,  as amended, which passed  the House on  May 21 contained an extension of the VA's  authority to contract with halfway houses  and other community  treatment facilities  for treatment of veterans with alcohol or  drug abuse problems from September 30,  1985, to September 30, 1988, as well as a 3year extension of the V A's authority  to  contract for care of non-service-connected  veterans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is lands, and a 3-year phaseout of the so called extraordinary authority to contract  at levels which exceed levels of comparable  service  in  the 48 contiguous States. H.R.  1408, which passed the House on May 20,  extended the deadline by which a veteran  participant must be enrolled in a job train ing program from September 1, 1985,  to  July 1, 1986.  The Senate  acted  upon H.R.  505,  as  amended, with an amendment in the nature  of a substitute containing the language of  S. 876 on July 30. The extension provisions  contained in H.R. 1408 and S. 2343, which I  mentioned above, were a part of the Senate  amendments to H.R. 505, as amended.  The differences in the House and Senate  versions of these various measures are now  being worked out in informal negotiation.  As we all know, the end of the fiscal year  1985 occurs on September 30. S. 1671 would  provide a 30-day interim extension of the  programs discussed above until these dif ferences can be resolved, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.  ",1985
1435,744,18,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of S. 1671. The interim extensions  provided in this bill are necessary to ensure  that several important programs which are  facing expiration are not terminated. I do  want to express, however, my disappointment in the extension provided in this leg islation for the Emergency Veterans' Job  Training Act [EVJTA].  On May  20,  the House  unanimously  passed H.R. 1408, a bill to extend and im prove  the  program  established  under  EV JTA. This highly successful program has  placed over 36,000  long-term unemployed  veterans of the Vietnam era and Korea in  stable, permanent  jobs.  In passing H.R.  1408, the House expressed its desire to pro vide an extended period of time for veter ans to be placed in approved programs of  job training and an opportunity for addi tional veterans  to participate  in EVJTA.  Under S. 1671, however, only the date by  which a veteran must enter employment is  extended. No provision  is made  to allow  new veterans to be certified for participa tion under EVJTA.  A recent indepth report, which evaluated  the operation and impact of the Emergency  Veterans' Job Training Act Program, had  high praise for this program, both in terms  of veteran and employer satisfaction with  EVJTA. Job service offices  from around  the country have  indicated  their  strong  support for extending EVJTA but make it  clear that legislation should include an ad vancement of the date for new entrants as  well as the date by which a certified veter an must enter training. Their reason for re questing new veterans is quite simple-the  remaining number of certified veterans is  not adequate to meet employer demands.  Additionally, they point out that there are  thousands of eligible veterans who contin ue to seek employment assistance but who  cannot be certified because the cutoff for  new entrants was February 28, 1985.  The limited extension provided inS. 1671  is a stopgap measure which allows for the  continuance of EVJTA while  the other  body  further  considers  its  position  on  EVJTA. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Com mittee held hearings on veterans employ ment issues recently, with particular em phasis on EVJTA, and it is my hope that  the  testimony presented at  that hearing  convinced our colleagues in the other body  that Vietnam era and Korean conflict vet erans deserve  the opportunity for assist ance in their efforts to find meaningful and  stable employment.

1439,757,18,Mr. HEFTEL of Hawaii.," Mr. Chair man,  the sugar program  is working  well. Our sugar producers are operat ing at peak efficiency. and are. in fact.  among the most efficient sugar pro duction industries in the world. The  sugar program  assures not only  a  stable supply of sugar but a steady  price to consumers. Yet, the Downey Gradison amendment is proposing to  guarantee destruction of this Ameri can industry because the sugar refin ery industry thinks that if we have no  sugar industry they will be able to buy  all the sugar they need at less than 5  cents a pound.  Removal  of  the  sugar  program  would not result in free trade. On the  contrary,  there  is  ample  indication  that sugar will never be freely traded.  The European Economic Community  [EECl pays its farmers 22 cents per  pound  to  produce  sugar. Colombia  pays its farmers 21 cents a pound, and  the American Government guarantees  its farmers 17o/"" cents per pound for  sugar.  The United States consumes all the  sugar it produces. The major sugar  producing countries in the world, in cluding the EEC countries, Brazil, and  Australia receive such generous subsi dies to produce more sugar than they  need that they dump their surplus on  the world market.  This chronic oversupply of  sugar  does not lower the price of sugar, how ever, because cartels control the world  sugar trade. Sugar is not now, never  has been, and never will be  freely  traded, regardless of what the United  States does. If we lose our sugar indus try. we will totally lose control over  the price we pay for sugar. It is not  likely that the end result of the loss of  our  industry will  be  lower  prices.  Rather, we will be controlled the same  way we are controlled by other inter national cartels, including the coffee  and oil cartels. It costs European tax payers $350 per ton in sugar subsidies.  How  long can we  realistically  think  that our foreign neighbors will contin ue to provide such heavy subsidies to  their farmers?  In reviewing 8 years of falling sugar  prices in the latter half of the seven ties and the early eighties, nowhere is  there evidence of a drop in the price of  sugar products. Manufacturers have  used  increases  in sugar prices as an  excuse to raise prices, yet decreases in  sugar prices never seem to be translat ed down. Rather,  lower sugar prices  are used  to offset other production  costs to avoid decrP.asing manufactur ers profit margins. J:l,ood processing in dustries have become among the most  profitable  industries  in  the Nation.  with  the  soft drink manufacturers  leading with a profit margin of 27.5  percent. Yet domestic sugar prices are  blamed for high prices to consumers.  Where is there reason to think that  our consumers would benefit from not  having a domestic sugar program?  Our current sugar program is a rea sonable response to ensure the viabili ty of  the U.S.  sugar  industry  in a  world marketplace that bases its sell ing price on neither the free market  nor actual costs of production. Repeal  of this system would not provide con sumers with  the  benefit  of  lower  prices.  It makes no sense to tamper with a  program  that  has  protected  our  Nation from highly fluctuating sugar  prices and dependence on the whims  of foreign countries.  I urge you  to  reject  the Downey-Gradison  sugar  amendment to the 1985 farm bill.  0 1120  ",1985
1440,757,18,Mr. HUCKABY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan [Mr. TRAxLER].  ",1985
1441,757,18,Mr. TRAXLER.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, sugar in the area of  the country that I come from is akin  to  the Bible,  and  this amendment  clearly is heresy. Sugar and a domestic  sugar program provides substance and  income to the American sugar growers,  the sugar farmers. I represent 2,000 of  them in my district, and it is the only  bright spot in their economic horizon;  it is  the only place where  they are  going to make any money this year.  Now, through this amendment, if you  force my growers out of production  and into other crops, you are going to  pay for  it through greater subsidies  for com and wheat. That is their alter native to beets. The land is not going  to stand idle.  The second point I want to make is  this: There are two points that I think  the authors of this amendment make.  First, that it is good for consumers. I  categorically deny that. That is false;  it is not true. Second, we ought to do  this for the benefit of the Caribbean  nations so they can make their pay ments to the Wall Street international  bankers. It is the first time I have ever  heard an argument on the floor of the  House that said, ""Hey, we want to in crease our trade deficit; it is good for  us:   That  is absurd. Absolutely  ridicu lous. I cannot believe a Member of this  House would stand on the floor and  make that suggestion. We do not need  to  increase our  foreign  trade debt,  which is now $130 billion. We need to  decrease  it. We do not need to buy  more overseas; we need to buy less. We  need to produce more in America.  Currently, nearly half of the sugar  that is consumed  in  this country  is  produced  in  this country. We  give  away almost half of  it; how much  more do you want? You  talk about  jobs, what are you going to do for the  1,000 people that work in my produc tion facilities? What are you handing  them besides an unemployment check?  What are you doing for the 2,000 farm  families who are making their mort gage payments. That  is  the human  side of this.  What about the consumer side? Do  you tell me that in the midseventies,  when the price of sugar went to all time highs of 75 cents a pound, fol lowed by a dramatic drop down to 9  cents a pound, that the price of candy.  or pop, or whatever dropped with it?  Are  the CEo s  of  those companies  paid to cut profits or are they paid to  make money?  I  leave  that for your  judgment. The fact of the matter is  the consumer did not benefit. The con sumer did not get the break when the  price dramatically dropped at  that  point in time.  What about other countries? The  Canadians pay their producers virtual ly  the same  thing as we pay ours.  They  subsidize  their  industry  the  same way we do. The reason they do  that is because they recognize the ben efit of having a domestic sweetener in dustry, and we have, and we do, and  we will.  What about Brazil? They set prices  related to production costs. Australia  has an import embargo;  local prices  are controlled. Thailand maintains a  domestic sugar price  five  times  the  world price. The European Economic  Community, boy, this is a good one.  They pay about 28 cents a pound to  their producers, and then they sell it  at the world price on the world market  to New York, and get this: What they  sell it for does not even pay them the  cost of transporting it from their stor age bins to the port.  How can we possibly compete?  In  conclusion. please reject the Downey Gradison amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from  New York [Mr. DOWNEY] and the gentle man from Ohio [Mr. GRADISON].  I want to urge all of our colleagues to  vote against this amendment and to sup port the House Agriculture Committee's po sition on the continuation of the sugar pro gram because it is the right thing to do.  The amendment's sponsors would have  us believe  that  if their amendment suc ceeds, sugar prices will come down for our  consumers,  the  free market will prevail,  and only a small number of people will be  hurt. All of these assertions are false, and I  want to tell you why.  First, the idea that sugar prices will come  down is based on the belief that commer cial sugar users will pass on the savings to  their customers. History tells us that this  ",1985

I am not able to do  so at this time, but it does not dimin ish my respect for his point of view.  The gentleman has said many things  that are absolutely  true about  the  dairy industry. It is the most produc tive industry in the country. We ought  to be thankful for the dairy industry  that we have and for the fact  that  they have had the great productivity  improvement that they have. We want  to continue to see that they provide us  with the benefit of that great produc tivity improvement.  At this point I would like to pay my  respects to the distinguished chairman  of the subcommittee, because I think  he has done an excellent job also.  Of course, the gentleman knows that  this is a prelude to saying that I do  not agree with him in his opposition to  the Olin-Michel amendment.  ",1985
1445,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," The gentleman can  take the whole 5 minutes doing that, if  he wants to.  ",1985
1446,783,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," Specifi cally, after my heartfelt complimenta ry remarks, I wanted to refer back to  that chart that the gentleman used  with regard to milk prices and how  they have gone up less than the rate  of increase in the cost of living. Could  we see that?  ",1985
1447,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," That chart is avail able, yes.  ",1985
1448,783,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," I wanted  to point out one thing with regard to  that chart, which is interesting, and it  may bear on this situation.  The ""all dairy foods,""  line on the  chart is of course, a composite and I  presume  that it  includes fresh milk  prices, butter, cheese, and the other  components.  ",1985
1449,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS., That is correct.  ,1985
1450,783,18,Mr. BROWN of California.," I have a  table here showing dairy prices for the  last 10 years, and it bears out the gen tleman's chart, I am not trying to con tradict it, but it shows this with regard  to the components:  Over the last 10 years,  fluid milk  prices, which are not regulated by the  support prices established in this bill,  but are regulated by regional market ing orders, have gone up 53 percent,  way below the increase in the cost of  living.  Butter prices, on  the other hand,  have gone up 105 percent. It is the av erage of those two that the gentleman  has on his chart there, plus the cheese  prices. It is butter that we have several  hundred million pounds of surplus in  storage, and it is cheese that we have  several hundred million pounds of sur plus in storage, while  the price has  gone up over 100 percent as compared  with a 50 percent increase in the price  of fluid milk, which is not governed by  the price support that we are legislat ing here.  0 1355  I wonder  if  the gentleman would  concur with me that this represents  the final detail of his red line there on  all dairy prices?  ",1985
1451,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I have no problem  and will not quarrel with the gentle man on the specifics that he is talking  about, other than to say that, at least  until very recently, we have had very  little butter stores. There are some  now as a result of the end of the diver sion.  ",1985
1452,783,18,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1453,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from Texas.  ,1985
1454,783,18,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman, I  do so  to make mention of one fact.  Probably throughout this amendment  and the rest of the bill, we will be  hearing  the phrase  called  ""market  clearing."" Somehow this gives the con notation that it is good for the farmer,  the dairy farmer, or the wheat farmer,  the producer of any kind. It is not.  What market clearing means is that  you sell at the dump price, regardless  of your cost of production.  So I wanted the membership and my  colleagues  to  remember now when  someone says market clearing,  that  means  that it is detrimental  to  the  producer, because market clearing has  no respect or regard for the cost of  production. And the fact is, and the  history is, as my colleague from Cali fornia  respectfully mentioned about  the great productivity. As the gentle man knows, in the mid-1970's, we were  flat running out of milk. We had to  chase around the world to our friends  and our allies saying, ""Hey, send milk,  send milk.""  Why were we running out of milk?  Because the price had escalated on the  grains and  the feed because of  the  Russian grain deal. And the farmer sat  there, the milk producer with no con trol over it whatsoever.  That  is part of  the history  that  brought us to where we are now, be cause they came to the Congress. We  need to do something.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from Vermont  [Mr.  JEF FORDS] has again expired.  <On request of Mr. DE LA GARZA, and  by unanimous consent, Mr. JEFFORDS  was allowed to proceed for 3 additional  minutes.)  ",1985
1455,783,18,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," So they came to  us, and with human error, we overcor rected and it enticed some people in.  Then when we saw  that,  then we  started,  and  the  gentleman was  a  major partner  in  the  endeavor  of  starting to reduce again, and to bring  also another phrase that you might  hear throughout the debate which is  supply and demand. No, it should be  demand and supply. This is what we  are trying to do with our basic com mittee legislation, that we look at the  demand, that the Secretary looks at  the demand  and  then we,  to  the  extent we can, put supply in.  I do not know why they say supply  and demand. It should be demand and  supply. And the gentleman has worked  assiduously in that respect.  So I want to put it into perspective  so that we do not go off, and we know  what happened. We were running out  of milk. We know why we are here, be cause we  overcompensated. We  are  now trying to bring it back.  The fact is that also will be men tioned about the free market. No free  market. Every other country in the  world that produces milk and its deriv ative products subsidizes. We try to do  the best we can utilizing the farmer  cooperation by investing, by reducing,  and that is why we need to remain in  support of the committee version.  I thank the gentleman.  ",1985
1456,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I thank the gentle man.  I  just want  to point out  in  that,  during that period in the 1970's, it was  milk support price cuts that exacer bated the problem. They were put on  at exactly the wrong time. This com mittee  program  a  cautious  one  which will prevent that kind of rever sal in the event we do get a change in  the grain situation.  ",1985
1457,783,18,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1458,783,18,Mr. JEFFORDS., I will be happy to  yield  to  the gentleman  from South  Dakota.  ,1985
1459,783,18,Mr. DASCHLE.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  Much has already been said, begin ning, of course, with the very eloquent  and persuasive statements made by  the gentleman  from Vermont,  fol lowed by the gentleman from Wiscon sin, and certainly the gentleman from  Texas, our chairman. Most of the con fusion may come about from Members  who may be listening to the argument  posed by the gentleman from Virginia  [Mr. OLIN]  that by cutting the price  support, we may be cutting the cost of  the program. No one should fall for  is  ",1985
1460,796,18,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in  opposition to the amendment offered by my  good friends and colleagues, Congressmen  OLIN and MICHEL. This amendment would  devastate the dairy industry in New York,  and all across the Nation.  New York State is the third largest pro ducer of dairy products in the country. In  1983, alone, 15,316 dairy farms sold $1,574  billion worth of milk. The bad news is that  the industry is in deep economic trouble.  More  than 34 percent of the New York  dairy  farms  operating during  1970,  no  longer exist.  Because the issues reflected in the 1985  farm bill hold such importance for dairy men in my State and across the country;  and because my State does not have repre sentation on the Agriculture Committee; I  have worked closely with  the committee  and  the  agriculture  community  in New  York to develop a proposal which would  reduce the dairy surplus, meet our budget  goals, and preserve our dairy  industry. I  spent a great deal of time analyzing the  various proposals and am convinced that  the committee title offers the best opportu nity for our farmers.  Recent debate on these proposals has fo cused on their expense to the Federal Gov ernment. I,  too, am concerned about the  budget deficit, but believe that this concern  must be weighed  against  the  impact of  these proposals on our  farmers. Simply  stated over the course of 3 years, the Olin Michel amendment will reduce farm cash  receipts by nearly 30 percent. This  isn't  right and it isn't fair.  The Agriculture Committee bill, which is  supported by a m~Qority of the farm groups  in my home State of New York, is not per fect. It contains some provisions that are  difficult to support. It does, however, offer  the best available option for reducing the  dairy surplus, meeting our budget goals,  and protecting our domestic dairy industry.  I urge my colleagues to join me in oppos ing this amendment and support the com mittee bill.  ",1985
1461,796,18,Mr. TRAXLER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition  to  the amendment offered by  Mr. OLIN and Mr. MICHEL, and in support  of the dairy program contained in the com mittee's bill, as amended with a 50 cents  per hundredweight  limit on the dairy as sessment.  Over the past few months, I have met  with dairy farmers in my district, some of  whom are proponents and others who are  opponents of this amendment. It is  they  who are most affected by our decisions  here today, and for this reason it is they  who should be my closest advisers on this  issue.  Their m~Qority message to me was very  clear: They support what the committee has  recommended, particularly with  the  limit  of 50 cents per hundredweight on the as sessment. They do not believe that cutting  support prices will do enough alone to cut  production to end the difficulties we have  with dairy production. Instead a very large  m~Qority of my dairy farmers tell me that if  their price is cut, they will have to increase  their production in order to maintain their  economic viability.  They also tell me that the ability to sell  entire herds under the whole-herd buy-out  provisions will do more  to  reduce dairy  production quickly than any other provi sion of  the dairy program, and  that  it  would be a mistake to delete this provision.  The dairy farmers of Michigan's Eighth  Congressional District say that balancing  the Federal budget will help  improve the  economic climate  in which  they operate,  and give them the chance to survive. For  this  reason  they  teD me  that we  should  resist any expensive farm programs that do  not have adequate concern for budgetary  costs.  The amendment before us according to  very reliable estimates exceeds  the  limits  imposed by our House and Senate passed  budget resolution by $500 million in fiscal  1986. To adopt this amendment is to ignore  our concern about the budget.  President Reagan has also said that if the  cost of this farm bill exceeds certain levels  he will veto it. It would be a great disserv ice to our farmers for us to adopt a provi sion whose cost could invite such a veto.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that we have an  obligation  to  represent  the views of our  constituents. Having heard from my dairy  farmer constituents,  including some who  support the Olin-Michel approach, on bal ance I find that in order to represent the  m~Qority will of my dairy constituents  I  must oppose this amendment and urge my  colleagues to support the dairy provisions  contained in the committee's bill.  ",1985
1462,796,18,Mrs. LONG.," Mr. Chairman, I  stand  in  support of  the Olin-Michel  amendment.  The dairy farmers in the State of Louisiana  are adamantly opposed to one of the m~or  provisions of the dairy title: the diversion  program. The  implementation of a diver sion program is not the most direct and ef fective method to cut dairy production. We  should remove the incentive to overproduce  via meaningful cuts  in the price support  system. Why should farmers who have es tablished an efficient operation pay for the  inefficiencies in the dairy industry? There  are farmers in States, such as Louisiana,  that do not produce huge surpluses. They  are not willing to have their profit margins  taxed away through assessments or be a fi nancial burden on the Federal Government  at a  time when self-sufficiency  is needed.  Also, with the adoption of the current dairy  provisions, retail milk prices will increase  more than under the Olin-Michel amend ment. The higher milk prices  inherent in  the dairy title will result in increased costs  of the Food Stamp Program, the WIC Pro gram and Child Nutrition Programs. These  increased costs mean  fewer poor women  and children will be able to participate in  these  programs. Again,  I  urge my  col leagues to support the Olin-Michel amend ment.  0 1515  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Virginia [Mr. OLIN].  The question was  taken; and  the  Chairman announced  that  the ayes  appeared to have it.  RECORDED VOTE  ",1985

1470,809,18,Mr.  COELHO.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  would like the gentleman to know that  we  appreciate  very much  that he  brings up this amendment. In our dis cussions with subcommittee members,  we have no objection to the amend ment. We accept it as amended.  ",1985
1471,809,18,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for that state ment.  I yield to the gentleman from Ver mont.  ",1985
1472,809,18,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  also concur. I have no objection to my  knowledge on this side.  I would additionally like to point out  that since the original proposal was  added to the bill to assist in the beef  producers and others  to be able  to  adjust to what might occur under the  dairy bill, we have also added a whole herd buy-out which will give the Sec retary  the discretion as  to when  to  phase in the meat out of the market,  which should also greatly reduce any  concerns that the beef producers and  others might have. Certainly this with  the  addition  of  the  gentleman's  amendment ought to remove most if  any concerns they have left.  ",1985
1473,809,18,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank  the gentleman  for his state ment.  In conclusion, I would just say that I  believe this is a move in the direction  of fairness. I very much appreciate the  committee's work on it.  During fiscal year 1984, the USDA  purchased 220 million pounds for food  nutrition programs and for the school  lunch program. The move to 250 mil lion pounds is within the budget con straints and I believe it is within the  range of the expected loss to the red  meat industry of somewhere between  242 and 267 million pounds.  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment  today in the interest of fair treatment for  ranchers and livestock feeders of this coun try who will be impacted by this dairy bill.  I would point out to my colleagues that  the cattle  industry  is  the  last bastion of  free market agriculture that we have left in  this country. This farm bill seems to have  something  in  it for every  farm program  from  eggs  to watermelons, but  I would  point out that there is very little in this bill  for  the  livestock  industry. The one  item  that they have requested is the $1 checkoff  for a beef promotion program, but this is a  program which the livestock producers are  paying themselves-not the consumers or  the taxpayers.  The other major provision of this bill  which an impact on the livestock industry  is, of course, the provision in the dairy bill  for a dairy diversion/whole-herd buyout.  I  recognize  that the committee has at tempted to address the problems that are  created for cattlemen if a large number of  dairy cattle are sent to slaughter. The com mittee has included in the bill a provision  to require the Federal Government to pur chase up  to $200 million pounds of red  meat  in  the event of diversion. While  I  think this is certainly a correct and neces sary approach,  I  have  reservations  that  such amount is adequate to offset the nega tive market  impact  that a diversion will  have on the livestock industry.  By my own estimates, if the total number  of dairy  cows  are  culled-770,000-this  would cause more than 250 million pounds  of meat to hit the market. Actually during  fiscal year 1984, the USDA purchased 220  million pounds for the school  lunch and  other nutritional programs, excluding the  purchases by  the Defense Department.  I  understand that my amendment to increase  the purchase of red meat by 50 million  pounds is within the budget constraints.  But beyond actual displacement  in the  marketplace, there is also the psychological  impact that a diversion/whole-herd buyout  will have on the market price of beef.  In 1983, when we passed the last dairy  bill with a diversion there was an immedi ate  psychological  impact  on  livestock  market prices. Within 1 month, market  prices for beef cattle dropped between $8 to  $10 per hundredweight. This drop occurred  not because we immediately had thousands  of dairy cows coming  to  the market. It  dropped for psychological reasons, people  anticipated a  large number of dairy cows  being culled. After a few months, everyone  realized that participation in the diversion  was not as high as originally anticipated  and  the market price for beef producers  eventually increased. However, the damage  had already been done.  In the fall of 1983, the dairy bill, coupled  with the impact of the PIK Program, pro vided a double whammy which devastated  many of the ranchers and livestock feeders  in my State and across the Nation. Many of  these producers did not survive these pro grams and have since gone out of business.  Today, we are on the verge of recreating  this scenario all over again, 2 years ago,  cattle prices fell  from almost $70/cwt  to  below $60/cwt. Today, prices for steers on  the Omaha market are hovering close  to  $50/cwt., when just a year ago  they were  close  to $65/cwt. My  cattle  feeders  are  losing nearly $150/head on the cattle they  send to market.  All through this debate on the farm bill  we will hear grim  stories and  statistics  about how different sectors of agriculture  are going through d._mcult economic times.  But I can assure you that no sector of agri culture is having a more difficult time than  the ranchers and cattlemen in this country.  For my State of Nebraska, the economic  problems of the cattle industry are com pounding the economic difficulties we are  facing in Nebraska because receipts from  the sale of cattle account for over one-hP.lf  of all agricultural  receipts. While wheat,  com, soybeans and yes, dairy are impor tant to my State, there is no question that  cattle still reign supreme in Nebraska and  many other States.  During the past 6 months my office has  been visited by producers from every imag inable sector of agriculture asking, if not  demanding,  that  certain  programs  and  prices be included in this bill. But the cat tlemen have not asked for one thing in this  bill which would cost the consumer or the  taxpayer one dime.  The increase that I ask for in this dairy  bill is not an unreasonable request for an  industry that provides so much, yet asks  for so little. It is fair if the issue of a diver sion was not before us, we would not need  to address the red meat issue. But the di version is before us, and all that I ask is  that America's cattlemen be reasonably in sulated from the negative impact that a di version will create for them.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment, as modified, offered  by the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr.  BEREUTER].  The amendment, as modified, was  agreed to.  Mr. DORGAN  of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, putting  together  a  farm  bill  under the current circumstances was not  easy. On one hand, we have a seriously de pressed farm economy. My own State of  North Dakota has  lost over 4,000  farms  since 1980. On the other, we are looking at  a bumper harvest of grain, which will, iron ically, further depress prices. The situation  is  the same  in  the dairy  industry. Dairy  ",1985

1476,822,18,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker, the issue  of record high levels of imports arriving on  our shores daily,  leading  to  record high  deficits  and  excessive  unemployment of  manufacturing jobs, has become a national  concern. With an obvious lack of concern  by the administration and, up until now, a  failure on  the part of Congress  to act,  much has been left to the American citi zens who are making themselves aware of  the problem and are taking it upon them sevles to make others, including this Con gress, aware of the need to ""Buy Ameri can"" and to take swift and positive correc tive action.  A perfect example of the type of commu nity concern for this problem is being dem onstrated right now in Steubenville, OH, in  my  congressional  district. A  downtown  rally  commemorating  ""Buy  American  Awareness Day"" is going on at this very  minute. A special thank you for generating  the type of support to buy American-made  products being expressed right now goes to  the Steubenville business community,  the  Steubenville Area Board of Realtors, and,  particularly, to Mrs. Wrenn Bethel and her  committee.  Mr. Speaker, the people of this country  want trade reform, and they want it now.  They are looking to this Congress to pro vide it and we had better listen.

1477,835,18,Mr.  CRITICAL ROLE OF LOCAL GOV ERNMENTS  IN NATURAL  RE SOURCE CONSERVATION  JOHNSTON.," Mr.  President,  those of us who serve in Congress deal  with a variety of issues affecting devel opment and preservation of our Na tion's natural resources. As we do so  we must keep in mind the fact that  State and local governments have an  important role to play. In fact,  local  land use  issues  are  frequently  the  most  significant  factors  influencing  the daily lives of our citizens.  A great deal of innovative work on  land and resource management prob lems  is being done by  local govern ments. One such program has  just  been started by the Fairfax County,  VA,  Park  Authority.  Called  the  Making of the Fairfax County Land scape, it is intended to ""Foster greater  citizen awareness of the processes re sponsible  for  landscape  transforma tion and to provide an informed basis  for environmental decisionmaking."" In  effect it is seeking to develop a land  ethic.  The keynote speaker at the Septem ber 21  inauguration for the program  was Mike Harvey, chief counsel for the  minority, of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee. Mike served as  chairman and member of the park au thority in the 1970's and is a national ly  recognized authority on land use  and management policy. His remarks  provide a cogent analysis of the prob lems and opportunities in land use de cisionmaking. Among  other  things,  Mike  points  out:  ""The  frequently  fierce debate over the choice between  development and preservation ignores  the central  issue-our survival does  not depend simply on preservation or  development-it depends on both.""  I commend his speech to all Sena tors and others interested in land use  questions and ask unanimous consent  that it be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  re marks were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  THE MAKING OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY  LANDSCAPE  <Remarks of Mike Harvey)  I am delighted to be here in these familiar  surroundings with so many old friends and  colleagues. I am honored to be asked to say  a few words about the need for the new pro gram you are about to begin. I must confess  that I am sorely tempted to reminisce about  events in the past that I am proud to have  been a part of.  But my assignment today is to help ex plain why the Park Authority's exciting and  innovative  community  program  ""The  Making of the Fairfax County Landscape""  is important, indeed vital, to the future well being of the people of Fairfax County.  The program is intended to ""foster great er citizen awareness of the processes respon sible for  landscape  transformation and to  provide an informed basis for environmental  decision making."" In effect it is seeking to  develop a land ethic.  As Aido Leopold put it, ""We abuse land  because we regard it as a commodity belong ing to us. When we see land as a community  to which we belong, we may begin to use to  with love and respect. There is no other way  for  land to survive the impact of mecha nized man.""  An annoymous 16th Century Englishman  described the problem even more pungently:  ""The law locks up both man and woman  Who steals the goose from off the common  But lets the greater felon loose  Who steals the common from the goose.""  The history of America is, more than that  of most nations,  the history of man con fronted by nature. Our story has been pecu liarly the story of man and the land, man  and the forests, man and the plains, man  and water, man and resources. It has been  the story of a rich and varied natural herit age  shaping American  institutions  and  American values; and it has been equally  the story of Americans seizing, using, squan dering and, belatedly, protecting and devel oping that heritage.  From  the beginning, Americans had  a  lively awareness of the land and the wilder ness. The Jeffersonian faith  in  the  inde pendent  farmer  laid  the  foundation  for  American democracy; and the ever-beckon ing, ever-receding frontier left an indelible  imprint on American society and the Ameri can character.  Yet, at the same time that Americans sa luted the noble bounty of nature, they also  abused and abandoned it. For the first cen tury after independence, we  regarded  the  natural environment as indestructible-and  proceeded vigorously to destroy it. Not till  the late 19th Century did we begin to under stand  that our  resources were not  inex haustible. Only in the 20th century have we  acted  in a systematic way  to defend and  enrich our natural heritage.  The modem American record in conserva tion has been outstanding. It has inspired  comparable efforts all around  the earth.  But it came just in time in our own land.  And the race between education and ero sion, between wisdom and waste, has not  run its course. George Perkins Marsh point ed out a century ago that greed and short sightedness were the natural enemies of a  prudent resources policy. Each generation  ",1985
1478,848,18,Mr.  HARKIN.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly support this bill.  In 1980,  the Congress created  the  Superfund,  recognizing  the need  to  clean up  the many hazardous waste  sites which endanger the health of all  Americans.  Unfortunately,  progress  has been far too slow. Only six priori ty sites have been cleaned up across  the whole country in the last 5 years.  The Environmental Protection Agency  has begun to address only 20 percent  of the 850 sites on the national priori ty list. And, the General Accounting  Office has  estimated  that we may  have as many as 4,000 national priori ty sites.  Iowa has seven toxic waste sites on  the national Superfund  list. Twenty  additional sites are listed under Iowa's  State Superfund law. In addition, it is  estimated  that 270  Iowa dumpsites  contain hazardous or potentially haz ardous materials.  In spite of the size of this problem,  we have seen years of footdragging  and efforts to cut back. Every month  of delay only adds to the cost that will  have to be paid. There is no saving by  delay. Delay  only makes many  of  these sites more dangerous and harder  to  clean up.  It only  increases  the  danger of  contaminating  the water  supply.  This bill calls for spending $7.5 bil lion over 5 years. Estimates for  the  total cost of the cleanup efforts range  from EPA's figure of $23 billion to the  Office  of Technology Assessment's  view that it could take $100 billion to  solve the problem.  We need  to approve a  larger pro gram. I understand that the adminis tration would like to spend less. But  that is the wrong way to go. Studies  have shown that the money can be  well spent. Spending the higher sum  does  not  really  increase  costs.  It  simply has us clean up the sites more  quickly. And, in the long run, it means  that we will spend less.  I am concerned about a key aspect of  the bill-the value added tax charged  to every manufacturer in the country.  I  voted against  the amendment by  Senator ABDNOR which would have ex empted fertilizer and animal feed be cause I believe that if we are going to  have this tax, then we should not be  creating further exemptions. It should  fall on all manufacturing. However, I  want to make it clear that I have res ervations about any value added tax.  I would have preferred to see the Fi nance Committee propose a package  of taxes which looked more to the pol luters.  I do believe that a tax on hazardous  wastes would create a very substantial  incentive for the producers and users  of that waste to find ways to cut down  the amount that needs disposal.  If  With a ""waste end tax,"" we would  see producers of waste adopting all  types of creative mechanisms to recy cle the waste or to avoid its produc tion. And, that would mean fewer ex pensive and dangerous problems in the  future.  I also recognize that there are many  technical and substantive issues which  prevented  the  Finance  Committee  from developing such a proposal  in cluding the desire not to favor one dis posal method over another  through  the tax system.  I  understand  that  the Ways apd  Means Committee plans  to seriously  look at this question along with other  funding mechanisms.  the  other  body passes a  reasonable plan, one  providing for reliable funding, I would  urge that the conferees sympathetical ly  examine  the alternative  funding  mechanism to the value added tax.  ",1985
1479,848,18,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the Superfund reauthoriza tion, H.R. 2005, which we have before  us today. I am proud to vote for a bill  that I believe is a strong and responsi ble answer  to a complex problem.  I  urge my colleagues to join with me in  commending the determined and fruit ful work of the committee in crafting  H.R. 2005.  Hazardous wastes represent a com plex  problem. They  pose  a  direct  threat to our citizens and our environ ment. The improper disposal of these  wastes has had a significant negative  impact on both terrestrial and aquatic  ecosystems. There is little doubt that  without management  of  past  and  present waste, we could be faced with  problems of considerable magnitude.  The extent of our hazardous waste  problem and the consequent cleanup  efforts necessary are now becoming  evident. The number of waste sites on  the national priorities list is increasing  steadily and the Office of Technology  Assessment projects that as many as  10,000 sites may finally be added to  the  list. Cost  estimates of cleanup  have also  increased. GAO and OTA  project that the final cost might total  $40 billion and $100 billion respective ly. And unfortunately, many of those  numbers may have to be adjusted be cause of problems that are just begin ning to reveal themselves. Although I  would have preferred a higher level of  funding for Superfund, I am pleased  that we will be providing almost five  times the level of funding during the  last authorization.  In addition,  I am particularly dis turbed by recent reports on the extent  of ground water contamination since  so many Americans  rely on ground  water as their primary source of drink ing water.  I am hopeful  that EPA,  armed with this strong bill that we are  approving  today, will make  every  effort to deal with the issues that will  undoubtely develop during the life of  this Superfund.  While the problem of how to deal  with our toxic waste dumpsites is sig nificant, I believe that we are proving  that it is not insurmountable. We have  learned much during the first 5 years  of Superfund. This bill enables EPA to  use this experience, advancements in  technology, and increased financial re sources to move toward alleviating this  environmental threat.  Mr. President, I am proud that the  Senate will soon be on record approv ing a strong commitment to the envi ronment and a strong commitment to  the future health and safety of our  Nation. I urge my colleagues to sup port  this worthwhile  legislation by  voting in favor of H.R. 2005.  ",1985
1480,848,18,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to support S. 51,  the Super fund Improvement Act of 1985, and I  commend the chairmen of the Com mittees on Environment and Public  Works, Finance, and the Judiciary, for  their hard work that has brought this  measure before  the Senate for final  passage.  ""Out of sight, out of mind"" is a prov erb which has guided us when it came  to disposing of used household items,  byproducts of manufacturing process es, old packaging, and other residue of  our high-tech American society.  Only recently have we come to rec ognize  the  shortsightedness of our  ways. Knowing what we know now  about the long-term health effects of  many  of  those  products we  threw  away and long since have forgotten,  we have come to recognize our collec tive responsibility. We have contribut ed an enormous amount of dangerous  matter  to our environment without  proper safeguards.  We are now paying the price of our  throwaway habit in Superfund clean up  costs; RCRA disposal  sites and  methodologies; Clean Water and Clean  Air Act discharge permits, ambient air  quality levels, and best available tech nologies; and in health and disability  costs  for persons who have medical  problems today because of our prior  carelessness.  The Superfund bill is part of our col lective response to our past careless ness. The difficulty is that there are  thousands  of  toxic wastesites.  Maryland alone, EPA and the State al ready have  identified 168 sites, only  half of which have, as of yet, been in vestigated and evaluated for toxicity,  at the expense of the State of Mary land.  Here  in Washington, we  recently  read  of  electric  transformers  in  a  Smithsonian Institution Building that  were leaking PCB's. So the problem is  all around us and includes the Federal  Government as well as everyone else.  The Defense Department occupies a  good deal of real estate in Maryland,  including 21 former Nike missile sites.  They are no longer used and the DeIn  ",1985

1493,861,18,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I am  compelled to rise in opposition to the  Treasury, Postal Service and General  Government appropriations bill as re ported by the Appropriations Commit tee because it exceeds the amounts as sumed in the fiscal year 1986 budget  resolution that passed with broad bi partisan support.  Mr. President, this is the first fiscal  year 1986 appropriation bill to be con sidered by the Senate that exceeds the  budget  resolution.  I will  therefore  offer amendments  to bring  the bill  into conformance with the budget res olution so that the Senate can show  the American people that they truly  want to reduce the staggering $200 bil lion Federal deficits.  Mr. President, I would like to point  out that the subcommittee, under the  able chairmanship of Senator ABDNOR,  approved a bill that was largely con sistent with the totals assumed in the  Senate-passed budget resolution, and I  commend the subcommittee members  for their efforts.  However,  the bill  reported by  the  full Appropriations Committee that is  before us  today exceeds  the budget  resolution assumptions, and it must be  addressed.  Mr. President, H.R. 3036 provides  $13.0 billion in budget authority and  $12.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year  1986 for the Department of Treasury,  including the Customs Service and the  Internal Revenue Service, as well as  for the Postal Service, the Executive  Office of the President, and independ ent agencies.  Taking  into account outlays  from  prior-year budget authority, the bill is  $0.1 billion higher in budget authority  and outlays than Senate Budget Com mittee's assumptions for the subcom mittee's allocation  under  the  first  budget resolution. It is necessary  to  score the bill in this fashion in the ab sence of formal 302(b) allocations by  the Appropriations Committee.  I intend to offer an amendment that  would reduce appropriations for non defense  discretionary  appropriated  programs,  by  2-percent  across  the  board to conform the bill to the totals  assumed for the subcommittee under  the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution.  I will oppose any major amendment  adding appropriations to this bill and  urge my colleagues to do the same.

1499,861,18,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  rise today, on behalf of myself, Sena tor CHILES,  and others  to offer  a  simple  amendment  to  the  pending  Treasury-Postal  Service  appropria tions bill.  This amendment would bring the ap propriations bill within the limits as sumed by the first concurrent budget  resolution for 1986 by cutting all dis cretionary,  nondefense  accounts  within it by 2 percent.  In short, this bill exceeds in outlays  the levels assumed by this body when  the Senate voted by a more than 2-to-1  margin for  the budget for  the next  fiscal year just 2 months ago. A simple  2-percent across-the-board cut on all  nonentitlement,  nonmandatory  ac counts in this bill will bring the meas ure within budget. Such a cut not only  will keep this bill, as I see it, consist ent with that resolution but will also  keep faith with the Senate vote.  Senator CHILES and I have agreed to  approach this bill and other bills that  are  significantly over-budget  in  the  same manner. We do so for several  reasons. Let me give mine, and then  my good friend, the distinguished Sen ator from Florida, can give his ration ale.  The Senate voted a budget resolu tion  for  the  upcoming  year,  after  months of effort, that would cut defi cits by $55.5 billion below  the  level  that would otherwise occur. This is a  critical point, because by that vote the  Senate was saying to authorizing com mittees through reconciliation and to  the  appropriations  committees  through  the  normal  appropriations  ",1985

I  am curious as to whether or not the  previous ruling as to the prerogatives  of a committee chairman to remove it  prior to action by the Senate would  extend to the ability of the chairman  to remove that conference report after  final action by the Senate, but before  transmittal to the President for a con stitutional disposal of the question by  the executive branch?

1504,900,18,Mr. GORE.,"  I misspoke myself  in  using the word ""ruling,'' of course. But  the earlier response of the Parliamen tarian, it seems to me, contains within  it logic which would make it possible  for one single Senator to disrupt and  prevent  the majority of  the Senate  from exercising its will, even after the  final vote on a conference report, if it  was within the ability of a single Sena tor  to  just  physically  remove  the  paper which is required for the Presi dent to enact the legislation.

We are told by the Chair,  and rightfully so, that when the chair man of the conferees on the part of  the Senate submits the papers to the  desk, there is no official record made  of that. I do not quarrel with that. I  think the Chair is right. Perhaps there  should be.

1508,900,18,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, the Sen ator from Arkansas is very, very dis turbed  about  this  series of  events  whereby  one  individual Senator,  a  Member of this body, has chosen to  take the conference papers or a piece  of  legislation  in the custody of this  Senate, put it in his pocket, and leave  the Chamber.  Whether he went out the door and  gave it to someone, or took it to Terre  Haute, IN, I do not know that answer.  But, I am deeply concerned that, after  the Senator from Arkansas heard the  questions or  inquiries posed  to  the  Chair, the Chair ultimately stated to  the distinguished minority leader that  ""This has been a common practice.""  Therefore, I would like to propose a  question  to  the Chair.  If this has  become or has been a common practice  in the precedents of the U.S. Senate,  would  the Chair please cite for  the  Senator from Arkansas one Senator or  one  committee  chairman who  has  gone to that desk, taken a conference  report that was in the custody of this  body, and walked out the door with it  to prevent our consideration? Would  the Chair please tell the Senator from  Arkansas when an individual Senator  has done this in the past?  Mr. President,  I  think  the distin guished minority leader has the floor.  If I may, I would like to continue ques tioning later. I understand the distin guished Senator from Massachusetts  has a very important appointment he  would like to meet, and I am glad to  yield at this time if the Senator has a  statement or questions with the un derstanding that I may continue.

1509,900,18,Mr. BYRD., Yes. I understand.  I yield to the Senator from Massa chusetts.  ,1985
1510,900,18,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, first  of all,  I  thank senator BYRD,  our  Democratic leader, for the extraordi nary effort that he has made to bring  this before the Senate in a responsible  way. All of us, on both sides of the  aisle, respect his deep commitment to  the Senate as an institution under the  Constitution of the United States.  So, I applaud the Democratic leader  for his skillful work in bringing us to  where we are  today with respect to  this unusual and distressing situation.  Mr. President, actions speak louder  than words. The majority leader says  he was acting within his rights under  Senate rules when the official papers  re on  the Anti-Apartheid Act were  moved the Senate.  Those are the words we hear. But  the action  that speaks  louder  than  those words is that the missing papers  have now been returned to the desk of  the  Senate. They  reappeared  last  evening, as mysteriously as they disap peared 2 weeks ago today.  The majority leader cites no clear  precedent for his action, and  indeed  there is none. As far as I am aware,  there are only three cases in the entire  history of the Senate that speak to  this issue. All three suggest that the  majority  leader acted  improperly by  participating  in  the  removal of  the  papers.  In 1896,  a  conference  report was  withdrawn by unanimous consent.  In 1906,  a  conference  report was  withdrawn on a voice vote.  Again in 1906, a conference report  was withdrawn  by  the  unilateral  action of one Senator, who declared  before  the Senate, ""I withdraw  the  conference report.""  And that makes all the difference these  withdrawals  were  made  in  public, before the full Senate, and any  Senator could have  challenged  the  action of any other Senator who at tempted to withdraw a report unilater ally.  Frankly, the only fig leaf the majori ty leader is able to find to cover his  raw abuse of power in this situation  comes down to this-the Senate rules  do not specifically say, ""thou shalt not  steal a conference report.""  But the Senate rules are not a legal  code. They contain many gaps, which  leave many opportunities for the rules  to be abused.  But we are a Senate Chamber not a  star chamber. The Senate functions at  all only though a mutual sense of fair  play on both sides of the aisle.  Battles  are  hard  fought  on  the  merits. Able Senators use the rules to  their advantage, but always within the  bounds of the dignity of the Senate.  And the safeguard that all of us has as  a last resort is the ability to challenge  any interpretation of the rules, by ap pealing a ruling of the Chair and abid ing by the verdict of the full Senate.  No Senator,  acting  alone,  should  have the power to prejudice the out come on an issue before the Senate by  a unilateral action of the sort we wit nessed on  the Anti-Apartheid Act 2  weeks ago.  By his actions,  if not yet by his  words, the majority leader has apolo gized to the Senate. The papers are  back where they belong, in the custo dy of the Senate. The cookie is back in  the jar and for that all of us can be  grateful.  But as we all know, timing is every thing. The proponents of  the Anti Apartheid Act have lost precious time  ",1985
1511,913,18,Mr. CHILES.,"  I do not purport to  know the chairman's bill now the way  he does because I am not serving on  the subcommittee now. What I say is  the Senator knows this bill better, and  if  there  is a way  it could be done  better, I would honor that because I  do  not  particularly  like  the  cuts  myself. I know, of course, in the one  instance that the chairman accepted  an amendment from me. We said we  were going  to  transfer some of the  people out of the headquarters of Cus toms and put them out in the field. I  say there are a lot of these agencies in cluding the IRS, Customs, and others.  We can  look at  their headquarters'  staff, and see how many people they  have there as opposed to how many  agencies there are out in the field or  how many people are out actually col lecting taxes.

1512,913,18,Mr. ABDNOR.," I can assure the Sen ator those positions are going  to be  gone. I thought that was a good move.  I supported your amendment. That is  the one way we were able to put more  people in the field. This amendment,  however cuts. They are not going to be  going to the field. Those are the posi tions that will be cut.  ",1985
1513,913,18,Mr. CHILES.," I do not purport to say  that the chairman does not have a  problem, and will not have a problem  with this amendment.  I  think every  subcommittee chairman will have a  problem if we adhere to our resolu tion. That is part of that sort of pain  that the resolution says we are going  to take. But if we pass the budget reso lution, then come back, and do not do  those things, then we make a mockery  out of that process. I really think that  is what we are about here. We are  seeking a binding crosswalk so that we  can actually determine and keep score.  That is our job. That is what we are  supposed to do. That is what the act  says we are supposed to do. I hope the  body will see fit to pass this amend ment. Some people have said budget  authority is supposed to be the only  thing that counts. That is not the way  I read the act. I read the act that it  very much talks about budget outlays.  And I think when each one of us goes  home and talks about the deficit, we  are not talking about budget authority  the amend when we talk about the deficit. We are  talking about how much is spent. That  is outlays. So we had better get our  rhetoric straight  if we are going  to  talk  about  how much we  actually  spend.  Mr. President,  I hope  ment will be adopted.  Mr. BURDICK addressed the Chair.  ",1985
1514,913,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from North Dakota.  ,1985
1515,913,18,Mr. BURDICK.," I rise in opposition  to a 2-percent across-the-board cut in  the Treasury /Postal Service  appro priations bill. Let us look, for example,  specifically at the effect  this would  have on the revenue forgone function.  A 2-percent reduction in the revenue  forgone  appropriation will  seriously  hurt the affected mailers. Even with  the $801 million contained in this bill  for revenue forgone, the mailers who  use  this subsidy do not escape  rate  hikes. Library rate mailings will  in crease 24 percent. Classroom materi als,  veterans  and  religious mailings  would be up 30 percent. Small newspa pers would skyrocket 42 to 56 percent.  The 2-percent cut suggested by Sen ator DoMENICI will result in an esti mated $16 million loss in the revenue  forgone category. Just how much do  we want  to hurt  these mailers  this  year in the name of budget balancing?  Through lower postal rates, the Fed eral Government  acknowledges  the  important contributions made to socie ty by the nonprofit mailing communi ty and assists nonprofits to channel as  much  revenue as possible  into pro gram services rather than operational  expenses. The administration has re peatedly stated their commitment to  this idea.  Since the administration agrees that  reduced postage  rates  for nonprofit  mailers  is a  good  idea,  the way  to  ensure their continuation is through  direct and sufficient appropriations.  Even $801 million is not as much as I  would like to see for the worthy cause;  $16 million less, as proposed by Sena tor DoMENICI  is totally unacceptable;  $801 million  for  revenue  forgone  is  $166 million below the 1985 funding  figure.  It is $160 million below  the  $961 million contained in the House passed Treasury /Postal Service appro priations bill. And  it does not place  this Treasury /Postal Service  appro priations bill over  its budget alloca tion.  For all these reasons, I support the  bill, and oppose  the present amend ment.  ",1985
1516,913,18,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President,  the  bill we are now considering, the Treas ury /Postal  appropriations  for  fiscal  year 1986, is $128 million over the con ference agreement on the first concur rent budget resolution. It is $859 mil lion over the Senate-passed resolution.  Not only is it over the budget resolu tion it exceeds the President's request  even when adding the Senate approwill  priation for postal subsidies to the re quest.  The amendment Senator DOMENICI  and  myself  are  proposing  would  reduce all discretionary spending by 2  percent. This would produce a  total  savings of $139 million. When  the  House of Representatives considered  this bill,  they accepted one amend ment  to  the bill. That amendment  called for a  reduction  in every pro gram,  except  for  law  enforcement,  postal subsidies, and mandatory spend ing. It passed by an overwhelming vote  of 288-133. When  that amendment  was initially offered, it was intended to  bring the bill  in line with the first  budget  resolution as passed by  the  House. Where  they  failed  in  that  effort, we can succeed by adopting this  amendment.  One may argue that the Senate has  already reduced its budget well below  that of the House and in many of the  programs affected by the across-the board reduction. However, of the 34  programs affected by this amendment,  the Senate is over the House level in  26  instances. This indicates that the  typically spend-thrift House has out done us in these 26 programs.  Another argument used is that this  amendment will hurt vital programs.  This is not the case. The BATF, Cus toms Service, and Secret Service, all  experience  increases  over  the  budget  requested amount even with  the 2 percent reduction. Furthermore,  government payment  for annuitants  and employees health benefits, and  payment to the civil service retirement  and disability  fund will  likewise be  exempt from the reduction. While I  feel  that several of  these programs  could use additional cuts, this amend ment as  it  is now structured would  have the best chance of passage.  Finally, Mr. President, the bill does  not even hold to our commitment to  our own budget. For instance, under  the budget resolution, we set a  level  for postal subsides of $700 million, this  bill exceeds that amount by $101 mil lion. If we are going to vote for attrac tive budgets around here, we have got  to stick by them when it comes appro priations time. I urge my colleagues to  accept our amendment which places  us in compliance with the budget reso lution.  ",1985

1526,926,18,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I am  delighted  that we are considering a  bill to authorize appropriations for the  National Science Foundation for fiscal  year 1986. This will be the first au thorization bill for  this agency  that  the Senate has passed since 1980. An  authorization bill for 1986 is possible  because of the statesmanlike conduct  of the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Labor and Human Re sources, Senator HATCH,  the commit tee's ranking member, Senator KENNE DY, and  the other members of that  committee. They have recognized that  the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation has a strong and  legitimate interest in the activities of  the Foundation. I am delighted that  the two committees can work together  to restore the integrity of the authori zation process and, more importantly,  to support the National Science Foun dation.  The National Science Foundation's  budget reflects the importance of sci entific research, even in this year of  fiscal restraint. The Commerce Com mittee reported out on original bill, S.  903, which authorizes the Foundation  at  the  level  recommended  by  the  President. The bill  reported by  the  Labor Committee, which we are con sidering today under a unanimous con sent agreement reached between the  two committees, funds the agency at a  lower,  freeze  level, but  is otherwise  similar to the bill reported by Com merce. It maintains support for  the  program on ethics and values in sci ence and technology, and it includes a  study of research facilities at universi ties, both of which were included in  the Commerce bill.

1527,952,18,Mr.  JOHNSTON.," Mr.  President,  today I am pleased to introduce legis lation to return the ad valorem and  specific duties on necktie imports to  the levels in effect as of January 1,  1981, for a period of 5 years.  Unfortunately, imports of men's and  boys' neckties have accelerated sharp ly in the last 4 years. Since 1980, im ports have grown from  insignificant  levels to 20 percent of the U.S. market.  In 1984 alone, neckwear  imports  in creased by a whopping 64 percent,  double the very high growth in overall  textile and apparel imports over the  same period.  The problem with silk necktie  im ports is particularly grave. In the first  half of 1985, imports of silk neckties  680,  1985  rose by 34  percent over  the  same  period in 1984. Silk is the largest cate gory of imports, and accounted for 52  percent of total U.S. imports of neck ties  in  the  January  to  June  period.  The situation with silk necktie im ports is exacerbated by the fact that  silk and products of silk are not cov ered by  the multifiber arrangement  and,  thus, the industry is unable  to  seek  relief  under  this mechanism,  which purpose  is  to control interna tional  trade  in  textiles and apparel.  Moreover, while S.  the  textile  quota bill, does  include silk and silk  products as textile products for pur poses of quota, the bill excludes Italy  from quota coverage. And Italy is the  source for most U.S.  imports of silk  neckties-some 87 percent in the first  half of 1985. This is precisely why the  necktie industry needs the legislative  relief called for by my bill.  Necktie  imports  are  growing  by  record numbers at a time when duties  on  these  imports are being phased  down as a result of the Tokyo Round  tariff cuts. These cuts range from 20  percent in some categories to over half  the former duty rate in others. While  the average  tariff rate  last year on  clothing imports was in excess of 21  percent, the average duty on necktie  imports was 12 percent. Virtually no  category of neckties has escaped the  pressures of  increased  imports. And  the industry sees the situation worsen ing as the multilateral trade negotia tion [MTN1 phased duty rate reduc tions  continue  to  be  implemented  through 1987.  If necktie imports continue to accel erate at the current rate-stimulated  by declining duty  rates-this  indus try's continued viability will be very  much in question as will be the jobs of  its workers.  This  is  an  industry  composed of  many small establishments, generally  employing fewer than 20 workers. The  work is highly labor intensive and skill  levels are not transferable to jobs out side  of  the  cut-and-sew  industries  where unemployment is already stag gering. This industry has provided a  source of employment for many mi norities;  it has provided entry  level  employment when no other employ ment was to be found.  Because the import situation in this  industry  is  so grave, and conditions  have worsened so rapidly,  legislation  for a temporary adjustment to the ad  valorem and specific duties on necktie  imports is needed. A temporary adjust ment  is well warranted. Without  it,  the consequences for the industry and  its workers will be severe. It is now  time for the Congress to act on this  matter. Consequently, I urge my col leagues to expenditiously approve this  legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of this bill be print ed in the RECORD.

This article  relates the findings of a study released by  the U.S. Forest Service on the civilian con servation corps centers of the Job Corps as  they relate to the centers in my district.  FOREST SERVICE: JOB CORPS WORK OFFSETS  COSTS  The nation's Job Corps Centers have been  assailed Reagan budget makers  in recent  months as a costly program that's not worth  the expense.  But the U.S. Forest Service has come out  with a report that defends two of the cen ters,  including Trapper Creek Job Corps  south of Darby and  the Anaconda  Job  Corps Center near Anaconda.  The agency says that in the past year, the  two Job Corps Centers contributed more  than $2 million worth of work in the Na tional Forests and other public properties.  Mission of the centers is to educate and  train young men  and women. And  the  Forest Service says Job Corps enrollees at  the center  last year put  in 2,265 work  months in accomplishing $2,083,600 of work  on public lands and facilities in the National  Forests.  Work included maintenance and upgrad ing the Center's facilities. Men and women  enrollees did welding, carpentry, concrete  work,  bricklaying,  operated heavy equip ment, and did maintenance work.  The Forest Service says  the Job Corps  centers contributed work only on projects  with inadequate funds for completion. Con tributed  Job Corps work,  under  federal  rules, cannot displace workers or contrac tors and the project, says the Forest Serv ice, must provide ""meaningful training and  work experience.""  A  total of 233 men and women are en rolled at Trapper Creek while 229 men and  women are enrolled at the Anaconda Job  Corps Center.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  GETTING TOUGH ON NERVE  GAS  HON. DANTE B. FASCELL  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
1531,991,18,Mr. F ASCELL.," Mr. Speaker, the editorial  entitled ""How To Get Tough With Nerve  Gas"" in yesterday's New York Times cap tures the sound foreign policy, arms con trol, defense, and budgetary reasons why a  bipartisan majority  in the House has op posed  the production of binary nerve gas  chemical munitions.  In addition, persistent test failures and  technical deficiencies continue  to plague  the binary Bigeye bomb. This fact was reaf firmed just last week in  the General Ac counting Office  report  to Congress  in  which GAO again recommended that Con gress should not fund  the binary produc tion program in fiscal year 1986. This GAO  report concludes  that the binary funding  request is premature because ""the Bigeye  bomb has not met the established minimum  chemical requirement for chemical purity  and numerous critical technical issues are  unresolved.""  This is sound counsel and advice which I  hope will be affirmed as we appropriate de fense levels in fiscal year 1986.  The New York Times editorial follows:  [From the New York Times, Sept. 25, 19851  How TO GET TouGH WITH NERVE GAs  Nerve gas is a hideous weapon, but as long  as Soviet troops are equipped with chemical  munitions,  American  troops  cannot  denied an effective response. That's why the  Defense Department's plan to build a new  generation  of  chemical  arms-so-called  ""binary"" weapons-is so dismaying. Never  mind their vast extra cost, their stabilizing  effect on NATO or the initiation of a new  race in chemical arms; the new binary weap ons will be less effective.  Every new weapon has defects, often seri ous, which field tests may remedy. Binary  weapons surely have their share, but these  as-yet-unknown flaws remain undetected be cause Congress has restricted field tests. No  soldier should be asked to fight with untest ed weapons. And the Bigeye bomb, one of  the  proposed  binary weapons,  is  still  plagued with manifest design flaws.  Advocates  say binary weapons will be  safer to handle, since the nerve gas is not  generated until two chemicals are mixed, in  flight, in the delivery shell. Maybe, but the  present shells and bombs have a long and  excellent safety record, without a single se rious accident. Why fix a non-problem? Ad  vacates of binaries contend  the present  stockpile has sprung leaks. Yes,  there are  minute leaks-in 0.0006 percent of artillery  shells. All other stockpiled shells are usable.  The only practical reason for moving to  binary weapons would be evidence that the  present  stockpile might  later deteriomte  beyond use. That's an answerable technical  question. A blue-ribbon panel appointed by  the Department of Defense  is conducting  aging  tests. Why  rush  to  start making  binary weapons, costing $2.3 billion over five  years, when these tests may well show the  present stockpile has a long life ahead?  What truly needs fixing is not chemical  offense but defense. The Pentagon has so  be  25215  far failed to institute advice by the Defense  Science Board to remedy gaps in manpower,  training and equipment. The Army has no  medical products  in the field  for care of  chemical casualties, no proper decontamin ants of equipment and no antidote against  the standard Soviet nerve gas. Commanders  ofter subvert training requirements, such as  showing troops how to eat in a contaminat ed environment, according to the General  Accounting Office.  Maintaining deficient chemical defenses,  and  replacing  effective  weapons  with  unproven ones, is hardly the best way of de terring the Soviet Union from first use of  chemical weapons.  For the last three years the House has re fused to allow production of binary weap ons. This year, under the shadow of the hi jacked Americans  taken hostage  in Leba non, it mistakenly changed position, but re quired  that production  not begin  until  NATO  requests  that binary weapons be  stored in Europe. Since several NATO coun tries are highly unlikely to allow present  stockpiles to be replaced with binaries, the  condition is highly desirable insurance. Yet  it was surrendered in conference with the  Senate.  The House has a chance  to  redress  its  error next month as it writes the Pentagon's  appropriations bill. Binary weapons are a  bad buy, and there's no good reason for the  House to abandon its longstanding distrust  of them.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM R.  CLARK  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
1532,991,18,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  share with my  distinguished  colleagues  some of my thoughts on one of my out standing constituents from Williamstown,  MA. It is always a pleasure for me to have  an opportunity to honor a devoted and pro fessional man such as Dr. William R. Clark  who  is retiring from the teaching profes sion after over 36 years of strong commit ment  to  the  education of children. Dr.  Clark has dedicated his life to the educa tion of the young, and Williamstown has  indeed been most fortunate to have h~ Dr.  Clark teach its children since 1955 when he  came to Massachusetts from Virgina.  We have all had in our past teachers who  have inspired and motivated us to excel in  various ways, whether  it is  in  the class room or on the sport's field. Dr. Clark is  one of those  teachers who has been  the  spark  for so many of his  students. His  flame will continue  to bum brightly for  them for many years  to come providing  warmth, inspiration, and imagination.  Our childreli have learned not only im portant historical  lessons and  facts  from  this dedicated professional, but they have  observed firsthand Dr. Clark's high moral  character and integrity. His students have  always come first and he has worked dili gently to creatively challenge and channel  this vast and valuable resource. His tireless  work has touched everyone in some way in  ",1985
1533,1017,18,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, the  admission this week by the French Govern ment of direct responsibility for the attack  on the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow War rior, has raised profound moral questions  as well underscored important lessons for  all democratic systems of governance.  For 14 years, Greenpeace has striven to  prevent nuclear  testing and save endan gered sea animals. It is a profound irony  that an organization dedicated  to peace  and nonviolence should fall victim to such  a  senseless act of state-sponsored  terror ism.  From an American perspective, it is in structive to search out the important les sons of this  tragedy. There appear to be  several of note.  First, a great power can make a great  mistake,  this one bordering on  the silly.  For France to seek recourse  in sabotage  against an idealistic few could not demon strate more  graphically  the  increasing  tendency of peoples-and governments-to  vent  their disagreements and accomplish  their objectives  through violence against  innocents.  Second, even if seemingly justified from  a national  interest perspective, acts  that  violate international law and international  norms of behavior are generally counter productive. Support for Greenpeace as well  as senseless rifts between democratic coun tries like New Zealand and France can only  grow after such egregious, premeditated vi olence.  Third, seldom can a democratic society  engage in covert violence without eventual ly being forced to accept responsibility. In telligence services must understand that de spite great safeguards,  leaks often occur  and, as in this instance, a government in  power has been forced to recant, to its em barrassment and jeopardy.  Fourth,  few  governments have  armies  that can stand up to the awesome military  capabilities of the nuclear powers. But in  the area of terrorism, they can compete on  equal, and in some cases stronger, footing  because acts of a terrorist nature are usual ly less acceptable in democratic as opposed  to  authoritarian  societies.  Accordingly,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  democratic governments have a vested in terest in avoiding terrorism and conform ing foreign policy as pristinely as possible  to international law. Adherence to the rule  of law should be the touchstone that distin guishes democracy from politically repres sive systems of the left and the right. Au thoritarian societies should never be given  the excuse of rationalizing terror~sm as a  tit-for-tat response to the illegal acts of de mocracies.  Europeans  sometimes assume  that  the  venerable histories of their societies pro vide them a greater grasp of the subtleties  of international affairs and diplomacy. The  Greenpeace  episode belies  such  assump tions.  But  in  the case, we would do well  to  assess the mistakes of the French and ask  whether there are lessons for our own for eign policy. Does it, for instance, advance  international law to deny the jurisdiction  of the World Court over our poliGtes  in  Central America? Do we  retard or tnvite  greater  terrorism by aiding and abetting  counterrevolutionary forces  in Nicaragua?  Can we insulate our interventionist policy  in Lebanon from reactions against Ameri cans and governmental facilities, here and  abroad?  In plotting the sinking of the Rainbow  Warrior, the French appear to have overre acted to the Greenpeace movement. In ini tially denying public accountability  they  appear to have underestimated the demand  for truth in a democracy.  An American might ask whether Paris  has become anesthetized to the subtleties of  right and wrong in national security policy.  A Frenchman might respond that the anes thesia had been administered  in powerful  doses on this side of the Atlantic.  THE YEAR OF THANKSGIVING  HON. TONY P.

The National Committee of the Year of  Thanksgiving has advised us of their deci sion to focus upon 1987 as  the ""Year of  Thanksgiving."" The year 1987 will be espe cially appropriate since it marks both the  bicentennial of  the Constitution of  the  United States and  the convening of  the  1 OOth Congress. In addition,  the selection  of the year 1987 will provide extra time for  the preparation of ceremonies and activi ties to observe the ""Year of Thanksgiving.""  Therefore, we are introducing a new res olution to reflect this change. The resolu tion we  are  introducing  is  identical  to  House Joint Resolution 398, except that the  ""Year of Thanksgiving"" has been changed  from 1986 to 1987.  25241  We urge our colleagues to join with us as  cosponsors of the ""Year of Thanksgiving""  resolution. The text of the resolution fol lows:  H.J. REs. 398  To designate 1987 as the ""Year of  Thanksgiving"".  Whereas, since the days of the early set tlers, it has been a tradition of the Ameri can people to celebrate a season of thanks giving;  Whereas many of our great national lead ers,  including President Washington and  President Lincoln,  recognized  the  impor tance of setting aside a time of thanksgiving  by Presidential proclamation, as in procla mations  which  established  the  fourth  Thursday  in November  as Thanksgiving  Day;  Whereas, in 1941, Thanksgiving Day was  established as a permanent national holi day; and  Whereas, in 1987, the people of the United  States will celebrate the Bicentennial of the  Constitution of the United States and the  convening of  the  lOOth Congress: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That 1987 is desig nated as the ""Year of Thanksgiving"", and  the President is authorized and requested to  issue a proclamation calling upon the Gov ernors of the several States, the chief offi cials of local governments, and the people of  the United States to observe such year with  appropriate ceremonies and activities.  LEV ELBERT'S 37th BIRTHDAY  HON. MIKE LOWRY  OF WASHINGTON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
1535,1017,18,Mr. LOWRY of Washington.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to take this opportunity to  extend my best wishes  to Lev Elbert of  Ki'ev on the occasion of his 37th birthday  on September 30. Lev, his wife Inna, and  their  son Carmi  are  among  the many  Soviet Jews who  inspire us all with  the  courage, dignity, and determination  that  characterize their struggle to win the rights  to worship freely and to emigrate.  The past few years have been difficult  ones for the Elberts. In 1983, Lev was sen tenced to imprisonment in a labor camp for  refusing to report for reserve military duty.  His refusal stemmed from his concern that  the authorities would claim that he was ex posed to military secrets during the addi tional military service and use this excuse  to permanently deny him permission  to  emigrate. Inna's health has suffered from a  hunger strike  that she began  to protest  phony drug charges against Lev, which  were eventually dropped. Their son Carmi  was injured in anti-Semitic attacks at his  school.  In May of this year, Lev's most  recent application for permission  to emi grate was turned down. Lev's brother has  received  anti-Semitic hate mail. But  the  family has shown immense inner strengths  throughout their ordeal.  I know that our continuing expressions  of support and concern are a great help. I  ",1985
1536,1030,18,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, on  Tuesday, September 24  the House debated  the Arts, Humanities and Museums Amend ments of 1985, which extends the authori zation of the National Endowment for the  Arts, the National Endowment for the Hu manities,  and  the  Institute of Museum  Services through fiscal year 1989. I wanted  to compliment my colleague, Congressman  PAT WILLIAMS, for this legislation which he  crafted. It reinforces the Federal mission of  fostering a climate of access to excellence  in the visual and performing arts as well as  fostering scholarship and the preservation  of our museum collections across the coun try. I am proud to cosponsor this legisla tion which also underscores  the need  to  assure  that  all Americans  benefit  from  these Federal programs,  including  those  who have traditionally been overlooked be cause they fall outside the mainstream of  our culture or beyond the reach of our cul tural centers.  The bill addresses  the underrepresented  groups in several ways: It encourages sup port of projects that reach or reflect the  culture of a minority, inner city or rural  community; it encourages the selection of  more individuals from traditionally under represented  groups  for  the  artists  and  scholars grant assistance; and  it requires  that the State planning meetings be open to  the public and that the State plan set goals  for serving a broad range of groups. These  changes will encourage the endowments to  respond  to the changing demographics of  our population by encouraging more rural  arts development and access to the arts and  humanities for emerging groups and insti tutions.  I also wanted to comment on another im portant provision of H.R. 3248 which  re quires the Secretary of Labor to prescribe  regulations so  that  the National Endow ment for the Humanities will pay profes sional performers and supporting profes sional personnel employed in their projects  at least the prevailing local wage. The 1976  reauthorization  amendments  included  a  provision  to assure that the National En dowment for  the Humanities would con form  their hiring practices with  those of  the National Endowment for  the Arts by  requiring that workers be paid the prevail ing local wage.  In the 9 years  that have  lapsed, the Secretary of Labor has failed to  promulgate regulations necessary to carry  out the intent of this law. This failure by  the National Endowment for the Human ities to adhere to Davis-Bacon provisions is  a  rare departure  from Federal  practice  which guards  against  setting up  unfair  labor projects.  I believe  the  language  in  H.R. 3248  is vital  to  retain a  consistent  Federal policy with respect to hiring prac tices.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Finally,  I would  like  to note  that  this  year marks the 20th anniversary of the Na tional Endowment for the Arts and the Na tional Endowment for the Humanities. Ac cording to a recent poll by Lou Harris, an  overwhelming 92  percent of those  inter viewed are convinced that the arts are im portant to the quality of life and important  to the economy of their community. H.R.  3248 reaftlrms the Federal role in assuring  a continued flourishing of the arts and hu manities in our country.  ROBERT  LAMBERT  AWARDED  ""BEST  INFORMATION SECURI TY  PROGRAMMER""  BY  U.S.  AIR FORCE  HON.THOMASJ.DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. Mr. Speak er, I would like to take this opportunity to  offer my congratulations to T. Sgt. Robert  Lambert of the U.S. Air Force. Technical  Sergeant Lambert has been singled out as  the best information security programmer  in the Air Force. This award not only dis tinguishes Technical Sergeant Lambert's 10  years of exemplary service to his country,  but is proof positive  that clever, capable  and dedicated people continue to be our  most valuable defense asset.  Technical Sergeant Lambert has played a  vital role in assuring the strength, efficien cy, and security of our Armed Forces. We  are all thankful to him, and owe him, as  well as all Americans, our continued dedi cation to ensuring the strength, reliability,  and sensibility of our Nation's defenses. To  this end, I will continue to urge my col leagues  to support  those measures which  provide our service people with the benefits  they not only need, but deserve.  I know how proud Robert's family and  friends are of his accomplishments. I share  in that pride, and once again offer my sin cere thanks for a job well done.  RECOGNIZING ANNE AND JOHN  WANER ON THEIR 50TH WED DING ANNIVERSARY  HON. WILLIAM 0. LIPINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
1537,1030,18,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  before my colleagues to recognize a signifi cant event achieved by two residents of the  Fifth Congressional District  of  Illinois,  which I am privileged to represent. On Sep tember 28, 1985, Anne and John Waner will  celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.  A successful entrepreneur, John Waner's  skills in mortgage lending, real estate ap praisal, and the construction field prompt ed him to serve in an advisory capacity to  four U.S. Presidents. Mr. Waner has direct ed such governmental agencies as the Fed eral Housing Administration and  the DeSeptember 26, 1985  partment of Housing and Urban Develop ment. Anne and John Waner together own  and run the Dancing Wheel Skating Rink,  a family entertainment center for skating  enthusiasts on the southwest side of Chica go. The Waners were both born in Chicago  and have resided there all their lives. They  were married at St. Camillus Church on the  southwest side of Chicago.  Their 50 years  together  is certainly a  worthy  accomplishment.  It has provided  them with  four  children:  Joan,  James,  Arthur,  and  Linda;  six  grandchildren:  James Jr., Jonlyn, Geri, Janine, Karen, and  Andrew; and one great-granddaughter, Ni chole.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to  salute this fine couple and I join the resi dents of the Fifth Congressional District in  sending congratulations to Anne and John  Waner on this joyous occasion.  H.R. 3371  HON. DEAN A. GALLO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
1538,1030,18,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, recently, I in troduced  a  bill, H.R.  3371,  designed  to  reduce the defaults in the Guaranteed Stu dent Loan  Program  and  the National  Direct Student Loan Program.  Each year, Congress provides an increas ing amount of money to guarantee loans  made to students by banks and other au thorized lenders. In addition to subsidizing  the interest rates on these loans, the Feder al Government also pays lenders in cases of  student defaults. The  two  largest student  aid programs are the Guaranteed Student  Loan Program and the National Direct Stu dent Loan Program which required Federal  obligations of $3.1 billion and $217 million  in fiscal year 1984, respectively.  The most recent figures show  that de faults on these student loans have reached  an alarming total of $1.1 billion, a figure  that has doubled  in the last 4 years. The  Secretary of Education has further indicat ed that total defaults could go as high as $3  billion in the near future, with the national  default rate reaching 10.7 percent last year  and projected  to go  to 11.7 percent  this  year.  This situation has developed because of  the common misconception  that no one  loses if a student defaults. In fact, you and  I,  the taxpayers, lose. In addition, the in creasing number of students who rely on  these loans to finance their education are  penalized since more of the Federal contri bution to financial aid is required to cover  loan defaults.  To  remedy  this  situation,  the Federal  Government, as well as State governments,  has taken action to increase collections on  student  loans,  including  garnishing  the  wages of Government employees who have  outstanding  loans  and withholding  tax  refund checks.  Further actions, however, are necessary  to prevent loans from going into default in  ",1985

1542,1043,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speak er.  reserving  the  right  to object,  I  would ask the gentleman from Ohio to  explain what is the nature of this re quest, which is somewhat unusual on a  day when we have  little  legislative  business.  ",1985
1543,1043,18,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Apparently, Mr.  Speaker, if the gentleman will yield so  I may respond to the question, it is to  give the Ways and Means Committee  some time to get their report and their  act together on the tobacco bill that is  going to be before us.  ",1985
1544,1043,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speak er,  further  reserving  the  right  to  object. I see the chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee, the gentleman  from Illinois, present in the Chamber,  and I would be happy to yield to him  for an explanation of what bills he in tends  to bring to  the floor without  notice.  ",1985
1545,1043,18,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," If the gen tleman from Wisconsin will yield, as  the gentleman is aware. there is going  to be considered, I hope by unanimous  consent,  the Emergency Extension  Act, which includes the extension of  the cigarette tax, the borrowing au thority on railroad retirement unem ployment insurance, the trade adjust ment  assistance  authority,  and  the  Medicare hospital and physician reim bursement rule.  These are all measures that are ex piring tonight. The bill was approved  by unanimous vote of the members of  the Ways and Means Committee. It is  my hope to consider this measure ex tending the present law for 45 days.  And the reason I have requested the  recess is, the minority has not yet ar rived, and I was under the impression  that we would meet in the Committee  on Ways and Means and then come  over to deliberate on this. However, I  understand that time to discuss  this  issue with the committee has elapsed.  ",1985
1546,1043,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER., Further re serving the right to object. is it the in tention of the majority to bring up the  bill extending the present dairy pro gram as well?  ,1985

1548,1043,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Further re serving the right to object. as the gen tleman from Ohio knows, I would be  very interested in that as well. I think  with the adjustment of the schedule  that seems to be developing here on  as  the floor, the Members should have as  much notice as possible on precisely  what is to be brought up. I have no ob jection to the gentleman from lllinois  bringing the Ways and Means bill up,  but I am wondering if this is going to  be a never-ending panoply of bills that  have to be passed because some pro gram expires at midnight tonight.  I would yield to the gentleman from  Ohio if he could shed some further  light on this subject.  ",1985
1549,1043,18,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker. on  these days, on Monday, quite often  there are a lot of things going on in  various committees. and we had ex pected to be ready to go after these  two rules had come up. This is an un usual circumstance when in fact we  are waiting for Members to come to  the floor and reports to be done and  things to be considered. It is my un derstanding that with this recess we  will be able to get things in order and  come back to the floor and be more or ganized than what we appear to be  right now.  ",1985
1550,1043,18,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Further re serving the right to object, I hesitate  giving the majority party unanimous  consent for a complete blank check on  what to bring up. And unless the gen tleman from Ohio, who propounded  the unanimous consent request,  is a  little bit more specific and limits what  the further program is going to be, I  will be constrained to object.  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio,  if he can give the body some kind of  specific list of what is being brought  up which will not be exceeded.  ",1985
1551,1043,18,Mr. HALL of Ohio.," If I may further  respond to the gentleman. it is my un derstanding  that  there will only be  two things considered today. It is this  extension that is presently before us.  the gentleman from  illinois  RosTENKowsKil mentioned, and  the  farm extension. Those are  the only  two matters.  ",1985

1557,1082,18,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President,  today I  am  introducing  the Niobrara Scenic  River Designation Act.  This legislation represents the col lective effort of landowners along the  Niobrara River  in Nebraska-one of  the most beautiful places in this great  country of ours. It would designate a  76-mile stretch of this river as a na tional scenic river and preserve  this  area essentially as it is today for gen erations to come.  Five years ago, farm and ranch land owners  along  this  stretch of  river  began to organize in order to formu late  the proposal  I  am  introducing  today. In the spring of this year, a  group of these landowners met with  me in Lincoln, NB, and I agreed to  sponsor their proposal. I am proud to  be a part of such a worthwhile under taking.  The purpose of scenic designation is  to preserve the free-flowing condition  of this portion of the Niobrara River  and the beauty of the associated land scape for the benefit and enjoyment of  future generations. Scenic rivers are  free of impoundments, with shorelines  and watersheds still mostly undevel oped, but  still  accessible by  roads.  Scenic designation  is  less  restrictve  than  a wild  river  designation  and  would retain the character of the area  in basically its present condition. The  Interior Department would be allowed  to purchase  scenic  easements  from  landowners  along  the  shoreline  to  ensure that the beauty of this area is  preserved.  At the same time, Mr. President, this  legislation would ensure that an ap propriate balance be maintained be tween the goals of preservation and  development. For decades, Nebraska  farmers and ranchers have helped to  feed America and the world. Agricul ture is our State's lifeblood and most  important industry. Yet, American ag riculture  and  the  rural  lifestyle  is  threatened today by circumstances fa miliar to us all.  This  legislation  accomplishes  this  needed balance by specifically provid ing that it will not hinder the innova tive ground water  recharge plan  to  provide irrigation water to those who  need it in north-central Nebraska. Ear lier this year, I introduced legislation  In  here  in the U.S. Senate authorizing  this  plan  as  a  substitute  for  the  Norden Dam which was voted down by  the House of Representatives in 1982.  While most of the components of this  irrigation  project would  be  down stream from and unaffected by  this  76-mile portion of the Niobrara to be  designated as scenic,  the Springview  component of the project falls within  this area. Therefore, this bill provides  specific authority for that portion of  the project  to be built within  the  scenic area.  Mr. President, there are many other  provisions of this legislation where de viations  from  the  basic Wild  and  Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 have been  made.  fact,  the Niobrara Scenic  River Designation Act contains several  significant features which are tailored  specifically to the needs and desires of  the landowners and others in the area.  For example, the bill contains a Nio brara Scenic River Advisory Council  composed of farm and ranch landown ers, State, and local government repre sentatives and others who will play an  important role in developing and re viewing  the  Interior Department's  management plan for the area. This  will ensure local input and review of  the management plan which will im plement scenic river designation.  This bill specifically  instructs  the  Secretary of the Interior that exising  land use practices-including  estab lished agricultural and livestock oper ations, timber management practices,  and  private  campgrounds-will  be  compatible with  scenic  designation.  Additionally, provision is made for re placement and additional  structures  and the normal activities of existing  irrigation projects will not be affected.  The use and allocation of water rights  by the State of Nebraska will also not  be affected.  The Interior Department may also  share in the expenses of conservation  and  streambank  erosion  control  as  well  as  local  government  functions  such as litter control and law enforce ment. It is the intention of the land owners along the Niobrara that this be  a cooperative venture-with as  little  involvement as possible-with the Fed eral Government.  Mr. President, this legislation repre sents a tradeoff which those owning a  large majority of the land on the Nio brara are willing to make. In effect,  they are making a deal with the Fed eral Government. Landowners are will ing to accept certain restrictions on de velopment of their land in return for a  longstanding  commitment  from  the  Government not to disturb the river  valley's basic  pastoral  beauty  and  quality which they have preserved so  well for so long.  While the bill provides for the pur chase of scenic easements from land owners, private land would still remain  ",1985

A consecration takes place only once in the  history of a church; 37 years ago, the Greek  Orthodox community in Dayton construct ed a church building. However, it has never  been consecrated, and thus remains incom plete.  On Sunday, October 6, the church will be  consecrated during a ceremony officiated  by  His  Eminence Archbishop  Iakovos,  leader of 4 million Greek Orthodox Chris tians in North and South America, and re cipient of our Nation's highest  civilian  award, the Medal of Honor.  Also participating will be His Excellency  Bishop Timotheos of Detroit, leader of the  diocese  to which  the Dayton church be longs,  and Father Stratton Dorozenski,  priest of the Dayton parish.  Other participants will be Fathers Jerry  Tasikas, Philemon Payiatis, and George  Hiotis, past priests of the community; and  Fathers Nick Tsaknides and Dean Gigicos,  priests who are from and were ordained in  Dayton.  I join the 400 families who are members  of the Greek Orthodox Church of Dayton,  special guests, and the entire Dayton com munity in congratulations on this very spe cial occasion.  I offer my deepest hope that the church  building continue as a house of worship,  fulfillment, and peace for many years to  come.

SUPERFUND-THE MOST IMPOR TANT ENVIRONMENTAL  ISSUE  FACING THIS CONGRESS  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 30, 1985  ",1985
1570,1108,18,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, we  in  the  Congress will soon be facing one of the  most important decisions before us this ses sion-the decision about the continuation  of the Superfund Program. Toxic wastes  spewn  from our Nation's  industries are  being dumped haphazardly  in dangerous  sites all across our Nation. The crisis  is  growing daily.  My own congressional district is no ex ception. Recent  revelations of hazardous  waste sites on and around the San Francis co Peninsula have emphasized the univer sality of this problem. In a recent survey,  which I conducted to assess the views of  my constituents in the 11th Congressional  District of California, 82 percent indicated  that they favored an  increase  in Federal  Government funding for programs to clean  up hazardous toxic waste dumps. There is a  strong concern and a desire for action to  remedy this growing crisis.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the  attention of my colleagues in Congress a  recent article by Douglas P. Wheeler, exec utive director of the Sierra Club, which ap peared in Sierra, the national publication  of the Sierra Club. This article is one of the  best analyses of the current status of this  issue.  The text of the article follows:  Tm: VOTE OF THE YEAR  <By Douglas P. Wheeler>  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 30, 1985  ",1985
1571,1108,18,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the  lOOth  anniversary  celebration  of Saint  Mary, Refuge of Sinners Catholic Church  in Cambridge, MD.  As we  in Maryland commemorate Saint  Mary, Refuge of Sinners Church's untiring  and  unwavering  commitment  to  faith  during the past century, I believe it is alto gether fitting that we give  thanks to the  many church members who, over the gen erations, have brought comfort and light to  the people of Cambridge. On momentous  occasions such as this, we not only share  remembrances of a rich and vibrant past,  <The upcoming Superfund vote will be the  most important pollution decision this Con gress makes. Will  the  law serve polluters  better than the public?>  The American people are deeply troubled  by the dangers of toxic wastes. According to  a recent poll, 93 percent of the population is  seriously concerned. The highly hazardous  effluvia of our nation's industries, dumped  indiscriminately  across  landscapes urban,  suburban, and rural, pose a deadly threat to  individuals, and they know it.  But in the crowded chamber of the House  Energy and Commerce Committee on June  20, there was no evidence of the widespread  public demand to clean up toxic dumps. In stead it was business as all-too-usual, as the  Subcommittee on Commerce, Transporta tion and Tourism voted on  legislation  to  extend the five-year-old federal Superfund  September 30, 1985  program. Encouraged by chemical and oil  industry lobbyists, the subcommittee struck  down a strong Superfund bill by a vote of 13  to 5. After repudiating its own chair's draft  bill, the subcommittee substituted a diluted  measure crafted by Reps. John Dingell <D Mich.> and James Broyhill <R-N.C.>. respec tively the chair and ranking Republican on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Environmentalists were  appalled.  The  Dingell-Broyhill  bill,  said  subcommittee  chair James Florio <D-N.J.), would perpet uate the agonizingly slow pace of cleanup  the nation has endured for  the  last five  years.  ""Power politics, pure and simple,""  was Sierra Club lobbyist Blake Early's as sessment. ""Polluters couldn't have written a  better bill for themselves.""  In fact, the vote marked a stunning rever sal. Just ten months earlier, in August of a  presidential election year, the full House of  Representatives  had  adopted  a  much  stronger Superfund bill by a lopsided 323-to33 margin. Now the subcommittee had re jected a bill modeled on that earlier version  and substituted a much weaker bill in its  place.  Members of the subcommittee who voted  for the Dingell-Broyhill bill had various ex planations and excuses for adopting a bill so  compatible with the desires of the chemical  industry. Several suggested they had voted  for it because nothing stronger could possi bly pass this timorous subcommittee-a pre diction made certain by  their defections.  Several talked hopefully about strengthen ing the bill later, when the full committee  took up the issue, a prospect Rep. Gerry Si korski <D-Minn.> likened to ""putting wings  on a sow.""  Through July the full Energy and Com merce Committee labored over the Dingell Broyhill bill, but the results were consist ently the same. Amendments to strengthen  the bill were defeated day after day. Ulti mately the committee approved the bill in  about the same form they had received it all sow and no wings. As a result, the entire  House will be faced in September with the  most important pollution and public health  vote of the year:  It will either ratify or  reject the Dingell-Broyhill Superfund.  The nation's toxic waste cleanup program  was in trouble even before this legislative  setback. Created five years ago to finance  emergency cleanup of abandoned hazardous  waste dumps, the program has only begun  to tackle the effort. Hundreds of sites iden tified  by  the Environmental  Protection  Agency have yet to be studied,  let alone  cleaned up. Hundreds more are being added  to the backlog each year. There are now  more sites classified as extr<!mely dangerous  than when the law was first enacted in Sep tember 1980.  Cleaning up toxic waste dumps is extreme ly difficult. Many of the sites contain dozens  of  chemically  diverse,  highly  toxic  sub stances  in a morass of abandoned mine  shafts,  underground  springs, or  swamps.  Cleanup  is also expensive. But  the EPA  needs motivation and support as much as it  needs money and know-how. The agency's  current administrator, Lee Thomas,  lacks  the political base to serve as advocate for an  effective program.  Congress has the opportunity to rectify  these problems. It can mandate that the  EPA proceed on an aggressive schedule to  study  the most dangerous  sites and get  them  cleaned up  promptly,  and  ensure  enough funding to do so. It can empower  citizens whose health is theatened by aban doned dumps to sue  those responsible. It  ",1985

ACHIEVEMENTS OF BLACK MEM BERS  OF  THE  ARMY  AIR  CORPS IN WORLD WAR II  ",1985
1574,1121,18,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, it  is a pleasure for me to pay tribute to  the  black  airmen  who  heroically  served our Nation  in  the European  theater in World War II. For the bene fit of my distinguished colleagues and  our country, I would like to mention  some of their achievements.  51-059 0-86-36 (Pt. 18)  THE 99TH PURSUIT SQUADRON  Mr. President, records show that the  pilots  in  the all-black 99th Pursuit  Squadron proved themselves in a posi tive way in the European theater in  World War II. These brave pilots of  the 99th Squadron were  trained at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.  The first combat assignment of the  99th Squadron came on June 2, 1943.  The operation called for the squadron  to be wingmen on a strafing mission  against the heavily fortified island of  Pantelleria, near Italy. Following sev eral days of strafing and bombing, the  enemy  forces  of  the  island  surren dered on June 11, 1943.  On July 2, 1943, six 99th Pursuit  Squadron pilots were assigned the role  of escorting 16 B-25 bombers, whose  mission was to bomb the Castelvetrano  Airfield on the island of Sicily. Just  after  the bombs were dropped,  two  enemy aircraft attempted  to attack  the bombers, but the 99th pilots inter cepted them. One of the enemy air craft was shot down, and  the other  turned and faded  into  the distance.  Not a single bomber was lost on this  mission.  Mr. President, until the end of the  war in Europe in May 1945, the 99th  Pursuit Squadron protected bombers  on flights all over the Continent of  Europe,  specifically  including  the  countries of Greece, Hungary, Roma nia, Austria, Poland, Italy, and Germa ny. Part of  the Tuskegee  airmen's  pride was the fact that they did not  lose  any  bombers  on  their  escort  flights.  For  the  record, Mr. President,  I  would like to list some of the sacrifices  and heroic achievements in combat of  black airmen in Europe in World War  II:  COMBAT RECORD OF BLACK AIRMEN  ENEMY PROPERTY DESTROYED  111 aircraft <in the air), 150 aircraft <on  the ground), 16 barges and boats, 58 box  cars and other rolling stock, 57 locomotives,  1 radar installation, 2 oil and ammunition  dumps.  ACTION IN FLIGHT  1,578 grand total of missions flown, 15,533  grand total of sorties flown, 992 pilots grad uated at Tuskegee, 450 pilots sent overseas,  66 killed in action.  AWARDS  1 Legion of Merit <military award con ferred by the President), 1 Silver Star <by  the United States for gallantry in action), 2  soldier medals <by U.S.-decoration for brav ery-risk of life), 8 Purple Hearts <by U.S. wounded  in  action),  150  Distinguished  Flying Crosses (by U.S. for heroism or ex ceptional  service  in  aerial  combat>.  14  Bronze Stars <by U.S. for valor, decoration  for courage), 740 air medals and clusters (by  U.S.  for meritorious  achievement while  flying).  A SOUTH CAROLINIAN IN BLACK HISTORY  South Carolina is proud that one of  its natives  taught and  trained  the  pilots of the 99th Squadron at Tuske gee Institute. He is Mr. Ernest Henderson, Sr., a native of Laurens County,  SC. At the age of 25, Mr. Henderson  became a proficient civilian pilot and  flight  instructor  in  the Army Air  Corps. He had the distinct privilege of  being a  flying mate of the late and  famous Gen. Daniel ""Chappie"" James,  Jr .. at Tuskegee Institute, AL,  in the  1940's. They flew  the same airplanes  from  the same airport and had  the  same  flight  instructors  during  the  early years of their careers in aviation.  Flight  Instructors Henderson  and  James both  completed  the Civilian  Pilot Training Program under Chief  Charles A. Anderson at Tuskegee In stitute, and both were employed as  flight  instructors  in  the Army Air  Corps Aviation Cadet Program.  In  1943, when Daniel ""Chappie"" James,  Jr., entered the program as a cadet,  Ernest Henderson was retained at the  flying school at Tuskegee as a flight  instructor,  although  he wanted  to  enter the Cadet Program. He soon at tained the position of assistant squad ron commander, a position in which  he gave flight tests and flight exami nations to cadets seeking graduation.  Mr. Henderson trained on the average  of 20 cadets a year who entered aerial  combat in the aforementioned famous,  all-black,  99th  Pursuit  Squadron  which made history in the European  theater in World War II.  Mr. Henderson was the first black  man from the State of South Carolina  to have a commercial pilot license and  hold ground instructor, flight instruc tor, and  instrument  ratings.  In  the  years following the war, Ernest Hen derson became a great leader and edu cator in my State. South Carolinians  are extremely proud of Ernest Hender son, who has been an active  leader  throughout his life in church, educa tion, community, State, and national  affairs, especially in national defense  matters.  An article, by Sue Ellis in the State  Newspaper in Columbia, SC, entitled,  ""From Plow to Plane-Retired Educa tor Broke Ground  in Aviation,"" elo quently  presents  the  life  story  of  Ernest Henderson's climb  from  the  bottom to the top of the ladder of suc cess.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this fine newspaper article  about Mr. Ernest Henderson be pub lished in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  ""FROM PLow TO PLANE,"" NEIGHBORS SECTION,  THE STATE NEWSPAPER, COLUMBIA, SC  <By Sue Willis)  Ernest Henderson's childhood fascination  with soaring in the skies not only unexpect edly materialized  into a  career. but also  came to cast him in a vital role in breaking  the codes of prejudice that gripped World  War II America.

1575,1134,18,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator is correct, it would be subject  to a point of order under the Budget  Act because it would cause a  loss of  revenues.  ",1985
1576,1134,18,Mr. METZENBAUM.,"  Chair.  Mr. President, I believe that if we  are going  to give away $115 million  over the next 3 years to these particu lar interests, we should find a way to  replace the revenue. And I believe that  there is no one more able to do that  than  the distinguished chairman of  the Finance Committee, who  is also  the manager of the conference com mittee report. I believe  that the Fi nance Committee should be instructed  to report an amendment to the budget  reconciliation measure to accomplish  that objective.  I believe the fact that the reconcilia tion measure has not been put in place  and passed is no reason why we should  not act as if it were in place, because  we know it is a delay that should not  have occurred. But I am certain that  within a week or 10 days, the budget  reconciliation measure will be before  this body.  Mr. President,  I  believe  that we  ought to consider this conference com mittee report, not on some day long  distant in the future, but on some day  immediately after the budget reconcil iation measure has been adopted. I am  in no position to predict with accuracy  when that reconciliation measure will  be before the Senate, but I am advised  it should be here within the week. I  will say to my colleague, the manager  of the bill, that if it comes before that,  thank  I  the  the day after the reconciliation meas ure is disposed of is the time when I  believe we ought to have an opportuni ty to act in connection with the con ference report. I believe that is subject  to a point of order at that point. I do  not believe that the mere fact that we  are able to bring it up at this point by  agreement and cooperation of the par ties is any reason why any one of us  should not have an opportunity  to  raise the budget issue. We should not  take advantage of the date.  Therefore, I am not moving to elimi nate or to put aside  the conference  committee  report,  but  rather, Mr.  President, I move to postpone consid eration of the conference report until  October 10, 1985. This will give the Fi nance Committee time to report back  an amendment  to  the reconciliation  measure that raises at least $115 mil lion over the next 3 years.

1589,1147,18,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, today I  am reintroducing legislation to reform  the Social Security Disability  Insur ance [SSDil Program. This legislation  is  an  improved version of S.  2369,  which I  introduced on February 29,  1984, during the 98th Congress. This  year, I am pleased to have the senior  Senator from California  [Mr. CRAN STON]  joining with me in introducing  this legislation.  During the past 1% years,  I have  been working with  representatives  from a coalition of national organiza tions representing disabled persons in  an effort to improve the first version  of  this  legislation. Working  closely  with members of my staff, and after  months of meetings and review,  this  coalition has played a vital part  in  helping  to  design  significant  and  needed improvement in the SSDI Pro gram.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that a letter from this coalition of  national organization be reprinted im mediately following my remarks.  The  legislation we are  introducing  today  is  designed  to  improve  the  Social Security disability insurance de termination process  in  a way  that  better meets the needs of disabled per sons while  saving  Federal  dollars.  Rarely do we have the opportunity to  improve the working of a Federal pro gram, better meet  the needs of  its  beneficiaries, and save Federal funds. I  believe the legislation we are introduc ing today accomplishes all of those ob jectives.  RETIREMENT VERSUS DISABILITY  The origins of the Social Security  Disability Program demonstrate that  the program was not designed to meet  the unique needs of disabled persons.  The legislative history shows that the  first benefits for disabled persons-en acted in 1954 in Public Law 761, 83d  Congress-were not disability benefits.  Rather,  provisions were  enacted  to  protect retirement benefits for ""total ly disabled"" persons who were forced  to leave the work force prematurely.  This was the so-called disability freeze  provision.  To overcome the opposition to creat ing a new program specifically for dis abled persons, the proponents of dis ability  insurance  initially presented  their proposal as a modification of the  retirement program in the form of a  reduction in the retirement age of dis abled persons. In fact, the first cash  benefits for disabled persons-enacted  in 1955 in Public Law 880, 84th Con gress-was part of a package to reduce  the age that individuals become eligi ble  for  retirement benefits; disabled  persons at age 50 and women at age  62.  In 1960-enacted as Public Law 88778-the age  limitation for cash dis ability benefits was eliminated. Never theless,  the underlying basis of  the  program, that is, a cash benefit pro gram providing for  the early  retire ment. of disabled persons, have never  been modified. Although  over  the  years amendments were added to the  Social Security Act attempting to re",1985
1590,1160,18,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  for many years the people have recog nized that a menace has been growing  in Washington, DC, that threatens the  fiscal stability of the Government and  the  economic well-being  of  every  family  in  the Nation. The danger  arises  from massive  spending  pro grams that Congress has built into our  State and Federal systems over  the  past 50 years which are now increasing  at a  faster  rate  than our economic  growth  and outpacing  the people's  ability to pay for them.  Despite  the  imminent  danger  of  huge and mounting deficits, it is not  the Congress that is leading the fight  to reform the profligate spending pro grams that are now embedded in the  fabric of American law, it is the people  themselves! Just last year while we in  the Congress fiddled and once again  failed  to  control  runaway  Federal  spending, Missouri became  the 32d  State to petition Congress  to either  initiate  a  Federal  balanced  budget  amendment or to call a constitutional  convention for that purpose.  This grassroots effort  is mounting  because of the economic instability we  have experienced over the last decade  and a growing conviction that many of  our economic ills stem from skyrocket ing Federal deficits. Certainly we have  made progress in the last 3 years in  important  areas-inflation  is  down,  unemployment is down, interest rates  are down. However, ever-growing Fed eral deficits threatened to undermine  our recovery, sapping the new vitality  that we have worked so hard to attain.  While Congress has been vacillating,  citizens across the country have been  organizing a drive to call a constitu tional convention to develop and pass  a balanced budget amendment. In the  last 9 years, 32 States have passed pe titions calling for a convention and 11  States have passed them twice. It is  becoming  a  reasonable  expectation  that  the State  legislatures will  be  forced, by the failures of Congress, to  call for a constitutional convention to  consider  a  balanced budget  amend ment and thereby project the United  States  into an unprecedented situa tion.  To put this into perspective, article  V of the Constitution sets forth two  methods  of proposing  amendments.  One method allows two-thirds of both  Houses of Congress to propose a con stitutional amendment. Our Founding  Fathers provided another means that  could be used in the event that Con gress fails  to respond  to serious nationa!  problems.  The  Constitution  allows two-thirds of the State legisla tures to petition for the calling of a  constitutional convention. Historically,  Congress has taken the lead in propos ing amendments  to  the Constitution  to be later ratified by State legisla tures or by a State convention called  for  that purpose. However,  for  the  first  time since  the adoption of our  Constitution in 1778, it appears that a  constitutional  convention  will  be  called  before  Congress  passes  an  amendment to the Constitution.  Because Congress has an overriding  obligation to preserve the integrity of  the Constitution, it has now become  imperative that Congress map out a  procedure with necessary safeguards  to guarantee that the Constitution is  not weakened or destabilized by a con stitutional convention. There has been  considerable concern and debate about  the likelihood of limiting the debate to  a single purpose. However, there is a  reasonable basis for believing that a  constitutional convention can be limit ed  to  the consideration of  the bal anced budget amendment and  that  reasonable procedures can be estab lished for calling the convention, se lecting delegates, and setting up guide lines  that can remove much of  the  doubt and uncertainty that surrounds  the calling of such a convention.  A  1973 American Bar Association  study of  the convention method of  amending the constitution concluded:  Congress has the power to establish proce dures limiting a convention to the subject  matter which is stated in the applications  received from the State legislatures.  Former Senator Sam Ervin, a well respected  advocate  of  a  balanced  budget once stated:  Fear of a  runaway convention  is  just a  nonexistent constitutional ghost conjured  up by people who are opposed to balancing  the budget, because they want to be able to  promise special groups something for noth ing out of an empty pocketbook.  In addition, there are a number of  safeguards in place to prevent a consti tutional crisis from developing. For ex ample; < 1 > Congress can advance  its  own amendment making the calling of  a  convention  unnecessary-even  though to date it has not done so; <2>  it can refuse to submit nonconforming  amendments to the States for ratifica tion; (3) since the results of the con vention must be  ratified by  three fourths of the States, only 13 States  can block the action of the convention;  < 4 > and finally, Congress can set up  the procedures on how the convention  conducts itself.  I would prefer to see Congress pass a  balanced budget  amendment before  the  final  two States pass. petitions.  However, the immediacy of the situa tion  requires  that Congress address  the legitimate concerns of how a con stitutional convention should be orga",1985
1591,1186,18,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased that the Senate has turned to  consideration of Senate Resolution 68,  a resolution of mine marking an anni versary that is a source of both cele bration and concern.  Twenty-five years ago today, theRe public of Cyprus won  its  independ ence. After a  long and arduous proc ess, the Cypriot people won the right  of self -determination.  That alone makes today an impor tant occasion. The victory of freedom  is a source of celebration for all demo cratic nations. My  resolution  recog nizes this fact, and congratulates the  people of Cyprus on the 25th anniver sary of their independence.  For the people of Cyprus, however,  the determination  to build a nation  has been severely tested. The Cypriots  have been beset by violence. Their  land has been divided.  In fact,  the  Turkish Cypriots have attempted  to  declare one-half of the island a sepa rate nation. This is unacceptable, and  for that reason, Senate Resolution 68  reaffirms America's commitment  to  bring peace to Cyprus.

As Americans, we admire those who  perservere in the face of such chal lenges. We respect those who remain  steadfast in their commitment to de mocracy  and  freedom.  Throughout  their  first quarter-century of  inde pendence, the people of Cyprus have  displayed these qualities in abundance.  They have not wavered in their search  for freedom, and I believe the United  States should commend their courage  and heroism.  In addition, we must continue  to  press forward in helping the two com munities on Cyprus bring about a just  and  lasting peace  to  that  troubled  island.  I congratulate  the people of  Cyprus on  the 25th anniversary of  their independence and pray for many  future years of peace and prosperity.  ",1985
1593,1186,18,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, 25 years  ago today, after many years of strug gling for their independence, the Cyp riot people succeeded in establishing  the free and independent Republic of  Cyprus.  Generations  of  struggle  had  left  many important issues still unresolved  among the Greek and Turkish Cypri ots who share  the heritage of  that  beautiful Mediterranean  island, but  the new nation nevertheless set forth  to establish a homeland that would ac commodate the interests of all of its  inhabitants.  Unfortunately,  the Cypriots were  not to be left free to devise their own  accommodations,  on  two  occasions  Turkey threatened to intervene in the  affairs of the Republic of Cyprus, and  in 1974 finally carried out that threat  with a massive military  invasion of  40,000 Turkish  troops,  some  10,000  Cypriots, both Greek  and Turkish,  died in that invasion, 2,000 Greek Cyp riots disappeared but are believed to  be still alive today, and the fledgling  nation was divided, with 40 percent of  the land remaining in the hands of the  20,000 Turkish troops who are still on  the island today, 11  long years after  that brutally enforced partition. The  Turkish invaders have imposed 50,000  settlers  from  the Turkish mainland  upon the lands of 200,000 Greek Cyp riots, although more than 80 percent  ",1985
1594,1199,18,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Nothing we  do  here on the floor is going to produce  miracles for our farmers. Nothing we  do is going to save some folks who are  in such bad trouble they cannot be sal vaged. But this amendment does do a  couple of things as a matter of policy.  It targets aid to those who really need  it, it targets it to small and midsized  producers. That not only is popular,  particularly in urban constituencies in  this country, but it is right.  It also ensures that most farmers,  well over 95 percent, are not preju diced by this targeting. Only the very  largest farmers may get a little bit less  than they do right now, and not that  much less.  0 1305  Finally, what it would do is to pro vide a situation where we can get the  farmer competitive in the world mar kets and doing so in a way that shields  him,  that shields him  for  a  lower  market price.  So I would urge the Members to sup port this amendment knowing that it  does represent a deviation from cur rent farm policy. I am going to sup port this farm bill even if this amend ment does not pass, but I want to tell  the Members something: The current  farm bill is really nothing more than  an  extension  of  current  programs.  This is the way it is written now with  the exception of  the Bedell amend ment. This amendment makes some  changes in the way we have done busi ness, and a lot of people are scared of  that because it reflects a difference in  the way we provide for farm programs.  I still happen to believe that it reflects  a creative attempt to get dollars  to  those farmers who need it and to get  us competitive in the world markets.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. Mr.  Chairman, will the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1595,1199,18,Mr. GLICKMAN.," I yield to the gen tleman.  Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota. I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I think one of the im portant points that needs to be made  is that in most areas of the country,  most of the farmers' production will  be covered under this kind of a sup port price. Now, some people say well,  is this not discriminating against the  big versus the small and so on. The  answer to that is ""No."" What we are  saying is that there is only a certain  amount of money. We are going to use  it for a stronger support price, and  when we run out of money, we have  run out of money. That is kind of the  approach we are trying to take initial ly with the targeting amendment.  I think the gentleman's amendment,  although it does not go as far as the  amendment I had, is a good start in  targeting  farm  program  benefits.  I  would certainly commend the gentle man for his amendment.  ",1985
1596,1199,18,Mr. GLICKMAN., I  thank the gen tleman.  ,1985
1597,1199,18,Mr. MARLENEE.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman,  let us  look at the  bottom line of these targeting amend ments that are being offered. I rise in  opposition  to  this concept as being  alien to our concept of supporting the  hands-on family farmer.  Rather than promoting the family  farmer,  it seems to me that by  this  kind of legislation we are promoting  the  absentee  landlords  around  this  country. We are promoting the doctor,  who owns 100 acres of land or a half section of land. We are promoting the  attorney who owns a half-section or a  section of land. This is the most preva lent group  that  received  less  than  15,000 bushels as a crop share. We are  saying, ""Let us use our resources and  give  them more money than we are  giving  to  the hands-on producers of  this country, the people that need the  help.""  Of the 2.2 million farmers surveyed  in the 1982 Census, 1 million of these  people did not even consider  them selves producers. When asked flat out:  ""Are you an agricultural producer?""  They were  carried  on  the Census  forms  as producers, but  they  said,  ""Hey, we are not farmers"" when they  were asked flat out. Now through this  amendment we are targeting our pre cious resources, that should be going  to the family farmer, that should be  going to the hands-on producers, we  are  instead  targeting  it  to some of  these 1 million producers who  said  ""Hey we are not farmers.""  Also  in  that 1982 Census  survey,  farmers who had 100 acres or less were  categorized 65 percent absentee land lords, and you want to target our re sources to those people? To the doc tors, the lawyers, the retired farmers  who do not need  the assistance?  I  think we are going about this all in  the wrong way.  You know, the national wheat grow ers, the Montana wheat growers, any  wheat-growing organization does not  support  this concept. They support  the kind of commonsense  legislation  that was put together by ToM FOLEY  and myself which attempts to help the  hands-on producers. But  instead, we  have those here who are interested, in terested once again, in seeing that we  take it from those who have and give  ",1985
1598,1212,18,Mr. COMBEST.,"  I  appreciate  the  gentleman's comments, and I know we  are all very concerned about the direc tion of agriculture.  I would  just simply say that  this  does, in my opinion, set up a supply  management type program. It is vol untary mandatory, and I  think it is  one that will have some tremendous  effects on actually what the result is.  We are not setting ourselves up for  the situation that will allow the Gov ernment to acquire and to take over  great  numbers  of  stocks  because,  simply, the program is a recourse loan  rather than nonrecourse.  ",1985
1599,1212,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Washington  made  some  excellent  points in regard to this amendment. I  would, though, point out that when it  came up in the Committee it was de feated by one vote.  I wish at this point in time that we  had done a little more cleaning up of  this concept. We tried, and those of us  who support it-and I  intend to sup port  this amendment  today on  the  floor. I do so, in pointing out the gen tleman from Washington made some  arguments regarding the message that  this bill sends or that this amendment  sends. But I also rise at this point in  time to encourage all members of this  committee, particularly those on the  House  Agriculture  Committee,  to  listen to the arguments that have been  made in opposition to, as well as in  favor of the market loan approach.  We are going to have another oppor tunity in just a few moments to dis cuss the so-called Bedell amendment.  It is very interesting to listen to the  debate  today and  to guess what lies  ahead as we  talk about yet another  by  effective  concept. This one  is not necessarily  new. But  I want  to point out one  thing. My name has been used quite  often with  the Stenholm base and  yield bill, of which I take quite a lot of  pride, with my friend, the gentleman  from Kansas  [Mr.  RoBERTS]  who  worked so hard in this particular sec tion of the bill, in which we have at tempted to meet the market-oriented  needs of agriculture in allowing flexi bility of producers. This particular sec tion does not affect that.  It has been suggested that somehow  cross compliance has been brought in.  And  let  me  refresh  everyone's  memory. Cross compliance has to do  with an individual farmer participat ing in, let us say, the cotton program  up to the maximum amount allowed  under the limitation of payments and  then producing wheat on the rest of  his farm and staying out of the pro gram,  and  that  is  allowed.  If this  amendment passes, that will no longer  be allowed.  If you are for effective supply man agement, you need to be for cross com pliance.  What  do we mean  supply management?  For the last year and a half, I have  defined  effective  market-oriented  supply management  around  three  basic  principles. The  first  is,  the  United States will no longer act as the  world surplus disposing agent. No. 2,  the United States will not subsidize its  producers to overproduce. And, No. 3,  the United States will act to protect  farm income up to a certain point.  Today we are talking about target ing of benefits. That is another way of  saying that the United States and this  Congress is going to have to come to  grips with the budget implications of  farm bills.  Now, I do not particularly subscribe  to the targeting as it is done in this  bill. It has got some real problems, and  there  is no point  in continuing the  debate. Those who have opposed  it  based on that I think are correct. But  let me sum up by saying the first point  that I mentioned can further be de fined by saying we should not give  price windfalls to nonparticipants  in  farm  programs. Under  the  current  farm program, and  those who have  come before it, we will see that we con tinue to give benefits to nonprogram  participants. That  is  a  very major  weakness of current farm legislation.  No. 2, we should not encourage ex pansion by foreign producers. I submit  should this amendment pass today it is  a message that needs to be sent to the  rest of the world. We are going to get  very competitive. We are going to hold  the farmer harmless in regard to this  particular issue. It it budget responsi ble. And that argument has been well  made, because the cost of the loan, if  the Government  ends up  assuming  the  is paid by  that grain,  that cost  same Treasury.  The third point that I would like to  make  to  this argument  is  that we  should avoid sudden demand shocks to  agribusiness in rural communities, and  this amendment proposes  a  certain  amount of  supply management. No  question about that. It will not work  any other way. In fact, I think it will  be very effective supply management  because it is truly a voluntary manda tory approach.  Now, you are going  to hear  in a  moment  those who  argue  that we  ought  to have mandatory  controls.  This one lets anybody produce. Any body can farm, anybody can go out  and raise all of the wheat that they  particularly want to. They do not have  to set aside anything if this amend ment should pass. It is complete, total  freedom.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from Texas  [Mr.  STEN HOLM] has expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. STEN HOLM was allowed to proceed for 2 ad ditional minutes.)  ",1985
1600,1212,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, it  is complete and total freedom of an in dividual farmer  to produce for  that  world market if he chooses not to par ticipate  in  the  supply management  features that are a part of this amend ment.  The last point that I would like to  speak to in regard to this amendment  and  the one  that  is going  to come  later-because again I point out it is  very interesting to listen to the debate  for and against this amendment and to  guess what is going to come when we  get into the Bedell amendment. The  chairman  said  a moment  ago we  should not gamble at this time. I am  going  to point out that same state ment on Bedell, because it is one that  we have got to think about. We spent  a lot of time in the Agriculture Com mittee doing this. We should not con tinue the status quo in the farm bill.  We should serve notice to our for eign competitors that we will compete  in terms of both price and supply.  Now, if that is what we really want  to do,  folks,  this amendment  is one  way to do it. This is a good, quick way  for us to get there.  So again let me point out, this does  not have an adverse effect upon the  base and yield section. It is still an in tegral part of the farm bill as I had  hoped that it would be. Cross compli ance is a separate issue that must be  taken into consideration. It is a part of  this amendment. Individuals need  to  make their minds up on that judgment  based on your own opinion.  I  said,  this  is  not  a  perfect  amendment. The House Agriculture  Committee has spent many hours of  debate on this. The chairman is per fectly correct in saying that we should  As  ",1985

1606,1251,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  commend the distinguished gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. FEIGHAN] for his initi ative in organizing this special order  on Cyprus. This  is especially perti nent, given  the  recent  rejection by  Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denk tash, of the U.N. Secretary General's  Cyprus initiative, agreed to in March  by Cyprus President Spyros Kyprian ou, the Greek Cypriot leader.  This has in effect-let us hope tem porarily-dashed the hopes of the citi zens of Cyprus that they might see an  end to the 11-year occupation and divi sion of  their homeland. Since 1974,  when  200,000 Greek Cypriots were  driven from  their home by  invading  Turkish soldiers,  the tiny island has  remained partitioned and occupied in  part by the Turkish soldiers, as well as  Turkish colonists who were lured from  the mainland by the promise of land  that had belonged to Greek Cypriots.  It is true that Turkey is an impor tant United States ally, but we are  dealing here with some fundamental  issues of international law and morali ty. Turkey invaded and continues to  occupy the territory of a formerly sov ereign nation, and the Turkish Repub lic of Northern Cyprus  is an  illegal  declaration of statehood,  recognized  by Turkey  alone.  Efforts  by  the  United States urging Turkey to end its  obstinacy and reach a solution have  been to no avail, despite the generous  amounts of aid granted to that coun try yearly. This special order serves as  a vehicle in expressing the growing im patience among Members of Congress  and the Nation at large over this proc ess. American aid, in addition to being  of strategic help to this nation, is sup posed  to  reflect American values of  justice  and  fair  play. The Turks  appear bent on a permanent division  of the island of Cyprus, and the issue  continues to fester.  I hope that this special order might  contribute to arriving at a just and eq uitable solution to the Cyprus issue.  ",1985
1607,1251,18,Mr.  FEIGHAN.,  I  thank my  col league from California for joining us  today in this special order.  ,1985
1608,1251,18,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1985
1609,1251,18,Mr. FEIGHAN., I am happy to yield  to the gentleman from Florida.  ,1985
1610,1251,18,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to commend my colleague  from Ohio [Mr. FEIGHAN] along with  my other colleagues for the initiative  he has demonstrated by  taking out  this special order on this truly historic  day. It is action and involvement like  his that is necessary now in order to  encourage a solution to the problems  of Cyprus which is so close and yet so  far away.  I would  like to personally  thank him and extend my hope that  the gentleman will  be an example  which many others will follow.  Mr. Speaker,  today  the people of  Cyprus celebrate an anniversary and I,  too, would like to join my colleagues in  extending my  heartfelt  congratula tions to them on this, the silver anni versary, of the Republic's independ ence. I only wish and pray that this  event were one  that could be ade quately marked by celebration alone.  The unfortunate reality, however,  is  that there are many problems yet to  be  resolved before Cyprus can cele brate its true independence. It is our  duty and obligation to draw attention  to them.  Before we discuss the issue, however,  I would like to take a moment to com mend the brave and noble citizens of  Cyprus for the resolve and strength of  character  they  have  demonstrated  throughout these difficult years. The  people of this island nation have had  to endure many hardships, injustices,  and insults throughout the years, but  they have endured. Their loved ones  have been  lost,  their  families have  been uprooted, their homes have been  destroyed, but they continue to perse vere. They are  indomitable because  justice  is  indomitable. Their  right  shall make right. This day truly be longs to them.  This is a day of which every Cypriot  can be proud, for it marks a milestone  in a long and just struggle for a free  and independent country to call their  own. The struggle continues and it is  still  just. The Cypriots continue  to  face many  forces  that threaten  the  indpendence  of  their  country,  and  they  continue  to  demonstrate  the  character and spirit that seeks to pre vail in their noble cause. The interna tional community must now step  in  and assist  this  just cause, for  those  forces  that would undermine the in tegrity of Cyprus have been allowed to  fester too long. It is now time for all  freedom-loving nations, especially the  United States, to stand up and have  their voices heard. It is time we speak  up  for what  is  right  and  fair  in  Cyprus. It is time we do our part to  help Cyprus finally achieve the inde pendence and sovereignty  that  it  is  celebrating.  Mr. Speaker, we, in Congress, are in  a  particularly  favorable  position  to  contribute to a resolution of the cur rent stalemate which has left Cyprus  partitioned  into Greek-Cypriot  and  Turkish-Cypriot  sectors  since  the  Turkish  invasion of 1974. For  this  reason, I invited the Cypriot Ambassa dor to the United States, His Excellen cy Andrew J. Jacovides, to brief Mem bers of Congress on the Cyprus issue  on September 18. Mr. Jacovides' re marks were very useful, and informa tive, and emphasized the consistently  positive stand of the Cyprus Govern ment and the Greek Cypriot communi ty during the various efforts toward a  negotiated settlement of the Cyprus  issue.  No one can deny that the Cypriot  government and Greek-Cypriot com munity have done more than their fair  share  in  encouraging  a  settlement  throughout  the  years.  They  have  made many painful concessions in an  effort to bring harmony to the island  which have not only not been matched  by  the other  side,  but have been  thwarted by them. The Turkish-Cypri ot community has even, in direct viola tion  of  relevant U.N.  resolutions,  taken a series of actions, subsequent to  the 197 4 invasion, which are aimed at  consolidating the occupation and divi sion of that small Mediterranean re public. For example,  as  recently as  1983, there was even an illegal attempt  to  create  a  new Turkish  political  entity  in the occupied areas. Fortu nately, this unprecedented secessionist  action was promptly labled as illegal  and unaceptable by the international  community and received the condem nation that is so well deserved. Yet it  illustrates all too well the staunch and  dogmatic attitude of the Turkish and  Turkish-Cypriot  communities which  has prevented the attainment of a just  solution to the problems of the repub lic throughout these long, sad years.  Their detrimental actions have not  ceased there. Contrast the following if  you will. First, Cyprus has agreed to  place internal security and the protec tion of human rights of all Cypriots  under international supervision for as  long as necessary while Turkey refuses  to accept any  impartial  third-party  international body on Cyprus. Second,  Cyprus has agreed to a bicameral leg islative  constitutional  arrangement  under which Greek and Turkish Cyp riots will be represented equally in the  upper house, that is, 50-50, and pro portionally to the population ratio in  the lower house, that is, 80-20 while  Turkey demands 50-50 representation  ",1985

1612,1264,18,Mr. THOMAS of Georgia.," I  my colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to  join with the many friends of Walter  Harrison in this tribute. This is a very  special time for me because Mr. Harri son was a resident of Millen, GA,  in  my congressional district, and he was a  wonderful friend and a  trusted coun selor to me for a number of years.  The death of Colonel Harrison, as  many of us called him, was an event  that means many things to me person ally.  On one hand, it marked the loss of a  light of  leadership  that we had all  come to depend on for decades. It was  a sad and tragic loss for our State and  our Nation.  But from another perspective, his  passing has led me and many others to  reflect on, and celebrate, the joy that  comes from the life of a man who gave  much more than he took. That is the  heart and soul of Walter Harrison-a  man who dedicated himself to public  service in the highest and finest sense  of the word.  I often dropped by to visit Mr. Harri son in his office at the Millen News,  the paper that he loved and edited for  years. His desk was always cluttered  with  the materials  of  his  latest  projects and  latest battles, and his  walls were covered with  the awards  and tributes of past accomplishments.  In the space of a few moments, Mr.  Harrison would make you at home  with his booming and resonant voice  of welcome, have you in a chair, and  launch into questions and statements  about issues ranging from outer space  to historic  renovation. He had  that  special spark of enthusiasm that even  at age 85 allowed him to take a listen er and transform that person into a  partner-a partner in his latest project  for the public good.  I  left  the House  floor  just a  few  months ago to go downtown here in  Washington to celebrate with Colonel  Harrison when he was  inducted into  the Cooperative League of the USA  Hall of Fame  in  recognition of his  work in behalf of rural electrification.  I drove to his home in Millen this past  May to visit with him during his ill ness, and he was a man facing that ill ness with characteristic courage. He  turned aside questions about his phys ical condition and instead was full of  questions and comments of his own  about the many issues in which he was  still involved.  The work of Colonel Harrison  in  regard to electric power is legendary,  and the public record of his life will  show that he was the pioneer who had  the  insight  and  skill  to make  the  dream of universal electric service a  reality in my State.  It is hard to imagine a Georgia or an  America today that was ever without  electricity, and yet that was ju~t the  situation for most of the land area of  my State at about  the  time of my  birth. It took men like Walter Harri son to recognize that affordable elec tric power was the foundation of any  effort to pull rural America from eco nomic stagnation, and it took men like  Walter Harrison to turn what was a  dream into a reality.  I will not dwell on Mr. Harrison's ac complishments regarding rural electri fication because  that  is well  estab lished  in  the public  record. But we  should take special note that he had  the vision to select the great issue of  his day as the goal of his professional  life, and we should remember that he  developed a remarkable array of skills  to accomplish his goal.  I say that because Colonel Harrison  was a man who combined the tough ness of a drill sergeant with the speak ing skills of a great preacher, and a  heart as big as the Nation he loved. He  was a soft touch for anyone in need,  and he responded to every appeal for  assistance with a worthy cause.  For any normal man, Colonel Harri son's work with rural electrification  would have left no time for other af fairs, but that was not his nature. He  was a tireless servant to the public and  was elected to just about every office  he ever cared to hold, from council man and mayor to State senator. He  was a renaissance man of rural Amer ica.  Mr.  Speaker, with  the  death  of  Walter Harrison, our Nation has lost a  dynamic  leader, and  I  have  lost  a  treasured friend.  Our  tributes  to him are from our  hearts, but no matter what words of  honor we may speak, none can do him  greater tribute than the monuments  of accomplishment that he fashioned  with his own deeds. We take comfort  in the fact that his accomplishments  will stand strong and tall long after we  in this Chamber are gone.  It was a privilege for me  to know  Walter Harrison. It was an honor to  count him as a friend. He brought the  light of electric power to generations  of Americans, but more importantly,  he taught us that the light within our selves is more powerful than any ob stacle to a worthwhile goal.  May God bless that great man and  may God  comfort  his  family  and  hometown friends.  I would like to conclude my remarks  by inserting into the RECORD the com ments of a man who knew and loved  Walter Harrison  for many, many  years. He is Mr. Frank Edenfield, the  publisher of the Millen News a man  with great insight into his beloved city  of Millen and rural Georgia. The fol lowing editorial, which was published  in the Millen newspaper on August 15  of this year, is the finest testament I  have seen to one of the finest men I  have ever known:  ",1985
1613,1277,18,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues a  valedictorian address recently delivered by  a Florida high school student.  Her name  is Kimberly Anne Ackourey,  valedictorian of the 1985 graduating class  of Pope John Paul II High School in Boca  Raton.  Ms. Ackourey's address is a stirring trib ute to the indomitable nature of the human  spirit. It is a call to action, a plea for com passion in our troubled age. It speaks to  what is good and giving in each of us. The  youthful author of these words has wisdom  beyond her years, Mr. Speaker, and I com mend her thoughts to my colleagues.  After four years of high school we have  learned about past and present peoples and  cultures. We have formed relationships with  others and have  received an encouraging  sense of accomplishment from both our par ents and our  teachers. We have become  well-rounded individuals who are capable of  making great contributions  to  the world.  The values we have formed at Pope John  Paul II High School will guide us in actions  we will take.  Moral values are more  than persuasive  words that are instilled in the family and in  the classroom. They are demonstrative ex pressions of our love and concern for others.  These values have been enhanced by our  communications with fellow students, facul ty, and staff. They are evident in school  projects, such as in the collection of food  for the poor and in visiting the aged. We  search for a meaningful life filled with in terest because we dread monotony and bore dom. By knowing our fundamental beliefs,  we will be able to live this full and varied  life that each of us strives for.  Advancement characterizes our age. The  whole world will be living with the increas ing  implications of nuclear weapons and  energy, space travel, computer technology  and medical innovations. However, science  and industry cannot decide our future. We,  acting as educated individuals, are the only  ones who can make this decision. We of the  graduating class have developed realistic at titudes about our future by becoming more  informed. We have learned to avoid George  Orwell's dismal concept of 1984, and have  adopted Sir Charles Snow's belief of the im portance of combining humanism with tech nology. By understanding  ourselves  and  where we are going, we will not allow such  technology to change the goals in our lives.  Our morals allow us to view  technology  from a more altruistic perspective. Continu ous development is not only imperative, but  it is also inevitable. Advancement must be  applied, therefore, for the benefit and not  the destruction of mankind. Our attitudes  will influence the attitudes of those in the  future, and we must realize our power to  change  situations  in  the world-such as  world hunger and the threat of nuclear hol ocaust. As Albert Einstein once wrote: ""We  have the means to get almost anywhere.""  We graduates have the potential to become  the people we wish to become. We can con tribute  to  society now and  far  into  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  future by believing in ourselves and by uti lizing our skills for the betterment of all.  Justice William 0. Douglas, a great Ameri can who took the path that many of us will  take, emphasized the importance of respon sibility and contribution to society when he  said: ""I hope that America's only dream of  empire will be the common good of human ity. I hope America will come to realize that  her strength is not in fire power but in ideas  of justice, tolerance, equality. We have a de cisive role to play.""  We,  the 1985 graduating class of Pope  John Paul II High School, must now decide  what this role will be. We have many oppor tunities before us, many paths to follow. I  wish each and everyone of you, my fellow  students, the greatest happiness in whichev er route you choose to take. May you always  realize your vast potential and have  the  courage needed to reach all of your goals.  LEA COUNTY-CHAMPION COW BOY CAPITOL OF THE WORLD  HON. BILL RICHARDSON  OF NEW MEXICO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 1, 1985  ",1985
1614,1277,18,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, cow boys and cowgirls are as much a part of  our country's  traditions as  apple pie.  I  want my distinguished colleagues to know  that New Mexicans proudly boast that Lea  County  in  the Southeastern part of my  State is still the champion cowboy capitol  of the world. I hope my distinguished col leagues will take the opportunity to read a  recent article that appeared in New Mexico  Magazine, entitled: ""Lea County-Champi on Cowboy Capitol of the World,'' and meet  some of New Mexico's champions:  LEA COUNTY-CHAMPION COWBOY CAPITOL OF  THE WORLD  <By Douglas Kent Hall)  Mention New Mexico and hardly anyone  automatically thinks of cowboys. Once we  get beyond whatever  the public  relations  people might mean by ""The Land of En chantment,"" our  response might first  in clude images of Indians selling jewelry on  the plaza in Santa Fe. But the truth is, New  Mexico is also a great cowboy state.  I discovered this while writing and photo graphing my book Working Cowboys. Natu rally, I started out in Texas. But I was re peatedly steered back to New Mexico, where  many  legendary cowboys punch cows on  ranches  larger and wilder  than the more  famous spreads in Texas or anyplace else.  The people of Lea County, for instance down in the southeastern part of the state,  where Indians are few and the natural beau ties normally associated with New Mexico  are almost nonexistent-aren't going to let  you forget about their cowboys.  Lea County is more likely to be labeled oil  country  than  cattle  country  because  it  seems to a traveler driving thought that see sawing oil pumps far out number the stock.  But while Lea County cowboys will admit  that oil pays a  lot of  the country's bills,  they still maintain that this is prime cowboy  country. And  that's no  idle boast. They  measure and back it up by the number of  cowboys who have been bred here on the  high plains beyond the caprock and then  gone on to be world champion rodeo per formers.  25501  Tuffy Cooper, himself a champion roper  and an avid supporter of the Lea County  Fair and Rodeo as well as the Lea County  Cowboy Hall of Fame, can tick the names of  their  famous cowboys off on his  fingers.  ""George Wier was world champion in 1917.  Ricahrd Merchant held the title in 1923 or  '24. Then Jake McClure came along in the  late '30s and early '40s. Troy Fort was the  next one; he was world champions calf roper  in 1947 and 1949. I was the first national  intercollegiate calf-roping champion. We've  had many national high school champions.  My daugher, Betty Gail Cooper, was  the  first national girl champion in college rodeo.  She went on to become the World Champi on All-Around Cowgirl, a title she's held for  the last two years. My son, Roy Cooper, was  the National High School Champion All Around Cowboy, the National Inter-Collegi ate Champion All-Around Cowboy,  the  PRCA Rookie  of  the Year,  the World  Champion Roper for six years,  then  the  World Champion All-Around Cowboy  for  two years. My nephew, Jimmy Cooper, was  World Champion All-Around Cowboy  two  years ago .... ""  If there are a  few names Tuffy can't  recall, Fern Sawyer, a World Champion All Around Cowgirl, unofficial national ambas sador  for  rodeo and one of  the original  founders of the Lea County Rodeo, can cer tainly supply them. And she would add to  her list the name of the great roper, Bob  Crosby. ""He's not from this county-he was  born just over the line in Chaves County but he came to all our rodeos and we sure  like to claim him.""  Tuffy and I sit in his comfortable ranch  house near Monument,  south of Hobbs.  Tuffy is tall, lean, in late middle age, and  has an incredible smile that shows a lot of  teeth and lights up his whole face. In front  of me is a glass-topped coffee table at least  10 feet long and two feet wide that is filled  with solid silver trophy buckles inlaid with  gold and rubies worth a small fortune-evi dence of  this  family's dedication  to  the  sport of rodeo. I ask him why one county  could produce so much cowboy talent, and  he lays it to survival. ""You either have to  rope or work,"" Tuffy says with a grin. ""It's  kind of like some of the blacks in the ghet tos; they have to work to get out of their  poverty. It's the same here. Ranching is a  tough life.""  I drove down to Lovington last August to  the Lea County Fair and Rodeo <August 1417  this year>  to see what made  the Lea  County cowboys so formidable on the world  circuit. Two hundred miles out of Santa Fe  the sun stopped shining. The kind of vicious  black  clouds  that  sweep  through West  Texas hung on the horizon; wind and light ning started and sheets of rain feel, making  rivers of the roads and brining floods down  from the arroyos southeast of Roswell.  I found Tuffy, who is head of the rodeo  committee, in the rodeo office on the fair grounds. He was optimistic. He figured the  rain would stop by rodeo time; if not-well,  it didn't matter. They'd never cancelled a  performance because of weather.  Joe Bob Feller, one of the rodeo clowns  and bullfighters, was waiting out the storm  in the office. I asked him how it was, fight ing bulls  in  the mud. ""The worst part's  gettin' your feet wet,"" he laughed. ""After  that it's all downhill.""  In the late afternoon the rain let up brief ly, but just before rodeo time a fresh bank  of clouds blew in and it began again. The  downpour increased as time for the grand  entry parade approached.  .  ",1985
1615,1303,18,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak  in recognition of the fact that the Govern ment of the United States has invested bil lions of dollars  to  improve  the mental  health of its citizens. In exchange for this  investment we have generally achieved re sults that are exemplary. Part of the reason  for the great success of this program is the  intense dedication and high degree of pro fessionalism shown by the workers and ad ministrators who  have  implemented  the  program throughout the Nation.  One outstanding example of the kind of  magnificent, professional leader in the field  of community mental health who has made  the movement a success was the late Paul  J. Cooper, Brooklyn regional director for  the New York City Department of Mental  Health.  In honor of Paul Cooper's outstanding  achievements  in  the  field of community  mental health it has been proposed that the  Ocean-Hill Brownsville Community Mental  Health Clinic be renamed the Paul Cooper  Community Mental Health Clinic. A cere mony  in honor of Paul Cooper  is being  sponsored by the clinic on Sunday, October  11, 1985, at St. Ignatius Loyola Parish Hall  on Rogers A venue between Carroll Street  and Crown Street at 3 p.m.  Paul J. Cooper served as regional admin istrator for the New York City Department  of Mental Health from 1972 to 1982. Prior  to this appointment he served as the execu tive director of the Brownsville Community  Corp. from 1968 to 1972. During his period  of service as the chief administrator of the  Brownsville  community  action  program,  Paul Cooper assisted board chairlady Doro thy Deschamps and clinic director Evelyn  Abelson  in  establishing  an  independent  community-based mental health clinic di rectly licensed by the State of New York.  The clinic, which is presently located at  Utica Avenue and Lincoln Place, bas a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  staff of nearly 120 workers. It offers a vari ety of outpatient psychiatric services; coun seling  for  alcoholics;  and  it  supervises  homes for  the mentally retarded. The re sponsibilities of the clinic were recently ex panded when it was awarded a contract to  administer  two additional homes  for  the  mentally retarded.  From the startup of this vitally needed  community-based  institution  until  his  death, Paul Cooper  answered  numerous  calls for help and played an invaluable role  in maintaining funds for the clinic during  periods when  the  city was under great  fiscal strain and eliminating many commu nity-based  operations. Paul Cooper was  truly  the great protector  for community  mental  health  services  in  the  central  Brooklyn  communities  of  Brownsville,  Ocean-Hill, and Crown Heights.  Paul J. Cooper was born on January 16,  1917, and died on March 29, 1984. He is sur vived by his wife, Annie V. Cooper. Paul  Cooper was  a  dedicated member who  served  in the highest leadership positions  of the Widow's Son Lodge No. 11 of the  Prince Hall Masons. He also achieved the  high honor of serving as the Most Worship ful Grand Master of New York State. The  credo of service of his Masonic order was  always  reflected  in  the community out reach and dedication of Paul J. Cooper.  DR. SAMUEL B.

1616,1303,18,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  Friday, October 4,  1985, Dr. Samuel B.  Goodson will be honored as  the HEAR  Center Man of the Year with the receipt of  the  Glen  H.  Bollinger  Humanitarian  Award.  Born  in Canada  in 1914, Dr. Goodson  came to the United States as a 10-year-old  boy and attended schools in Illinois and In diana. After graduation from the Universi ty of Illinois College of Medicine in 1942,  he volunteered for the service and served  as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Force  Medical Corps; he soon attained the rank  of captain.  At the end of the war, Dr. Goodson re sumed his education, then moved to Cali fornia in 1952 to establish a medical prac tice  specializing  in  eye,  ear,  nose,  and  throat. Two years later he became one of  the founding members of the board of di rectors of the HEAR Center, a nonprofit  organization that has freed countless chil dren from the world of silence. The center  provides  training  to  both  children  and  adults with hearing and/or speech prob lems and enables them to take an active  role in their community despite deafness or  hearing difficulties.  It has  taken people with  special skill,  dedication, and  responsibility  to provide  the needed services and achieve the goals  of the HEAR Center. Dr. Goodson is such a  25527  person and he has significantly touched the  lives of thousands of individuals who are  deaf or hard of hearing. I am honored to  add my congratulations  to  the many Dr.  Goodson is receiving on this auspicious oc casion.  THE RETIREMENT OF COL. DALE  L. BRAKEBILL  HON. JIM CHAPMAN  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 1, 1985  ",1985
1617,1303,18,Mr. CHAPMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  in all of  the debate regarding America's defense re quirements, little mention is made of one  of the most important factors in America's  defense readiness, the moral of our fighting  men. There is little more important to the  defense of our Nation than those human  factors  which  determine  whether  our  Armed Forces can meet the challenges pre sented them.  Over the last 30 years, U.S. Air Force has  enjoyed the faithful service of one of my  constituents, Col. Dale L. Brakebill. Colo nel Brakebill began his Air Force career  with the Reserve Officers Training Corps at  Texas Christian University  in 1955. Since  that time, his personnel responsibilities in  the Air Force have spanned the globe, from  special  services  officer  for  the 5th Air  Force at Nagoya and Fuchu, Japan, to ex ecutive officer to the deputy chief of staff  for personnel at Headquarters U.S. Air  Force, Pentagon. He has served as base  commander at Travis Air Force Base, CA,  in numerous capabilities at the Air Force  Manpower and Personnel Center at Ran dolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, to  his  final assignment as assistant deputy  chief of staff for personnel, Headquarters  Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Pat terson Air Force Base, OH. Make no mis take, Mr. Speaker, that personnel manage ment in the Air Force is a most difficult as signment.  During  his  tenure,  Colonel  Brakebill has devoted hard work, commit ment, and expertise to the Air Force, be coming one of its valued experts  in  the  area of personnel management. His devo tion  to  service bas won him numerous  awards  and  decorations,  including  the  Legion of Merit,  the Meritorious Service  Medal,  the Joint Service Commendation  Medal, and  the Air Force Commendation  Medal.  It is indeed my pleasure to join Colonel  Brakebill's many friends and colleagues in  saluting him for his dedicated service  to  our Nation's defense. His dedication  to  duty, and willingness to go the extra mile  to assure that the U.S. defense is second to  none will be sorely missed. I join with the  people of Mount Vernon, TX, all of Frank lin County, and his fellow citizens from the  First District of Texas, in saying, ""Thank  you, Colonel Brakebill,  for  a  job well  done.""  ",1985
1618,11,22,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Speaker and my  colleagues, in 1978 Congress adopted a  law. That law said that we are going to  balance the budget. We are going to  balance the budget by 1981.  Well, 1981 came and went; the defi cits remained, and the deficits have  grown. I think it is clear that we need  something with teeth, ladies and gen tlemen. We  need  an  enforcement  mechanism  that will work. Gramm Rudman, for all of its deficiencies, has  at least one positive feature:  It has  teeth, it has molars, biscuspids; it has  got teeth.  The Democratic alternative that is  going  to be proposed  today  retains  that feature, and I  think it also im proves considerably on several of the  deficiencies  of  the Gramm-Rudman  proposal.  We will speak  today of pain,  the  kind of pain that serious budget defi cit reduction will cause programs for  housing, crime victims, children, de fense and so forth. Let us remember,  however, that there is a lot of pain out  there that is caused by an out-of-con trol national debt of $2  trillion: The  pain of trade deficits for $150 billion  and the loss of 2 million American jobs  since 1980. We can best  fight  that  pain, ladies and gentlemen, by taking  some  tough medicine  today:  The  Democratic alternative  is  that medicine.  A SHOTGUN WEDDING  <Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1985
1619,11,22,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  in  1930 the poverty level in America was  50 percent; in 1980 it was 11 percent;  with Gramm-Latta in 1985, it is 15 per cent. What will  it be  in 1991 with  Gramm-Rudman?  I am not particularly crazy about  either of the deficit reduction plans  that will be brought today before the  House, but I will say this: Many people  are worried, if they would vote against  these measures they would be called  special interest Congressmen.  Well, I have to say that I will not  apologize  for supporting senior citi zens, poor children, food stamps and  nutrition  programs  for  our  poor  people, and I do not think we should  apologize for it.  I  think Members of this House do  not really understand either of those  reduction plans; they were hastily put  together, and we have a shotgun wed ding here today to try and resolve a  A MAJOR CRIME WITHOUT A  CRIMINAL  <Mr. HUGHES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
1620,11,22,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker, the De partment of Justice  seems  to have  brought about another of its continu ing series of miracles in modem Amer ican  jurisprudence-a major  crime  without a criminal.  Rockwell International Corp., which  had $6.2 billion in defense contracts  last year, has been allowed to plea bar gain away criminal charges of fraudu lently  billing  the Government  for  $300,000.  The maximum fine that the compa ny can receive is $200,000, which is, as  usual, less than the amount ripped off  from the Government. The company  also agreed  to make restitution and  pay the cost of the investigation.  Although  the Government alleges,  and the company admits by its guilty  plea, that at least six employees falsi fied time cards on a $3.6 million con tract,  no  individuals were  charged.  This case thus takes place along side  its felonious siblings-Bank of Boston,  E.F. Hutton,  Sperry,  and General  Electric, in which companies miracu lously scheme,  formulate, and carry  out criminal activities without any in dividuals being criminally involved.  This case is even more disturbing in  that Rockwell has apparently been  charged with similar overcharging at  least twice in recent years, but spared  a trip to the woodshed, most recently  in 1982, when the company was spared  criminal prosecution and debarment  from  additional Pentagon  contracts  upon its promise not to repeat the of fense-the exact offense that the Jus tice Department has  this week plea  bargained away.  Regrettably, the disturbing trend in  which  the  rich  and well-connected  have a corporation to hide behind are  allowed  to go  free  if  they return a  piece of what they have stolen, while  the ordinary  citizen has  the book  thrown at him,  finds  yet  another  shameful example.  THE SPENDERS AND THE  BUILDERS  <Mr. WALKER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.>  ",1985
1621,11,22,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, when it  comes to deciding economic matters in  this House, there are essentially two  groups that we fall into in this body:  The spenders and the builders. The  spenders are those who believe that  Government itself can be the solution  to  the problems. The builders  are  people who believe that society offers  the kind of solutions that go beyond  Government.  What we have today is two alterna tives before us: One brought to you by  the spenders, one brought to you by  the builders. What we  are  saying,  what you are hearing from the Demo crats is: Trust the spenders. What we  are asking you  to do  is: Trust  the  builders.  FIFTY PERCENT CUT IN BUTTER  GIVEAWAYS TO POOR HURTS  DISADVANTAGED UNFAIRLY  <Mr. WILSON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.>  ",1985
1622,11,22,Mr. WILSON.," Mr. Speaker, Mem bers of the House, there is a situation  that I think most of us may not know  about that has occurred in October, in  which the butter allotment from the  commodity program for the very poor est of the poor  in our country has  been cut by 50 percent.  Now, this has been done at the insti gation of the margarine lobby, which  ",1985
1623,37,22,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from New  York [Mr. HORTON].  ",1985
1624,37,22,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition  to  the Rostenkowski pro posal. I do so on the basis that I think  this is a very complicated process that  has  been  suggested. The Gramm Rudman proposal was presented  to  the conference. As a member of the  conference, I sat through hour after  hour after hour of meetings. During  the conference we formed task forces,  and we worked together on those task  forces, Republicans and Democrats, to  try to come up with a proposal that  could be acceptable. I think it is unf or tunate that we do not have before us  now-and I think we were very close to  it-a proposal that could be accepted  by both sides, that could be presented  here this afternoon on the floor so we  could move forward and address other  matters.  As a matter of fact,  I voted with  some of the Republicans and Demo crats  to  accelerate  the  Gramm Rudman and make  it applicable  to  fiscal year 1986.  I have no problem  with immediate action to reduce the  deficit. What we are finding is a situa tion in which we are never going to  arrive at a balanced budget unless we  do something drastic. That is what the  Gramm-Rudman process and trigger is  all about. But there is available to us  the opportunity for  the Senate and  the House and the Executive to meet  these  budget  deadlines  and  these  budget goals that we set within a cer tain period without having to pull the  trigger.  Excessive Federal deficits and a na tional debt that approaches $2 trillion  stand as  the most serious domestic  problems facing our Nation today. All  Americans are affected. Future gen erations are affected,  for  it  is  they  who must repay this debt.  No end is in sight to these spiraling  deficits and debt. That is the problem  we have been attempting  to  resolve  these past few weeks. The mandatory  deficit reduction packages and propos als we have considered have been criti cized by people in both parties, and by  individuals and organizations reflect ing  the entire spectrum of political  thought. But the bottom line is this:  Discipline  is needed  in  the Federal  budget process. Discipline  is needed  because  the current budget process  doesn't work. It is Just that simple.  Sequestration is the key element in  the  two proposals we will  consider  today. The central issue dividing me  and other conferees was which pro grams would be subject to the seques tration process and which would be  a;  exempt. I have a large folder stuffed  with letters from practically every or ganization imaginable expressing their  concern over the need to reduce the  Federal deficit, but not in their specif ic program. All of their arguments are  good ones. They make sense. By and  large,  the programs authorized and  funded by  the Federal Government  play essential roles in our society.  However,  the  deficits  and  debt  remain  as  constant and growing  threat to the stability of our economy,  and to our Nation's ability to compete  in an increasingly competitive world  market-today and  in  the future as  well.  Let us not forget that the sequestra tion process is triggered only if we fail  to meet the projected budget targets.  We  in Congress  ultimately  decide  whether that trigger will be pulled.  But my point is this: If the trigger is  pulled, then all must share in the re ductions that are mandated. The $93  billion in added exemptions provided  by this amendment does not contrib ute to this principle of fairness and  equity.  ",1985
1625,37,22,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, will my  friend, the gentleman from New York,  yield?  ",1985
1626,37,22,Mr. HORTON.," I only have 3 min utes, but  I  yield  to  the gentleman  from California CMr. FAZIO].  ",1985
1627,37,22,Mr. FAZIO., The gentleman  from  New York CMr. HORTON]  in a very bi partisan way in the conference yester day  indicated  concern  about  the  Senate version of Gramm-Rudman as  it related to Federal pay. He favored  the provision that was in the House  Democratic  alternative. Would  the  gentleman comment as to whether he  still feels that way?  ,1985
1628,37,22,Mr. HORTON.," Yes,  I will be very  happy to. The Michel proposal accept ed the proposal we presented yester day. That is, what the House conferees  presented with regard to pay. There  will be no reduction in pay. What the  gentleman is talking about is that the  proposal  that came over  from  the  Senate  to  the conference  last night  proposed that there be reductions in  pay, both for civilians and military  employees  of  the Federal Govern ment. I was and am opposed to that.  ",1985
1629,37,22,Mr. FAZIO., So the House position  would prevail on that issue?  ,1985
1630,37,22,Mr. HORTON., And that has been  cured in the Michel position.  ,1985

1636,50,22,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the Rostenkowski amend ment.  I believe that the vote we will soon take  on the Gramm-Rudman proposal will be a  watershed event in the history of this insti tution and Nation.  We are about to fundamentally alter the  way in which spending decisions are made  in the Federal Government, and in so doing  we embark on a cruise into uncharted and  dangerous  waters.  Gramm-Rudman,  in  some form, is coming, and the relationship  between  the  executive  and  legislative  branches will never be the same.  I served on the conference committee on  Gramm-Rudman. I wish every Member of  this House could have had that experience,  I think that is the only way to begin to un derstand the radical departure we are being  asked to make. In the roughly 2112 weeks  the  conference  lasted,  we  subjected  Gramm-Rudman to its first hearings-a re versal of the normal legislative process that  tells you a lot about the form in which this  proposal was  received.  Those  sessions  clearly demonstrated that precise drafting  was not the hallmark of Gramm-Rudman.  Quite simply, no one knew how it was sup posed to work. The hours that House con ferees  subsequently  spent  in  task  forces  trying  to make  sense  out  of Gramm Rudman revealed that the questions raised  by a close examination of this proposal   were of mind-numbing complexity. These  questions, some constitutional, some proce dural, and some mechanical, are not mat ters to be resolved in 3 weeks. But that was  our mandate, because of the absolute ne cessity that the debt ceiling be raised, and  the unwillingness of Gramm-Rudman's pro ponents to consider doing it in any other  way.  Your conferees were  instructed by  this  body to bring back to the House a system  by which deficits would be reduced auto matically. Many of us have serious reserva tions about the wisdom of substituting an  automatic pilot for independent judgment  on spending priorities and decisions, and  yet that substitution is  the foundation of  Gramm-Rudman. The Democratic proposal  we off er today  takes  the automatic pilot  feature of Gramm-Rudman and modifies it  to do four things:  First, take effect this year, so that the  American people can judge for themselves  whether program decimination is the only  way they want the deficit to be reduced;  Second,  insure  that  the  constitutional  issues raised by Gramm-Rudman's seques tration system can receive expeditious judi cial consideration with the knowledge that  if an element of it were found unconstitu tional, the whole process would be invali dated;  Third, guarantee that the Congressional  Budget Office would be responsible for the  reparation of the economic estimates and  reports used  to measure our compliance  with  the deficit  targets,  thereby retaining  some meaningful role for Congress in the  sequestration triggering process; and  Fourth, exempt  some programs which  serve exclusively  low-income people from  sequestration. The simple fact is, that those  programs have borne the brunt of the defi  cit reduction efforts of the  last 4 years.  They will undoubtedly bear the brunt of  similar  congressionally-initiated  budget  control efforts in the future. To hold them  open  to sequestration on top of that,  ig nores the fact that these programs provide  basic services to people who have no alter natives. I make no apologies about wanting  to exempt  food  stamps and AFDC, SSI,  Child Nutrition and similar programs from  sequestration. I thought they comprised the  safety net our president used to so warmly  embrace, and so movingly promise to main tain. We can not preserve all of the safety  net today. But let it be clearly understood  that whatever is preserved is the result of  the actions of Democrats, and not the advo cates of Gramm-Rudman.  Those four elements, it seems to me are  the minimum  necessary  to  inject  some  degree  of  rationality  into  the Gramm Rudman process.  Mr. Speaker, in my opinion the adoption  of the Gramm-Rudman concept will be an  action  this Congress will come  to deeply  regret. I know we are going to get Gramm Rudman  in some form. Under  those cir cumstances, I am going to vote for the Ros tenkowski alternative. Of the two, it better  protects the interests of this institution and  the interests of the majority of those we  represent. I only hope that the advent of  the  Gramm-Rudman  automatic  pilot  system for making spending decisions will  hasten the day when all of us; Congress,  the President, and  the American people,  will take a more honest view of the causes  of our deficit problems, and what needs to  be done to solve them.

1638,50,22,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in support of the Rostenkowski proposal  and in opposition to the Gramm-Rudman  proposal, whether  it  is  the  version  as  passed by the other body or that version re fined by  the White House and our col leagues on the other side of the aisle.  Whatever  the form, Gramm-Rudman  is  the most extensive giveaway of congres sional authority in American history. We,  as Members of Congress, should remember  that if we are to retain the power to legis late we cannot allow this power to be dilut ed. James Madison, in Federalist 58, stated  that the power of the purse represents ""the  most complete and effectual weapon with  which any Constitution can arm the imme diate representatives of the people."" Make  no mistake  about  it,  Gramm-Rudman  would dilute the Congress' power over the  purse.  Not only is Gramm-Rudman flawed con stitutionally, the basic premise is irrational  in other ways. Gramm-Rudman  ignores  20th century economic  reality. We  have  spent  the past 50 years  in  this country  trying to build mechanisms into our Gov ernment that will stabilize the economy in  times of crises. Our people have endured  painful experience in order for our Govern ment to learn the difficult lessons of eco nomic  stabilizations.  Gramm-Rudman  throws all of this out of the window.  Gramm-Rudman has no realistic provi sion to deal with recessions, regardless of  the fact that they may or may not have  been predicted. Gramm-Rudman could ac",1985

1644,76,22,Mr. GINGRICH.," I thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I think that in a lot of  ways what we are living through is, in  a sense, the last gasp of the old Demo cratic Party. It was interesting in the  other body that one of the leading lib erals in this country happened to vote  for Gramm-Rudman while the leading  advocate last year of new ideas in the  Democratic  Party  thought  that  Gramm-Rudman was too new to vote  for.  I want to really challenge the chair man of the Committee on Ways and  Means because I  think something he  said was explicitly not accurate. He  said at the beginning of his statement,  and I quote:  There is no alternative to this course of  action.  That is simply not correct. There are  many  alternatives.  The Democrats  control this House and there are many  things we  could do  this afternoon.  There are many ways we could handle  this issue. The fact is, this is the only  alternative the Democrats decided to  take.  He went on to say, and I quote:  The  future  financial  strength  of  the  Social Security System depends on this. Pl  That is simply not true. Everyone in  this body knows that at some point in  the next few months we will replenish  whatever is spent through this process  from  the General Treasury. Every body knows we are not going to let the  politicians waste  our  grandparents'  money.  The fact is that the central issue we  are arguing over is whether or not the  Democratic Party is going to allow a  straight up-or-down vote on Gramm Rudman-Mack, whether or not we are  going  to  finally move  toward really  controlling spending.  I sometimes wonder just how dumb  Democrats think the American people  are. Virtually every speaker who was  enthusiastic about the Democratic al ternative  is  somebody whose voting  record is consistently for more spend ing, with only one or two exceptions.  Again and again and again, liberal big  spenders got up and explained how  the Democratic alternative was going  to somehow improve things. The fact  is, if you would give us a straight up or-down vote on the Gramm-Rudman Mack proposal, we would not have all  these problems. The fact is, the checks  are going out on Social Security, they  are going to be honored, and what we  have today is simply another political  gimmick, another effort  to create a  smoke screen.  The question I want  to  leave you  with  is  this: What gimmick are you  going to try next week? If the other  body holds firm, if the administration  holds firm, if we do not take the ma larkey that was passed today, if we are  back in this exact same place 6 days  from  today,  then what gimmick are  you going to produce? Then what are  you going  to do? Because once  the  checks are received at home over the  weekend, once they are cashed, once  our grandparents know  they do not  have to be afraid, then the grandchil dren are going to turn and say, ""Yes.""  What is the Democratic Party, which  for 34 years has controlled the House  and created  the spending programs  that led us to this disaster now going  to do about the future of the children  and grandchildren of America? Pass  another debt limit and another debt  limit and another debt limit?  All you have done  is change from  the party of tax and spend, tax and  spend,  to  the party of borrow and  spend, borrow and spend, and I think  they know it.  ",1985

The gentleman's reference to what I  explicitly said and how he differs with  what I supposedly said has again been  checked out as to its inaccuracy. What  I  said, as opposed  to  the Congress  having no alternative, was  that the  Treasury has no alternative  to  this  course of action, and it is the Treasury  that has the fiduciary responsibility to  cover the payments of Social Security.

But the point of the debate,  Mr. President, is would we go ahead  with this program if it did not exist?

1657,115,22,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President,  I  rise  in enthusiastic support of  the  amendment  by  the  Senator  from  Rhode Island. He is absolutely right.  Get  that  figure  he  had  to  rush  through, $334,000 for each job. You  could invest that at 10 percent interest  and finance two jobs. This is only one  job that EDA can come up with at  $334,000.  Now,  I  congratulate  the Senator  from Rhode Island for offering the  amendment.  If we  cannot  cut off  money for the EDA, then we might as  well run up the white flag and surren der to the deficit. If you are looking  for waste, a purest ray serene, as the  poet who is presiding over the Senate  today might put it, then the EDA is  the real McCoy. It is  to waste and  abuse what the North Pole is to ice  and snow.  Mr. President, if we give the EDA  any more of the taxpayers' money to  waste, then shame on us. There is an  old saying, ""Fool me once, shame on  you; fool me twice, shame on me.""  EDA has  fooled us a number of  times. Let me give some examples.  Back in 1979, the EDA helped, build  a  community  center,  spending  $179,000  of  the Federal  taxpayers'  money. Mr. President, that center was  so utterly useless  that when  it col lapsed, no one noticed  it. That  is  right-it fell down, but no one noticed  that it was gone.  HUD and EDA started on this fiasco  in 1975. They paid for a building and a  road to it.  Days passed, months went by,  the  seasons  changed,  snows  fell  and  melted, and no one used the communi ty center or even knew it was there.  Finally, in 1979, a sharp-eyed woods man noticed a collapsed building, for lorn, deserted, and clothed in weeds.  Guess what?  It was  the EDA-HUD  community center. No one could tell  when it collapsed, only that it was in  ruins.  The EDA wasted a cool $179,000 on  that horror story.  Then, in 1979, the EDA approved a  $200,000 project to build a replica of  the Great Wall of China in Indiana.  That  is  right-the Great Wall  of  China. This was a big PR ploy for the  limestone industry and was paid for  with the taxpayers' money.  Hold on to your hat,  though, be cause that project was only an after thought to another limestone promo tion gambit, a proposal to build a 10story replica of the Great Pyramid  with Indiana limestone.  Tut,  tut, you might say-or even  King Tut-Tut-surely no one would  give  the OK  to  such  a wild-eyed  scheme. But you would be wrong. EDA  bought  this  one,  hook,  line,  and  sinker, and buried $500,000 of the tax payers' money in it.  Was either one ever finished? Not on  your life. All that remains of the tax payers' money  are  some  limestone  blocks sitting in an empty field.  Finally, Mr.  President,  the EDA  makes  loans,  as  the Senator  from  Rhode Island knows. Is their record  here any better? Listen to this. One  private company got a $2.5 million  loan from EDA. It used the money for  a $500,000  interest-free  loan  to  the  company's sole  stockholder.  It pur chased a fancy $300,000 helicopter for  that stockholder. It was not needed by  the company. It acquired a $65,000  lakeside cabin for that pampered, sole  stockholder.  Mr. President, I wish  these exam ples-all of which earned one of my  Golden Fleece Awards-were unusual.  They are not. As the Senator from  Rhode Island pointed out, the prob lems  at EDA  are  endemic. Giving  them a Golden Fleece is like shooting  at sitting ducks: there is no sport in it.  Someone once said that no matter  how often the human goose is plucked,  it grows a new crop of feathers. Is it  not time we made an exception to this  and stopped plucking the taxpayer?  There  is no better place  to start  than with the EDA. If there was ever  an  amendment  designed  to  show  whether we are serious about reducing  the deficit, this is it. I hope it carries  by an overwhelming vote.  I  thank  the Senator from Rhode  Island, and I yield back whatever time  I have remaining.  ",1985

1666,141,22,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I rise in support of H.R. 2965, the ap propriation bill for the Departments  of Commerce, Justice, and State, the  Judiciary, and related agencies.  This bill  is accompanied by report  language that I offered in the subcom mittee, to halt efforts to close the Na tional Weather  Service  station  in  Newark. In May, the Department of  Commerce published its intention to  close the Newark station. This month  or next, it was going to issue requests  for proposals to provide local weather  observations by private contractors.  But, Mr. President, over 75 percent  of the man-hours at the station are  dedicated to functions other than ob servations. These would have to be rethan $30,000  located,  or  simply  terminated. The  result would be  added  expenses at  other stations, or a dimution in service  to the people of New Jersey.  The airport station plays a key role  in  the area's flood warning system.  That system is critical to the health  and safety of citizens  in flood-prone  northern New Jersey. The station also  provides adaptive local forecasting, tai loring general New York forecsts  to  the particular geography, and climate  of New Jersey.  The station also provides on-the-spot  weather information for air transpor tation. There have been a disturbing  number of air  traffic accidents  this  year-many of them, weather related.  We should not risk the safety of air  travelers, by reducing our ability  to  monitor  the latest breaking weather  developments affecting air transporta tion.  Mr. President, the Department has  presented no evidence  that the con tracting out of  this  station would  result in the most efficient means of  providing essential weather service. I  am not opposed  to contracting out,  where  the private sector can accom plish the same goals more efficiently.  But, what we have here is not a case  of Government for less cost. At best,  we have a case of less Government for  less. And how much less? One unoffi cial estimate put the potential savings  at  less  a  year. That's  $30,000 a year to put the flood-prone  areas of New Jersey at risk;  to put  New Jersey air travelers' at risk; and  to deny New Jersey  locally oriented  weather service.  At worst, we have a case of less Gov ernment for greater cost, as the De partment will have to hire new people  in New York and elsewhere to pick up  some  of Newark's  functions, while  paying contractors to conduct observa tions in New Jersey.  For all these reasons, I offered and  the report includes language that di rects the Department to cease its ef forts to contract out weather observa tions at Newark, and to close down the  station. It directs the Department not  to proceed with its plan or otherwise  reorganize weather service  functions  at Newark unless it first secures the  Committee's prior approval. Last, the  language requires the Department to  supply the analysis that has been lack ing thus far on how existing weather  service  and  public  safety  functions  would be continued, what impact the  contracting out would have, and what  real cost savings would result.  Mr. President, I am pleased that the  report includes this important provi sion, preserving essential weather serv ice to northern New Jersey. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.e  e ",1985

Mr. President, I do not agree with  the suggestion of the House that we  should cease  research and valuation  effort on the measurement of noncash  benefits. However, I believe legitimate  concerns have been raised regarding  the methods used in determining the  value of inkind benefits, as well as the  extent to which specific noncash bene fits are included in the official income  data series of the Census Bureau. I be lieve  it  is  important  that, until  the  many conceptual and empirical prob lems associated with the valuation of  inkind  benefits  are  resolved,  the  Census Bureau carefully distinguish  between studies of such income and  official  income data series.  I would  also be seriously concerned about any  effort by any agency to determine pro gram  eligibility, benefit  levels,  pro gram allocations, and so forth on the  basis of such relatively untested data.  Moreover,  in carrying out Congress'  mandate  to study inkind benefits as  income, the Census Bureau should be  encouraged to obtain advice not only  from technical experts, but also from  the general scientific community,  in terested  citizens,  and  congressional  committees that care to participate.  I  believe  these views  express  the  intent of Congress in adopting Public  Law  I would welcome  the  thoughts of the distinguished subcom mittee chairman on these matters.  ",1985
1668,141,22,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr.  President,  I  cannot  contradict my  friend  from  Pennsylvania and I share many of his  concerns. I agree that it is important  to continue the research the Census  Bureau has begun. Certainly,  there  can be no objection to, and there is  much  to commend, seeking a broad  range  of  input  on  valuation  tech niques, and in broadening the kinds of  benefits that are studies.

1672,154,22,Mr. HUMPHREY., I shall be happy  to yield.  ,1985
1673,154,22,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President, I have  been one of those who, for a long time,  has been saying we ought to have im proved  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union.  I am one of  those who wel comes the summit. But my fear is, and  I guess the fear of the Senator from  New Hampshire, that because of the  summit coming up right now we do  not want to do anything that might  embarrass us or embarrass the rela tionship. The reality is  if we are to  have improved relations, we have to be  open with each other, we have to be  candid with each other. And our stand  in the area of human rights is a very  different stand from that of the Soviet  Union.  I do not know that I would agree  with  the Senator from New Hamp shire  that  this person  faces  death  when he goes back there, but I think  he faces a grim future at the very  least. I feel very uncomfortable with  the way our Nation has handled this  matter. Certainly, if the statement of  the interpreter is correct, and I have  no reason to believe that it is not cor rect, it has been very badly mishan dled.  I  hope  that  the  administration  would listen to my colleague from New  Hampshire and that somehow we can  diplomatically,  tactfully, but  firmly,  say somehow, this seaman has to have  a little bit of chance. At least for a few  weeks, let us let him stay here and see  what the situation is.  I do not know  what the full situation is. I have dis cussed briefly tonight with the chair man of the Immigration Committee's  Refugee Subcommittee, Mr. SIMPSON,  the possibility of our subcommittee  doing something. But clearly, some thing ought to be done quickly by the  administration.  I join my colleague from New Hamp shire  in urging that the administra tion, in some way-I do not know what  it is. I do not want to embarrass our selves diplomatically nor does the Sen ator  from New Hampshire. But  in  some kind of a gesture of good will, we  should try to make, we should try to  seal the fate of this seaman who has  shown unusual courage. I  thank my  colleague from New Hampshire.  It  the Senator  ",1985
1674,154,22,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  thank the Senator from Illinois. On a  few points it is clear that we broadly  agree, at  least  that  this matter de serves  examination.  is  true  that  there is fear of appearing belligerent  or  troublesome  in  advance  of  the  summit. That can be finessed, I think.  Perhaps as I have suggested to Presi dent Reagan, Mr. Medvid could be  turned over to a neutral country such  as Switzerland so there can be no ap pearance of trying to embarrass the  Soviet Union. That ought to be seen as  reasonable by both sides.  In any event, it seems to me we have  an obligation to which we are bound  by honor and decency  to open  this  case for further and more  thorough  examination, which would give  this  unfortunate man a real chance. I un derstand the man is exhausted. I un derstand he is  injured. He may well  have been drugged. The poor fellow  needs a week at least to make a rea sonable and prudent decision about  what he wants to do.  ",1985
1675,154,22,Mr.  SIMON., Would  yield?  ,1985
1676,154,22,Mr. HUMPHREY., Certainly.  ,1985
1677,154,22,Mr. SIMON.,"  I  commend my col league. I think the suggestion he has  just made that Mr. Medvid be turned  over to a neutral nation-Switerland,  Sweden, or some nation  like  that would clearly not embarrass us diplo matically. The decision does not need  to be made until next week, or we  could wait a month. But it is a way of  saying we are not just going out and  luring people away, which I am sure is  how Pravda is going to be portraying  things. The gentleman could be turned  over to a neutral nation, people in an other country can make that decision.  I think that really makes sense.  The United States and  the Soviet  Union  could  even  agree  on what  nation should do it. I think the Sena tor has made an excellent suggestion.  I hope  those  in  the administration  who monitor what is going on here, if  anybody does monitor what is going  on here, will heed the call of the Sena tor from New Hampshire.  ",1985
1678,154,22,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President, I  appreciate the remarks of the Senator  from Illinois. I urge my colleagues who  may be listening over the intercom to  phone the White House, phone Don  Regan, phone Ed Meese. Unfortunate ly, we are racing the clock. The ship  moved up river  this afternoon from  Belle Chasse  to a place  I  am  told  called Reserve, where the Soviet ship  began taking on its cargo. It takes 36  hours once it is commenced, I am told.  So the clock is running out. We cannot  afford to waste this weekend.  I simply urge my colleagues to call  the White House and beg, as I have,  that this case be reopened.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1985
1679,167,22,Mr. PACKWOOD., No; go ahead. I  want to make a point. The Senator is  doing fine.  ,1985
1680,167,22,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, the  President is going to have to look at  every one of these appropriation bills,  and see that they come in under this  particular budget. But to run pell-mell  down the road, and talk about a $50  billion sequester order means that we  did not pay any attention to the law  under the discipline, and we did not do  anything.  I can see-yes-a man of goodwill get  to $5 billion to $10 billion over, but not  $50 billion.  ",1985
1681,167,22,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, if  the Senator will yield, he is absolutely  right. Under  the provisions,  let us  assume for  round figure purposes a  total budget of $1  trillion. About one  half of it will be exempt under the  provision. We have $500 billion.  ",1985
1682,167,22,Mr. HOLLINGS., That is right.  ,1985

1686,167,22,Mr. HOLLINGS.," That is right. That  is where we will be, at best. We can  make those misjudgments, and miscal culations. We are going to make them  better. We have exceeded the budget  resolution by an average of $28 billion  and that is the average without any  discipline. We have exceeded on aver age $28 billion over the budget that we  actually predicted for 1985, 1984, 1983,  1982,  and  1981-that  is  the  track  record with no discipline.  How are you going to run over $50  billion with the discipline? The whole  idea is to make a half-truth in budget ing.  ",1985

They did  not put me on it. They put the opposi tion on-the minority. I am not whip ping them. I am tired of this nonsense  going on.  It is Friday night. We are serious  people. We have work to do.  I hope  that the House will cut out the cha rade. They know what they are doing.  They are trying to give an overload,  and sink  this. The President of the  United States would not sign  it.

1691,167,22,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield?  ",1985
1692,193,22,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  today, I am introd11cing a bill which  would amend  the Wild and Scenic  River Act of 1968, to include portions  of the Cache la Poudre River located  in north-central Colorado as part of  the national wild  and  scenic  river  system. This bill is  identical to H.R.  3547, which was  introduced  in  the  House by my colleague Congressman  HANK BROWN on October 10, 1985.  The Cache la Poudre River is a mar velously unique, free-flowing body of  water representing the largest remain ing stretch of undeveloped river in the  United States east of the Rocky Moun tains. Beginning at  the Continental  Divide  in Rocky Mountain National  Park,  the River  flows east  through  Roosevelt National Forest  and  the  Colorado cities of LaPorte, Fort Col lins, and Greeley, before  joining the  South Platt River. In 1973  the river  was one of 12 Colorado rivers author ized for Federal study for wild and  scenic designation through legislation  <Public Law 93-621) sponsored by the  1,300  late Senator Peter Dominick of Colo rado.  The Forest Service began studing  the river for wild and scenic designa tion in 1977. The draft environmental  impact statement and proposed recom mendations, covering 83 miles of the  upper reaches of the river, were issued  for public comment  in early 1980over  comments  resulted. Last  spring, the White House recommended  that 62 miles of the river be designat ed. The bill I am introducing today  would designate 75 miles.  Beginning at the  river's source at  Poudre Lake in Rocky Mountain Na tional Park,  the bill would preserve  the Cache la Poudre through the town  of Poudre Park. In honor of Senator  Dominick,  this bill would  label  the  first 18 miles of the river as the ""Peter  H. Dominick Wild River Area."" The  bill  proposes  designating  thirty-one  miles of  the river as ""wild"" and 44  miles as ""recreational"". The legislation  provides that nothing in the act would  affect  storage  and  hydroelectric  projects downstream of the designated  portions of the river, and also includes  authorization  for  land  acquisition  from willing sellers along the designat ed portions of the river. Private prop erty rights are protected by the bill,  with acquisitions of public rights-of way and scenic easements occurring  only where necessary and only when  owners wish  to sell. The  legislation  would additionally grandfather exist ing water developments to insure that  conflicts in the maintenance and man agement  of  those  projects  do  not  occur.  As Congressman BROWN said recent ly:  This legislation is the result of long nego tiations  between  the northern Colorado  water community and local and national en vironmental groups-It represents the best  spirit of compromise in terms of the long term interests of all of Northern Colorado.  The individuals involved should be proud of  their contribution to our future.  Consequently, the legislation being  introduced today is  identical to that  recommended by this group of water  and environmental interests, and I ask  that a letter from this group dated Oc tober 7, 1985, to Congressman BROWN  be  included in the RECORD  following  my statement.  It is my honor to introduce this leg islation which, I believe, will establish  the first of many wild and scenic river  designations for Colorado. I am very  pleased  that  this  compromise was  reached and commend all of the par ties involved on their spirit of coopera tion. I particularly want to commend  Congressman BROWN for his tenacity  and outstanding  leadership on  this  issue.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  51-059 0-87-7 (Pt. 22)  Hon. HANK BROWN,  U.S. House of Representatives,  Washington, DC.  DEAR HANK:  Enclosed  is  our  carefully  drafted offering of a Wild &  .Scenic River  bill for the Cache la Poudre. We hope you  will find it acceptable. As you well know, we  have spent several months  reaching  this  agreement. While we recognize it may not  be perfect, we present it to you as a state ment of our compromise and we are pledged  to support it as written.  We  appreciate your  continued  support  and encouragement. We will be available to  testify in favor of this legislation at the ear liest opportunity. We have heard that there  are currently scheduled hearings on  two  other rivers on October 22. If possible, we  would like to suggest that as a date that we  could be in Washington to  testify on the  bill.  Sincerely,  Larry D.

STUDENT CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE  PREVENTION ACT  e ",1985
1693,193,22,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  today I am  introducing the Student  Chemical Substance Abuse Prevention  Act of 1985. Ths is a straightforward  piece of legislation intended to prevent  the use of illegal drugs by our Nation's  children.  Over the past two decades, the use  of illegal drugs in the United States  has accelerated at an unprecedented  rate and has reached into every seg ment of our society. We, as adults,  seem unable to formulate an effective  campaign to reverse the trend. Howev er, after many months of discouraging  and futile efforts we are beginning to  mount an attack on the enemy called  illegal drugs. We have come to realize  that by working together we can make  a  real  difference-we  can  build  a  better future for the American public.  Mr. President, the Student Chemical  Substance Abuse Prevention Act is one  of many strategies we can use to re spond to the problem of drug abuse  which  plagues  our Nation's young  people. It is my belief that the ap proach outlined in this legislation will  prove to be one of the most effective  methods to achieve that objective.  ",1985
1694,219,22,Mr. V ANDER JAGT.," Mr. Speaker, we re cently marked the 90th anniversary of the  practice of chiropractic health care. On  September 18, 1895,  the first chiropractic  patient, Harvey Lillard, of Davenport, IA,  was examined and treated by Daniel David  Palmer, the father of chiropractic health  care. Since  that  time chiropractors have  been making  invaluable contributions  to  the physical well-being of many Americans.  I appreciate this opportunity to salute the  members of this fine profession in connec tion with this important milestone in their  history.  Those who have ever suffered with spinal  problems or back pain and have sought  chiropractic  treatment know how  impor tant their contribution to American health  care has been. This chiropratic profession  could not have survived and thrived over  the years without the courage and dedica tion of  those of  its  profession. Today,  chiropractors are licensed to practice in all  50 States and their education consists of a  total of 6 academic years following high  school graduation. In my home State of  Michigan alone there are 1,800 chiroprac tors who serve over 1.5 million patients.  I  think the outstanding work of chiro practors for the last 90 years is an excellent  example of how one group can make a sig nificant difference  in our society. Their  commitment and devotion to excellence in  health care is worthy of our highest praise.  It is with great admiration that I congratu30333  late the chiropractic doctors and their pro fessional associations on their 90th anni versary.  I am also proud, at this point, to include  in my statement an excellent letter by Dr.  Nikolas K. Dreliozis, DC, of Muskegon, Ml,  the largest city in our ninth congressional  district, which appeared in the Muskegon  Chronicle. Dr. Dreliozis presented very in teresting information on this special 90th  anniversary. His letter follows:  CHIROPRACTIC CELEBRATES 90TH  ANNIVERSARY  Chiropractic is 90 years old this month,  but the benefits of chiropractic were fore seen before the turn of the century.  Although chiropractic was in its infancy  at the time, having been founded in 1895,  Thomas Edison saw its method as a dynamic  new approach to healing. When you consid er the fact that spinal adjustment was a  new concept and the world had a tendency  to be prejudice against anything new and  different, you realize it took men of great  scientific mind to understand the benefits of  normal nerve functions.  Thomas Edison predicted chiropractic's  role in the healing arts when he said, ""The  doctor of the future will give no medicine,  but will interest his patients in the care of  human frame ... and in the cause and pre vention of disease.""  Over 90 years ago, when the first chiro practic adjustment was made, the average  male's life expectancy was 44 years. Today  it is 73 years.  With strides being made in health care,  thanks to research and technology, our av erage  life span will be greatly expanded.  Indeed, it is probable that within the next  75 years the average male can look forward  to living to be 100 years old.  Despite optimism toward the healing pro fession's ability to lengthen the individual's  life span, I am concerned over mass ""kill ing"" factors.  Our society is faced with several counter acting dangers which must be corrected if  we are able to enjoy the benefits of modem  scientific advances. We must do away with  the poisons of air pollution, water pollution  and body pollution.  Body pollution which  results  from  the  careless intake of drugs and medications is  as great a hazard to human life as air and  water pollution. The chiropractic profession  does not depend on drugs for treatment.  Thousands  of  doctors  of  chiropractic  throughout the world are using this 90th  anniversary year to rededicate  themselves  to the health needs of humankind. I urge  the public to pay more attention to their  health and seek the benefits of advance ments made in health technology.  MR. PRESIDENT, NO ARMS TO  JORDAN  HON. H. JAMES SAXTON  OP NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 1, 1985  ",1985
1695,219,22,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker,  there has  been much discussion in this body and in  the media about the President's decision to  pursue strategic arms sales to Jordan.  I  have  joined many Members of  the  House in expressing our opposition to this  ",1985
1696,232,22,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, next year will  mark the 350th anniversary of the U.S. Na tional Guard, an organization of citizen soldiers whose members have defended this  country since before its  independence. To  honor this remarkable record of service, I  recently cosponsored a resolution (H. Res.  245), introduced by Representative THOMAS  HARTNETT, of South Carolina, which would  call upon the Postmaster General to issue a  commemorative stamp  to honor  the Na tional Guard.  The National Guard was organized  in  Boston in 1636 as a local militia. Later, of  course,  the Guard defended  the colonists  against  the British during  the American  Revolution, and has fought  in every war,  and  almost  every  battle,  since. But  al though I support this effort to celebrate the  National Guard's anniversary,  I am sure  my colleagues agree, it is insufficient honor  to mark such an illustrious history.  We in Illinois can share in our Nation's  pride on the Natonal Guard's anniversary,  for  the  Illinois National Guard  is very  nearly as old.  It also boasts  two former  Presidents of the United States among its  ranks.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The Illinois National Guard was born in  1712 as the Provincial Militia of the Illinois  District of the Province of Louisiana, when  the territory still belonged to the French. It  was organized by Pierre Duque Boisbriant  in Cahokia and Kaskaskia. Territorial mili tiamen joined the fight against the British  in the Revolution, and our State National  Guard has served in every American con flict since.  The Illinois Military and Naval Depart ment, which comprises the Illinois National  Guard, has published a fascinating account  of the National Guard careers of two of our  State's most famous citizens, Abraham Lin coln and Ulysses Grant. A pamphlet au thored by Dr. Wayne C. Temple highlights  the contributions they made through their  service in the Guard.  Abraham Lincoln and a  group of his  friends answered  the Governor's call  for  volunteers to fight in the Black Hawk War,  and Lincoln was appointed captain of his  rag-tag regiment near Pleasant Plains, IL,  on April 21, 1832. The regiment immediate ly set off for Beardstown, but their planned  encounter with the Indians never material ized. In fact,  later in his career, Lincoln  joked that mosquitoes caused his only loss  of blood in the Black Hawk campaign.  Although Lincoln remained a member of  the Illinois National Guard for the rest of  his  life, his next promotion, according to  Dr. Temple, came on March 4, 1861, when  he became President and Commander-in Chief of the entire U.S. Army Forces. Cer tainly, that was the biggest promotion in  U.S. history.  Ulysses Grant  began  his  service  in  Springfield, at  the outbreak of the Civil  War. Gov. Richard Yates, impressed by the  fact that Grant had attended West Point,  made Grant his military aide and gave him  a desk job in the adjutant general's office.  Grant, however, wanted to see combat, and  in June 1861, Governor Yates gave Grant  his commission, as colonel of 21st Infantry  Regiment  of  the  Illinois State Militia.  Grant proved himself well, and rose quick ly through the ranks. He was promoted to  brigadier general  later  in 1861, and  took  command of the entire Union Army  less  than 3 years  later. Surprisingly,  though,  Grant was not made a  full general until  1866-after the Civil War had ended.  In  1869, he too became President of the United  States and Commander-in-Chief.  Today, the Illinois National Guard is at  the disposal of the Governor and the Presi dent, and helps to maintain order in time  of storm, public disorder, or other emer gency. The State spends about $4 million  annually for the National Guard, while the  Federal Government contributes more than  $52 million. Men and women between the  ages of 17 and 35 are eligible to join, and  serve one weekend each month and 2 weeks  each year.  The National Guard also offers a full col lege scholarship and job training to high  school students, age 17 and older. Students  are eligible in their junior year, and can re ceive  immediate  pay  and  training  one  weekend  per month while  they  finish  school. Upon  graduation,  they  continue  November 1, 1985  weekend service, but also can receive a full  4-year scholarship to any Illinois State-run  college or university.  The National Guard provides an excellent  opportunity for national service, and repre sents  the highest  ideal of the citizen-sol dier.  HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SOVIET  UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE  HON. JACK F. KEMP  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 30, 1985  ",1985
1697,232,22,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, first of all,  would  like to thank my good friend and  colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey,  JIM COURTER, for giving us this opportuni ty  to  focus attention on  the continuing  human rights violations taking place in the  Soviet Union. The  timing  is crucial; our  representatives are presently meeting at the  cultural forum in Budapest with the repre sentatives of the other 34 countries who  signed the Helsinki Final Act, and we are  on the threshold of the meeting in Geneva  between  President Reagan  and General  Secretary Gorbachev. We have also recent ly heard encouraging news about the possi bility of a 3-month exit visa for Dr. Elena  Bonner for medical treatment.  I interpret the news about Dr. Bonner as  a possible sign that perhaps the Soviets do  not wish to appear as intransigent as they  have in the past. However, I think we, as a  people, must be careful not to be taken in  by Gorbachev's apparent charm,  facility  with words, and ability  to deal with  the  press. The Soviets finally have someone in  power who knows the value of good public  relations but we cannot let an affable de meanor and a Western attitude toward the  press cloud the real issues. We need to see  real progress in the area of human rights  before we can even think about any agree ment.  This is why linkage is so important. Any  agreement we enter into with the Soviets  must be predicated on a prior and concur rent condition of tangible human rights ef forts. Dr. Bonner's exit visa may appear to  be a kind act, but it is no more than what  any  civilized  country would  have done  years ago. I must also point out that this is  only one visa, and there are hundreds of  thousands waiting to  leave. Dr. Bonner's  visa is only temporary, and even if it were  permanent, it would be valueless without a  corresponding exit permit for her husband,  Dr. Andrei Sakharov. And one for Anatoly  Shcharansky and one for Ida Nudel and  one for Josef Begun and one for Vladimir  Volvovsky and one for each of the hun dreds of thousands of refuseniks and pris oners of conscience, Christian and Jewish  and any other ethnic or religious minority.  And one  for each  individual who would  wish to leave but feared the reprisals of a  punitive and repressive system.  ",1985
1698,245,22,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to  submit  for my colleagues' review ex cerpts  from  an  article  published  last  Sunday in The New York Times Magazine.  ""The World Ahead: Black Parents Prepare  Their Children For Pride and Prejudice""  examines black parents and their changing  responsibilities as  teachers of racial and  ethnic identity. It also describes the current  attitudes of black youth and their level of  awareness of racial discrimination.  The article was of particular interest to  me,  since  it  f ea tu res  two of my  good  friends, Dr. Deborah Prothrow, formerly of  Houston and her husband, Rev. Charles R.  Stith, with  their  three children. The ex periences  they  relate as a  contemporary  black family were most informative.  I  urge my  colleagues  to  read  this  thoughtful article.  It provides  invaluable  insight into a little discussed problem.  The article follows:  CFrom the New York Times Magazine, Oct.  27, 1985]  THE WORLD AHEAD; BLACK PARENTS PREPARE  THEIR CHILDREN FOR PRmE AND PllEJuDICE  <By Thomas Morgan>  The memory of the motel sign is still vivid  despite the years. Neatly printed black let ters on white spelled a puzzling message for  a young black boy from suburban St. Louis  traveling with his parents through sleepy  Arkansas  towns with the rural charm of  Norman Rockwell paintings.  The sign read ""Whites Only."" When the  boy asked about it, his mother answered re signedly, ""It means we can't stay  there,  son.""  Nearly 30 years have passed since I saw  that sign and pondered its message. I have  grown and prospered because my father, a  postal employee, and my mother, a public school teacher, sent me, like Moses through  the bulrushes, to the shores of new opportu nity created by the civil-rights movement. I  was one of two blacks to integrate a subur ban elementary school  in 1958. Later, a  White ninth-grade English teacher encour aged me to become a journalist because she  saw a spark of writing talent.  After college,  I  served as an Air Force  Lieutenant and White House military social  aide under President Ford, which allowed  me, in a position other than that of a serv ant, to see the gracious pomp and ceremony  surrounding the First Family. In the late  1960's and early 70's, with the implementa tion of affirmative-action programs, I was  among those blacks who found entry-level  jobs in professions that, for the most part,  had been closed to our parents.  Despite  the advances  race  relations  that my life may exemplify and my close  friendships with several whites, I cannot in  good conscience tell a young black child he  can succeed by merit alone. Nor could I tell  a black child to expect, in general, the same  opportunities as whites, because prejudice,  though waning, lingers.  I still see the sign, ""Whites Only,"" but it is  not hanging  from some Southern motel.  The words ""Whites Only"" come  to mind  when I go as a journalist to cocktail parties  and other events where crucial contacts and  decisions are being made and I am the only  black not serving the hors d'oeuvres. I see  the sign when  I hear racially  insensitive  comments by white acquaintances who pro fess a knowledge of black culture, love the  60's and the Motown sound and reject the  idea of discrimination, but who have no real  black friends or who do not socialized with  blacks outside professional settings.  It is  an  enigma  to me,  a  34-year-old  middle-class black man, because although I  have benefited  from civil-rights advances  and better relationships with whites than  my parents, the reality I see from my own  experiences, and one that is supported by  recent surveys and polls, is that America rein  ",1985

1700,258,22,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, I have no  further requests for time.  I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I would like to say that, in  passing these memorials, what we at tempted to do is get a bipartisan spirit  behind it so that we did not have any  internal conflicts about it, and that is  why we did  reach conclusions  that  may not have been what my friend,  the  gentleman  from Virignia  [Mr.  PARRIS] who did  introduce a bill, a  very worthy bill as well, was disap pointed in; and frankly, I do not have  a problem with it on a personal level  in using taxpayers money for this, but  I do think it is important to have a bi partisan spirit.  At this time, I yield to the distin guished chairman of  the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.  ",1985
1701,258,22,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," I  gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I basically supported  what  the  gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr. PARRIS] was doing as well as the  Florio bill.  What we were trying to do was to  proceed to build the monument with  appropriated funds  in order to avoid  some of the problems that happened  in the building of the Vietnam Memo rial. That is why our bill authorized $5  million for the construction of the me morial.  The Vietnam Memorial was built  from volunteer donations. As I recall  more  than $9 million were  raised.  About $2.5 million was spent for fund raising; only about $3.8 million really  went into the construction of the me morial. We included a provision in the  bill  allowing  the American Battle  Monuments  Commission  to  accept  contributions from the general public  and  those  contributions  could  be  offset against the $5 million authoriza tion contained in the legislation; many  people of this country would like to  give to the memorial and be part of it.  That was the reason we authorized  the $5 million, but the committee felt  differently, and we certainly support  what is before the House now.  thank the  ",1985
1702,258,22,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may use.  One reason  to avoid any question  about how the funds are being used  and so on, one reason that the legisla tion is very specific about the Ameri can Battle Monuments Commission in  collecting these funds  is  to dissuade  any conflicts relative to the collecting  of  the funds;  that  if everyone who  wants to give can give to the central  commission that has a very fine repu tation; it is in fact under the jurisdic tion of  the distinguished Veterans'  Committee, that will avoid any kind of  problem  in  the  correction  of  the  funds. Is that not correct?  ",1985
1703,258,22,Mr. MONTGOMERY.," If the gentle woman will yield, that is exactly right,  and that is why we recommend that  the Battlefield Monuments Commis sion be involved; the great reputation  it has, the tremendous job it has done  around the world on cemeteries and  memorials, and we felt  this was  the  proper way to go.  As I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, what  the committee has done is satisfactory  and we need to move ahead.  ",1985
1704,258,22,Ms. OAKAR.," I thank the gentleman  and all the people who sponsored the  legislation, and at this time I have no  further requests for time.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1985
1705,258,22,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 1 additional minute.  Mr. Speaker, there was controversy  on how this monument was to be fi nanced, and the gentleman from Vir ginia [Mr. PARRIS], and aided by the  gentleman from Mississippi, the distin guished chairman of the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs  [Mr. MONTGOM ERY] and the distinguished gentleman  from Arkansas [Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT]  were  very  strong  in  requesting  a  monument to be paid for by the tax payers.  The committee opted instead for the  traditional method by which other me morials had been erected in Washing ton on Federal property; I st111 stand  by that. I would agree with all of the  people who have spoken that it is most  important that we move ahead rather  than exactly how I hope the alterna tive of allowing the Battlefield Monu ments  Commission  to  accept  the  money will prevent people from giving  money which is used up in, with exces sive fundraising costs, and I hope that  the memorial w111 be a fine one that  Americans will be proud of for many  years into the future.  I  hope  the bill w111  passed.  be promptly  ",1985
1706,258,22,Mr. MOLINARI.," Mr. Speaker,  I am a  strong supporter of H.R. 2205,  legislation  which will authorize the construction of a  memorial to honor those American Armed  Forces who served  in  the Korean war. I  was pleased  to be an early cosponsor of  this bill and to submit testimony before the  Task Force on Libraries and Memorials  when a hearing was conducted on this bill  on July 10, 1985.  I have been concerned  about this  issue for a  long time and am  pleased that the House is considering this  bill today.  As one walks about Washington with its  many war memorials and monuments,  it  soon becomes obvious  that something  is  missing-a fitting  tribute  to our Korean  war dead and those who served in that con flict. More than 30 years have passed since  the end of the Korean war and we should,  as a nation, express our appreciation and  gratitude to the Americans who served in  Korea and memorialize  the loss of those  who never  returned. A memorial  to our  servicemen who  fought so bravely under  severe personal hardships is long overdue.  Having served in Korea myself, I saw first hand many  examples  of  extraordinary  courage and sacrifice by my fellow Ameri cans.  When the North Korean Army attacked  across the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950,  with 100,000 troops armed and trained by  the Soviet Union, America and many of our  allies responded to the crisis. Three years  later, with both sides claiming victory, a  peace agreement was signed. However, the  price we paid for that peace was high. In  those few years, 54,246 Americans lost their  lives, 4,600 were  taken prisoner and over  103,000 were wounded. Approximately 5  million American veterans were involved in  that war, a war about which most Ameri cans, unfortunately, quickly became apa thetic.  This memorial  is a deserving one and  will serve to show that we fully recognize,  and will not forget, the contribution of our  Korean veterans. I believe that this legisla tion will provide the proper means of fund ing, site selection, and design  to erect a  proper memorial and  I urge passage of  H.R. 2205 today.  ",1985
1707,258,22,Mr. KINDNESS.," Mr. Speaker, as a co sponsor of H.R. 2205, to authorize a memo rial in the District of Columbia to honor  those Americans who served this country  so proudly and well in the Korean war, I  wanted to express my support for the pas sage of this legislation today.  That we have yet to honor those brave  Americans who over 30 years ago traveled  thousands of miles  from our shores  to  defend  freedom and  to deter Communist  aggresion  is regrettable. Our Korean war  veterans,  including over 54,000 who  lost  their lives in this war, deserve to be hon ored, and I am pleased to have been a part  of this effort to recognize those veterans  with a Korean war memorial.  There are no costs associated with  the  passage of this legislation. Over 30 years  have passed without suitable recognition,  and it seems that authorizing construction  of a Korean war memorial is most appro priate. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  ",1985
1708,258,22,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in support of H.R. 2205,  the Korean  War Memorial Act.  This is legislation I have cosponsored to  honor the more than 5 million Americans  ",1985

1713,284,22,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, the  odyssey on the farm bill here on the  Senate floor merits a clear recording  of the matters that are considered in it  and the matters that interfere with its  consideration.  On Friday, October 25, a number of  amendments were accepted. This was  really the first day of actual debate.  Some amendments were voted upon  but were also easily accepted on a  voice  vote  concerning  the  amend ments. That took up Friday.  Then on Monday, we started a pro cedure of laying down cargo pref er ence  amendments  and  considering  them.  By  unanimous  consent,  on  Wednesday, October  30,  the  cargo  preference  amendments  were  laid  aside and the Lugar amendment was  taken up. The Lugar amendment was  simply  to modify  the bill  to have  target prices at the current levels for  only 1 year, the so-called 1-year freeze  on target prices. We voted on that at  5:20 on that date, last Wednesday, and  the proposed amendment was def eat ed, which put us right back on cargo  preference.  The balance of that day was taken  up by  considering whether or not  other amendments would be brought  up. When we were  taken out and  brought back on Thursday, October  31, we were brought back on to the  farm bill at 7:36 p.m. with a motion by  the majority leader to recommit the  bill and adding two of his amendments  to that motion of recommittal. We fin ished out the Halloween evening with  a reading of the amendment, not all of  it was read, a portion of it was read,  and we adjourned.  Friday morning, we went  to  the  State, Justice, Commerce appropria tions bill and we were on it until 3:04  p.m., when we went back on to the  farm bill. At 3:21, just a few minutes  later, 17 minutes later, the majority  leader made a motion to table his own  amendment, and  the  tabling motion  did not prevail. After that vote was  completed, at 3:51 p.m., we went off  the bill and we are still not back on it.  It should be made clear  that  the  reason we are not on it is that the  pending business before us is the debt  ceiling bill with the Gramm-Rudman Hollings amendment attached  to  it.  Under the &greement which was en tered into by unanimous consent, we  would be on that until several amend ments are disposed of and final pas sage is voted, sometime, presumably,  on Wednesday evening.  So  if we are going  to have much  debate on the farm bill, I guess it is  going to be during the morning hour,  because there is no opportunity, in the  position we are in, for getting back to  the farm b111 without regular order  being called for, and I would not an ticipate that any of us would want to  call for regular order since it is clear,  under  the unanimous-consent agree ment, that we are determined to dis pose  of  the  debt  ceiling  and  the  Gramm-Rudman provision.  The  pending  amendment,  in  the  form of a motion for recommittal with  two of the Dole amendments attached  to it, should be properly understood  by the Senate. First of all, the Dole  amendment calls for a 1-year target  price freeze for feedgrains, cotton, and  rice.  For wheat, there is a different deal.  It is called the flexible parity concept.  The wheat farmers, in return for set ting various amounts of  land aside,  would  receive  deficiency  payments  from the Treasury for the wheat pro duced on the remaining part of their  farms. This  special wheat program  works this way: for instance, for set ting aside 25 percent of the land, the  wheat  farmer would have a  target  price of $4.60 for the 1986 crop, and  $4.35 for the target price for the suc ceeding year's crops.  What is the advantage to the wheat  farmer? The wheat farmers of a par ticular size, depending upon their acre age and their production, might be in  favor of this program,  this so-called  flexible parity for wheat.  For  instance,  if  the acreage were  quite  large you could have a  target  price of $5.50,  substantially higher  than that contemplated by any bill for  your production by setting aside 40  percent of your acreage.  Forty percent of the acreage of a  small farm might look like some sort  of targeting procedure to help a small  wheat farmer.  I do not  think most  larger farmers will think it is targeted  for small wheat farmers. I think they  are going to believe it is targeted for  them because  they would set aside  whatever fits their case. If they can  make more money on the deficiency  payments by setting aside 40 percent,  they will go for the $5.50. However, if  they make more money by  setting  aside only 15 percent of their land and  make more money getting a  $4.20  target price they will pencil it out and  make their own choice.  The National Association of Wheat  Growers  has  reviewed  the  flexible  parity concept for wheat a number of  times. They  tell me  that  they still  reject it and reject it rather vigorously  because they believe that there must  be some supply control and that if we  are going to target the program for  the smaller producers we ought to go  at it in a different way. That is what  we did in the Senate Agriculture Com mittee, we did target it for the smaller  producers with the Boren amendment  which allows for the slightly higher  target  price  for  production  up  to  20,000 bushels and then reduces it for  production over that. That is calculat ed to assist the small wheat producers  ",1985
1714,323,22,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to report that the Jerusa lem Fellowships Program held its first  reunion meeting on Monday, Novem ber 4, in New York City. The Jerusa lem  Fellowships  Program  brought  over 100 North American college and  graduate students to Israel this past  summer. My distinguished colleague  from  Pennsylvania, ARLEN  SPECTER,  and I had the privilege of serving as  honorary chairmen of  the advisory  committee that selected these fellow ship recipients from over 1,000 worthy  applicants.  The  Jerusalem  Fellows  spent  6  weeks touring and studying in Israel.  Their first night in Israel was celebrat ed with a gala private reception given  by President and Mrs. Herzog at their  Jerusalem residence. During the weeks  that followed,  they met  individually  with Prime Minister Shimon Peres,  Defense Minister Yitzchak  Rabin,  former  Defense  Ministers  Moshe  Arens, Ariel Sharon, and Ezer Weiz man, and half a dozen other leading  Knesset members including former Is raeli Army Chief of Staff Raphael  Eitan; the first Israeli Ambassador to  Egypt,  Eliahu Elissar; Minister  of  Health Mordecai Gur; Deputy Foreign  Minister Roni Milo, and Interior Min ister Yitzchak Peretz. In almost every  case, there was an opportunity for in depth dialog with these individuals an unprecedented opportunity for a  study mission for college-age students  to question Cabinet Ministers. In addi tion, the fellows met with Israeli citi zens from every walk of life and from  every group in that diverse society.  Eighty of  the hundred Jerusalem  Fellows  had  never  been  in  Israel  before. They had been selected on the  basis  of  intellectual and  leadership  skills and I am confident that they  will articulate the insights developed  during this tour now that they have  returned to their campuses  through out North America.  The Jerusalem Fellowships Program  was sponsored by Aish HaTorah Ye shiva  in Jerusalem, a unique educa tional  institution headed by Rabbi  Noach Weinberg, a leading contempo rary Jewish philosopher and educator.  The program's executive director was  Rabbi Philip Shore. The chairman of  the  advisory  committee  is Richard  Horowitz of Los Angeles, president of  the North American Board of Gover nors  of  Eish  HaTorah-Jerusalem.  Members of  the advisory committee  who interviewed and selected the fel lows and helped develop their itiner ary include New York State Supreme  Court  Justice Miryam Altman;  the  chairman  of  the New York State  Board  of Regents, Martin Barrell;  former U.S. Assistant Attorney Gener al Alice Daniel; former chairman of  the New York City Board of Higher  Education, Dr. Harold  Jacobs; New  York attorney and communal leader,  Lydia Kess;  the president of Touro  College, Dr. Bernard Lander; and a  distinguished Member of the House of  Representatives, Congressman HENRY  A. WAXMAN of California.  It is obvious from the response to  this summer's program that the Jeru salem fellowships has made a signifi cant contribution  toward  furthering  understanding of Israel among North  American young people.  I  salute all  who were involved in this magnificent  project.e  SOVIET ARMS CONTROL AD IN  THE WASHINGTON POST  e Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise  today to call to the attention of my  colleagues a situation described  in a  short article which appeared on the  front page of last Friday's Wall Street  Journal. The article reads as follows:  No sale: The Soviets buy a full-page Wash ington Post ad for an arms-control article by  the chief of  their armed  forces general  staff-but rebuff a U.S. feeler to buy space  in Soviet papers to argue the American posi tion. The Russians say their papers don't  take ads. Says a U.S. official: ""They said,  'We play by your rules, and we expect you  to play by ours.' ""  As  is  usually  the  case with  the  Soviet Union, they are able to formu late superficially plausible arguments  in support of the most absurd proposi tions. It certainly sounds fair that if  they are willing to play by our rules in  our country, then we should be willing  to play by their rules in their country.  Such an equation would be fair  if  the rules were fair and if the results  were fair. Such an equation presumes  a moral symmetry or equivalence be tween the rules of our two systems, a  symmetry or equivalence which does  not exist. The problem is that their  closed rules serve their purposes, and  they exploit our open rules to serve  their purposes.  Let us talk about what's really going  on here. Their purpose is to advocate a  clearly one-sided arms control propos al-theirs-which,  if accepted, would  constitute a ratification of permanent  Soviet  strategic  superiority. Such  a  result would be a death blow to this  Republic and to freedom in the world  as a whole.  Moreover,  their  advocacy  takes  direct  advantage of our  freedoms freedoms they deny their own people.  Our Constitution guarantees freedom  of the press. One of the major pur poses of this freedom is to allow our  people-who are the masters of their  Government-to hear all sides of an  issue so that they can formulate fully  considered opinions and exercise their  right to vote intelligently.  Fortunately, because of  this  free dom, our people are used to exposure  to lively public debate on all political  issues-including  those  that bear di rectly  upon  our  national  security.  They  know  the  facts. They  know  where the parties stand. They are able  to make up their own minds.  One of the major causes of our com petition and conflict with the Soviet  Union  is  that the Soviet rules deny  their own people exposure  to unap proved ideas, the right to discuss them  in public, and the right to participate  in their own Government to express  their views on political  issues.  In a  fundamental sense, the Soviet Govern ment cannot be considered the legiti mate  representative  of  the  Soviet  people.  Their leaders know they hold power  by virtue of the efforts of the KGB  and the Red army, not by virtue of the  consent of the governed. This is why  their rules are different. In the Soviet  Union, the expression of ideas which  do not represent the party line is ex plosively dangerous-dangerous to the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union's dominant  role  and  to  the  power and privileges of its leaders.

1716,349,22,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 6, the Water  Resources Conservation, Development,  and Infrastructure Improvement and  Rehabilitation Act of 1985.  H.R. 6 is a  tribute to the full com mittee  chairman,  JIM HOWARD,  the  subcommittee chairman, BoB RoE, and  the  subcommittee  ranking minority  member,  ARLAN  STANGELAND.  These  men,  and many others, have  spent  days and nights over the course of 3  years on  this comprehensive, crucial  legislation.  Their  indepth  analysis  argues  for  the strong support I am  confident H.R. 6 will receive.  The bill before us today is truly a  landmark bill. For example, it takes a  major step in forming a nationally co ordinated water use policy. It also in tegrates, for the first time, the author ization  and  deauthorization  of  all  types of water resource projects with  the establishment of an equitable new  Federal/non-Federal partnership-in cluding  cost-sharing  requirements  where appropriate. H.R. 6 embodies  the belief that Congress can indeed de velop a nationally coordinated policy  that will  ensure maximum benefits  from one of our most vital national  assets-our water resources.  It has been far  too  long since we  have enacted a comprehensive water  resources bill. The  last omnibus bill  became law in 1976, and the last major  water resources construction authori zation law dates back to 1970-15 years  ago. During this period, our water re sources infrastructure has deteriorat ed to the point where it is now in criti cal need of repair, rehabilitation and  improvement. In addition, because no  new projects have been authorized, a  large backlog of proposed water  re source initiatives has accumulated.  Our bill is a bold and innovative at tempt to address these increasing con cerns. The size and scope of H.R. 6  represents over a decade of detailed  planning and study of national water  resource problems. The bill makes nu merous changes in the current water  resources program to respond to new  priorities and the needs of this diverse  Nation. At the same time, it balances  the need for new policies, including in creased non-Fedtral cost-sharing, with  sensitivlty for existing economic condi tions  and  important  environmental  values.  H.R.  6  provides  a  framework  for  strengthening our water resources in frastructure. It authorizes studies for  potential water  resources  projects,  modification of  authorized projects,  and construction of new projects for  the Army Corps of Engineers. Projects  authorized in the bill will strengthen  local, regional, and national economies  and encourage increased trade, which  can improve our balance of payments.  The bill contains programs for assist ance to communities for the construc tion,  repair,  and  rehabilitation  of  water supply systems and for protec tion from flooding and erosion. H.R. 6  also establishes a National Board on  Water Policy to provide a nationwide  source of professional expertise and  cooperation  between Federal, State  and local entities.  In  addition,  the bill  deauthorizes  many older water resources develop ment projects which have not been  constructed and which are no longer  necessary.  At the same time, this is a strong en vironmental bill. It creates a $35 mil lion Environmental Protection Mitiga tion Fund and an Office of Environ mental Policy within the Corps of En gineers  to  formulate and carry out  corps' policy on environmental quality.  Mr. Chairman, allow me to highlight  some of the main features of H.R. 6.  Title I deals with port development. In  addition to authorizing numerous port  projects throughout the country, this  title establishes a $1  billion a year  fund to help finance construction, op eration and maintenance of port and  harbor  improvement  projects.  The  fund would be financed, in part, from  a 0.04 percent ad valorem tax to be  levied on imports and exports which is  expected  to  generate between $150  million and $200 million per year in  new revenues.  The cost-sharing provisions in title I,  so crucial to the continued vitality of  our Nation's harbors,  largely  reflect  the  recent  compromise  reached be tween Senate leaders and the adminis tration. The non-Federal share of con struction costs for port improvement  projects with depths of 14 to 20 feet  would be 10 percent  in cash during  construction, 25 percent for projects  with depths between 20 and 45  feet,  ",1985

1719,362,22,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Chairman,  rise in strong support of the bill.  I  know  that  communities  across  America have a keen interest in this  measure, and that also includes Jeffer son County, AL. Jefferson County and  the city of Birmingham which I repre sent have been plagued for decades by  flooding around what is called Village  Creek.  Mr. Chairman, as this committee bill  so ably recognizes, when it rains hard,  Village Creek becomes a raging river  that floods  the  residences and busi nesses located by the sides of it. This  flooding has become not only frequent  but deadly since the 1940's. I spoke to  a man in one part of my district, in the  Ensley neighborhood, who has seen  flood waters rise over the top of his  chain-link  fence  and  neighborhood  dumpsters wash away. And in 1965 a  young man was drowned when  the  creek became a river and rushed down  his neighborhood. By the end of the  1970's the Army Corps of Engineers  estimated that flooding around Village  Creek  resulted  in  annual  property  damages of over $2. 7 million.  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that our  cities alone cannot handle the problem  of severe flooding,  even  though  the  city of Birmingham by itself has spent  $2.5 million beginning in 1930 and has  spent millions of dollars since  then.  This bill addresses this important and  urgent need, and I wholeheartedly en dorse the measure and urge its adop tion.  ",1985
1720,362,22,Mr. HOW ARD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California [Mr. MILLER], a member of  the Committee on Interior and Insular  Affairs.  ",1985
1721,362,22,Mr. MILLER  of  California.," Mr.  Chairman, I appreciate the opportuni ty to address the issues raised by con sideration  of H.R.  6,  the  omnibus  Corps  of Engineers water  resource  project authorization bill.  This legislation contains many provi sions of direct interest to those of us  concerned with water resources devel opment matters in the western United  States. Indeed, many provisions in this  bill as it was introduced, amended or  revised statutes under the jurisdiction  of the Committee on Interior and In sular Affairs. As chairman of the Sub committee on Water and Power Re sources, I was concerned by this effort  to revise these laws.  Accordingly,  Chairman  UDALL  re quested sequential ref err al of H.R. 6  because  the bill, as reported by  the  Public Works Committee, contained a  number  of  provisions  rev1smg  or  amending  Interior Committee  stat utes. The Speaker granted this request  and  the  Interior Committee consid ered H.R. 6 on September 11, 1985.  The Interior Committee recommended  several significant changes in the bill  which I would like to discuss today.  One important change requires that  non-Federal  interests  contribute  at  least 50 percent of the cost of feasibili ty studies for Bureau of Reclamation  projects. this is currently the Interior  Department's policy, but on too many  occasions, the policy has been ignored.  We  believe  this  is  a  significant  :reform because it will  insure greater  consistency between the planning pro grams of the corps and the Bureau. It  will also insure that non-Federal enti ties pay a fair share of the cost of f ea sibility studies in a timely manner.  The  Interior Committee  also  ap proved amendments which require fur ther  congressional  action  for  any  interstate  compacts  or  agreements.  H.R. 6, as reported, would have given  the consent of the Congress for  the  States of  Illinois,  Iowa, Minnesota,  Missouri, and Wisconsin to enter into  agreements dealing with comprehen sive planning of the Upper Mississippi  River.  The  Interior  Committee  amend ments would authorize these States to  enter into negotiations for an  inter state water  compact or  agreement.  Any agreement or compact developed  by the States would become final only  after ratification by an act of Con gress.  The committee believes it is inappro priate for the Congress to give prior  consent to any interstate water com pact or agreement without full knowl edge of the contents of the agreement.  Agreements or compacts should be ap proved only after they have been sub mitted to the Congress as required by  the Constitution.  The  rpost  important  amendments  approved by  the Interior Committee  were those recommending deletion of  title XII from H.R. 6.  Title XII would make two important  changes in existing law. First, it would  establish a National Board on Water  Resources Policy to coordinate Feder al water  resources policies and pro grams, and undertake planning stud ies. The Board would also establish, by  rule, principles, standards, and proce dures for the formulation and evalua tion of Federal water projects.  Second,  the Board would make  grants to States to assist in water re sources planning. A total of $100 mil lion is authorized to be appropriated  for fiscal years 1986 through 1990 for  these planning assistance grants.  I appreciate the efforts of the Public  Works Committee to fashion a bill to  gain the strong support of those inter ested  in  reforming water  resources  policy. I understand why they includ ed the Board and the State grant pro gram in H.R. 6. However, I do not be lieve either of these proposals merit  enactment at this time.  I believe it is important to provide  some background on  the  issue of a  water policy Board. The Water Re sources Council  [WRCl was  estab lished in 1965 to serve as a focal point  for Federal  activities  on water  re sources policy. For over 15 years, the  Council served as a  forum  through  which water resource issues could be  discussed, greater consistency devel oped, and liaison with the States could  take place.  However, in 1981, the administration  terminated funding for the Council, as  well as for the six river basin commis sions which also were established in  1965. At the same time, the principles  and standards for planning projects,  which had been implemented as rules  in 1979, were revised and reissued as  guidelines. Moreover,  authorization  and appropriations for the State grant  program were not extended.  Thus,  the administration and  the  Congress have  chosen not  to  fund  either  the existing Water Resources  Council or the State grants. I have not  received any indication from the ad ministration that they have changed  their minds on funding this new Na tional Water Resources Policy Board  or $100 million in State grants.  Moreover, I doubt whether creating  another agency of  the Federal Gov ernment will, in fact, lead to genuine  water  resource  policy  reform. The  Water Resources Council was created  to  provide  leadership  and  improve ment in Federal water resources activi ties. However, the Council was ineffec tive in implementing reforms and pro viding  leadership on such  issues  as  eliminating  uneconomic  projects,  tightening project evaluation criteria,  reducing  Federal  expenditures  on  water projects, and promoting less ex pensive and environmentally damag ing solutions to water problems. The  cosmetic changes in membership and  voting rules required by  this  legisla tion for a new Board will not result in  genuine reforms.  I  appreciate  the effort  to achieve  uniformity in Federal planning efforts  by requiring the Board to promulgate,  by  rule,  new  planning  principles,  standards, and procedures (hereafter  ""Principles and Standards""). It is im portant to note that the principles and  standards were issued as rules in 1979.  However, they were reissued as guide lines in 1981. The important distinc tion between ""rules"" and ""guidelines""  is that rules are third party enforcea ble through court action. Thus, if the  principles and standards were  issued  as rules, any deviation from the rules  by Federal  planners  could  lead  to  ",1985

1723,375,22,Mr. RAY.," Mr. Speaker, this year I offered  an amendment to  the Department of De fense authorization bill which directs  the  Secretary of Defense to report to the Con gress each year on the state of the textile  and apparel industrial base in this country.  I was pleased that this amendment was ac cepted by the conferees, and I would like to  take a few moments to tell you why I be lieve this amendment is important.  It is jokingly said that ""we cannot have  our soldiers fighting in Japanese uniforms  and sleeping in Chinese tents,"" Mr. Speak er, but I think there is a nugget of truth in  this statement. If our Nation is going to be  assured of military readiness, we have to  know that our textile  industrial base can  mobilize  to meet our needs-from para chutes to uniforms, from chemical warfare  garb to coverings and casings.  This report to be prepared by the Depart ment of Defense will address  these con cerns. The report prepared by the Depart ment of Defense will provide crucial infor mation for all Representatives to consider  when  they are making their decisions or  their votes on readiness issues.  My  amendment was drafted  loosely  to  allow for the broadest amount of informa tion to be  included. Research into all as pects of the textile and apparel industrial  base will be conducted, including the man ufacturers' ability to meet initial mobiliza tion requirements with domestic materials,  to obtain necessary machinery for produc tion  through  domestic  sources,  and  to  answer specific, specialized orders of the  various services for strategic and  tactical  operations.  I feel certain that the report which will  be produced because of this amendment  will be a valued tool to be used by all Mem bers in their consideration of our Nation's  military readiness.

1725,375,22,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, in the confer ence  committee  on Gramm-Rudman we  have been trying to turn the sow's ear of  sequestering  into a  silk purse. We have  washed the mud off, we have trimmed the  hog hairs, but it still smells and looks like  a pig's ear.  It is full of illogicals.  If we fail to reach our deficit reduction  goal and  sequestering comes  into  force,  revenue raising agencies like the IRS and  Customs would find their budgets cut.  It is  a  proven  fact  that cutting  those  agencies cuts revenues by much more than  the amount saved in reducing the agencies.  The IRS returns $20 for every one spent  on compliance programs. The Collections  Division returns $25 for every dollar spent  on it. Customs applies its manpower to pro grams which return $27 to $1.  Therefore,  sequestering  a  dollar  from  either agency costs $20 to $27 in revenues.  That increases the deficit, which means  we  need  to  sequester even more  in  the  future.  It is like a dog chasing its tail into ex haustion. In this case, the tail tastes like a  pig's ear.  I supported the House passed version of  Gramm-Rudman because it forces tougher  congressional action on  the deficits  than  does the original version. But as the above  example shows, when it comes to sequester ing we have a long, long ways to go before  we have a mechanism that makes any sense  at all.

1727,375,22,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the  retirement of Bob Huttenhoff, the publish er and president of the Salinas Californian.

The key is that the Cali fornian  cares  about  the  community  it  serves-and it shows.  Bob Huttenhoff was born in 1920 into a  newspaper  family  and was  a  newspaper  carrier through high school. He worked his  way through the University of Kansas as a  stereotype/pressman. After serving during  World War II, he began his career in news papers, working on six daily newspapers in  the Midwest and southern California.  Bob joined the Salinas Californian as a  display  salesman  in 1950. He was  soon  named retail advertising manager, and was  then promoted  to advertising director.

1731,414,22,Mr. RIEGLE.," Mr. President, this is  an amendment that attempts to meet  the most serious problems of Ameri ca's veterans who are placed in jeop ardy by the Gramm-Rudman proposi tion as it is now written.  I  have  talked with a  number of  people who are close  to  these pro grams, and we have been in touch with  the various organizations that repre sent veterans in the country. At the  end of my remarks, I will cite from let ters I have received  today from  the  American Legion, the Veterans of For eign Wars, and other veterans' organi zations. They state their very strong  support for this amendment and why  they think there is a strong case  in  equity for us to make this adjustment  to the Gramm-Rudman proposal.  In terms of what this amendment  would do, it comes in two parts.  The  first part of  the amendment  deals with the veterans' compensation  COLA  adjustment,  and  it  would  exempt that COLA adjustment from  automatic reductions which are now  scheduled to take place under Gramm Rudman.  What I am suggesting in this amend ment is that we treat the cost-of-living  adjustment for a veteran who has a  disability for which he or she is receiv ing compensation the same way we are  proposing to exempt it for Social Secu rity recipients. If we should fail to do  that, it seems to me that, in effect, we  will  initiate a discrimination against  what I think can be safely said is the  Nation's highest priority category of  veterans-namely,  those who  suffer  some  impairment  from  service-con nected disabilities.  The service-connected disability pay ment is based upon the average earn ings resulting from that person's serv ice disability, and each year that per son's earning impairment is adjusted  for inflation. They do not get any ad ditional spending power, but they are  protected against inflation, so that if  inflation occurs, the buying power of  the veterans' compensation is adjusted  so that they stay even. That, I think,  is a critically important factor, espe cially in the lives of this group of indi viduals.  President Reagan has been very out spoken on this issue. In his campaign  of 1980, when he spoke to the VFW  convention  in  Chicago,  President  Reagan said that cutting the compen sation COLA's would be ""a breach of  faith with those who suffer from serv ice-connected disabilities.""  Since that time,  in a couple of in stances, he has attempted  to back  away from that commitment, but that  is not something Congress has been  willing to do, and I hope we will not do  it now. We can prevent it by the adop tion of the amendment I offer.  I do not think there is any justifica tion for striking out the cost-of-living  adjustment for veterans in the catego ry  of  service-connected  disabilities.  What we are talking about here are  people with, in many cases, serious im pairments.  In the case of veterans who have lost  limbs, there is a total of about 23,000  individuals  in that category-that is,  having lost one or more limbs of their  body.  There are another 36,000 who have  lost  the use of one or more of the  limbs of  their body  and  they are,  therefore, in this category because of  sustaining that loss in the service of  this country.  Now, much has been said about con tracts-contracts  to defense contrac tors,  contracts  for  agricultural pro grams, and, as a matter of fact, a great  distinction  is made  in  the Gramm Rudman proposal to say that existing  contracts have to be honored and they  have to be treated in a special fashion,  in a kind of exempt status.  I  think we have a contract of an  even more  important kind with  the  service people of  this country who  served the country and who suffered a  disability as a  result of that service  commitment on  their part and who  now receive a benefit to make up for  the earnings lost and who receive a  cost-of-living  adjustment  to  protect  them against inflation eating away the  value of that service-connected disabil ity payment.  So I think the contract idea, in my  mind, is even stronger in this instance,  where we have asked people to serve  the country, and they have done so  with valor and they have come back  having sustained injuries of a major  sort, and it seems to me it is appropri ate  that we  take  that  into account  when we look at their cost-of-living ad justment each year.  If we should fail to do this, this is  the situation we are going to find: You  will have on the same street in Amer ica,  in  two houses side by side, one  neighbor who receives a Social Securi ty payment, and that neighbor, when  the annual cost-of-living adjustment is  made for Social Security recipients be cause  they  are  protected  by  the  Gramm-Rudman package as it is now  drawn, when the inflation adjustment  is made,  that person  in  that house  who receives Social Security will  re ceive the COLA adjustment and they  will  be  protected  against  inflation;  whereas, the next-door neighbor, who  is a disabled veteran and who is receiv ing a compensation payment for that  disability, that person will be denied  their cost-of-living adjustment.  I do not know how we can say as a  Senate or any other public-policy insti tution,  that  the  family  in  the one  house who is going to receive the costof-living adjustment under the Social  Security Program is entitled to it-as I  think they are-but to then turn and  say to the disabled veteran that lives  in the house next door, ""Sorry, you  are not going to get your cost-of-living  adjustment because somehow our com mitment to you is not quite as impor tant or something that we feel that we  are bound by.""  Well, I think it is as important and I  think we are bound by it, and I think  we have an obligation to meet it. So  the first half of my amendment would  be to protect that cost-of-living adjust ment for those individuals who receive  the veterans' service-connected disabil ity compensation.  The second half of the amendment  relates to a colloquy that the Senator  from Texas, Senator GRAMM,  and  I  had the other day on veterans' pro grams  generally  and whether  the  House version had been more respon sive  to the needs of veterans in this  country  or whether  the Gramm Rudman proposal was more  respon sive. It is very interesting that the vet erans' organizations  in  the country  have  expressed  themselves  strongly  pref erring the House version and not  preferring  the Gramm-Rudman ver sion. So  I  think  they ought  to be  looked to in terms of the question of  which version does a better job of pro tecting the veterans.  But in that discussion, as we talked  about it,  I said at that time that I  would make an effort to try to take  and provide more protection,  impor tant protection for part of the veter ans' programs that I thought were the  ones that were the most critical to the  veterans in the country and particular ly in the health care area.  So what  the  second part of my  amendment does, it moves the veter ans' health care program from catego ry II over to category I. And in catego ry  I,  that means  that  increases  in  spending for veterans' hospitals might  have to be removed if we get into the  sequestering process, but  that  they  could not be cut below that; you could  not go into the body of the fundamen tal health-care programs for veterans  and  the veterans' hospitals  to make  further automatic cuts; that we would  put that particular area of the pro gram over  in category  I  so  that  it  would bear some of the burden but it  would not be subjected to major cuts  or massive cuts which otherwise would  occur  if we had a major sequester  order.  My  thinking on  that  is  this: You  have in our population today a large  number of veterans who are of an age  from service in World War II or serv ice  in the Korean war or service  in  Vietnam or,  for  that matter,  times  other  than  that,  in  service  to our  country, whether for a long number of  years or for a shorter period of time,  ",1985

1734,427,22,Mr.  RIEGLE.," Mr.  President,  I  should like to emphasize what I think  is  the contract issue. We are saying  now, with respect to outstanding de fense  contracts, outstanding agricul tural contracts, and so forth, that they  are exempt from the automatic cuts,  should they be required, because they  are contracts.  I  think this meets the test of any  reasonable definition of what is a con tract, and that is what we have obli gated to do with the veterans of this  country, particularly those who have  suffered severe  losses  from war,  in cluding  the survivors of  those who  gave their lives in various conflicts.  In this area, we should treat those  folks  the same way we  treat  those  under Social Security. I believe there  is a special requirement in this case  that goes beyond defense contracts.  This is the ultimate defense contract.  We  contracted with  people  to put  their lives at risk. Many lost their lives  and lost their active strength, and we  should stand by those commitments.

Thus, with the  preliminary facts in mind-the United  States contributions  to UNFP A,  the  UNFP A contributions to the Chinese  program,  and  some  of  the  details  about  how UNFP A  assistance was  used-let us take a close look at the  Chinese program itself. For this pur pose, I will put into the RECORD vari ous accounts and reports  that have  been  either made  available  to my  office or published elsewhere.  The first item is the report by China  expert, Dr. John S. Aird, formerly of  the U.S. Bureau of  the Census but  now  retired. Drawing  chiefly  from  Chinese sources, Dr. Aird shows un equivocally the ruthlessness and bar barity of the Chinese program.  The second  item  is a Washington  Post series of January 7 and 8, 1985,  by Michael Weisskopf, on the China  situation.  The third item is a Wall Street Jour nal piece of May 13, 1985, by China  expert Steve Mosher on the UNFP A  connection.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent  that  these materials,  including  footnotes, be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  COERCION IN FAMILY PLANNING: CAUSES,  METHODS, AND CONSEQUENCES  <By John S. Aird>  SUMMARY  The undeniable effectiveness of the Chi nese family planning program owes much to  its coerciveness. From Chinese sources it is  clear that many people comply because they  have no choice. The Chinese authorities  insist  that  strict  control  of  population  growth is essential not just for China's mod ernization but  to  assure  adequate  food,  clothing, housing, health, and employment  for the people. But limiting families to one  child violates traditional family values still  deeply entrenched. It also means that many  parents will have no one to look after them  in old age. They resist the policy be spread ing rumors, removing IUDs without permis sion, destroying female infants in the hope  of having a  son, and direct hostile acts  against  family  planning workers. Many  cadres share the attitudes of the people and  are reluctant to enforce the program.  To overcome this resistance, the authori ties maintain extreme pressures both on the  cadres and on couples of childbearing age.  Cadres are penalized for failure to meet tar gets or for allowing couples to have unau thorized children. People who get pregnant  without permission are lectured, harassed,  publicly humiliated, fined, deprived of con tract land, denied food, water, and electrici ty, and ""mobilized""  to have abortions. In  the peak year of coerciveness, 1983, the cen tral authorities ordered  that all couples  with two or more children be sterilized, all  women with one child have IUDs inserted,  and all unauthorized pregnancies be abort ed. The escalation of coercion has not been  steady. Periods of intensive coercion have  alternated with periods of partial remission,  when the central authorities disavowed co ercive measures and blamed them on the  local cadres. The case of Huiyang Prefec ture, Guangdong Province, shows how coer cive tactics approved by the central and pro vincial authorities can be represented in the  media as examples of ""patient and meticu lous ideological work.""  In communications addressed to foreign ers,  the Chinese central authorities  insist  that they disapprove of coercion and quick ly put a stop to it wherever it is discovered.  This claim has not deceived most foreign re porters in China but it has been widely ac0The Interpretations and opinions presented In  this chapter are those of the author and do not rep resent the views of the United States Government  or the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

In 1983, the United Nations gave one  of its first population awards to the head of  China's State Family Planning Commission,  which the Chinese authorities cited as proof  that the whole world approved and support ed their program. The United Nations Fund  for Population Activities has a continuing  multi-million dollar program of assistance  to China,  including  projects  supporting  family planning, despite a provision in its  charter prohibiting aid for coercive family  planning programs.  Some of the immediate consequences of  reduced fertility in China are salutary, such  as the easing of pressures on school enroll ments and employment opportunities, but  some of the long-range effects may be more  problematical. Chinese demographers have  expressed concern about the rapid aging of  the population in the next century and the  serious social  security burden  that  is  in  prospect. Other Chinese are worried about a  generation of pampered only children grow ing up to be willful, selfish, undisciplined,  and ill-adapted to life under socialism. If the  economic  gains  promised  the  people  in  return for surrendering a part of their par enthood fail to materialize, an undercurrent  of disillusionment with profound political  implications could result. The responsibility  for coercion in the Chinese program rests  not only with the Party leaders who direct ed the program and the Chinese demogra phers who rationalized it but also with the  foreign agencies and  individuals who ap plauded and encouraged it.  INTRODUCTION  Since the early 1970s, the People's Repub lic of China has been pursuing what has  proved to be the most successful national  family planning program the world has ever  seen. Its effectiveness can be demonstrated  beyond all doubt from the official popula tion data. But exactly why the Chinese have  been successful in an undertaking in which  many other countries have made little head way is a matter of sharp dispute. Official  spokesmen have attributed China's success  mainly to persuasive propaganda and an ef ficient delivery system for family planning  services. They  tell foreign audiences  that  the people of China recognize the benefits  of family limitation both to the state and to  themselves,  that they support the family  planning program, and that they practice  birth control voluntarily. However, the over whelming weight  of  the  evidence  from  within China makes it clear that the pro gram is compulsory and that many people  comply because they have no choice.  In foreign circles, the debate over whether  or not the Chinese family planning program  is coercive  is mainly between  representa tives of the mass media, who have repeated ly drawn attention to its inhumane tactics,  and the representatives of organizations ad vocating control of population growth, who  frequently echo Chinese claims and some times add their own testimonials that the  program is purely voluntary. A realistic ap praisal of the Chinese program is important  not only for China but also for international  organizations offering family planning as sistance and other developing countries that  might consider following the Chinese exam ple. For China  the sudden demographic  changes and the methods used to achieve  them have economic, social, and political  consequences that may cause acute distress  in the future and could threaten the stabili",1985
1749,466,22,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation to designate  the city of Naples as a place of holding  Federal court  in Florida's Southern  District. This designation is both nec essary and timely.  For years the people of Naples and  surrounding areas have had to travel  over 200 miles in order to serve jury  duty or conduct business  in Federal  court in Miami. This has made their  access to Federal court both expensive  and inconvenient.  As southwest Florida continues  to  outpace  the Nation  in growth,  this  problem  is obviously going  to affect  more and more people. According to  statistics from the U.S. Bureau of the  Census, Florida will be the third larg est State  in population by  the year  2000. Much of this new growth is ex pected to be centered in the Southern  District of Florida. The Florida Gover nor's Office of Planning and Budget ing  predicted  recently  in  Florida  Trend magazine that Collier County,  which includes Naples, would grow ap proximately 74 percent in the next 15  years.  It would not be prudent to wait until  the situation reaches critical propor tions to act, especially when circum stances in the area are ripe for imme diate action. After Naples has been  designated as a place of holding court,  the Federal Government must either  find appropriate space in existing fa cilities  or  construct  a  building  in  which court can be held.  Since Collier County is in the proc ess of developing a new judicial center,  it may be  possible  to  include  the  needed space in the new facility. This  could save time and money for both  the residents and the Federal Govern ment.  The proposal to designate Naples as  a place of holding court is supported  by the bench of the Southern District,  area bar associations,  and  the  resi dents of Naples and surrounding areas.  I urge my colleagues to support this  essential legislation.e  By Mr. CRANSTON <for him self, Mr. KASTEN, Mr. DODD,  Mr. BOSCHWITZ, Mr.  INOUYE,  Mr. HATFIELD, Mr. LAUTENBERG,  Mr. PACKWOOD, Mr. HEINZ, and  Mr. KENNEDY):  S. 1831. A bill to amend the Arms  Export and Control Act  to  require  that congressional vetoes of certain  arms exports proposals be enacted into  law; to the Committee on Foreign Re lations.  ARMS EXPORTS CONTROL ACT AMENDMENTS  ",1985
1750,466,22,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  am  today  joining with a bipartisan  group of cosponsors  to  introduce a  small  but  important  procedural  amendment to the Arms Export Con trol Act CAECA]. This measure, co sponsored by Senators KASTEN, Do DD,  BOSCHWITZ, INOUYE, HATFIELD, LAUTEN BERG, PACKWOOD, KENNEDY, and HEINZ,  would simply restore the provision in  law providing expedited procedures for  resolutions of disapproval introduced  pursuant  to  section  36(b)  of  the  AECA.  Our proposal would not grant Con gress any new powers in this area. The  AECA already provides for expedited  procedures for concurrent resolutions.  Since  the 1981 Supreme Court deci sion in the Chadha case rejecting the  legislative  veto,  Congress  has  em ployed joint resolutions of disapproval  as means of manifesting opposition to  a particular sale. The problem-which  we faced recently on the Jordan arms  resolution and which we may  face  again  next  February  if  Senators  choose to push a resolution that would  bar a Jordan sale-is that while a con current  resolution  of  disapproval  enjoys expedited procedures prevent ing filibusters, a joint resolution does  not.  The AECA  provisions  of  section  36(b)  for arms export  reviews work  best when Congress can proceed in a  deliberate and timely manner. For this  reason, I hope that our colleagues will  join with us in supporting this impor tant proposal  to  clarify  procedural  safeguards. It should be noted  that  our legislation is drafted to include ex pedited procedures for resolutions in troduced pursuant to sections of the  AECA which effect leasing and private  arms trans! ers.  It is my intention to work in a bipar tisan spirit with the leadership of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  so that we might have prompt consid eration of  this measure. This would  enable the full Senate to act on the  legislation before we recess in the clos ing weeks of 1985.  e ",1985
1751,466,22,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I am pleased  to  join  in  introducing  this bill to provide that joint resolu tions of disapproval pursuant to sec tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act be accorded expedited procedures.  ",1985
1752,492,22,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, in the October  29, 1985 edition of the Wall Street Journal,  reporter Jeanne Saddler tells the story of  John Weyrick, an Orlando, FL, small busi nessman who was  able  to obtain more  work,  thanks  to a  new, high-technology  phone gadget that kept track of the tele  phone numbers of everyone who  called  him-even when  they didn't leave a mes  sage.  To me, this story was good news. I'm all  for John Weyrick having access to what  ever new whizbang phone gadgetry he can  November 5, 1985  afford. It helps his business and it helps the  phone company's business.  But it's not right to make senior citizens  and small corner grocery store owners sub sidize John's new high-technology service.  That's why I'm introducing a bill which  will make sure that all the parties-John,  the phone company, the senior citizen, and  the grocer-come out ahead.  Here's how my bill-which I'm calling  the Telephone Ratepayer Protection and  Technology Promotion Act-works.  State utility commissions will be given  the authority to allow local Bell operating  companies  to  provide  new  information  services and to manufacture telecommuni  ~ations equipment. In exchange, the com missions must  first  set  up  regulations  which prevent the phone companies from  using any of the revenues derived from the  provision of basic  local phone service or  other regulated services  to help pay  the  costs of these new services.  Everybody wins under this bill. The el  derly woman pays only for what she gets basic phone service. John Weyrick pays for  what he gets-access to new  technologies  that  improve his business prospects. And  the  local  phone  company  gets what  it  needs-the ability to develop new technol ogies and new services so  thst they can  compete  in  the emerging  telecommunica  tions market.  No one pretends that this bill will single  handedly solve all of the problems  that  have arisen in the wake of the divestiture  of AT&T. We have a  long way  to go  to  ensure that all Americans have access to  affordable phone service, and  that all of  the players in the telecommunications mar ketplace have the ability to compete on a  level playing field.  I do believe, however, that this legislation  symbolizes what we need more of if we are  to solve  those problems: Approaches  that  promote competition in those sectors where  the market will bear it but provide basic  protection in those areas where it will not.  In sum, this bill recognizes that the goals  of universal service and technological inno vation are not incompatible. We can have  affordable  service  for everyone. And we  can foster  the  technological explosion  in  telecommunications.  I believe  that's why  this bill has the support of the Consumer  Federation of America and why I am opti mistic that it will also be favorably received  by the local operating companies.  The text of the bill follows:  H.R. 3687  A bill to permit the Bell operating compa nies to provide information services and to  manufacture  telecommunications  equip ment so long as such services and manu facturing are not subsidized with the pro ceeds from the provision of local exchange  telephone service or other regulated tele communications services  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1753,505,22,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, on October  14, 1985, Roy McDonald of Chattanooga,  TN was  awarded  the  coveted Dorothy  Patten ""Love of Chattanooga"" award.  Roy McDonald is a true American great.  If the term ""rugged individualist"" had not  already been phrased, it would have when  Mr. McDonald came along. He epitomizes  the admirable concepts of personal faith in  Jesus Christ, love of country, hard work,  meeting challenges head-on, achievement,  and  then  using his  accomplishments  to  help other people.  Roy McDonald was born  in  the  little  town of Graysville in the northern end of  Hamilton County on November 25, 1901. He  remembers the time when it was an over night trip by wagon with this father to get  to Chattanooga. He grew up in Chattanoo ga, helping his father in a family grocery  store and carrying a newspaper route. Both  of these activities were to play a large part  in his life.  From a 70-store grocery chain, which he  developed, sprang a newspaper originally  called  the Chattanooga Free Press. The  paper became a daily  in August of 1936.  Roy McDonald is the founder and publish er of today's Chattanooga News-Free Press,  the community's largest newspaper.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The attributes that made Roy McDonald  successful in business were also beneficial  in his service to this fellow man. Active in  many civic causes, his love for Chattanoo ga has been evidenced for more than eight  decades. For example, he has headed  the  Chamber of Commerce, led the Community  Chest Drive and was chairman of the board  of Erlanger Hospital  for more  than 20  years.  Roy McDonald  is  credited with  bringing prepaid medical insurance to the  community through Blue Cross-Blue Shield  of Tennessee.  A man who has little interest in material  things, he is happiest when facing a chal lenge  and  when  serving  quietly  and  humbly. Always an optimist, always eager  to forge ahead to bigger and better things,  he has been outstanding among the leaders  and the servants of the Chattanooga com munity and its people.  This award  is presented only  to  those  people who have distinguished  themselves  in long-time community service and profes sional activities and by contributing to the  enrichment and development of the com munity apart from the person's business or  professional  life.  I applaud  the choice of  Roy McDonald as this year's recipient.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. AARON  CAPLAN  HON. JOE KOLTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 5, 1985  ",1985
1754,505,22,Mr. KOLTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise  to salute a constituent of the Fourth Dis trict of Pennsylvania, Dr. Aaron Caplan.  Dr. Caplan is being honored by American  Legion Post 157 for his exemplary work as  a physician for 50 years and for the his  valor as a combat doctor in World War II.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some in formation about Dr. Caplan with our col leagues.  Dr. Caplan graduated from Lincoln High  School  in  1926. He went on  to  attend  Geneva College in Beaver Falls in 1928 and  1929, concluding his undergraduate work at  the University of Pennsylvania in 1930. In  pursuit of his lifelong dream to be a physi cian, Aaron Caplan  traveled  to Scotland  where he studied medicine at the University  of Glasgow Medical School. After graduat ing with his degree in medicine in 1935, Dr.  Caplan  returned  to Pennsylvania. He  in terned at Passavant Hospital in Pittsburgh  for 1 year after which he returned home to  Ellwood City to open his private practice.  The doctor's office on the second floor at  523 Lawrence Avenue, which was opened in  1936 has proudly remained the workplace  for Dr. Caplan for the past 50 years. Only  once was  the practice of medicine  inter rupted at this location. From April 1941 to  December 1945 Dr. Caplan left the commu nity and his practice to serve his country in  the Army Medical Corps. A major in the  29th Division Artillery, Dr. Caplan served  in Normandy, France and was involved in  D-Day. His efforts earned him the Bronze  30619  Star with oak leaf cluster for meritorious  achievements.  Dr. Caplan's dedication to this communi ty extends beyond his vocation. In 1967 he  was honored by the Jaycees for the Senior  Citizens Distinguished Service Award. That  same year he held the position of chairman  of the Ellwood City borough's diamond ju bilee. He was active in the establishment of  a blood bank program for  the city, was  president of the chamber of commerce in  1965 and was the president of the Ellwood  City Hospital medical staff. He is a charter  member of the Ellwood City Lions Club.  The list of Dr. Caplan's civic accomplish ments  and organization memberships  is  virtually endless. Suffice it to say that Dr.  Caplan is a man of action who has played  an integral part in making Ellwood City a  safer, healthier place to live over the course  of the past 50 years.  In spite of bouts with  illness over the  past 5 years, Dr. Caplan has continued to  service the community diligently, decreas ing his workload by a mere hour each day.  This man of strength has no  immediate  plans for retirement since his concern for  his patients overrides his desire for relax ation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join Ameri can Legion Post 157, his wife Anne, and  their  three  children,  Harvey,  Barbara  Azizio, and Rebekah in honoring Dr. Aaron  Caplan.  CONGRESSIONAL CALL TO  CONSCIENCE  HON. DOUGLAS H. BOSCO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 5, 1985  ",1985
1755,505,22,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  add my voice  to  those of my colleagues  who are protesting the continued persecu tion and mistreatment of Soviet Jews. As a  participant  in  the Congressional Call  to  Conscience, I would like to bring to my col leagues attention the plight of a young re fusnik that I have adopted.  Pavel Astrakhan was born in 1955 and  first applied to emigrate in 1978. He was re fused permission to do so on the grounds  that he ""choose to emigrate without his el derly parents, thus breaking up a family.""  Although Pavel  is  an English  teacher I  translator by profession, he  is unable  to  find work. Thus, he devotes a great deal of  his time to studying the Torah and helping  other Jews process  their applications for  emigration. Pavel is also involved in reli gious seminars which take place unofficial ly and are attended by refusniks and non refusniks. As many as 100 people have at tended these seminars at one time; howev er, a  tourist has reported that attendance  has begun  to drop off because of KGB  raids on  the homes where seminars are  held. Pavel lives in Leningrad with his wife  Sonya  and  their  two-year-old  daughter  Ruth.

1758,557,22,Mrs. HAWKINS.," I have been most  interested these past few weeks in the  issue of disinvestment or redemption  of the securities in the Social Security  trust funds due to Congress' f allure to  extend the debt limit. I had planned to  offer an amendment to the reconcilia tion bill  that would make the  trust  funds whole, but am pleased that the  issue has been addressed in the modifi cation to the Gramm-Rudman bill.  My concern, Mr. Chairman, is this: I  have reviewed the language passed by  the House on this issue, which is iden tical  to  the  language  I would have  used  in my amendment, and believe  that it  is  favorable  to the modifications now contained in the Senate ver sion of Gramm-Rudman.  Mr. Chairman, this issue of redemp tion of the Social Security trust funds  has been widely misunderstood. Essen tially, there are two issues: the first is  actual interest lost to the funds. The  Social Security trust fund is protected  for some lost interest due to the way  Treasury transfers FICA tax receipts  to  the Social Security  trust  funds.  However, the other trust funds-civil  service retirement and military retire ment, for example-are losing millions  of dollars. This problem is taken care  of in the House language and in the  Senate language.  The  second  problem,  however,  is  more completely addressed by the lan guage adopted by  the House. That  problem has to do with the fact that  long-term securities with higher inter est rates have been redeemed that oth erwise would not have been redeemed  had we not bumped up against  the  debt limit. In order to be certain that  those securities are  re-issued at the  same interest rate and with the same  maturity, it is my understanding that  the Treasury Dep:.rtment must be di rected to do so, and that legislative  language simply instructing the Treas ury to pay back the interest does not  assure  the Congress and the elderly  Americans of  this Nation  that  the  Social Security portfolio will be put  back in the same condition as it was  before. Mr. President,  the  language  adopted in the House version was sug gested by officials at the Treasury De partment.  It is for this reason, Mr. Chairman,  that I would urge the Senate confer ees to adopt the House language on  making the trust funds whole in order  to ensure  that  the  trust  funds are  fully restored.  ",1985
1759,557,22,Mr.  PACKWOOD.,  The  Senator  from Florida is absolutely correct. The  House  language  to restore the trust  funds to their condition prior to this  debt limit situation was suggested by  Treasury officials. It is more complete  and should be adopted by the Senate  conferees. I do want to emphasize that  the precise intent of the Senate con ferees is this: The trust funds adverse ly affected by the failure of Congress  to  raise  the debt  limit must be  re stored. They will be restored if Con gress adopts the language drafted by  the Treasury Department. I would like  to thank the Senator for watching this  issue so closely these past few weeks  and for keeping us updated on  the  best solution. Her efforts on behalf of  Social Security  recipients are  to be  commended.  ,1985
1760,557,22,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  I have  one  question  about  the  contracts  provision of this legislation. During the  conference  committee,  the Budget  Committee  staff  indicated  that  the  contracts  language would  result  in  ",1985
1761,583,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator's time has expired.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I  am pleased to join in support of the  nomination  of Mr. Alex Kozinski,  Chief Judge of the U.S. Claims Court,  for appointment to a position on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the ninth  circuit. Chief Judge Kozinski is one of  the most qualified  individuals  to be  nominated for this position in recent  times, notwithstanding the fact that  he is only 35 years of age. Because of  his extraordinary background, and be cause of the extraordinary measures  that those who oppose his nomination  have taken, I would like to review both  his background and the course of his  nomination for the benefit of my col leagues.  Chief Judge Kozinski was born  in  1950  in Bucharest, Rumania. I'm in formed he came to the United States  at the age of 12, and become a natural ized U.S citizen in 1968. After receiv ing his bachelors degree from UCLA in  1972, Chief Judge Kozinski  took his  law degree from that same institution  in 1975. He graduated first in his class.  Following graduation  from UCLA,  Chief Judge Kozinski served as  law  clerk to Hon. Anthony M. Kennedy of  the U.S. Court of Appeals  for  the  Ninth Circuit, the same court to which  he  is now nominated  to be a  judge  himself. The following year, he served  as law clerk to Hon. Warren E. Burger,  the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court. For the next 3 to 4 years, Chief  Judge Kozinski was employed at pres tigious law firms in Los Angeles and in  Washington.  Following the election of President  Reagan, he  served  as deputy  legal  counsel and as assistant counsel in the  Office of the Counsel of the President.  He became  special  counsel  for  the  Merit Systems Protection Board  in  1981. In August 1982, he became chief  trial judge of the U.S. Court of Claims,  and, when that court was abolished  and the new U.S. Claims Court cre ated, Chief Judge Kozinski assumed  his current position. He has held that  position for the past 3 years.  Throughout this period, Chief Judge  Kozinski  has  displayed  remarkable  legal  talent, and has demanded  the  highest standards of both himself and  of those employed by him. At various  times, he has been an innovative, ef fective and dedicated law clerk, attor ney, special counsel, and chief judge.  Nevertheless, a small but dedicated  group of opponents has gone  to ex traordinary lengths to sabotage Chief  Judge Kozinski's nomination. An orga nization called  the Government Ac countability Project has  steadfastly  sought  to elicit damaging  testimony  against Chief Judge Kozinski. Its legal  director  testified against him at the  first  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  hearing in July of this year. In con junction with that group, a. number of  former employees of the Office of Spe cial Counsel of the Merit Systems Pro tection Board testified age.inst Mr. Ko zinski. Some, however, chose not to  testify, but to air their grievances at a  news conference conducted under the  auspices of the Government Account ability Project. None of the allegations  raised by  these opponents  to Chief  Judge Kozinski's nomination had a.ny  serious merit, but served  instead  to  highlight  the  dema.nding  standards  maintained by the judge, as well as, it  must be admitted, the impatience the  judge has displayed with  those who  worked under him who were unwilling  to go about their professional obliga tions with the same sort of dedication.  On September 12, 1985, the Judici ary Committee unanimously, by a 17  to O vote, voted to report Chief Judge  Kozinski's nomination  favorably  to  the full Senate. Notably, at that hear ing, the distinguished Senator from Il linois, Senator SIMON, whose staff had  worked closely with the Government  Accountability Project  in connection  with the nomination, stated that he  knew of no reason to oppose this nom ination.  Nevertheless, long after the nomina tion had been reported to the Senate  floor.  the distinguished chairman of  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  agreed with the Senator from Ohio,  Senator METZENBAUM, to hold a second  hearing. That hearing, held on No vember l, of course, had no bearing on  the committee's recommendation  to  the full Senate, since the nomination  had already been reported to the floor.  Nevertheless, following a recently de veloped pattern concerning adminis tration nominees to the higher Feder al courts or to high positions in the  Justice Department, that hearing fo cused not on  the substance of  the  nominee's testimony or even on the  qualifications of the nominee. Those  issues had been considered and  re solved in the prior hearing.  No, the November 1 hearing, much  like the June 22 hearing on the nomi nation on William Bradford Reynolds  to be Associate Attorney General, fo cused on the question of whether the  nominee had misled,  in any respect,  the Judiciary Committee in its delib erations. In his Dear Colleague letter  of October 30, 1985, the distinguished  Senator from Michigan,  in reference  to affidavits provided by former em ployees of the Office of Special Coun sel, as well as to certain other letters  and documents, suggested that Chief  Judge Kozinski  ""has misled,  in  a  number of instances, the Senate Com mittee and its members.""  I am happy to report today that far  from such a state of affairs, I believe it  can safely be said that Chief Judge  Kozinski's critics,  in their affidavits,  had misled the Senator from Michi ga.n. From my understanding of the  testimony presented  in  that nearly  full day of hearing, none of the allega tions raised about Chief Judge Kozin ski's integrity or his judicial tempera ment proved to have any merit. More over, as the Senator from Utah, Sena so ably demonstrated at  the hearing, the Judiciary Committee  was never misled in its evaluation of  the  nominee's  suitability  for  the  office.  As the Senator from Michigan him self pointed out  in his October 30,  1985, Dear Colleague  letter, he was  ""well aware of support that Judge Kotor HATCH,  ",1985
1762,596,22,Mr.  LEVIN.," Mr. President,  I  am  speaking today again in support of the  Congressional Call  to Conscience  to  draw  attention  to  those who  are  unable to exercise their basic human  rights of freedom and safety.  One particular case about which I  remain gravely concerned, as do many  of my colleagues, is that of Abe Stolar  in the Soviet Union. Abe Stolar is an  American  citizen,  born  in Chicago,  who has repeatedly been denied per mission  to emigrate with his entire  family.  Abe Stolar's wife Gita has an Israeli  passport, and their son Michael has an  American one. They have  tried  for  over a decade to emigrate. Earlier this  year, they thought they might finally  have  that opportunity, but  instead  were offered a cruel choice. The Soviet  Government finally offered  the Sto lars three exit visas, but not one for  Michael's wife Julia. The Stolars faced  the impossible decision of splitting up  their family, or passing up perhaps  their last chance at freedom.  Members of Congress were active in  contacting  the  Soviet  Union  and  urging a humanitarian resolution  to  this case. A telegram signed by 21 Sen ators asked General Secretary Gorba chev to intervene in this matter. I sent  an urgent letter to Ambassador Dobrynin. Unfortunately,  these efforts  were to no avail. The Soviets were in flexible  in refusing  to grant Julia a  visa. The Stolars ultimately did not  use their exit visas, because Abe and  Gita did not want Michael to leave his  wife, and they did not want to leave  Michael behind.  I am very concerned about the un certain future of the Stolars, particu larly Abe and Gita who are quite el derly.  Another  family  facing  a  similar  plight  is  that of Sandra Gubin, an  American citizen separated from her  husband in the Soviet Union.  Sandra met Aleksei Lodisev while  participating in the International Re search and Exchanges Board Program.  This program is part of an official cul tural exchange between the U.S. and  the U.S.S.R. They were married  in  April 1981, and Ms. Gubin returned to  the United States that summer. She  subsequently submitted an invitation  to her husband to join her, and heap plied for an exit visa. He was denied,  and has continued to be denied.  I have worked to help reunite this  couple  for  several years. They are  eager to begin a normal married life  together, and there is no reason for  them to be kept apart.  Leonid Volvovsky is yet another case  which warrants our  attention. The  harassment and arrest of this man is,  regrettably,  indicative of  the  treat ment frequently afforded  those who  try to emigrate.  Leonid Volvovsky has  a  scientific  degree in cybernetics and was elected a  member of the New York Academy of  Sciences. In 1974, Leonid and his wife  Ludmilla  applied  to  repatriate  to  Israel. After the application, both the  Volvovskys  lost  their  jobs and have  had difficulty since finding steady em ployment.  Leonid is self-taught in Hebrew and  has taught others, and was  involved  with  Jewish  cultural  activities  in  Moscow. Evidently because of this, the  family was exiled  to Gorky in 1980.  That same year, Leonid was granted  Israeli  citizenship. Their home has  been searched several  times, and all  Jewish materials confiscated.  On June 26, 1985, Leonid Volvovsky  was arrested. Charged with defaming  the Soviet State, he has recently been  sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment.  His  family and  friends were barred  from his trial, at which he conducted  his own defense.  We must continue to speak out on  behalf  of  people  like Abe  Stolar,  Sandra Gubin, and Leonid Volvovsky,  and we must be willing to seek out and  pursue  any other ways  of helping  them. As a humanitarian nation, we  must work to resolve the frustrating  and tragic problem of those who are  imprisoned or whose family lives are  tom  apart  because  of  restrictive  human rights policies.e  SQUEEZE ON FEET  ",1985
1763,596,22,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, as Sena tor COHEN has also done, I would like  to draw attention to a recent article in  the Wall Street Journal which reaf firms rumors that swift congressional  action could save hundreds of  thou sands of American feet, taken hostage  by  tenacious and oppressive  foreign  shoes. The results of  these  efforts  could bring about a happy ending on  more than one front. Beyond the posi tive  results which would be experi enced by the American shoe industry,  American feet would slowly be rescued  from their insensitive foreign captors.  We could all take great pride in the  legislation which may be passed to re strict foreign shoe imports. Such re strictions  would  become  known  throughout the United States by po diatrists and others, as the ""neat feat  that saved U.S. feet.""  I acknowledge that my view of this  Wall Street Journal article  is some what whimsical, but I think it makes  an important point: American shoes fit'  Americans better. Let's make sure that  Americans have  the opportunity  to  purchase American shoes.  Mr. President, I ask that this article  be printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 28,  1985]  CHEAP IMPORTS PuT THE SQUEEZE ON U.S.  FEET  <By Teri Agins>  NEW YORK.-For Jakki Gill, a medical records clerk,  shopping  for  footwear has  become  an  exasperating  and  ultimately  painful experience.  Most of  the modestly priced shoes she  tries on are  imported, she says, and ""fit  strangely."" They're too tight across the toes  or too wide at the heels, she explains, and  make her feet and  legs ache after a  few  hours.  Foot specialists across  the country are  seeing an increase in patients with similar  complaints. As more Americans, especially  women, buy imported shoes, they're finding  it tough to get a good fit. But because im ports-which will account  for 77% of all  footwear sales in the U.S. this year accord ing  to Commerce Department estimates offer a wide range of fashionable styles at  low prices, consumers wear them anyway.  PAYING WITH PROBLEMS  ""People are compromising more on shoe  fit  these days,"" says Jerome J. Erman, a  Union, N.J., podiatrist. ""and we're paying  for  it with more  foot  problems."" Paul  Taylor, a podiatrist in Silver Spring, Md.,  adds, ""I see patients wearing cheap import ed shoes made of hard plastics who com plain they get blisters and a burning sensa tion on the soles of their feet.""  Eugene Milosh,  president of  the New  York-based American Association of Export ers and Importers, feels that imports aren't  alone to blame. ""The quality is quite high  for  the medium  range  and high-quality  range from places like Italy,"" he says. As for  cheaper models, he adds, ""shoe for shoe and  price range for price range,"" imports stack  up well against domestic shoes.  ",1985

The  amendments  ments were agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  question is on the amendments offered  by  the gentleman from New Jersey  [Mr. RoE], as amended, as modified.  The amendments,  as amended, as  modified, were agreed to.  ",1985
1767,635,22,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, the statement that I  am making in connection with this bill  is one that I would have made yester day but for the elections in New York.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port  of  the  committee  substitute  amendment to H.R. 6, the Water Re sources Conservation, Development,  and Infrastructure Improvement and  Rehabilitation Act of 1985. As  the  principal author of title I of the legis lation-the  Port Development  and  Navigation Improvement Act of 1985, I  am pleased to join with my friend and  colleague,  the gentleman  from New  Jersey [Mr. RoE], in bringing this leg islation before the House for the third  time.  At  this  time,  I would also  like  to  mention the excellent job done by one  of my subcommittee counsels, Larry  Mallon. He has worked long and hard  on the port bill since its inception, and  he deserves a great deal of credit for  his extraordinary effort in the devel opment of this legislation.  This  is  the third consecutive Con gress that has considered comprehen sive reform of the process of authoriz ing, financing, and constructing port  navigation  projects  in  the United  States. Following 7 days of hearings in  the field and here in Washington, and  endless meetings as chairman of the  Merchant Marine Subcommittee, I de veloped and  introduced the grandf a ther of current port development leg islation <H.R. 4627>  in the 97th Con gress-the only such measure reported  to the House in that Congress. Title I  of H.R. 6 incorporates most of the ge neric reforms formulated to expedite  the port development  process  that  have been embodied in every port bill  introduced since then.  I reintroduced the bill <H.R. 1512) in  the 98th Congress, and the Merchant  Marine Committee  reported  it out  again. At  the  request of Chairman  RoE, I agreed to the incorporation of  my  bill  into H.R.  3678-water  re sources  authorization-in  the  98th  Congress, hoping  for  its expeditious  passage. The House acted twice, but  the bill languished in the other body.  I agreed to the inclusion of my port  development  bill  in  the water  re sources legislation last Congress and  this one for one reason-I was assured  it would be acted on quickly. It's no  secret  that  the  administration  is  squarely behind the port development  bill, and its inclusion is critical to the  passage of H.R. 6.  In all,  the Merchant Marine Com mittee  and  the  subcommittee have  held 11 days of hearings on this legis lation spanning  the  last  three Con gresses. I off er this chronology to un derscore the genesis of the legislation  and the commitment of the Merchant  Marine Committee to the enactment  of  comprehensive port development  legislation.  To  those of us on the committee,  title 1 represents the culmination of 5  years of sustained effort toward the  enactment of meaningful procedural  reform of the process of port develop ment in the United States. These re forms affect the authorization, permit ting,  financing,  and construction of  port navigation projects in the nation al interest. The substitute amendment  contains  those procedural and  sub stantive elements we deem critical to  ensure the timely completion of neces sary port projects in the future.  These include:  First, fast tracking. This is reflected  in the adoption of a consolidated eco nomic, engineering, and environmental  decisionmaking  process  for  port  project review and approval involving  all  levels of government,  the public,  and affected interests.  These critically needed reforms will  shorten the approval process for an in dividual port project from 22 years to  2¥2 years on the average. The fast track process may be utilized by a  local port-whether or not the non Federal  interest seeks  later congres sional  authorization  for  reimburse ment of the Federal share of the cost  of project construction. Fast track is  applicable  to projects undertaken  in  whole or in part by a local port.  Second, project  financing  reforms.  These are reflected foremost  in the  adoption of a graduated system of cost  sharing between the Federal Govern ment and non-Federal interests corre sponding  to  project  depth.  This  system is based upon the adoption of  an international recognized threshold  of 45 feet in depth as the line of de marcation between general cargo and  deep-draft ports. This  recommenda tion emanated from a survey of the  national port policy practices of most  developed countries conducted by the  Merchant Marine Committee.  The adoption of a cost-sharing ap proach  for  the  financing  of  new  project construction incorporates the  substitution of a market test, in lieu of  ",1985

1770,661,22,Mr. ROE., I yield to the gentleman  from Louisiana.  I  ,1985
1771,661,22,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Chairman,  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment on the floor and join,  if I may, with the statement of my col leagues from Louisiana.  Looking at the map, you can see the  reason  for  our opposition. All  the  water in an area larger than most na tions  on Earth  flows  through our  town. And to have us pay the full 30  percent cost of flood control protec tion in that case is not in the Nation's  interest nor our own.  I thank the chairman.  ",1985
1772,661,22,Mr. ROE.," I thank the gentleman.  You know, I have been laboring in  the vineyards with most everyone in  this House, and it has nothing to do  with partisanship. If the gentleman  from Pennsylvania would listen, there  is a series, I understand, which I read  about, on  the  television now.  It  is  colorful and talks about the heritage  of our country. I believe the name of it  is ""The North and South."" We have  been doing budgets and all that sort of  thing around here in the last couple or  3 weeks, and I have not had a chance  yet to see any of the episodes. It talks  about a Confederate and a Yankee. It  has a person from the Confederacy, a  young fellow, and a young fellow from  the North.  As I understand it, they get togeth er,  and  they become dear personal  friends, and they go on to West Point,  and  they go  in  the service of  their  country. The  division  between  the  areas then arose, between the North  and the South.  I  think that the North and South  battle is over. What happens in Louisi ana or Mississippi or any other place  down South has a material bearing on  what happens in New Jersey as it does  to what happens in the Midwest and  the Far West.  I know I have spoken on this issue,  and I have been concerned with this  issue, myself, and I am sure people  could come back to me and say, ""Bob,  you are chameleon, you are jumping  from one side to the other."" Well, I  never was on one side or the other.  The battle was fairness and equity. I  wonder what we say when we come to  a  law that was passed in 1928 when  the Congress decided this issue. I just  think it is wrong, without public hear ings and getting  into  the  ramifica tions; what does it mean to just come  up and put an amendment on the floor  and say that, ""From 1928 until now all  bets are off because I don't believe it  should be helpful  in  the Mississippi  area, what we ought to do is cut that  all off by one single debate.""  So from my point of view,  I  reap praised my opinion because I, along  with  ARLAN  STANGELAND,  ""JIMMY""  HOWARD, the chairman of our commit tee, and the ranking minority member,  Mr.  SNYDER, we  have  talked about  these different  issues  in equity and  fairness. We came up with the point  that we have been considering; in the  bill we have a concern that has arisen  in five of the States on the upper Mis sissippi, and in that particular concern  we are developing the relationship of  the economics involved, the dynamics  of the natural areas, and what hap pens in those upper waters that affect  the Mississippi. Five States are  in volved.  We are establishing a special com mission. And the commission is going  to be allocated, at least under the au thorization, I believe, it was approxi mately $150 million.  We are going to spend $150 million  to  look at what happens up  there.  Strangely, though, strangely, in that  authorization,  there  is not any cost  sharing involved. There is not any cost  sharing involved; and the reason for  this is because it affects the entire dy namics of the beginning of the Missis sippi River and its tributaries.  Rife throughout this bill is fair play,  and I helped to write most of it, and I  can  tell  you  this, Member  after  Member in every State, and no State is  sovereign on this comment I choose to  make, in every single State Members  have legitimately come to the commit tee and they have said, ""We need an  adjustment here, we need some help  there, we can't afford  to carry that  there. Can  the  committee  consider  this?""  I would suggest to you that if you  were to look at the bill in depth and  you were to pick out point by point, we  have been generous, because the gen erosity was needed to be able to get  the job done in the national interest.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from New Jersey CMr. ROE]  has expired.  <On  request of Mr. EDGAR and by  unanimous consent, Mr. ROE was al lowed to proceed for 2 additional min utes.)

1775,661,22,Mr. EDGAR.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I understand the gen tleman's comments.  I  just want  to  point out to the gentleman that in the  bill that the gentleman brought to the  House floor 1 year ago in the last Con gress, we had  in  fact  included  lan guage  like my amendment  today,  treat the tributaries to the Mississippi  like all other tributaries to all other  river systems. The flood control cost  sharing in our bill as we brought it to  the House floor last year included the  language that I am now asking to in clude here.  I would just urge the gentleman to  accept it now like he did in 1984.  ",1985

1777,700,22,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Chairman,  offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  I  Amendment offered by Mr. WEAVER: Page  308, after line 23, insert the following:  SEc. 1006. The project for Elk Creek Lake,  Rogue River Basin, Oregon, authorized by  the Flood Control Act of 1962,  is not au thorized after the date of the enactment of  this Act.  ",1985
1778,700,22,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like  to rise  in support of this  amendment and tell my distinguished  colleague,  the chairman of  the sub committee, and the ranking minority  member of the subcommittee, that I  believe  this amendment strengthens  your bill. I support your bill. I think it  is a good bill. There are extremely val uable projects in this bill that I believe  will enhance the strength of this coun try, and I commend you for it. I be lieve my amendment further strength ens the bill. It does not touch any pro vision in the bill now. I want that un derstood.  The Elk Creek Dam is not in this  bill. It was authorized in 1962, 23 years  ago, and it was authorized as part of a  three-dam project. Two of those dams,  Lost Creek Dam, Apple Creek Dam,  have been built. They are in operation  now. The third dam, Elk Creek Dam,  the Corps of Engineers now says is no  longer necessary. The  job  is  being  done by the two dams up there.  I would  like  to  tell my colleagues  that,  for  instance,  the flood control  situation in the Rogue River Basin is  taken care of by these two dams now  in operation. So,  therefore, we have  here a $120 million dam that is not  needed. The Corps of Engineers says,  ""We do not want to build it.""  The Oregonian, the leading newspa per of Oregon, the statewide daily, a  pro-public works newspaper, has said  this is the kind of overvalued and irre sponsible project that gives legitimate  projects a bad name.  Sentiment  in Oregon  has  turned  against the dam. Even a newspaper in  the Rogue Valley, the Ashland Daily  Tidings, has said, ""We don't want the  dam.""  And  so  in  these days  of  serious  budget cutting, here is $120 million we  can save. Actually we can save $32 mil lion cash today on the barrelhead by  deauthorizing this dam.  I want to make two things very clear  to 'the Members, and I think these are  extremely important things. First, the  damsite was wholly in my district for  40 years. In 1975  I prevailed on the  House to kill this dam. It was wholly  in my district. Reapportionment came  along a couple of years ago and drew  new boundaries. Now  the dam  lies  along the boundary of the district. It  is  shared by  another Member  and  myself. But its effects, flood control  and irrigation, what there is of them,  are in my district. The major irriga tion area is entirely in my district. The  people affected are in my district. The  Rogue River-and this is a dam on the  Rogue River system-the Rogue River  flows 200 miles from the dam to the  ocean, and lies mostly in my district,  for over half the distance, entirely in  my district. So this dam is, in effect, in  my district, although the site itself lies  along the boundary.  The second point  I would  like  to  make  to my colleagues  is  that con struction has not begun. That is very  important.  Construction  has  not  begun. They have been building  a  road, $40 million for a road that goes  nowhere to nowhere, and literally no where to nowhere, and is money that  should also be rescinded. But we are  talking now about the dam itself and  the deauthorization of this dam. That  is the issue.  And to make sure the construction  of  this dam had not begun,  I went  during Labor Day down, and I stood at  the very site of the dam, right where  the dam is going to be built. I stood  there, and there is not a thing done,  absolutely nothing. No construction of  any kind has been done. As a matter  of fact, when I say I stood in the dam  site, I stood right in the stream. There  is something you should know about  Elk Creek itself, right where the dam  is. I jumped over the stream. And I am  not a particularly good jumper. This is  a little, tiny creek. It has no power in  it, no hydroelectric power, no nothing.  The Corps of Engineers says it now  really does not have flood control, the  irrigation project is killed. The Corps  has canceled any recreational develop ments. The corps says it is just simply  not needed. So it seems to me that in  this  day  of  budget  cutting-maybe  some other day we  could afford  to  spend $120 million on a dam that did  nothing, but today it seems this is the  place to cut the deficit.  So when  I could stand and  jump  over this little stream right where the  dam is going to be built, is there any  wonder that the Corps of Engineers  does not want to build this monument  to waste? Remember, I emphasize, this  dam is not in this bill. This dam was  authorized in 1962.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman from Oregon [Mr. WEAVER]  has expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. WEAVER  was allowed to proceed for 5 additional  minutes.  ",1985
1779,700,22,Mr. WEAVER.," I stood in the middle  of this stream, actually jumped over it.  It is a little creek. To dam it is incon ceivable, and it is not in this bill. It  was authorized  in 1962 as part of a  three-dam project. Two of the dams  have been built. They take care of the  flood control, the irrigation, the mu nicipal water, good  recreation  facili ties. And again I emphasize, I support  this bill. This amendment strengthens  an already good bill.  So we should not go ahead, mindless ly, as part of a three-dam project-and  that is what has happened. It was part  of a  three-dam project planned  20  years ago, and we are just mindlessly  going ahead and building it, if we do,  without reevaluating it.  So I am going to conclude by asking  my colleagues to consider themselves a  board of directors of a company, and  you are making products to sell, and  are you going  to make  them at a  profit? Consider the House as a board  ",1985

As you notice, I have remained mute  to this point, allowing the Representa tives from the great States of Califor nia, Oregon, and Washington, because  it fell upon their immediate needs to  debate that issue; but from the com mittee's point of view,  I compliment  the gentleman from withdrawing this  amendment,  bei::ause we,  too,  have  been reviewing this, as the gentleman  knows,  in Public Works, and particu larly in our Water Resources Commit tee, as it relates to the Corps of Engi neers' hydro project-and I appreciate  the gentleman from California men tioning that-thoughout this country.  Any  type of program  that would  emerge should have real solid review,  should have real good understanding  and should really follow some kind of  uniform policy.

1788,726,22,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Chairman,  offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. ENGLISH: On  page 366, strike lines 8 through 22 and all  that is contained therein and insert in lieu  thereof the following:  Section 201 of the Flood Control Act of  1970, as amended by Section 153 of  the  Water Resources Development Act of 1976,  is amended by strikin1 out the last sentence  under  the heading  ""Arkansas-Red River  Basin"" and insertin1 in lieu thereof the fol  lowing: ""Construction shall not be initiated  on any element of such project  involving  the Arkansas River Basin until such ele  ment has been approved by the Secretary of  the Army. The chloride control projects for  the Red River Basin and the Arkansas River  Basin shall be considered to be authorized  as separate projects with separate authority  under Section 203 of the Flood Control Act  of 1966, as amended."".  Mr. ENGLISH <during the reading>.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con sent that the amendment be consid ered  as  read  and  printed  in  the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Oklahoma?  There was no objection.  ",1985
1789,726,22,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of my amendment which  separates the authorization of the Ar kansas  River Basin water  quality  project  from  the Red River Basin  water quality project, and which re quires that the Secretary of the Army  grant approval before any construc tion on any element of the Arkansas  River Basin water quality project can  occur. The intent of this measure is to  ensure that no money authorized and  appropriated for the Red River Basin  water quality project can be spent on  any portion of  the Arkansas River  Basin water  quality  project.  This  amendment  is  the same amendment  which the House adopted during its  consideration of H.R. 2577,  the Sup plemental Appropriations of 1985, ear lier this year.  By separating  the Arkansas River  chloride control project from the Red  River  chloride  control  project, my  amendment requires that each project  stands on its own merits. Unfortunate ly, present  law permits funding au thorized and  intended  for  the Red  River project to be spent on the Ar kansas  River  project.  This  could  happen despite the fact that the Corps  of Engineers has concluded after ex tensive study that the Arkansas River  project  is not economically  feasible  and that the corps should not proceed  with it.  A closer look at the Arkansas project  reveals the actual scope of this billion dollar question mark. Basically,  the  Arkansas River Basin project contains  a series of shallow salt brine ponds  which would be used to collect, store,  divert, and dispose of salt brine. These  ponds would require the sacrifice of at  least 60,000 acres of land in western  Oklahoma.  Congress authorized  the Arkansas  project  in the Flood Control Act of  1970. At the same time, and using the  same provision, Congress authorized  construction on sites for the Red River  project. In 1977 corps officials testified  that unless Congress was prepared to  make a total commitment to the com plete Arkansas project, the Congress  should not support any part of it. Fur thermore, the corps was not prepared  to give  its go ahead for  the entire  project. In 1981, 10 years after the ini tial authorization, the corps rejected  plans  to proceed with the Arkansas  project. Specifically, the corps found  that for every $1 spent on the project,  only 25 cents would be returned  in  benefits. This ratio was substantially  lower  than  the  required dollar-for dollar cost-to-benefit ratio. The corps  recommended tabling the project until  a significant change occurred which  ""clearly demonstrates a greater need  and probable use  of  the  improved  water."" This has yet to happen, and I  doubt  it ever will. Additionally,  the  ",1985

1792,752,22,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Reclaiming my  time, Mr. Speaker, let me make two  answers. First, I think the gentleman's  percentage  is probably off, and  the  reason I say that is that papers that  have been distributed today are trying  to  indicate  that  the base  that we  expose  in our plan  to cuts  is much  smaller than the base in the Gramm Rudman bill.  I think those papers and those state ments are incorrect.  ",1985
1793,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," If the gentleman will  yield  further,  could  the gentleman  give me the correct figure?  I under stand  these  figures  of  73  percent  larger  reduction  in  the programs  I  listed came from CBO. If the gentle man has another figure, could he give  it to the Members?  0 1750  ",1985
1794,752,22,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Well, I think the  figures came from CBO, they said, on  assumptions given  to CBO by Mem bers from the other side of the aisle.  Our belief, when you  take  into ac count prior year obligations in a way  that is fair, between the two plans, is  that under the House amendment we  have exempted outlays of $551 billion,  and under the Senate version of $488  billion. We do not believe there is any  great difference between what is ex posed to cutting in terms of the base  because we feel that we deal with prior  year obligations in the same way that  the Senate does, or if the Senate does  not deal with prior obligations, then  we do not either. We think that the  computation has not been correctly  done. We feel there is a very slight dif ference in the total of exempt outlays,  and we feel that the argument to the  contrary is simply not true.  ",1985
1795,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," Could I ask the gen tleman to yield further in that case to  simplify  this,  again  understanding  that these winners or these programs  that are exempted under Rostenkow ski are not going to be shedding the  same deficit reduction that other pro grams are, what is your figure with  regard to the rest of the pie that is   going to be taking the brunt of the  cuts.  ",1985
1796,752,22,Mr. GEPHARDT.," We believe  that  the exemptions we made in our pro posal over Gramm-Rudman only add  $11 billion or $12 billion of program  that is exempt, that is taken off the  table and not subjected to cuts, and  not nearly the amount that the gentle man suggests at 73 percent.  ",1985
1797,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," OK, for the gentle man's information, I would simply say  the gentleman that I understand CBO  calculated it at $50 billion.  ",1985
1798,752,22,Mr. GEPHARDT., I thank the gen tleman.  ,1985
1799,752,22,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Penn sylvania CMr. WALKER].  ",1985
1800,752,22,Mr. WALKER.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding. It is interesting we  now raise questions about CBO's fig ures when in fact under the proposal  we had on the floor  the other day,  CBO is given virtually carte blanche  authority to make all these decisions. I  find that rather interesting.  I think the important thing to real ize is that now what we have on the  House floor is a very doable, detailed  procedure which can lead us success fully to a balanced budget instead of  just  the conceptual outlay we had  dealt with in the original bill.  We have now spelled out specifically  how various programs should be treat ed under the sequestration procedures.  The  vague  definitions  that were  there previously have been scuttled in  favor of listing which programs are to  be singled out for exemption or special  treatment.  Treatment of prior year defense con tracts is clearly defined. New contracts  are specifically required to be seques tered.  Programs which are not susceptible  to the sequestering for legal or techni cal reasons have been singled out. We  have responded in this particular ap proach to the legitimate concern over  the impact of a recession or an eco nomic downturn, to the difficulty of  projecting economic cycle accurately.  We have said that if economic condi tions allow the growth to go below 1  percent, that at that point, the pro gram would no longer be effective. It  recognizes the constitutional problem  of leaving OMB and CBO to develop a  report which triggers the sequestering  process and instead gives  the Comp troller General the responslbillty for  reporting to the President and to the  Congress.  The amendment before us also rec ognizes that the original bill failed to  clarify the baseline arainst which the  budget deficit ls measured and rener ally adopts the House procedure for  doing that.  So,  in other words, what has hap pened is that we have been presented  with a program that has rone throurh  some fine-tuning. We do, in fact, have  a program that could be def ended, and  it seems to me that to break the lm  passe, to get beyond a lot of the argu ment about who is hurting whom and  how, that we ought to adopt this par ticular amendment and get on with  the process not only of doing the Na tion's business now but also get on  with the process of beginning to bal ance the books of the Federal Govern ment.  ",1985
1801,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1985
1802,752,22,Mr. WALKER., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1985
1803,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding, and I thank him for  his points.  I want to go back to the point that  was made by the gentleman from Mis souri. I have here-we have a differ ence of opinion, obviously, over  the  difference in cuts under Rostenkowski  and under Mack-Gramm.  I  have a  letter from Rudolph Penner that lays  out the difference, and he has it as a  difference under  the House amend ment and the Senate amendment as  being $348.4  billion  as opposed  to  $297.9 billion, which is about a $50 bil lion difference.  Turning to all  those programs be sides defense, this is not guns versus  butter, this is a lot of butter versus a  few programs that involve butter; the  Older Americans Program is going to  be cut $94 million as opposed to $11  million.  The SPEAKER. The  time of  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania CMr.  W ALKERl has expired.  ",1985
1804,752,22,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  additional minute  to  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania.  ",1985
1805,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman continue to yield?  ",1985
1806,752,22,Mr. WALKER., I yield to the gentle man from California.  ,1985
1807,752,22,Mr. HUNTER.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding.  Let me carry on: Under the Older  Americans Program, the difference be tween the Rostenkowski package and  the Mack-Gramm package is the dif ference between $94 million in reduc tion under Rostenkowski as opposed to  $11 million-excuse me, it is $22 mil lion as opposed to $11 million under  Mack-Gramm.  So there is a substantial dJfference.  Dislocated Workers,  there is a  large  difference; Job Corps, there is a large  dlff erence;  Indian Education, Head  Start, Compensatory Education, Low Income Energy Assistance, Subsidized  Housing  Programs,  Social  Services  Block Grant, a large difference.  So I would ask the gentleman if the  gentleman from Missouri has a differ ent figure from this $50 billion figure.  I would ask the gentleman from Mis souri if he could respond, I have the  letter from Mr. Penner that says there  is a $50 bill1on difference in reductions  among  these loser programs because  of  the winners  that were exempted  under Rostenkowski. Could  he  re spond?  I ask  the gentleman to give  him 1 minute to respond. I would ask  him to respond on his own time.  ",1985
1808,765,22,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, I ask unan imous consent that all Members may  have 5  legislative days  in which  to  revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my motion, and that I may  include extraneous materials with my  remarks.  The SPEAKER. Is  there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Florida?  There was no objection.  ",1985
1809,765,22,Mr. MACK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Wyo ming CMr. CHENEY] to close debate for  our side.  ",1985
1810,765,22,Mr. CHENEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think we have all  grown  tired of the debate. My con stituents are tired of the debate, and I  think the American people are tired of  the debate.  The charges have been made here  today that somehow  this package  is  unknown to the Congress. The fact is  that it was laid before the conference  on October 31  and printed  in  the  RECORD  last week. It has received far  more study than the package that the  Democrats passed overwhelmingly last  week and which showed up on  the  floor only at the moment of the vote.  With respect to the fairness charge,  it is clearly not fair to cut the budget  if we are going to exempt 71 percent  of the programs from those cuts. We  talk about hitting the budget in 1986,  and it is clear that the package that is  before us  today,  as passed by  the  Senate, does indeed begin the cuts in  1986. So we have heard a lot of phony  arguments offered today.  Mr. Speaker, what I want to speak  about is failure. I want to talk about  the failure of this institution and the  other body and the President of the  United States to come to grips with  what clearly is the most serious public policy problem of the year.  0 1840  I think it is important, and I would  like  to stress with my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, if I might,  that we really would like to work out a  bipartisan plan that has decent pros pects to work and we  think we have  done  it;  that  the program  that  is  before us  incorporates many of  the  proposals, worthy proposals that were  developed in the conference just last  week.  We have tried to allay the concerns  about fairness by excluding Social Se curity. We have wrestled with the con stitutional questions. We have includ ed GAO.  I  am personally  convinced,  based  upon the work that the American Law  Division has done at the Library -of  Congress, that this is indeed a consti tutional package.  We have added extensive limits on  Presidential power and authority  to  make it clear that this is not a surrep titious effort to transfer authority to  the President of the United States.  The bottom  line, Mr. Speaker,  is  that this bill puts the wood  to the  President and to the Congress; it will  force both institutions to respond and  make some of those difficult choices  that so far for a  long time we have  been able to avoid.  Always in the past we have come to  the table and had Congress take Social  Security off of the table. We have had  the President take defense off of the  table. We have had taxes taken off the  table. We have had the Democrats in  the House take off many of the do mestic programs. So that when we got  through, the only thing that was nego tiable was the deficit.  What this bill would do, Mr. Speak er, is make it clear that we no longer  have the option, be it the Congress or  the President, of financing continued  increases in programs by running up  the deficit.  Please, I would ask my colleagues,  after a lot of deliberation and serious  effort, support what is a sincere effort  time has ex on the part of the Republicans, a bi partisan effort on  the part of  the  Senate. to produce a meaningful bipar tisan program that will make it possi ble for us to carry out our foremost re sponsibility, to manage the fiscal af fairs of the Nation  in a  responsible  manner.  The SPEAKER. All  pired.  Without  objection,  the  previous  question is ordered on the preferential  motion.  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER. The question is on  the preferential motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida CMr. MACK].  The question was  taken; and  the  Speaker announced that the noes ap peared to have it.  ",1985

1812,778,22,Mr. STRANG.," I  man for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the  gentleman from Idaho, for having this  special order and I am most gratified  to hear that the State of Michigan has  become the next State to approve a  referendum to call for a constitutional  convention  to  call  for  a  balanced  budget. I believe that leaves one State  to go. Am I correct?  ",1985
1813,778,22,Mr. CRAIG.," If the house in Michi gan now approves this measure passed  by the Michigan State senate,  then,  yes, it would leave one more State to  go.  ",1985
1814,778,22,Mr.  STRANG.,"  I  have  to  say  ""Hurrah""  to  the State of Michigan  and hope that they have enough back bone  to carry through as a body  in  this  proposal,  because  as  a  new  Member of Congress,  this gentleman  arrived in Washington with an amend ment in his hand which he dropped  into  the hopper to off er a constitu tional  amendment  to  balance  the  budget.  I believe  that Jefferson meant  it  when he said we  should have  it.  I  know that this Congress has proved  that we  need  to  have  a  balanced  budget. I believe that our exercise in  discussing Gramm-Rudman and  the  Rostenkowski proposal has been an  exercise in attempting to come to grips  either  genuinely  or  disingenuously  with  the question of balancing  the  budget.  But I also know from past experi ence that this body passes laws, and it  can un-pass laws. So no matter what  we do with laws requiring us to bal ance  the budget,  the people of  the  United  States  expect  us  to  come  through with more  than that. As a  new Member, I realize that when the  Democratic majority in the House of  Representatives put forth a program  protecting certain areas of the budget,  they had necessarily to threaten other  parts of the budget, and I have to ask  some  rhetorical questions,  if  I may  have leave to do so.  When it came to agriculture and the  Democratic Party made some choices  in this body, on top of all the other  things  that  are  happening  to  the  American farmer. did they really mean  to add $577 million more in cuts from  aid  to agriculture  than  they would  have had under the $139 million avail able  to  them  as  a  choice  under  Gramm-Mack?  Did the Democratic House of Repre sentatives, did the leadership, have to  choose  to  cut  elderly  handicapped  housing by $49 million when they had  an opportunity under Gramm-Mack to  cut only $12 million?  Did the Democratic House of Repre sentatives, in its wisdom and its leader ship, really have to cut from the Job  Training Partnership Act $241 million  when,  in  fact,  under Gramm-Mack  they might have only cut $80 million?  Did this House have to cut from the  Job Corps $50 million when, in fact,  they were offered the opportunity to  cut $12 million?  In compensatory education, did this  House have to stand up and cut $304  million when, in fact, under Gramm Mack they could have cut $51 million?  Handicapped  education: Did  this  House have to cut $109 million from  handicapped education when, in fact,  they had the opportunity to vote for  Gramm-Mack which offered cuts of  $25 million?  My friends, this is a litany of choice  which I, for one, have to ask: Is this  the prudent way to do it? Is this the  way you start the cuts when you are  going through a series of quarters of  relatively slow growth in this country?  Is  that when you put  the hammer  down?  Severability. My  colleagues  talked  about severability. Severability, in es sence,  is  simply a prudent measure  which every  legislative body  in  this  country uses  to protect  the public  from having the good parts of legisla tion thrown out with parts that may  be imperfect, so we do not throw out,  if you will,  the baby with the bath  water. Every State legislature does it.  This Congress does  it. Anybody who  would put forth a piece of legislation  and take out the severability clause is  engaging in an act of cynical assassina tion on that bill that is as evident to  its author as it is to all the rest of us.

1815,778,22,Mr. CRAIG.," Let me thank my col league, the gentleman from Colorado,  for those observations.  Last weekend I was home in my dis trict speaking to a group of farmers,  and  they were concerned about  the  farm bill  that had  just passed  the  House  and  now working  its way  through  the other body. They said,  ""How does that program, or that idea,  or that-"" and finally I said, ""You are  talking about the Rostenkowski bal anced budget-debt limitation measure  we  passed  out  of  the House  last  night."" This happened to be on Friday  when we took that action and I was in  my district on Saturday.  They said, ""Yes.""  I said, ""Well, I will tell you how it  comes down. You lose and everybody  else wins  because  that  alternative  which I opposed decided to divide an  awful lot of issues and it cannot speak  to  fairness  and  equity  across  the  board.""  I know I have been consistently told  by my constituents, ""You can cut the  budget and we want you to do it. In  fact, we ask you  to do  it. But do  it  fairly, equitably. and across the board.  Treat all programs alike and then we  can accept it because we know that if  we are benefiting from a program and  we are going to take a reduction, some body else is going to, also.""  But, of course, that is not the way  that program came about.  the  ",1985

1817,778,22,Mr. CRAIG.," I would be more than  happy to yield  to my colleague,  the  gentleman from Florida.  ",1985
1818,778,22,Mr. MACK.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  let me Just kind of  build on what  the gentleman  from  Colorado was saying, to attempt to ex plain why  one program would  see  much larger cuts than the other one  under the two proposals.  The significant difference really  is  because of two things. One was that  the Democrats desired to get to $161  billion in the first year and, by the  way,  that figure was arrived at be cause, again, they felt that the $180  billion  that we had established was  done for the purpose of avoiding any  sequestering  action  during  1986.  Again,  I  think anybody who knows  and has any understanding of  the  spending patterns of the Nation and  the economic  flow of  things knows  dam good and well that the deficit is  going to be large enough this year to  require a sequestering order to go into  effect under the plan passed by the  Senate.  The other thing that requires such a  larger hit in a number of other pro grams  is because clearly, when you  make the decision to exempt some pro grams, it means that someone else has  to pick up the slack. What has hap pened in the Democrat alternative, or  the Rostenkowski  deficit  reduction  plan I guess as it is known,  is  that  there are nine programs  that have  been added to the exempt list, totally  exempt, not put in category I where  you can only  reduce  the automatic  cost-of-living adjustments and bring  those down to zero. These nine pro grams are moved totally out of this  proposal.  is  D 2035  In addition to that, the Democratic  plan takes the Medicare Progr~. that  portion which  is  not  affected  by  COLA's, which is about 97 percent of  the program, and moves all of those  funds from category II to category I  whereby  the end conclusion  that  only 3 percent of the Medicare dollars  are impacted by COLA adjustments.  ",1985
1819,778,22,Mr. CRAIG., Category II is the non exempt?  ,1985
1820,778,22,Mr. MACK.," There are actually three  categories. There is the exempt cate gory. Category I are those programs  that have automatic cost-of-living ad justments, a COLA, as some people  ref er to it, and category II are what we  call  the  controllable  accounts,  and  that is supposed to be everything else.  The difference between the two pro posals is that roughly, under our pro posal, that is the Republican alterna tive in the House, there are approxi mately $490 billion in those funds or  ",1985
1821,791,22,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Ohio [Mr. PEASE]  is rec ognized for 60 minutes.  ",1985
1822,791,22,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to bring to the attention of my  colleagues in the House a situation re garding a young man, a sailor by the  name of Medvid who  twice  tried  to  escape from a Soviet ship in the Mis sissippi River near New Orleans.  That ship was in the harbor in order  to collect grain and take it back to the  Soviet Union. While the ship was wait ing in the harbor,  this young sailor  jumped overboard, 30  feet  into  the  Mississippi, swam ashore, in order to  escape into freedom, if you will.  He was returned to the ship not once  but twice by our Immigration and Nat uralization Service. It is rather clear  now, after the event is over, that the  event was mishandled by the Immigra tion and Naturalization Service, and  also by the State Department. We do  not know why the situation was mis handled, but we are confident that it  was.  We are concerned that perhaps the  Immigration and Naturalization Serv ice, perhaps  the State Department,  was more  concerned  about keeping  amicable  relations with  the Soviet  Union on the eve of the summit be tween Mr. Gorbachev and President  Reagan than it was with the human  rights, with the freedom of this young  Soviet sailor of Ukrainian descent.  I must say that if that was the moti vation, if that sort of bureaucratic rea soning went  into  the decisions  that  were made to return sailor Medvid to  his ship, those considerations have not  been adopted by the American people;  by Ukrainian Americans in particular  and even more particularly by those in  the United States, including one of my  own  constituents who  believe  that  they may be  related  to  this young  sailor.  0 2100  They have kept the situation alive.  They have done everything in their  power  to get  their Government  to  review the decision which forced this  young sailor back to his ship.  I would like to take a few minutes to  review the events that have happened  in only the last 5 days regarding this  case.  It was last Thursday, I believe, that  Mr. Medvid was returned to his ship  after having allegedly signed as state ment for the INS that he wished to  return to his home country.  But then the next mornin1, the in terpreter who is working for the State  Department and INS who did the in terpreting between the U.S. officials  and the sailor said that it was her feel ing that he had categorically said that  he wished to stay in the United States  and to have asylum here.  That revelation by  the  interpreter  caused a lot of concern on the part of  a  lot of Americans  including myself  and one of our colleagues, Representa from  the neighboring  19th Congressional District in Ohio.  Accordingly, because of the confu sion, Mr. FEIGHAN and I sent a  tele gram to President Reagan on Friday  afternoon asking that the case be re opened on behalf of this young sailor.  We have not heard an answer, I must  tive FEIGHAN,  say, from the White House. The White  House acknowledged on Monday that  it had received a  telegram, said that  we would receive in due course a reply;  not, to my way of thinking, a very ex peditious  answer  from  the White  House.  We were told, however, by the State  Department that any hope of getting  Mr. Medvid off  the ship where he  could be interviewed by United States  officials  would  have  to  be  done  through Soviet officials here  in  the  United States.  So on Monday, Mr. FEIGHAN and I  dispatched a letter to Ambassador Do brynin making an appeal to him that  Soviet officials arrange to have sailor  Medvid removed from the ship, again  put  in  the  custody of  the United  States officials so that he could make  a decision and we could make certain  in our own minds that he really did  either wish  to  stay  in  the United  States or wish to return to his home  country.  A very  interesting revelation came  up over the weekend, and that is that  three women,  a mother  and  two  daughters who are grown women,  in  my district and Mr. FEIGHAN's district  believe that they may well be related,  may be cousins of this young sailor.  They have  the same  family name,  they come from the same area of the  Ukraine that the sailor is from, and  that  family,  Joined  by Ukrainian  Americans all across the country, have  been engaged in the last 4 or 5 days in  a heroic effort to see to it that this  sailor's rights are fully protected and  that this land of America, the home of  the free and  the brave,  the Nation  which has always welcomed  the op pressed  from other  countries,  does  what is right by sailor Medvid.  That family went down to New Orle ans on Monday to see what they could  do about getting out to the ship. They  actually  formed  a  flotilla of  small  boats, went out to the Russian ship on  Tuesday, and sought permission to go  aboard and talk with the young sailor.  They were denied.  At the same time, Ukrainian-Ameri can lawyers went into court here in  Washington to seek permission or to  seek an order from the court to keep  the  Soviet  ship  in United  States  waters and to get the sailor off that  ship so that he could be interviewed  by United States officials.  That court decision was not favor able to the plaintiffs, and, again, this  morning we were  in touch with my  constituent, Mrs. Mary Filipovich of  Wadsworth, OH, and they were trying  a different tack, going into the local  Federal court in New Orleans.  I have not yet heard the result of  that appearance. In the meantime, Mr.  Speaker, other things are happening.  A hearing was held yesterday in the  Subcommittee on Immigration in the  ",1985
1823,804,22,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Speaker, over  the  last 7 years I have become quite involved  with  the  immigration  reform  i11ue as a  member of the Judiciary Committee's SubNovember 6, 1985  committee on Immigration, Refugees, and  International Law. When  initial Federal  legislation  to  address  the  immigration  problem surfaced in 1972 and 1973 it was  piecemeal in nature. Since that time it has  become evident that the broad nature of  the problem  requires a  solution with an  equally  comprehensive  scope.  Elements  that make up an immigration reform bill  must be crafted  to work  in concert with  each other. If we are going to demagnetize  the attraction of unlawful employment in  the United States, we must have sanctions  with respect to employers who knowingly  hire those who come here without benefit  of papers.  At the same time if we have sanctions, we  must not put those who have developed a  dependency on undocumented labor in the  position of intentionally violating the law  or going out of business if they are unable  to find a sufficient level of domestic labor.  We must have a workable temporary For eign Worker Program for agriculture that  is regulated to protect the rights of Ameri can workers as well as those who partici  pate in the program.  The argument is being voiced by  those  who are opposed to an organized Agricul tural Guest Worker Program that Califor nia growers are simply looking for a plenti ful supply of cheap labor. However, that ar gument is ignoring the reality of the status  quo.  Former  INS Commissioner Leonel  Castillo best characterized the current situ  ation in stating that:  The U.S. is experiencing the world's larg est temporary worker program, larger than  the guest worker programs in France, Hol land and Germany. Only ours is unregulat ed . . . resulting in the Immigration Service  having to arrest over a million persons an nually . . . whose crime is that they want to  work in this country.  I urge my colleagues to read the follow ing article which appeared in the Washing ton Post on October 31. This article reveals  the plight of the California grower with a  small operation, and why many of them  can't use  thousands of  the unemployed  workers available. Also, it is pointed out by  the reporter that wrote this article, current ly workers have no protection under the  law and that some growers have housed mi  grant workers in caves and paid less than  minimum wage.  The article reads as follows:  CALIFORNIA GROWERS LoOK TO CONGRESS l'OR  PICKERS  l'OREIGN GUEST WORKER PROVISION BACKED  <By Jay Mathews>  Fu:sNo, CA.-When members of Congress  and  labor  leaders ask Harry Kubo why  Fresno arowers need more Mexican laborers  to pick their raisins and strawberries, when  they ask why can't he use the thousands of  unemployed workers already here, he tells  this story:  One day last summer a member of the  Nisei Farmers League, the growers group of  which Kubo ls president, asked if he could  find 30 workers to pick 20 acres of grapes  for raisins when they ripened in a month.  Kubo called Doreen Caetano, a job develop er for a local community of Laotian immi grants, who said it could be done.  ",1985
1824,817,22,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, recently  the Akron Beacon Journal contained an  outstanding letter to the editor by one of  my constituents, Maxwell Klayman, on the  need to recognize that pollution of our en vironment is a global problem that surpass es even the ability of national governments  to  control. While  national  governments  have an important, and, indeed, an essen tial role, international cooperation is also  needed.  For example, Mr. Klayman pointed out  that  if the shallow waters of the ocean  become so polluted  that plankton cannot  survive,  the Earth's oxygen supply could  become insufficient to support life. It is al ready well known that acid rain and pesti cide pollution is carried across all national  boundaries and requires some sort of inter national agreement, if it is to be brought  under control.  To this end, the United Nation's Environ mental Program CUNEP] is expected to de velop guidelines to prevent ocean and at mospheric pollution. Unfortunately, fund  ing is far too modest so far to perform this  task. The Reagan  administration earlier  this year attempted to impose a 75-percent  cut in the modest $10 million a year the  United States contributes to UNEP. Fortu nately, Congress insisted on continuing the  funding at last year's level. However, the  same problem may arise  in next year's  budget. It is e11ential that Congre11 realize  that the continuation of a  livable environ  ment is not a  luxury, which can safely be  discarded.  The full text of Mr. Klayman'   lows these remarks:  CFrom the Akron Beacon Journal, Oct. 2,  1985]  letter fol  WORLDWIDE EnORT NDDl!D To P'IOHT  POLLUTION EITl!CTIVl!I. Y  ""No  country,  not  even  a U.S.S.R.  or  U.S.A., can be an environmental fortress,""  says Mustafa K. Tolba, executive director of  the United Nations Environmental Pro  gram.  The life-support systems of the Earth are  under assault from pollution caused by in  dustrialization,  population  pressures  and  new  chemical  and  nuclear  technoloaies.  While the public has berun to reco1111ze the  need to stem thil tide of pollution, many  people still think a clean environment can  be assured by  their national aovernment.  They fan to understand that only an eff ec  tive organization can adequately protect us.  The  reason  simple: Pollutants cross  oceans, travel great diatances, cross national  la  30931  boundaries and severely  impact on  living  conditions in other countries. Far worse, cu mulatively such pollutants may bring about  irreversible changes that could eventually  rob us of life-sustaining oxygen or alter the  Earth's climate, making our planet inhospit able to human survival.  Consider these facts:  Acid  rain  formed  from  nitrogen-oxide  emissions spewing out of U.S. smokestacks  falls on Canadian lakes, killing the fish and  denuding surrounding forests.  Sweden documented acid rain's deadly ef fects in the 1970s and spent huge sums to  clean up  its own  industrial sources, but  Swedish lakes are still fouled by acid rain  caused by emissions from the Ruhr Valley  and Great Britain, where controls weren't  enacted.  Scientists fear the ozone layer may be de  pleted by cumulative emissions from aerosol  spray cans, refrigerants, nitrogen fertilizers  and  the  jet burn from supersonic  trans ports, but only Sweden and  the United  States have banned or controlled aerosol  sprays.  The United States also aborted develop ment of supersonic transports, in part be cause of the ozone controversy, but France  and Britain launched their SST, the Con corde, anyway.  Carbon  dioxide  and  ozone-depleting  chemicals are increasing at rates that may  alter the world's upper atmosphere and cli mate, causing partial melting of the polar  ice  caps  and  catastrophic  flooding  that  could wipe out coastal cities.  Each year an area of crop and grassland  as  large as Maine becomes barren waste land, while areas of forest equal to half the  size of California disappear.  DDT sprayed in East Africa ends up in the  Bay of Bengal, 4,000 miles away; 18 billion  cubic meters of liquid pollution now into  the Atlantic  yearly  from French  rivers  alone; an oil spill off Mexico's coast fouls  the coast of Texas, 500 miles distant; PCBs  dumped in New York's Hudson River in the  1970s are still adversely affecting ocean or ganisms.  If the shallow waters of the continental  shelves become so polluted that plankton  cannot survive, Thor Heyerdal warns  the  Earth's oxygen supply would become insuf ficient to support life. He points out that  half of the world's oxygen ii produced by  plankton. Many species of filh are also de pendent on plankton for food.  The present United Nations Environmen tal Program was created to plan, coordinate  and play a catalytic role in protecting the  alobal environment.  While some progress has been made in  monitoring ocean and atmosphere pollution,  the United Nations itself concedes that not  enouah of UNEP's action plan has been im  plemented. The problem ii lack of author ity, as shown by this typical case:  UNEP got all the nations on the coast of  the Mediterranean to Jointly monitor pollu tion, and to restrict dumping of toxic pollut ants from ships, but couldn't get them to set  uniform standards for land-based pollution,  the source of three-fourths of the problem.  Since the bulk of thil pollution comes from  Italy, France and Spain, the southern coun tries balked at installing the same expensive  pollution controls. Italy, France and Spain  refused to act alone. Total cost was estimat  ed at $10 billion, less than the world spends  in one week on armaments.  Clearly, to adequately protect the Earth's  life-suppart systems, UNEP should be given  the authority to:  ",1985
1825,830,22,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  feel compelled to correct some of the major  misconceptions about H.R. 1616, the Labor Management Notification and Consultation  Act, which arose during a special order on  Friday, November 1.  H.R. 1616 is designed to address specific,  limited objectives. By requiring employers  to provide, whenever possible, 90 days' ad vance notice of permanent mass  layoffs  and plant closings affecting 50 or more em ployees, H.R. 1616 would prevent sudden  closures and cutbacks that take employees  by  surprise, handicap  the State employ ment services and agencies created to assist  dislocated workers, and frustrate attempts  by  local governments  and  employees  to  find alternatives that will save jobs.  After 11 years of House and Senate hear ings which have established beyond any  reasonable doubt  the benefits of advance  notice, the authors and cosponsors of H.R.  1616 reject the notion that this issue needs  more study.  I  ref er my colleagues  to  the  report on  H.R. 1616 for a brief overview of the evi dence supporting  the notice  requirement,  but one study in particular deserves men tion. A detailed review of 10 years of plant  closings has shown that employer compli ance with H.R. 1616's notice  requirement  will significantly reduce the unemployment  that results from plant closures and mass  layoffs and will save taxpayers hundreds of  millions of dollars in unemployment com pensation and other costs.  Yet  the  bill's  flexible,  relatively  brief  notice period will not burden any responsi ble business. Certainly, H.R. 1616 is not in tended to, as was suggested last Friday, and  will not, prohibit or eliminate plant clos ings.  Contrary to assertions made on Friday,  H.R. 1616, as reported, does not give  the  Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  any enforcement role. Nothing in  the bill  would require an employer to seek permis sion  from  the FMCS,  the Secretary of  Labor, or any other Government agency  before closing a plant or laying off work ers, even  if unavoidable business circum stances forced the employer to lay off em ployees without giving  the otherwise  re quired notice.  The consultation provisions of the bill  are designed to assure an opportunity for  the employer and  the employees, through  their union,  to explore alternatives  to a  proposed closing or mass layoff. The spon sors of H.R. 1616 believe  that American  workers deserve the right to participate in  and influence decisions that will have a tre mendous  impact on  their  lives. Given an  opportunity, employees can sometimes find  productivity  improvements and cost  sav ings that elude even the best-equipped manEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  agers. Unprofitable operations have been  turned around and thousands of jobs have  been  saved when  employees were given  enough time and information to develop al ternatives  to management decisions  that  would have eliminated their jobs.  H.R. 1616 would not alter management's  ultimate right to change its operations; the  employer would  have no duty  to  reach  agreement  or  to meet with  employees  beyond the 90 day notice period. But the  employees would be assured of a forum for  bringing  their  ideas before  the employer  for  its good  faith consideration. Even  in  cases where no mutually acceptable alter native could be found, the employees would  have the dignity of a detailed explanation  for  the elimination of their jobs and  the  knowledge that their proposals were taken  seriously.  In his speech to the AFL-CIO on October  30,  Secretary  of Labor Brock  praised  ""union-management  programs  that  give  workers greater participation  in  the deci sion-making process."" Obviously, no work place decision  is more  important for em ployees than whether or not their jobs will  be eliminated. H.R. 1616 would make em ployee  involvement  in  such  decisions  a  normal  part of union-management  rela tions.  Statements made during Friday's special  order on H.R. 1616 suggested that an em ployer who  refused  to comply with  the  bill's minimal requirements would be sub ject to criminal penalties. Nothing could be  farther from the truth. Such penalties have  never been part of the bill, and no amend ment to create such penalties has been of  fered or proposed.  I urge Members to read the report of the  Committee on Education and Labor on  H.R. 1616, House Report 99-336, and  the  bill itself. Mr. Speaker, I am confident my  colleagues will agree  that H.R. 1616  is a  reasonable, well-balanced bill that will help  to mitigate some of the serious problems  faced by dislocated workers and communi ties affected by mass layoffs and plant clos ings.  NURSING  HOME  ABUSES  BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION  OF CONGRESS  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 6, 1985  ",1985
1826,830,22,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today  to  commend my  colleague  from  New  Jersey, Congressman BOB TORRICELLI  for  his vigorous efforts to protect the quality  of life of our elderly citizens. The following  article from the Record newspaper in New  Jersey was prompted by Congressman TOR  RICELLl's concern about questions  rising  from  the  investigation of nursing home  care in his Bergen County, NJ, area.  Without Congressman TORRICELLl's per severence and concern  it  is unlikely that  the issue would have received the wide atNovember 6, 1985  tention which it did. I commend the article  to all of my colleagues.  The article follows:  [From the Record <NJ>. Oct. 14, 1985]  NURSING-HOME SLEUTHS-INVESTIGATORS ARE  NEEDED To WATCH OuT FoR BAD Guys  <By Bruce Locklin and Gale Scott>  For two years the Institute of Medicine  has been commissioning research papers for  the federal government on how to improve  the nation's nursing homes. In the piles of  words and statistics, a conclusion jumps out:  Bad nursing-home operators will continue  to neglect patients until they become con vinced  that government has a  system  in  place that will uncover neglect-and until  punishments are stiff enough that no one  wants to face them.  The bad guys have to know that they'll  get caught and punished severely. But in  New Jersey and most of the nation no one is  actively chasing them.  The traditional approach to nursing-home  enforcement  relies  on  inspectors,  people  trained in measuring a home against estab lished standards. There are several types of  inspectors: nurses, nutritionists, sanitarians.  They're visitors with checklists. They usual ly can determine  if a home  is complying  with regulations, but they don't have any  training in collecting evidence of wrongdo ing. They've never been instructed on how  to find or interview witnesses.  Inspectors simply don't have the tools to  cope with a corrupt nuring-home operator  who fakes records and intimidates staff and  patients.  New  Jersey's Health Commissioner,  Jr.  Richard Goldstein knows that his troops are  not up to the task of building cases against  bad homes.  ""We are not in the testimony-taking busi ness,"" Goldstein said in an inverview. ""We  are in the direct-inspecting business.""  What New Jersey and most other states  need  is  an effective  investigating agency  that will catch enough bad guys to scare the  hell out of the rest.  Referring nursing-home cases to existing  prosecuting  agencies  doesn't work.  Jack  Fay, New Jersey's former nursing-home om budsman, tried unsuccessfully for years to  get county prosecutors excited about ne glect-and-abuse cases. The prosecutors were  polite but not  really  interested, and Fay  became convinced that they saw their duty  as  chasing  ""real  criminals"" -murderers,  thieves, and the rest.  The  enforcement  vacuum  in  nursing  homes across  the country  is  astonishing,  particularly because it's easy to prove that a  bad nursing home is a bad nursing home.  The practical experience of investigating  the two Bel Air Manor nursing homes  in  New Jersey for The Record has given us  some insight into what it takes to expose  nursing-home wrongdoing.  We're not nursing-home experts or policy  planners. But as reporters who spent seven  months building evidence of nursing-home  neglect, we  think we may have  found a  methodology  that any state could use  to  clear up its nursing homes and make sure  they stay cleaned up.  The approach we're suggesting is similar  to what the Justice Department did several  years ago, when it decided to pursue mob  figures with the strike-force concept, setting  up an agency designed to go out and find  evidence.

1827,843,22,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to introduce today a joint resolution of the  Congress  designating March  2  through  March 8, 1986, as ""National Back Aware ness Week."" Provided that this resolution  meets with the approval of both bodies of  the Congress  and  the President of  the  United States, it will call upon all Govern ment agencies and the people of the Nation  to observe this week with appropriate pro grams and activities.  At any given time, some 75 million Amer icans suffer with back pain. The elderly are  particularly vulnerable to this lncapacitat  ing ailment.  According to the American Back Society,  more than 400,000 people injure their backs  on  the job yearly, and  the average back  injury results in 97 lost work days; $14 bll  lion is spent on the treatment and compen  sation of back injury each year, and 8 out  of 1 O Americans will experience back pain  at some point in their lives.  Exercise, performed  judiciously and as  prescribed by a health professional, can  have a beneficial effect. Proper posture can  provide relief for back pain. Patients can  be  taught  to avoid movements  that can  injure the back. Certain ways of managing  stress can reduce strain on the back, and  proper nutrition appears to bring relief in  certain individuals.  I believe that National Back Awareness  Week can be an  important step  toward  bringing care of the back into the public  consciousness. We need  to mobilize those  interested  in back disorders,  in order to  educate the public and the health care com munity as to the seriousness of back prob lems. Orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons,  physical therapists, radiologists, chiroprac tors,  exercise  physiologists,  neurologists,  nurses-these are but a few of the profes sions for whom care of the back is an im portant  concern. By  enacting National  Back Awareness Week, we will be able to  provide these persons and their patients and all other interested persons-informa tion relative to the treatment, prevention,  and control of disorders associated with  the back.  I would  like to  thank Dr. David Lehr man, a respected surgeon and constituent  of mine from Miami Beach, FL, for bring ing to my attention  information on back  problems. Dr. Lehrman has been especially  active trying to educate Americans regard ing back pain and how to relieve it.  Back pain has reached epidemic propor tions and has become a major public health  threat to the life and economy of our coun try.

1836,856,22,Mr. ROYBAL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may require.  Mr. Speaker,  the  conferees  have  reached agreement on the Treasury,  Postal Service, and General Govern ment appropriations bill for fiscal year  1986. This conference report provides  $13.2 bllllon in recommended appro priations for fiscal year 1986. While  this ls an increase of $951 mlllion over  the President's budget, primarily due  to the amount included for the Postal  Service,  it  ls $84 mlllion under the  House-passed bill. The amount recom mended ls also $323,625,000 below the  302  allocation to this subcommittee under  section  of  the  Congressional  Budget Act.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to point out  that the amount recommended by the  conferees for fiscal year 1986 ls $215  mlllion below  the amount appropri ated for discretionary items for fiscal  year 1985. As Members all know, the  committee has no control over manda tory items.  The conference  report before you  today ls unde:o the House-passed bill  but I believe that funding for the vari ous actlvlties provided for in this bill  are at levels that the House can fully  support.  I am particularly pleased to inform  the chairman of the Committee on  Ways and Means and the chairman of  the Committee on Government Oper atiom that the House conferees were  able to keep faith with those commit tees by deleting legislative provisions  which were  included  in  the Senate passed bill.

1839,869,22,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I  intend  to  vote for this conference report. Though the  funding  is above  the President's request,  the difference lies mainly in three impor tant areas that I believe need the level set  by the conferees.  While the Congress is debating trade and  tax reform, the administration is request ing inadequate funding for both the IRS  and the Customs Service. A report just this  week indicated that voluntary tax compli ance is down. While this is surely due in  part to frustration with the current code, it  occurs to me that it just might also be be cause enforcement  is being neglected.  In  fact,  the administration had proposed  to  cut over 1,000 position:.J from the IRS. This  report provides  for 1,800  additional  IRS  staff positions. The first step toward a fair  tax is one that is equally enforced and that  can only be accomplished with adequate  staff.  The same can be said for the Customs  Service. The adminstration has repeatedly  told us existing trade laws can address the  threat of imports. Americans, particularly  in the textile industry in my district, are  losing jobs because imports are pouring in.  The House has passed legislation to protect  these jobs, but the administration opposes  that effort saying agreements are already  in place. Those agreements are meaningless  if they are not enforced and they cannot be  enforced without Customs Service person nel. This administration had proposed a cut  of 887 positions. That prospect is stagger ing. The Government Operations Commit tee has reviewed the enforcement of textile  and apparel import quotas and has found  that, despite an elaborate system of inter ndional agreements, the U.S. has failed to  prevent import disruption of its domestic  markets. Further, we have failed  to stop  the evasion of those agreements. Because  of increasing workloads and staff short ages, the Service is unable to prevent viola tions of the restraint system causing seri ous injury to the domestic textile industry.  We need to increase, not decrease, our Cus toms Service staff. They produce revenue,  $21.06  for  every  appropriated dollar  in  1984. I'm extremely pleased that this report  provides 473 positions, bringing the total to  over 14,000.  I urge  the adoption of the  report and  would call on the President to see the con sistency of his policies in it.  ",1985
1840,869,22,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank the conferees of the Appropriations  Committees of the House and the Senate  for  including language in their report on  Treasury, Postal Service and general Gov ernment a!)propriations  indicating  to  the  Customs Service  that additional customs  positions should be assigned  to  the San  Francisco district. Under the leadership of  Representative  ROYBAL  and  Senator  ABDNOR, the conference committee took an  important step in helping the bay area cus toms office obtain some of the additional  staff positions which  they so desperately  need  to keep up with  the ever-increasing  amounts of customs work in the area. I ap preciate my colleagues' help.  I would like to urge the Customs Service  to follow the suggestion of the appropria tions conferees and assign sufficient addi tional staffers to satisfy the needs of the  bay area customs office.  ",1985
1841,869,22,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in op position to the conference report.  When an appropriations bill goes to con ference, it is understood that some compro mise must be made. This conference, how ever, appears to have caved in completely.  The House bill was at $13.2 billion. The  Senate bill was at $12.9 billion. Conferees  bravely agreed  to hold  the  line at a  full  $13.2 billion.  Even the House's one money-saving pro vision, a modest reduction of 2.65 percent  from  a  few  programs aimed at coming  close to the House budget target, fell by the  wayside  in conference. The only savings  contained in this report is a 14-percent cut  in the Postal Service's Federal funding.  Mr. Speaker, our budget crisis is real. We  can no  longer accept  loose controls on  spending such as those contained  in this  report. I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting against  the conference  report on  H.R. 3036.  Mr. DORGAN  of North Dakota. Mr.  Speaker, one of the best ways to reduce the  Federal deficit is to collect taxes owed. Yet,  the adminis!ration's current policy of cut ting  funds  for  Internal Revenue Service  and Customs Service enforcement and col lection would stand this truism on its head.  The IRS recently reported $8.5 billion in  active delinquent accounts, with accounts  receivable  totaling $30 billion. Altogether  we face a tax gap of some $90 billion this  year, an amount representing the total of  uncollected revenues from only legitimate  businesses.  When the IRS spends a buck on tax en forcement, it gets 5 in return. Nonetheless,  in a time of $200 billion deficits and nearly  half that in uncollected revenues, the White  House proposed to cut the IRS work force  by 1,254 positions. Fortunately, the confer ees on  the Treasury appropriations bill  have rejected  this upside-down  logic and  increased IRS and Customs staff by about  1,800 and 600 workers, respectively.  A  recent Government Operations Sub committee  investigation by our colleague,  Representative DOUG  BARNARD,  showed  why weaker IRS enforcement is not only  bad tax policy but an invitation for more  ""dirty money""  laundering and drug dealing, too. I include an article on this study  and urge my colleagues to support fair and  effective enforcement by the IRS. Our law abiding taxpayers deserve no less. (Article  follows from the November 5, 1985 Wash ington Post.)  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 5, 19851  IRS SEEN AS LAx ON CASH TRANSFERS  <By Kathy Sawyer>  In the world of ""dirty money, ""public at tention has focused on the need for better  policing of big banks. Now congressional in vestigators are looking at another villain The Internal Revenue Service.  The Treasury Department has fined six  banks this year for failure to fulfill report ing requirements that could tip authorities  to large-scale money  laundering linked to  drug trafficking and other crimes.  But House investigators now say one of  Treasury's own-the IRS-has left open a  convenient  secondary  money-laundering  route and has failed to use its legal author ity to develop criminal investigations in the  area.  Under the Bank Secrecy Act, the IRS is  responsible for assuring that thousands of  ""secondary financial institutions"" -such as  check-cashing facilities,  finance companies  and precious metal or coin dealers-report  all transactions of more than $10,000.  But  the  agency  ""continues  to  devote  grossly  insufficient resources""  to the task  ""and its efforts lack coordination and con sistency,"" Rep. Doug Barnard, Jr. <D-GA.), a  Government  Operations  subcommittee  chairman, wrote  to  IRS Commissioner  Roscoe L. Egger, Jr.  ""At the current  level of resources and  commitment, the currency transactions re porting program cannot succeed in meeting  its intended purposes of detecting criminal  activity and unreported income in the un derground economy,"" Barnard said  in an  Oct. 25 letter.  Subcommittee investigators found that by  December 1984, the IRS had identified only  3.014 of an estimated 15,000 businesses in volve in such transactions.  They also found that the agency conduct ed only 644 compliance checks at such busi nesses  in 1984,  less  than one-third  the  number made in 1981.  Accurate reports on large cash  transac tions can be useful  in criminal  investiga tions-as demonstrated by a 1982  internal  IRS eudit obtained by the subcommittee, an  investigator said.  In samplings of two IRS districts-Cincin nati and Louisville-where about 5,000 cur rency  transaction reports were filed from  1976 to 1980, the report found 42 persons in volved  in  three or more  transactions. Of  these, 10 individuals involved in 57 transac tions totaling $1.3 million had no record of  ever filing tax returns.  One individual who had filed a tax return  in 1980 had 27 currency transactions in 1980  totaling $1.2 million, yet had reported an  adjusted gross income of only $2,295. This  person also had a number of large transac tions in 1978 and reported a small income  then. For others with large transactions re ported income of less than $10,000 on their  1980 tax returns.  Five  in the group had criminal records  and two were under investigation for narcot ics violations. But officials had made no use  or minimal use of the transaction reports to  develop  criminal  investigations,  auditors  found.  ",1985
1842,921,22,Mr. NICKLES.," Would the chairman  of the subcommittee clarify his posi tion  on  three Oklahoma  projects  which were added  in  the House?  I  know that the Senate did not include  any add-ons in their authorization bill,  but I believe that the projects may be  authorized. I hope that the chairman  can assure me that these projects will  be supported in the conference on his  bill.  The projects are as follows:  First, production facility at McAles ter Army Depot, $2.3 million.  Second, mission  support  facility,  Vance Air Force Base, $3.5 million.  Third, Lexington, OK, Army Nation al Board storage facility, $7.2 million.  ",1985
1843,921,22,Mr. MATTINGLY.," I can assure the  Senator  from Oklahoma  that  I  am  aware of these projects, and I will do  every  thing  I  can  to  project  his  projects, if authorized, during the ap propriation conference.  ",1985
1844,921,22,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I want  to thank my good friends from Geor gia and Tennessee for  their tremen dous effort on this year's military con struction  appropriations  bill.  I  am  aware of the difficulties to obtain the  necessary cuts to meet the 1986 budget  resolution.  I have just received word that the  military  construction  authorization  conference,  finished  yesterday,  in cludes  three projects  in Oklahoma  which are not in this bill because of  the lack of authorization at the time  of markup.  The projects  for Vance Air Force  Base, where one-fifth of all USAF  pilots are trained, is the mission sup port  complex,  long  neede1, which  would consolidate functions now locat ed all over the base including six 40year-old wooden buildings. The cost of  this construction is $3.550 million.  Another project is the base supply  administration  facility, at a  cost of  $1.9 million, to provide work space for  the admL'listrative, clerical, inventory  management, and many other func tions now located in warehouse space.  This warehouse space is badly needed  for adequate protection and proper  storage of aircraft spares.  The third project, now authorized in  this year's conference, is $2.3 million  for a new building with special safety  features necessary for the renovation  to the PBX bomb loading production  line at the Army ammunition plant lo cated in McAlester, OK.  I would appreciate serious consider ation  by my  colleagues  that  the  Senate recede to the House on these  projects during the conference on the  fiscal year 1986 military construction  appropriations.

1856,921,22,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  At the appropriate place in the bill, add  the following:  The Senate find that the U.S. has histori cally been a haven for those seeking refuge  from repression; and  recent events have focused on the proce dures used in handling cases involving for eign merchant seamen who might seek po litical asylum; and  serious questions have arisen about the  application of those procedures by the INS  in the case of Miroslav Medvid.  Therefore,  It is the sense of the Senate  that all legal and legitimate means should  be taken by the U.S. government in arriving  at a just resolution of this incident.  ",1985
1857,921,22,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President,  the amendment  that I  send  to  the  desk on behalf of myself and the dis tinguished  ranking member of  the  subcommittee,  Senator  SASSER,  ex presses the sense of the Senate that  the U.S. Government should take all  legal and legitimate means necessary  to  insure  that a  just  resolution  is  reached in the matter involving the  Soviet seaman who has apparently at tempted to leave his ship now docked  near New Orleans and who has been  returned to the vessel by U.S. authori ties.  I have serious questions about the  procedures  followed by  the  in  this  case. My hope is that with passage of  this amendment,  the administration  will take every possible action to get to  the bottom of this case. In fact, I un derstand that President Reagan has  called upon Attorney General Meese  to see if further action by U.S. offi cials  is warranted. My  amendment  notes that the United States has his torically been a place of refuge for  those seeking escape from repression  and I believe that we must not turn  from that continuing responsibility.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting the amendment and I urge  its adoption.  ",1985
1858,921,22,Mr. SASSER.," Mr. President, I also  urge adoption of this amendment of fered by  the distinguished Senator  from Georgia and myself.  Mr. President, this amendment deals  with the unfortunate incident that oc curred not too many days ago regard ing Mr. Medvid, the Russian seaman  who  attempted  to  defect,  or  find  asylum, in the United States.  There  is some concern about  the  way in which this case was handled by  the Immigration Service. Frankly, as  one Senator, I have no doubt as  to  what a young man is doing who jumps  into the Mississippi River  twice and  swims to shore.  Clearly, he is in fear and, clearly, he  is trying to seek some secure resting  place.  That is  the thrust of this amend ment. I support it.  ",1985
1859,921,22,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Mr. President, I  ask unanimous consent that Senators  may insert statements into the RECORD  concerning  this amendment at  this  point.  ",1985

1861,921,22,Mr. GLENN.," Mr.  President,  like  many of my colleagues I have many  concerns and questions about the han dling of the Medvid incident by U.S.  officials. I have reviewed the affidavit  of  the  INS  interpreter who  inter viewed the Soviet seaman on October  24, 1985. That affidavit makes clear  that Mr. Medvid did express his desire  for political asylum in the U.S. during  that interview. Why then did the INS  return Mr. Medvid  to  the Marshal  Konev? Why did they not immediately  notify the State Department?  Subsequently, the State Department  maintains, they had the opportunity  to interview Mr. Medvid in a setting  which would allow him to freely ex press his wishes and he  repeatedly  stated his desire  to  return  to  the  U.S.S.R. One must wonder if during  the period of time between the two  interviews Mr. Medvid was so threat ened and  intimidated that he could  ",1985

Safety devices that should have avert ed this tragedy were not in place due  to the rush of holiday mail. The dedi cation of Michael McDermott Place  will  serve  a  dual  purpose:  It will  remind us of the public service and  sacrifice of this one individual.

None of the funds appropriated  under this Act shall be used to pay for abor tions for which Federal funds are not avail able under the Medicaid program <title XIX  of the Social Security Act>.  ",1985
1890,986,22,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr.  President,  this is a followup effort to the effort  which Just preceded it relative to abor tion.  Many Senators voting expressed con cern that the language excepting the  life of the mother was not in the meas ure before us just a moment ago.  So I propose and have offered this  amendment that would exempt in the  usual way that we have in Medicaid  and many other programs the life of  the mother in the matter of abortion.  That is by now a well-accepted ap proach by the Senate, indeed by both  Houses of Congress.  Apparently many Senators and Con gressmen make a distinction between  the fundamental issue of abortion, on  the one hand, and, on the other, the  matter of forcing taxpayers to pay for  abortion.  On another point that seems to be a  matter of concern to Senators, I will  confess  it  is not addressed  in  this  amendment. Some Senators feel that  it is an unwarranted interference with  the business of the District of Colum bia for the Senate to apply restrictions  to the District in the manner and in  the ways in which it can spend its own  money.  I suggest with all sincerity, and I  invite anyone to refute my argument  on this,  that Congress has not only  the authority but the responsibility to  pass judgment on expenditures by the  District.  In my earlier debate remarks, I cited  the provisions of the Constitution that  reserved  unto  Congress  legislative  powers over the District and likewise  read into the RzcoRD the relevant por tion of Public Law 93-198 by which  the District was granted limited home  rule. I reiterate, relative to the Mayor  and city council, no amount may be  obligated or expended by any officer  or employee of  the District unless  such amount has been approved by an  act of Congress.  In other words, the statute granting  the District limited home rule explicit ly restricted and reserved to Congress  all powers of appropriation.  So we have that power and with it  goes the responsibility to review  the  purposes to which these appropriated  funds are put.  Senators might not  like  that is our responsibility.  So I confess and acknowledge that  my amendment does not address that  point because in the view of this Sena tor that point does not need to be ad dressed, but it does address the point  relative  to excepting the life of the  mother.  Mr. President, also I think Senators  are well aware with all of the argu ments in this matter.  Mr. President, I especially want to  solicit the attention of Senators who  are opposed to abortion, and I espe cially want to solicit the attention of  Senators who are opposed to taxpayer  funding of abortion.  The purpose of  the amendment  have offered is to ensu!'e that funds  that, but  I  appropriated by Congress will not be  used by the government of the District  of Columbia  to pay  for  abortions,  except when the life of the mother is  threatened. If that  language sounds  familiar to Senators and staff, it refers  to the perennial Hyde amendment to  Medicaid, which the Senate has voted  to attach to various bills since 1976.  Mr. President,  I would point out  that the fiscal year 1986 District of  Columbia appropriations bill already  passed by the House contains such a  provision. The House of Representa tives by vote of 221to199, attached to  its version of the fiscal year 1986 Dis trict of Columbia appropriations bill  language which forbids the District of  Columbia  to pay for abortions with  funds appropriated by Congress.  In  other words, the House included in its  bill  language similar  to  the amend ment which I have offered. It's impor tant to note the language the House  included is not exactly the same as the  amendment now before  the Senate.  The difference is, where the amend ment now before  the Senate would  permit the funding of abortion where  the life of the mother is threatened,  the House bill does not permit that ex ception. The point is, the language in  the House bill is stricter than the lan guage which  I  have offered. As a  matter of fact, there was an effort in  the House to include language making  an exception in the case of a threat to  the mother's lite, but that effort was  blocked by parliamentary maneuver.  Some who are  listening  to my  re marks may be confused at this point.  They may be saying, ""But I thought  we have always included language for bidding  the District of Columbia  to  use Federal  funds  to pay  for abor tions."" So we have. The problem  is,  the District has found another avenue  to fund abortion using money appro priated by Congress. The purpose of  my amendment is to block that avenue  as well, so that the taxpayers are not  forced to pay for abortion, a procedure  which many find highly repugnant, to  say the least.  Mr. President, the District of Colum bia has a shameful, shocking record in  the matter of abortion. For every 10  babies who are born alive in the Na tion's capital, 15 were killed by abor tion. No city in the country has such  an awful  ratio of abortion  to child birth.  In 1983, 4,393 unborn babies were  killed by abortions paid for by the tax payers. Within a few miles of where  the Senate of the United States sits,  4,393  unborn babies were killed by  abortions paid for with funds appro priated by the Congress.  To make matters worse, Mr. Presi dent, officials of the District of Co lumbia government have recently ad mitted their procedures in the area of  abortion are lax. The District govern",1985
1891,999,22,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  share the Senator's support for a uni form minimum drinking age of 21 na tionwide. Our States share a border  with New York State, where the drink ing age has been lower than 21. We've  seen firsthand how differing minimum  drinking ages in the two States pro vide  incentives  for young people  to  drive across the border to drink. For tunately, New York has voted to raise  its minimum drinking age. Maryland  and Virginia,  however,  continue  to  face a border problem with the Dis trict.  The Senator's suggestion of a hear ing on this matter is a good one. The  District has until October 1, 1986, to  decide what to do about its minimum  drinking age, before facing the with holding of highway funds. The suband military  If  committee should monitor  the Dis trict's progress over the next year and  see if the District's small size and lim ited stake  in  the highway program  represents a unique situation, requir ing a different approach.

1910,1025,22,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today I  Join my colleagues, Senators MITCH ELL, BENTSEN, BURDICK, HART, LAUTEN  and MOYNIHAN  in  introducing  the Gound Water Protection Act of  1985.  Ground water is water located un derground that is  tapped for use by  wells. Ground water  is simply water  that has percolated down through the  soil from rain and melting snow.  There is 50 times more ground water  than  surface water  in  the United  States. Over half  the population of  the United States relies upon ground  water as their primary source of drink ing water.  For many rural Montanans, ground  water is the only source of water for  household use.  Yet, despite its importance, there is  no overall national policy  that pre vents contamination of ground water  resources.  EXTENT or GROUND WATER POLLUTION PROBLEM  Ground water  contamination  has  been detected  in every State  in  the  United States, and contamination  is  becoming more and more frequent.  A recent nationwide survey  identi fied over 200 natural and synthetic  substances in ground water.  The Congre~ional Office of Tech nology ~e~ment reports that:  Contaminants  found  in ground water particularly organic chemicals-are associat ed with adverse health, social, environmen tal, and economic impacts. Although only a  small portion of the Nation's total ground  water resource is thought to be contaminat  ed. the potential effects of this contamina tion are significant and warrant national at tention.  Montana does not face the extreme  health hazards posed by  the exotic  chemicals found in heavily industrial ized States, but ground water pollu tion still poses a serious health hazard.  Rural communities use fuel oil, pes ticides,  cleaning  solvents,  chemical  preservatives,  and  numerous  other  toxic substances. Many of these organ ic contaminations are not cleansed as  they percolate through the soil.  Thus they remain toxic for long pe riods of  time  and  contaminate  ac quif ers.  These contaminated water reservoirs  are monuments to our failure to learn  that the cost of clean up can be enor mously greater than the cost of pre venting contamination.  FEDERAL GROUND WATER STRATEGY  Up  to now,  the Federal Govern ment's response  to  this  threat has  been confusing. At  least 16 statutes  authorize programs relevant to ground  water protection.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency attempted to lay the ground work  for  centralized  control  over  ground water protection in a strategy  it adopted August 30, 1984.  The EPA established criteria for de termining the seriousne~ of a ground  water pollution threat. They also set  forth protection levels for three class es of ground water, based on their re spective  value  and  vulnerab111ty  to  contamination.  The problem with EPA's strategy is  that these special ground waters are  primarily located near urban areas.  .  Rural areas-where hazardous pol lutants are Just as serious a concern are given le~ importance. Thus degra dation of water quality in these areas  could be a result of the EPA classifica tion system.  A  second problem with  the EPA  strategy is that EPA is using its three  classifications as standards. Granted,  we need standards. But EPA's classifi cations should not be standards.  ",1985
1911,1038,22,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing a bill which will  make our tax policies and a number of  the tax  incentives that we have en acted in our Tax Code, consistent with  some of our environmental policies.  Since I sit on both the Finance Com mittee  and  the  Environment  and  Public Works Committee,  I  am  in volved  in debate on both of  these  issues, and I fear that sometimes the  right hand does not know what the  left hand  is doing  in  these matters.  The legislation I am introducing today  is designed to make our policies more  consistent in these two areas.  It seems only logical that we should  not allow tax incentives which encour age unwanted development in areas we  are seeking to protect through other  nontax related legislation. The bill I  am introducing today would therefore  eliminate various  tax incentives that  subsidize activities which harm certain  designated natural areas of ecological  significance. I have called these areas  ""Environmental Zones.""  Important natural  ecosystems  are  being  degraded  by  development  in  many areas of the United States. For  example,  several  hundred  thousand  acres of wetlands are lost each year.  Approximately 80 percent of this loss  is attributable to agriculture, often in  the form of cattle raising or forestry,  and much of the remainder is linked  to urban development.  Some of  the activities which  are  posing a  threat  to  these ecosystems  are encouraged and/or underwritten  by  tax credits and deductions. With  regard to wetlands, for example, the  Office of Technology Assessment has  concluded that:  Tax deductions and credits for all types of  general development activities provide the  most significant Federal incentive for farm ers to clear and drain wetlands.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would selectively deny special tax de ductions and credits for activities  in  the  designated  ""Environmental  Zones."" The bill would not eliminate  deductions for ordinary and necessary  business expenses that are incurred in  connection with activities carried on  within these zones, nor would it elimi nate the abtuty of businesses to recov er their capital expenditures in an un accelerated manner for projects within  these zones. Further,  it would not  limit deductions for interest or State  and local taxes for businesses in the  zones.  The bill is targeted to eliminate only  the accelerated methods of cost recov ery and the other special  tax incen tives, such as tax credits, for activities  within the zones. You could say that I  am proposing the purest form of tax  reform for these zones. Many of the  deductions and credits I am proposing  to eliminate in the zones may be cut back or eliminated  as part of  tax  reform. If that happens, portions of  this legislation may become unneces sary. However,  I  suspect  that any  major tax reform bill will be unable to  accomplish the pure reform which I  am suggesting for these zones, so the  basic plan proposed by this legislation  will be necessary even  if we pass a  major tax reform plan.  In this bill, I am saying to would-be  developers, ""Proceed if you wish, but  you will get no encouragement from  the Federal Government in the way of  tax breaks."" There will be no tax in centives  for  development  in  these  zones because such incentives run di rectly counter to our efforts to pre serve these natural areas.  The areas covered by  this bill are  those that have already been clearly  identified as important natural areas  either by Congress or, pursuant  to  other laws, by the Secretaries of the  Interior or Agriculture. Another crite ria that was used to define ""environ mental zones"" is the lack of existing  authorities  to manage  a  particular  area in such a way as to assure that in compatible private activities are pre cluded. For example, areas designated  for addition to the National Wildlife  Refuge System are included as ""envi ronmental zones"" unless such areas  have been added to the system and are  subject  to  the  National Wildlife  Refuge Administration Act. Once such  areas are subject to the laws governing  management of the system, we have  solved  the problem of  incompatible  private activity being unknowingly en couraged and allowed  to go  forward.  In that instance, the special treatment  provided by the bill would not be nec essary.  Other areas that are included under  similar conditions and for similar rea sons are lands designated for addition  to the National Park, Forest, or Wild  and Scenic River Systems. The ration ale for special treatment and the defi nition of ""environmental zones""  in cludes units of the Coastal Barrier Re sources Act, critical habitat designated  under  the Endangered Species Act,  and national natural landmarks under  the Historic Sites, Building, and Antiq uities Act.  There wlll  be no  investment  tax  credit, no accelerated depreciation, no   percentage depletion,  no  immediate  expensing of intangible drilling costs,  no special treatment for land clearing  expenditures or soil and water consei- vation expenditures, no capital gains  treatment for timber, coal or iron ore,  and no exceptions to the at risk rule  for activities  in the zones. All  these  special tax benefits wlll simply be un available to those seeking to develop  these protected areas.  I look forward to holding a hearing  on  the blll and  receiving comments  from all interested parties. For exam ple, is the definition of ""environmen",1985
1912,1064,22,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, Ameri ca's farmlands are disappearing at an  alarmingly  rapid  rate. During  the  1970's slightly over 1 million acres of  rural land were converted to urban or  transportation uses.  The loss of farmlands continues to  accelerate, despite steps taken by Con gress to slow this process-most nota bly the passage of the Farmland Pro tection Policy Act in 1981. This act es tablished the intent of Congress that  Federal policies should not contribute  to t.he unnecessary conversion of farm land to other uses.  Although FPPA enjoyed broad bi partisan support in Congress, the ad ministration has given it an exceeding ly narrow interpretation. The blll I in troduce  today would not materially  change existing statutes, but would  clarify the intent of Congress, as ex pressed  in  the Farmland Protection  Polley Act.    Speclflcally,  this blll would ensure  that the Farmer's Home Administra disposes  of  f annland  which it has acquired through foreclo sure in a manner consistent with the  FPPA.  Under  the blll  I  am  introducing  today, F'mHA would be  required  to  make a good faith effort to keep land  in agricultural use, rather than simply  selling it off to the highest bidder.

1915,1077,22,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Mr. President,  by its inaction, the Congre~ has sanc tioned the first direct military sales by  our Government to Red China. This is  a short-sighted policy  that holds no  advantages to the United States, other  than the immediate gratification of a  few contractors, but it does threaten  to disturb the peace and security of  East Asia.  The United States is placing its reli ance upon the wrong government. In stead of  cowtowing  to Peking, we  should be strengthening our ties with  the Republic of China on Taiwan and  improving the self-defense capabilities  of our long-time, trusted ally on that  island.  The  romance with Red China  is  nothing new. I recall that certain offi cials  in  the Carter  administration  viewed Communist China as the Pacif ic anchor on NATO. Unfortunately,  the groundwork for a Peking-Washing ton defense relationship that began in  the Carter administration has been ex panded by the present administration.  Secretary of State Haig visited Red  China in June 1981, and announced  that the United States was willing to  sell  lethal military  equipment  to  Peking. Secretary Shultz held 4 days  of talks with Communist officials in  February 1983, including the subjects  of technology trans! er and military co operation. In May 1983, Secretary of  Commerce Baldridge  promised Red  China's leaders that the United States  would allow  them  to buy advanced  technology  barred  to  the  Soviet  Union. Secretary of Defense Wein berger made a  conditional off er  in  September 1983  to sell the Red Chi nese certain defensive weapon systems  and negotiated the exchange of work ing military missions.  Then the August 1984, Secretary of  the Navy Lehman issued a statement  saying that his visit to Red China had  laid a foundation for future military  cooperation, a visit that was followed  by a meeting in January 1985 between  General  Ve~ey, Chairman,  Joint  to Congr~.  Chiefs of Staff, with Red China's  Chief of General Staff Yang. Last  month, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen eral Gabriel was in Peking and it is  speculated  he  discussed  how  the  United States can help modernize Red  China's Air Force.  Peking's  first major  purchase  of  United States equipment was through  the commercial sale last year of 24 S70C2 Sikorsky helicopters, civilian ver sions of the military ""Black Hawk.""  Then, in August this year, Red China  reportedly signed a contract with Gen eral Electric  to acquire five GE LM  2500 gas turbine naval engines for de stroyers.  The first foreign military sales pack age, which was included in the admin istration's recent notice  covers the design and general layout  of an artillery munitions factory and  date  packages  for M-82  primers,  M577Al and M739Al fuses, and M107  155mm projectiles. There have been  scattered reports in the news media of  other potential arms sales,  including  Hawk antiaircraft mWiles,  improved  TOW antitank mWiles, with a larger  warhead capable of greater armor pen etration, Mark 46 antisubmarine tor pedoes, General Dynamics's Phalanx  close-in weapons system designed  to  protect surface ships from cruise mis siles, modem towed sonars, and avion ics  to upgrade and modernize Red  China's F-8 fighter.  At  the same  time as  these moves  toward  closer  defense  cooperation  with Communist China have occurred;  the administration decided not to sell  an advanced fighter aircraft to Taiwan  and issued a  joint communique with  Red China declaring ""that the United  States intends to reduce gradually its  sales of arms  to Taiwan."" The  rel evance of the Republic of China to our  strategic interests has been lost in the  sales rush to penetrate the market in  Red China.  Unfortunately,  our  policymakers  have blinded  themselves  to the fact  that the task of modernizing Commu nist China's mmtary is so enormous  she could never realistically become a  match  for  the Soviet Union. James  Gregor  estimates  that  the United  States would have to give Red China  well over $100 billion in mmtary aid in  order to build its mtutary capab111ties  sufficiently to deter a Soviet attack.  When the cost of domestic infrastruc ture  is  included,  the  total defense  modernization program would be  in  the area of $300 b1111on.  Although  Red  China  could  not  become a mtutary counterweight  to  the Soviet Union, it can pose a serious  threat to United States allies in East  Asta. While Red China's effect on the  global balance is being exaggerated, its  position as a regional power is being  overlooked.  In addition to having the potential  of destabilizing  the position of our  true  friends  in Asta,  it appears no  thought has been given by the admin istration to what impact United States  arms sales may have on the domestic  situation  in mainland China. Why  American officials have not considered  the p~ibiltty that Red China's lead ership will not remain friendly to the  United States is beyond me.  Whatever the efforts of the 81-year old Deng to name his own succ~ors,  no one has any real idea of what group  will succeed him. There is little the  United States can do  to change the  politics of a billion people, but what  we may unknowingly accomplish by  providing military assistance is to sig nificantly alter the internal balance of  power on  the mainland. Since we  cannot predict what the effect will be,  tJ:i.Js  is a  risky move  that clearly  is  unwise to pursue any further.  Mr. President, a sensible policy for  the United States would emphasize  the strategic role of the Republic of  China. From a  strategic standpoint,  Taiwan and the offshore islands stand  at pivotal positions between the main  sea lanes connecting the Indian and  Pacific Oceans  through which nows  the petroleum from Mideast wells that  fuels  the  economies of  Japan  and  South Korea and which serves as a  link with the United States 7th Fleet.  Taiwan bridges  the surrounding air  and sea lanes and provides a valuable  strategic asset for the United States.  This becomes ever more apparent as  the situation in the Philippines dete riorates.  The United States has It within its  capacity to improve the pos1t1on of the  Republic  of  China  and  thus  to  strengthen Its strategic stgnlf lcance to  Western interests. The first priority is  to offer Taiwan new, all-weather fight er interceptors to replace Its aging in ventory.  Ideally,  a  creditable  anti blockade defense would also  include  new helicopters to identify and track  submarines,  effective  countermissile  measures, and other enhanced defense  capab111ties.  Mr. President, I would repeat that  instead of seeking a military relation ship with Communist China, the inter ests of the United States will be best  served by strengthening existing ties  with the pro-Western and private en terprise nations of Asta and the Pacif ic.  Finally, Mr. President,  I wish  to  share with my colleagues an excellent  commentary on  the subject of  the  arms sales  relationship between  the  United States  and Red China  au thored by Martin Lasater, director of  the Asian studies center at the Herit age Foundation.

BILL RICHARDSON  OF NEW llEXICO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 7, 1985  ",1985
1923,1116,22,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, as an  example of a successful economic develop ment  initiative by  the  Indian people,  I  would like to insert in the liECORD two ar ticles about the Jicarilla Inn in Dulce, NM.  Tom Vigil, a Jicarilla Apache, has put  this successful enterprise together with the  help of the Jicarilla Apache tribal adminis tration.  Those who are critical of the self-reliance  of the Indian people can see first-hand this  success story.  The articles follow:  APACHE INDIAN HERITAGE Is HEART OF NEW  INN  <By Skip Boyer>  DULCE. NM.-They came up to the surface  of the earth from an ancient underworld  where  all  living  things dwelled. Seeking  light, they were guided by Hae ct'cin, the ul  timate power.  After many trials, they reached the sur face and began traveling, all people and ani mals. Small groups broke off and settled  while others continued their travels. At last,  there was only one group left, continually  circling the world.  Hae ct'cin asked, ""Where do you want to  live?"" The last travelers replied, ""Near the  center of the earth."" Hae ct'cin considered  this and created four sacred rivers to outline  the land at the center of the earth. Accord ing  to their own story of the creation of  mankind,  this  land became holy and  the  people were known henceforth as the Jicar ma Apaches <pronounced hekare'ya>.  This, of course, happened a  long  time  ago-in the days when animals still spoke  with humans, before good and evil.  Today, the Jicarilla Apache Tribe lives on  a reservation of 780,000 acres in northcen tral New Mexico-still near  the center of  the earth. In the years between their emer gence from the underworld and today is a  story of the growth of a culture. It is the  story of a people with  infinite patience,  flexibility and imagination. It is a story of  survival, despite Spanish conquerors, moun talnmen, miners, settlers and a capricious  federal government.  Nouem'ber 7, 1985  THE BEST WESTEIUf .JICARILLA INN  You don't have to know all that history,  of course, when you check in to the Best  Western Jicarilla Inn. It is a Best Western.  You already know what  to expect: good  service and quality lodgings at a fair price.  You can enjoy  this remarkably beautiful  land with its abundant hunting and fishing  without even knowing how  to pronounce  the name of the hotel.  If you miss the history, however, you miss  the thing that makes this new Best Western  member so special. Located on the north eastern comer of the tribal reservation. the  Best Western Jicarilla Inn was financed by  the  Jicarilla Apache Tribe  for  Jlcarilla  Apache owners and operators. Their herit age has influenced everything from interior  design to management philosophy.  At the heart of Best Westem's only Amer ican Indian-owned property  is B. Thomas  ""Tom"" Vigil, president of Vigil Family En terprises, Inc. With his brother. Fred, and  wife,  Irene, Vigil  <pronounced Veehill>  heads the family group that envisioned the  42-room property two years ago.  In late July, Tribal and Best Western dig nitaries helped mark the grand opening of  the new property. It is already making an  impact  in Dulce,  a  community of 3,200  people.  ""We've made a terrific impact in a short  time,'' Vigil  notes.  ""This  community  is  proud of the hotel. I think they want us to  succeed. The measure we use of our local ac ceptance is the trade we do In our restau rant-we've served a tremendous number of  meals since we opened.""  Vigil is proud of his Hill Crest Restaurant.  Its unusual decor reflects the Jlcarilla herit age in a striking way. Rough cut poles form  abstract arbors over the tables throughout  the main dining room. Similar arbors stand  throughout the reservation and are used for  ceremonial purposes. Large,  framed black  and white photographs recalling tribal his tory hang throughout the dining room and  coffee shop.  While the growing regional reputation of  the Hill Crest is playing an important role  in the Inn's early success, it is not the only  reason.  A FAMILY OPERATION  ""The real reason we have come so far in  such a short  time,'' Vigil says, ts this:  I  have a brother who is partner in this oper ation. We have two other brothers working  with us, a sister who is our secretary and a  number of other  relatives-Including my  grandmother-working  In other capacities  here. I sprinkle the staff with people who  have hotel experience but basically, we are  a family operation.""  Vigil is also pleased with his ""silent"" part ner. The Jlcarilla Apache Tribe. Through  the tribal council, the Tribe is financing the  $2.3 million facility. ""The Tribe is playing  the role normally played by a bank,"" ex plains Vigil. ""We undertook  this Joint en deavor to fulfill a  local need,  to curb the  leakage of dollars off the reservation. to be  able to accommodate our guests and busi ness associates In comfort and convenience  and, most importantly, to gain a profitable  return on our Investment. The Tribe is a  good business partner.  That works both ways: Tom Vigil is a good  man to have as a partner, himself.  Like most of his people,  this land along  the Continental Divide is his home. He loves  It, even  though he has spent most of his  adult life living in Los Angeles and Wash ington, D.C.  ",1985

1926,1155,22,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, first of  all, I thank my colleagues for Joining  in this colloquy today, this discussion  on  the ABM.  I  thank Senator DAN  FORTH, Senator Gou:, and any others  who choose to participate.  Mr. President, this ls the second col loquy we  have  sponsored  on  the  Senate  floor concerning  the adverse  implications of  the  administration's  recent  reinterpretation of  the ABM  Treaty. Last month, National Security  Advisor Robert McFarlane made  a  sudden announcement of a reinterpre tation  of  the Anti-Ballistic Missile  Treaty, which has become administra tion policy. The administration now  claims that the ABM Treaty permits  development and testing of ABM sys tems ""based on other physical princi ples."" In other words, the U.S. Govern ment now insists that the ABM Treaty  would allow the strategic defense initi ative  to proceed beyond research  to  unlimited development and testing of  new space-based weapons. Such a view point flies in the face of the legal in terpretations of past administrations,  the negotiators of  the ABM Treaty  and the Members of the Senate who  voted-88 to 2-for that treaty in 1972.  Mr. President. let us listen to what  the chief negotiator said about  the  treaty. Ambassador Gerard  Smith,  who was our negotiator for the ABM  Treaty, said in a letter to the editor of  the New York Times, dated October 23  of this year:  It was not our <the ABM Treaty negotiat ing team> intention that any type of tech nology for space-based ABM systems could  be developed or tested under the treaty.  The Senate's approval of the treaty  in 1972 was based on that interpreta tion. Senator  James Buckley voted  against the treaty because he under stood Smith's interpretation to be cor rect. And Senator Buckley disapproved  of that interpretation and, therefore,  voted against the treaty and said at  the time:  Article 5 would have the effect, for exam ple, of prohibiting  the development and  testing of a  laser  type system based  in  space ....  if  Senator Buckley voted against it be cause he  recognized  that  limitation  was  in the treaty and,  therefore, he  was opposed to it.  Therefore,  the  administration  sticks to its new interpretation of the  treaty, it is tantamount to overriding  the understanding of the ABM Treaty  on which  the Senate acted  in 1972.  While I believe the treaty to be very  clear,  if  the  administration wishes  clarification  of  the  language  they  should utilize the Standing Consulta tive Committee which was set up in  the treaty for Just such an event. This  seems to be a more prudent way of  doing business than merely announc ing a new interpretation.  Ambassador Smith, whose views de serve special weight since he was the  principal negotiator, has said the new  interpretation, ""reduces the treaty to  a dead letter."" If the new interpreta tion stands, we wtll be off to the races  in yet another area of weapons. He  went on  to  say  that,  ""this  radical  change  in a central provision of the  treaty, which  is  the supreme  law of  the United States, was apparently ac complished in secrecy without consul tation with the Congress or U.S. allies  for which this treaty has security sig nificance.""  This new version of the treaty ls a  complete reversal of the view held by  every administration since the treaty  was signed, including the present ad ministration. The 1985 Arms Control  Impact Statement, submitted by Presi dent Reagan to Congress, specifically  stated:  ",1985
1927,1168,22,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  in addition, I want to point out some  language in the article:  Last month,  the Treasury Department  recommended giving a couple of hundred  million dollars a year in extra foreign  tax  credits  to multinational  firms  that-you  guessed it-do research in the United States  to  support  foreign manufacturing  oper ations.  The purpose of this tax break, its numer ous congressional  supporters claim,  to  stimulate R&D here at home. What they  fail to consider, however is that the real in  centive can be to shift manufacturing Jobs  offshore. By definition, the added tax cred its are available only  to companies with  large foreign operations.  ls  Continuing on, the article says:  The  foreign  tax credit bonus at  issue  would extend a ""temporary"" measure en acted in 1981 and scheduled to expire this  year. Pushed by Atari Democrats and ITT,  this measure blocked the IRS for two years  from  enforcing  its ""Section 861""  regula tions-rules promulgated in 1977  to try to  curb tax subsidies for foreign manufactur ing.  The 1981  law  required  the Treasury  to  analyze the impact of suspencling the 861  regulations and report its findings to Con gress this year. In May, Treasury staff duti fully completed a draft study that found  the loophole unjustified. But then politics  intervened.  Under pressure from congressional Repub licans and multinational companies, Treas ury Secretary Donald Regan ordered at last  minute reversal of the report's conclusion.  Mr. President,  in my opinion,  the  U.S. Treasury needs this $277 million  a year. It would help us substantially  in attempting to balance the budget.  There is no economic Justification for  permitting this mind of a tax subsidy  for research done here for Jobs that  are being shipped overseas. The Treas ury was right in the first instance and  ",1985
1928,1181,22,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to cosponsor this amendment  to strike provisions of the budget rec onciliation bill  that will  reduce or  eliminate food stamp benefits for our  poorest citizens. I urge my colleagues  to support this amendment.  The Low-Income Energy Assistance  Act has always stated that energy as sistance payments shall not be count ed as income or resources for purposes  of any other Federal or State pro gram, including food stamps. It is the  intent of Congress that energy assist ance payments will supplement, rather  than supplant, other forms of assist ance. Our poor and elderly citizens  should not be penalized for accepting  assistance to pay skyrocketing utillty  bills.  A provision in the budget reconcilla tion bill changes  this  long-standing  policy. This provision would not allow  the f oc:d stamp applicant to  include  any  energy  assistance  payments  in  their  shelter  cost  deduction.  This  means that the applicant's deduction  will  be  lower,  thus  resulting  in  a  higher net income and reduced food  stamp benefits.  Unless  this  provision  is  removed  from the budget reconclllation legisla tion, 5.5 million low-income Americans  face reduction in food stamp benefits  during the winter months, when good  nutrition  is especially  important for  good health. The average monthly re duction  in food stamp benefits over  the 5-month heating season is $14.70.  The  impact of this change  in Ohio  would mean an average reduction in  food stamp benefits of $10 per month  during  the 5-month heating season,  and a maximum reduction of $26. 70  per month. The number of affected  households in Ohio would be a stag gering 270,000. In colder regions of our  country  the  impact  is  even more  severe. On average, Vermont  recipi ents will  lose  $28.30  each winter  month, recipients in Alaska and Min nesota will lose over $32 each month,  and in North Dakota, the average loss  will be $41 each month.  This provision will strike hardest at  our elderly and disabled citizens, and  could mean not  just a  reduction  in  food stamp benefits but a loss in eligi billty  for  them. Unlike other appli cants for food stamps, eligibility for  the elderly and disabled is based solely  on net income after deductions. The  change  in  shelter  cost  deductions  could eliminate eligibility for elderly  households near the 130 percent pov erty level. Winter weather has already  arrived in my State of Ohio and other  parts of the country. It is unconscion able to force poor Americans, particu larly those who are elderly or disabled,  into a ""heat or eat"" choice.  Mr. President, such a major change  in policy should not be enacted with out carefully considering  Its serious  impact on our poor and elderly citi zens. I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment.e  e ",1985
1929,1181,22,Mr. BOSCHWITZ.," Mr. President, I  rise today in support of the Agricul ture Committee's shelter deduction  provision in the Food Stamp Program  reauthorization, specifically Its treat ment of payments under  the Low  Income Energy Assistance Act  and  utillty  costs.  Senator  STA.rTORD's  amendment would strike the commit tee provision.

1930,1194,22,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to be a cosponsor of the Moy nihan amendment. Under the policies  followed by the Treasury Department,  the Social Security Trust Fund  is  likely to lose more than $1 billion in  the coming year unless Congress acts  to prevent it.  The  Treasury  Department  an nounced a few weeks ago that it would  prematurely strip the interest paid on  certain Social Security  trust  funds  unless  the debt  limit was  increased  before November 1. What Treasury  did not tell us, however, is that it had  taken precisely that kind of action on  a number of past occasions, without  informing the public  trustees of the  fund or the Congress. In fact, over $24  billion has been disinvested so far this  year, and more than $5 billion was dis invested in 1984.  The Social Security accounts have  lost money from nonreceipt of interest  on funds not invested. But they have  lost far more as a result of the funds  being eventually  reinvested at lower  rates of interest.  The amendment I am cosponsoring  requires the Treasury Department to  make the Social Security Trust Fund  whole. Trust funds are accounted for  separately in the budget from Federal  raise  It will  funds and should be kept separate  even in a fiscal crisis of the Govern ment's own making. Social Security  should not be required to pay for the  inefficient method by which the Fed eral Government runs itself.  Adoption and passage by the Con gress of this amendment will ensure  fair  and  proper  treatment  of  the  Social Security Trust Fund.  make up for the inappropriate treat ment of the fund in the past, and will  help avoid  future  invasions of  the  fund. I urge all Senators to support  the Moynihan amendment.  e ",1985
1931,1194,22,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President,  I  rise as a cosponsor of Senator Monn HAN's amendment to the budget recon ciliation bill which would require that  the Department of the Treasury re issue to the Social Security and other  retirement trust funds all bonds that  were redeemed during September, Oc tober, and November 1985 due to the  debt-limit situation.  Beginning in September of this year,  the Treasury faced a problem with the  issuance  of Social Security benefit  checks because of the statutory debt  limit. Congress' failure  to  the  debt limit apparently led to the disin vestment of  securities held  in  the  Social Security  trust  funds  in  the  amount of $7  billion  in  long-term  bonds from the trust funds in Septem ber and another $4 billion in October.  This amendment would also require  the Secretary to reimburse, on June  30, 1986, such trust funds for interest  lost as a result of redemption, disin vestment, or noninvestment of  the  assets of these funds occurring during  the most  recent debt-limit situation  occurring in October 1984.  Last week, during the hearing in the  Senate Finance Committee  on  the  Social Security Trust Fund  Invest ment Policy,  the members  learned  from the Social Security Administra tion,  that there was no requirement  that Congress or the public trustees be  notified  when  Treasury  disinvest&  Social Security assets to meet a debt limit crisis.  I expressed my concern about the  lack of a requirement to notify Con gress and the public trustees of such  significant action of the Treasury as  the disinvestment of Social Security  bonds.  I am pleased that this amendment I  rise to support today will require a 15day prior notification to Congress and  the Social Security Board of Trustees  of any intention by the Secretary of  the Treasury to disinvest or not invest  Social Security Trust Fund assets due  to the debt limit.  Social Security is vital to the well being of millions of senior citizens in  our country.

1939,1246,22,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to begin by  paying a very special  tribute  to my  very good friend and our distinguished  colleague from California CMr. LAao MARSINO],  the author of this resolu tion in the House, which has already  been  adopted  by  the  other  body,  where  it was  introduced by Senator  HUMPHREY on October 25.  Perhaps more  so  than any other  Member of the House of Representatives, the gentleman from California,  in his own quiet but effective way, has  managed to put the issue of Afghani stan on the agenda of the Congress  and of the country, and he has inde fatigably pursued the effort to mobi lize support, both in the Congress and  around  the  country,  on  behalf  of  American assistance; politically, diplo matically and in other ways, for the  very brave resistance fighters  in Af ghanistan.  This resolution which he authored  which is before us today expresses the  support of the Congress for the deter mination of President Reagan to raise  the Afghan problem in his discussions  with the leader of the Soviet Union,  Mr. Gorbachev, when  they meet  in  Geneva next week.  This will indeed by the first summit  conference between the leaders of our  two nations since the invasion of Af ghanistan by the Soviet Union in 1979.  D 1300  Over the course of the last 6 years,  up to a million Afghans have lost their  lives in ways that are clearly attributa ble to the Soviet occupation of their  country.  Through  carpet  bombing,  through the destruction of crops and  irrigation networks, and through the  use of chemical agents against  the  people of Afghanistan as well, hun dreds of thousands and up to a million  of them have lost their lives; a third of  the entire Afghan nation has been  driven into exile and are now living as  refugees in the neighboring nations of  Pakistan and Iran.  At this very moment, 115,000 Soviet  troops continue to occupy the country.  In response to this brutal invasion. the  people of Afghanistan, almost as they  were one, have risen up against their  oppressors. There can be no doubt but  that the primary issue on the agenda  at Geneva when President Reagan  meets with Chairman Gorbachev will  be the overriding need for some kind  of breakthrough in the effort to bring  the arms race and nuclear weapons  under control. But arms control and  the arms race will not be  the only  issues under discussion at Geneva. It is  very  important that some of the re gional conflicts which could potential ly escalate into superpower confronta tions be put on  the agenda as well.  And  there  is  indeed no other  issue,  other than arms control, where  the  Soviet Union could make a greater  contribution to the reduction of ten sions between our two countries than  on Afghanistan, if they were prepared  to indicate a willingness to withdraw  all of their forces from that country  and to permit the Afghan people to  freely determine their own future and  the  refugees who have been driven  from that country to return in honor.  I  am sure  that President Reagan  would have raised this issue at Geneva  ",1985

1944,1259,22,Mr. WILLIAMS.," These terms are in tended to be construed as being con sistent with all of the standards set  forth in the U.S. Supreme Court's de cision in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.  424 < 1983 >.  In this case,  the Court  held, in part, that:  The extent of a plaintiff's success is a cru cial  factor  in  determining  the  proper  amount of an award of attorneys' fees.  Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on  a claim that is distinct in all respects from  his successful claims, the hours spent on the  unsuccessful claim should be excluded  in  considering the amount of a reasonable fee.  Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a  plaintiff who has won  substantial  relief  should not have his attorneys' fee reduced  simply because the court did not adopt each  contention raised. But where the plaintiff  achieved only  limited  success,  the court  should award only that amount of fees that  is reasonable in relation to the results ob tained.  ",1985
1945,1259,22,Mr. BARTLETT.," I thank the gentle man. Do you share my expectation  that, although the precise amount of  fees  awarded  to a prevailing party  must be determined on the facts of  each case, it is the intent of this legis lation that the courts will not simply  pay  lip service  to Hensley decision;  rather  they will actually undertake  the analyses set out in the decision?  ",1985
1946,1259,22,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Yes, I would agree  with that interpretation.  ",1985
1947,1259,22,Mr. BARTLETT., And would you  also agree that it is the intent of this  legislation that the courts must pro vide a concise but clear explanation of  their reasons for the fee award?  ,1985
1948,1259,22,Mr. WILLIAMS., Yes.  ,1985
1949,1259,22,Mr. BARTLETT.," To ensure that we  all have the same understanding of  the standards set out in Hensley,  I  would  like  clarification  of  certain  issues  that are of particular  impor tance  to me. First, would you state  your understanding of  the starting  point for determining the reasonable ness of a fee and the prevailing party's  obligation with respect to the claim?  ",1985
1950,1259,22,Mr. WILLIAMS.," In accordance with  Hensley, a useful starting point for de termining the amount of a reasonable  fee is the number of hours reasonably  expended on the litigation multiplied  by  the reasonable hourly  rate. The  parents bear the burden of establish ing their entitlement and documenting  the amount. The parents' attorney  must submit evidence supporting the  hours worked and the rates claimed.  Where documentation  is  inadequate,  the court may reduce the award ac cordingly. The court also should ex clude from the fee calculation those  hours  that were not reasonably ex pended. Cases may be overstaffed and  the skill and experience of  lawyers  vary widely. Hours that are excessive,  redundant, or otherwise unnecessary  should also be excluded. An applicant  for fees must exercise billing judgment  with  respect  to  hours  and  should  maintain billing  time  records  in  a  manner that will enable a  reviewing  court to identify distinct claims.  ",1985
1951,1259,22,Mr. BARTLETT., What is your un derstanding of the next point of in quiry?  ,1985
1952,1259,22,Mr. WILLIAMS.," The product of rea sonable hours times a reasonable rate  does  not  end  the  inquiry.  There  remain other considerations, including  the critical factor of the results ob tained. This factor is particularly cru cial where a plaintiff is deemed a ""pre vailing party"" even though he or she  succeeded on only some of the claims  for relief. In this situtation two ques tions must be addressed:  First. Did the parent fail to prevail  on claims that were unrelated to the  claims on which he or she succeeded?  Second. Did  the parent achieve a  level of success that makes hours rea sonably expended a satisfactory basis  for making a fee award?  Our intent to  limit awards  to the  parents when they are the prevailing  party requires that unrelated claims  be treated as if they had been raised in  separate lawsuits and therefore no fee  may be awarded for services on the un successful unrelated claims.  Where the prevailing party only ob tains partial or  limited success,  the  product of hours reasonably expended  on the litigation as a whole times a  reasonable hourly rate may be an ex cessive amount. This will be true even  where  the prevailing party's claims  were  interrelated, nonfrivolous,  and  raised in good faith. The most critical  factor is the degree of success.  Where the parents only win on a  preliminary  procedural matters-for  example, motion to compel discovery,  certification of  the class, or motion  filed by the school district to dismiss  the action-but they fail to prevail on  the merits on any claim, for example,  a claim that the hearing examiner was  not impartial, they are not considered  a ""prevailing"" party and therefore are  not entitled to fees.  And finally, in contrast, where a pre vailing party has obtained ""excellent""  results, his or her attorney should be  entitled to recover a full fee. See the  text of Hensley accompanying  foot notes 9 and 11. Under these circum stance, the fee award should not be re duced simply because  the prevailing  party failed to prevail on every conten tion raised in the lawsuit. Litigants in  good faith may raise alternative legal  grounds for a desired outcome and the  courts rejection or a failure to reach  certain  grounds  is  not  sufficient  reason for reducing a fee. The result is  what matters.  ",1985

1956,1259,22,Mr. BIAGGI.," I thank the chairman  for yielding and I also take this oppor tunity to commend him for his vital  contribution and leadership; also the  gentleman from Texas CMr. BARTLET!']  for his sense of cooperation.  Although we have arrived at  this  point, Mr. Speaker, it was not without  some great difficulty,  and  I  regret  deeply that 3CB>. the codification por tion of the bill has been deleted, be cause in my mind it was critical to per manently protect  the  rights of  the  handicapped children, which were ad dressed in this bill; but for the sake of  expediting this bill and providing once  and for all a clarification with relation  to attorney's fees, I rise to support the  legislation.  As one of the original authors of  Public Law 94-142, which was enacted  some 10 years ago, I have during this  period  shepherded  its  development  and clearly, it has worked the will of  the then Congress. I am proud to be  here today to support this legislation.  The part of the bill that the gentle man  from Texas  says  is  flawed  I  regard as its strength. What we are  talking about is providing attorneys'  fees  for  those  individuals who  are  being denied access to the educational  system; access as provided by Public  Law 94-142.  It is argued that the hearings are in formal and that the school boards are  generally cooperative. The reality of  the matter  is  this: We are  talking  about Mr. or Mrs. John Doe who have  a problem with a child gaining access,  who then come before a school board.  While most of us have experience, tes tifying in one forum or another; so  hence we are not impressed nor more  intimidated by a school board.

1958,1272,22,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker, House Res olution 312 makes in order the consid eration of House Joint Resolution 441,  which extends the continuing appro priations for fiscal year 1986 from No vember 14, 1985, through December 5,  1985. This is a modified closed rule,  providing 1 hour of general debate di vided between the chairman and rank ing Republican on the Appropriations  Committee.  The rule makes in order one amend ment to be offered in the Committee  of the Whole-an amendment by the  gentleman  from Washington  CMr.  FOLEY]  printed  in  last  Friday's  RECORD. The amendment is debatable  for 1 hour divided between Congress man FOLEY and a Member opposed,  and is not subject to amendment or a  division of the question in the House  or in the Committee of the Whole. Fi nally, the rule provides for one motion  to recommit.  The chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, has requested this exten sion at the behest of the leadership on  his side to permit us to enact as many  of the regular appropriations as possi ble before we adjourn sometime  in  early December.  Mr. Speaker, I support this short term extension of the continuing reso lution because I do  think we should  encourage the completion of work on  as many appropiations bills as we can  yet this year. To date only 1 of the 13  regular appropriations bills has been  enacted, and 2 others have been sent  to the President,  though the House  has now passed 12 of the 13, and the  other body has passed 10. So we are  within reach of that goal.  Mr. Speaker, during the Rules Com mittee consideration of this rule, the  distinguished Republican  leader,  the  gentleman from lliinois CMr. MICHEL],  asked that he be permitted to off er an  amendment to the continuing resolu tion that would reduce all the control lable expenditures under that act by  8.2 percent.  He explained that, based on a CBO  estimate,  the House-passed Rosten kowski substitute for Gramm-Rudman  would require precisely such a reduc tion in those controllable items not ex empted by it. You will recall that the  Democrat alternative had a deficit of  $161 billion this year, but exempted  several low-income programs from re ductions.  Our Republican leader reasoned, and  rightly so, I think, that if this House is  really serious about that much deficit  reduction this year, it should be aware  of the consequences now and 'be will ing to vote for  those results in real  program cuts now. If we aren't really  serious,  then we should agree on a  more reasonable deficit level and get  on with it.  Mr. Speaker, shortly after our Re publican  leader laid his proposal on  the table in the Rules Committee last  Wednesday,  the chairman adjourned  the committee pending a meeting with  the Democratic  leadership. The  re sults were made known on Thursday  when the distinguished majority whip,  the gentleman from Washington CMr.  FOLEY] appeared before our commit tee.  He asked that he be permitted to  off er an amendment that would bring  spending down  to a  level consistent  with the Rostenkowski alternative to  Gramm-Rudman. He went on to ex plain that a more recent CBO calcula tion would make that a cut of around  5 percent, instead of the 8.2 percent  initially estimated by CBO. The fol lowing day,  last Friday, when Mr.  FOLEY actually put his amendment in  the RECORD. as required by the rule,  that percentage cut had shrunk even  more-this time to 3.8 percent of con trollables.  Mr. Speakers, keep in mind that this  is the same CBO in which the Rosten kowski plan would vest exclusive au thority for determining the percent age reductions. And yet, in just 3 short  days, between November 5 and 8, CBO  revised downward its estimated reduc tions from 8.2 percent to 5 percent to  3.8 percent-a 53-percent change. In  CBO-doggy dollars, that's about a $21billion difference. That in itself should  be enough  to convince you that we  need  joint CBO-OMB  estimates of  deficits and reductions under Gramm Rudman-Rostenkowski.  Now, it could well be that Mr. FOLEY  asked CBO to make different assump tions than the current-law snapshot  required by the Gramm-Rudman and  Rostenkowski amendments. If so, he's  asking that we use the Rostenkowski  deficit, but not the Rostenkowski base line for calcuating that deficit.  But the fact remains, our Democrat ic colleagues agree that if they are to  be taken seriously about their $161-bil lion deficit figure for this fiscal year,  they should be willing now to make  the necessary reductions in our appro priations bills. The Foley amendment  to  the continuing  resolution  repre sents a symbolic start in that direc tion.  I say symbolic because this continu ing resolution only runs for some 3  weeks, until December 5. But, presum ably,  the Democratic  leadership  is  committing itself to making this defi cit figure stick in real money cuts if it  is  retained  in  the  final version of  Gramm-Rudman.  Mr. Speaker,  I  intend  to  reserve  final  judgment on the Foley amend ment pending an explanation  from  him as to how this will affect major  defense and nondefense categories. I  will point out, however, that I opposed  the $161 billion deficit figure put for ward  by House Democrats  in  the  Gramm-Rudman  conference.  It was  my belief then, as it is now, that we're  trying to do too much too soon with  this new process, and that if we try to  cut another $13 billion or so for the  last 9 months of this fiscal year, after  we're  already  gone  through  the  budget, appropriations, and reconcilia tion cycle we'll be straining this proc ess beyond the breaking point.  Now I know that's what some are  hoping-that either we  send  some thing to the President he can't sign, or  that is thrown out by the courts, or  that sinks under its own weight in the  first year. But I'm frankly interested  in something that is reasonable and  workable.  The key to the success of this proc ess  in not Presidential sequestering  across-the-board, but the threat of it  that will force Congress to set its own  spending priorities and meet these def icit goals during the regular budget  process, not after it is completed.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this  rule because we do need a further con tinuing resolution while we complete  action on our regular appropriations  bills. But  I would caution my col leagues to give careful consideration to  the  full  ramifications of  the Foley  amendment before  they embrace  it.  Let's make sure the author gives us a  complete  rundown on what  impact  this will have on our various domestic  and defense programs before we adopt  that amendment. Yes, we need a defi cit reduction program. But if it is not  well-reasoned and reasonable, we may  wind-up losing ground on the road to a  balanced budget.  D 1635  ",1985

1968,1285,22,Mr.  JEFFORDS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in reluctant opposition  to H.R.  1616, the Labor-Management Notifica tion and Consultation Act of 1985. My  reluctance stems both from  the tre mendous respect I have for  the au thors of this legislation, and from the  sympathy I have for their intent.  I fully support requiring employers  to provide advance notice of plant  closings whenever and wherever it is  feasible. Like perhaps every Member  of Congress,  sudden plant  closings  have had  a  devastating  impact on  people and communities in my State.  My support of notice, however, does  not lead me to support the provisions  of H.R.  1616, which  I  believe  are  flawed  in a  number of  respects.  I  intend to off er a substitute proposal  which attempts  to address some of  these flaws, and which, I believe, has a  greater chance of being enacted into  law.  The notice and other provisions of  H.R. 1616 are triggered by any em ployment loss for 50 or more employ ees, regardless of how large the plant  might be. I should note parenthetical ly that I use the word plant for illus tration only. The bill would cover any  business enterprise of 50 or more em ployees. The loss of 50 jobs in a town  of 500 would  indeed by devastating.  But it does not make sense to put into  motion the machinery of this bill for  the layoff of 50 employees at a mill  employing 5,000 people.  More  troublesome  than the notice  requirements of H.R. 1616 are the so called consultation provisions. It is the  intent of the bill's sponsors that em ployers be  required  to consult with  their employees before closing a plant  in order to find a means by which to  prevent that closing.  I certainly have no objection to that  intent, however, I am afraid that the  language  of H.R.  1616  goes well  beyond that intent. More than just a  consultation process,  the bill estab lishes a broader duty to bargain than  under current law, and even, it can be  argued, a duty to agree.  I would hope that every employer in  this country could involve his or her  employees in business decisions on an  ongoing basis so that this sort of con sultation would be routine. Yet there  are any number of reasons why a busi ness teetering on the brink might not  want to advertise that fact.  If an  employer,  after giving  the  matter a great deal of thought, decides  to close a plant or lay off some work ers in a product line. I think yes, de cency requires some notice be given.  But mandating good faith bargaining  by law just does not seem possible or  workable. The employer is in a nonwin  situation. If the employer decides to  close  the plant  and  then provides  notice, he or she is probably guilty of  bargaining in bad faith, since the deci sion had already been made.  It is  important  to remember  that  current law already requires bargain ing when a decision to close and relo cate hinges on labor costs. If that re quirement is not being honored, then  we should look at that discrete prob lem rather than this sweeping expan sion of an employer's duty to bargain  on a decision to close a plant.  The sponsors of H.R.  1616  argue  that their bill will not prevent the clo sure of any business. That may be  true, but I  think it may prevent the  opening of a number of businesses. If  a company is deciding were to locate a  new  f acllity,  this bill provides one  more reason to go to Mexico, Korea,  or Taiwan.  Moreover, the bill creates a series of  potential legal obstacles that would at  least delay, and might very well pre vent, a closing or layoff. I mentioned  earlier the duty  to bargain in good  faith, a duty which might be impossi ble to meet. Beyond that, there are  several  hurdles  an  employer must  overcome. First, notice must be given  90 days in advance. This period may be  shortened due to an unavoidable busi ness circumstance which will probably,  and perhaps inevitably, be litigated.  Second, once notice is given, the em ployer must provide all relevant inf or mation to the union. Sensitive inf or mation could be held back only with a  protective order from the Department  of Labor. Good  faith  consultation  would probably not commence until  all  information had been  supplied,  which means that the process of clos ing or  laying off might  take much  longer than 90 days.  Failure to give notice or consult in  good faith would be remedied through  injunctive relief sought by the Depart ment of Labor, or through an individ ual employees' private or class action.  An employer found responsible for an  unauthorized plant closing or layoff  would be liable for back pay and bene fits,  general and punitive damages,  and attorneys' fees.  Finally, H.R. 1616 authorizes a com mission  to study plant closings and  make  recommendations.  I  frankly  don't understand why we should legis late without the benefits of the find ings of such a commission. For that  reason,  along with my  colleagues  MARGE RoUKEMA and STEVE GmmER soN, I asked Secretary Brock to create  such a commission. He has now done  so, and I don't think anyone can fault  the caliber of  individuals who have  agreed  to serve on  the Brock  task  force. Creating a second commission  simply makes no sense.  Given my  objections  the  bill  before us, I intend to off er a substitute  at the appropriate  time. In brief, it  will require notice only, will be trig gered  in a somewhat more sensitive  fashion, and will sanction the Brock  task force. My substitute does not at tempt to prejudge the findings of that  task force, as it becomes effective 6  months after the task force  reports  those findings. At the same  time  it  allays the fears of those who are con cerned that the task force process will  drag on indefinitely by fixing a date  certain for enactment. It will not re quire consultation. But I think it will  stand a  better chance of  someday  being considered by  the other body  and the President.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to oppose the bill before them and to  support my substitute.  ",1985

1971,1298,22,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  very  strong  support of H.R.  1616,  the  Labor-Management NcJtification and Con sultation Act of 1985. Enactment of ""plant  closing'' legislation is long overdue and I  commend my  committee colleagues, Mr.  CLAY, and Mr. MARTINEZ, for their fine ef forts  in  reporting  this  legislation.  I also  want to thank Mr. CONTE for bringing a bi partisan  perspective  to  this  legislative  effort, and  in particular, I want  to  take  note of the  incredible effort of my col league, Mr. FORD, for his diligence and pa tience in pursuing this effort for well over  a decade. It is to their immense credit that  we are here today having, at last, recog nized that the human devastation and soci etal costs resulting from plant closings and  layoffs dese""e our immediate attention.  Mr. Chairman, in this short time I wish  to make three rather simple points; first,  that  the problems associated with plant  closings are not regional but, in fact, affect  every  region  and area of  this country;  second, that there are severe public conse quences to private sector disinvestment de cisions, and third, that an orderly and fair  process of adjustment to plant closings is  needed.  There is little doubt that the twin prob lems of plant closings and the resulting un employment have been with us in varying  degrees throughout our industrial history.  However, there is sufficient evidence that  the  contemporary  process  of  industrial  change and restructuring is unique, both as  to its nature and as to its sheer pace and  velocity. The market forces which  tradi tionally have  influenced employment and  industrial location patterns are being inten sified  by  the pressures of  international  competition. A study of my home State of  California, by Philip Shapira, of the Insti tute of Urban and Regional Development,  University of California, Berkeley,  illus trates  these  significant  differences. His  findings show that:        the growth and concentration of  transnational corporations and the ability  of these firms to shift capital have added a  new global dimension to industrial change.  Large firms now have an unprecedented ca pacity to coordinate and reorganize  their  production and investments not Just across  regions,  but  across  national  boundaries.  Second,  the  introduction of new  technol ogies  in production,  transportation,  and  communications allows new ways to organiz ing work, as well as increased levels of pro ductivity, that were not possible in earlier  periods.  The result of such a  rapidly changing  economic environment is a churning of em ployment  that throws millions of Ameri cans out of work each year.  These disruptions and dislocations are  too often only  seen as problems of the  Northeast or Midwest smokestack industri al regions of this country. While it is clear  that plant closures and  job  losses have  most heavily affected workers in such basic  industries  as  automobiles,  steel,  and  rubber, the problem  i1 not limited to any  particular region of thi1 country. Let me  again refer to  the 1tudy I quoted before  and uee my home State of California as an  example. Mr. Shapira, found:  Clln California, large-scale basic steel pro duction was established during the Second  World War, and had Just about left by the  1980's      Similarly, in the automobile in dustry, the period of most rapid growth in  California was during the 1950's and 1960's,  when General Motors and Ford built major  new assembly plants in the state and Cali fornia rose to third place among the States  in automobile output        Now, by  the  1980's, California vehicle production <to gether with  the associated production of  glass,  rubber, and other parts) has been  drastically reduced       In short, Callf omia  exemplifies the Juxtaposition of production  growth, change and decline.  California also illustrate   that as thi1 re structuring and realignment occurs, and no  matter how strong its economy is generally,  no region is spared the devastating after ef fects accompanying plant closures or major  layoffs. One need only review the 1984 BLS  Report on the number of displaced workers  located  in  the  three Far West States  to  measure the dimension of the problem we  are discussing here today.  Mr. Chairman, private sector disinvest ment decisions do have severe public conse quences which are not limited to the North east and Midwest regions of this country  but which, in fact, affect every part of this  Nation, and every  industry from  smoke stack  to high  technology, causing havoc  not only  to  the worker and his or her  family but to the community at large. Our  committee has heard frightening testimony  of the human despair suffered not only by  the worker but by his or her family not  only in terms of loss of financial security  but of tension, anxiety, and depression, re sulting in spouse and child abuse, deser tion, and divorce as well as a very high sui cide  rate. If ever  there was an  issue of  ""family"" this is it.  The surrounding community is also dev astated when a plant closes or a large por tion of the area's work force is layed off. It  will lose its tax base at a time when its citi zens are most in need of basic se""ices. The  societal costs are immense and readily ap parent in increased health care costs, costs  associated with the greater uee of unem ployment compensation, food stamps, and  other social support programs. It is  time  not only  to  recognize  the magnitude of  these economic changes but to deal with  the human  repercussions. Sufficient evi dence has been preeented to show that with  appropriate notice to the employee and to  the community such devastating effects of  a job loss can be minimized.  It is  the  intent of H.R. 1616, not  to  impede, halt or alter the economic develop ment that has made this country great nor  to infringe on a business decision of disin vestment, but rather to take cognizance of  the very human and very public and very  pe""asive effects that unfortunately seem  to go hand in hand with this new economic  expansion and development, and to provide  an orderly and fair process by which  to  leseen  the burden of these consequences.  H.R. 1616, is, in my view, only a start in the  right direction. But it is a first step that we  can no longer delay if we care at all about  the people who provide the human capital  for such economic development.  I  am  inserting  at  this  point  in  the  RECORD a  letter from my friend and col league  JOHN DINGELL,  chairman of  the  Committee on Energy and Commerce. That  committee might, had it choeen to do so,  have demanded sequential referral of H.R.  1616, but for the reasons indicated in his  letter, has choeen not to do so. I concur  fully with Mr. DINGELL's letter and I agree  that his action in this matter does not con stitute a waiver of jurisdiction and will not  be a precedent for the future.  ",1985

Gene Amole  in  the Rockey Mountain  News and Tom Gavin  in the Denver Post  wrote  fondly of  their good  friend Bob  Stapp.  [From The Rocky Mountain News. Nov. 3,  1985]  REMEMBERING A SUPERB WRITER  <By Gene Amole)  Anarchy.  When Ben Bezoff learned he had cancer  in 1978, Bob Stapp and I began  to have  lunch with him every week or so  to help  keep up his spirits. We'd meet at the Golden  Ox, spend a couple of hours eating, talking,  and having a few.  After Ben died, we were two.  Bob and I kept the tradition. It had a lot  to do with our affection for Ben. But of  course we had always enjoyed each other.  Have you noticed that as you grow older  how difficult it  is  to find people you can  really talk to?  Maureen Stapp, Bob's wife of 44 years,  called Friday to tell me he had died the  night before of a heart attack. He was 71.  She was grateful there was no suffering.  Now we are one.  What a superb writer he was! As a report er  for The Denver Post  and  the Rocky  Mountain News, Bob crafted some of the  sharpest, funniest satire any one has ever  done in this or any other town.  He was  particularly  deft  at  deflating  puffed politicos. Bob caused the defeat of a  powerful Colorado congressman simply by  accurately quoting him in a story for the  News. Bob put  in every pause, every stum ble, each snortle and every incomplete sen tence the old boy uttered in a speech.  Of government in general, Bob once asked  Charlie Roos, ""Over  the years everybody  has  badmouthed  anarchy,  but have we  really given it a chance?""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The circumstances of Bob's resignation  from  the Post  are worth  remembering.  After promising him he would cover  the  Democratic National Convention, Post man agement decided at the last minute to send  the son of the publisher instead.  Angry and hurt, Bob told City Editor Will  Haselbush he was quitting and stalked out  of the newsroom. Not wanting to lose one of  his most talented writers, Haselbush sent  another reporter, Thor Severson, to Bob's  house to try to talk him into coming back.  Bob was still in a rage when Severson ar rived. They went to the kitchen to talk. The  more Bob thought about it, the angrier he  got. It wasn't long before Severson became  as furious at the injustice as Bob. An hour  later, Severson picked up  the  telephone,  called the city desk and also quit.  After leaving ""the newspaper game,"" as  Bob called it, he wrote a novel, ""A More  Perfect Union,"" and worked in Washington  as an administrative assistant to Congress men Roy McVicker and Byron Rogers. He  was director of  information at Stapleton  International Airport and a political confi dante  and  strategist  for  former Denver  Mayor William McNichols.  For the record, his name was Robert R.  Stapp. But the name for which the middle  initial stood was not. He hated it and never  told anyone what it was.  Memorial services will be held 11  a.m.  Monday at the Church of the Risen Christ,  3090 S. Monaco Parkway.  Quote courtesy Tom Gavin: ""I have been  trying to live down my newspaper record for  20 years, but somebody always dredges it up  again. Actually, it wasn't even my fault in  the first place. Because I grew up in a poor  neighborhood, it was natural I would drift  into petty crime and then into the newspa per business.""-Bob Stapp.  [From The Denver Post, Nov. 3, 1985]  HIS DROLLERY LIVES AFTER HIM  like Bob  <By Tom Gavin)  Bob Stapp dead? Nah. People  Stapp don't die.  Oh, he is dead all right. Gone. Shuffled  off this mortal coil. Gone to glory. Clasped  in the arms of Jesus. Choose your own eu phemism.  Robert R. Stapp. Former newspaperman.  Former congressional aide. Former PR man  for Stapleton International Airport. Dead at  71 of an apparent heart attack.  He's not dead for me, though, and never  will be. Someone said we never die so long as  we are remembered and, whew, I'd hate to  think how many people have lively memo ries of this jasper.  No, make that laughing memories.  Say the word ""Stapp"" to an acquaintance  of Bob Stapp and probably that person will  smile. And then grin. And then laugh aloud  as  recall of some drollery works  its way  clear of the memory bank and breaks into  the open.  The last time I saw him he announced at  lunch that he'd been dieting and that he'd  lost 11 pounds and a ring from his finger  and went right into an entirely different  conversational line. With Stapp you had to  pay attention. You also had to keep your  left up and your chin tucked in to keep from  being tagged, for, like a lot of my friends,  now that I  think of it, he could pink you  with a little personal thrust, too, and never  change expression then, either.  ALL IN OUR PLACES  I'll be at Bob Stapp's memorial service at  11 a.m. Monday at the Church of the Risen  31529  Christ, 3090 S. Monaco. You bet. If there's  one thing I like it's a good laugh.  Sounds dreadful, doesn't it? Yeah. Excuse  me. But, listen, most of my friends are news papermen and they are a peculiar bunch.  They are seldom solemn at funerals. They  whisper wry, puckish things to one another,  usually about the dear departed, while in  the church proper, and, once outside, say  pretty much the same things aloud. There  are chortles and laughs. It is most unseem ly.  It's also healthy, I  think, for  tears and  chuckles are never far apart in this life, are  they? Does it hurt? Only when I laugh.  I didn't bring you here  to  talk about  friends who make you smile, though. Prob ably you've got your own set. What I wish  to do  is share a  few of  the  remarks of  Robert R. Stapp, recorded here and there  over the years.  LIKE THESE  As a candidate for mayor in 1959: ""My  campaign has contributed something to the  moral of the people. it's been a source of  limitless merriment.  I  feel  there  is now  greater solidarity among the citizens than  at any time since Pearl Harbor. Everyone's  against me.""  Addressing a meeting of newspaper edi tors: ""it is a high honor to be here with you  molders of public opinion. I must say you've  done a wonderful job. I doubt if public opin ion has ever been as moldy as it is today.""  Addressing his own Stapleton retirement  party: ""I see some of my ex-colleagues here  from my old newspaper days. These people  are  implacable.  I've retired  four or  five  times since then, but I can see they're going  to hound me to my grave. I've been trying  to live down my newspaper record for 20  years, but somebody always dredges it up.  And acutally it wasn't even my fault in the  first place, because  I grew up  in a poor  neighborhood and  it was natural  that  I  would drift into petty crime and then into  the newspaper business.""  Miss him? Yes. A lot. But he is not dead.  Forget that ""dead"" business.  Bob Stapp may live forever.  FOREIGN AGENTS COMPULSORY  ETHICS IN TRADE ACT OF 1985  HON. HOWARD WOLPE  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 1985  ",1985
2038,1415,22,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker, at a  time  when our Nation is struggling with a whole  range of trade problems that demand our  immediate attention, it is deeply troubling  to find that many of our former top-level  Government officials are on the payrolls of  foreign governments and foreign corpora tions. People who have had the privilege to  serve at the highest levels of our Govern ment have chosen to use the status, insid er's knowledge and special access they ac quired in office on behalf of foreign inter ests.  William Eberle, a former U.S. Trade Rep resentative, has represented Japan. Clark  Clifford, our former Secretary of Defense,  has represented the Mexican Foreign Min istry and Australian business interests. Wil liam Colby, former Director of the Central  ",1985
2039,1428,22,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, Cali fornia Gov. George Deukmejian devoted his  weekly radio program, ""California Report,""  to the subject of the key energy facilities in  our State. He  reported on his  statewide  tour of everything from  the Geysers geo thermal project near Santa Rosa  in  the  northern part of our State to the dispatch  center operated by  the San Diego Gas &  Electric Co. to the south. This was done as  part of Energy Awareness Week.  California  is a  large energy consuming  State, but it also has a wide diversity of  energy projects,  large and  small, which  span the range from traditional oil, natural  gas and hydropower  to solar, wind, geo thermal and coal gasification. Given  the  importance of protecting air quality and  other environmental considerations, Cali fornia must balance energy development  and the environment. The track record in  our State is that this can be done success fully.  It is my pleasure to serve as the ranking  minority member of the Energy and Com merce Subcommittee on Fossil and Syn thetic Fuels. In that capacity,  I want  to  echo the Governor's statement thatEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In recent years, we have learned the hard  way that we cannot bury our heads in the  sand when it comes to energy. The security  of our nation and the prosperity of our state  depend on a  stable, affordable supply of  power.  I commend the rest of the Governor's re marks to my colleagues' attention:  STATEMENT BY Gov. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN  Energy  is  the lifeblood of our economy  and our way of life. This week, California  has been observing Energy Awareness Week  of highlight this fact. It is a time to learn  more about our state's energy supply and  the important relationship between contin ued energy development and a strong, pros perous economy.  Most of us are familiar with more tradi tional energy resources such as oil, nuclear  and  hydroelectric  power. Yet within  a  decade, we expect that more than 25 per cent of our state's electrical needs will be  met by some of the less well known energy  sources, such as geothermal, wind and solar  power. This will give California the most di verse energy system in the world and pro vide us with an important insurance policy  against  future disruptions  in supply and  price.  This week, I had the opportunity to visit  some of California's dynamic energy produc tion facilities. In northern California, I vis ited the Geysers,  the world's largest geo thermal complex. Here,  the earth's heat  turns und~rground water into steam, which  is used  to drive  turbine generators  that  produce low-cost energy.  More than half of all of California's oil re serves are  in Kern County.  I  toured the  Kern River Cogeneration Plant, which pro duces both electricity and the steam needed  to recover the heavy oil from beneath the  earth's surface.  In the Mojave Desert near  the city of  Daggett, I toured two state-of-the-art power  facilities: a coal gasification plant, which  turns  coal  into  a  synthetic gas  that  is  burned  to produce  electricity;  and Solar  One, the world's largest solar-powered cen tral receiver.  The last stop on this educational journey  was a visit to San Diego Gas and Electric's  Dispatch Center. This vast communications  complex insures the delivery of an efficient  and stable power supply to more than 2 mil lion Southern California residents.  In recent years, we have learned the hard  way that we cannot bury our heads in the  sand when it comes to energy. The security  of our nation and the prosperity of our state  depend on a  stable, affordable supply of  power.  I'm very proud of California's energy in dustry. With determination and innovation,  the scientists, engineers and companies of  this industry have put California in a lead ership position. The energy  industry not  only  accounts  for nearly half  a million  direct jobs, but it powers our homes, offices,  schools and factories and enables our econo my to grow.  In my State of the State message last Jan uary. I said that an historic agreement was  near which will  allow us  to construct a  major  transmission  line  to purchase  low cost hydroelectric power from states in the  Northwest. These states have a surplus of  power. California needs that power which  can help meet our needs and  lower our  energy costs. I am pleased to announce that  the agreement, which is called the Califor nia-Oregon Transmission Project, has been  approved by Congress, signed by President  November 12, 1985  Reagan, and we are now moving ahead to  implement it.  Once in place, this project will save con sumers up to $250 million in energy costs  each year. It is good for the environment as  well, because the project could reduce the  need  for  constructing  additional  energy  plants.  While our policies emphasize production,  we fully recognize the importance of energy  conservation. Wasting energy not only costs  you money, but it costs your neighbors as  well-because greater energy demand puts  more upward pressure on energy rates.  It's interesting to stop and think just how  much you and your family depend on elec tricity in the home, workplace and schools,  not to mention gasoline for your car. Imag ine what life would be like without it. I am  determined to make sure that Californians  have a secure and affordable energy supply.  That's why we must continue to develop a  broad diversity of  energy  resources. We  cannot slam  the door on any promising  method of production as long as it is effi cient and environmentally safe.  I am confident that California will main tain  its  leadership  and diversity  in  the  energy field. This is the challenge we have  put to our scientists, engineers and energy  companies, and I believe they are meeting  this challenge. We will continue to encour age the most creative minds in the state to  scale even greater heights in producing safe,  clean and affordable energy.  Please join me next week for another Cali fornia Report. This  is Governor George  Deukmejian. Thanks for listening.  CHAIRMAN G.V. <SONNY) MONT GOMERY SPEAKS FOR AMERI CA'S VETERANS  HON. DOUGLAS APPLEGATE  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 1985  ",1985
2040,1428,22,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to place into  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the remarks  that were made by the distinguished chair man of the House Veterans' Affairs Com mittee, Hon. G.V.  (SONNY) MONTGOMERY,  on the occasion of Veterans Day, 1985. His  remarks were given on nationwide radio in  the Democratic response of last Saturday,  November 9.  Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that there  is no finer individual in the House of Rep resentatives when  it comes  to doing  the  very best for our former servicemen and  women. Chairman MONTGOMERY has been  and always will be a true inspiration to the  membership of the Veterans Mfairs Com mittee and to the millions of veterans and  their families in our Nation who have bene fitted because of his generous deeds. I ask  that every Member of the House take the  time to read the words of Chairman MONT GOMERY of Mississippi.  ",1985
2041,1441,22,Mr. BONIOR of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  since the election of President Duarte, we  have all hoped for a strengthening of de mocracy and the prospects for peace in El  Salvador. Yet, these hopes must not blind  us to that country's continuing war and the  suffering of its people.  Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans  have fled  to neighboring countries or the  United States, fearing for their safety. The  recent kidnaping of the President's daugh ter, and attacks by the Honduran military  on a Salvadoran refugee camp are graphic  illustrations of how violence threatens the  life of every Salvadoran.  Under such conditions,  it  is  imperative  for the United States to grant extended vol untary departure status to the Salvadorans  who have sought refuge in our country. I  commend Chairman MAzZOLI for the hear ings he held on this legislation last week.  And I urge my colleagues to support the   Moakley bill to grant Salvadorans a tempo rary stay of deportation.  UNOBLIGATED HOUSING FUNDS  WASTE OILS ARE HAZARDOUS  HON. MICKEY LELAND  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 1985  ",1985
2042,1441,22,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to take this time to raise a concern I have  relating to unobligated housing funds held  by the Department of Housing and Urban  Development. My concern centers on how  these  funds would be  treated under  the  Gramm-Rudman balanced budget amend ment.  The Council of Large Public Housing Au thorities has studied this situation and con cluded  that nearly $38 billion  in funding  held by HUD falls into the unobligated cat egory. This amount represents housing as sistance for more  than 1 million Ameri cans.  The Senate balanced-budget amendment  makes clear that unobligated funds, along  with  normal  appropriations  accounts,  would be subject to across-the-board spend ing cuts. The House-passed version exempts  these funds.  The main impact of cutting HUD's unob ligated funds would fall on the 1.1 million  very low income elderly and family tenants  who  lease private housing with rental as sistance from HUD through the local hous ing authority under section 8 programs.  This popular program, which closely resem bles the administration's voucher proposal,  allows  low-income people  to rent private  housing by paying a set percentage of their  income in rent, with the balance paid by  the Federal Government. This is an impor tant program as it allows many people to  escape the often horrendous conditions of  public housing projects, while not  losing  Federal assistance.  Each housing unit authorized to receive  a  rental subsidy under  this program has  such  funds  appropriated  on  a  15-year  schedule. HUD has chosen administratively  to obligate funds only for the first 5 years  and place the remainder in an uncommit ted reserve. Funds in this reserve are then  paid out  in 5-year  intervals. Thus,  these  funds that have been legislatively appropri ated and committed to assistance of low income tenants, nevertheless appear unob ligated in the HUD ledgers.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is clear that to expose  these unobligated HUD funds to the auto matic  sequestering mechanism  of  the  Gramm-Rudman plan would result in the  dislocation of hundreds of thousands of  poor and elderly tenants. In this time when  hundreds become homeless each day, we, as  responsible  legislators, should not  lend a  hand in forcing people  into the streets. I  urge my colleagues on the conference com mittee to pass the House version of the bal anced-budget  amendment  and  exempt  HUD's unobligated funds from automatic  cuts.  HON.THOMASJ.DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 12, 1985  Mr. DOWNEY of New York. Mr. Speak er, a critical question in the debate over the  reauthorization of Superfund that we will  soon consider on the House floor  is who  should pay to clean up abandoned and out of-control toxic waste sites.  In 1980 we decided that the revenue for  Superfund should come, to the extent pos sible, from those segments of industry and  consumers most responsible for  imposing  risks arising from hazardous waste on soci ety. This year we must significantly expand  the scope and funding of Superfund but we  must not abandon the ""polluter must pay""  philosophy  for  Superfund. The  current  taxes on chemical f eedstocks and crude oil  should be expanded and combined with a  waste management tax and a share of gen eral revenues to retain our original intent  for the program.  In considering Superfund financing, it is  important to remember who and what con tributes to the toxic waste crisis facing this  country today. One source of the problem  is petroleum and its byproducts. Petroleum  wastes including waste oil have been found  at over 100 hazardous waste sites identified  by EPA as candidates for Superfund clean up.  I urge my colleagues to read  the at tached article on the dangers of waste oil  that recently appeared  in  the New York  Times as they consider who should pay for  Superfund.  [From the New York Times, Nov. 9, 19851  EPA RESTRICTING USE OF WASTE OIL AS F'uEL  <By Philp Shabecoff)  WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.-The Environmental  Protection Agency announced  restrictions  today on the selling and burning of used oil  containing contaminated waste. It said the  use of such oil as fuel could cause cancer  and other illnesses.  The rule, which will go into effect within  the next two weeks, would ban the burning  of all such oil containing more than speci fied levels of toxic chemicals and metals.  Some  500 million  gallons  of  used  oil  burned each year in about 30,000 residen tial,  institutional and commercial boilers.  This oil amounts to less than 1 percent of  the nation's fuel.  The burning of waste oil as fuel has been  regarded as a particularly significant prob lem in large cities such as New York. Repre sentative Bill Green, a Manhattan Republi can, had pressed the environmental agency  to have controls in place by this winter.  ""In our city, especially in Manhattan, our  problem is not waste in the ground but in  the air,"" Mr. Green said today. He said the  rules were needed ""so we can avoid breath ing poisons this winter.""  Although the burning of waste oil con taminated by toxic substances has long been  recognized as a health threat, the law on  handling and disposing of toxic wastes al lowed the continued use of such wastes as  fuel supplements. Congress barred the prac tice last year: the rule issued today will put  the Congressional ban into effect.  ",1985
