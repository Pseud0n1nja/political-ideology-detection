0,House,99,-0.242,15,3,Mr. ECKART.,"  The Consumer Rail Equity Act of  1985 will assure that shippers and con sumers who have no alternative  to  transportation on a single railroad are  protected from abusive railroad pric ing practices and assures further that  competition between railroads is maxi mized. In 1980, when the Congress en acted the Staggers Rail Act, railroad  rates for captive shippers-those ship pers without  transportation alterna tives-were not deregulated. The Con gress recognized that captive shippers  were without market alternatives, and,  thus, could not rely on market forces  to discipline  rates. Therefore, Con gress directed the ICC to provide regu latory protection  for  such  shippers  after their rates reached a certain ju risdictional  level which assured that  captive shippers would make a  sub stantially greater contribution to rail road revenue needs than would ship pers with competitive alternatives.  Captive shippers do not complain  about  the basic decisions made by  Congress in 1980. Nonetheless, captive  shippers complain bitterly  that  the  ICC is not providing the protections  required by the Staggers Act-either  because  our  instructions were  not  clear in 1980 or because the Commis sion refuses to accept the need for the  balanced implementation that was en visioned  in Staggers. The result has  often been unreasonably high  rates  being paid to railroads which the ICC  considers to be revenue inadequate al though these same railroads appear to  be financially sound to most observers.  The result has been particularly dif ficult for States like my own which are  in the process of shifting from natural  gas and petroleum as their basic elec tric utility fuel to the use of coal as a  primary fuel. During the mid-1970's,  following the Nation's disastrous crude  oil supply interruption, Federal policy  called for utilities to shift to coal as a  primary fuel and, where possible,  to  low sulfur coal to avoid environmental  problems. As many of our utilities en tered  the coal market for  the first  time in the late 1970's, they encoun tered great difficulty. The experience  of Cajun Electric Power Cooperative,  Inc. is typical of a number of experi ences in my region.  Cajun Electric is a nonprofit rural  electric generation and  transmission  company that provides power to 1 mil lion Louisianans through 13 member  cooperative distribution companies. In  the late 1970's, Cajun, which needed  additional power generation, turned to  Wyoming's Powder River basin,  the  principal source of low sulfur coal in  our  country. Cajun  had  relatively  little difficulty obtaining a competitive  long-term coal contract from the nu merous coal producers  in the basin.  Unfortunately, however, only one rail road, the Burlington Northern [BNJ,  was available to move the coal to Lou isiana.  The Cajun officials recognized their  vulnerability and attempted to negoti ate a  long-term agreement with the  BN, even though the legal authority  of the BN to enter into long-term con tracts was questionable. After receiv ing assurances from the BN and reach ing an agreement pursuant to which  the BN agreed to move the coal from  Wyoming  to Louisiana  for $10.53  a  ton, beginning March 1,  1979, with  only escalation of the rate for infla tion, Cajun executed a long-term coal  contract in the Powder River basin.  Unfortunately, within a year after  March 1, 1979, BN had raised the rate  three times to $12.54 a ton, a 20-per cent increase. From the middle of 1980  to January 1, 1983, the BN increased  its rates six more times to $18.13 a ton.  The nine increases between March l,  1979 and January l, 1983 amounted to  a  total increase of approximately 73  percent. During this same period, in flation adjustments would have yield ed an increase of only about 36 per cent or a rate of approximately $15 in  January 1983.  Until mid-1984, Cajun had no com petitive alternative  to  the BN. Last  year, after years of struggle, the Chi cago  &  Northwestern  Railroad  [ C&NWJ was able  to overcome  the  BN's opposition and obtain an  ICC  order enabling the C&NW to provide  competition  to BN  in part of  the  Powder River basin. Although Cajun's  coal was not in that portion of the  basin, Cajun was finally able, in the  last few months, after threatening to  break its contract, to obtain a contract  for  rail haulage at more reasonable  rates.  Others have. not been so fortunate  and nothing assures that Louisiana's  consumers will be as fortunate with  our future coal needs. Most notably,  the system of law we established in  1980 did not protect Cajun and would  not be protecting Cajun today if they  were still subject to tariff rates. One  additional  factor  that makes  these  rates hard to take is that the justifica tion of ever higher rates for captive  shippers is the need to obtain revenue  adequacy  for our Nation's railroads.  Yet, to most observers, based on the  performance of their stock, their bond  ratings and  their  recent acquisition  history, the BN appears to be revenue  adequate. The  ICC has consistently  determined that the BN is revenue in adequate, however, ever since the en actment of the Staggers Act.  The Consumer Rail Equity Act will  provide protection for the Cajun's of  the world by assuring that the ICC  uses a more accurate revenue adequacy test; by providing that the railroad,  rather than the captive shipper, must  prove  that a  captive shipper's chal lenged rate is reasonable, and by pro viding a more equitable ""rate reason ableness"" test than the test being ap plied by the ICC.  Many of my constituents are en countering a  second problem under  the present  implementation of  the  Staggers Rail Act. Shippers that have  access to two or more rail systems are  protected by marketplace competition  and want nothing more than to retain  their railroad shipping options. Unfor tunately, shipper access to more than  one rail system often depends upon  the railroads willingness and ability to  enter into arrangements that facilitate  competition. Among  these  arrange ments are  the quoting of  joint and  proportional rates,  reciprocal switch ing agreements and arrangements con cerning the use of terminal facilities.  These arrangements have been cus tomary  in  the railroad  industry for  decades.  In the Staggers Act, Congress pro vided the ICC with discretionary au thority to order these arrangements at  reasonable prices when the shippers  could show that these arrangements  were necessary  to preserve and en hance competition. Unfortunately, the  ICC has not been exercising these au thorities, even when shippers made  the requisite showings. The Consumer  Rail Equity Act  assures maximum  competition between the railroads by  making  the  ICC authority  in  these  areas mandatory after  the shippers  make appropriate showings. For those  of us like myself who believe in regula tion by the marketplace, the railroads  cannot have it both ways: They cannot  have both deregulation and reduced  competition.  Finally, the Consumer Rail Equity  Act  addresses  four  other  areas  in  which problems have been  encoun tered under the Staggers Act. The bill  restricts  the ability of  the  ICC  to  exempt rail traffic from regulation in  those instances in which the ICC finds  a lack of railroad ""market dominance""  and makes the ICC exemption author ity discretionary rather than mandato ry. At least two of the recent ICC ex emption actions have been overturned  by the court of appeals.  Second, the bill expands the goals of  the Staggers Act  implementation  to  include the attainment of competitive  transportation rates for both domestic  energy sources and domestically pro duced agricultural commodities. The  ICC  is  required, under both present  and proposed law, to make affirmative  findings  that  captive  shipper  rates  that it finds to be reasonable are con sistent with the achievement of the 15  stated national objectives.  Third,  the  bill  assures  that  the  proper balance is struck between the  ",1985

I ob serve that on our recent trip to Israel  there was no person in our delegation  or in my opinion in Congress who has  traveled about  the country bringing  this matter  to  the attention of the  public at large any more than has the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  COELHO]. I congratulate him for his ef forts.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle man from Hawaii [",1985
2,House,99,-0.419,28,3,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the distinguished Congressman from  Maryland  [Mr. HOYER],  for yielding  and commend him  for coordinating  today's special order in support of the  spirit  and defiance  of Soviet  Jews  seeking  emigration  and  justice  at  home even in the face of persecution. I  would also like to extend my apprecia tion to all of our colleagues who have  proposed time to address this impor tant  issue.  I want  to  particularly  thank all  those associated with  the  Anti-Defamation League who helped  me realize the feelings of a struggling,  new nation.  Article I of the Constitution of our  great Nation states thatCongress shall make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  free exercise thereof; or abridging the free dom of speech, or of the press; or the right  of the people peaceably to assemble, and to  petition the Government for a  redress of  grievances.  Fortunately, and we hope and pray  eternally, as citizens of the free socie ty of the United States, we all benefit  from these few lines.  Today, as we stand here, we cannot  possibly deny that we are thankful for  those rights, and we certainly do not  take them for granted. For ,today, we  choose  to  sound  the alarm  to  the  Soviet Union that we stand in defiance  of the persecution, repression, and dis regard for human rights and liberties  which run rampant in that nation's so ciety. Likewise,  today, we choose  to  ally ourselves with those members of  Soviet society who continue to face up  to  those  systematic  attacks,  even  armed with  the knowledge  that the  end result shall only mean personal  tragedy.  My fell ow colleagues, it is true that  there is agonizingly little that we may  hope to do today about the serious de velopments  affecting  Soviet  Jewry.  Perhaps, we convene today only in the  hope  that we will be  recognized as  people who will not ignore the treat ment of Soviet Jews, who will not  stand by quietly while others fight for  fundamental  liberties, who  do  not  sanction the steadily worsening situa tion of anti-Semitism to which we are  now witnesses. We all know about the  desperate  emigration  situation with  which many Soviet Jews are faced-al though approximately 10 percent, or  260,000, of the Soviet Union's Jewish  population left the country between  1968 and 1981, only 896 managed to  get out  last year. Likewise, we are  aware of  the countless others who  have indicated their desire to leave the  Soviet Union by initiating the process  of applying for a visa.  In addition to the problem of emi gration, an even greater threat, anti semitism, has developed. We already  know that Soviet policy affects Jewish  religious practices-teaching  religion  to persons under 18 is illegal, there are  no seminaries in the U .S.S.R. to train  rabbis, and Jewish religious texts and  ritual objects are not produced in the  Soviet Union. We  also  know  that  teaching Hebrew is not recognized by  Soviet authorities as a legitimate pro fession, and  that the  language may  not be taught or studied by Jews, al though it is available to certain non Jewish citizens. Should these facts not  be sufficient enough to impress upon  us the great oppression which many  Soviet Jews must face, the recent wave  of  anti-Jewish  attacks  on Hebrew  teachers  should  serve  as  adequate  proof.  As early as July 26, 1984, the Soviet  crackdown on Jewish cultural activi ties began with the arrest of Moscow  Hebrew  teacher  Aleksandr  Khol miansky on the charges of hooligan ism. Following a search of the home  Kholmiansky shared with his parents,  authorities  elevated  his  charge  to  ""weapons  possession,""  claiming  to  have found a gun and ammunition on  the premises. A close friend of Khol miansky's,  also  a Moscow Hebrew  teacher, Yuliy Edelshtein, was arrest ed after a police search of his apart ment turned up narcotics. On January  29, 1985, a State Department report  revealed that ""there is no reason to  doubt the assertions of close relatives  that  in both cases  the  items were  planted by the police.""  Frankly, it would be easy for me to  stand here  for hours  reiterating a  number of similar stories which reveal  that,  in  fact,  the Soviet Union  is  making a concentrated effort to de stroy the remnants of Jewish educa tion and culture. This is  the funda mental  threat which  such  judicial  action represents. In this case, it is not  only the personal welfare of the indi viduals which  is  at stake, but  the  larger, more devastating threat lies in  the apparent intentions of Soviet au thorities to indict not only the individ uals on  trial, but  Jewish  tradition  itself. We are witnessing,  therefore,  the gradual deterioration and near ex tinction of an  institutional  form of  cultural and religious life.  This is the situation to which each  and every one of us must be attuned.  In so doing, we may choose either to  turn our heads in abeyance, or we may  voice  our disappointment  and near  contempt  for  the  inhumane  and  unjust activities to which we are all  observers. Today,  I  have chosen  to  follow the second route. I join my col leagues here on the floor of this great  institution not only  to  rebuke  the  Soviet Union for its denial of funda mental human rights, but also to pay  special  tribute  to  those  individuals  who have chosen to fight for  those  rights. Rejecting  the persistent  as saults on their dignity, refusing to re nounce  their  Jewish  identification,  and observing the religion,  language,  history, and culture for which their  predecessors  have  continuously  fought,  those individuals deserve our  full support and our highest praise. As  their counterparts in other countries  of the world struggle to maintain their  historic  identities,  so  too  do  the  Jewish citizens of  the Soviet Union  fight for the right to preserve what  little they have left.  I have recently witnessed the true  strength of the Jewish heritage, reli gious and cultural life, as a guest of  the Anti-Defamation League  on  a  firsthand basis. During my first and  recent trip  to Israel, I observed the  lifestyle of a people who have for far  too  long been  the victims of harsh  human rights abuses. A people who  have continued  to  rally against  the  pulverization of their institutional life  and the near obliteration of their very  consciousness, a people who refuse to  stop fighting until their existence is  assured. We visited with the highest  government  leaders,  the educational  leaders, and rubbed shoulders with the  regular people on the streets of Jeru salem. The Israel which I saw is an  Israel of democracy. This great demo cratic nation is one of which we may  be proud, a brotherhood in which we  should be proud to render our assist ance.  It does not surprise me that many  Soviet Jews hope to someday emigrate  to Israel, where they can freely prac tice their traditional lifestyles. Howev er, even if we surmise that what Soviet  Jewish communities want is  to rees tablish and renovate their oppressed  culture, then why should they not be  allowed that right? Why should they  not be allowed to exercise the right to  stay and live the way they want, to  exist as a cultural entity. If this is in  fact  favorable  to many Soviet Jews,  then  it  is up  to us  to  implore  the  Soviet Union for denying  this right,  and for continuing an unconscionable  ",1985
3,House,99,-0.3,41,3,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker, Soviet  Jews  comprise  the  third largest surviving Jewish commu nity  in the world. Soviet Jews have  been  struggling  to  achieve  basic  human rights,  including the right to  maintain their own religion and cul ture. The right to leave any country  that denies one their heritage  is an  internationally  recognized  human  right, yet in the Soviet Union permis sion to emigrate is given arbitrarily.  I believe that it is important that in  the face of this wave of anti-Semitism,  America must  reaffirm our commit ment to human rights. The U.S. Con gress has been a leading supporter of  Soviet Jews in their attempts to study  and teach their faith.  We have held ""Congressional Prayer  Vigils"" on behalf of Soviet Jews, but  we must be sure that the vigil contin ues  each and  every day 1-mtil  the  human rights of all Soviet Jews have  been restored.  As a Member of Congress and con cerned citizen, I have adopted a Soviet  Jewish  family  from  the Ukraine  to  help them fulfill their dream of emi grating to Israel.  Samuel and Manya Klinger have  been  trying  unsuccessfully,  for  a  number of years, to emigrate to Israel.  Samuel Klinger is an agronomist from  Dnepropetrovsk  in  the Ukraine. He  and his wife, a nurse by profession,  have been repeatedly denied exit visas  since 1970. The only reason given by  Soviet authorities has been a  lack of  consent  from Manya's parents, who  have not seen their daughter in many  years. Manya, a mother herself,  re cently celebrated her 50th birthday.  The Klinger situation is quite press ing in that they are the only family in  Dnepropetrovsk  awaiting  exit visas.  Recently,  a  defamatory  letter was  printed in a local newspaper about the  family-prompting Samuel to immedi ately send a  letter of protest to the  editor. The result was the printing of  another  anti-Semitic  article  in  the  same paper.  We have asked the Soviet Govern ment to grant this family permission  to emigrate, but have received no re sponse. There can be no doubt that by  not allowing the Klingers to leave the  Soviet Union, the Soviet Government  is  in clear violation of the Helsinki  Final Act,  the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, as well as  their  Soviet Constitution.  Surely the emigration of the Klinger  family would pose no threat to the se curity of the Soviet Union, and instead  would be a humanitarian gesture. Yet  permission  to  leave  is  continually  denied.  As the leader in the free world, the  United States must do all that we can  to protect  the human  rights of all  people. And I urge my colleagues to  continue to protest the blatant viola",1985
4,House,99,0.416,54,3,Mr. GROTBERG.," I thank the gen tleman from Georgia for yielding to  me.  Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting my  opportunity to speak up on behalf of  our friend, Rick Mcintyre. But I have  also been waiting  to speak out  for  what I observe as one of the biggest  aberrations of  the domestic process  that I have seen in my 12 elections I  have been through. I am from Illinois,  Mr. Speaker, and we all know about  elections in Illinois.  We know that they can come and go,  chicanery  is not a new word in the  State of Illinois and its election proc ess. But when the winners win, they  are seated, and then we go about the  people's business.  One of my concerns is, and I was re minded yesterday morning going  to  the church services that many of us go  to Ash Wednesday, I was reminded of  the words of our Lord who said rather  explicitly: ""In that ye have done it  unto one of  the  least of  these, my  brethren, you have done it unto me.""  I  think all 433 Members of  this  House are at stake in this basic princi ple of  justice by democracy and by  democratic action in the ballot box.  Mr. Speaker, I think Marcellus said  it rather well  to Horatio,  the great  Dane in that big castle, when he said:  ""Me thinks there is something rotten  in the State of Denmark.""  Those are the kinds of words that I  heard last week, 10 days I was home in  the field working with my voters. And  you  know what? Way out  in  the  middle of Illinois; not in Indiana, they  are beginning  to  ask  questions  on  other things besides the budget and  the farm bill. They are beginning to  ask ""What's the matter with that Con gress?""  We  all get blamed, Mr. Speaker.  What  is  the matter with that Con gress, that 500,000 people in the south western part of Indiana are not on  board yet? We have been answering  our mail; the letters from there come  in by a hundred or two a day; they  have no one  to write  to. What has  happened to this system? Is it 30 years  of power that would corrupt? Is it that  absolute power corrupts absolutely?  I hope not, Mr. Speaker. The worthy  opposition consists of fine people rep resenting  their  legislative  districts,  much as you and I represent ours.  If the gentleman from Georgia CMr.  GINGRICH] would understand,  along  with the rest of the world, that just a  few months ago we sent our Army and  Navy in to liberate a country of less  than 500,000 people; Grenada.  Margaret Thatcher was here yester day. A few months before she sent the  British Navy down to take back the  Falkland Islands because of basic dis agreements  in  how  government  is  going to be run.  Good heavens, I do not want, Mr.  Speaker,  for  us  to  compare  those  chemistries with the chemistry that is  going on here. The solution for this  problem lies right in this House. It lies  right in the hands of the leadership of  this House. It lies in the hands of the  gentlemen on the election committee  that has been appointed, and those de cisions have to made.  The injury that has been done has  been done. Our comrade-in-arms still  waits to be seated. That is not fair; it  is unjust, un-American.  I was around when Truman was a  member of the Un-American Activities  Committee, one of the great Demo cratic leaders of our time. I wonder if  he is turning over in his grave now as  he looks about what is going on in his  old Congress of these United States.  Very  un-American  activities  can  happen right in this Chamber, and I  challenge the great leaders of the op position that enough is enough, and  that the people of America are begin ning to ask, Mr. Speaker: Why don't  we get on with the people's business?  There are States in this Union that  do not have 500,000 people in them,  that have 2 Senators and a Represent ative seated in this body. And yet we  deny a half a million people the basic  right to join with us in deciding the  important issues.  Can you imagine living in southwest ern Indiana and not have your Con gressman vote on the farm bill in time  for the spring seeding in March, if the  Senate gets it over here today? We will  be doing something.  It is just basically unfair. I deplore it  personally, but on behalf of the rest of  the people of America and my district  in particular, we object  to what  is  going on.  ",1985
5,House,99,0.377,54,3,Mr. GINGRICH.," I thank the gentle man for bringing these points out. As  you mentioned, you do have a distin guished  record of having  run  in a  number of  elections;  you do  know  what it is like to deal in a situation  with very close elections.  In clcsing, let me say that I  think  one of the most amazing distortions  and deliberate deceptions which some  people in some places have been talk ing about as it relates to this election  in Indiana is this question of the votes  that were not counted.  Let me  quote  again  Kuebler, who said:  from Helen  Legislators passed the laws for Indiana,  not to count the ballot if it is not initialed  or does not have the ward and precinct.  <This is to prevent ballot-box stuffing, or il legal voting.) We upheld these laws in the  recount.  In other words, many of the people  whose ballots were not counted may  never have voted;  it may not have  been people. It may have been local  ballot box stuffing.  ",1985

Mayor Cathy Brown is  Clinton's first woman mayor and also  the youngest ever elected to fill  the  post, but as those of us who know her  and work with her realize, she would  have gained distinction as a local offi cial even without being a ""first,"" or  ""youngest.""  Mayor Brown comes  from a  long time, well-known, and well-liked Clin ton family. She has proven herself to  be a success in several professional ca reers, and has done an excellent job at  building up and maintaining the real  estate business she took over from her  late father.  In an article recently published in  Tennessee Town and City, it is clear  that her dedication to both her com munity and to her business and civic  activities is sure to help her along the  way  toward fulfilling a goal she ex presses, and that is:  ""10 years from  now, I would like to hear it said that I  was not just the youngest and the first  woman mayor, but the best.""

34,Senate,99,-0.322,158,3,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President,  I  am  today  introducing  legislation which  represents a continuation of  the ef forts  of  the  distinguished Senator  from Iowa-Mr. GRASSLEY-and myself  to eliminate a problem with the Gov ernment  procurement  process  com monly ref erred to as  the ""Revolving  Door."" I am also pleased to have Sena tors SIMON, GORE and HARKIN as origi nal cosponsors of my bill.  I want to commend my colleague in  the House of Representatives, Con gresswoman  BARBARA  BOXER,  who  today will introduce very similar legis lation in that body. I find it encourag ing and significant that Members on  both sides of  the Capitol and both  sides of the aisle are convinced of the  need for  legislation, and are in fact,  leading the way for reform.  The revolving door problem mani fests itself when Government procure ment personnel leave their jobs and go  to work shortly thereafter for the very  same contractor over whom they had  contract authority. The appearances  of conflict of interest and favoritism  have been many, and have been cited  by the p:ress, and by other Members of  Congress. Our intent with this bill is  to remove the potential for procure ment personnel  to show contractors  favor in order to secure employment  with that contractor in the future.  Our bill would require as a part of  all Government contracts a standard  clause which  all  contractors must  agree to when they do business with  an agency of  the U.S. Government.  This clause would prohibit a contractor from hiring a Federal employee or  member of the uniformed services who  had substantive procurement responsi bility relative to that contractor for a  period of 5 years from the termination  of that contract. If the contract period  should exceed the separation date of  the employee  in question,  then  the  prohibited period would be 5 years  from the date of that separation.  Each contractor must report to the  Government agency of the former em ployee that that employee has been  hired if that is the case within 5 years.  The Inspector General of the agency  and the Director of the Office of Gov ernment Ethics shall have access  to  these  reports.  The Director  shall  submit an annual report to Congress.  Our intent is not to simply discour age the practice of employees resign ing  to  accept questionable  employ ment. We want it stopped, as do tax payers. This is why our bill contains  stiff  damages  for  violations which  would be assessed against the contrac tor and determined by multiplying the  employee's annual  salary  times  the  number of days he or she worked in  violation of the law.  Mr. President, the Project on Mili tary Procurement released a series of  documents this week which indicates  that certain military personnel are  acutely aware of the problems which  occur when their coworkers go to work  for contractors over whom they have  previously had contract authority.  I  find the concerns of those inside the  system especially pertinent as we con sider the need for this type of bill.  Included in these documents was a  report prepared by an Office of Gov ernment Ethics  representative, Mr.  Jack Covaleski,  relative  to his visit  with Col. Jack Finder, Staff Judge Ad vocate, at the Air Force Contract Man agement Division CCMD]. The CMD is  responsible  for  administering  over  $100 billion of Air Fore~ contracts.  Most of this work is performed at 32  Air Force plant representative offices  CAFPROl  located on major defense  contractor plants.  The  following excerpt  documents is as follows:  these  from  Colonel Finder said that the major prob lem issues he finds are in the areas of post  employment, outside employment, and ac ceptance of gratuities.  Concerning  post  employment,  Colonel  Fisher said that 18 U.S.C. 207 and our regu lations do not deter the types of post em ployment problems typical of the Depart ment of Defense. There is a large turnover  of CMD personnel, especially of AFPRO of fices, who leave to work for contractors. For  example, the head of AFPRO office at Nor throp on Friday could become the Northrop  Vice President  for Quality Assurance on  Monday and immediately AFPRO employee  morale is destroyed. Employees openly dis cuss what the former employee has done  over the past few years for the contractor in  order to obtain the new  job, and wonder  why they themselves should be so ethical.  AFPRO employe""s must deal with  their  former  employee daily on many matters  <Government appearing before and seeking  data from the contractor> and feel betrayed  that the contractor now has all the inside  knowledge of how  the AFPRO operates.  Colonel Finder said these types of cases are  devastating to the ethics program because  of  the appearance of conflict of  interest  alone.  The Project on Military Procure ment also obtained a copy of a sugges tion Capt. Jeff Rohm made  in 1981  during his tenure as a staff judge ad vocate for the AFPRO at Pratt and  Whitney.  I  ask unanimous  consent  that the letter which Captain Rohm  sent  to  his Congressman  after he  made this suggestion be made a part  of the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  9020 SE HOBE RIDGE AVENUE,  Hobe Sound, FL, April 14, 1982.  Representative L.A. BAFALIS,  The Capitol Building,  Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN BAFALIS: Recently  I  submitted a suggestion to the Air Force call ing for a revision to an Air Force regulation  entitled ""Standard of Conduct for Govern ment Employees."" <See Atch 1.> Basically, I  proposed that key Air Force personnel in  sensitive positions of cognizance over a con tractor should be prohibited for a reasona ble  time after  their Government service  from employment with that contractor. The  Air Force regulation and the U.S. Code are  both ultimately directed  toward the same  goal-preserving the public's confidence in  the integrity of Government employees. As  an Air Force officer and attorney assigned  to a contractor's facility, <Pratt & Whitney  Aircraft> I have witnessed the reactions of  contractor employees and Government per sonnel when key  employees or officers,  often in sensitive, adversarial positions vis-a vis contractor, leave the Government and go  directly to work for that contractor. Regard less of any actual impropriety, the percep tion exists that perhaps such  individual's  past decisions were influenced by their pro spective employment.  I think this problem is common to all DoD  agencies, and not just the Air Force. In in formal conversations with reviewers of my  suggestion, they acknowledged the problem  but felt an Air Force regulation could not  solve it. <See Atch 2.) Accordingly, I appeal  to you for your support in plugging this se rious loophole by DoD directive, statute, or  perhaps some other way. The current law's  gap makes it worthy of attention.  I recognize, as noted in Atch 2, we should  defer  to  the ""careful  judgment of Con gress."" But I've seen nothing in the legisla tive history to indicate Congress intended to  ignore the problem. I also wonder whether  restricting employment of carefully selected  individuals in key positions for a reasonable  time vis-a-vis only a handful of contractors  raises ""serious questions about a person's  right to pursue a  livelihood and associate  with others."" In 18 USC 281, eg., while there  is a question about the artfulness of its lan guage, <See Field v. Brown 28 CCF 80,871  <D.C. D. Ct. 26 Nov 80)), there is no question  the Government may <and should) reason ably prohibit retired officers from selling to  their  former  services.

35,Senate,99,0.687,171,3,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. President, a few  months ago Idaho lost one of its most  respected citizens, Tom Campbell. A  journalist by trade, Tom was the recipient of many awards,  including  the  Idaho Press Club's annual award for  feature writing in 1965. <He was the  first recipient.) Though he was a re spected reporter, Tom is most warmly  remembered for his weekly columns  and features, some of which comprise  his book, ""The Contemplative Stroll er.""  There have been Campbells in the  newsroom of  the Lewiston Morning  Tribune since 1910. Tom's father was a  long-time reporter with the Tribune;  his mother also wrote for the paper.  ""Young Tom"" carried a proud tradi tion.  Tom lived a life ""in defense of con templation and a slow pace."" He did so  despite a busy schedule. Not only did  he write, but he also received acclaim  as an actor. Tom was one of the found ers of the Lewiston Civic Theater, and  appeared in more than 30 plays. He  was awarded the Theater's Best Actor  Award in 1983 for his performance in  ""On Golden Pond."" Somehow, he also  found time to paint.  But he is best remembered as the  self-proclaimed ""contemplative stroll er"" along the Lewiston levee, amused  by grimacing joggers like myself. Tom,  on  the other hand, was one of the  strollers who watched ""the birds, the  sky,  the  sun,  the water and  each  other."" This was the world Tom knew  better than most of us. And he knew  how to show us that world with his  words. If he had given us that only, he  would have contributed much.  Mr. President, I ask that the follow ing articles  from  the Contemplative  Stroller be printed into the RECORD.  Contemplative strollers today might  run across Tom's tombstone.  I hope  Idahoans  run  across  his work  for  many, many years to come.  Tom's book,  ""The Contemplative  Stroller,"" serves as a lasting tribute to  his life. Look it up sometime in the Li brary of Congress, cataloged F 754 .L6  C35.  The article follows:  A GENERATION OF Two-WHEELERS  There are still those around town who tell  me they remember my father riding his bi cycle, his trouser leg wrapped tight by a clip  so it wouldn't get wound in the chain, his  head arched above a stiff detachable cellu loid collar that held his neck in a vice, a  conservative gray fedora pulled down to just  above his eyebrows and a sea of paper con taining tomorrow's news floating in and pro truding from his pockets.  I, too, retain the memory.  During his half century with the Tribune,  my father had five bicycles. The last one  was retired during World War II, officially  because he couldn't get spare parts, but ac tually because his old legs were giving out.  The first bike was stolen a few days after  he purchased it in 1904, the year he arrived  in town from Butte, Mont. The second bicy cle, which was of poor construction,  fell  apart when it hit bottom in a pothole with  aboard,  an  occurrence  that  is  not  known upon the streets of Lewiston to this  very day.  him  The third bicycle was a gift from the Trib une, a magnificent ""wheel"" as my father  called bicycles. It cost $60. He parked  it  against Frank Taylor's Cafe at 3rd and  Main one day and went inside for a spot of  lunch. What happened next was recounted  in an article he wrote a few years before he  died.  ""A friend came in asked me if that was my  wheel out front. I said it was and he said  'It's a wreck now.' I said that was impossible  because I always pulled my wheel up on the  sidewalk and away from the gutter.  ""But I went outside and, sure enough, my  wheel was a crumpled mess. A woman driv ing a car and making a turn onto 3rd and  Main at outlandish speed lost control. She  jumped the curb and went 500 feet down  the sidewalk. My wheel was the only obsta cle in her path.''  Bicycle No.  4 was  the bicycle  around  which legends have grown. It was the bicy cle that ended up in the Snake River, and  may be rusting on the bottom yet. All my  life I have heard different versions of how  No. 4 ended up in the Snake River, includ ing testimony from eyewitnesses.  My father set the record straight in one of  his articles.  ""When Lewiston was legally dry, the town  of Asotin was wet. There was a constant mi gration from here to the Oasis in Washing ton state. At one  time a motor car was  pressed into service to take orders for deliv ery back to Lewiston. This came to a halt  when  Idaho  law  enforcement  officers  stepped in. It therefore became necessary to  make  the  trip  to Asotin yourself  if you  wanted a drink.  ""A wheel is a cumbersome thing to carry,  especially when one is seated in a phaeton  pulled by two high-stepping horses and in  the company of agreeable companions. On  this trip, No. 4 was resting on the top of the  step and started to become a nuisance when  we were about half way across the bridge.  The only remedy was to toss the wheel over  the rail and make the rest of the trip un hampered. This was  done. Again  I was  afoot.""  Wheel No. 5, a Columbia which cost $20,  lasted until the end of the line.  It was either upon No. 4 or No. 5 that my  father courted my mother, a demure secre tary in the John P. Vollmer Grain Co. who  lived on the far reaches of 14th Avenue. She  sat there waiting for Mr. Right. It turned  out  to be my father, pedaling along  the  footpaths of Normal Hill, carrying bouquets  and candy in his wire basket.  My mother had another suitor of sorts.  He brought neither candy nor flowers and  he didn't have a bicycle. He just sat in the  parlor. He  could not compete with  the  wheel  rider  sailing  across Normal Hill,  swooping up to the front door, the gallant  elegantly bestowing gifts.  Sometimes, I have been told, she would  play  the piano and they would sing the  latest ragtime tunes. And other times, she  would get on the handlebars and they would  go riding across the empty spaces of Normal  Hill.  A few years ago, a woman who was a little  neighbor girl during the courtship days told  me she saw an unusual occurrence while  spying  upon  the  romantic  couple  from  behind a bush.  Instead of going to the front door, he rode  up to an open window and whistled. Miss  Lora, as this little girl called her, decorously  climbed through the window and onto the  handlebars. Laughing wildly,  they  rode  ",1985

It is indeed regret table that Lithuanians must live under  these oppressed conditions.  I call upon my colleagues  in Con gress  today,  to make this  important  commitment on behalf of Lithuania a  year-round effort. We must remember  that  those who  suffer without  the  freedoms we so easily take for granted  look to us for guidance in the interna tional human rights struggle.  Our foreign policy must always re flect this commitment. As representa tives in the free world, it is imperative  we commit ourselves to the release of  the oppressed from the imposition of  Soviet  rule where  all  fundamental  freedoms have been repressed.  I wish to thank my able colleague,  FRANK ANNUNZIO, Congressman from  Illinois and the Lithuanian American  Council  for calling my attention  to  this important special order.e  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ANNIVERSARY OF LITHUANIAN  INDEPENDENCE  HON.

39,,99,-0.345,197,3,Mr. HERTEL of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, 67 years ago, on February 16,  1918, the people of Lithuania rejoiced  in the democratization and independ ence of Lithuania. For a  regrettably  short period, Lithuanians enjoyed a  more liberal society-one in which cen sorship, religious persecution, and po litical oppression were replaced by the  freedoms of  speech,  religious  affili ation, and assembly. Czarist absolut ism and agrarian practices gave way to  human dignity and modernization as  political, social, and economic reforms  were instituted. For the first time in  centuries, Lithuanian culture was free  to flourish.  This democratic renaissance was cut  short by  the  illegal Soviet  invasion  and occupation in 1940 of Lithuania  and her sister countries, Latvia and  Estonia. To this day, opposition to the  forced annexation results in imprison ment,  deportations,  and  executions.  Yet,  those who seek  to make  their  homeland more humane, democratic,  and autonomous have not given up  hope. Such  torture  and  denial  of  human rights has kindled, rather than  abated the desire of Lithuanians for  self-determination.  The United States has never recog nized the Soviet incorporation of the  Baltic States. Today, and until Lithua nia is freed from the Soviet grip, we  must again denounce this breach of  international accords, as well as Soviet  violations of human rights. For those  who are imprisoned behind the Soviet  wall of domination and oppression, let  us in the free world reaffirm our soli darity with  their fight  for national  sovereignty.  For  those whose  an guished cries have been muffled by  censorship  and  persecution,  let  us  voice our convictions for the rights to  liberty and justice. We are all bound  by  the Soviet chains of oppression  when any of us continues to suffer at  the hands of the Soviets. Only when  we have alleviated all suffering will  humanitarian and democratic  ideals  become reality for all humanity.e  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS DAY  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 1985  e ",1985
40,,99,-0.376,197,3,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, with my  distinguished  colleague  from Michi gan,  [Mr. VANDER  JAGT] and with 77  other Members of this House, I intro duced today a House joint resolution,  3071  designating August 4, 1985, as Press  Freedom Day in the United States.  August 4, 1985, marks the 250th an niversary of the landmark decision in  the case of John Peter Zenger of colo nial New York. The publisher of a  weekly  journal, Zenger was charged  with  libel by  the Governor of New  York for articles exposing corruption  in the colonial government. In a stir ring courtroom defense of Zenger, at torney Andrew Hamilton argued for  the right of any newspaper to print  the truth for the common good of the  people.  The  decision  exonerating  Zenger served as a watershed event in  establishing the principle of freedom  of the press in this land.  The commitment  to public media  working  free of government censor ship was clearly evident in the draft ing of our Nation's Bill of Rights. The  influence  of  Thomas  Jefferson,  George Mason, and James Madison en couraged members of  the Constitu tional Convention to view press free dom as ""one of the great bulwarks of  liberty."" By embodying freedom of the  press in the first amendment to the  Constitution, our Nation demonstrat ed unprecedented trust in the ability  of a well-informed public  to be full  participants in their own Government.  Our Nation's support for freedom of  the  press  represents  faith  in  the  people. Through more than 200 years  of  journalistic history, our Nation's  courts  have  def ended  the  public's  ""right to know,"" and the impropriety  of Government censorship  in which  national security  issues were not at  stake. In the landmark case of New  York Times Co. versus United States,  Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black  stressed the inviolability of the first  amendment guarantees:  ""The Founding Fathers gave  the  free  press the protection it must have to fulfill  its essential  role  in our democracy. The  press was to serve the governed, not the gov ernors.""  And so  it has. And  through such  service our Nation is arguably the best  informed society in history.  There have been  times when  the  commitment to freedom of the press  was not easy to maintain. There have  been attempts to control the media,  limit its inquisitive nature, or discour age its publication efforts. But despite  the episodic setbacks, press freedom  remains as vital  today as when the  first amendment was ratified in 1791.  That vitality serves as an inspiration  for millions  of men  and women  throughout  the world whose under standing of events  is  limited by the  State controlled media in their home lands.  As a fundamental liberty designed to  ensure participation by an  informed  people in their government, it is im portant for this Nation not only to ex press  its appreciation of press  free",1985
41,,99,-0.384,223,3,Mr. DOWNEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to  an outstanding profession  that has  made a truly concrete contribution to  this Nation-professional engineers.  As you know, this week is National  Engineers Week and this year's theme  is ""Turning Ideas into Reality."" In my  home county of Suffolk, the prof es sional engineers have turned so many  ideas  into reality that it is hard to  imagine that 25 years ago, much of  Suffolk County was  still  farmland.  Suffolk's  engineers  came  up with  plans to tackle the roadblocks to the  phenomenal growth Suffolk has expe rienced over the last quarter century.  But the roads, highways, sewers, and  electrified  railroads  are  only  one  aspect of the contribution engineers  have made to Long Island. With two  major defense corporations located in  Suffolk County, the ideas of Suffolk's  engineers have literally taken off from  the drawing board and into the sky.  Long  Island engineers designed  the  lunar module that carried our astro nauts to the Moon and the A-10, the  most capable close support plane ever  built and the F-14, the most sophisti cated  interceptor  in the world. And  these engineers remain on the cutting  edge of design  technology. Recently,  the Grumman Corp. test flew the X29, a new design that can revolutionize  fighter aircraft.  These projects and  the countless  others designed by Suffolk's engineers  have helped turn Suffolk into one of  the strongest economic areas  in the  country and I salute them for that.e  AN  ALTERNATIVE  SCHOOL-AN  ANSWER TO JUVENILE CRIME,  DRUGS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT  HON. MICKEY EDWARDS  OF OKLAHOMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 21, 1985  e ",1985
42,,99,0.394,223,3,Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, in response to the continuing  rise  in  the number of high school  3097  dropouts,  believed  to be  a  definite  factor in increased street crime, burg larly,  drug-related  crimes and drug  abuse,  in March  1977  a  group  of  Bartlesville, OK, community  leaders  decided to promote the establishment  of an alternative high school. Their ef forts  resulted  in  the  January 1977  opening of the Bartlesville Alternative  High School.  The purpose of the school is to reha bilitate  failure-oriented  secondary  school dropouts, potential dropouts,  truants, students on long-term suspen sion, those chronically involved in ju venile court action, pregnant minors,  and those having behavioral problems  severe enough to prohibit their par ticipation  in  the  established  high  school system. In order to fulfill  its  mission, the staff is carefully selected  both as to skill in teaching and skill  and experience in dealing constructive ly with the problems of these failure oriented  students. Each  student  is  given  a  demanding,  individualized  course of  instruction with emphasis  placed on basic education courses, for  example, math, English, science, and  social studies. Students are monitored  closely in small classes, many of which  must be geared to more than one level  of reading ability because of past fail ure records of students. The staff is  available continuously for counseling  and  outside  professional  counselors  are brought in for once-a-week group  counseling sessions. All counseling is  coordinated closely with the Bartles ville School Systems' Psychological  Services. Rigid discipline and attend ance standards are maintained at the  school. When needed, teacher-student  contracts, which exactly define teach er expectations and student responsi bilities with stated penalty for noncon formance, is used. A gratifying amount  of espirit de corp and motivation  is  achieved  in the resulting specialized  environment.  Bartlesville Alternative High School  has a remarkably high rate of success.  These  once  labeled  failure-oriented  students receive their high school di plomas,  pass  graduate  equivalency  exams and many are mainstreamed  into the regular schools. After gradua tion some seek higher education op portunities. Programs similar to this  one turn potential welfare or correc tions enrollees  into productive,  law abiding citizens and are worth an im mense amount to our society. Despite  their record, they suffer from funding  problems. Program cost are reasonable  at an average of $1,187 per student  when  compared  to  the  $15,000  to  $34,000 per year of an incarcerated ju venile. In Bartlesville, the community  has scraped to keep this much-needed  school through private donations and  special  allotments  from  the United  Fund.

43,Senate,99,-0.387,236,3,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President,  I  am deeply concerned over the Soviet  Union's dismal policy on emigration of  Jews and other minorities.  In 1984,  only 896 Jews were permitted to leave  the Soviet Union-a drastic decline  from  the 51,320 exit visas that were  granted Soviet Jews in 1979. Only 61  Jews were allowed to emigrate in Jan uary 1985. And Jews have been subject  to heightened persecution along with  other  religious minorities  in  recent  months.  With the United States-Soviet rela tionship especially volatile over  the  past two decades, it is clear that the  level of Jewish emigration has served  as hostage to the state of the bilateral  relationship.When detente was at its  height, the Soviets permitted Jewish  emigration to rise. But when our rela tions with the Kremlin are strained,  the  Soviets  drastically  reduce  the  number of exit visas.  As a signatory of the Helsinki Final  Act, the Soviet Union has pledged to  respect human rights,  including  the  right of citizens to emigrate freely and  to pursue family reunification. Yet the  Kremlin continues to hold Soviet Jews  hostage in a game of international pol itics and continues to harass Jews who  desire to emigrate. In recent months,  the Soviet Government has stepped up  its crackdown on Hebrew teachers and  other  Jewish  cultural  activists.  Hebrew  teachers are being arrested,  sentenced,  and  imprisoned  on  trumped-up  charges  designed  to  punish them for teaching and practic ing  their  religion.  All  Americans  should condemn  this shameful cam paign.  The Kremlin has little to gain by  continuing  to  block  the  legitimate  right of  the  Jewish  community  to  practice its faith and to emigrate. In  fact, Moscow has much to gain by al lowing its Jewish citizens and others  to emigrate. An increase in the grant ing of exit visas for Soviet Jews and  others would help to lessen tensions  between our two nations. I urge the  Soviet Union  to approve emigration  applications expeditiously and to make  a symbolic gesture by releasing Anato ly Shcharansky and allowing him to  emigrate, and granting Ida Nude! her  wish to be reunited with her sister in  Israel. Such positive gestures of good  will would be most welcome and most  constructive.  As an honorary Cochairman of the  newly established Congressional Coali tion for Soviet Jews, I will continue to  work hard with my colleagues to do all  I can to alleviate the plight of Soviet  Jews and other minorities seeking to  emigrate. I will also do my utmost in  pressing the Soviet leaders to liberal ize their emigration policy, to respect  the right of all their citizens to prac tice their religion free from pers~cu­ tion, and  to  live up  to  the human  rights guarantees of the Helsinki ac cords.  Mr. President, I am submitting for  the RECORD a table showing the disap pointing numbers of Soviet Jews being  granted exit visas by the Soviet Gov ernment.

THE  CIVIL  RIGHTS  RESTORA TION ACT: A CLARIFICATION  ",1985
44,Senate,99,0.135,236,3,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, a  few days ago, on February 19, 1985,  Senator  HATCH  spoke  before  the  Senate on the subject of civil rights.  My colleague from Utah said the fol lowing:  Last week a number of Congressmen in troduced something  they are calling  the  Civil Rights Recovery Act of 1985, which is  essentially, a  rehash of last year's Grove  City bill. Some people called last year's bill  the Big Brother Act of 1984.  I  expect  that Senator Packwood  and  others will this week introduce a counter part to the House bill.  I was surprised and a bit confused by  the statement by  the Senator from  Utah. I have acted on this issue more  than 2 weeks ago when, on February 7,  I  joined Senators KENNEDY, WEICKER,  and 43 others as a cosponsor of S. 431,  the Civil Rights Restoration Act of  1985. This bill is not a rehash of last  year's bill but a very thoughtful piece  of legislation that takes into account  the hours and hours of debate that oc",1985

48,Senate,99,0.631,288,3,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, at the  request of Secretary of Agriculture  John R. Block I am introducing the  administration's farm bill.  As I have indicated on numerous oc casions, I am convinced that this is a  watershed year for agriculture. All of  us are aware of the problems of Ameri ca's farmers and ranchers. And all of  us want to remedy the serious prob lems in the farm economy. The ques tion is: How to do it?  We cannot and will not ignore these  short-term problems, but neither can  we  ignore the fundamental problems  that simply must be corrected if we  are ever to put U.S. agriculture on the  path of prosperity.  Mr. President,  the point  is  this:  Many of today's problems in the agri cultural economy are the result of the  present farm programs. I believe it is  clear to most citizens that our present  farm programs are just not working.  This  is  revealed  by  the  fact  that  during  the past 4  years net  farm  income declined 27 percent compared  to the previous 4 years while direct  Federal payments to farmers increased  by more than 300 percent.  That is why we must face up to re ality. That is why we must use the op portunity  afforded by  the  expiring  farm legislation to reform general ag ricultural policy to make it market ori ented,  flexible,  internally consistent,  long-term in design, and sensitive to  all elements of the production system.  The general thrust of the adminis tration's bill is to move in that direc tion. Because of that, the administra tion bill will receive the careful consid eration of all who are interested in the  long-term health of our agricultural  economy.  While saying  that,  I also want  to  point out that I will shortly be intro ducing my own farm bill which differs  in some respects from the administra tion's bill. The Committee on Agricul ture, Nutrition, and Forestry will be  holding hearings on  these proposals  and other farm bills in March.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the administra tion's bill be printed in the RECORD at  the conclusion of my remarks along  with, a summary of the bill, a section by-section analysis, a title-by-title cost  estimate, questions and answers, and  issue papers prepared by the adminis tration to accompany its Agricultural  Adjustment Act of 1985.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be  printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.501  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That it is  hereby declared to be the policy of the Con gress, recognizing the fundamental  impor tance of agriculture to the United States  and the world and the unparalleled produc tive capacity of the American agricultural  industry, to assure a continuous, adequate,  and wholesome supply of food and fiber and  the long-term stability for American agricul ture. This Act may be cited as the ""Agricul tural Adjustment Act of 1985"".  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TITLE I-AGRICULTURAL TRADE AND  EXPORT EXPANSION  Sec. 101. Statements of policy.  Sec. 102.

49,Senate,99,0.342,327,3,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President.  I  am  happy  to  introduce  legislation  today which would designate the week  of May 1, 1985 through May 7, 1985 as  ""National  Osteoporosis  Awareness  Week"".  My goal in introducing this joint res olution is to promote and support the  education of the American population  on the preventive measures available  to fight this debilitating disease.  Osteoporosis is a condition in which  bone mass decreases causing bones to  be more susceptible  to fracture. Be tween 2 and 5 million Americans seek  medical help each year for some prob lem linked to osteoporosis. It afflicts  approximately 15 million Americans  overall, beginning as early as age 35,  and  is particularly a  threat to thin boned,  light-skinned women, women  who undergo an early menopause and  women whose female relatives have os teoporosis. In fact, 88 percent of osteo porosis victims are women. But this is  not to say that it is a disease that af flicts only women. As the aging proc ess progresses the risk of developing  osteoporosis  increases and,  for  that  reason, our older Americans, male and  female, must become aware of this dis ease.  Every year about 1.3 million persons  45 years and older suffer from frac tures  attributable  to  osteoporosis.  Fractures of the spine, hip and wrist  are most  common.  The  dowager's  hump is the result of a spine fracture.  It is estimated that 150,000 hip frac tures occur each year as a consequence  of osteoporosis and about 12 percent  of these people will die of related com plications.  I  know  from visits with  older Iowans that these fractures are  debilitating and, for many,  incapaci tating, resulting in a loss of independ ence and freedom.  When  I  look at  statistics  stating  that: 19.6 percent of our population  consists of women over 40; 11.6 per cent of our population is 65 years and  older; 13.1 percent of our population  will be over 65 by the year 2000.  That figure will increase to 21.7 per cent by 2050, and a  statistic that I  have a personal interest in: 13.3 per",1985
50,Senate,99,-0.435,340,3,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  February 24 will mark the 67th anni versary of the Estonian Declaration of  Independence, and  it  is  therefore a  most appropriate time to pay tribute  to the courage and spirit of the Esto nian people. The declaration is both a  reminder of the rich heritage of the  Estonian people and an expression of  their abiding faith in the future. For  while their personal and national in tegrity is cruelly oppressed it has not  been extinguished.  Although nations  and  empires of  Europe have fought over the Estonian  soil  through  the  centuries,  foreign  domination has never destroyed  the  identity, pride or dignity of the people  of Estonia. When the Estonian Repub lic was established after World War I,  its citizens  expressed  their commit ment to a free and democratic society  in a remarkable constitution, a docu ment modeled after the French, Swiss,  and United States Constitutions, and a  beacon of human rights and democrat ic government. During the brief period  between World War I and II, Esto nians prospered; they attained excep tionally high educational  standards,  and growth in the major spheres of ag riculture and industry became a model  for  other  democratic  nations. The  100,000  Estonian-Americans  with  whom we join in their day of celebra tion contribute greatly to the econom ic,  cultural,  political,  and  academic  growth  of  their  adopted American  communities. To every activity,  they  bring a deep respect for the traditions  of freedom and democracy, traditions  they had brought  from  their own  country.  Estonian Independence Day symbol izes  the determination and spirit of  the Estonian people. It provides an op portunity  for Americans  to  reflect  upon  the  proud  heritage  of  their  fellow citizens of Estonian descent and  their dedication  to the principles of  freedom and liberty for which this day  stands. This day is also an occasion to  remember courageous Estonians  like  Mart Niklus, who continue, against all  odds, to speak out in support of the  basic human rights defined in the Hel sinki Final Act.  Not more than 6 months ago, Mart  Niklus celebrated his 50th birthday as  a prisoner of conscience in the notori ous Soviet Chistopol prison, where An atoly Shcharansky is also incarcerat ed. Apart from a period during 196675, Mart Niklus has spent virtually all  of his adult life  in prison. A coura geous spokesman for his Estonian her itage, he has been condemned repeat edly  for  anti-Soviet  activities. Even  while  imprisoned, he has  remained  outspoken  in  his  protests  against  Soviet violations of human and nation al rights.  Brave Estonians, like Mart Niklus, in  the face of KGB interrogations, inter nal  exile  and  long  terms  in  labor  prison camps, continue to petition for  a nuclear freeze zone in Estonia. Let  us take this, the occasion of the 67th  anniversary of the Estonian Declara tion of Independence, and remember  these courageous men and women, and  hope, as they hope, that the day is not  far off when they may once again live  as a free and independent society   WEEKLY COLUMNS OF SENATOR  SIMON  e ",1985
51,Senate,99,-0.397,340,3,Mr. SIMON.," Mr. President,  each  week I write a column for the news  media of Illinois. When I say I write  the column,  that  is  literally  true-I  write it myself. It is not a staff pro duced column. I'm taking the liberty  of inserting  in  the RECORD  the first  few columns I've written this year. I  will enter them in the RECORD each  week so that my colleagues and their  staffs will know my thinking on a vari ety of  issues and so  they can help  refine my thinking. I need that.  The material follows:  DEBT-FREE ANNIVERSARY REMINDS Us THAT  DIFFICULT GOALS ARE ATTAINABLE  An anniversary slipped by the other day  which  should have  been more  formally  noted: On January 8, 1835 the United States  government made the final payment on the  national debt. The nation was debt-free.  Andrew Jackson was President. Secretary  of the Navy, Mahlon Dickerson, predicted  inaccurately that the date would go down in  American history as a holiday second only  to July 4th.  Senator Thomas Hart Benton in flowery  language said this was a phenomenon ""so  long unseen on earth, a great nation with out a national debt . . . to the astonished  vision of a wondering world.""  The newspapers reported there was ""great  cheering.""  How distant  that January day of 1835  seems-and not simply because of the pas sage of time.  With a national debt which now stands at  $1.6 trillion, we are not likely to see the re tirement of the U.S. debt in my lifetime, nor  in  the  lifetime of anyone  reading  these  words.  Now we are struggling to avoid increasing  it too much in the next fiscal year, a pale  goal  compared  to  the  goal  reached  in  Andrew Jackson's day.  While the latter goal is less dramatic, it  should be the solid resolve of Democrats  and Republicans in the House and Senate  and in the administration to stop this head long rush into fiscal chaos.  Contrary  to what some political  leaders  may suggest to you, stopping this showball ing debt is not going to be easy.  But the question is not whether it can be  done; obviously it can. The real question is  one of will, one of courage.  Will  the Democrats and Republicans  in  Congress have enough  courage  to move  within the next four years to a balanced  budget? Will the administration, no longer  faced with reelection problems, face the real  problem?  We are now  living on a gigantic credit  card, spending more than we take in, and we  are  telling  those  from whom we borrow:  send the bill to our children and our grand children.  This fiscal year the national debt will be  approximately $210 billion.  In fiscal year  1962, when John F. Kennedy was president,  many people were concerned about a total  federal budget  that that year crept past  $100 billion. Now the federal budget is over  $900 billion and the interest alone on the  debt this past fiscal year was $132 billion.  January 8, 1835.  That date should remind us that difficult  things are attainable.  We should honor those who achieved that  goal of eliminating  the national debt by  acheiving  a more modest  goal; moving  toward balancing the budget.  And  then I hope we can seriously  talk  about gradually reducing the federal indebt edness.  ",1985

There would be no  amend ments  that are not relevant  to  the  farm issue, with the added provision  that will  allow amendments  in  the  first and second degree anent appro priations. No point of order would lie  against that particular type of amend ment.  Mr. President,  the colloquy would  then ensue between Mr. BYRD, Mr.  DOLE, and Mr. COCHRAN, and I would  hope we would allow any other Sena tor to also participate in that colloquy  because everyone has to be satisfied  with respect to the timing of the Afri can  relief  appropriations  bill, H.R.  1239.  Moreover, Mr. DOLE and I have en tered  into a gentleman's agreement  which would provide  that when the  Senate turns to the consideration of S.  457, the African relief bill, that busi ness will  stay before  the Senate unless  the  two  leaders agree other wise-until that bill is finally disposed  of, however long that takes.  Now, the words ""disposed of"" could  involve an up or down vote, could in volve passage of the measure, could in volve rejection of the measure, could  involve tabling the measure, could in volve  indefinitely  postponing  the  measure. These are ways of ""dispos ing"" of  the matter. As  I often said  with respect to Mr. Baker, if I had his  word, I could walk off the floor and  know that that word would be kept. I  had no  concern about Mr. Baker's  promises when he assured me that I  did not have  to stay on  the  floor.  ""This is all that will be done,"" he said,  and I never found that faith broken.

This would be a markup  session in the full committee on Ap propriations on Tuesday, March 5.  The chairman of the full committee,  Senator  who  has  just  stepped off the floor, has indicated to  me that it is his intention to deal with  that matter as expeditiously as PoSSi ble and to request that the matter be  taken up on the floor of the Senate as  soon as it can be scheduled following  the work of the Committee on Appro priations.

63,Senate,99,-0.142,444,3,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I would  like today to express my support for  the passage of a clean interstate cost  estimate bill. Currently $39.3 million  in  interstate construction funds and  $58. 7 million  in minimum allocation  funds are being withheld from Okla homa's construction program due  to  the delay in approving the ICE.  Each month of delay  erodes  the  buying  power  of  the  construction  dollar and adds to the cost of complet ing critical interstate and other high way projects which could be financed  with minimum allocation funds. Re lease of our State's apportionment of  these Federal funds will allow Oklaho ma to initiate over $100 million in new  construction projects which will  in  turn  create  jobs  beneficial  to my  State's faltering economy.  Mr.  President, Oklahoma  is  not  alone in her desire to see quick pas sage of a clean ICE bill. There are no  fewer than 12 States that are suffer ing from the withholding of interstate  construction funds as well as the lack  of a timely release of over $1 billion in  minimum allocation funds which are  dependent upon the approval of the  ICE bill.  Mr. President, I would urge my col leagues to consider the merits of this  legislation and vote for its final pas sage.  ",1985
64,Senate,99,0.261,444,3,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President,  it is  well past time we ratified an interstate  cost estimate CICEl and interstate sub stitute cost estimate CISCEl bill.  I have long favored a bill like S. 391  that frees up funds for approved high way construction without costly pork  barrel projects. The bill approves the  ICE for the second half of fiscal year  1985 and for all of fiscal year 1986.  Interstate construction all across our  Nation has come to a virtual standstill  because of inaction, shortsightedness,  and irresponsibility. The State of Wis consin,  like many other States, has  been held hostage to those in Congress  who are only interested in promoting  themselves and their last minute, spe cial projects. In the process, they have  managed to ignore the well-being and  health of our Nation's interstate high ways.  How long must the people of Wis consin wait for highway  funds  that  they  have  contributed  toward  and  which are rightly theirs? The f allure  of Congress to act decisively on inter state funding has resulted in the loss  of $96 million (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  figures used by Senator DoLE on Feb ruary 20,  1985)  to Wisconsin alone,  and has jeopardized close to 60 crucial  highway projects now designated  in  my State for const!""uction and repairs.  Without these funds, it is impossible  for Wisconsin to begin to plan for its  spring and summer construction peri ods. Spring may arrive late in Wausau,  but this kind of delay  is  ridiculous.  Let's not forget the full consequences  of our delay on this issue. Not only  will  the traveling public suffer from  unbuilt and unrepaired  roads;  thou sands  of  construction workers will  remain  unemployed  after  an  idle  winter. Tens of thousands of smaller  businesses and suppliers who provide  construction materials will suffer un necessarily. In Wisconsin alone, almost  5,000 jobs are at stake.  Parliamentary gimmicks and quick sand amendments have made quick  action on this legislation  impossible.  Last year, costly transit projects and  tunnels attached in the House delayed  final passage of a similar bill. At that  time, I called on House conferees to  put aside parochial  interests so we  could get essential highway projects  moving  again. Unfortunately,  they  failed to do so.  I urge the Senate to act responsibly  by acting immediately. Time is at a  premium. There is no more time for  deliberations  in  the  huddle.  The  House, too, must play ball or face the  consequences of forfeiture.  I want to thank Senator DOLE for his  strong leadership in bringing this bill  up for a vote on the floor, and Sena tors STAFFORD, SYMMS, and BENTSEN on  the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee for their fine work.  I ask the majority leadership in the  House to show the same strength and  resolve by doing what is clearly right  for the American people.  Mr. President, as an original cospon sor of this bill, I am ready to vote im mediately, because  I know  that for  every additional hour that is wasted  here in Washington, another day will  slip by before  roads and bridges  in  Wisconsin are repaired and the safety  of travelers in Wisconsin and through out the country is ensured.  Thank you.  ",1985
65,Senate,99,-0.262,444,3,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today  in support of  the  Interstate  Highway Funding Act of 1985. I am  pleased to do so because this bill ap proves  the release of the  interstate  cost estimate CICEl and the interstate  substitute cost estimate CISCEl which  have  been  unnecessarily  delayed.  Many of  the State of Ohio's badly  needed highway projects have been  postponed  until  Congress  releases  these essential funds.  In the past, approval of the ICE has  been a fairly routine matter. During  the past 2 years, however, Congress  has had difficulty reaching an agree ment on an ICE and ISCE approval.  This difficulty arose, Mr. President,  because of disputes over funding for mulas and parochial projects connect ed with ICE legislation. These disputes  have accomplished little and have cost  a great deal. My own State of Ohio  has had nearly $250 million dollars  held hostage because representatives  from other States have been unable to  resist  the  temptation  to attach pet  projects to this legislation.  The result of such congressional bot tlenecks is that our transportation in frastructure,  the  foundation  upon  which our economy is built, continues  to crumble. Our roads are breaking up  and our bridges  are  falling  down.  These problems will only grow worse  through neglect and, as  these prob lems grow, our economic productivity  will continue to decline. We can begin  to make progress in these as soon as  we pass a clean ICE.  Today, the Senate will be taking an  appropriate first step in that direction.  The legislation we are considering con tains not only an 18-month ICE, it di rects the Secretary of Transportation  to release the interstate construction  and substitute funds administratively  if Congress has not approved an ICE  and ISCE by October 1. In light of the  problems we have encountered in the  past, I feel this is a reasonable solu tion and I urge its immediate support.  PASSAGE OF THE ICE IS URGENTLY NEEDED  ",1985
66,Senate,99,0.498,444,3,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President, our  Nation's highways are already pitted  by potholes. There are both controlla ble and uncontrollable causes for this  tragedy. As we all know, this has been  an unusually harsh winter, with pre dictable results for our Nation's high ways. Soon the thaws, freezing rains  and downpours of  late winter and  early spring will worsen that damage  to our streets and highways. As all of  us know, potholes are a serious traffic  safety hazard.  In densely populated  urban areas or out in rural townships,  a traveler's safety is jeopardized when  repairs are not made in a timely fash ion. We cannot control the weather,  but we can respond in a rational way  to its ravages.  A  few  years  ago,  the Congress  showed tremendous interest in our Na tion's  crumbling  infrastructure,  cluding  speedy  repair of highways,  bridges and completion of the Inter state System. For the past 18 months,  however, we have shown too little of  that concern. In fact, we have done  nothing to address  this pressing na tional problem.  There are construction workers  in  my State who desperately want  to  work. There are contractors who are  ready  to begin projects. There are  State highway officials who have long  lists of projects that need to be done.  State and local governments are ready  and able to cooperate with the Federal  Government. For once, the problem is  not that there is no money to make  these repairs or to begin new projects.  In fact, $7 .2 billion is in the highway  trust fund. The failure to repair our  Nation's streets  and  highways  can  only be blamed on the Congress of the  United States.  in ",1985

They also serve notice to this Con gress and the people of the United  States  that  the Reagan administra tion's foreign policy on South Africa that of constructive engagement-has  made no significant  inroads, has re ceived no substantive concessions, has  fostered no meaningful  changes  in  that country's dedication  to  racism,  and has, in fact, given both encourage ment and strength to those forces op posing any type of peaceful reform.  It is time for this administration to  make clear to South Africa that the  United States can no longer be a silent  partner to its practice of state support ed  terrorism,  systematically  visited  upon its 22 million black South Afri cans. We can do this most effectively  by indicating now that American dol lars will no longer be available to a  country that practices such inhuman ity to man. In short, now's the time to  halt  any  further American  invest ments in South Africa; and now is the  time to push for a timely withdrawal  of all U.S. firms doing business there.  THE SO-CALLED AMERICAN  MIRACLE  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his  remarks and  include extraneous  matter.>  ",1985
68,House,99,-0.41,470,3,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, all  of us in this House welcome economic  growth and prosperity. However, Mr.  Reagan's description of his policies as  ""An American Miracle"" has to make  even the most rock rib Republican, a  little squeemish.  Let there be no misunderstanding Mr.  Reagan  and  his  Republican  friends  are  financing  this  so-called  miracle by borrowing $200 billion a  year. In 4 short years, Mr. Reagan and  his Republican friends have managed  to double the national debt. By 1988,  they want to triple it. The only mirac ulous  thing about  this borrow-and spend policy is that Mr. Reagan is still  getting away with it.  Mr. Speaker, an editorial in today's  Washington  Post  refers  to  these  borrow-and-spend policies as ""The Ro mantic School of Economic Thought.""  Mr.  Reagan  and  his  Republican  friends would be well-advised to read  this warning and be  advised: That  which is for us today an ""Economic  Miracle,"" bears for our children the  seeds of an ""Economic Nightmare.""  THE ""AMERICAN MIRACLE""  Americans' incomes and economic output  rose  strongly  in 1984. The government's  scorekeepers have  just  revised  the GNP  numbers upward once again, and President  Reagan celebrated them in the preamble to  his  press  conference Thursday  evening.  That will set off another round in the inter esting debate over the reasons for this pow erful and gratifying performance.  Mr. Reagan has no doubts. He attributes  the ""American miracle"" to tax cuts, incen tives and the unleashed spirit of free enter prise. Now the country is embarked, in his  view, on the sustained growth that he prom ised four years ago.  That's the Romantic School of economic  thought-optimistic, ebullient and attrac tive. But perhaps you ought to ask for a  second opinion. There's another explana tion that's a little less uplifting but tighter  in its logic.  Federal budget deficits speed up economic  growth, at least for a while. That's basic  Keynesian economics. Governments discov ered in the late 1930s that it works, and  have been using it ever since-none more  vigorously and unapologetically  than Mr.  Reagan's. He points out that the country's  growth rate last year was the highest since  1951. Quite true. But for 21h years the coun try has been running the largest federal de ficts since 1946.  The curious thing about the Reagan ad ministration's strategy is the fidelity with  which it seems to be following the model of  the 1960s,  the Kennedy-Johnson years. It  was a time not only of extraordinarily high  economic growth, at least through 1966, but  of unbroken growth. There was no recession  from 1961 to 1969, by far the longest cycle  of growth  in the past generation. In Mr.  Reagan's first term, he gave great emphasis  to the 1964 tax cut as the precedent for his  own cuts. But by 1966 the strongest influ ence on the economy, prolonging the expan sion, was the military buildup for the Viet nam War. The present rise in defense spend ing may similarly extend Mr. Reagan's ex pansion.  Defense spending in the mid-1980s is not  nearly as high, as either a share of the  budget or of the country's total output, as it  was in the late 1960s. The Reagan proposals  would not raise it to that level even by the  end of the decade.  But while President Reagan's defense  spending is lower than President Johnson's  was,  his deficits  are much bigger. This  year's deficit, the administration says, will  be 5.7 percent of GNP. Mr. Johnson's larg est deficit was 3 percent of GNP, at the  height of the war in 1968. That was  the  year, incidentally, when inflation got out of  control, to the great cost of Mr. Johnson's  successors.  Mr. Reagan claims to have put the Ameri can economy on an altogether new and  higher track. But so far it appears to be fol lowing a familiar historical pattern.

70,Senate,99,-0.332,522,3,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, ""Let's Talk  With Castro"" is the title of an excel lent and prescient Op-Ed piece written  by Representative BILL ALExANDER in  a recent issue of the New York Times  and also is a sentiment which I have  expressed myself over the past years,  especially since my  trip  to Cuba  in  1974 with Senator Javits. As a result  of two recent trips to Cuba, the last  one in January when he and Repre sentative JIM LEAcH spent a  total of  over 38 hours with the Cuban Presi dent, Congressman ALEXANDER believes  that  the  administration  should  re spond positively to Cuba's conciliatory  overtures to the United States.  My colleagues know that I have been  a strong advocate of normalizing rela tions with Cuba, because I believe that  could improve the prospects of reduc ing Cuba's intervention  in  the area.  One immediate result of normalization  would  likely  be  the  reduction  in  Cuba's spewing of harsh invective and  hatred  in  the  region  against  the  United States. It is no wonder that  Cuba feels so bitter toward the United  States since this Nation has attempted  to assassinate its leaders, has launched  one large invasion of that nation and  who knows how many minor ones, and  has done its best to isolate Cuba from  its neighbors  in  the Western Hemi sphere.  The agreement on immigration, con cluded in December and now being im plemented,  is a  stark demonstration  that the United States and Cuba can  deal with each other on matters of  mutual concern and  interest. Let us  build on the momentum begun by the  agreement and see if Fidel Castro is  serious about his expressed willingness  to talk about other issues of mutual  concern, which could hold out  the  prospect  for  a  peace  settlement  in  Central America and a  reduction of  tensions  in  southern Africa.  This  theme also is stressed in the Alexan der article which I highly recommend  to my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that this excellent  article by Representative BILL ALEX ANDER from the February 14 edition of  the New York Times be printed in full  at this point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  LET's TALK WITH CASTRO  <By William V. Alexander, Jr.>  WASHINGTON.-President  Reagan  would  make a serious mistake if he rejected the  conciliatory offer tendered this month by  Fidel Castro.  The Cuban leader's message is clear: he  wants to lessen tensions between Cuba and  the United States. This, he hopes, will give  Cuba access to United States markets and  improve  the prospect  that entrepreneurs  will take advantage of Cuba's new law per mitting  foreign  investment.  In exchange,  President Castro seems willing to cooperate  in bringing about a political solution  to  problems in Central America and Africa.  My recent trips to Cuba,  in August and  January,  convince me  that Mr. Castro  means business. For all his Communist ide ology, he is a shrewd observer of interna tional economic trends and he looks with  some envy on the developing relationship  between the United States and the People's  Republic of China.  Economically,  things are not going well  for Cuba. At present, the Soviet Union is  subsidizing the Cuban economy at the rate  of some $4 billion to $4.5 billion annually.  Yet Moscow is apparently reluctant to in crease its aid, and Mr. Castro fears that the  help may eventually stop altogether. Even  with that help, which need not be repaid,  Cuba's foreign debt is said to range between  $10 billion and $12 billion-more than its es timated gross national product.  President Castro's proposed solution is a  20 percent increase in exports to Western  nations that pay in hard currency. Cuban  leaders are also particularly  interested in  joint ventures  that would yield manufac tured products for export.  For 25 years, Fidel Castro has pushed the  Cuban  economy  toward  industralization,  with  limited success. Agricultural exports  dominate, as they did before the revolution.  Food and consumer goods are rationed. Low  productivity  remains  a  problem  despite  measures to encourage decentralized man agement.  The country's economic problems are also  compounded by politics. The new genera tion-more than half the population-was  born after Mr. Castro came to power and is  particularly impatient for signs of economic  progress. The new law allowing Cubans to  own their own homes, and the appearance  of supermarkets stocked with scarce con sumer goods, were undoubtedly designed to  satisfy  this generation while spurring  in creased productivity among all workers. The  resumption of economic relations with the  United States would be the next logical step  in this direction.  We might begin to move toward a thaw by  opening talks on several immediate points  of tension. In particular, Mr. Castro is will ing to discuss aircraft hijacking, radio inter ference caused by overlapping broadcast fre quencies, mutual assistance  for distressed  ships and disputes over common  fishing  grounds. The United States has an interest  in making  progress  on  all  four  issues,  whether or not negotiations  led  to some thing bigger.  If, however,  the  talks did go well, we  should be encouraged to take up Mr. Cas tro's offer to work together to find a peace ful resolution to tensions in Central Amer ica and Africa.  For openers, Mr. Castro says he would  agree  in advance  to  the concept of third  party ""verificaiton"" of compliance with any  Central American treaty negotiated by the  Contadora  Group-Colombia,  Mexico,  Panama and Venezuela. This would indeed  be a significant step toward peace, for the  absence of a verificaiton provision was the  stated reason that the United States reject ed the first Contadora treaty proposal.  Surely it is in the United States' interest  to pursue  this offer. Both Cuba and the  Soviet Union consider  that  they have a  major stake in the future of Central Amer ica and the rest of the Western Hemisphere.  Until now, Washington has seen  this as  something necessary  threatening. It need  not be. Would it not after all be in our inter est to lessen tensions with the only country  in the hemisphere with a military facility at  the disposal of the Soviet Union? What's  more, if we can negotiate with the Russians,  surely we can talk with the Cubans. What  do we have to lose?  Lessening tensions between our two coun tries through cultural exchanges and, even tually,  trade,  could  also  strengthen  the  bonds created by our common cultural her itage.  In  the  long  run,  such  exchanges  might even be an opportunity  to export  American  political  ideals  to Cuba. Our  nation  has  200  years  of  experience  in  making the American Revolution work-and  we should be willing to share the wisdom of  this experience. Let us be big enough, as a  nation, to invite Mr. Castro and the Cuban  people to the conference table.  SENATOR QUAYLE'S CONTRIBU TION TO SENATE REFORM  ",1985

74,,99,-0.172,600,3,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, each  year  in our  review of  the military  budgets, we hear of high technology  programs associated with billions of  dollars,  complex  instrumentation,  computerized  to  the  umpteenth  degree, with associated  interface re quirements, and a  long R&D evolu tion. All of which makes Congress and  DOD sensitive to cost overruns. How ever, this past year a military program  reached fruition under cost, on sched ule, and without fanfare. I believe this  program could easily be described as  the single greatest enhancement  to  combat readiness in recent years-the  M16A2, combat rifle for our infantry men.  The M16A2 program is a  textbook  success story from the standpoint of  identifying the requirement and exe cuting a program at minimal cost. In  1979 the Marine Corps saw the need to  commence a program that would ulti mately lead to the production of a new  service  rifle,  replacing  the  aged  M16Al. The significance of this pro gram  lies  in  the fact  that the real  users of the weapon executed the pro gram. Although  the  program  fell  under the administrative parameters  of the Joint Services Small Arms Pro gram, the U.S. Marine Corps took the  lead with support from Army person nel during the operational tests and  evaluations. The close cooperation be tween the Marine Corps, Army, and  Colt Industries allowed the military to  design,  test, make changes, and test  again until the final product was ap proved  for service use by both  the  Army and the Marine Corps.  The importance of this program lies  in  the  fact  that  there  is only one  single weapon capable of seizing and  holding key terrain and that is the sol dier or marine armed with his rifle.  I would like to recognize with all our  service men and women those key indi viduals of  this highly important and  successful program: Lt. Col. Charles  Pyle, USMC; Lt. Col. David Lutz,  USMC; Maj. Michael Smith, USMC;  CWO Bruce Wincentsen, USMC; G.  Sgt. Edwin Martin, USMC; S. Sgt.  Philip Stover, USMC. Of course there  were many other dedicated soldiers,  marines, and loyal, hard working civil ians at Colt Industries that made this  program a success. These individuals  demonstrated selfless devotion to a Job  that was paramount to safeguarding  our Nation's defense by developing the  finest combat rifle for our soldiers and  marines.e  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 25, 1985  e ",1985
75,,99,0.227,600,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  this month we celebrated the 67th An niversary of the Declaration of Esto nian Independence. It is vitally impor tant that we pause and think about  the  significance  of  commemorating  this day. The loss of any country to to talitarianism is a tragic experience and  one which all free men should know  and never forget. Only by remember ing can we profit from the mistakes of  the past and promise never to repeat  them.  As all of you know, Estonia, Lithua nia, and Latvia were once free and in dependent nations. In 1922, the United  States recognized those republics and  welcomed them into the international  arena. The Baltic Republics were  viable nations made up of industrious  and  independent farmers who cher ished their freedom.  In 1940,  the Soviet Army marched  into the Baltic States, and effectively  sealed  those small nations off from  the prying eyes of Western media.  They immediately formed puppet re gimes. The  legislatures,  completely  dominated by members of the Commu nist Party, petitioned  the Supreme  Soviet of the U .S.S.R to incorporate  each Baltic Republic into the Soviet  Union.  As soon as the Soviet troops arrived,  and  the  incorporation was declared,  the  troops began a  systematic cam paign of violence against the popula tion of these nations. They needed to  totally eliminate any opposition to the  new order. Over 665,000 Estonians,  Lithuanians, and Latvians were de ported to Siberia. Thousands died in  Soviet  concentration  camps.  The  Kremlin  settled  large  numbers  of  people of Russian stock in Estonia and  in other Baltic States to strengthen  their control of the area. Widespread  bloodshed  ensued when  the Baltic  guerrillas took to the forest to estab lish a network of armed opposition to  the illegal occupiers. More people were  killed when  the  front changed and  Nazi Germany  invaded her old ally,  the Soviet Union.  When  the  Soviets  returned  the  second time in 1944, they were deter mined to stay and began a brutal plan  of  collectivizing  the  countryside.  Farmers were forcibly evicted and de ported. Thousands managed to flee to  the West that year. More troops than  ever were brought in to destroy the  guerrilla movement. Even so, the par tisans continued  their struggle until  the early 1950's when, islolated by nu merous divisions, many in the resist ance movement gave up their arms.  In spite of overwhelming oppression,  the peoples of the Baltic States are  still struggling to maintain their lin guistic, ethnic, and religious identities.  We cannot abandon  these  freedom loving peoples. The Estonians,  and  other ethnic groups along the eastern  coast of the Baltic Sea, have already  demonstrated their determination for  liberty and  their willingness  to do  what is necessary to keep their nation al characters intact.  We must continue  to  remind  the  world that there once were free and  independent Baltic States, and should   work together to bring about an end to  the illegal occupation of Estonia and  other states in the region.  On  this anniversary,  I am certain  that my colleagues  in  the Congress  will join me in saying that those who  forget history are doomed to repeat it.  MEMORANDUM  ""Never in the course of centuries have the  Estonian people lost their ardent desire for  independence. From generation to genera tion, Estonians have kept  alive  the ...  hope that in spite of enslavement and op pression by other nations,  the  time will  come in Estonia ... when Kalev will come  home to bring his children happiness.""  With such timeless conviction begins Esto nia's Declaration  of  Independence,  pro claiming Estonia a free democratic republic  on February 24, 1918. On that day, Kalevi poeg,  the hero of  the Estonian national  epic, did come home  to bring his people  freedom  and  happiness. An  unwavering  desire for self-determination and freedom  from foreign oppression gave the Estonian  people the strength to fight for independ ence simultaneously against two invaders Bolshevik Russia and the German Landes wehr. Estonian  soldiers  overcame  these  overwhelming obstacles and defeated both  enemies.  During the brief period of political inde pendence,  Estonians  enjoyed  cultural  progress, agricultural and economic develop ment. In 1925 the young republic, appreciat ing  the  importance  of  ethnic  identity,  became the first country in the world to  grant  its minorities-Russians, Jews, Ger mans  and  Latvians-cultural  autonomy  through  government  subsidized  ethnic  schools, theaters and libraries.  World War II, however, brought alternate  Soviet and Nazi invasions ending in the forc ible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet  Union, an illegal takeover not recognized by  the United States to this day. Brutal depor tations took over one tenth of the popula tion  into Russian slave labor camps, while  scores of others lost their lives fighting the  enemy. In defiance of enormous obstacles,  tens of thousands managed to flee to free dom in the West in 1944. Now scattered all  over the world, Estonians derive knowledge  of experience from the past: they are deter mined not to allow their heritage to fade  away.  However, this month, the 67th anniversa ry of the Republic of Estonia's Declaration  of Independence finds its people in the West  and in Soviet-occupied Estonia gravely con cerned about their future. In Estonia, a sys tematic Soviet policy of russification and  national genocide is being carried out.

76,,99,-0.516,613,3,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, it is with great pride that I com memorate the 67th anniversary of Es tonian Independence Day. The Esto nian people in the Soviet Union have  demonstrated  great  courage  and  strength as  they attempt  to  regain  their freedom as we in the free world  know it.  On February 24, 1985, we marked  the proclamation of independence for  the Republic of Estonia. The Esto nians enjoyed cultural progress, agri cultural  and  economic  development  until 1940, when their freedom and inEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dependence came to an end as they  were forcibly annexed by the Soviet  Union. On  a  day-to-day  basis  the  number of Estonians is being reduced  drastically by forced relocation, coloni zation by Russian and other  immi grants, and  increases  in  troops sta tioned in Estonia. The Estonians con tinue  to experience  threats  to  their  culture  and  language.  The  Soviet  Union has tried to rid them of their  strong sense of heritage by eliminating  their language and ethnic  traditions  and establishing Russian as the offi cial language in government employ ment and in schools. Such acts demon strate the Soviet attempt to ""Russian ize"" these people out of existence.  As a member of a  free nation, we  must continue  to speak out against  such aggression by the Soviet Union.  We must continue to seek the enforce ment of the Helsinki accords and im press upon the Soviet Union our objec tion to the denial of these individuals'  basic human rights.  Mr. Speaker, I am very moved by the  strength and conviction of these brave  people. I am thankful for this oppor tunity to pay tribute to these coura geous people of Estonia whose pro found courage and overwhelming com mitment to freedom and human rights  is an inspiration to us all.e  USIA: TAKING THE INITIATIVE  IN GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS  HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 25, 1985  e ",1985
77,,99,0.372,613,3,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, Director  Charles Z. Wick of the U.S. Informa tion Agency has written a letter to Mr.  Leonid M. Zamyatin, Chief, Interna tional Information Department, Cen tral Committee, Communist Party of  the Soviet Union,  inviting Zamyatin  and other Soviet officials to appear on  the USIA-sponsored World.net  Pro gram, beamed by satellite in order to  question  top-level American officials  around the world. At the same time,  American  journalists, under Director  Wick's proposal, would question Soviet  officials in a similiar manner.  At this point I insert in the RECORD  the full text of that letter because in  my view it is an example of what USIA  can do-take the initiative in the field  of global communications in order to  bring about better understanding be tween nations.  The letter follows:  U.S. INFORMATION AGENCY,  Washington, DC, January 25, 1985.  Mr. LEONID M. ZAMYATIN,  Chief,  International  In.formation Depart ment, Central Committee, Communist  Party of  the Soviet Union, Staraya  Ploshchad' 4, Moscow, U.S.S.R.  DEAR MR. ZAMYATIN:  In recent months  Soviet media have levied a number of at tacks on U.S. public diplomacy and the U.S.  3487  Information Agency, especially on the Voice  of America and our new Worldnet satellite  television service. Your article in Literatur naya Gazeta [""Impasses of Confrontations  and Horizons of Cooperation,"" November  28, 19841 summarizes most of the charges  and typifies the underlying mindset. I am  prompted to respond at this time to the con tinuing  stream of  attacks because  in  a  period when our two governments are en gaged in serious exploration of vital issues,  such attacks are a disservice to more posi tive relations.  My hope is to generate a constructive dia logue. To initiate that dialogue I extend two  concrete offers. First, I ask that you offer  your good offices to facilitate using broad cast media to further mutual understand ing. In this regard, I suggest that you ar range for Soviet television to carry an ad dress by one of our top leaders which would  be reciprocated on American television by  one of your top leaders. There is a prece dent for this: Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Nixon  made such speeches several years ago with  considerable positive effect.  Second, I propose that we carry further  the dialogue by having you and other Soviet  officials and  journalists  take part in  the  Worldnet program of which you are so criti cal. Let us jointly plan a oneto two-hour  satellite television dialogue on Worldnet in  which Soviet  journalists  interview senior  U.S. officials on issues of mutual concern.  At the same time, you should plan with U.S.  media a similar program in which American  journalists freely and spontaneously ques tion senior Soviet officials. Coming at this  important time in our relations, such ven tures could help make communication more  reasoned and reciprocal.  Incidentally, I am not surprised by your  unwarranted criticisms of Worldnet and of  our Agency. I have come to expect it. How ever, you should understand that our coun try does not claim, as you do, that opposing  ideas ""subvert"" our system. We recognize in stead that diversity of public opinion is one  of the great strengths of America. Thus, our  society freely permits Soviet spokesmen to  state their views on American television and  in print. In this regard, I might note that  Soviet  journalists and Soviet officials are  interviewed on American television literally  dozens of times per year. Surely the time  has come for greater equality of treatment.  If the United States can confidently toler ate opposing views without fears of ""loosen ing"" the system, why then should the Soviet  government act so restrictively, even to the  point of jamming our broadcasts in direct  violation  of  several  international  agree ments to which the USSR is a signatory?  Why not allow greater independent public  inquiry about your government's decisions  and policies? Why should American offi cials, in turn, not be permitted to state their  views on Soviet television and in the Soviet  media? Our society has never walked away  from a fair challenge, and we look forward  to engaging in a peaceful contest of ideas  with the USSR.  Your article is evidence of the need for  this reasoned and open dialogue. Charges of  ""piracy of the air."" ""radio warfare,"" ""sub versive purpose,"" and ""television propagan da aggression"" only exacerbate  the ""im passes"" and ""confrontations"" to which you  allude and delay our search for ""horizons of  cooperation."" Coming at this time, when the  leaders of our two countries are seeking new  means for considering meaningful arms re duction efforts and ways to stabilize rela tions, your attacks are most unfortunate.  Surely,  everyone  concerned  about U.S.",1985

80,House,99,-0.225,639,3,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, it  is wonderful that we are able to come  together today and continue the U.S.  commitment to helping the drought stricken countries of Africa. It is a  tribute to this Congress that we have  made this a priority early in the ses sion.  I hope we can continue  to make  Africa a priority because no matter  how much  food aid we  send  today,  without a commitment  to  long-term  strategies, Africans will still be starv ing next year. Without seed and well drilling equipment,  there will be no  grain and vegetables next year. During  the budget process, I urge each of you  to remember that seeds and tools sent  today mean fewer bags of grain that  we""ll need to send next year.  In July, the U.N. Decade for Women  World Conference will  take place in  Nairobi, Kenya. Its outcome may be  the key to any long-term solution to  drought and famine. It will provide a  forum  for women  in developing na tions to tell us what we can do to help  them solve their own problems. They  don't want or need us  to do  it for  them, but they do know that we can  off er valuable assistance and tools if  we will only hear what  they need.  Women perform nearly two-thirds of  the world's work hours. Let's listen to  them as we  consider  the  long-term  strategies we must consider to contin ue the commitment we are showing  here today.  By listening to women in developing  countries, we will be tapping new re sources in Africa, resources that will  enrich it.  ",1985
81,House,99,0.227,639,3,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York CMr. SOLOMON], a member  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  ",1985
82,House,99,0.492,639,3,Mr. SOLOMON.," Mr. Speaker, at this  point in the debate, I would  like to  take a moment to put things into their  proper perspective.  The ongoing commitment by our  Government, and by our people as  well, to helping Africa in its need for  food and agricultural stability is truly  remarkable and is a vivid reminder of  America's  role  as  the  preeminent  champion of peace in the world.  I get more than a little upset when I  hear suggestions made in some of our  debates around here that the United  States is  the arms merchant of the  world and that, somehow, the interest  and desire for peace that has motivat ed our country's foreign policies over  the years is open to question.  It is sometimes said that the United  States pays  insufficient attention  to  Africa and the problems there. But let  us look at the record. In fiscal year  1983, we provided about 750,000 metric  tons of  food  to sub-Saharan Africa  through emergency humanitarian do nations and our regular food assist ance programs under Public Law 480.  In fiscal year 1984, we provided about  1.1 million metric tons of food to sub Saharan Africa. And now,  in  fiscal  1985, the projections point to a total  American contribution of 2.5 million  metre  tons of  food  toward meeting  sub-Saharan Africa's needs.  Now  let's contrast our record with  that of the Soviet Union. Over the last  2 years, the Soviet bloc has provided  less than 20,000 metric tons of food to  all of sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover,  the Soviet bloc has entered  into a  series of treaty arrangements with cer tain African countries that have had  the net result of allowing the Soviets  to plunder African fishing waters.  Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in  the RECORD an article that appeared in  the February 7, 1985, edition of News day, which  reports  the astonishing  fact that in 1983 alone the Soviet bloc  caught nearly 1 million metric tons of  fish  in waters off the west coast of  Africa. Entitled ""Soviets Take Food  Off Africa's Table,"" the article goes on  to describe  the efforts our Govern ment  is making  in helping African  countries  regain  control over  their  own fisheries. The text of the article is  as follows:  Sovn:rs TAKE Foon OFF .AnucA's TABLE  (By Daniel S. Mariaschin>  The waters off West Africa contain some  of  the world's  richest  fishing  grounds:  Ample harvests of sardines, herring, hake,  squid and shrimp are recorded annually. On  a  continent  that  is  ravaged by periodic  famine, fish  is a vital food source. In the  West African region, consumption of fish  provides upwards of 50 percent of daily pro tein requirements.  There are a few indigenous fishing fleets  in the area, notably those from Morocco,  the Ivory Coast and Senegal, but most West  African fishing is artisanal-done by individ ual fishermen utilizing small  launches or  canoes relatively close to shore. The major  catches are going  to  foreign  fleets, with  their sophisticated  trawlers and  research  vessels able to find the stocks and capable in  many instances of processing the fish on  board. Since most countries now claim ex clusive rights to waters as far as 200 miles  from shore, foreign nations have concluded  fishing agreements with host countries who  invariably receive  little  in return for  the  rights to their valuable resource.  The USSR and the eastern bloc nations  have been among the principal abusers of  fishing  privileges. According  to  recently  published statistics,  the foreign catch off  West Africa has amounted to nearly 60 per cent of the total harvest. The acknowledged  catch of the Soviets and their client states  for 1983 <the unreported  figures are be lieved by western  fisheries experts  to be  much higher> amounted to nearly one mil lion metric tons. A number of other foreign  fleets, the largest of which are from Japan,  Spain and South Korea, also engage in fish ing off West Africa.  In exchange for the right to fish  these  waters,  the Soviets have entered  into a  number of bilateral agreements over  the  past decade with a group of West African  countries including Angola, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Mauritania  and Sierra  Leone. On the surface of the agreement,  which vary somewhat from country to coun try, look like a good deal for the host na tions: the sharing of stock assessments and  other data, the establishment of fisheries  management and maritime training schools  as well as a portion of the catch, sometimes  amounting to 10 percent to 12 percent of  the total.  A closer look reveals these fisheries pacts  are decidedly in the USSR's favor. Moscow  has not developed an interest in the West  African coastal region only for its value as a  food source. It has been able to obtain port  and anchorage rights, supply arrangements,  the right to fly in fresh crews and the per manent stationing of ""fishing ministry rep resentatives"" in host ports. Along with the  well-known intelligence gathering activities  of the Russian trawlers, each of these bene fits gives the USSR a potential military ad vantage in the strategic central-eastern At lantic region. Though the basic purpose of  the Soviet fleet is to fish, that would not  preclude  its  taking on additional assign ments, including the testing of currents and  gathering  data  for Russian  submarines  plying the Atlantic.  U.S. experts in marine fisheries and Afri can affairs believe some West African gov ernments are beginning to realize their ar rangements with Moscow  are a one-way  affair. In some cases, promises to construct  processing and research facilities have not  been kept. In Mauritania, the research facil ity was built but part of it is off limits to all  but Soviet personnel.  A  fuller  appreciation of  the  fisheries'  value has led some West African officials to  look more closely at foreign fleets, particu larly  the USSR's with  its  factory ships.  There is serious concern that overfishing  will lead to an irreversible alteration of the  biological balance in West African waters.  Even artisanal fishermen are beginning to  voice complaints about the Soviet and east ern bloc catch, which has begun to have an  impact on local economies.  In  response  to  growing  dissatisfaction  with the USSR and what is seen as its in creasing exploitation of one of West Africa's  few abundant natural resources, several fed eral department and agencies including the  Pentagon, Department of State, the Agency  for International Development, the Nation al Marine Fisheries Service, and the Coast  Guard, are proposing two programs to assist  host countries in managing and protecting  their maritime fisheries.  The Pentagon's West African Coastal Sur veillance Initiative would provide U.S. Coast  Guard training to West African navies and  coastal patrols. The objective is to improve  their capability to monitor the fishing ac tivities of foreign fleets in their economic  zones.  While rights to on-board inspection and  surveillance are claimed by all West African  countries, in practice this activity is spotty  and ineffective. Coast Guard training in sur veillance methods and in halting violations  can help re-establish an equilibrium in host  nation-foreign fleet relations.  A companion initiative, to improve West  African fisheries management and develop ment, will be undertaken by AID. A pro gram of high-level seminars and  training  sessions  in such areas as data collection,  stock assessments and monitoring, and the  establishment of effective policies and regu",1985
83,House,99,-0.304,652,3,Mr. FEIGHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of H.R. 607, the Cost Sav ings Disclosure Awards Extension Act.  This important measure would contin ue  the policy of  rewarding Govern ment employees who expose fraud and  waste.  These whistleblowers,  some times harassed by their superiors be cause of their often embarrassing dis closures,  deserve  our  full  support.  They are the often unsung heros in  the war for greater Government effi ciency.  First instituted in 1979, the policy of  providing small monetary incentives to  encourage  cost-saving  disclosures  lapsed at the end of 1984. But it has  already proven its worth. The inspec tors general of the Veterans' Adminis tration, the Interior Department, and  the Labor Department have provided  $6,100 in awards to employees whose  disclosures have  saved  the Govern ment-and thus the taxpayer-nearly  $1 million.  The  inspectors  general  of  these  agencies, as well as that of the De fense Department, have responded fa vorably to this policy and have sup ported its extension as a valuable cost saving tool.  A great deal of rhetoric is heard in  this Chamber and across the country  about cutting the fat out of the Feder al bureaucracy. Here is one piece of  legislation that can give some concrete  meaning to that tough talk. I, for one,  wholeheartedly support it.e  e ",1985
84,House,99,-0.429,652,3,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in strong support of H.R. 607, the  Cost-Savings Disclosure Awards Ex tension Act. This important measure  would once again grant authority to  agencies to present awards to Federal  employees who disclose waste, fraud,  or mismanagement  in  the Govern ment. Since this power expired in Sep tember of last year, the Government  has been unable to give cash bonuses  to  those  diligent  Federal workers  whose sharp eyes have helped reduce  the national deficit.  I commend Representative SCHROE DER  for  reintroducing  this bill. The  Cost-Savings Disclosure Program, by  all accounts, is a cost-effective Federal  initiative. According to the House Post  Office and Civil Service Subcommittee  on Civil  Service,  through October  1984, seven Federal employees had re ceived awards totaling $6,100 for dis closures that have saved over $960,000.  That's a rate of return of which we  can all be proud.  This  legislation should be quickly  passed by  the Congress, and signed  into law. All Federal agencies should  strive to make greater use of the pro gram. But it is important to note that  the bill before us today extends the  disclosure awards to members of our  armed services-an extremely  timely  move, given the concern we all have  for extracting greater efficiency from  our defense spending.  Mr. Speaker, in this time of soaring  Federal deficits, it is essential that we  get maximum value for every dollar  we spend. This legislation will help us  achieve  that critical goal.  I strongly  urge my colleagues  to support  this  vital measure.e  ",1985

88,House,99,-0.392,665,3,Mr. BUSTAMANTE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Montana  for yielding.  Speaker,  not  2  years  have  elapsed since the National Commission  on Excellence in Education issued its  report: ""A Nation at Risk."" The report  was  the object of much fanfare by  President Reagan as a demonstration  of  his  commitment  to  improving  America's classrooms and student per formance. Former Secretary of Educa tion Bell made public appearances,  heralding the President's dedication to  academic  excellence.  The  report  spawned much-needed reforms in edu cational  standards.  The  President  rightfully  brought  this  important  issue to public awareness; but, the ad ministration's pomp and circumstance  over education has become noticeably  muffled. The report now collects dust  on a shelf; its contents forgotten by  the individual who commissioned it.    Since publication of ""A Nation at  Risk,"" our country's educational sys tems have been working more closely  than ever to improve academic stand ards. Implementation of these reforms  will be a futile gesture if the Congress  approves the budget cuts for education  proposed by President Reagan.  If we cut back Government's role in  assisting students to afford the costs  of higher learning-if we reduce pro gram funding for language-minority  students-if we shrink State grants for  migrant education-do we not impede  America's ability to meet our leader ship challenges? We have sacrificed  enough by freezing most programs for  elementary, secondary, and vocational  education. To carry forward  the ad ministration's proposals will  reverse  the progress of education and subse quently the progress of this Nation.  Government's role in education has  been: First, to maintain excellence in  scholastic standards; and second,  to  educate all who desire an education  and are able to pursue it. Proposed ad ministration cuts  renege on our re sponsibilities in meeting these objec tives. Costs of higher education con tinue to escalate. They require finan",1985

90,House,99,0.381,678,3,Mr. WEBER.," I thank the gentleman  from New York for yielding, and I just  want to rise for a very brief moment to  commend  the gentleman  for  taking  this special order to discuss this very  important issue, and especially to com mend  the gentleman because, as he  pointed out, he comes from an area of  the country where  there has been  some political support for the concept  of a nuclear-free zone.  I know what  that is like; my State of Minnesota is  another  such  area  of  the  country  where we have political movements  that are always generating opposition  to our strategic policies where the con cept of a nuclear-free zone has gained  some currency. I doubly commend the  gentleman because I know it is a posi tion that is difficult to def end in his  region of the country as it is in mine.  The only point I would add to that is  that I really think the important point  the gentleman made, the most impor tant point, and the point that I hope is  understood in New Zealand is that we  are  fully  justified, and  in my  judg ment, obliged, to make some kind of a  strong reaction in this country. The  argument that we should soft-peddle  this  issue  for fear of off ending  the  New Zealanders in my judgment is ba sically false. The people in New Zea land need to understand why.  The reason is fundamental and ele mental. That is because ultimately the  strength of the defense of the free  world  is far more dependent on our  ability  to hold the alliance  together  than it is on anything that goes on in  the Eastern bloc. We have managed to  respond  fairly  successfully  to  the  threat  from  the Eastern bloc  ever  since  the end of World War II. We  have shown our capacity  to defend  freedom against the Soviet bloc. What  we are unaware of and unsure of is  how we would fare if the unraveling  process  began  that  the  gentleman  from New York referred to. That is  why it is important for the people of  New Zealand  to understand that al though we respect their integrity and  their sovereignty and  their national  pride, this is a threat to the entire de fense of the Western World and a very  strong reaction from our country  is  not only  justified but obliged in my  judgment.

92,Senate,99,-0.314,704,3,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, the most  popular  budget word  this  year  is  ""Freeze.""  As one of the original four cospon sors of the original budget freeze last  year, I should be pleased about that.  But everyone means something differ ent, and most of the proposals are not  really freezes at all.  Last year  four Senators, Senators  KASSEBAUM, GRASSLEY, BAUCUS, and I  offered what has since become known  as the KGB freeze. As we offered it  then-and as we off er it again  this  year-the KGB freeze  really freezes  every Federal program. Budget  au thority for national defense would be  the same in fiscal year 1986 as its was  in fiscal year 1985. Domestic discre tionary programs would be similarly  frozen. For 1 year, there would be no  cost-of-living increases from any Fed eral spending programs. Physician and  hospital fees would be frozen during  fiscal year 1986.  It is clear today, as it was last year,  that this is the most fair, most even handed approach to reducing deficits  that Congress could adopt. It could  also be adopted with  relative speed  since most of this year's other propos als start off from the KGB freeze as a  base. And it could freeze deficits for  long enough to permit us  to put in  place further efforts to reduce deficits.  I  am particularly  concerned, Mr.  President, that as various individuals  and  groups  seek  to  reinvent  the  wheel-that is  to develop  their own  version of a freeze-we are losing pre vious time and we are increasng con tention and discord.  Of all  the alternative freezes,  the  President's freeze plus is probably the  best known. But his freeze calls for  real growth in defense of nearly 6 per cent while at the same time freezing  or cutting many crucial programs such  as education, child nutrition, health,  and environment. His so-called freeze  has done much to increase the level of  contention and disagreement over how  to deal with this year's deficits.  Most recently, the executive commit tee of the National Governors' Confer ence has proposed what  it  terms a  budget freeze. But this program would  adjust defense spending for inflation  but would not do so for other discre tionary  spending  programs. And  it  would take away an inflation adjust ment  for Social Security  recipients  and others while allowing an inflation  adjustment  for  defense  spending.  While  I  admire  the Governors  for  coming up with a  deficit  reduction  program, I cannot support one which  deals so unevenly with Federal activi ties.  Mr. President, it is critical that we  get on with the business of deficit re duction. Last  year's highly  touted  ",1985
93,Senate,99,-0.212,730,3,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I rise  to applaud Commerce Secretary Bal drige's decision not to send Under Sec retary Olmer to Japan until the Japa nese are willing to get down to serious  negotiations.  Yesterday  I met  informally with  Secretary Baldrige. He told me of his  dismay when Japan's Vice Minister of  Posts and Telegraphs  told him they  wished  to  discuss  again  the  basic  theory and framework instead of spe cific issues-in direct contradiction of  the original schedule.  Secretary Baldrige  is  a  straight shooting and dedicated public servant;  he is not constrained by rigid ideology.  But he is also frustrated-frustrated  by the lack of straight talk by his Jap anese counterparts.  Mr. President, I have visited Japan  three  times.  I have met with  their  businessmen and their farmers. I have  met and talked with Government offi cials.  In my State of Montana, we care a  great deal about  the United States Japanese relationship; Mike Mansfield  provides a special emotional tie for us.  I have a great deal of respect for the  Japanese. And I have come to believe  that their respect for us depends on  our willingness  to be  tough, on our  willingness to see past polite words to  actions. It is only when the Japanese  negotiators  see we  are prepared  to  insist on results that talks will bear  fruit.  And so  I commend Secretary Bal drige's decision. He correctly sensed  that the Japanese Vice Minister's at tempt to delay the substantive talks  was the beginning of an old ploy: Pre vent any serious concessions by dis cussing  the  framework while  time  passes and the deadline approaches.  The Secretary wisely decided to stop  this game before it could begin.  Mr. President, we in Montana have a  special interest in the forest products  negotiations currently proceeding  in  Tokyo. I am glad they are going for ward, but I note  they have run up  against  the  Japanese  insistence on  protection.  It would, however, be a mistake for  anyone to think that I or my constitu ents care only about forest products.  I-and others in this body-are watch ing for progress in all areas under dis cussion.  The Japanese cannot have it both  ways. They cannot expect the United  States to permit Japanese companies  to certify  their products as meeting  our standards while Japan does not  permit U.S. companies to certify their  products meet Japanese standards.  When AT&T broke up,  Japanese  telecommunications  exports  to  the  United States jumped from $600 mil lion to $2 billion. We expect the right  to compete in their market as well, yet  they use licensing and other nontariff  barriers to keep our sales at $300 mil lion.  Mr.  President,  I'm sure my  col leagues  join me in supporting Secre tary Baldrige's decision. He is walking  a fine line: Making it clear we hope to  resume  real  talks,  but  refusing  to  engage in phony ones.  Although  this approach heightens  trade tensions, it seems to be the only  approach  that will  result  in signifi cantly increased sales for U.S. export ers.  THE  INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS  CONTROL  STRATEGY  REPORT  ",1985
94,Senate,99,0.185,730,3,Mrs. HAWKINS.," Mr. President, on  February 14, 1985, the State Depart ment released a document which ad dresses a very important aspect of our  Nation's continued efforts  to stamp  out illegal narcotics. The ""Internation al Narcotics Control Strategy Report""  is,  in effect, a ""report card"" of illicit  drug eradication efforts worldwide.  The report is a major component of  the diplomacy against drugs amend ment, which would cut off U.S. aid to  foreign nations that do not take steps  to eliminate their illicit drug crops.  In this report, detailed information  is provided on the drug-production of  every major nation where drugs are  grown. The disturbing news that the  marijuana,  coca,  and opium poppy  crops were larger in 1984 than in the  year before is also revealed in this doc ument.  The United States currently has dip lomatic  relations with 10 of  the 13  major drug producing nations, and in  seven of those countries, drug crops in creased in the last year. All seven of  these nations receive U.S. aid.  That is why I introduced and gained  enactment of  the diplomacy-against drugs amendment. I realized we were  wasting  a  potentially  important  weapon in the war against drugs. The  diplomatic leverage supplied by calling  for a cut off of foreign to any nation  refusing to take steps to cut its illegal  narcotic  production  is  a  necessary  legal tool.  This is illustrated in the example of  Colombia. The report delineates that  efforts made by this brave nation, for merly the primary producer of both  marijuana and coca,  to eradicate  its  drug crops. As a result of Colombia's  self-declared ""War Without Quarter,""  their marijuana crop has been reduced  by one-third. Colombia continues  to  make inroads in reducing its narcotics  production, accompained by the sus tained aid and support of  the U.S.  Government.  An unfortunate fallout of the crack down of the Colombian Government  on drug production  is  the flight of  drug  traffickers  to other South and  Central American nations. As revealed  in this report, for example, Ecuador  was  discovered  to  have  become  a  major coca producing nation. This is a  great surprise, since in the last State  Department report of this kind Ecua dor was seen as having no ""significant  coca or cannabis cultivation."" The new  report  indicates  that  Ecuadorean  drug-enforcement officials have dis covered in the past year 2,500 to 7 ,500  acres  of  coca  bushes, making  this  nation the world's third largest pro ducer. Peru and Brazil are reported as  having also increased their coca and  marijuana production, and Bolivia is  condemned in the State Department  report  for not having eradicated a  ""single coca plant."" Despite large-scale  assistance from the United States, the  report describes Bolivia as a major dis appointment. Jamaica was also singled  out in this document as a nation not  making sufficient eradication efforts;  and Belize was newly classified as one  of the world's largest marijuana pro ducers.  In Asia,  promises made  to  the  United States by officials of the Thai  Government have begun to pay off,  and  the same situation  is  true  for  Pakistan. Though modest reductions  were, in fact, seen in both countries,  determination has been displayed by  Government authorities of both coun tries to achieve substantial results in  eradication efforts.  Mr. President, as we continue in our  efforts to achieve the eradication of  drug abuse in our Nation, we can see  that  the  diplomacy  against  drug  amendment  is something that could  break the vicious cycle of foreign drug  production, and domestic drug con sumption. The example of Bolivia can  attest  to  the  logic of  this. Between  1981 and 1983, Bolivia received $105.4  million in foreign aid from the United  States. During that same  time,  this  nation  inundated America with be tween 80 to 100 metric tons of cocaine.  This situation, unfortunately, has not  significantly changed. The results of  this report should be viewed by Bolivia  as a warning: Cut off your drug pro duction, or the United States will cut  off its aid. It is as simple as that, Mr.  President, and continued such imple mentation of  the diplomacy against  drugs amendment will guarantee  its  success. Mr. President,  I  ask unani mous consent that the attached article  from  the New York Times, entitled,  ""Drug Crops Are Up In Export Na tions,"" dated February 14, 1985, be in serted in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Feb. 15, 19851  DRUG CROPS ARE UP IN EXPORT NATIONS,  STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS  <By Joel Brinkley>  WASHINGTON.-The  State Department's  annual report on worldwide narcotics pro duction shows that in most of the major  ",1985
95,Senate,99,0.078,743,3,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join my distinguished col league,  the Senator  from Michigan,  and other colleagues  in  introducing  legislation  to extend Federal supple mental unemployment for 18 addition al months. While some claim that 1984  was a banner year for the economy,  hundreds of thousands of our neigh bors know only the continuing agony  of long-term unemployment. Accord ing  to  the Department  of Labor,  325,000 people, who  lost  their  jobs  through no fault of their own, receive  supplemental unemployment compen sation as their main source of income.  They will lose all unemployment bene fits when  that program, which has  kept their hopes alive, automatically  expires on March 31.  Mr. President,  this  legislation ad dresses urgent needs throughout our  Nation. Many unemployed persons re ceive benefits for only a short time  before finding another job, but many  live in regions where there has been  no recovery. Long-term unemployment  has been on the rise, up from 1,266,000  persons out of work  6 months or  longer in January, 1981, to 1,402,000 in  December  1984. During  that  same  period,  the average length of unemrose  by more  ployment nationwide  than 20 percent.  The ripple effects of unemployment  on  our National,  State,  and  local  economies are tremendous. Local busi ness is particularly hard hit, as unem ployed persons become unable to pur chase even  the most basic commod ities. The  assistance  these benefits  have provided are of critical  impor tance. I urge my colleagues to join me  in cosponsoring this urgently needed  measure.e  e ",1985
96,,99,-0.429,782,3,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to an outstanding  religious leader and community activ ist, Rabbi Edgar Gluck whom I have  been privileged  to know  for over a  decade. Rabbi Gluck is one of those  extraordinary men who are blessed  with enormous energy and personal  commitment which enables  them  to  work tirelessly for the good of others.  Rabbi Gluck has served the people  of New York not only as a  religious  leader, but as an effective civil servant  who knows the intricacies of our local  and State government. But he is also  no stranger in Washington, where he  has come over the years to lobby and  to testify on the importance of com munity anticrime programs,  juvenile  justice services, and the need for im proved health and mental health serv ices. You are as  liable  to see Rabbi  Gluck in Albany, as at the city council,  or in the Halls of the Congress, for he  is  a  community  leader who under stands the importance of taking one's  message wherever the decisions affect ing a community are made.  Sometime ago Rabbi Gluck's enor mously creative mind dreamed up the  concept of the Hatzohol, a volunteer  rescue squad that would be equipped  with the most modern medical  techFebruary 26, 1985  nology and staffed with trained com munity people. As usual with Rabbi  Gluck, he was able to communicate his  concept and work with other commu nity leaders until this important auxil iary emergency health service became  a reality. Thanks to the trailblazing of  Rabbi Gluck and his associates, many  other Jewish communities have now  organized similar Hatzohol units.  Rabbi Gluck has also worked to im prove the health care services for the  Borough Park area by serving as a  member of the board of directors of  Maimonides Hospital's Mental Health  Board and chairman of  its Political  Action Committee. Because  of  his  many years of experience with public  safety issues, Rabbi Gluck now serves  as chairman of the Rabbinical Police  Liaison Committee of New York State.  In that role, Rabbi Gluck serves as an  important interpreter of the needs and  concerns of  the community  to our  State and local law enforcement offi cials.  Mr. Speaker, President Reagan has  constantly reminded us all of the im portant role that dedicated communi ty leaders like Rabbi Edgar Gluck play  in improving the quality of life of our  cities, towns, and neighborhoods. It is  a marvelous indication of the vitality  of American democracy that so many  of our  citizens  remain willing  and  eager to work for the good of their  communities.  May the good example of men like  Rabbi Gluck inspire our youth to con tinue this important tradition of vol unteer service. For, without the dedi cation and philanthropic commitment  of people like Rabbi Gluck, our com munities would be far less hospitable  places  in which  to  live and raise a  family .

97,,99,0.269,782,3,Mr. COURTER.," Mr. Speaker, dis cussion of future arms control agree ments with the Soviet Union naturally  includes  the matter  of  compliance  with past agreements. Recently  the  President has made public a  list of  seven  Soviet  violations  of  existing  arms  control  agreements which he  deems certain, and the General Advi sory Committee report finds nine posi tive  violations. Both  surveys  detail  many other violations of less certain ty. The most notable violation, and  some of its political implications, was  reviewed by  the Washington Post's  editors in an editorial of February 5,  1985, which I commend to the atten tion of my colleagues:  The editorial follows:  ",1985
98,,99,-0.174,795,3,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  take this opportunity to commemorate  the 67th anniversary of the independ ence of Estonia. On February 24, 1918,  the hopes and desires of the Estonian  people were realized with a declaration  of independence proclaiming Estonia a  free democratic republic.  For  the next  two decades, peace,  prosperity, and freedom flourished in  this Baltic State. The Estonian people  demonstrated what  a  small nation  could achieve under a democratic way  of life.  World War II, however, ushered in a  brutal era of repression and tyranny.  Stalin  forcibly  incorporated Estonia  into the Soviet Union and embarked  on an intensive campaign of Russifica tion. While  I  am  proud  that  the  United States has not recognized the  Soviet takeover, I am saddened by the  fact  that Moscow's efforts  to com pletely suppress the Estonian culture  continue.  The Kremlin  is  increasingly elilni nating  the Estonian  language  and  ethnic traditions. Estonian mores and  values are being eroded. Many places  of worship have been closed. Religious  and political activity  is  tightly con trolled and any person who expresses  a view not sanctioned by the govern ment is dealt with harshly. A signifi cant number of religious believers and  peaceful dissidents continue to be im prisoned, harassed, physically and psy chologically  abused,  and  subject  to  other forms of inhumanity, for coura geously bringing Soviet violations  to  the attention of the world.  Nevertheless,  even while  enduring  these insufferable injustices, the Esto nian people have not lost their deter mination  to  recover  their  freedom.  They are a brave and valiant people  who are destined to enjoy, once again,  democratic government.  As chairman of  the Subcommittee  on Human Rights and International  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Organizations, I have a deep interest  in the plight of the Estonian people.  The subcommittee will closely monitor  Soviet abuses of its citizens and work  to help those everywhere who are vic timized by  totalitarianism. As a  free  nation, we must continue to support  the Estonian people in their struggle  to remove the chains of oppression.   A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM  HOLSCLAW  HON. HARRY M. REID  OF NEVADA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 26, 1985   ",1985
99,,99,-0.276,795,3,Mr. REID.," Mr. Speaker, it was on  February 10, 1984, when events, un planned and unexpected, changed Wil liam Holsclaw's life-when the hopes  and dreams of a normal 12-year-old  boy were superseded by the struggle to  save lives-those of his two younger  brothers and himself.  During the early morning hours on  that February day, William awoke in  his family's trailer,  located  in Jean,  NV. Smoke and fire had engulfed the  mobile home. After running through a  flame-filled  hallway  to  awaken  his  father, William returned to his bed room to locate his two brothers, Brian,  then 4, and Jimmy, then 3. Because  William's father could not reach his  sons through the flames, William him self found his brothers and handed  them out the window  to his father.  First, he gave Brian to his father and  then returned to the flaming area to  locate Jimmy, who was wedged be tween the bed and the wall. After free ing his youngest brother  from  the  burning trailer, William with his hair  and back burning, climbed  through  the window to safety.  All  three youngsters were  treated  for burns. The two youngest had only  minor injuries. For William, however,  secondand  third-degree  burns  scorched more than 50 percent of his  body and, even now, he must wear a  pressurized body suit  to protect his  slowly healing skin.  Within days of the incident I was  fortunate enough to have the opportu nity to praise William for his bravery.  I would have given a more detailed  tribute, but, because of the rules of  the House, I was limited to 1 minute.  Following is that speech.  He smiles sheepishly when responding-""!  just did what came natural."" Yet, to most,  the story of William Holsclaw's courage far  surpasses ""Normal.""  Earlier  this month, 12-year-old William  bravely ignored flames that were engulfing  his family's mobile home, to rescue his two  younger brothers, 4-year-old Brian and 3year-old Jimmy-one at a time.  ""He stood there and handed those babies  out while he was cooking"" his father repeats  to  the sympathetic  listener. Thinking of  himself first was not William's way when  those flames threatened his family.  3669  By the time his father pulled William out  of  the burning  inferno, William had suf fered burns over nearly 50 percent of his  body. And, William's bravery must continue,  as he faces the many needed skin grafts to  repair his charred body.  I am humbled when I hear such stories of  courage and especially touched about Wil liam, who lives in Jean, NV, a small, isolated  town more than an hour's drive from any  rescue assistance.  I am proud to praise William's unselfish  courage and his sense of humanity-quali ties that, for William, just came natural.  Shortly after delivering this message  to Congress,  I  submitted William's  name to the Carnegie Hero Fund Com mission for nomination. In December,  the commission awarded William the  hero's medal.  It was a great pleasure for me  to  present that medal to William in Feb ruary-just 1 year after his heroic act.  His selflessness and courage have set  an example  for  the rest of us and  helped us realize the value of life.  William is one of the few people rec ognized  annually  by  the Carnegie  Hero Fund Commission. Since 1904,  the commission has honored people  who risk or lose their lives in saving or  attempting to save the life of someone  else. William, who was one of nearly  1,000 nominees for a Carnegie Medal  in 1984, was one of the three youngest  to receive the award.  Though the details of the incident  will fade from the memories of others,  the significance of his heroism will live  on for William and his family. Yes, he  has medals, but he also has  scars.  More important than awards, howev er, and a greater  tranquilizer  than  medicine-are  the  smiling  faces  of  Brian and  Jimmy-two young boys  who will always consider their older  brother the greatest hero in history.e  THE 67TH ANNIVERSARY OF  ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON.

100,,99,0.043,795,3,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am pleased to join in commemorating  the 67th anniversary of Estonian inde pendence. Amidst the Russian Revolu tion  and World War  I,  this  small  nation declared  its  independence on  February 24.  In 1920, after valiantly  struggling for independence during in vasions  from  the Red Army,  the  nation  of Estonia  finally  signed  a  peace treaty with the Soviet Union.  During this period of true sovereign ty, this tiny republic proved the im portance of self-determination and in  insuring the principles of justice and  liberty.

101,,99,-0.569,808,3,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, today I,  and many of my colleagues are consid ering the issue of funding for educa tion. Today,  the full Education and  Labor Committee  commenced  hear ings on the proposed cuts in education.  The  President's budget  includes  a  number of policy changes which are  not necessarily obvious. For example,  on  the  issue of  funding  for  library  services and construction,  the Presi dent has again zeroed out all funds.  His press  releases which summarize  the cuts portray this as a $32 million  cut, but it is really a $125 million cut.  This is clear in the detailed appendix  to  the budget  even  if  it does not  appear in the more commonly scanned  press releases and summaries.  Libraries will  also  suffer  further  budget cuts if the President has his  way. The decrease in the postal reve nue  foregone means,  quite  simply,  that many  libraries will  find  them selves paying increased fees for fourth  class mailing. This double blow has  not escaped the notice of those of us  who  care about  libraries and  their  vital role in the original and continu ing education of our people.  The budget also cuts expenditures in  the  special  education  services  from  $1,321,270  in  fiscal  year  1985  to  $1,306,100  in  fiscal  year 1986. Now  that does not seem to be too much of a  cut, but when you put it together with  the elimination of free mailing for the  blind and the physically handicapped,  it means a great deal less assistance  for those who are clearly in need.  The President has  also  proposed  severe cuts  in postsecondary educa tion. In Federal fiscal year 1984, New  York State guaranteed 393,528 student  loans for a total of $936 million. This  represented 12.5 percent of all dollars  provided nationally through the Guar anteed Student Loan Program.  Based on 1983-84 borrowing, the ad ministration's proposal  to  limit GSL  eligibility to students in families with  incomes of $32,500 or less would elimi nate  95,880  loans-24  percent-and  would  reduce  the  total borrowed by  $221.81 million-24  percent. Under graduate borrowing would be cut by 24  percent and graduate borrowing by 22  percent.  An additional 27,000 graduate stu dents with incomes below $32,500 will  have  their guaranteed student  loans  reduced as a result of the proposal for  a $4,000 cap on total Federal aid from  all programs. Most graduate student  borrowers now  take  loans of more  than $4,000 per year. The estimated  loss from  this proposal will be $34.0  million. The combined proposals will  February 26, 1985  eliminate or  reduce guaranteed stu dent loans for 75 percent of graduate  student borrowers.  Secretary Bennett has  repeatedly  spoken up for the President's budget.  He says that no student will be de prived of an education because parents  can borrow an additional $4,000 per  year  in PL US  loans. The Secretary  does not explain how poor parents will  commence  payment  and meet  the  PLUS installments. This deficit gener ating administration apparently feels  that one way to reduce Federal defi cits is to shift them unto those who  seek an education.  In conclusion,  it is  important that  we all consider just what the adminis tration  proposes.  Cuts  are  spread  across every human service program  while programs related to defense or  the destruction of others are lavishly  funded. This bespeaks a  rather dim  view of the future that I cannot share.  The real and practical peace and pros perity of future America  is best se cured by a greater and more generous  national committment to education.   A CONGRESSIONAL SALUTE TO  THE  MEXICAN-AMERICAN  DEMOCRATIC CLUB ON THEIR  25TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. GLENN M.

102,,99,-0.269,808,3,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  proud to call the attention of my col leagues to the 25th anniversary of the  Mexican-American Democratic Club.  This year's installation banquet was  held in Harbor City on Saturday, Feb ruary 9, and you can be sure that a  great time was had by all.  The club was founded in 1958 and  chartered 2 years later under the guid ance of Manuel Betancourt, Henry  Flores, and Victor Valdez. It was estab lished to help Hispanics become more  actively  involved  in  the community  and, of course, the machinery of the  Democratic Party. Today, the club is  open to anyone who has the vision to  make America a better place to live.  Those who  join  know  that  the  Democratic Party  is  the  hope  for  simple justice of equality, fairness and  compassion  toward  all  our  people.  They stand for basic civil and human  rights and the hope for all Americans  to earn a decent living and a chance to  get ahead. They want to make sure  that the wealthy and powerful live up  to  their  responsibilities  to a  society  that is fair, prosperous and strong. I  suppose the ideals of those who join  and  support  the Mexican-American  Democratic Club can best be summed  up by a 1940 quote  from President  Franklin Roosevelt:  ",1985

If the Senator  from Tennessee opposes it, then I sug gest that he vote no. What I have pro posed  is not related  to  the African  relief bill, which, in fact, it could not  be under  the  rule  that we operate  under here. What I propose is that in  the  provisions  of  the  amendments  which have been added to this bill and  possibly will be added, or implement ed, the money be reprogrammed from  existing expenditures to hold the Fed eral deficit harmless, the logic being a  simple and, I think, irrefutable in that  the farmer  is hurt more by deficits  and high interest rates than any other  factor in our society.  I thank the Senator.  ",1985
104,Senate,99,0.304,873,3,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I share  with our colleague from Kansas a com mitment  to  bringing  our  Federal  budget under control. I appreciate the  reservations she has about  the $175  million  in new budget authority au thorized by this bill. The dilemma we  face is that AID's reprogramming au thority has limits on the amounts that  can  be  transferred. Moreover,  the  identification of specific projects that  can be postponed takes time, and the  emergency accounts are getting peril ously low on funds. I share the hope  that AID can carefully scrutinize  its  present operations and projects to dis cover ways that a significant portion  of  the  increased  authorization  for  emergency programs can be off set by  reductions in other, nonemergency ac counts. It might be a very good prece dent for us to see AID return to the  Treasury  as  unspent  an  off setting  amount at the end of this fiscal year.  I assure  the distinguished Senator  from Kansas  that she will have my  full support and cooperation in press ing AID to review all new projects and  to consider delaying some lower priori ty projects  temporarily  in order  to  keep overall AID obligations as close  as  possible  to  currently  authorized  levels.

It is the same as  it was in 1963 when the Equal Pay Act  was enacted and it is  the same as it  was when title VII of the Civil Rights  Act was passed in 1964. The issue  is  the elimination of wage discrimination  based on sex.  As far back as the mid-1960's shortly  after I came into office as Governor, I  found  I was having difficulty  in at tracting  talented managers  to State  government. In addition, there was no  apparent consistency at that time be tween State departments and  their  wage-setting practices. It is significant  to note that I began by seeking advice  from leaders in private industry in my  State. They  told me  the State pay  structure was not competitive with pri vate industry, particularly in manage rial ranks. We then launched a study  to determine what various  jobs were  worth  in  the marketplace,  to State  government, and how they all fit to gether  internally  in  the State pay  system. We hired the same consultants  who had been advising major regional  corporations on job valuations. The re sults were astonishing. Tradition, ne glect, and lack of analytical models re sulting in overpaying some managers  while  drastically  shortchanging  others. Using methods borrowed from  private  industry we made significant  changes. We  realigned positions. We  raised salaries for some positions sub stantially, and froze salaries on other  positions until they returned to align ment as a result of the studies.  It is important to emphasize that we  were not out to prove that there was  discrimination. It was almost by acci dent that we discovered the disparities  between male and female dominated  occupations in a much broader analy sis of job alignments. Further studies  were initiated to insure that key civil  service benchmark positions bore an  appropriate relationship to managerial  salaries. We found consistent and dis turbing aberrations at all pay levels.  Jobs held primarily by women consist ently were underpaid when measured  against comparable jobs held primari ly by men. For example, animal tech nicians,  a  glorified  term  for  zoo keepers,  received  far higher salaries  than child care specialists. We paid  more to take care of our animals than  our children. It is amazing to me now  that so many opponents of comparable  worth  look on the whole method of  job analysis as being some new and  strange device, unproven and unused.  That simply  is  false.  In  fact,  two thirds of the adult age population are  pay graded by job evaluation methods.  In response to charges that compa rable worth  is as ""looney as  looney  tunes.""  I'd say Clarence Pendleton  hasn't  examined modern  compensa tion management lately.  He  and others have  assailed  the  techniques of job evaluation as being  subjective. All methods of wage deter mination,  including the marketplace,  are  subjective  to  some degree. The  common elements of  job evaluation;  skill, effort, responsibility, and work ing conditions are no more arbitrary  than the abnormalities and distortions  present in the external market place.  The marketplace, they say, is the only  fair  and  equitable  determinant  of  wages. According to this analysis work ers should move from job to job in re sponse  to  the  laws  of  supply  and  demand. Similarly, employers will pay  a higher wage  for  labor where  the  quantity is small and the demand is  high and a lower wage for labor that is  abundance of existing demand. In the  real world,  labor markets are hardly  bastions of perfect competition. Work ers and employers have limited infor mation of job availability and employ ees are not completely mobile, espe cially when  they have accumulated  senority and pension rights. The exist ence of collective bargaining further  complicates this model of perfection.  In fact,  the result of  this collective  bargaining process often results in a  negotiated wage  that bears little ra tional relationship to the free market  and we  are currently  suffering  the  consequences of this in international  competition.  These  distortions  are  amplified  when considering salary setting within  a governmental body as large as  the  Federal or State government. With  nearly 3 million employees, the Feder al Government  is  the single  largest  employer  in  the Nation. Within  the  Federal classification system there are  approximately 7,000 types of positions  that correspond  to  series or grade  levels of pay. The complexity of salary  setting for Federal employees is more  readily  seen when  comparing  it  to  State government and large corpora tions. The State of Washington has  2,300  civil  service classifications. By  comparison, the Ford Motor Co. has  5,000  position  classifications  and  AT&T has approximately 3,350 posi tions under  its current classification  system. A few years ago, AT&T insti tuted a  new  job evaluation process  which took into account technological  change within the industry that had  produced an excessive number of job  titles, many different names for these  jobs and not much difference in  job  content. Similarly, many of the factors  and criteria that are used to determine  wages in Federal pay practices are the  same as they were in 1923 when the  major Federal compensation systems  were established. Since their inception  62 years ago they have never been for mally studied for sex bias. Thus, I be lieve it is imperative that Congress ini tiate a  comprehensive study of  the  wage-setting practices within the Fed eral work force. The legislation I am  introducing today calls for such a com prehensive examination. The intent of  this measure is to seek facts and not  prejudge results.  This legislation establishes a Com mission on Compensation Equity with  representatives selected by the Presi dent, Congress, and employee organi zations. The Commission would  be  charged with the responsibilities of se lecting, from a list prepared by GAO,  a private contractor to carry out the  study itself and of submitting to the  President and Congress,  its  findings  and  recommendations based on  the  contractor's study. It is my intention  that this measure will serve as a vehi cle for discussion of the GAO report  which will be submitted to Congress  tomorrow. This  report, which will  detail the appropriate scope, method ology, and other technical aspects for  studying  the  Federal  classification  system was requested by me, Senator  STEVENS,  Senator  CRANSTON.  and  House leaders last November. It is my  hope  that  relevant  findings  of  the  GAO report will be incorporated into  this legislation and used as guidance  for the conduct of the study contem plated.  The need in 1985 for Federal action  in this area of wage discrimination is  ",1985
109,House,99,-0.298,977,3,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr.  Speaker,  this morning Secretary of State Shultz  told members of  the Committee on  Foreign Affairs that the administra tion will not fund the Contras by di verting economic assistance funds in tended for Honduras. He further as sured the committee that the adminis tration will not fund the Contras by  any method not authorized by  the  Congress.  Thus if Congress refuses to reverse  the cutoff of funds to the Contras, the  administration's  illegal war  should  come to an end in Nicaragua. But one  never knows. Congress must make sure  the administration does not use illegal  means  to  fund an  illegal war. Nor  should we approve legal or overt fund ing which would allow the administra tion and its escalating rhetoric to pull  America into a war in Central Amer ica.  The time to end the war is now and  the only way to do it is to cut off all  funding,  legal  or  illegal,  covert or  overt. There is only one way  to get  this administration to the peace table  in Central America: Drag it there.

110,House,99,-0.374,977,3,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker,  today  this House will consider the Emergen cy Farm Credit Relief Act. This legis lation is critically needed if economic  catastrophe is to be avoided. Let us be  very clear what is at stake: If this Con gress fails to act, or if the administra tion vetoes this bill as has been threat ened, literally thousands of farmers all  across this country will go under.  The ripple effects of their economic  failure will be  felt  throughout  the  economy. In my own State of Michi gan, there are 5,000 farmers that face  bankruptcy  they  cannot  obtain  credit  to plant  their  crops  in  the  coming weeks. Nationally, it is estimat ed that up to 30 percent of all farm  operations could go under.  We need  to understand  that  the  farm crisis is not simply a crisis facing  farmers: It is a crisis that falls on all  of us. If immediate credit is not forth coming it would cripple industries who  supply equipment to the farm commu nity, cripple the financial institutions  dependent  upon  the  agricultural  sector, cripple small businesses, and fi nally could cause the ultimate demise  of our rural communities. It is clear,  that neither our cities or our rural  communities can escape this crisis.  We are  threatened,  literally, by a  path of serious economic disruption in  every region and community  in our  country if we fail to take action. I urge  my colleagues  to pass  this critically  important legislation.  if  U.S. POLICY TOWARD  NICARAGUA  <Mr. STUDDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
111,House,99,-0.444,977,3,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  President of the United States would  have us alter by  force  the present  structure of the Government of Nica ragua. That is tantamount to a decla ration of war.  The President wants Congress  to  resume  funding  for military  oper ations directed against the people and  territory of Nicaragua. That,  too,  is  tantamount to a declaration of war.  The President is unwilling to def end  before the world court the actions of  our Government toward Nicaragua be cause  those actions are legally  inde fensible in the absence of a state of  war.  The President has called upon the  American people to support what he  calls a crusade for human freedom. In  fact, he is calling upon our people, di rectly and through surrogates, to wage  war.  War is a simple solution. It means  you kill  those with whom you dis agree.  It means you kill until  the  other side cries ""uncle.""  Is  the  history  of Nicaragua  simple?  the  simple?  Is this what the struggle for freedom  is all about?  Is this the best we can do?  The answer to these questions, Mr.  President,  is  no. Your  rhetoric  is  empty; it does not persuade.  Put aside  this simple  talk of war,  and join with us in the far more com plex and far more rewarding task of  encouraging  peace,  real  democracy,  and social justice in Central America.  of Nicaragua  present  Is  so  so  CALLING THE CONTRAS  ""FREE DOM  FIGHTERS"" WILL  NOT  REVERSE  FAILED  POLICY  IN  NICARAGUA  <Mr. DURBIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.>  ",1985
112,House,99,-0.362,977,3,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, Nicara gua has been a secret which everyone  knows. The secret war that makes the  headlines and the secret U.S. strategy  of overthrowing the Sandinista gov ernment that even the President now  admits.  The inconsistencies of our policy in  that nation are no secret to anyone.  We drive Nicaragua into the arms of  the Kremlin and we are shocked when  we find them there. We disparage the  efforts of our neighbors for naively  seeking peace through negotiations as  we stoke the fires of war with our mil lions.  We speak of our tradition of free dom in a nation where our legacy of  supporting a dictator is still fresh in  their minds.  President Reagan is a skillful politi cian. He could tiptoe across a beach  without leaving a footprint. But call ing  the Contras ""freedom  fighters""  will not breathe  life  into our failed  foreign policy in Central America or  slow down our steady march toward an  even deeper military  involvement  in  that region.

In less than 3 weeks time from the  date of  introduction,  the committee  has thoroughly considered and debat ed the emergency measures contained  in this bill, and brought it to the full  House for a vote. As far as I know, this  fast track has set a record pace for leg islation of this significance. This truly  should demonstrate to America's farm ers that the House of Representatives  does understand their dilemma, and is  committed  to doing something con crete about it.  H.R. 1035  is not meant to be  the  long-term cure for what ails agricul ture; our committee will address long term solutions later this year when we  develop the Omnibus Food and Agri culture bill. However,  this bill  is a  much needed, prudent effort to throw  a lifeline to tens of thousands of our  Nation's farmers who need short-term  credit assistance to help them stay in  business in the 1985 crop year, and  until a new long-term farm policy can  adopted which will  carry  us  through this decade.  This emergency legislation addresses  the credit crisis in a direct and respon sible way by:  Providing much needed,  immediate  assistance  in  the form of expanded  Farmers  Home  Administration  CFmHAl loan guarantees for operating  credit and debt refinancing;  FmHA direct operating loans at re duced interest rates to recent victims  of multiple weather disasters;  Advance recourse commodity  loans  from the Commodity Credit Corpora tion CCCCl  for use in covering 1985  production expenses, and  Improved terms for existing FmHA  debt adjustment programs.  No amount of credit can take the  place of better prices to farmers for  the commodities  they produce. But  without  the  limited and  temporary  emergency measures contained in H.R.  1035, perhaps as many as one-third of  our Nation's producers may be forced  to leave farming within the next year  or so. This bill is only the first step if  we expect to see the return of profit to  agriculture, but it is a much needed  first step.  As a realistic effort to avoid further  economic disaster which rural America  cannot survive, I urge my colleagues of  the House to support this bill.  ",1985

117,House,99,0.372,1016,3,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to say a  few words  relative  to  Keith Mainland, who is retiring from  the Appropriations Committee.  It is no secret around this august in stitution that key staff members per form  an  invaluable  service  to  the  Members and to the country.  All too often they are unknown to  the public, which is as it should be.  I was once a staff member and I  know there has to be that passion for  anonymity among staffers. There has  to be the desire to get the work done  and avoid  the spotlight. That  is a  noble point of view; but there come  times when it is in the interest of the  Members  and  this  institution  that  public recognition be given  to  truly  outstanding work  by  a  key  staff  member. Today is one of those rare oc casions.  Today  I  speak  in honor of Keith  Mainland, who has been clerk of the  Appropriations Committee since 1972.  I served on that committee for many,  many years, and one picture that re mains in my mind is of Keith Main land seated at the big table during one  of  those nerve-wracking,  end-of-the session marathons in the Appropria tions Committee just off the floor of  this House.  He  is  there like a skilled surgeon,  sewing together a bill from the various  subcommittees, making the thing work  in a way that is as mysterious as it is  successful, and I use that analogy of a  surgeon advisedly. The clerk of  the  Appropriations Committee has to have  the  surgeon's skill, deep and wide ranging  knowledge,  coolness  under  pressure, the desire to help others and  a professional commitment to excel lence, plus the ability to wield a scal pel if necessary.

118,House,99,0.351,1029,3,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  taking this time today to again urge  the enactment of an interstate cost es timate bill. We need an ICE bill now,  and every day we delay we do a dis service to the American people.  The  interstate  cost  estimate  is  a  laundry list of highway projects put  forth by each State. These projects  are funded through the highway trust  fund, which gets its revenue from the  9-cents-a-gallon gas  tax. Under  the  1982 Surface Transportation Act, Con gress must enact an interstate cost es timate every other year before funds  are released to the States. Apparently  Congress  isn't living up  to  its own  rules.  It really is not necessary to go into  detailed history of the interstate cost  estimate legislation of last year. The  bottom line is that, primarily because  of  a  fundamental  disagreement be tween  this body and  the other one  over  the  issue  of  demonstration  projects, we failed to approve last year  about $7 billion  in highway project  funding to cover an 18-month period.  The consequence of our failure  to  act is that some 42 States, including  my own State of Wisconsin, are eff ec tively out of highway  construction  money.  The American  people  are  paying 9 cents  in Federal  taxes for  every gallon of gasoline they buy. But  they are not getting a return on this  investment,  because  the money  is  gathering dust in Washington.  The cost of this delay is enormous in  terms of jobs, infrastructure deteriora tion, inflation, and total chaos within  the highway industry.  In all, some 200 highway projects  have been shelved. A quarter million  highway construction jobs have been  put on hold. Each day we delay brings  us closer to another highway construc tion  season.  Problems  of  highway  safety and  traffic congestion, which  could be eased by the release of high way funds, continue to get worse.  Mr. Speaker, last December I wrote  to all 50 Governors to request their  help  in  pushing  the  congressional  leadership for quick passage of an ICE  bill  in the 99th Congress. Their re sponses to me indicate just how seri ous  is  the problem  the States are  facing. I  include their letters, as fol lows:  OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR,  STATE CAPITOL,  Austin, TX, January 15, 1985.  Hon. TOBY ROTH,  U.S. Representative, Cannon House Office  Building, Washington, DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN ROTH: Thank you for  your letter concerning the need for Con gress to act quickly in approving the Interstate Cost Estimate so that federal highway  funds can be released to the states.  I wrote to Speaker Tip O'Neill in early De cember urging him to resolve the deadlock  surrounding this issue. I have also been in  contact with the Texas Congressional dele gation concerning these funds.  These  federal  funds are crucial  to  the  timely completion of the Interstate High way System in Texas and I will continue to  push for a speedy resolution.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE RoTH: I am writing  in response  to your  letter requesting my  support  in urging Congress  to enact  the  Interstate Cost Infrastructure measure.  As a Governor, I am extremely concerned  with the failure of Congress to approve the  ICE and the Interstate Substitute Cost F.sti mate which were submitted by the United  States Department of Transportation  in  March 1983. Because of this impasse, Con necticut has been unable to spend approxi mately $114 million of Interstate Funds and  $138 million  of  Interstate  Substitution  Funds. Further  delays  in  authorization  could jeopardize over $200 million in badly  needed Infrastructure renewal projects.  I have been in constant contact with our  Congressional delegation  requesting  their  support in obtaining the necessary approval  for these funds. Please be assured that I will  continue to work towards passage of this  measure.  Sincerely,  WILLIAM A. O'NEILL,  Governor.  COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA,  OFFICE OF THE GoVERNOR,  Richmond, VA, December 27, 1984.  Hon. TOBY ROTH,  House of Representatives, Cannon House  Office Building, Washington. DC.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN RoTH: Thank you for  your letter of December 4, 1984, regarding  the problems created by the failure of Con gress to approve the Interstate Cost F.sti mate.  As I am sure you are aware, Virginia's con gressional delegation has been active in pro testing delay  in  the release of  interstate  construction funds. To date, Virginia has  been able  to award some $66 million  in  interstate contracts under the ACI provi sions of federal statute. However, contracts  and modifications  to work already under  way estimated to cost over $40 million are  being delayed. Further, if Congress does not  act on the ICE before May 1985, almost  $190 million  in  interstate  contracts and  modifications will need to be deferred. In  my view, Congress must act responsibly and  pass a ""clean ICE"" at the earliest possible  opportunity  in the new Congress.  I  trust  that all members are very much aware of  this need, and that responsible action will  be forthcoming.  I appreciate your keeping me advised of  your efforts in reaching a solution to this  problem.  Sincerely,  CHARLES S. ROBB.

DEAR  REPRESENTATIVE  ROTH: We  are  pleased  to  acknowledge  receipt of your  letter of December 4. 1984 and, of course,  share your concern for the failure of Con gress to pass legislation releasing withheld  Highway Interstate Funds. Fortunately, due  to the foresight of the executive and legisla tive branches of state government in provid ing sufficient state funding  to underwrite  interstate projects, the interstate system is  virtually complete in New Mexico. A release  of withheld highway funding will be applied  to converting ACI Projects <advance con struction  interstate)  projects  to  federal  funds intended to reimburse a state revolv ing account established by the State Legisla ture.  Therefore, the problem is not as acute in  New Mexico as in other states. Nevertheless,  we are concerned by  the fact  that state  funding should be  reimbursed by federal  funds as soon as possible, to maintain the  ability of the State of New Mexico to con tinue to provide funding for matching avail able federal aid.  We will continue to address the problem  through our  congressional  delegation  to  appeal to House Speaker Tip O'Neill and  others regarding the necessity of breaking  the log jam which has prevented passage of  a bill to release withheld interstate funding.  We are attaching a copy of the resolution  adopted by  the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials  <AASHTO) which  the New Mexico State  Highway Department supported.

121,,99,-0.349,1094,3,Mr. MRAZEK.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  often said that for every dark cloud,  there  is  a  silver  lining. For Jewish  people in the Soviet Union today, the  opposite  seems  to be  the case;  for  every silver cloud-the dream of emi grating  to  Israel-there  is  a  dark  lining-the Soviet Government. In the  last 6 years,  the world has seen the  number  of  Jews  allowed  to  leave  Russia rapidly dwindle from a high in  1979 of 51,320 people  to an abysmal  896 in 1984. Recently, and apparently  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  in concert with the policy of meager  emigration, the Soviet Union has in tensified its propaganda campaign to  discredit the refusenik population.  In November 1984, a 27-minute docu mentary aired on Leningrad television.  Titled  ""Hirelings  and Accomplices,""  the show sought to equate Soviet Jews  who seek  to emigrate  to Israel with  anti-Soviet behavior. Accompanied by  strains of Jewish music and footage of  the  Israeli-Arab military  confronta tion,  the film attempted to unfold a  Zionist conspiracy operating together  with the Central Intelligence Agency  and  influential powerbrokers of  the  American Jewish community. Its com mentators  allege  that  Jews  in  the  U.S.S.R. have been targeted for mass  emigration,  specifically  designed  to  provide  ""cannon  fodder  for  Israel's  continuing offense against  the Arab  world.""  It is ironic that at the most promis ing time in U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations in  over 4 years,  that the Soviet Union  has chosen this time to manifest its  anti-Semitic policy agenda.  Today, 3 million Jews are caught in  a  catch-22  of  the  highest  order,  trapped in a country that is impossible  to  live  in-and  impossible  to  leave.  Jews who  try  to  leave  the Soviet  Union face years of living  in  limbo.  Once a Jew applies for an exit visa he  is dismissed from his job, and then ar rested for not having one. Even if it is  possible to avoid arrest, it is impossible  to avoid becoming a social outcast, and  impossible  to avoid  the harassment  and watchful eye of the KGB. Fami lies who apply for visas together can  expect cruel separation. If the Soviet  Government does grant a visa, it may  be only for a husband but not a wife,  or only a mother but not a child.  The grim reality of Soviet life today  for its Jewish citizens evokes the worst  in Orwellian  prophecy-1984  repre sented the worst year in terms of al lowable emigration  from  the Soviet  Union in nearly two decades. Coupled  with the increased propaganda effort  by the U.S.S.R. to discredit Jews, life  in Russia has sunk to an unprecedent ed horrendous level. These two factors  make it exceedingly clear that 1985 is  not the time to relax the vigilance on  these issues.  I encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to join in working for  the freedom of all Soviet Jews. In the  days and months ahead, as the United  States and Soviet Union once again  join  in peaceful dialog,  the  issue of  freedom for Soviet Jews must be high  on  the agenda. Soviet Jews ask for  nothing but  the opportunity  to be  free. As the leaders of the greatest de mocracy in the history of the human  race,  it is essential to do everything  within our powers to grant them this  wish. We must provide the silver lining  of freedom around this ever darkening  cloud of oppression.   February 27, 1985  CREDIT CARD SURCHARGE BAN  HON. DAVID DREIER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 27, 1985  e ",1985
122,,99,0.478,1094,3,Mr. DREIER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, in the year ahead, the House  is almost certain to debate a ban on  credit card surcharges. The previous  ban expired over a year ago. In the  quiet before  the  impending lobbying  blitzkrieg in favor of a new temporary,  or possibly permanent ban, the follow ing article from the Los Angeles Times  is well worth reading. Its conclusion is  especially noteworthy:  The whole debate is almost academic, al though it keeps surfacing. In the year since  the surcharge expired, virtually nobody has  started the practice. And apart from gas sta tions, fewer than 6 percent of retailers <one  estimate says 0.2 percent offer discounts.  And why should  they,  since  its entirely  their choice.  I believe a credit card surcharge ban  is anticonsumer. More to the point, its  probably unnecessary.  I ask that the Los Angeles Times ar ticle be submitted to the RECORD  for  the benefit of my colleagues.  CFrom the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 19851  WHY DON'T CASH PAYERS GET CREDIT  THEY'RE DUE?  (By S.J. Diamond)  The  trouble with knowing how charge  cards work-what the credit costs consum ers, what the processing costs merchants-is  that one senses what such systems must add  to the price of goods. ""Credit card services  obviously cost something,"" complains one  California shopper, ""and it's obviously built  into everybody's price. If I don't use that  service, I should pay less than people who  do.""  As it happens, people, have been urging  two-tiered pricing for years. Most retailers,  however, see no advantage in making the  change, and ""third party"" card  issuers banks, MasterCard,  American  Express,  among others-actively  lobby  against  it,  given the possible decrease in card use. Un fortunately, both sides approach the issue  mostly with rhetoric, with no definitive ac counting of the costs of charge sales or the  likely effect of changing the system.  It seems generally  agreed  that charge  sales cost more, given both handling costs  and the processing fees that merchants pay  banks or card companies. Checks,  too,  in volve both handling and risk, of course, and  even ""taking cash is not free,"" says Ameri can Express Vice President Adrienne Cleere  at  its Western headquarters  in Torrance,  what with higher security, pilferage, book keeping. But all  things  considered,  says  Joanna Logsdon, general credit manager for  Bullock's stores in California, ""the cash cus tomer is less expensive.""  How much less is another question. A 1983  report from the Federal Reserve System's  board of governors gave the added cost of  credit card use as 2 percent or 3 percent of  the purchase-an estimate seemingly con firmed by gasoline dealers, who alone have  widely  adopted  two-tiered  pricing: Many  give people who pay cash a few cents off the  posted price of a gallon because distributors  ",1985
123,,99,-0.506,1107,3,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker,  federally  funded  research  programs at U.S. universities demon strate the versatility and strength in herent in the conduct of basic scientif ic research in this country. I point to  an example of this in my own congres sional district  through  the Depart ment of Physics at University of Cali fornia in Riverside. I had the pleasure  of seeing  the physics programs first  hand as a Regent's Lecturer for the  1984-85 academic year. I am very fa miliar with the activities of Prof. A.  Kernan and her team studying proton antiproton  interactions at very high  energies, Prof. B. Shen and his team  studying electron-positron interactions  at high energies, and Prof. S. Fung  and his team studying the interactions  of relativistic heavy-nuclei.  I speak with particular pride about  our support of such basic research in  the high energy physics and nuclear  physics which enabled,  for example,  Professor Kernan and her  team  to  make important contributions to the  experiment at CERN which led to the  discovery of the long-sought-after in termediate vector bosons-the W and  Z particles. These particles are be lieved to be the carriers of one of na ture's four basic forces,  the so-called  weak force, which is known to be re sponsible for, among other things, ra dioactivity. Moreover,  scientists  be lieve that the discovery of these inter mediate vector particles become  the  strongest experimental support so far  for  the unification of  two of  these  forces, the weak force and the electro magnetic  force. Therefore  it  is  be lieved to be the first and the most cru cial  step  toward validating  the  so called  grand  unification  theories,  which bind  together all of  the four  basic forces, from the force governing  nuclear interactions, to the force re sponsible for the motions of planets  and galaxies.  Federal funding for basic scientific  research at  the universities has, of  course, made all this possible. In the  past years, the Reagan administration  has supported research for particle ac celerators and other nuclear physics  facilities. This year, however, the level  of  funding has declined. Operating  funds for high energy physics facilities  are scheduled to drop from $546 mil lion to $51 O million, and as a  result  utilization of the accelerators will fall  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to between 55 and 45 percent of capac ity. Similarly, nuclear physics funding  is slated to decline. This is particularly  alarming if the universities are slated  to take the brunt of the cuts.  Mr. Speaker,  the backbone of our  scientific  and  technological  preemi nence is our commitment to basic sci entific research conducted by universi ties. This is no less true of our commit ment to highenergy physics research.  I urge my colleagues to consider this  as we examine the Department of En ergy's basic research budget.

127,Senate,99,-0.598,1120,3,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  would the ""clear possibility"" of nucle ar winter help deter nuclear war? It  certainly should. The prospect of nu clear  winter  should  significantly  reduce the ranks of those who still be lieve that a major nuclear war would  only differ from a major conventional  war in degree. They believe it would be  bigger, more deadly, but still a war  that would come and go,  leave heart  breaking casualties. But then the war  would end. The United States and  other  nations would  rebuild.  Life  would go on. Some arg?!e that the su perpowers could fight a nuclear war  without  targeting cities. And  indeed  the principle deterring effect of nucle ar winter would be to help spare the  cities as nuclear winter  targets, be cause it is precisely the fires  in the  cities that would trigger the devastat ing world wide environmental calamity  of darkness and bitter cold with the  ensuing  catastrophic  destruction  of  the world's food supply. But realists  will recognize that the stakes would be  so high and rapid-fire decisions so im perative in a superpower nuclear war  that no risk, including the risk of all  the horrors of nuclear winter would be  enough  to deter the destruction,  in cluding demolition of cities once the  war starts. Furthermore, military tar gets are so close to population centers  that millions  of  civilian  casualties  would be a certainty and once either  superpower  suffered urban destruc tion, it would be likely to retaliate in  kind.  So the prime deterrence would have  to come at the very beginning before  the first nuclear weapons ignited all out war. And here is where the 85 per cent of the world's population living  outside either superpower would have  the most intense interest. The two su perpowers between  them have more  than 95 percent of the world's total  nuclear weapons arsenal. That means  that under present circumstances only  the superpowers could initiate a war  that would be destructive enough to  trigger a nuclear winter. So seven out  of eight human beings on Earth would  be  innocent bystanders,  condemned  through no  fault of  their own  to  suffer weeks of darkness, months of  cold and years of starvation and death.  If the nuclear winter thesis is correct,  and our highest scientific authority  calls it a ""clear possibility,"" that any  superpower initiation of nuclear war  for whatever reason would mean a dec laration of war on mankind every where.

While I commend my colleagues for  their statesmanship and compassion in  considering aid for  the hundreds of  thousands in danger of starvation in  Africa, there has been little mention  of the Ethiopian Government's failure  to effectively anticipate and amelio rate famine conditions in its own coun tryside.  For months, Colonel Mengistu and  the Dergue, Ethiopia's ruling organiza tion, blocked efforts of foreign report ers to bring this tragic story to the at tention of the outside world. In Sep tember 1984, a  large number of jour nalists were permitted into Ethiopia,  but they were confined to the capital  city of Addis Ababa. They were invited  to cover the glorious celebration of the  Communist regime's 10th anniversary,  not the mass starvation occurring in  the countryside. The celebration was  very extravagant and very expensive.  Estimates of the cost ranged as high  as $200 million. The British press re ported that $500,000 worth of whiskey  had been imported for the occasion.  The celebrants enjoyed a new $5 mil lion bronze statue of Lenin, in addition  to color television, another luxury the  Government  introduced at a cost of  millions of dollars.  All this at a  time when an Austra lian envoy who had been sent to deliv er food for the starving had to wait 8  days before he could obtain transpor tation to get the food on its way. Fur thermore,  three aid ships bound for  the Eritrean Province have had their  cargoes confiscated, including a drill ing rig for water.  As we  supply much-needed assist ance to Ethiopian famine victims, this  body must recognize that the Ethiopi an Government has not only failed to  assist  fully  in aiding starvation vic tims, but has actually hindered relief  efforts. Instead of diverting resources  toward the reclamation and rehabilita tion of its agrarian lands, it has chosen  to equip its 500,000-person military or ganization. To this end, I recently in troduced House Concurrent Resolu tion 43, a measure that criticizes the  Ethiopian Government for  its negli gence and  irresponsible behavior  in  the face of widespread hunger.  Mr. Chairman,  I  strongly support  the efforts of Congress  to help the  suffering going on in Africa, but the  United States cannot solve the prob lem alone. The Ethiopian Government  must not hinder relief efforts.  Mr. Chairman, a clear message must  be transmitted to the Government of  Ethiopia that the U.S. relief system is  not available for its individual and po litical disposal, and  that  those who  seek to assist famine victims will no  longer abide by further restrictions or  hindrances.

My colleagues  and I have been working for several  months to determine what kind of as sistance  is  needed,  including  food,  medicines,  blankets,  transportation,  and other vitally important measures  to alleviate the terrible suffering.  I led a delegation sponsored by the  Speaker  to Ethiopia  last November.  One of the other principal sponsors of  this  legislation,  the gentlelady from  New Jersey [Mrs. RoUKEMA], who  is  the ranking minority member of the  Select Committee on Hunger,  joined  me on that trip. We witnessed thou sands of people who, for lack of food,  medicines,  shelter,  and other basic  supplies, were experiencing great suf fering. We also saw  the great work  being carried out by private voluntary  organizations  and  the Agency  for  International Development in provid ing food and other necessities. But the  need far outstrips even the generous  levels of aid already going to Ethiopia  and other African nations affected by  the drought.

I  think we all know that  time  is of essence out there on the  farmlands of this country.  This bill basically does three things.  One, it provides yes the $1 billion in  credit that is necessary for many of  our farmers to continue and also for  many of our lending institutions to be  able to stay with our farmers, because  it is that serious out there in the farm land and  the country  there where  many of our farm banks are going  under. We have had more bank clo sures  in Oklahoma  than  since  the  Great Depression.  The second  thing  this bill does  is  allow the $17 million to provide the  personnel to review farm loans.  I  think  this  also  indicates what  many of us know, there has got to be  some revamping in the USDA to make  it more efficient and more effective in  carrying out  the programs  for  the  farmer and also for rural development.  But Mr. Speaker, I want to commend  the chairman and address  the  third  phase and that is the phase that has  $500,000 in it to provide the dollars to  review the policies that we have con ducted in the past decade that have  not allowed us to meet the competitive  markets around the world.  The Secretary of Agriculture calls  on an agriculture policy and the Presi dent has concurred and has endorsed  what he calls  the  free market. Mr.  Speaker, I  think most of us who are  acquainted with the farmers and the  agriculture policies of  trying to pro vide international trade of those farm  products realize that we do not have a  free market system.  0 1450  But we need to be calling, yes, for  that fair market, because you do not  have a free market when other govern ments, other foreign countries, subsi dize their products, where other for eign countries actually give metric ton nage bonuses  if other countries will  purchase their products, and where we  have a free market, when other coun tries will do whatever is necessary to  subsidize that export of their product.  Mr. Chairman, I think we all realize  that our farmers, basically, have not  had a free market when they have fol lowed the advice of the Secretary of  Agriculture at a time when we made  our last basic good profit on the farm,  and that was back in 1972, 1973. When  the Secretary of Agriculture said, ""Go  out and plant fence row to fence row,''  our farmers responded and did what  our Government told them to do. And  then the markets were pulled out from  under them.  The same thing under the Nixon ad ministration when we had the embar go on soybeans and, yes, under our  own administration, when President  Jimmy  Carter  had  the  embargo  against the grain.  A lot of people out there in America  said,  ""Why  treat  the farmer differ ent?"" The farmer has not had a free  market. They have been,  really,  a  pawn of whatever Government policy  might come down the road. I question  our policies, as our chairman has said,  a policy that allows us to sell military  weaponry to 125 countries that we do  sell American surplus food. I question  whether that policy is going to lead to  the peace that we want around the  world if we are not willing to provide  the food but if we are willing to actu ally sell military weapons. I question  the policy, yes, that can claim credit  for getting inflation down but closes  their eyes  to  the deflation  in  land  values, the loss of land values. In my  State of Oklahoma, agricultural land  has dropped 30 percent  in value 3  years in a row, the first time since the  Great Depression,  and our  farmers  have not been able to go in, since they  have not made a profit, on one hand,  and since they have lost their equity,  on the other hand, they cannot go in  and refinance those loans and be able  to stay in business.

139,House,99,0.284,1289,3,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to bring  the attached  letter  to  Ethiopian President Mengistu to my  colleagues' attention.  I  recently returned from a  trip to  Ethiopia sponsored by World Vision  which included two nights at a feeding  camp at Alamata. The memories of  the thousands of starving people, the  squalid  conditions  of  the  feeding  camps and the faces of the individual  Ethiopians who begged me for help,  are unforgettable. These memories, as  well as discussions I had with private  voluntary organization workers  and  Ethiopians  there,  and  people  from  within the administration and private  voluntary groups after my return have  contributed to my concern about deliv ery of food to the northern region of  Ethiopia, which is expressed in the fol lowing letter.  Progress has been made in supplying  the Ethiopian people with food and I  especially commend the generosity of  the American people who have helped  finance the work of our private volun tary organizations in this effort. How ever,  supplies of adequate  food are  only part of  the problem. We must  engage in every possible effort to per suade  the Ethiopian Government  to  expand  the  avenues  for  assistance,  particularly in the northern region.  I am pleased that so many of my col leagues  have  joined  Congressman  ToNY HALL and me  in signing  this  letter  to President Mengistu urging  him to consider all available means of  expediting donations to the people of  Eritrea and Tigre and development of  a safe passage policy to ensure that  famine relief efforts reach all areas to  Ethiopia.  tamante, Douglas Applegate, Mary  Rose Oakar, Cardiss Collins, George E.

Some of us have had the opportunity to  visit your country recently; all of us have  read press reports or heard accounts from  volunteer relief workers who have returned  from Ethiopia concerning the desperate sit uation confronting your people.  We  are  especially  troubled  about  the  plight of  those  in  the northern  region  where relief agencies have been unable to  reach those in dire need of food and relief  supplies. While progress is being made to re spond to the overall crisis, we would respect fully urge you to take all possible measures  to provide food and relief supplies to the  starving people in portions of Eritrea and  Tigre.  We commend to your attention the cur rent efforts by the United States and inter national assistance organizations to provide  relief, and we encourage you to accept all  offers of assistance by international groups.  In addition, we would encourage your gov ernment to consider all available means of  expediting donations to the people of Eri trea  and Tigre,  including  transportation  across  international borders and develop ment of a safe passage policy to ensure that  famine relief efforts reach all areas of Ethi opia.  In light of the many starving people in  Eritrea and Tigre, it is our hope that famine  aid can be delivered to these areas notwith standing political considerations. Your at tention to our observations and concerns is  appreciated. We hope that our nations can  increase  their mutual cooperation  in  this  humanitarian undertaking.  Frank R. Wolf, Tony P.

140,House,99,-0.422,1289,3,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, we are  aware  that  this  is Black History  Month, during which  time we com memorate the contribution of people  of the black race to the progress of  man and the perfection of civilization.  On Friday of  last week,  there ap peared in the newspaper USA Today a  list of heroic achievements by black  people.  I  include the list appearing in the  25th  issue  of  the newspaper USA  Today in the RECORD today for the edi fication of our Members following my  remarks:  THE ROLE OF BLACKS IN HISTORY  In 1492, Pedro Alonzo Nino navigated the  Nina, one of Christopher Columbus' ships  on his  first voyage  to discover  the New  World.  About 5,000 blacks served in the Continen tal Army during the American Revolution.  Chicago's first settler was Jean Baptiste  Point du Sable, a pioneer trader who arrived  there in 1779.  The third-rail system now used  in sub ways, an automatic air brake, and an incu bator are among the more than 50 inven tions patented by Granville T. Woods in the  1800's.  In 1872, P.B.S. Pinchback served as Louisi ana's governor after the incumbent was im peached.  Chicago's Dr. Daniel Hale Williams per formed the first succesful open-heart sur gery in 1893.  Harriet Ross Tubman led more than 300  slaves to freedom via the Underground Rail road of the 19th century.  Maggie Lena Walker was the first Ameri can woman to become a bank president in  1903.  Singer Marian Anderson, a world-reknown  contralto, sang on the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial on Easter Sunday, 1939,  after  being barred from making an appearance by  the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Blood plasma was discovered and first uti lized by Dr. Charles Drew in 1940.  In 1940, Hattie McDaniel was  the first  black to win an Oscar for her performance  in Gone With the Wind.  ",1985
141,House,99,0.287,1302,3,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr. Speaker,  in the  fiscal year 1986 budget proposals, we  once more are faced with the unpleas ant and, so far, seemingly impossible  task of reducing our Federal deficit.  And, once more, the proposals sug gest that we accomplish this, in part,  by penalizing  the very people who  keep this Government operating-the  1. 7 million Federal civil service em ployees.  I recognize the need for budget re straint, and I stand ready to support  logical,  reasonable  budget-reduction  proposals. But it is unconscionable to  lay this heavy burden on the backs of  the  loyal Federal employees, whose  pay already  lags alarmingly behind  comparable pay in the private sector.  Let us remember-a Federal employ ee is also a Federal taxpayer, and a  father or a mother, or someone just  getting started. A Federal employee  has to buy groceries, make the month ly mortgage or rent payments. And  the cumulative effect of limited and  delayed pay increases in recent years  is making it harder and harder to meet  those financial obligations.  Compelling these employees to take  a 5-percent pay cut is unfeeling and, to  me, unthinkable. The last time such  proposal was made  seriously was  during the Great Depression.  A recent study of comparability of  pay in the public sector and pay in the  private sector showed that our Federal  workers are making about 18-percent  less than their counterparts. In other  words,  they already are doing more  than their fair share of helping keep  the deficit down. To ask them to do  even more simply is not equitable.  One argument used  to rebutt  this  comparability gap is that Federal em ployees  traditionally have had such  superior health and retirement bene fits that such fringes more than bal anced the pay differential. That argu ment has not been valid for a number  of years,  as  the private sector has  caught up with the Federal Govern ment in the benefits packages offered  to employees.  Another argument  that has come  into vogue just in the last year or so is  that during the recent lean years of  the recession millions upon millions of  American workers, particularly those  in unions, had to agree to give-back in  cuts of pay and benefits, so the companies for which they worked could stay  healthy. This argument also is flawed.  If any of us thinks that these unions  did not exact a quid pro quo for the  concessions,  then  you  are misin formed. The unions left the bargain ing tables with packages that included  increased  job  protection.  In  1984,  three out of every four collective-bar gaining  agreements  included  provi sions to protect workers during tech nological  change, work  transfer or  plant closings. Some of  the agree ments  resulted  in  stock  ownership  plans for the employees.  It has been reported that in 1986 pri vate salary increases are expected to  average about 6.9 percent, as the eco nomic recovery continues and private  sector workers begin to reap more of  the rewards.  It is time to let our Federal employ ees  reap  rewards as well, and  they  would be ill-served if they are denied  them. Federal employees have been  denied far too long. They have seen  scheduled pay increases delayed, and  cost-of-living adjustments eliminated  or def erred.  Let me share an alarming statistic  with you. Since 1970, consumer prices  have  climbed  309  percent.  Private  sector workers, during those 15 years,  have seen their pay increase by 291  percent-almost a  break-even point.  But during that 15-year period, Feder al pay climbed only 222 percent-a loss  of  about  one-third  in  purchasing  power.  It is truly amazing that we still have  loyal, hard-working Federal employ ees. This Nation is blessed with dedi cated Federal workers, but Congress is  straining their patience by using the  Federal deficit, year after year, as an  excuse to give them marginal pay in creases.  I have stood on  the floor of  the  House in past years and predicted that  such shabby treatment of our Federal  employees would result in an exodus  of capable, highly skilled workers from  the Federal work force  into the pri vate sector. This is no longer a predic tion, it is a fact. Civil servants are leav ing Government service in large num bers. Top college graduates are being  discouraged from making civil service  a career.  We cannot seriously consider a 5percent pay cut on top of everything  else the Federal employees have had  to shoulder.  I hope the Congress will reject the  pay cut proposal overwhelmingly and  at an early time in the budget proc ess.e  e ",1985
142,House,99,-0.559,1302,3,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I joined  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee in 1978 when I first came to  Congress. During  that  time  I  have  become increasingly aware of what a  tough job civil servants have, and also  what a good job they do.  In many ways, I consider myself old f ashioned. My values are those of an other era. I believe in the family, hard  work, and  in  treating fell ow human  beings with dignity and respect. I also  believe that we are fundamentally a  good country, and that we have a good  Government. When I was growing up,  public employees were considered civil  servants. I still view them that way.  Public  employees  do  serve  the  public.  I don't think they work any  less hard than their counterparts in  the private sector. I think that much  of the criticism that has been leveled  against Government employees recent ly has been unfair and unjustified. It  is the overreaction of individuals who  view public service as merely a tempo rary assignment and as a way to en hance themselves personally.  Cutbacks to well deserved retirement  programs. COLA's, and hard earned  salaries are not the way to insure that  our Government operates efficiently.  It is bad policy, and  it  is bad  for  morale of the many dedicated public  servants who make certain that this  country keeps on running-to borrow  a phrase  from  the Postal Service through rain, sleet, or snow.  Government employees are an easy  mark for this administration. Like the  poor and minorities, they don't have  the clout of other interest groups, but  I know that I and my colleagues on  the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee, as well as many other Mem bers of this body realize just how im portant and how good a  job Govern ment workers do. We all depend on  them daily. Let's appreciate them, in stead of threatening them with unfair  and unrealistic budget cuts.e   ",1985

I, too, am concerned about the admin istration proposals as they affect the  Federal work force and appreciate the  opportunity  to  speak out on  their  behalf.  As you are aware Mr. Speaker, Fed eral workers play a critical role in the  strength of our country. They are the  highly skilled and competent men and  women at the National Institutes of  Health who are performing invaluable  research; the people who make certain  that Social Security checks are paid  on time to our senior citizens, and the  dependable letter carriers. Like most  Americans,  the  Federal  employee  works hard and  tries  to make ends  meet.

Among them are delaying the retire ment age,  imposing severe penalties  for early retirement and changing the  method for calculating annuities. Pri vate sector employers have recognized  ",1985
144,House,99,-0.396,1328,3,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my  colleagues  in commemorating Black  History Month. This is a time for all  Americans to recognize the countless  contributions that blacks have made  to this country.  Blacks have contributed  to every  phase of American society. Dr. Daniel  Hale Williams performed the first suc cessful  open  heart  surgery.  Dr.  Charles Richard Drew developed tech niques for separating and preserving  blood and blood plasma. These tech niques were  responsible  for  saving  hundreds of thousands of lives during  World War II. Crispus Attucks was the  first patriot to die for freedom in the  Boston Massacre, which sparked the  American Revolutionary War. Garrett  A Morgan invented the gas mask and  the traffic light. George Washington  Carver developed more than 300 prod ucts from the peanut and 100 products  from the sweet potato.  The accomplishments of blacks  in  my district  range  from Joseph Cin que's in the 1800's to Florence Sinclair  Virtue's in the 1900's. Under the lead ership of Cinque, a successful mutiny  occurred  aboard  the Spanish  slave  ship  in  New  Haven's  harbor. To blacks in my community,  this mutiny symbolizes the centuries long struggle for freedom of blacks in  America. The late Mrs. Virtue, whose granddaughter Sandra Elaine Dixon  works in my Washington office, was a  dedicated community worker and an  outstanding human being. Mrs. Virtue  came  to New Haven  in  1917  and  worked  tirelessly  in  the community  until her death last year. Her most  noted work was with  the United  Church of Christ of which she was a  longstanding member.  In 1965 when  the church built a housing project it  named it after her in honor of her  dedication and outstanding work  in  the community.  My district observed Black History  Month through a wide variety of ac tivities. The 165th anniversary of the  United Church of Christ was observed  by a  special presentation  titled  the  ""Historical  Perspective  of Dixwell  Church"" at  the New Haven Colony  Historical Society. It included video tapes, music, and readings. The New  L'Amistad  ",1985
145,,99,0.325,1367,3,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, this year marks the 50th anniversa ry of the establishment of the social  security system which today provides  retirement and disability benefits  to  more than 36 million Americans.  The original Social Security Act of  1935 has been modified many  times  since its enactment, but the basic con cept  of  the  program  remains  un changed. American workers and their  employers pay taxes to the social secu rity  trust  funds  throughout  their  working lives, and upon retirement re ceive monthly  benefits  from  those  trust funds based on the amount they  contributed. Congress has been careful  throughout the years to ensure that  the social security trust funds remain  separate  from  the General Federal  Treasury accounts. In this way, it was  thought that social security benefits  would be insulated from periodic polit ical and budgetary pressures. Unf ortu nately, despite these efforts, our Na tion's  social security recipients have  all  too often been held hostage by  Congress.  Once again this year, there are some  in Congress who continue to suggest  that to reduce the Federal deficit, the  scheduled January 1986 Social Securi ty  cost-of-living  increase  should be  eliminated. A  resolution  I am  intro ducing  today expresses  the sense of  the Congress  that Members of  the  House and Senate refrain from any  consideration of  legislation  to elimi nate, postpone, or reduce Social Secu rity cost-of-living adjustments. As the  resolution states, many Social Security  recipients  rely on  these benefits as  their only source of income and the  cost-of-living  adjustments  as  their  only means to offset increased prices  for goods and services including food  and medical care. The resolution also  reaffirms the fact that the Social Se curity trust funds should not only con tinue  to operate  independent of the  General  Treasury  accounts,  but  should also be considered separate for  accounting purposes.  Congress created in 1939 a separate  trust fund for the Social Security Pro gram, which was not included with the  Federal  budget  submitted  by  the  President and considered by Congress.  The Federal budget at the time only  showed receipt and expenditures paid  into and out of the General Treasury  fund.  For the most part, the Social Securi ty trust fund has operated throughout  the program's history with a surplus  of funds. In an effort to capitalize on  4241  these  surpluses,  President  Johnson  began  in  1969  to  incorporate  the  Social Security trust fund into a uni fied Federal budget. Social  security  surpluses were used  in  this way  to  offset increasing Federal deficits.  Social Security was  intended  to be  an  autonomous,  self-supporting  system, funded through employee and  employer  contributions.  For  this  reason, I have steadfastly opposed any  changes  to  the Social Security Pro gram that were proposed not to pro vide for long-term stability of this pro gram, but to achieve short-term budg etary goals.  In an effort to eliminate the incen tive of those who falsely attempt to  reduce the Federal deficit through re ductions  in Social Security benefits,  Congress directed in the Social Securi ty Amendments  of  1983  that  the  Social Security trust funds once again  be  treated as a  totally separate ac count  of  the Federal Government.  Thus, Congress  reaffirmed  its belief  that the Social Security trust funds  should not be included with receipts,  expenditures, and the deficit or sur plus of  the General Treasury fund.  Because Congress delayed enactment  of this accounting change until 1993,  I'm introducting  legislation  today  to  accelerate the process so this account ing  change  becomes  effective  next  year.  Through the years, in addition to ef fecting budgetary savings at the ex pense of Social Security  recipients,  Congress  also  has  sought  political  gains from the Social Security system.  Prior to 1975, Social Security recipi ents were left to the whims of Con gress for their annual cost-of-living in creases. In those years when it was ad vantageous  for  the Congress,  large  cost-of-living increases were approved.  In other years,  there were no  in creases.  One of the first bills I introduced as  a newly elected Member of the 92d  Congress was  legislation  to establish  automatic annual Social Security cost of-living adjustments based on the rise  in  the Consumer Price  Index. Five  months later, Congress approved this  legislation and in 1975, the Social Se curity  Administration  began  the  annual payment of cost-of-living  in creases every year in which the Con sumer Price Index rose more than 3  percent.  The 3-percent level was established  because the Social Security Adminis tration advised Congress in 1972 that  at the time, it was prohibitively expen sive to calculate and administer bene fit increases less than 3 percent. Since  that  time,  however,  I  know,  as  a  member of  the Appropriations Sub committee which funds the Social Se curity Administration,  that  improve ments  in  the  agency's  computer  system have substantially reduced the  ",1985
146,,99,-0.339,1380,3,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am pleased  to cosponsor  legislation  which, in effect, continues our efforts  to revise and consolidate the laws re lated to vessel safety in title 46 of the  United States code. This particular  legislation will update those laws that  relate to a vessel's tonnage measure ment and load lines.  Before a vessel may be documented  as a vessel of  the United States,  it  must first be measured to determine  its gross and net tonnages. They are  used  in  the  collection  of  tonnage  taxes, drydocking,  towing and canal  fees, and a myriad of other charges.  These tonnages are also used as regu latory yardsticks when deciding which  navigational and maritime safety rules  the  vessels  and  their  crews must  comply with.  The major maritime nations have  based their tonnage rules on the 1854  British  rules of measurement, often  cited as the Moorsom system. These  rules for the major part have, through  the years, been so extensively  inter preted that tonnage uniformity never  really existed. In an effort to provide  international  uniformity,  the  U.S.  Coast Guard-representing the United  States at many  international meet ings-has been a  leading advocate of  reform. The result was  the develop ment of the International Convention  on Tonnage Measurement of Ships,  1969 at London, England. This conven tion was ratified by the President on  October 28, 1982, with the advice and  consent of the Senate. It entered into  force internationally on July 18, 1982,  and came  into effect  in  the United  States on February 10, 1983.  Vessels that engage in international  voyages are subject  to  this  tonnage  convention and are required to present  a valid tonnage convention certificate  when entering ports of other contract ing governments. The Coast Guard  with the help of the American Bureau  of Shipping has done an outstanding  job of remeasuring our vessels under  the provisions of the convention to fa cilitate  their operation without any  lost time.  The problem with this legislation in  the past has been its applicability to  the smaller, domestic vessels. They are  February 28, 1985  adversely aff ectd by the international  ~onnage criteria because it materially  mcreases their existing tonnage. This,  ~n turn, subjects them to higher and,  m most cases, unnecessary inspection  and manning standards. This problem  has now been resolved by providing a  chapter  entitled  ""Regulatory  Ton nage"" whose net effect is to continue  measurement of these smaller vessels  under existing  laws and regulations.  This, in turn, subjects them to existing  vessel inspection and manning require ments. However, many of these vessels  would still have to be measured under  the international standards if they are  operated in international trade.  This legislation will also enable the  Coast Guard to apply simplified vessel  measurement methods, in lieu of the  formal and more extensive procedures,  to self-propelled commercial vessels of  less than 79 feet that engage on inter national voyages as well as domestic  voyages. This is a broadening of the  Tonnage Measurement  Simplication  Act  that  I was  privileged  to  steer  through to enactment in 1980.  This  legislation will  also  update  those laws that require load lines to be  conspicuously  and  permanently  marked on each side of the vessel to  indicate  how  deep  the  vessel may  safely  load for the intended voyage.  These markings, in the form of a load  line disc and other lines used in con nection with the disc, are always locat ed amidships or at the vessel's mid length between perpendiculars. The  exact  location of  the disc  is deter mined by the rules of classification so cieties and  the Coast Guard which  take into consideration the details of  length,  breadth,  depth,  structural  strength and design, extent of super structure, sheer and round of beam,  and  other  vessel  characteristics  to  arrive at a  safe minimum free board  for various trading areas. This revision  and consolidation does not make any  substantial or controversial changes to  existing  law,  regulations,  or proce dures.  This is legislation that the adminis tration desires; it is legislation whose  basic  function  is  safety of  life and  property at sea; it is  legislation that  we can all support. I urge your support  and cosponsorship.e  DEFENSE POLICY PANEL  HON. JIM COURTER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 28, 1985  e ",1985

""The Sandinistas are  intransigent  and dishonest,"" Mr. Rivera said. ""How  can we expect Justice of this regime?""  The Times also notes that the Sandi nista war against the Miskitos has re sulted in the deaths of 800  Indians.  More  than 20,000  Indians have fled  Nicaragua for Honduras. Inside Nica ragua, the repression against the Indi ans continues. Mr. Rivera said  that  President Daniel Ortega has broken  his personal promise of October 1984  to  release  some 50  Indian political  prisoners  held  in Nicaraguan  jails.  Many other recent press reports have  confirmed  that  the Sandinistas are  also taking the Indians' homeland in  northern Nicaragua  and  turning  it  into a free-fire zone. The Indians are  being forcibly relocated, their villages  burned and bombed.  Mr. Speaker,  the Times character izes Mr. Rivera as the ""most moder ate"" Miskito leader. If he has finally  seen the Sandinistas' contempt for jus tice and negotiations, wouldn't this  Congress be foolish not  to see  like wise?  The Times article, which follows in  its entirety, is worthy of our attention,  for it illustrates that those who would  withdraw from Nicaragua, would like wise doom the Miskitos to repression.  A REBEL NICARAGUA INDIAN LEADER Is  PESSIMISTIC ON PEACE PROSPECTS  <By James LeMoyne)  SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, April 18.-A leader  of the Miskito Indian rebels says that after  six months of talks with Nicaraguan offi cials,  he has become  deeply pessimistic  about  the prospect of  reaching a  peace  agreement between  the  Indians and  the  Government.  The rebel, Brooklyn Rivera, is widely con sidered the most moderate leader of some  120,000 Miskito Indians, more than 40,000 of  whom are either in exile in Honduras or are  held in Government camps in Nicaragua.  In an interview here today, Mr. Rivera ac cused  the Sandinistas of bad  faith  and  broken promises. His heated comments were  in sharp contrast  to past statements  in  which he expressed optimism that negotia tions could bring positive results.  ""The Sandinistas are intransigent and dis honest,"" Mr. Rivera  said.  ""How can we  expect Justice of this regime?""  He added that he also suspected the mo tives of other Nicaraguan rebel groups who,  he conte:Qded, have failed to aid the Miski tos.  VISITED NICARAGUA IN OCTOBER  ""What I  think is that all nonindigenous  Nicaraguans want to use the tragedy of our  brothers for their own political ends,"" he  said.  Mr. Rivera, 32 years old, traveled to Nica ragua last October in what appeared to be  an effort to end the three-year-old war be tween the Sandinistas and the Indians. The  war  is believed  to have  resulted  in  the  deaths of at least 800 Indians.  Mr. Rivera heads Misurasata, one of two  rival Indians rebel groups that have fought  the Sandinistas  since  1981. More  than  20,000 Indians have fled to Honduras and  the Sandinista Government has forcibly re settled as many as 20,000 others in Govern ment camps deep inside Nicaragua.  Mr. Rivera said he began talks with the  Nicaraguan Government last October when  Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of  Massachusetts, arranged for him to meet  Daniel Ortega Saavedra,  the Nicaraguan  leader, at the United Nations. Mr. Rivera  said Mr. Ortega expressed eagerness to end  the conflict with the Miskitos, promised to  release 50 Indians Jailed in Nicaragua and  pledged land and a broad degree of political  autonomy for the Miskitos.  After the secret meeting, Mr. Rivera said,  he  spent 11  days  in Nicaragua, visiting  Indian refugee camps and villages on the  north Atlantic coast. He also  agreed  to  begin formal discussions with Nicaraguan  officials in Colombia, he added.  But Mr. Rivera said little progress had  been made after meetings  last December  and in March. The next session was sched uled to begin today in Mexico City.  Mr. Rivera said he was asking for political  autonomy, an end to attacks against Indian  villages, control of natural resources and re lease of prisoners.  The Government has not released Indian  prisoners, as Mr. Ortega had promised, Mr.  Rivera said, but has asked  instead for a  cease-fire and has offered him a place on a  five-member Government  commission  to  study the problems of the Indians.  ""To have fought for four years to have  one member on this commission,"" he said,  ""means the Indians will have to fight 500  years to gain their rights-.''  MR. PRESIDENT, CANCEL YOUR  VISIT TO THE GRAVES OF THE  SS  IN  BITBURG  CEMETERY  AND HONOR VICTORY OVER  EVIL  <Mr. DOWNEY of New York asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.>  ",1985
149,House,99,-0.384,90,7,Mr. DOWNEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, a new and haunting name  has entered the American lexicon-it  is Bitburg. And it has become a symbol  of a wound that has yet to heal be cause buried within it lies the specter  of hatred which this Nation struggled  with such heroism to def eat.  .4mericans  remember what  they  were fighting against 40 years ago fascism, totalitarianism, and evil. And  they  remember  the  force  that em bodied  those  things-the Nazi  SS.  Americans  remember  that only  40  years ago, not a long time, this Nation  mobilized to def eat Nazi Germany and  the evil it stood for.  Sixteen million Americans served in  our Armed Forces. Over 1 million gave  their lives; 12 million Europeans were  consumed by the horror of the SS-run  Holocaust;  6 million of  them were  Jews. These memories are still young.  The President's intentions  to help  heal the wounds and bring our Nation  and the German nation to greater un derstanding are honorable and of the  greatest  importance. But I urge  the  President not to undo his good inten tions with a visit to the graves of the  SS.  For these graves hold the phantoms  of a  common enemy-an enemy we  share with all humanity. There, in the  graves where the SS lie, lie also the  dark forces that we are as members of  the community of mankind struggle to  defeat. There in the graves of the SS  lie hatred and violence and horror just as much our enemy as it is the  German people's.  And thus, to honor these graves of  our common enemy dishonors today's  Germany.  Those who gave  their lives  in the  struggle against the evil that the SS  stood  for,  those who  fell  innocent  victim to that evil and those who rec ognize the evil and still fight against it  today deserve the President's and our  Nation's honor.  Mr. President, cancel your visit  to  the graves of the SS in Bitburg Ceme tery and honor victory over evil.  0 1540  TASK FORCE ON INDIANA ELEC TION  ENDS  ITS  CAREER  IN  DISREPUTE  <Mr. FRENZEL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1985
150,House,99,-0.564,103,7,Mr. WEISS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the chair man of  the Hispanic caucus of  the  House of Representatives, the distin guished gentleman form New Mexico  [Mr. RICHARDSON].  ",1985
151,House,99,-0.321,103,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.,"  gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, first of all  I  rise  in  strong  support  of  this  resolution  which in my judgment is the only con scionable thing to do. I do so recogniz ing the great respect I have for my col league  from Mississippi CMr. MONT GOMERY] and my colleague from New  York CMr. STRArrON].  Let me clarify several things.  It is first of all U.S. policy supported  by the administration, it is current law  that military and economic assistance  be denied to the Chilean Government  because of gross human rights viola tions. It was only a month ago that for  the first time the State Department  abstained on a loan in the Inter-Amer ican Development Bank for  further  loans because of these gross human  rights violations that are increasing.  President  Pinochet  scorns  the  United States. Several Members of  Congress met with him recently. I was  in  the last delegation  to meet with  him.  We asked him  in a positive  tone:  ""Will you lift the state of siege?"" Two  weeks later he increased it.  In addition to that we asked him to  ""Please try to make some semblance  of restoring an orderly process of de mocracy."" He laughed in our face.  Lastly we said, ""Could you please  stop that secret police of yours from  contintuing  to  torture  in your own  country?"" He laughed at us.  I  think what  this  resolution  is  simply doing is stating that the United  States recognizes that it has little le verage in Chile but the price in inter national public opinion simply to con duct naval exercises which I presently  support-I do not have any problem  with that-an occasional U .N. vote, is  not worth continuing to associate our selves with a regime that is repressive,  that  is not democratic. Tremendous  unrest is taking place there.  The democratic opposition in Chile  is forming, it is emerging. It does send  a  signal  to  our State Department  which in our judgment has not been as  strong in exercising this quiet diplo macy,  in telling Mr. Pinochet ""Your  human rights violations are objection able."" This is almost a restoration of a  policy that we have followed for many  years. We have denied them military  and economic assistance and now we  are abstaining. This resolution is not  that far from U.S. policy.  ",1985
152,House,99,-0.171,116,7,Mr. HAMILTON.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  under the rule to be considered tomor row on House Joint Resolution 239, I  am required  to have printed  in the  RECORD the amendment in the nature  of a substitute. I ask unanimous con sent  that  the  amendment  in  the  nature of a substitute to the joint res olution offered by the gentleman from  Maryland CMr. BARNES] may be print ed in the RECORD.  ",1985
153,House,99,0.371,129,7,Mr. THOMAS of California.," It seems  to me that one of the criteria that we  should have established early on and  we could have done that by interview ing county election officials, was the  condition  under which  the  ballots  were being held.  It seemed  to  this gentleman from  California that before we could write  any rules, we had to know the universe  over which we were dealing with in  writing  those  rules.  However,  it  seemed appropriate  to  the majority  that there was no need to interview  either the candidates or county elec tiond  officials  in  Indiana's Eighth  Congressional District or State elec tion officials. That seemingly it was  easier and in fact better to write rules  for  the recount without having any  firsthand knowledge of what is going  on.  Several phone calls were made and  the folks were in; they talked over the  phones for a few minutes. If they were  not, we passed on. What finally greet ed us out there was something that I  think sobered up a lot of people. That  is that it is easy to stand on the floor  of the House, as the majority leader  did, and make pious statements about  how unseemly the folks in Indiana's 15  counties of the Eighth Congressional  District  carried  on  their  activities.  When,  in  fact,  if you will examine  what the task force did, it was no more  unseemly than what went on election  day. Those folks knew the territpry;  they knew what they were doing, and  if you will compare election night re sults with  the  task force's so-called  final result, and understand that the  task force was going to count ballots  that were illegal and invalid under In diana law. That they did a remarkably  good job. As a matter of fact, they did  as good a job, if not better, than the  task force.  ",1985
154,House,99,0.353,129,7,Mr. FRENZEL.," Is there anything in  the gentleman's experience that would  lead him to believe  that the  judges  and clerks in Indiana's Eighth District  were any more or less competent or in competent  than election  judges  all  over the United States, including the  gentleman's own district?    I yield to the gentleman for his re sponse.  ",1985
155,House,99,-0.303,142,7,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  if  the gentleman will yield, does  that  presumptively prove that it was an im proper vote?  ",1985
156,House,99,0.497,142,7,Mr. LUNGREN.," No.  The next point that I would like to  make is that proceeding under those 2to-1 rule decisions, under the rules es tablished, the task force then failed to  follow the very rules that they had es tablished and they created an excep tion to those rules, when perhaps it is  by coincidence, i am not going to cast  aspersions  on  anybody's motivation  here, perhaps it was mere coincidence  that on those occasions when they set  aside the set of rules that they had es tablished overcoming Indiana law,  it  happened to go to the benefit of the  Democratic candidate.  Now, the point is that we have some where between 25 and 32 ballots that  are nonnotarized, nonwitnessed,  ab sentee ballots. Those remain in contro versy.  Similarly situated ballots were ac cepted as the vote took place and Mr.  Mccloskey finally, finally, finally got  a lead; but the ballots in the predomi nantly Republican  counties,  either  four or six counties, from which these  ballots came,  those ballots are not  being counted.  .  .  Additionally, we have I believe it is  at least 10, somewhere between 10 and  20 ballots cast by members of the mili tary in which the postmark was prior  to the date of the election, but because  of  the postal  service  they did not  arrive until after the election. They  are not being counted because under  Indiana law they would not be counted.    We  set  aside  Indiana  law under  other circumstances, but not here.  What are some of the things we set  aside under Indiana law? Characteris tics that are marked on ballots. People  say, ""Why worry about that?""  Because if you have any knowledge  of electoral procedure, one of the ways  you make sure that you do not have a  corruption of the system is that you  do not allow identifying marks. Why?  Because somebody can get paid to go  in and vote and how do  they make  sure they get paid? They make a char acteristic mark on the ballot and the  person who happens to be part of that  corruption sees it and makes sure they  are paid.  In one circumstance, we had three  such ballots that were counted for Mr.  McCloskey-three  such ballots  that  had identifying marks for Mr. McClos key that were allowed in, but one that  happened to be for Mr. Mcintyre that  had a number on its back, even though  there was a strong argument that the  number had been made by poll clerks  in counting ballots, not by the voter,  that was not counted.  One of  the very ballots  that was  counted  for Mr. Mccloskey  was  marked by the voter with a star that  Mr. Shumway,  the person  that was  hired by the task force to establish the  rules, had earlier used as an example  of the ballot with the distinguishing  mark  in  training  the GAO  recount  auditors not to count.  0 2000  So in the circumstances in which we  were confronted with the questions on  2-to-1 votes, on 2-to-1 votes on the task  force to decide whether the ballots in  question ought to be adopted, we lost.  We lost.  Now we have somewhere between 23  and 50 ballots that are still out there  and we have been told by the task  force they will not be counted because  they are substantially different. The  testimony, the testimony of the indi vidual who -was given the responsibil ity of establishing whether or not  there was security that was presented  around  those ballots;  that  is, were  those ballots secure  from  the  time  they were handed in until the  time  now, answer: yes to the question posed  to him in  this morning's task force  meeting. He said there was similar se curity with resp~ct to  those ballots  that the Democratic majority is refus ing to have counted as those ballots  that have been counted.  So the question is first of all you  have a man who has been certified as  the winner on election night. Then a  recount is called for by both sides, and  the result of that recount is that he  establishes a victory margin that is  well over eleven times as large. And  then you say no, no, that is not good  enough; we are going to set up rules.  And we have set the rules up and then  the rules are not even followed. There  ,-,  ",1985

159,House,99,-0.217,155,7,Mr. SIKORSKI.," I thank the gentle man for yielding. I do not absolutely  want to intrude upon your proceeding  this  evening,  although  two  points  should be made for the record, as long  as the issues were raised.  The first is that certain people are  not here in part because this matter  was raised and kept secret until very  late in the legislative day, and were  not given the lead time notification.  Second, that when people have at tempted to participate in these discus sions this evening, the time was with drawn from them; they were cut and  others. That is all I care today and I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1985
160,House,99,0.47,155,7,Mr. HUNTER.," I  man for yielding.  I would like to answer the gentle man's question because I have sched uled most of the people who are speak ing now and will speak later on to night. A member of  the Democrat  staff came over and' asked us shortly  after the Republican conference broke  up if we were planning an all-night  session, and one of our staff people  came over and said what should I tell  thank the gentle them, and I said you go back and tell  them we are going to plan an all-night  session and ask them if that is OK  with them.  In doing that also, several members  of the staff for the House came out  and asked me  if  in fact  there was  going to be an all-night session, and if  so, they needed to plan for it so that  they could be accommodated in there  schedules, and I said absolutely.  Then several people called up and  said can we tell the newspapers that  their is going to be an all-night session  and I said ""absolutely."" This was not a  secret session;  this was an idea that  was brought up during the Republican  session today, and we needed to get  enough people on board to see if we  could get enough people to make the  thing go. But once it went we did ex actly that.  I would  like  to hear Mr. PANETXA  give an explanation, and I hope it is a  better explanation than the one that  .hemade in the hearing in Indiana. So  I would welcome his participation. I  would welcome  the majority  leader,  Mr. WRIGHT, coming before the full  House and explaining to us how we  fulfilled his uniformity requirements  that he said we must impose on the  State of Indiana when we went there  and we counted absentee ballots until  the Democrats had a 4-point lead and  then we quit counting absentee bal lots.  So, let me just say to the gentleman  if he thinks there is some kind of a  surprise that has been sprung on the  world by us going on television and ap parently no Democrats knowing about  it for many, many hours, I would wel come the Democrat leadership to come  down here tomorrow morning and con front this issue and explain why they  had  to  impose  this uniformity  that  really was not very uniform on the  State of Indiana and on the people of  the district which elected Mr. Mcin tyre to a seat in the House of Repre sentatives.

166,House,99,0.528,181,7,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," I thank the  gentleman for his comments. I agree  that one vote is important, and it is  very  important  that we uphold  the  Constitution of the United States and  make sure that every individual's vote  does count.  We have talked much tonight about  the historic date of January 3, when  all of us, except one, were sworn in to  be new Members of the 99th Congress.  I would like to mention another date  that occurred approximately 3 weeks  later, and that was the date that our  great  President,  President  Ronald  Reagan, was sworn in for his second  term  as President of  these United  States.  As the Speaker will recall and the  Members in the Chamber will recall,  because of the inclement weather, the  ceremony was held in the great rotun da of this Capitol. I was able to actual ly stand in the rotunda as the Presi dent was sworn in, and I noticed that  the  great American  actor,  Jimmy  Stewart, stood behind the President of  the United States as he took the oath  of office. That made me recollect on  some of Mr. Stewart's great roles in  the movies. One of his greatest roles  was in a movie called ""Mr. Smith Goes  to Washington.""  Jimmy  Stew.art  played Mr. -Smith in that movie and,  as we will all recall, he came from the  great State of Indiana, I believe, and  he was nominated-not elected, but  nominated-to take the place of a Sel) ator  from  Indiana-not a Congress man, not a Representative, but a Senator-and he was nominated because he  was kind of a  rube, and  the great  powers of that day in that movie felt  that he could be manipulated and con troled and would not be a concern.  They were trying to get a dam called  the Willow Creek Dam on Willow  Creek  passed,  and  they  felt  that  Jimmy Stewart would not be a prob lem for  them. So Mr. Smith got to  come  to Washington. They  tried  to  show him the monuments and fix him  up with a young lady as a girlfriend,  but Mr. Smith got it into his head that  he wanted to so something for Amer ica,  that he wanted  to build,  as  I  recall, a boys ranch on Willow Creek,  and that didn't set too well with the  powers  that be. They  tied  to break  him. They tried to grind him into the  dirt. They did everything that they  could, but Jimmy Steward would not  stand for it.  He made an ultimatum to himself  that if he was the only Senator in the  U.S. Senate who  really cared about  what was right for America, he was  going to stop that dam and not let it  come about. As we all know,  in the  movie, he won. He won because he did  what he thought was right.  We are not trying to stop a dam on  Willow Creek, and we are not trying to  build a boys ranch for the boys of In diana. But I think all of the Members  of this body, of the U.S. Congress, the  House of Representatives, do want to  emulate that great actor Jimmy Stew art in that movie and do what is right  for this country.  We are in a situation here where, in  the Eighth Congressional District of  Indiana, we have to make a decision.  Since January 3, the decision has been  that the apparent winner, the certified  winner,  shall not  be  seated. That  man's name  is Rick Mcintyre. The  second  recount  that has  just been  completed-although completed is not  the right verb-that has just been pre maturely  ended,  I  guess, would be  more correct. At this point in time, the  person who has the lead is Mr. Frank  .Mccloskey. At some point in time, this  week or next week, there is going to be  a motion made for the majority party,  more than likely, that Mr. Mccloskey  should be declared  the winner and  should be seated.  I don't happen to think that that is  right. I don't think it is right for many  reasons. In the short hour that I have,  I am not going to be able to go into all  those. I brought part of my file with  me, and I could just begin to pull doc uments out and read from those, but I  don't think  that would get  to  the  heart of  the matter. But  the main  reason I do not think it would be right  for this body to seat Mr. Mccloskey is  because, in fact, he has not won the  election. He has not won the election  because  the  lead  that he now has  come about through a set of circum stances and a set of recount procedures that are nowhere codified in the  law,  in  any  election  rules  in  this  United States of America.  How has he gotten to the point that  he has, as it .stands tonight, a four vote lead? First, they had to discount  the election, the original election on  November 6. The majority leader of  the body, the distinguished Congress man from my home State of Texas,  Mr. WRIGHT, said on January 3 that  they could not vote to seat Mr. Mcin tyre because the procedures involved  in his election had not been timely,  had not been regular, had not been  fair. We could pose the same question  this  evening. The  procedures  that  haye been involved in the latest re count in Indiana have not been timely,  they certainly have not been regular,  and they most certainly have not been  fair. So we ,have ,gotten to the point  where we have got to decide what to  do about this.  As one Member of this body,,! would  say that the thing that we should do  would be to move immediately to seat  the certified winner, which  is Mr.  Mcintyre, and then, if we really are se rious about this and want to conduct  an investigation, let us conduct an in vestigation. We have not conducted an  investigation yet. In the Federal re count  that  has  been  prematurely  ended, what we have done is s~t up an  entirely new procedure. But there was  no investigation of the original elec tion, and there was no investigation of  the recount. They came up with a new  set of procedures  and began  from  there. So let us seat Mr. Mcintyre to morrow, and then if we want to get to  the bottom of it, let us conduct the in vestigation.  That is not just my opinion. There  have been numerous editorials  that  relate to that. Some of the editorial  boards  in  this  country  that  have  stated Mr. Mcintyre should be seJ1,ted  are  the Wall Street Journal  three  times, the New York Times, the Wash ington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the  New  York  Post,  the Washington  Times, the Dallas Morning News, the  Houston Post, the Detroit News twice,  the Hpuston . Chronicle,  the Arizona  Republic, the Baltimore Sun, the Chi cago Sun Times, the Richmond Times  Dispatch,  the Denver Post. That  is  just a few. In the State of Indiana we  have  the  Indianapolis  Star,  the  Muncie Star, the Evansville Press, the  Madison Courier,  the Goshen News,  and the Franklin Daily J oumal. And  that is just a few. To my knowledge,  there has been no editorial support, at  most, maybe one newspaper..:....1 believe  a newspaper in Louisville came out  and said that perhaps Mr. Mccloskey  should be seated. I am not s'ijre aboU'.t  that, but I think that iS the only one.  So we have this vast range of opinion  stating that Mr. Mcintyre should be  seated .  .  '  .  l  .  ",1985

171,,99,0.541,233,7,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr. Speaker, Evelyn  Waugh wrote,  ""It  is  better  to be  narrow-minded than to have no mind,  to hold  limited and  rigid principles  than none at all. . . . There are still  things  which  are worth  fighting  against.""  For Alan Paton, author of the classic  ""Cry the Beloved Country,"" disinvest ment  is one of  those  things worth  fighting against. For those supporters  of disinvestment, both  liberals and  conservatives, both sincere and trendy  resume-builders, I am pleased to share  Alan Paton's nightmare as reprinted  in the Religion & Society Report of  February 1985.  ALAN PATON'S NIGHTMARE ABOUT SOUTH  AFRICAN DISINVESTMENT  Anglican bishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel  Peace Prize laureate, makes no secret of his  support for disinvestment. The idea of disinIn  has  vestment is that the withdrawal of U.S. cor porations and capital would bring effective  pressure to bear upon Pretoria and under mine the odious system of apartheid. The  disinvestment  campaign  in  recent  months gained momentum in this country,  erupting in Congress, state and municipal  governments, universities and, most success full, in some churches. Alan Paton, author  of the classic Cry the Beloved Country and  other writings against apartheid, thinks dis investment would be very bad for the Black  people of South Africa.  the Sunday  Times <Johannesburg> he politely took ex ception  to Bishop Tutu's views and was  roundly criticized by some readers, includ ing a Dr. Villa-Vicencio. We offer Alan  Paton's  response,  again  in  the Sunday  Times, not because it is necessarily the de finitive world on disinvestment, but because  it reflects considerations that may be  ig nored by activists here who, wanting to do  something about South Africa, may end up  doing anything, including things that grave ly  injure  the people  they want  to help.  Herewith Alan Paton's ""nightmare"":  ""I read that Dr. Villa-Vicencio, who has in  the past often thought I was right, thinks  now that I am wrong in passing moral Judg ment on those who advocate disinvestment.  He thinks I take a simplistic view of the  whole issue.  It seems that I have also misunderstood  the parable of the sheep and the goats. I un derstood Jesus to mean that if you denied a  hungry man food and a thirsty man drink  you were doing something very wrong.  I deduced from that parable, which I take  very seriously, that it would be wrong to ad vocate any course that would put a man out  of a Job.  To be simplistic is bad enough, but to fall  off one's pedestal makes it worse. One is  hurt, not only in one's body, but also  in  one's pride. There is only one sensible thing  to do in these circumstances, and that is to  go to bed. So I went to bed to sleep, per chance to dream ...  They came to see me,  these Americans,  full of righteousness. They flattered me too.  They told me my name was well known in  America, almost as well known as Gary  Player and Chris Barnard,  and now of  course Zola Budd and Bishop Tutu.  They told me the Americans had great re spect for my moral Judgments and that if I  came out for disinvestment, it would be a  certairi winner.  They asked me to become the president of  the World Disinvestment Campaign. They  also told me that if anyone was put out of a  Job, it wouldn't be me. I told them I had cer tain moral doubts, but they explained that I  was being simplistic.  One should bear in mind that Jesus was  talking about meat and drink, not about  Jobs. After much moral wrestling I accepted  the argument. No one can be more convinc ing than an American.  Also I must admit that I have some moral  weaknesses-one is vanity and the other is  money.  When  it was  announced, with a great  blowing of  trumpets,  that I had become  president of the World Disinvestment Cam paign, my life changed overnight.  Mr. Archimedes, who hadn't spoken to me  for years, came up to Botha's Hill to tell me  that I was now the hero of Africa. Professor  F sent me a telegram saying that I had at  last atoned for praising the Israelis for res cuing their hostages from the clutches of  IdiAmin.  Mr. R who had venerated me when he was  young and had ceased to venerate me when  8771  I said that PW was astute, telephoned to  say that he now venerated me again. Chief  B rang up in a fury and said that I had de stroyed a friendship of nearly 40 years and  that he would never speak to me again.  Cables of congratulations poured in from  America, Canada, Britain, Sweden and other  countries. Alas, I lost most of my capitalist  friends, but one must pay a price for taking  a stand.  I travelled all over the world. I was wel comed  on  campuses which would  have  shouted me down a year before. It was nice  to come in out of the cold.  Then came the great day. Representatives  of America, Canada, Britain, France, West  Germany, Holland and Scandinavian coun tries met in London and declared for total  disinvestment <except perhaps for a strate gic mineral or two>. Mrs. Archimedes came  up to tell me I was the hero of the whole  Black world.  Disinvestment began to bite. Port Eliza beth and East London became dead cities.  Even in a quiet place like Botha's Hill there  were daily Black queues for food and Jobs.  I must confess I didn't like passing them.  Many of the people of the Valley of a Thou sand Hills were my friends, but some grew  very cold to me.  It was a great shock to me to hear over  the radio that a mob had burned the build ings of  the Valley Foundation and  the  Church of the Paracelete to the ground.  I  telephoned the Rev John Ndlovu, and  told him that he had my prayers. He said to  me, we don't want your prayers, we want  Jobs.  Mr. Archimedes, who knows I often go to  the Church of the Paraclete, came up to  condole with me. He told me one must pay a  price for making a stand.  There is unrest in the Valley, in Botha's  Hill and Hillcreast and Kloof and Westville.  I find that I spend more and more time in  my study. I pull down the blinds. I find that  I feel better when the blinds are down.  But Julia comes to tell me that there are  Black women wanting to see me. She brings  their leader into my study, a tall woman for  these parts, a tall woman carrying a child  and dressed in black.  She looks like a sculpture of the Sorrow of  the World. She gives me the child and I see  it is dead.  '-Why do you give this to me?'  'Because it is yours.'  '-How can it be mine? I have never seen  you before.'  'You took its life, therefore it is yours.'  She goes out of the study and calls to me.  She points to the waiting women.  '-They will bring you their children too.'  When  the police have  taken away  the  body of the child I come to a decision. I get  into my car, my new bullet-proof car, and I  drive  to Pinetown and I buy something I  have never bought before. It is a gun.  I go home and go into my study with the  drawn blinds. There, surrounded by all the  hundreds of books and papers that I wrote  for the World Disinvestment Campaign, I  shoot myself to death.  How could I do such a thing? How could I  bring such a noble life to such an ignoble  end? How could I commit such a deadly sin?  I am filled with an agony of remorse. The  burden of it is intolerable. I wish only to die.  But ... what am I talking about? Am I  not dead already? No I am not! The whole  thing is an unspeakable dream. I am full of  Joy to realise that I never had anything to  do with any campaign for disinvestment.  ",1985
172,,99,0.262,246,7,Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  I  introduced  legisla tion, titled the Student Loan Collec tion  Improvement Amendments  of  1985. The purpose of this legislation is  to reduce defaults and improve collec tions within the National Direct Stu dent Loan CNDSLl  and Guaranteed  Student Loan CGSLl Programs, au thorized under the Higher Education  Act.  Over the past 20 years, the NDSL  and GSL Programs have provided bil lions of dollars in student loans, open ing the door to educational opportuni ty for millions of students. Most stu dent  borrowers  have  honored  the  terms of  their loans and have paid  them back in full or are currently in  active repayment.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  April 22, 1985  in  However,  the default  rate  the  NDSL Program currently stands at  14.9 percent with $1.044 billion in de faults. The GSL Program carries a de fault rate of 4.8 percent with $1.1 bil lion in defaults; $2.3 billion is a signifi cant sum. Every effort should be made  to recover  these funds and put the  money back where  it belongs-into  new student aid.  The Department of Education has  requested that statutory changes be  made to the Higher Education Act to  help  improve  the  collection  effort.  These changes would strengthen pro visions under current law to aid the  Department,  postsecondary  institu tions, and State guarantee agencies in  their collection efforts.  The bill I am introducing on behalf  of the administration would help im prove collection efforts in the follow ing ways:  First,  loan checks would .be made  payable to both the borrower and the  postsecondary  institution-except  in  cases of parent borrowers.  Second,  NDSL  defaults  would  become liable for a certain amount of  the costs borne by the Federal Gov ernment  in  trying  to collect on de faulted loans.  Third, State guarantee agencies  in  the GSL Program would be required  to report borrower default status in formation to consumer credit bureaus,  currently, the Department of Educa tion has this authority but the State  guarantee agencies now handle  the  bulk of student loans.  Fourth, responsibility for the collec tions of defaulted NDSL's would be  transferred from the postsecondary in stitution to the Department of Educa tion  instances where  institutions  have  a  consistently poor collection  record.  Fifth, the Federal statute of limita tions-6 years-would be applied  to  GSL and NDSL defaults and recover ies  of  overpayments  on other  aid  whenever  an  otherwise  prevailing  State statute provides a shorter time  on the student's liability.  Sixth,  eligibility  requirements  for  Federal student aid would be broad ened to provide that any student in de fault on a loan or owing a refund on a  grant would not be eligible for further  Federal aid. Current law applies this  limitation to students applying for aid  at an institution at which they are al ready in default or owe a refund, but  does not prevent students in default  from applying for aid at other schools.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor  this much-needed set of reforms to our  student loan programs. We are work ing to preserve Federal student aid.  However,  in  light  of  our  current  budget deficit and the severe funding  crisis educational programs are experi encing,  these programs cannot, and  should not, be abused. Please Join me  in helping to keep student aid both eq uitable and economic.e  in  DR. EDGAR NELSON HONORED  HON.

This  joyous ceremony will  take place on  April 28, 1985.  The  modern  Lemberg  Building  opened in 1982, and is an impressive  addition to the Central Queens YM/  YWHA  facilities.  To  commemorate  this occasion, the Y has commissioned  Joseph Dzindshkashvili,  the  famous  Soviet Georgian artist, sculptor, and  designer,  to design a unique plaque,  which will be permanently displayed  in the Lemberg Building.  Mr. Speaker, this occasion is a proud  one  for  the Central Queens YM/  YWHA  and  for  the entire Queens  County community, which  it serves.  The Hebrew Association's Center has  made a tremendous contribution to all  of us, and has enriched our lives  in  countless ways.  The Center draws neighbors, fami lies,  and  friends  together  through  many educational and athletic activi ties.  Its programs  reach out  to all  members of our community, concen trating on many of our special needs.  The YM/YWHA's after-school  day  care is designed to provide an atmos phere of safety, guidance, and love for  children whose  parents work  past  school hours. The lectures and recre ational activities for seniors at the Y  are an important part of the lives of  many elderly citizens interested in art,  current events, and  fellowship with  their peers and neighbors. In addition,  the facility sponsors a  summer day  camp for mentally disabled youngsters  that enables them to share in the fun  and relaxation of summer that all chil dren enjoy.  8797  Mr. Speaker,  the broad  range of  services and programs offered by the  Central Queens YM/YWHA, and its  special attention to the community's  real needs, have made an invaluable  contribution to the quality of life in  Queens County.  Today, when  career opportunities  cause many adults and  families  to  move away from their friends and rel atives, this Center in Central Queens  provides an especially valuable serv ice-by giving us a means to make new  friends, share the interests and activi ties of our neighbors, learn about our  community,  and  take  part  in  its  warmth and fellowship.  Mr. Speaker, I would  like to com mend the center's outstanding officers  for their dedication to enriching the  Queens community: President Jeffrey  S.

177,Senate,99,0.467,324,7,Mr. DENTON.," A  recent extended  visit by two Brigham Young Universi ty students to refugee camps in Costa  Rica and Honduras yielded similar re sults, which  they have publlshed.  I  shall ask unanimous consent that a  copy of their rePort also appear in the  RECORD at the conclusion of my re marks. Their interviews, however, also  provide  a  picture-not  so different  from that presented by the Permanent  Commission on Human Rights in Nica ragua-of Sandlnlsta human  rights  violations, which conflicts with  the  picture painted by Americas Watch  and by the Brody report, the latter  the  subject of  today's Wall Street  Journal article.  The Brody report is noteworthy be cause it was the brainchild of Reichler  and Applebaum, the law firm that rep resents  the Sandlnlsta  government  here in the United States, because its  authors were given material SUPPort  and transportation by the Sandlnlstas  during their stay in Nicaragua; and be cause  they admitted that local offi cials and health workers, more than  likely party members in good standing  or Sandlnlsta sympathizers, were a pri mary aid in helping to locate witnesses  to alleged Contra atrocities.  The result was a conclusion that the  Contras regularly and systematically  violate human rights. To date, I have  determined that at least three, per haps four, incidents mentioned in the  Brody  report were  not  accurately  characterized. The most blatant exam ple was the Brody report's description  of the December 1983 exodus of 2,000  Mlskltos to Honduras as a massive kld naping by MISURA, an Indian Contra  force. That event was widely reported  in the press, the American-born priests  who  voluntarlly  accompanied  the  flight asserted that the departure was  voluntary, and an independent  jour nalist who filmed  the entire exodus  says the Francia Slrpe residents were  packed and  ready  to go with  the  MISURA forces when they arrived.  I urge my colleagues to talk with  leaders or members of the Nicaraguan  armed resistance. I am convinced that  you wlll find them worthy of U.S. sup port and committed to ideals that are  similar to those found in our own Con stitution. The FDN, ARDE, MISURA,  and MISURASATA are not reaction ary organizations and are not engaged  in an effort to replace the Sandlnlsta  revolution with Somozismo.  Each fighter with the FDN ls given a  pocket-size ""Blue and White Book,""  which outlines  the principles UPon  which its struggle ls based. I quote for  a moment from that book:  Democracy ls the true power of the people  to elect and be elected. And it only exists  when periodic elections, free and universal  are practiced.

178,Senate,99,0.056,350,7,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr. President, this  debate represents, I believe, a classic  and historic collision between what  might be called short-term and long term foreign policy considerations. Un fortunately, in some respects it seems  as  though  the short-term consider ations are presently winning. I see the  policy dilemma revolving around the  following factors:  First, if we  judge the character of  the Nicaraguan revolution precipitate ly and formulate our policies on that  basis, are we going to be prepared to  bear the consequences later if we are  wrong now? Do we defer our historic  commitment  to  the sanctity of  the  rule of international law to sustain the  momentum of this policy, of which the  $14 million has become but a symbol?  Do we work from  the premise that  peace  is possible or that war,  in all  likelihood, is necessary?  If we render a  judgment now that  the Sandinistas are beyond the point  of no return, we invite a self-fulfilltng  prophecy.  If we convince ourselves and  the  American public that Nicaragua is in  fact a certifiable arm of the Soviet  Union's foreign policy apparatus and a  threat to vital U.S. interests, we had  better know exactly what we are talk ing about, because under that assump tion, if a military defeat of the Con tras becomes inevitable, our obligatory  response will also be inevitable.  What we do or do not do today af fects the unfolding caricature of the  Nicaraguan regime. Make no mistake  about  it. Our  responsibility  is  im mense, because the mark we make on  that caricature  through our actions  today will  go  far  in  determining  whether it will be necessary to send  American troops to war tomorrow. No  society could sustain, without paying a  price in judgment, the siege mentality  which  the Nicaraguan people have  been forced to bear under the present  circumstances-fighting a war against  a dictatorship one day, only to defend  themselves against attack the next.  Mr. President, there are many valid  arguments that point to danger in the  Sandanista  regime,  their  immense  military buildup being one of them.  And I concur in the viewpoint that we  should be concerned and act accord ingly. But I speak now only of the psy chological impact that uninterrupted  war has on a society and a people. We  may never have  the opportunity  to  help  the Nicaraguan people  if they  become so used to war that they are  rendered incapable of functioning any  other way.  To the extent that this caricat.ure of  a society is still unfolding, opportunities to change it which we fail to em brace, opportunities that are before us  today,  ready  to be  tested, virtually  guarantee that our most sinister suspi cions will be validated.  So everyone here who talks of a ""to talitarian Marxist  Leninist  Soviet  beachhead"" in Nicaragua had better  know exactly what he or she is talking  about, because if a majority of us are  convinced of that now and act accord ingly, we are going to have it, as sure  as we are going to have to stop it one  day in order to save face.  I am not saying people are right or  wrong on this assumption. I am only  saying that we had better be careful  before we  cross  that  xenophobic  threshold. We are all cynical to some  degree, and I suppose we have a right  to be. But there are untested opportu nities which exist right now-they are  out  there-opportunities which  are  not receiving the attention they de serve. We are not taking them serious ly and yet we have no idea whether  they deserve to be taken seriously or  not because we have not really ex plored the possibilities.  The Nicaraguan Government is talk ing today about lifting press censor ship. They are talking about amnesty.  They have already announced a quali tative  freeze on  the  importation of  arms.  I have no illusions, but I do have  fear,  fear  that we have become so  jaded already, liberal and conservative,  Democrat and Republican, so obsessed  with the symbolism and the question  of who will win and who will be the  victor and who will be the loser in this  situation that the political smoke will  clear tonight and those opportunities  for forward movement will have gone  up in smoke right along with it.  Finally,  the  Sandinistas may  at  times seem like petty thugs but we are  surely becoming world class outlaws  ourselves. And as long as we stand in  defiance of  the  jurisdiction of  the  International Court of Justice, and  the Charter of  the United Nations,  glaring omissions in this debate, we de serve what we get according to the law  of the jungle.  We have embraced the law of the  jungle to the disgrace of our ideals and  the delight of our enemies as a pre ferred method of operation.  Congress sent a clear message that it  will not finance the mining of harbors  but it has not made clear during this  important juncture in the formulation  of policy that the rule of the interna tional law is every bit as relevant to  determining  the parameters of our  policy as our refusal to tolerate an other Cuba in Central America.  When we boycott international juris prudence over the mining of a harbor  because the verdict is predictable, we  invite  the Ayatollah Khomeini  to  mine the Strait of Hormuz, and when  ",1985

As my colleagues  may know, I studied the Japanese lan guage and I majored in Asian studies  while in college, and I still maintain a  deep interest in the area.  I  know  from personal experience  that Japanese is a very difficult lan guage to learn. Yet we cannot expect  to succeed in Asian business, or learn  as much from the Japanese as they  learn from us, unless we improve our  language abilities. One useful step in  this direction is to translate more of  their  technical  literature and make  that information available to Ameri can companies. As we all know, Japan  no  longer simply  imitates American  science and technology. They are now  world-class researchers and innovators  in their own right. They study our lit erature and use that information to  improve their products. We must do  more to gain access to their literature.

181,Senate,99,-0.316,389,7,Mr. GORE.," Mr. President, I am of fering an amendment to this bill to  create a central repository for infor mation on structural failures in this  country.  Before my election to the Senate I  served  in the House of Representa tives as chairman of the Science and  Technology Subcommittee on Investi gations and Oversight. In that capac ity  I held several hearings on  the  problem of  structural  failures  and  building collapses around the country.  My colleagues may recall  the great  human suffering and economic  loss  that resulted from such catastrophes  as the collapse of the walkway at the  Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel in  1981 and the failure of the Hartford  Civic Center's roof in 1978.  One conclusion drawn  from  those  hearings is that there is a great need  for some sort of central data bank for  information  on  structural  failures.  Witness after witness  testified  that  many future structural failures could  be avoided if information on past fail ures was readily available. Although  the causes of failures are often investi gated by private parties  involved  in  them, much too frequently the previ ous  information  gathered  through  these investigations is kept in private  hands or even prevented from being  made public because of  settlement  agreements in lawsuits. The only in formation  that  is  available  to  the  public is not organized in a compre hensive fashion to maximize its utility.  As a result, many errors that led to  failures are repeated in other projects.  The purpose of my amendment is to  ensure that the data that is public is  organized in a readily accessible fash ion. Information that is gathered by  the National Bureau of Standards  through its investigations or which is  provided by private sources will be  compiled into one central repository.  Access to this information will enable  parties in the future to avoid the mis takes that have caused failures in the  past.  The program that my amendment  initiates is a very modest one in light  of the gravity of the problem it is de signed  to address. The amendment  simply creates a  technical assistance  function for the National Bureau of  Standards and is in no way intended to  establish a regulatory entity. I believe  that it is a good effort and will be of  ",1985
182,Senate,99,0.382,415,7,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I have  been honored to address this chamber  on numerous occasions on the issue of  abortion. When I have been fortunate  enough to have those opportunities, I  have attempted  to present my colleagues with the most compelling facts  and insights available to me on this  crucial topic. You have heard me ex press the view that abortion generally  is the immoral practice of terminating  the lives of innocent unborn babies,  and you have heard me suppart this  belief with facts. I have listened to my  colleagues  state  their positions  on  abortion as well. However, it is wise for  the Senate to hear opinions and view points of people who do not serve in  this body; indeed it pays us to listen to  those we represent.  In that spirit, Mr. President, I would  like to share with my colleagues here a  speech which was recently delivered  by Elder Russell M. Nelson, a member  of The Council of Twelve  of  the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints. I have found that the opinions  of members of the clergy are often  among  the  most  reasoned  and  thoughtful views that we can consider.  The thoughts with which our religious  leaders provide us are views which are  sufficiently  independent  from  the  heated debate of  the Senate. They  also off er us  the moral perspective  which we must keep  in mind even  when we address the most temporal  matters. Elder Nelson's remarks are no  exception to this. In his speech he lu cidly expresses the horrors of abortion  and refutes, both factually and ethi cally, the primary arguments abortion  advocates have relied on for years.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  in the Senate to read Elder Nelson's  address. After  they do so  they will  know many of the compelling reasons  why America must end abortion, a  practice which has cost 161h mllllon  lives since 1973 and which has denied  the  precious  gift  of  life  to  4,000  unborn babies since this time yester day.  The address follows:  RZVDDCJ: FOR Lin: GENERAL COIU'ERDCJ:,  APRIL 6, 1985  <Russell M. Nelson>  Unitedly, we thank the Almighty for the  wondrous prolongation of the life of Elder  Bruce R. McConkle, enabling him to preach  that Powerful sermon. Our gratitude Is pro found!  I pray for the Splrlt of the Lord to help  me communicate his mind and will on a very  vital and sensitive subject. I apologize for  the use of words repugnant to me and ill  suited to this hallowed pulpit. I do so only  for clarity of communication regarding rev erence for human life.  As sons and daughters of God, we cherish  life as a gift from him.  A heavy toll on life ts included among the  evils of war. Data from all nations are ap palllng. For the United States of America,  100,000 were killed in World War I. Over  400,000 died in World War II. In the first  200 years as a nation, the lives of over one  mlllion Americ&ns were lost due to war.  Regrettable as Is  the loss of loved ones  from war, these figures are dwarfed by the  toll of another war that annually claims  more casualties than the total number of fa talities from all the wars of this nation.  In  It Is a war on the defenseless-and the  voiceless. It Is a war on the unborn.  This war, labeled abortion, is of epidemic  proPortion and Is ,waged globally. Over 55  mlllion abortions were rePorted worldwide  in the year 1974 alone.1 Sixty-four percent  of the world's PoPulation now live in soci eties that legally sanction this practice.   the United States of America, over 1.5 mil lion  abortions  are  performed  annually.a  About 30 percent of all pregnancies now end  in abortion.   In some metroPolitan areas,  there are more abortions performed than  live births.1 Comparable data also come  from other nations.  Yet society professes reverence for human  life. We weep for those who die, pray and  work for those whose lives are in Jeopardy.  For years, I have labored with other doctors  here and abroad, struggling to prolong life.  It Is Impossible to describe the grief a physi cian feels when the life of a patient is lost.  Can anyone lmaglne how we feel when life  Is destroyed at its rooU;, as though it were a  thing of naught?  What sense of  inconsistency can allow  people to grieve for their dead, yet be cal loused to this baleful war being waged on  life at the time of its silent development?  What logic would encouage efforts to pre serve the life of a critically ill 12-week-old  infant, but countenance the termination of  another life 12 weeks after inception? More  attention Is seemingly focused on the fate of  a life at some penitentiary's death row than  on the mlllions totally deprived of life's OP Portunity  through  such  odious  carnage  before birth.  The Lord has  repeatedly declared  this  devlne Imperative: ""Thou shalt. not kill."" 1  Recently he added, ""nor do anything like  unto it"" <D&C 59:6>.  Even before the fullness of the gospel was  restored,  the enlightened understood  the  sanctity of life. John Calvin, 16th century  reformer, wrote:  ""If it seems more disgraceful that a man  be killed in his own home than in his field since for every man his home Is his sanctu ary-how much more abominable Is it ... to  kill  a  fetus  . . . who has not yet been  brought into the light. 7""  But what Impropriety could now legalize  that which has been forbidden by the laws  of God from the dawn of time? What twist ed reasoning has transformed mythical con cepts into contorted slogans assenting to a  practice which Is consummately wrong?  These slogans begin with proper concern  for the health of the mother. Infrequently,  instances may occur in which the continu ation of pregnancy could be life-threatening  to the mother. When deemed by competent  medical authorities that the life of one must  be terminated in order to save the life of the  other, many agree that it ts better to spare  the mother. But these circumstances are  rare, particularly where modem medical  care Is available.  1 C. Tietze,  Induced Abortion: A World Review,  1981, note 30 at 19, 1981.

We can argue the numbers of people  who are in the positions of power back  and forth, both on the political side  and on the military side. The fact of  the matter is that we see atrocities.  These have not been, as the gentle man suggested, by patronizing Ameri can citizens who tried to go down and  to develop  the facts for  themselves,  but by independent organizations that  have found atrocities on both sides;  American Watch and other organiza tions.

188,House,99,-0.172,493,7,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  propose a compromise, whether it be  on this floor at a later time or whether  it come from the other body. The com promise I offer is as follows:  First, keeping  the Boland amend ment.  Second, providing $14 million in hu manitarian aid to the Contras to be  split evenly or otherwise between the  International Red Cro8s and U.S. Gov ernment channels, preferably through  AID.  Third,  cleaning  up  the Contras,  which means eliminating former So mosistas and developing a positive po litical program which would include a  type of Bill of Rights and humanitari an reforms.  Let me explain in more detail.  First, there is a political requirement  for keeping the Boland amendment.  Most Americans believe it wrong to be  involved in efforts to overthrow a gov ernment with which we have diplo matic relations.  Second, by splitting the humanitari an aid request between the Interna tional Red Cross and the U.S. Govern ment, the United States would be un derscoring its concern for the legiti mate needs of refugees who have fled  Nicaragua and who are now living in  Costa Rica and Honduras. Money for  the Contras would be stretched out  over 18 months, once again for hu manitarian purposes to aid Nicaraguan  refugees but tied to efforts to put to gether a program to clean out former  Somosistas and establish a liberal, in  the classic sense, democratic program.  And third, I stress the importance of  transforming the Contras into a legiti mate alternative to the present gov ernment. We have to change the per ceptions of the American public and  international opinion toward the Con tras. This means that we have to sup port Arturo Cruz in the Nicaraguan  situation in much the same way we  supported Napoleon Duarte in El Sal vador.  Just a few years ago the situation in  El Salvador was pretty grim-death  squads on the right and Communist  guerrillas on the left. Democratic lib erals in Congress helped change the  situation by  strengthening Duarte's  hand. President Duarte, a true demo crat, was able to convince the military  that without a curb in death squad ac tivity the change of continued U.S. aid  were slight. Progress has been made in  El Salvador against both the extreme  left and right.  In the Nicaraguan situation, Arturo  Cruz is the same kind of individual as  Napoleon Duarte. He fought against  Somoza, and was arrested on two dif ferent occasions. He also served as a  member of the present Sandinista gov ernment until he reluctantly came to  the conclusion that they had no inten tion of honoring promises made to the  OAS in 1979. He is a respected politi cal leader and a true democrat. He and  others like him are the kind of individ uals whom we need to support and  who deserve our support.  As part of the effort to make the  Contras a truly legitimate alternative,  they need to put together a positive  political program. Such a  program  should include: an explanation of the  proposed economic structure with a  detailed account of positions on land  reform, market guarantees, business  safeguards; a commitment to a plural istic political system; guarantees en suring that the military would be con trolled; policies concerning  taxation,  education,  freedom of speech, press,  and religion. The program should also  openly accept gains made by the San dinistas  in health and education. It  should reject the Sandinista authori tarian  apparatus:  neighborhood  de fense committees, mass control organi zations, and ideologically oriented edu cation.  As part of this process toward legiti mizing the Contras the effort should  be made to open up the movement to  international  organizations-Red  Cross, Amnesty International-church  groups, and news media observes  in  order to secure the kind of interna tional acclaim and support attained by  the Sandinistas in 1978-79.  This is how we should proceed.  ",1985

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to sup port the resumption of United States  assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels  in Nicaragua. The social,  economic,  and political problems that continue  to plague Nicaragua and to promote  tragic violence  there concern us all,  and it is because of that concern that I  urge my colleagues to lift their prohi bitions on aid to the Contras and allow  the United States to once again sup port those who are fighting for peace  and democracy in the region.

191,House,99,-0.27,532,7,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," Mr.  Chairman, today the House begins de liberations on whether or not to re lease $14 million in military aid to the  Contras in Nicaragua.  Today we can help decide whether  the conflict between the Contras and  Sandinistas continues, o:r. whether the  United States takes a more construc tive role in seeking a negotiated peace  in the region.  Today we can take a step closer to  achieving the goal of political and eco nomic stability in Nicaragua by send ing a signal to those countries partici pating in the Contadora peace process,  that this government does not want to  contribute to the continuing military  escalation in the region and that we  would like to make a positive contribu tion to the Contadora process.  Our covert military involvement in  Nicaragua so far has been a violation  of  international  law, morally  repre hensible, and contrary to the best in terests of the United States in this  hemisphere.  I agree with the administration that  we should support democratic changes  and institutions in Nicaragua, just as  we should support democratic changes  in Chile and South Africa. However, I  disagree on the means of achieving  those democratic goals.  The alternative to a foreign policy  which emphasizes military might  is  one which achieves peace through ne ~otiations-negotiations with the San dinista Government and its neighbors.  I urge my colleagues to resist the ad ministration's public  relations  cam paign and oppose the continuation of  funding for the Contras.e  e ",1985
192,House,99,-0.342,532,7,Mr. MAVROULES.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in opposition  to  the  resolution  before us today that would make avail able $14 million in military aid to the  rebels in Nicaragua. No matter how it  comes, military aid to the Contras in  Nicaragua  is unacceptable policy for  the United States.  The administration has cried woll on  this issue too many times. I would like  to ask this administration, ""Where is  the evidence  to support your argu ments?""  First,  the  administration  sounded  the alarm when it suspected that the  Soviet Union was shipping Mig-21 air craft to Central America. But, the ad ministration  has  no  evidence  that  those crates ever left the Soviet docks.  Where are these Mig-21 aircraft?  Then, last year, the administration  accused the Sandinistas of exporting  large quantities of arms into El Salva dor. But, the administration has yet to  come  to Congress with evidence  to  support this claim. Where are those  shipments of arms?  And, this year, to defend this very  resolution, the administration claimed  the aid would be used as bargaining le verage  in negotiations between  the  Contras  and  the Sandinistas. But,  where are the negotiations?  And, more recently, the administra tion claims it has the support of Costa  Rica and Colombia. But, where are  those words of support from President  Monge and President Betancur?  Finally,  the administration claims  that only one-third of the Contra com mand structure is former Somoza Na tional Guardsmen. The Arms Control  and Foreign Policy Caucus not only  claims that 46 out of 48 Contra leaders  are Somoza heirs, but  also  names  them. Where are the names that sup port the administration's claims?  There are just too many inconsisten cies  in  the administration's Central  American policy.  All Americans want to see an end to  the violence in Central America and  the  restoration of  stability  in  the  region. We want to be able to offer the  people of Central America an alterna tive  to  totalitarian  and  dictatorial  leadership, as well as an alternative to  further military conflict. Basic liber ties  and human  rights only mean  something if they can be exercized in  peace.  The Contra war against the Sandi nista regime  in Nicaragua does not  contribute  to  stability  in Central  America.  It contributes  to  neither  peace nor democracy.  A vote against this resolution is not  a vote for communism. It ls a vote  against a military solution to the prob lems in Central America. It ls a vote  that rejects the administration's mili tary priorities.  Later on, we will have an opportuni ty to off er the people of Nicaragua  and Central America a peaceful alter native. A constructive policy in Cen tral America means support for  the  Contadora process. And economic de velopment aid that will solve the in digenous economic problems  in Cen tral America that lead to political in stability.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this  resolution.  Thankyou.e  of California. Mr.  Chairman, it ls time that the United  States stopped trying to singlehandede Mr. BROWN  ly change the Government in Nicara gua through military intervention. We  have learned from past experiences in  Vietnam and elsewhere that this is not  often a successful policy, and is one  which requires tremendous American  resources:  a  tremendous amount of  money and an unacceptable  loss of  lives.  Aid to the Contras has been one of  the most debated policies in Congress.  We have thoroughly discussed the ill  effects of our current policies,  the  ""perceived"" Communist threat of the  Sandinista government to the United  States, as well as the need for some  form of pressure on the Sandinista  government  to  improve  its human  rights record and to limit its power to  extend revolution to other countries.  What we have  learned  from  this  debate is that the situation is not as  black and white as the President por trays it. We have seen further that the  President's military aid to the Contras  has proved to be neither a popular,  nor a very effective policy.  We have seen that military aid to  the Contras has not accomplished our  goals. Nor can we realistically expect a  limited amount of military aid to be  instrumental in the overthrow of the  Sandinista government. Even  if  this  somewhat dubious goal were achieved,  what guarantee would we have that  the new regime would be more demo cratic, that it would be more consis tant with American interests, or even  that it would hold the support of the  Nicaraguan people?'  Revolution  is not new  to Central  America, nor will it go away through  military force. The problems leading  to political instability in Nicaragua, as  well as in all of Central America, re sults mainly from poor living condi tions. The area ls plagued by unem ployment,  inflation, poverty, hunger,  illiteracy,  disease,  and  declining  growth and  investment. In order to  find  long-term solutions  regional  and  local unrest, we must address  these sources of political instability as  well.  Our military pressure on the Sandi nistas,  by  supporting  the Contras,  simply  justifies the militarization of  Nicaragua and  the oppressive meas ures taken by the Sandinista regime.  The  threat  of  the  ""Imperialistic  Yankee""  from  the north gives  the  Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega a col losal enemy to rally his forces against,  and helps him  to generate popular  support.  In addition, our unilateral military  approach hurts U.S. credibility in the  international  community,  especially  when the legality of our policy is at  best, questionable. Our policy of sup porting the terrorist activities of the  Contras underscores the international  perception of the United States as an  aggressive bully pursuing its own intO  .  f  ",1985

I want to commend and call to the  attention of the American people and  the retailing community an effort by a  major department store chain to keep  Americans at work.  Sunday s Washington Post profiled  the Wal-Mart Stores' ""Buy America""  program whereby the 753-store chain  is making a determined effort to buy  products that are made in the United  States. instead of abroad.  In the words of company officials.  the effort is to prove that American  manufacturers can produce the qual ity of goods at prices comparable to  imported goods.  There are many Wal-Mart stores in  my congressional district in Texas and  I believe consumers who are aware of  our serious imbalance in trade will be  aware buying at these stores will be re storing or saving jobs of their fellow  Americans.  The Bentonville, AR  firm which  bought about 5 percent of  its mer chandise last year from foreign manu facturers, want to reduce that to 4 per cent this year and even lower percent ages in future years.  I am hopeful the chief executive of ficers of other retail chains will follow  the lead of Wal-Mart Chairman Sam  Walton.  I want to share the Post article with  you and I wish Wal-Mart much success  in their efforts.  [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 19851  WAL-MART  FLYS  THE  FLAG  IN  IMPORT  BATTLE-PRODS U.S. PRODUCERS WITH FA VORABLE TERK8  <By Caroline E. Mayer)  Late last year, Sam Walton, the chairman  of Wal-Mart Stores Inc .  gave his merchan dise buyers an order: Think. of a product  that American manufacturers have given up  on because of competition from cheaper im ports.  An apparel buyer suggested inexpensive  flannel shirts, virtually all of which are now  made outside the United States.  Today. the 753-store discount chain has a  $600,000 contract with a  small Brinkley,  Ark., manufacturer  for  240,000  flannel  shirts-one-tenth of what the company an ticipates it will sell next winter.  ""We've set out to prove that American  manufacturers can make merchandise we  sell on a competitive basis with the same  quality and value as products made over seas,"" said David D. Glass, president of Wal Mart, one of the nation's fastest-growing  and most successful discount chains, second  to K mart Corp. in size.  ""As a company, we are tremendously con cerned with the trade deficit"" Glass said.  ""We see a tremendous erosion of manufac turing jobs in this country as manufacturers  accelerate the movement to go offshore to  make their goods. None of us will believe    I  9109  what this country will be like five  to 10  years from now if we continue to let this  happen.""  Between 1981 and 1984, an estimated 1.6  mllllon American jobs were lost to imports,  Walton recently pointed out in a letter to  his suppliers. ""In one year Cl983 to 19841,  non-oil-related imports grew $70 bllllon, an  increase of 33 percent. The trade deficit  reached $123.3 bllllon, an increase of 78 per cent. Something can and must be done to re verse this very serious threat to our free en terprise system and our great country;  he  wrote.  Now Walton wants to try to turn the tide.  Last month the company officially launched  a novel and ambitious Buy-American cam paign to prod domestic manufacturers to  produce more goods at home. Last year the  company purchased about 5 percent of its  goods  from  foreign manufacturers. This  year, Walton said he hopes to reduce that to  4 percent through his campaign, with fur ther reductions in the years ahead.  By offering unusual favorable terms-in cluding longer lead times and more advanta geous  financial  agreements-Wal-Mart  hopes to prove that American manufactur ers can make quality products  that will  match or beat the prices of imported goods.  ""We are willing to work with the domestic  manufacturers to a greater extent than we  have done before,"" Glass said.  Also, Wal-Mart is willing to lower its mar gins to sell the goods at a competitive price,  Walton said. ""We are asking our manufac turers to lower their margins; in turn, we  will lower ours.''  However, Walton contended that profit ability for the company-which earned $240  mllllon  last year on sales of $6 bllllon should  improve because  force  the  company to make better buys. Perhaps even  more significantly,  the campaign will be  promoted  in Wal-Mart's stores,  creating  more ""enthusiastic and appreciative custom ers:  Walton noted.  The contract for flannel shirts with Farris  Fashions Inc. is the first test of Wal-Mart s  resolve.  To help Farris Fashions Inc. be price-com petitive, Wal-Mart has helped locate and fi nance the fiannel material it needed to meet  the contract. ""Without Wal-Mart's help, I  would have given up on the project long  ago,"" noted Farris' president, Farris Bur roughs. ""I kept beating my head to find  piece goods and financing:' he said, noting  that he had called every textile manufactur er he knew. unsuccessfully looking for mate rial. mttmately, Wal-Mart called manufac turers to find goods and promised favorable  financing terms for the goods to help Farris  get a start.  Additionally, Wal-Mart ""has agreed to pay  us a little quicker than normai:  Burroughs  said.  ""If I didn t  have that work, I'd be hard  pressed to keep my 100 employees busy:   said Burroughs. ""Without that contract. I'd  be out beating the bushes. And with busi ness now very slow in the shirt and blouse  business, those bushes are almost all beat  out.''  Wal-Mart didn't have to make these ar rangements. Burroughs said.  ""People are  beating down Wal-Mart's doors to sell them  goods,"" he asserted. ""All Mr. Walton has to  do is to say 'give me so many dozen.' He  doesn't need  to worry about"" where his  goods are being manufactured.  Yet he said Walton does have a direct in terest in the import problem: A lot of the  Americans who are losing jobs as a result of  it will  .  ",1985

197,Senate,99,-0.301,610,7,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this is Professional Secretaries Week.  Last year at this time, I  took to the  floor to pay tribute to the secretaries  in my office. Since that time, much  has changed. Vicki Baer, who was then  and  remains my personal s~cretary,  has married, and we all now know and  love her as Vicki Dodson. Her hus band, Rick Dodson, is a lighting tech nician for NBC News. He n;iay be seen  frequently in the halls of the Capitol,  and occasionally about my office, visit ing his dear bride on a spare moment.  Another welcome change is the im provement  in  the health of Kelley  Prunesti. We are glad to have her back  this year.  One other notable turn is the addi tion of Ms. Mary Stealey to the staff.  Mary replaced Fran Cochran, who has  joined  the ranks of the happily re tired.

199,Senate,99,-0.033,649,7,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, an  unswerving champion of ,civil  rights  and  of  a  decent  home  and  basic  human services for  those of limited  means has passed from our midst.  Patricia Roberts Harris, who died  March  23,  had  a  long  and distin guished career as a dedicated public  servant.  Among the public posts to which Pat  Harris brought grace, dignity, and a  conviction of purpose were delegate to  the United Nations; Ambassador  to  Luxembourg;  Secretary  of Housing  and Urban Development; and Secre tary of Health and Human Services.  She carried out her duties in each of  these positions with versatility and a  quick command of the situation.  At no time, however, did she allow  the power or prestige of these high  public offices to go to her head. Pat  Harris was well aware of and never  forgot her roots as the daughter of a  Chicago pullman car porter. Her expe riences as a black woman and her sen sitivity to the needs of black and other  minority Americans during, not only  times of segregation, but also times of  more subtle and sophisticated discrim ination, were  always with her and  never forgotten. She translated that  sensitivity into a sense of purpose to  right the wrongs of our society. She  constantly challenged us to do better.  I had the good fortune to work close ly with Pat Harris when she served as  Secretary of Housing and Urban De velopment from 1977 to 1979. As the  ranking member of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on HUD and Independ ent Agencies, I was impressed by her  command of the facts and her single mindedness  of  purpose  to  provide  housing for those of low and moderate  income.  In 1977, Secretary Harris came to me  and asked me  to  introduce amend ments  to  the Fair Housing Act  to  strengthen HUD's enforcement role in  conciliating between the parties in in dividual housing discrimination com plaints. I was proud to introduce the  legislation  which,  after  numerous  hearings and markups, was passed by  more than a two-thirds bipartisan ma jority in the House but failed by fili buster to pass the Senate.  Pat Harris did not mince words.  When she saw a wrong to be corrected  she went at it relentlessly, bringing  her acumen in the law to bear.  For example,  in  testimony before  the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on  the Constitution, in response to a Sen ator skeptical of the fair housing bill,  who  feared  it  represented Federal  Government oppression of property  owners, Secretary Harris had this to  say:  I think that objectively, as one examines  the history of this country and especially  the history of housing discrimination, ef forts to bring equality to the one area that I  know about that is consistently refused, the  offer of money by persons who are black, is  not oppressive.  It is an effort to bring equality to the mar ketplace of housing and I cannot agree that  an effort, a genuine, concerned effort  to  bring equality to an area which is clearly  fraught within equality today, is an exam ple of Federal oppression.  It is an example of the implementation of  the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments.  And before the counterpart House  Judiciary Subcommittee, she got right  to the heart of the matter:  Our present authority  is  limited  to a  purely voluntary process of ""conference,  conciliation,  and persuasion.""  I will not  dwell on the ironies associated with a law  that mandates HUD to investigate and to  establish the existence of violations of law,  and then limits the Secretary to asking the  discovered lawbreaker whether he wants to  discuss the matter.  And again, in 1979, before the same  House  Subcommittee,  Secretary  Harris challenged the Congress to act  on a fair housing bill with these words:  Let me say that there are so many conse quences of our falling to solve our housing  problem  in  this country,  that failure  to  make a major effort now, with sufficient en forcement powers, may  lead us  to racial  problems in the generation of the grandchil dren of, certainly, not mine but of my rela tives. We must have the ability in our life times or in the foreseeable futur~ to bring  this commodity of shelter within the pur view of people who are able to purchase it.

200,House,99,-0.127,662,7,Mr. ROWLAND of Georgia.," Mr.  Speaker,  yesterday  in Albany, NY,  some 5,000 physicians out of 40,000  physicians in that State gathered at  the State capitol to focus attention on  the malpractice  insurance premium  problem that we are experiencing in  our country today.  .  To me, that is really impressionable  that this many physicians would have  taken time away from their practice to  focus attention on such a severe prob lem that we now have.  Mr. Speaker, the practice of medi cine is not an exact science. Any proce dure that is undertaken has some ele ment of risk; any treatment that is  prescribed has some element of risk.  Physicians are beginning to view each  case, each illness that they have ~ a  potential malpractice suit.  It is thought by many now that it  may contribute as much as $15 to $40  billion to the increase in cost of medi cal care  in our country, and in my  State alone, it is estimated that it may  add as much as $3 billion.  The quality of care is now being af fected to some extent because there  are many physicians who are practic ing obstetrics that are beginning  to  drop out of that practice simply for  the reason of the threat of malprac tice.  How long are we going to continue  to ignore this growing threat that is  going  to undermine  the quality of  medical care in our country?  0 1250  ARMENIANS DAY  <Mr. DORNAN of California asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.>  ",1985
201,House,99,-0.084,662,7,Mr. VALENTINE.," Mr.  Speaker,  today we mourn the death of a great  North Carolinian and statesman, Senator Sam B. Ervin, Jr.  Sam Ervin was a World War I hero,  Harvard Law School graduate, judge,  and U.S. Senator. He served the 10th  District of North Carolina in the U.S.  House  of Representatives,  1946-47,  before he was appointed to the North  Carolina  Supreme  Court. Yet  he  chose, Mr. Speaker, to refer to himself  as ""just a country lawyer from North  Carolina."" He considered the Constitu tion a sacred scripture and he spent  his whole life defending it.  His passion for truth, for civil liber ties,  the many freedoms  that we at  times take for granted yet he so dearly  believed in, transcended all races. reli gions, creeds or economic status as he  fought for the protection of all human  beings under the law.  He was a national symbol of dignity  and integrity in politics. He embodied  a wisdom and wealth of knowledge,  from his down home country stories to  his quotations from Shakespeare, that  was Unsurpassed in American politics.  He was  truly a national hero who  bridged both the 19th and 20th cen turies  as  he  carried  our Nation  through the dark hours of the Water gate affair. Through his unyielding  search for truth, he helped to diffuse  one of' the most devastating events in  American politics.  As Senator Ervin said at the Water gate hearings some 12 years ago,  in  words which bear repeating today:  And I think that those who participated  in this effort to nullify the laws of man and  the laws of God overlooked one of the laws  of God, which is set forth in the 7th verse of  the 6th chapter of Galatians:  Be not deceived. God is not mocked; for  whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also  reap.  Our Nation has been enriched and  made stronger by all that Senator Sam  was and believed in. He will be sorely  missed.

202,House,99,-0.237,675,7,Mr. FOWLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  regret that my colleague from Wyo ming, Mr. CHENEY, refused to yield for  debate, for what he said deserves to be  answered.  The speech that he read has been  read  in  this Chamber by him and  others many times before. Only the  name of this year's country has been  substituted.  A few years ago I heard the same  speech read by similar spokesmen for  this administration when we were sup porting  a  government  in Ethiopia  against Marxists, as they called them selves, in Somolia. After pursuing this  policy-thought to be in the best inter est of the United States-for a while  we found that events change and now  ironically we are supporting the Somo lians even though Mr. Barre calls him self a Marxist, against  the Commu nists in Ethiopia.  D 1400  I remember when that speech was  read a few years ago by administration  spokesmen about Albania, which was  first a Soviet satellite, second, a Chi nese Communist satellite, and is now  some form of xenophobic nationalism,  I guess, which our country embraces.  I remember when that speech was  read by administration spokesmen in  this body about Algeria,  a  country  that we condemned as Communist, but  to which we are now providing arms  and understanding.  I remember when that speech was  read about the Sudan and Zimbabwe  and Marxist Mozambique, but have  now changed our policies. I remember  too well  the accusations heard here  today. that there is no reconciliation,  no  negotiation  possible;  that  we  cannot find a way to solve our prob lems, eliminate hostile influences, and  to support  the forces of democracy  short of waging war.  I urge my colleagues to put the prob lem of Central America in that per spective  of  recent  history. Central  America  is  important  to  the United  to  States. It is not at this moment vital  to the United States.  But the United States is vital to the  freedom and economic development of  Central America. We can sustain a  better course; 40 Republicans along  with 40 Democrats last night said a  military solution is not the only solu tion and not a bipartisan solution.  The  amendment  offered  by Mr.  BARNES today is first step in achieving  a  sustainable U.S.  foreign policy  in  minimizing hostile influences in Cen tral America. I hope you will support  it.

205,House,99,0.378,688,7,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Chair man, Hamilton-Barnes says that the  United States should provide only hu manitarian aid and that this should be  channeled  through  the U.N. High  Commissioner  on Refugees  or  the  International Red Cross,  and  then  only if they should decide to do it to  meet humanitarian needs. These are  respectable organizations, but  there  are respectable U.S. Government orga nizations capable of doing that, too. In  addition,  there are reasons why  the  proposed recipients might not be re ceptive  to  the  two  organizations  named in the amendment.  People familiar with the plight of  those who have fled Sandinista rule  and familiar with the activities of the  UNHCR say this would be a sure way  to weaken and dishearten the regime's  opponents.  Personal testimony comes from Dr.  Othniel J. Seiden, a Denver physician  who spent 3 weeks in Honduras close  to the Nicaraguan border caring for  Miskito Indian victims of the Sandi nista regime. Dr. Seiden was a volun teer sponsored by  the Victoria and  Albert Gildred Foundation for Latin  American Health and Education.  At first he thought he'd work in the  UNHCR refugee camps. But Miskito  leaders in Honduras persuaded him to  come to their own villages where there  were thousands of Nicaraguan Miskito  refugees who desperately needed med ical  care. The Miskito  leaders  ex plained  that  the UNHCR medical  teams refused to go to the villages but  insisted  the  refugees  come  to  the  UNHCR camps. This most of the Indi ans refused to do.  According to Dr. Seiden, the Miskito  refugees  claimed  they were much  better off in the villages of their own  people than in the UNHCR camps.  Working in the villages and in visits  to UNHCR camps, Dr. Seiden found  that all the Miskito leaders said was  true.

206,House,99,0.314,701,7,Mr. KASICH.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, several weeks ago I  stood on this floor and argued that  America is a good, decent, Just nation.  I said we ought to, as Americans, shed  the guilt that too many Members of  Congress carry on this floor. I said the  ""Blame  America  First""  crowd  is  wrong. I said that we are a good, just,  and decent people and stood on the  high-moral ground and argued  that  the tradition of this country has been  to go to the ends of the Earth to help  people  in need. Whether  they are  hungry. whether  they are  sick,  or  whether they are victims of natural or  manmade disasters, our legacy  is  to  help.  Why do we do it? We do it because  we are good. We do  it to provide a  decent way of life for human beings,  to give them a chance to control their  own lives, to control their own destiny,  to secure them from the Jaws of death  and,  yes,  ladies  and gentleman,  to  secure them from the Jaws of repres sion.  Yes, I made this statement, if you  will recall, as this House voted $1 bil lion in aid to Africa, including aid to  Communist Ethiopia, whose  leaders  have aggravated the problems in their  nation, whose leaders are more inter ested in relocation and more interest ed in resettlement and in consolidating  their power than in feeding starving  people.  In  fact, Communist  leaders  have used trucks that could have car ried grain to starving people to relo cate resisters to their regime in north ern Ethiopia. These  are  the  same  Communist leaders who spent $10 mil lion celebrating the Marxist revolution  while America watched with horror  the tragedy of starving millions who  desperately needed that $10 million in  foodstuffs.  This body has approved aid to Com munist Angola. This body has  ap proved aid to Communist China. This  body has approved aid to Communist  Mozambique and, of course, this body,  believe it or not, has approved in the  past $118 million in aid to the Sandi nistas, until even Jimmy Carter, Amer ica's leading Democrat ostrich, recog nized the repression and called for a  halt.  Is it too much to provide $14 million  in  humanitarian  aid  to  freedom  fighers, people who want to determine  their own destiny, people who want  freedom of the press, people who want  freedom of speech and freedom of reli gion,  like  the Moskito  Indians, who  are willing to fight and die for free dom?

The substitute  will make us the quartermaster corps  of the Nicaraguan Contras.   The first resolution, just passed, pro vides true refugees with true humani tarian assistance. The substitute gives  the Contras boots, rations, and other  military  assistance-everything  an  army needs save for weapons. They  can  get  those  elsewhere with  the  money they save.  The argument  that somehow our  Nation will have  ""clean hands"" by  giving Contras only the so-called hu manitarian aid just won't wash. The  bottom line is still military support whether you are  the quartermaster  corps or the ordnance corps.  What sort of humanitarian aid can  we expect from  this administration?  With its track record, you will see hu manitarian aid that includes helicop ters outfitted for the medical evacu ation of soldiers. Never mind that the  helicopters may  be  outfitted with  rocket pods purchased from another  source. When  the press  reports on  such actions appear, you can be sure  that the administration will shrug its  shoulders and say, ""We have no con trol over what they do.""

209,House,99,0.013,714,7,Mr. SHELBY.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  today's debate has once again high lighted the problems endemic to this  body's exploratory process-a process  which often leads us to be too preoccu pied with  the ""how,"" ""where,"" and  ""what"" rather than the ""why."" This is  understandable. It is easy to focus at tention  on  Contra  human  rights  abuses. It is far more difficult to dwell  on the systemic oppression which has  come  to permeate Nicaraguan socie ty-an oppression which has provided  the  fertile ground from which  the  Contras have spawned.  The Sandinistas have betrayed their  own revolution. They have betrayed  their supporters at home. They have  betrayed  their  supporters  abroad.  Most of all, they have betrayed them selves.  The Sandinista dictatorship is a to talitarian state, and it has done what  all totalitarian states do: it has stifled  both democracy and those who so ably  uphold  its  values-the  press,  the  church, and ultimately the voters.  There are those who say this isn't  America's problem. Why  should  it  matter if Nicaragua is a  totalitarian  state? Well,  this seems  to beg  the  question. Free elections, I've been told,  are a  rare commodity in totalitarian  states. Dissent is a precarious occupa tion. Ask Mr. Castro's political oppo nents what they 'think about Cuban  political debate.  Mr. Chairman, democratic states do  not attack their neighbors. Democratic  states do not readily carry out war.  Democratic states, as we well know,  are reluctant to spend a great deal of  money on arms. In short, democratic  states are not, nor will they ever be a  threat to the free world.  The Contras are not angels. There  are certainly objectionable elements  among  their ranks. But as Winston  Churchill once said: ""Democracy is the  worst system in the world except for  all of  the others."" For all of  their  faults, the Contras are far preferable  to the alternative-the alternative of  millions of ""foot people"" fleeing possi ble  totalitarian  states  in  Central  America,  the alternative of our bor ders  being overrun  by millions  of  hungry refugees who only desire  to  live in peace, and the alternative of  Soviets satellite governments  sitting  astride the Rio Grande.  Closing our eyes and wishing  the  threat away may temporarily work in  Afghanistan, but to abrogate our duty  here  in our own backyard does not  bode well for the future of a nation  such as ours.

210,House,99,-0.458,714,7,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman,  al though I initially voted for the Hamil ton substitute amendment  to House  Joint Resolution 247, I cannot in good  faith support the final passage of this  resolution. I agree with the principles  offered by Representative Hamilton's  substitute amendment prohibiting aid  to the Contras, yet providing both hu manitarian aid and support for the re gional  peace negotiations. However,  last night, the Senate passed its own  version of this resolution, and agreed  to  the Reagan  administration's  re quest to give the Contras $14 million  in aid to continue the covert war in  Nicaragua. Our two resolutions are at  opposite ends, and I am not convinced  that a compromise can be reached be tween the House and the Senate ver sions that will provide the necessary  safeguards to end terrorism and vio lence  in Nicaragua and achieve our  common goals of peace, internal recon ciliation, regional security, and democ racy. I am,  therefore, voting against  this resolution.  Our  decision whether  to  provide  funds to the Contras will have a pro found influence on the shape and di rection of our foreign policy not only  in Nicaragua and Central America but  throughout the world. I strongly be lieve  that only  through diplomatic  channels and regional negotiations in volving the Sandinistas, the Contadora  countries and the United States, can a  peaceful solution be found to end the  raging conflict in Nicaragua that has  destroyed thousands of innocent men,  women, and children.  Last night,  I voted against House  Joint Resolution  239, which would  fund the Contras, encourage covert ac tivity aimed at overthrowing the San dinista  government  and  undermine  American foreign policy in the region.  I  also voted against  the  substitute  amendment offered by Representative  MICHEL that provides $14 million in as sistance to the Contras, to be distrib uted by the U.S. Agency for Interna tional Development. We should have  learned from our painful experiences  in Vietnam-American  expansionism  will not bring peace or an end to the  undeclared war in Nicaragua.  Even if the United States could over throw the Sandinistas by funding the  Contras, America's credibility and re solve for democratic principles would  be forever compromised in the eyes of  our allies throughout the world.  Even if the Reagan administration  could convince  the American people  that the Contras were,  indeed,  free dom  fighters who are  risking  their  lives to def eat communism and install  democracy in Nicaragua, rather than a  band of  terrorists and  international  criminals,  still  the United  States  would set a dangerous precedent. The  administration  is  fomenting political  instability, rather than seeking peace ful means to the end of respect for  human rights, democracy, and coop eration in the region.  Even  if the administration demon strated that Nicaragua and the Mana gua regime is a threat to the United  States, it would not justify these ac tions which are clearly seen as illegal  and immoral in the world community  and the World Court.  The Reagan administration claims  not to inter! ere in the internal affairs  of other countries, but seeks an  in volvement which is neither justifiable  or realistic in promoting the cause of  freedom and democracy. If we  truly  wish to promote the cause of justice  and freedom, we must use the weapons  of diplomacy, dialog, and political de termination, not the hired guns of the  Contras.  I  agree with my  colleagues-and  hundreds of constituents who have  written to me in recent months-that  resuming aid to the Contras will sabo tage any chance of peacefully resolv ing the conflict in Nicaragua; will pro long suffering and bloodshed; and will  serve  to  strengthen,  rather  than  weaken the worst elements of the San dinista regime.  Mrs. LLOYD, Mr. Chairman, I want  to rise and say a few words in support  of the Michel amendment.

211,House,99,-0.194,727,7,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, I am pleased to join my colleague,  the gentleman from New York, in in troducing the Space Tax Investment  Equity Act of 1985.  This bill  illustrates  the  foresight  necessary if we are to be prepared for  this next economic frontier for Amer ica. Current law does not allow equip ment that is used  in outer space  to  apply the investment tax credit, accel erated depreciation, or  the research  and  development  tax  credit  to  its  value. Companies like Grumman, Fair child, McDonnell Douglas,  and 3M,  who plan to begin manufacturing in  space, are  facing obvious extra ex pense because of this tax differential.  This barrier is unintentional and will  prove to be counterproductive.  Our bill would extend  the  invest ment tax credit, the accelerated depre ciation tax benefits, and the R&D tax  credit to those companies whose place  of business  is  in outer space rather  than here on Earth  in  the United  States. When we first began the early  flights into space, we did not antici pate that space would become a place  of business. We must remove this un intended tax before these businesses  are lost to the American economy. In vestments  in space activities already  must  compete with  those here on  Earth in the United States-as well as  with those investments international ly, and it is clear that we will be facing  stiff  competition,  particularly  from  the  the Germans, and  the French,  Japanese.  This  legislation will  assure  that  space ventures are treated essentially  the same as Earth ventures under our  tax code. Clearly,  the age of space  commerce has dawned. Space will be  the arena for expanding commercial  activity including communications sat ellites, upper stage systems, industrial  and scientific experiments, and manu facturing. Private investment in these  commercial enterprises is able to take  advantage of the unique characteris tics of space, such as vacuum, micro gravity, and radiation.  We can produce rare medicines with  the potential of saving thousands of  lives and hundreds of millions of dol lars; we can manufacture superchips  that can build space observatories ena bling scientists to see out to the edge  of the universe; and we can produce  special alloys and biological materials  that benefit greatly from zero gravity  environment.  To foster these exciting embryonic  industries, we must pave the way by  eliminating obstructions and allowing  these industries to compete at least on  an equal footing with those already  here on Earth. I would urge the early  passage of this legislation.e  ORDER OF BUSINESS  ",1985

213,House,99,0.422,753,7,Mr. RUDD.," Mr. Speaker,  I have  called this special order today to dis cuss U.S. policy  in Central America  and particularly the urgency in provid ing the requested $14 million for the  freedom fighters in Nicaragua.  Earlier this month, I had the oppor tunity to accompany a delegation, led  by Congressman G.V. MONTGOMERY,  from the Armed Services Committee  on a tour of seven Latin American na tions,  including Panama, Costa Rica,  Honduras, El Salvador, and Belize in  Central America. The feeling there is  much different than just 1 year ago,  and the people have no doubt that the  United States  of America  is  their  friend. They are watching Congress  closely now to see if we have the cour age and the will to support them in  their struggle  to make real progress  toward strong democracies, or if we  will abandon them to fend for them selves against Marxist/Leninist insur gents.  In 1979, two-thirds of the people in  Latin America  lived under military  governments, or governments domi nated by the military. Today, however,  that situation has changed dramatical ly. Over 90 percent of those people are  living under democratic governments.  Since 1980 alone, military juntas have  returned the reigns of government to  civilians  in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador,  Honduras, Argentina,  El  Salvador,  Panama, Uruguay, and Brazil.

214,,99,-0.496,779,7,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to call attention to the plight of  Soviet Jews.  Jewish emigration has declined dra matically in recent years from 51,000  in 1979 to less than 1,000 in 1984. De spite the change in Soviet leadership  and the resumption of arms control  negotiations, Soviet mistreatment of  Jews and refuseniks continues unabat ed.  Sadly, we  in Congress have  little  direct leverage with which to persuade  the Soviet leadership to abandon its  campaign of harassment and intimida tion.  We can, however, call international  attention to the unjust treatment of  these people by bringing to light the  cases  of  individual  refuseniks  and  their families.  One such case is that of Isaac and  Sophie Kogan. I was first made aware  of the problems facing Isaac Kogan  and his family when a constituent of  mine contacted me during a  recent  visit to Washington by members of the  Student Coalition for Soviet Jewry.  Kogan, a refusenik from Leningrad,  first applied  for permission  to emi grate from the Soviet Union in 1974.  His  request was denied for security  reasons. Yet 2 years earlier, Kogan  had voluntarily resigned his position  at an electronics factory, for which he  was trained, to work as a manual la borer on  the Leningrad  railroad  in  order to avoid any connection with se curity work.  In August 1976, Kogan  was again denied a visa, this time with  a warning: ""You will crumble before  you get out."" Ten years later, Isaac  Kogan is working as a delivery man  and still trying to get out of the Soviet  Union. Even though he has not been  in a profession which would make him  privy to anything dealing with govern ment  security,  the  authorities  still  refuse to allow him and his family to  leave because of security reasons.  Mr. Speaker, we must continue  to  communicate and publicize our dissat isfaction to the Soviet leadership  in  hopes  that public pressure will per suade Soviet authorities to end their  oppressive  treatment  of  Soviet  Jewry.e  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.

215,,99,0.346,792,7,Mr. STANGELAND.," Mr. Speaker,  the Reagan administration has provid ed Congress with a 1985 farm bill pro posal  that would be disastrous  for  Minnesota farmers. Under the banner  of market orientation, the administra tion's plan calls for pain, not profit,  for American agriculture.  On the other hand, there are those  who wishfully think the answer to all  of  agriculture's  problems  will  be  achieved by merely cutting back our  production. What do  they think we  have been doing? While we have im plemented  supply management pro grams  in 5 of the last 6 years, our  export  competitors  have  expanded  both acreage and production. At the  same time, our world export market  share  in wheat has dropped  from  almost one-half  to about one-third  while  our export  competitors have  gained by the same amount.  Both of these approaches would put  American agriculture on a sure fire  course for self-destruction. Sometime  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  down the road the Reagan administra tion's proposal would certainly make  our exports price competitive-but it  would be a joyless victory after count ing the number of farmers who would  be sacrificed in the process. There is  also no question that strict mandatory  production controls would ultimately  raise  farm prices. But would  it be  worth laying idle 40 to 50 percent of  the  richest cropland  in  the world?  Saying goodbye  to our hard earned  export markets? Dashing any hopes  for significant market growth in the  future? Adding American agriculture  to the list of slowly dying U.S. indus tries  that  have  already  conceded  def eat to foreign competition?  The Reagan administration's farm  bill proposal isn't truly market orient ed because it doesn't call for our Gov ernment to fight as hard for our farm ers in the world market as other gov ernments  fight  for  their  farmers.  Those who only advocate strict man datory production controls want  to  give up without even trying to fight  back.  Farmers aren't quitters. Most have  had  to  fight  for everything  they've  got. I think they just want to see our  Government start implementing poli cies  that work  for  them  instead of  against them.  It's about  time  our Government  commit itself to matching foreign gov ernments subsidy for subsidy. The cor nerstone of this year's market-orient ed farm bill should be to immediately  transfer the pain of unfair trade poli cies from our farmers to those govern ments, both  foreign  and our own,  which are guilty of creating agricul ture's problems.  WHEAT, FEED GRAINS TITLE  MARKET-ORIENTED LOAN  The market-oriented loan is a con cept which, if implemented, would im mediately make our exports price com petitive and still protect farm income.  Under the market-oriented loan plan,  commodity loan rates would be main tained for the 1986 crop at the 1985  levels. However, farmers could sell the  crop under loan at any time during  the 9-month  loan period and would  only be required to repay based upon  the world market price. The farmer  would pocket the difference between  the loan rate and the repayment rate.  The market-oriented loan approach  has two overriding advantages. First of  all, it protects farm income. By main taining the loan rate at the 1985 crop  level, farm prices and income will not  suffer as they would under the admin istration's proposal.  Second, and of greater importance in  the long run, it significantly reduces  Government involvement in the grain  business. For years, both our export  competitors and grain-buying nations  have taken advantage of us because we  have pursued agricultural policies that  have made us the world's great stockApril 24, 1985  piler and residual supplier. Our will ingness to hold grain has allowed our  export competitors to gradually chip  away an ever  larger portion of our  world market share. In addition, it en courages foreign consuming nations to  buy hand to mouth and simply let us  worry about holding reserve stocks. In  recent years,  this policy has dearly  cost our farmers in both lost markets  and lower prices.  By moving this grain into commer cial channels instead of continuing to  allow  surplus stocks hang over  the  market and depress prices, the follow ing are just a few of the positive re sults  that would occur: burdensome  surplus stocks would be removed, for eign governments would  incur enor mous costs for continuing their export  subsidies, our grain would immediately  be price  competitive  in  the export  market, lost foreign markets could be  regained, farm income would be pro tected, and the groundwork would be  laid to ensure our farmers will fully  benefit in the future from American  agriculture's comparative advantage in  the world market.  The market-oriented loan will allow  American agriculture's transition to a  truly market-oriented,  and market winning, approach without the devas tating consequences that would other wise occur under the administration's  plan.  The market-oriented loan then can  be viewed as a cushioning tool to get  us where we need to go without throw ing farmers off the farm in the proc ess. Also,  its ability  to  immediately  make our exports price competitive  should  improve  the prospects  for a  much quicker  turnaround  in world  commodity prices by discouraging pro duction in competitor nations and en hancing demand.  TARGET PRICES  In addition to the marketing loan,  target prices should continue to be uti lized to maintain farm income.  Target  prices  for  the  1986  crop  would be set at the national average  cost of production,  including returns  to land. The cost of production deter mination would have to be approved  by the National Agricultural Cost of  Production Standards Review Board made up of producers representing all  regions of  the country-but  in any  case may not be set at less than $4. 75  per bushel for wheat and $3.45 per  bushel  for  corn. Target prices  for  other feed grains would be set at a  level which is fair and reasonable in  relation to corn.  Many believe that the structure of  past  farm  programs-with  benefits  tied directly to the amount a farmer  produces-has actually worked to dis courage our efforts to control overpro duction.

216,,99,0.691,805,7,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker,  today I am reintroducing a bill to alle viate the continuing problems created  by anticompetitive and anticonsumer  warranties contained in the Clean Air  Act.  First, it would limit production and  performance warranties on emission  systems  to 2 years/24,000 miles and  make sure the list of parts covered is  not subsequently expanded. It would  specifically  limit  the 5 year/50,000mile warranty to the catalytic convert er,  the  thermal  reactor,  and parts  solely used for emissions control. EPA  would retain the right to recall emis sion system failures for 5 years/50,000  miles.  Second,  it  further  increases  competition by repealing the counter productive parts certification program  and by doing away with the waiver  that  allows  auto manufacturers  to  specify the use of one of their own  parts. Third,  it permits  independent  California  auto  parts  dealers  and  repair  shops  to operate under  the  same  warranty  requirements  that  apply in other States. And finally, it  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  clarifies the antitampering provisions  of the law.  In  1977,  Congress  amended  the  Clean Air Act  to protect  the small  businessman and the consumer from  anticompetitive emissions warranties.  Parts  to be warranted  for  the ex tended period were  limited to  those  that are installed primarily to control  emissions.  EPA expanded the list of parts cov ered by the warranty through regula tions. The Automotive Service Indus try Association CASIAl and the Auto motive Parts Rebuilders Association  CAPRAl  filed suit  in 1980, asserting  that the regulations were contrary to  the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.  In a separate action, vehicle manufac turers and importers filed suit on the  warranty  and  certification matters,  and included a legal objection to the  short test regulations issued by EPA.  The court ordered consolidation of the  cases, forcing joint consideration of af termarket and vehicle manufacturer  issues.  Prior to final court arguments, ASIA  and APRA presented to EPA a techni cal  report  by  Packer Engineering  which  analyzed  the  specific  parts  under  consideration,  the  particular  performance objectives of such parts  and the historical nature of their use.  Based on this report and other inf or mation supplied to EPA by ASIA and  APRA,  a  tentative  consensus was  reached which would have substantial ly limited the parts subject to the ex tended  5  year /50,000-mile  perform ance warranty  The court recognized that Congress  did in fact act to reduce the anticom petitive effects of a broad coverage/  long length warranty in 1977. Howev er, it accepted the EPA interpretation  that the warranty coverage  for  the  first 2 years/24,000 miles was for all  components affecting emissions. With  respect  to  coverage  after 2 years/  24,000 miles, the court avoided a direct  decision on  the correctness of  the  parts list  issued by EPA. The court  stated that the parts list was advisory  only  and  therefore not  subject  to  attack.  The court did not disturb the liber ties taken by EPA in misinterpreting  the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air  Act. EPA regulations provide that not  only sole or primary parts must be  warranted, but also secondary parts  which fail because of a failed primary  part. The court's decision on the certi fication issues transformed a congres sional edict to provide a program to  avoid monopoly into one which actual ly creates an anticompetitive situation  worse than would occur if no such pro gram were instituted.  EPA regulations provide that an af termarket manufacturer who certifies  parts is liable for all costs incurred by  a vehicle manufacturer caused by the  failure of that certified part. One issue  9343  before the court was how this liability  was to be assumed. EPA regulations  required  reimbursement without de tailing how such reimbursement was  to be effected.  The court ruled that EPA must pro vide some forum for resolution of re imbursement disputes. Certifiers must,  as a condition of certification, agree to  such a  reimbursement scheme. The  court discussed the vehicle manufac turer's demand that parts manufactur ers be required to post a bond to estab lish financial stability to actually per form  under  such  a  reimbursement  scheme and in a concurring opinion  that should strike terror in the heart  of every  small business, one  judge  went so far as to state that parts man ufacturers should be required by EPA  to post a bond in order to be certified  and that: ""The criticism that some af termarket parts manufacturers might  not be able to afford to post bond may  be correct, but, it is just those manu facturers who could not afford to post  a bond who need to be weeded out.""  All administrative and  legal  reme dies available to the independent af termarket have now been pursued.  Corrective legislation to put competi tion back into the law is needed. Such  legislation must clearly  remove  the  power of EPA to twist the intent of  Congress.  Mr. Speaker, this is an ever growing  problem  and,  from what  southern  California  independent garages have  shown me, it amounts to an extensive  loss of business. In the 97th Congress I  offered two bills dealing with this sub ject and one of them was almost com pletely incorporated into the compre hensive clean air bill, H.R. 5252, con sidered by the Energy and Commerce  Committee. Unfortunately the meas ure did not become law because of the  difficulty in resolving other issues. In  the 98th Congress I introduced a simi lar measure which I hoped might be  the solution to the problem. For all  States,  including California,  the bill  would have  reduced  the production  and  performance warranties  to  2  years/24,000 miles  for all emissions  system parts.  Mr. Speaker, we are confronted with  yet another example of good  inten tions gone astray. All of us want clean er air, but the adverse effects of these  warranties on the aftermarket and the  consuming public cannot be justified  or overlooked. They must be  taken  into account  if we are  interested in  preserving competition and an impor tant sector of the small business com munity. The legislation I have intro duced today will restore and preserve  that competition and, in the long run,  provide the best guarantee of protec tion that consumers can have.

April 23, 1985 marks the 350th  birthday of the Boston Latin School,  the oldest public school in the United  States of America.  The Latin School was founded by  the town of Boston and has been in  continuous existence since 1635.  Its  founders shared the belief of the an cient Greeks that the only good things  in life are good of the soul. From its  earliest origins, the Latin School has  taught  its scholars dissent with  re sponsibility and has encouraged that  climate. Today, the Latin School es pouses a curriculum that is centered in  the humanities to over 2,300 full-time  students. Without a doubt, this insti tution stands for all that is valued in  our educational system as it continues  to equip Boston area youths with the  knowledge necessary to make a posi tive contribution to our society.

We have all heard on the news the  pleas by desperate families with sad eyed children who must have organ  transplants  if  they are  to  live. We  have had our hearts warmed by the  success stories when people are given a  second chance at life because of an  organ transplant. But we seldom see  the  stories  about  the  children  for  whom time ran out-the children who  should have  lived, could have  lived,  but never  received  the organs  they  needed.  I know about  the heartbreak,  the  frustration, the sense of helplessness  because I shared that experience with  a small child, Ashley Bailey, and her  family who live  in my district. Born  with biliary artesia, Ashley fought for  more than a year to hold on to life  until a proper liver could be located  for transplantation. During that time  there  surely were many  potential  donors who  could have  shared  life  with Ashley. But  like millions  .of  Americans,  their  families were not  aware of the need for organ donors,  and  tragically, Ashley died waiting.  During 1984, only an estimated 3,000  out of 23,000 potential donors actually  donated their organs and tissues. That  means that in addition to the loss of  the potential donors' lives, thousands  of waiting recipients met death need lessly.  It's obvious  that  organ  donation  helps save and improve  the  lives of  others .. what is sometimes less obvious  is that donation can diminish the suf fering and grief caused by the sudden,  unexpected death of the donor. In a  tragedy that seems meaningless, organ  donation can provide some meaning  for the grieving survivors.  Medical technology has given us the  ability  to do miraculous  things, but  that can occur only if each individual  makes the miracle happen. With the  memory of all those individuals who  never  received  the  transplants  they  needed, and for  the sake of all  the  people who will yet need transplants  in the future, I urge each Member of  Congress to take this opportunity to  encourage  all  constituents  to  sign  donor cards and notify their friends  and relatives of their desire to ""make  a miracle.""

221,,99,-0.308,844,7,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Speaker, in many  parts of our country, there is a lot of  talk these days about industrial devel opment-about  the need  to  attract  new factories, new employers.  Recently,  the Trade Subcommittee  of the House Ways and Means Com mittee visited an industrial park that  would have made the heads of  job hungry Americans spin. It was clean,  bright, completely modem, well-land scaped,  and  occupied  by  literally  dozens of U.S. firms.  Unfortunately,  it was  in  Juarez,  Mexico, just across the border from El  Paso, TX. Hundreds of American com panies have set up factories Just across  the United States-Mexican border-at  the expense of American Jobs.  This is the topic of my most recent  weekly newspaper column. It follows:  (cid:1)VASHINGTONREPORT  <By Don J. Pease)  In northern Ohio,  there  is much  talk  these days about industrial development about the need to attract new factories, new  employers, to the area.  You should have seen the industrial park  I visited two weeks ago. Literally dozens of  U.S. firms have set up factories employing  thousands of workers.  The industrial park itself is attractive and  well-landscaped. The factory buildings are  uniformly new or nearly new.  Inside, 200, 400, 600 workers toll in each  factory. Each building  interior  is bright,  clean,  well-lit,  air  conditioned,  well equipped. A company cafeteria serves work ers meals at half the normal price. A compa ny infirmary is staffed by a nurse and vis ited regularly by a doctor.  The employes seem happy and content.  They are, according to their supervisors, ef ficient, productive, highly motivated work ers.  From the viewpoint of job-hungry north ern Ohioans, there is just one hitch in this  rosy picture. The industrial park is not in  the United States.  It's in Juarez, Mexico,  just across  border from El Paso, Texas.  The workers in those factories are Mexi cans.  They work for 68 cents an hour.  And they are drawing U.S. companies by  the hundreds to Mexico.  So far, over 650 American companies have  set up assembly operations in Juarez; No gales and other cities along the 1900-mlle  U.S.-Mexican border. General Motors, Gen eral Electric, RCA, Rockwell International,  Samsonite Corp., United Technologies Inc. the list goes on and on.  The managers of those U.S.-owned factories are clearly skittish about the 68-centsan-hour wages. They quickly make  points.  First,  the 68 cents  is  the hourly  rate.  Total employment cost  is about $1.40 per  hour when fringe benefits <mostly required  by the Mexican government> are factored  in.  the  April 24, 1985  Second, it is claimed, the assembly plants  in Mexico help to preserve jobs in the U.S.  that would otherwise be lost. Typically, the  Mexican ""maquila"" plants are strictly as sembly operations. All of the design and en gineering work is done at U.S. locations. All  of the parts to be assembled are made in the  U.S.  In fact, one incentive for the ""maqulla""  plants is that when the finished products  are returned to the U.S., the value of the  original U.S. parts and material is not sub ject to U.S. tariffs. U.S. duty is paid only on  the  ""value  added""  <i.e.,  labor  costs>  in  Mexico.  American firms claim they can't compete  with  Japanese, Korean,  Taiwanese  and  other competitors  if  they must pay high  American wages for hand assembly work.  The choice, they say, is this. Do you split  the work between a U.S. plant and a ""twin""  plant in Mexico, or do you lose the work al together?  There is evidence of truth to that conten tion. In Georgia and South Carolina, for ex ample, apparel manufacturers  find  it  in creasingly difficult to compete with import ed apparel from the Far East. By moving  their sewing operations  to Mexico,  these  companies preserve  jobs at home  in  the  design and cutting of fabrics. They also, in cidentally, continue to be in business as cus tomers of U.S. textile companies. Obviously,  apparel made in China uses textiles made in  China.  Still, it was wrenching for me to see all  those jobs in Mexico which used to be per formed in Ohio and elsewhere in the U.S.  If the choice of workers at an American  factory really is between no jobs at all and  sharing the jobs, the choice is clear if not  entirely pleasant.  But what of U.S. manufacturing  firms  which do not face foreign competition or  which are still competitive in the interna tional marketplace? They may not be forced  to move  their  assembly  operations  to  Mexico, but they can make higher profits if  they can cut their compensation costs  to  $1.40 per hour for hand assembly work. In  other words, if a company is making 9 per cent profit in the U.S., what is to prevent its  moving to Mexico and increasing its profit  to 10 percent? After all, the business of busi ness is to make a profit, and a good manager  is expected to maximize his or her compa ny's profit.  The Americans I  talked with in Juarez,  didn't have an answer  to  the question.  Frankly, I don't have an answer either. But  the question merits a  lot of  thought by  those of us who are trying desperately to  retain and foster economic health in areas  like northern Ohio.e  INTRODUCTION OF SPACE  WEAPONS TREATY RESOLUTION  HON.

222,House,99,0.173,870,7,Mr. HILLIS.," Mr. Speaker, what has  happened to the Democratic Party?  Why has  the party of Jefferson,  Jackson, Roosevelt, and Kennedy-the  party which has played such a signifi cant role in the evolution of American  liberty-become so morally bankrupt  as to deny Rick Mcintyre the seat to  which he was elected?  Why  has  the Democratic  Party  chosen to cut the thread of fair play  and political decency which forms the  very  fabric of  the democracy under  which we live?  Why have they chosen to use their  numbers in this body to impose their  will on a half million unrepresented  Hoosi~rs?  And why has the leadership chosen  to compromise  the working relation ship between the majority and minori ty parties in this House by making the  Eighth District of Indiana a test of po litical macho?  In the end, you may seat your candi date, Mr. Speaker, but you cannot vio late  both  principle  and  precedent  without a price.  There may be no antidote to counter  the poison which now stands as bar rier between Republicans and Demo crats and the work they need to ac complish in this Congress.

225,,99,-0.444,1000,7,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, if the  administration has its way, the United  States will  be  the  only  developed  nation in the world without a national  passenger rail service. Despite increas ing ridership and decreasing reliance  on Federal subsidies, Amtrak is slated  for  extinction  under  the  proposed  budget for fiscal year 1986.  A review of Amtrak's recent record  and the effect of its elimination reveal  the administration's plan to be penny wise and pound-foolish. Over the last  14 years, the Federal Government has  spent $5.2 billion in upgrading the sys tem's  infrastructure  and  improving  the service in the Northeast corridor  between Boston and Washington. This  investment  is now beginning  to pay  off, with Amtrak transporting over 20  million passengers in 1984, an 18-per cent increase over 1983 ridership, with  its  best  ever  on-time  performance.  This has come while the Federal Gov ernment's share of operating expenses  has decreased, dropping from $896 mil lion in fiscal year 1981 to $684 million  in fiscal year 1985.  And what will it cost to dismantle  the  system? As  the Boston Globe  points out in the following editorial,  25,000 Amtrak  employees,  including  over 700  in Massachusetts, would be  laid off, costing the Federal Govern ment an estimated $2.1 billion in labor  protection benefits.  SAVING AMTRAK  The Amtrak rail passenger system was one  of the achievements of the Nixon Adminis tration. Under  the  leadership of  former  Massachusetts. Gov. John Volpe, who was  then Secretary of Transportation, the feder al government took over passenger service  from the railroads, which had found it a  money loser.  The arrangement has worked well. After a  difficult transition. Amtrak's employees and  managers  have  cooperated  admirably  to  hold down costs and improve service. Last  year the system carried 20 million passen gers.  The Reagan Administration proposes  to  shut down Amtrak to ""save"" $684 million in  annual subsidies. There would be no savings  for some years, since the government would  have to pay more than $2 billion in sever ance  to  the 25,000 employees who would  lose their Jobs, and it would have to write  off more than $3 billion in equipment and  other assets.  It is misleading for the Administration to  assert that Amtrak competes unfairly with  unsubsidized rival forms of transportation.  All modes of transportation are subsidized,  directly or indirectly. Buses do not pay for  the full cost of the highways and streets  that they travel. The government subsidizes  airlines by providing air traffic control.  Because air service is so much faster than  rail service, Amtrak does not compete with  the airlines for business passengers except  April 25, 1985  on very short trips. The much higher price  of air travel shows that business travelers  would rather save time than money. The or dinary weekday fare between Boston and  New York  is $25  for a  five-hour  trip on  Amtrak compared  to $65  for a 30-minute  flight on the Eastern shuttle.  Amtrak, however, does compete with air lines for the business of low-income travel ers of families with small children. It also  competes with bus companies, which charge  slightly less for a slightly faster trip. If it  were to be put out of business, the bus lines  would be free to raise their fares substan tially, and low-income travelers would have  no choice.  W. Graham Claytor Jr., the chairman of  Amtrak, points out that it is the only form  of  transportation  that could move  large  numbers of people in a national emergency,  and that in many small communities, it is  the only  transportation.  If  it were abol ished, the United States would be the only  industrial nation without a  rail passenger  system. Claytor has promised  to wage a  battle to save Amtrak. He deserves public  and congressional support.e  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  THE  STROM  THURMOND  HIGH  SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL TEAM  HON. BUTLER DERRICK  OF SOUTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 25, 1985  e ",1985
226,,99,-0.215,1000,7,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  you and my colleagues to join with me  in honoring a group of young people  in my home county, Edgefield, SC,  which has distinguished itself in inter scholastic competition.  For the second year in a  row,  the  Strom Thurmond High School Mock  Trial Team has brought home  the  State's top trophy.  Coached by the Honorable Greg An derson, an Edgefield attorney, and fac ulty members Mrs. Vickie McAlister  and Ms. Denise Jackson, team attor neys  included Tyra Bush, Michael  Medlock, April Abel, Laurie Rhoden,  Kathryn Wooten, and Cassandra Lott.  Other particpants were Will Luquire,  Lori Black, Trieneke Kylstra, Zena  Calhoun, Errol Gordon, Sonny Reel,  and Leonard Knight.  These students and  their coaches  have worked diligently to bring honor  to their school and to carry on the tra dition of Edgefield County which has  always been known for its outstanding  attorneys and judges.  Debates  are  a  tradition  in  our  county, dating back a century and a  half.  Such  emphasis  on  oratorical  skills accounts for Edgefield County  having produced 10 governors, 5 lieu tenant  governors  and many  other  statesmen. These young people have  been  grooming  themselves  for  key  roles in the U.S. citizenry and I com mend them for their winning efforts.e  ",1985
227,,99,-0.321,1013,7,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  and my distinguished colleagues, I am  introducing a bill today that will pro tect, preserve and enhance the health  care delivery system in rural America.  The National Health Service Corps  Reauthorization bill will provide key  medical personnel to our citizens living  in  medically  underserved  areas  throughout this great Nation.  The National Health Service Corps  serves over 2 million Americans. In my  Third Congressional District of New  Mexico  alone-over  100,000  people  who  live  in rural and remote areas  have come to depend on the National  Health Service Corps staffed clinics  for  their principal sources of health  care.  The National Health Service Corps  reauthorization bill that I am intro ducing today addresses many of the  concerns expressed in the President's  veto message last year and includes all  provisions agreed upon in last year's  House/Senate conference report. The  bill will authorize the National Health  Service Corps Program for an addi tional 3 years. It will authorize  the  Health Service Corps Scholarship Pro gram for the same period of time and  provide funding for 1,175 new scholar ships to train and educate medical per sonnel in addition to continuing cur rent scholarships.  The National Health Service Corps  provides medical personnel to medical ly underserved areas throughout the  country. It is not a government give away program. These medical person nel in return for Government scholar ship aid, make a commitment to serve  in a health service corps clinic for a  limited period of  time. The clinics  then pay back the Government for its  9551  cost in educating the individual-in ad dition to a salary.  Mr. Speaker,  the National Health  Service Corps is vital national program  that makes a major difference in the  lives of  rural Americans who have  come to depend on the services provid ed.  Since President Reagan took office  there have been virtually no n.ew Na tional Health Service Corps scholar ships. Without new doctors  in  the  pipeline the program will die.  A high percentage of the patients  who use Health Service Corps staffed  clinics  throughout  the country are  older Americans living on small fixed  incomes who  have  chronic  health  problems.  This bill benefits the Nation as a  whole.  It  is  a  creative,  low  cost,  common sense approach to successful ly deliver quality health care to those  in need. I hope that my colleagues will  join with me in supporting the reau thorization of  the National Health  Service Corps Program and not allow  this administration  to roll back  the  clock  to  a  time when many  rural  Americans had no access  to health  care. I hope the President will develop  some compassion and see the wisdom  in continuing a health care program  which  is so critical  to  the needs of  rural Americans.e  NEVADA'S VOICE FOR  DEMOCRACY  HON.

228,,99,-0.398,1026,7,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, this  week, April 21 through April 27, is Na tional Coin Week. This distinctive and  unique week serves to recognize the  historical,  cultural,  and  educational  significance  of numismatics  in  the  United States.  The theme is of this year's National  Coin Week is ""Numismatics: Open the  Door with Books."" The  theme  is a  timely one. Coins can be a wonderful  teaching aid, and an interest in foreign  coins can stimulate not only an inter est in history and geography but of  foreign languages and customs as well.

230,Senate,99,0.263,1078,7,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to  introduce by request this  legislation to authorize the transfer of  Washington National and Washington  Dulles Airports from the Federal Gov ernment to a local operating author ity.  This bill, which was drafted by the  Department of Transportation, is not  perfect. However,  it is a step in the  right direction, and Secretary Eliza beth Dole and former Gov. Linwood  Holton are to be commended for their  vision and perseverance in crafting a  legislative plan to transfer the airports  to local control.  I have questions about a number of  elements in this legislation. The Com merce committee and the full Senate  must carefully examine each element  of this bill, and pay particular atten tion to the potential elimination of the  passenger cap and the continuing ap plicability of the current time slot lim itations and night-time noise  rules.  The application of the-National Envi ronmental Policy Act CNEPAl  to air port activities and the jurisdiction of  the National Capital Planning Com mission CNCPCl must also be  fully  considered.  If we fail to succeed in enacting this  legislation during  this Congress, we  face the prospect of these airports re maining under Federal control in per petuity. This  is  an  outcome  that  nobody would prefer-local residents,  the Department  of Transportation,  and the commercial airlines all recog nize the benefits which will come from  local management.  As a member of the Commerce Com mittee, I look forward to the hearings  on this bill and to working with my  colleagues to ensure that this bill is ac ceptable and fair to all who are affect ed by these airports.

The purpose of this Joint resolution  is as simple as it is uncontroversial. It  is meant to provide a focus for people  from all walks of life and all political  persuasions  to come  together to ex plore and celebrate the boundless pos sibilities of a peaceful world.

233,Senate,99,-0.362,1156,7,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr.  President,  today,  I wish  to  join with Senator  PRYOR in paying tribute to Mr. Ikey L.  Baldwin who will  soon be  retiring  after 35 years of service to the people  of Arkansas through his work with the  Farmers Home Administration. Arkan sas, and especially Arkansas farmers,  have benefited greatly from his dedi cated years of service, and although  we are saddened by his retirement, we  are honored to have this opportunity  to recognize Ikey for his work.  Ikey is a decorated Army veteran of  World War II. He enlisted 1 month  after the attack on Pearl Harbor and  was discharged 5 years later as a first  lieutenant,  after  having  served  at  Dutch Harbor, AK, and at Honolulu,  Saipan, and Iwo Jima. Ikey continued  to serve his country in the Officers'  Reserve until December 1958.  Before  the war,  Ikey completed 2  years in general agriculture at what is  now Arkansas Tech University and he  completed his studies after the war at  Mississippi State University, receiving  a degree in agriculture in August 1947.  Over the years Ikey has pursued grad uate studies  in several disciplines at  Mississippi State, the University of Ar kansas, and at Henderson State Uni versity.  After a 2-year stint as superintend ent of the Jessieville, AR, High School  and another 2 years as an agriculture  instructor for World War II veterans  at Fountain Lake, AR, High School,  Ikey began his long service with the  FmHA in 1951 as an assistant county  supervisor. From  1951  to  1954  he  worked  in  this capacity  in Howard,  Hempstead  and Yell Counties,  and  from 1955 to 1961 he served as county  supervisor  in Lafayette County. He  was promoted to the State office in  1962. In addition to his regular duties  as a  farmer program specialist, Ikey  has served as the State appraisal train er  since  1969,  a  position  that has  gained him widespread recognition as  an expert in farm tract appraisal tech niques.  However, his crowning achievements  are the hundreds of Arkansas farmers  who are successfully  in business be cause of his guidance and assistance.  Add to this the countless numbers of  FmHA employees whom he has  tu tored over the years, from State direc tors to county office assistants, and we  can  understand  the  tremendous  impact he has had on our State. And,  of course, you can also add the forth right asslstance he has rendered  to  Senator PRYOR and myself, and others  in the congressional delegation, as ex amples of his value to the farmers of  Arkansas.  It is never easy to allow those with  so many years of experience to retire,  because  they  take  a  storehouse of  knowledge with them. This is especial ly true in Ikey's case. We can only be  grateful that those who have worked  with Ikey have learned from him, and  that his standards of excellence will  continue. As a  tribute  to his spirit,  Ikey has generated the rumor that he  is leaving the FmHA to begin a cypress  tree farm in the hill section of Gar land County, AR, and that we are all  invited to the first harvest 1 million or  so years from now. Seriously, we will  all miss Ikey, and we wish him the  best.e  ORDER OF BUSINESS  ",1985

Her  tireless  campaigning  for  women's suffrage serves as a strong  example  for women concerned with  justice. Women's suffrage was an im portant part of  the platform  that  brought her to Congress in 1917. She  crossed the entire country convincing  Americans  that women deserved  the  right  to vote alongside of men. On  January 10, 1918, Jeannette Rankin  introduced  the suffrage amendment,  the year in which it finally passed the  House.  She continually championed m .. pop ular causes. She supported children's  protective legislation at a  time when  children were considered a viable and  exploitable  labor  source.  Jeannette  Rankin was the only Member of Con gress who  voted  against America's  entry  into both World Wars. Even  though both these votes probably led  to her def eat  in running for office  again, she stood by her principles.

250,,99,-0.559,1221,7,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker,  today  we acknowledge the extensive talents  of Cliff Gonzalez, a young man whose  ability, determination and willpower  provides inspiration to his generation  and ours.  Cliff is a senior student-athlete at  St. Raymond High School  in  the  Bronx. Cliff's physical talents are dis played most vividly on the baseball  field,  where  his  accomplishments  earned him distinction as  the New  York Post's High School Athlete of  the Week. However, Cliff's accom plishments are not limited to the ball field. Cliff Gonzalez has close to a 90  average and also has a strong desire to  attain a college education before ful filling  his dream of  a  professional  baseball career. In these ways, Cliff  Gonzalez has earned our respect and  our admiration.  I would  like  to  extend my best  wishes to Cliff Gonzalez in his future  endeavors. For as the following article  accurately denotes, Cliff's enormous  talents will not end with high school.  CFrom the New York Post, Apr. 10,19851  POST HS ATHLETE OF WEEK  <By Steve Barenfeld)  Cliff Gonzalez can do it all-and last week  he did.  Gonzalez, a  senior centerfielder for St.  Raymond HS in The Bronx, went 10-for-16  with  two home  runs,  three doubles and  seven RBis to lead the Ravens to five victo ries.   The Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended  <42 United States Code 3001 et seq.).  9759  For his outstanding performance, Gonza lez, is The Post's High School Athlete of the  Week.  Gonzalez, 5-10, 155 pounds, started poorly  last week, Batting third, he went O-for-2 in a  3-2 win  over Lehman on Tuesday. On  Wednesday,  the  lefthanded-hitter,  who  throws righty, went 2-for-3 and drove in a  run in St. Ray's 14-0 rout of St. Francis  Prep. The next day he again was 2-for-3  with a double and an RBI in a 3-2 victory  over George Washington.  But it was Saturday when Gonzalez really  started banging the ball. He went 3-for-3  with a homer, two doubles and an RBI in  the morning when St. Ray's beat Mcclaney.  Later in the day,  in the Monroe Tourna ment, he went 3-for-5 with another home  run and stole his lOOth career base in a 27-0  stroll past Norman Thomas.  He doesn't plan on letting up, either.  ""I think I can keep up this pace,"" said  Gonzalez, who will be 18 next Thursday.  ""This is my last year and I want to leave  with a bang.""  There's no reason why he can't. Gonzalez,  who hit .454 last season, is a marvelous ath lete who  already was  considered major  league material. But he has gotten better.  ""I know  I've  improved  tremendously,""  Gonzalez said. ""This past winter I worked  on Nautilus and improved my strength. I'm  also  smarter and more  selective at  the  plate.""  ""He's the best player I've ever had,"" said  Raven coach Ron Patnosh, who  is  in his  18th year.  ""He does everything. He can  run-he goes from home to first in 3.8. He  hits for power and average. He has a major  league arm.""  ""I think he has a good shot to get draft ed.""  So does Gonzalez, but that doesn't mean  he""ll go right for a pro career.  ""If the money's right-over $40,000-1  would sign,"" he said.  ""But if not, I'll go to college,""  Seton Hall, St. John's, Oklahoma State  and Old Dominion have offered him full  scholarships. But Gonzalez, who has close  to a 90 average, would like to go to Yale.  ""I'd like to be a business person,"" he said.  ""I know they have an average baseball pro gram, but I don't think where you play in  college makes that much of a difference.  You really develop in summer leagues.  ""I've  always  loved  baseball,  and my  friends get mad at me because I'm always  either playing or watching on TV, I'd love to  play major league ball and I feel I have a  very good shot.""

251,,99,-0.082,1234,7,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, the  Treasury Department's new tax pro posal would severely  impact  the oil  and gas industry in my home State of  Ohio-an industry which just enjoyed  its finest year ever. I rise today to ex press my opposition  to  three major  components of  the Treasury's plan  that would have wide-ranging negative  effects in the oil and gas industry in  Ohio.  The Treasury's  tax plan  includes  three proposals that I am very con cerned about. They are: First, loss of  intangible  drilling  cost  deduction;  second, repeal of statutory depletion;  and third, elimination of investment  tax credit. These three proposals,  if  enacted, would be a severe blow to the  fiscal health of Ohio's oil and gas in dustry. A recent survey by the Ohio  Oil and Gas Association regarding the  Treasury's proposals  revealed  some  disturbing  information.  If enacted,  these proposals would have the follow ing effects: First, expenditures for oil  and gas production in Ohio would de cline  by  72  percent;  second,  the  number of new wells in Ohio would de cline by 71 percent;  third,  revenues  paid  to  related  industries  in Ohio  would  decline  by  54  percent;  and  fourth, employment in the industry in  Ohio would be cut by 43 percent.  While all of the above facts are quite  disturbing, I am most concerned about  the unacceptable amount of jobs that  'would be lost and the grave reduction  in oil and gas production in Ohio. In  my home district the unemployment  has been one of the highest  in the  Nation for several years. The State of  Ohio  is struggling to catch up with  this so-called economic recovery. The  oil and gas industry had been a steady  part of Ohio's economic growth. If the  ",1985

253,House,99,-0.186,1260,7,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, along with a majority of my col leagues in the House, I voted against  military assistance for the Contras in  Nicaragua. I did so with trepidation  and with a certain amount of reserve  because that is a villainous, oppressive  government,  a  godless  government,  and it should not take any aid and  comfort from that vote.  I voted as I did in large part because  I do not think we have done every thing short of military action to indi cate our disrespect for  that govern ment and to try to replace it with a  democratic form of government.  I, for example, would suggest that  the American people would be amazed  to know that the No. 1 trading partner  of Nicaragua is the United States. De pending on whose view you take, we  export up to $120 million a year and  import some $60 million a year from  Nicaragua.  I think the average American would  be amazed to know that our Embassy  is open and doing business in Mana gua.  And,  I  think the people would be  amazed to know that you can board an  airplane and fly  into Managua very  freely and openly.  I, for one, Mr. Speaker, suggest to  the President that there be an imme diate  trade embargo ordered against  Nicaragua in which we would ask our  partners and allies  in  the world  to  join. I believe commercial airline serv ice ought to be cut off to Nicaragua  from the United States.   Mr. Speaker, we have spoken with a  garbled message. Up till now we have  condemned  the Sandinistas and ar ranged trade deals with them all in  the same breath, I think now we have  to  speak with  a  very  clear  voice  against the Sandinistas. Let's not con fuse the issue.

This  is  one gesture  that  should not be made, one symbol that  should not be honored.  Germany has  traveled  light-years  since the horrors of Hitler's reign.

257,House,99,-0.378,1273,7,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er,  I am a  friend of Frank McClos key's, and it was because of that when  I approached the report, I tried to do  so with special care and special objec tivity.  Among the questions I asked were  these: If Mr. Mcintyre had won by  four votes, would I have voted to seat  him? The answer is yes. And I am con fident the majority party would have  done so.  I asked a second question: Did the  minority suggest before the end of the  court, before  the end of the count,  that if there were a razor-thin vote for  Mr. Mcintyre, there should be a spe cial election? And the answer is no;  quite the contrary. Here is what the  minority member of  the  task  force  early on had to say about a special  election:  I think that anyone who says we are not  going to be able to seat someone and there fore we ought to start talking about special  elections  to my mind not only being  unfair to the difficult task we have in front  of us, but I would attribute some sinister  motives to that kind of talk.  is  So, two things in terms of that state ment. It was not until the count was  completed that there was talk on the  minority side of a special election.  Second,  and  very  importantly,  throughout there has been a comment  from the minority side that those on  the majority side are beset by sinister  motivations.  In my judgment, there is reason for  argument here, for a decent difference  of opinion, but not for vilification or  vituperation.  I am concerned with the tone of this  debate, what it could mean for issues  that lie ahead, where bipartisanship is  needed.  I am confident of my position. I have.  a belief in the integrity of the mem bers of  the  task  force. Therefore,  those who throw stones at the majori ty are throwing them instead at this  .  ",1985

In 1910, the Gutter family arrived in  Tylertown,  where  they  discovered  there was no Baptist Church. The late  Brother George Gutter searched for a  place where  the  community might  worship. He found a cattleshed and  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  began working  to  renovate  it. One  table, one chair, and some lamps were  donated by friends. Sawdust was used  for  flooring;  kerosene  lamps were  mounted on posts as a source of light.  The walls of  the building were  re moved, and this gave enough material  so that several seats could be built.  In 1913, the church moved to a new  site. A  small wooden structure was  built. Two charter members are sisters  Georgia Gutter Smith  and Mamie  Gutter Moss.  Rev.  Jesse Dillon was  the  first  pastor. Brother George Gutter was  the first deacon. Other pastors were  Rev. G.W. Holden, Rev. L.R. McEwen,  Rev.  James  Pittman,  Rev.  Hivey  Carson, and Rev. Walter Smith, who is  currently serving. Financial secretaries  included Brothers Jesse Allen, Willard  April 30, 1985  Ratliff, Sisters Cleo Allen, and Elsie  Qualls.  Newly ordained deacons are Earnest  Qualls, Sr., A.T. Smith, and Lawyer  Ratliff.  The first women  to serve on  the  Mothers' Board were Mrs. Frankey  Gutter and Mrs. Letha Buckles. Pres ently the church mothers include Mrs.  Cleo Allen, Mrs. Beatrice Holmes, and  Mrs. Georgia Smith. Mrs. Rennetta  Taylor presently serves as correspond ing secretary. Brother A.T. Smith is  the current treasurer.

It does not dovetail  into the amendment just accepted by  the Senate, the Durenberger amend ment.  ",1985
265,Senate,99,0.257,43,13,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, it is  very important that the Congress act  to legislate some reasonable rules re garding seller financing. If we don't  pass  some modifying  language  the  very punitive provisions of the Deficit  Reduction Act will go into effect July  1, 1985.  I don't think this would be  good for the economy and at the same  time I think it is unnecessary Govern ment intrusion into contractual rela tionships of buyers and sellers. I also  think  it undermines  the respect for  the tax system.  If Congress does nothing today, the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  provisions  become law. They force parties dealing  at arms-length  to negotiate  interest  rates that are equal to, or higher than,  commercial rates or else face adverse  tax consequences.  One of those tax consequences is to  perhaps end up paying income taxes  on what  I  call  phantom  interest  income.  If a person doesn't charge  enough interest, the IRS can impute  income  to him and make him pay  taxes on it even though there is no  income in his pocket. That is phantom  income and that is not right.  Seller-financing has become an  in creasingly popular alternative to com mercial financing.  In order  to make  the sale, sellers are often willing to ne gotiate  interest rates that are  lower  than  those  charged by  commercial  lenders. Realtors in my State tell me  that many  sales of property would  never occur without this ability to ne gotiate lower interest rates.  I am as concerned as anyone that  there may have been some abuses of  this provision. Proponents of stringent  imputed interest rules talk about tax  loopholes and tax free, tax sheltered  millionaires out there in business, the  implication being that seller financing  of real estate has somehow created a  whole  new  class  of millionaire  in  America.  I think the statistics confirm that to  the extent there has been abuse, it has  been on the really big deals.  I have  never heard it alleged that the family  selling their house because they have  outgrown  it, or are moving because  dad needs to find a new job someplace  else, are offering seller-financing be cause they think they are going to get  rich by abusing the tax code. It is just  not the case. The same is true for a  farmer or rancher selling some of his  land. Sometimes people have to offer  seller financing or the alternative  is  ""no sale."" This same reality faces the  small businessman.  As chairman of the Budget Commit tee I am painfully aware of all  the  steps we take to try and keep interest  rates down, yet in the context of this  issue,  if we don't adopt  the Duren berger approach or the House bill, we  will be not only encouraging higher in terest rates for these transactions, we  will be requiring them.  I am going to vote for the Duren berger  amendment.  It  corrects  the  overzealous nature of last year's seller  financing provisions and mitigates the  impact which would have resulted.  For sales under $2 million the safe harbor rate would be 9 percent.  For sales between $2 and $4 million,  the first $2 million would be at 9 per cent and the rest would be at the ap plicable Federal rate. This results in a  blended rate.  For sales over $4 million, the entire  sale must be financed at the applicable  Federal rate. This is the so-called cliff  provision.  I don't like the cliff. For a rapidly  growing State like New Mexico, this $4  million ceiling is not good, however, it  is better than the House version and it  is better than the provisions  in the  Deficit Reduction Act. Treasury offi cials tell me it is the best we can do  without losing a  tremendous amount  of tax revenue.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1985
266,Senate,99,0.115,108,13,Mr. DURENBERGER.," Mr. Presi dent, passing a long-term farm bill to  replace the expiring provis!ons of the  act before  the underlying 50year-old statutes take effect will make  the recent debate on aid to the Con tras look like a high school civics class  discussion. The fact of the matter is  that this year's debate on farm policy  will force Congress to make some very  difficult choices on the future of agri culture. Unfortunately for rural Amer ica, Congress' difficult  choices will  have painful  financial  ramifications  for our family farmers.  For  instance, conventional wisdom  holds  that  this  country  needs  a  market-oriented  farm  policy  if we  want to be competitive  in the inter national marketplace. A market-ori ented farm policy fits in nicely with  current  efforts  to  reduce  Federal  spending. But how  can  the  farmers who are technically insolvent,  the 109,000 farmers who are on the  verge of  insolvency and  other farmers who need some form of  debt restructuring, pay off their debts  with the lower loan rates and target  prices called for under every market oriented proposal? They cannot, and  that is why the Farm Credit Council  has come  to  the conclusion  that  it  needs authority to establish a federal ly chartered entity to purchase $10 bil lion in distressed fa:r.m assets.  So, Mr. President, it comes as no sur prise to this Senator that the House  and Senate Agriculture Committees  are having a hard time rewriting the  1981 farm bill. It is not easy fitting a  farm program into the numbers con tained  in  the Senate passed budget  resolution. It is not easy putting to gether a farm program which will take  America's farmers into the 21st centu ry. It is not easy designing a farm pro gram that will enable family farmers  to survive through next spring.

So I hope that  we do break that impasse and get back  to balancing the budget.

And that charge  is: Get the  Federal Government's financial house  in order.  Stephen J. Rogers, of Ann Arbor,  MI, writes: ""Our Government cannot  continue to borrow 23 cents for every  dollar  it spends. Every part of  the  Government must fully participate in  spending  reductions-including  the  Pentagon.""  In her  letter, Marjorie  Shannon, of Ann Arbor, says: ""I am a  widow and do not have a pension but I  approve  of  cutting my  benefits  if  things are cut fairly."" And Ann Arbor  residents  Michael  and  Katherine  O'Rear write: ""We believe all aspects  of Government programs must share  in required cutbacks, and all citizens  must expect to share the sacrifice. We  will support your efforts so  long as  fairness is maintained     .""  I'd like  to  thank my constituents.  Members and especially budget confer ees,  listen  to what  they're saying.  Their watchword  is  fairness. Their  charge: Reduce the deficit. Thank you.

268,House,99,-0.334,121,13,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, today I  join  with  my  colleague,  DENNIS  ECKART of Ohio, in introducing legisla tion to provide for a public offering in  the sale of Conrail.  A year ago, I called upon the Secre tary of Transportation not to move on  a quick ""fire sale"" of Conrail to Nor folk Southern or any other private  bidder. Now we have on the table sev eral options, and I urge my colleagues  to  look at  the opportunity  that we  have to use a public offering to pre serve Conrail as an independent rail road for the Northeast and Midwest  regions of the country, a railroad that  is as profitable as the existing Conrail,  while still returning it to the private  sector.  In January of this year, I introduced  legislation  to provide for  this public  offering, but the legislation that we in troduced today is better. It consists of  the offering that was put together by  a number of investment groups and  announced last month.  Hopefully this legislation will be se riously considered by our Committee  on Energy and Commerce and brought  to the House floor as quickly as possi ble.  I believe that for jobs and for eco nomic development  in my State of  Pennsylvania  as well  as  the entire  older industrial region of the North east and Midwest, we need a viable  railroad, and I believe that the public  offering is our best option.  While I agree with the concept of a  public  offering  and  support  the  Morgan Stanley proposal as outlined  in the Eckart bill, some of the bill's  provisions need  to be expanded and  clarified. For example, I will work to  ensure that the primary repair facility  ",1985

271,House,99,0.398,134,13,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman,  I  think  that  the  Committee on Armed Services is being  described as assuming or taking a cer tain posture, which really we are re luctant to do, and I would like to make  a couple of points here.  I think that what the gentlewoman  from California is attempting to do is  commendable. I think that most of the  members of our committee would cer tainly support what she is attempting  to achieve. It is just that we have very  real reservations as to whether or not  what the language in the amendment  says would in fact achieve the purpose  that we would all like to see.  In talking with the Department of  Defense-not necessarily the contrac tors-they tell us that it is not work able for a number of reasons. One is  that the production quantities quite  often are small. We have a unique  need for a widget or whatever  that  goes on the aircraft or on a ship, or  whatever, and so you cannot go  into  the commercial run, as would normal ly be the case when somebody is going  into a commercial enterprise and when  one wants to compete and they say,  ""Hey, there's a need for this. We are  going to get into the business and we  are going to make a run and make so  many of these because we  feel  that  the market out there would absorb so  many of these items.""  0 1230  So  it  really  is not comparable  in  many, many  instances,  to what  the  needs and  the requirements of con tracting for  the Department of De fense to the commercial sector of the  country.  Second, many of the items that are  required by  the Department of De fense are very technically sophisticat ed and are not duplicated in the com mercial world. For that reason, you  cannot get a comparison.  Third, and I really would like to em phasize this, I would like all the Mem bers to be aware of this, there is not  one major weapons  system  that  is  being acquired for the Department of  Defense today that is manufactured at  the most economical  rate, not one.  You cannot name one, a ship or anti submarine warfare equipment or air craft, and the main reason is the Con gress.  We determine the rate of production  and we squeeze back and we stretch  out the production rate; so even if you  have information that the gentlewom an would require, it is really sort of  meaningless, because if you go to in dustry and say, ""Hey, what is the best  production rate, what would you nor mally expect this to cost per item?""  They say, ""Well, on a run of so and  so, it will cost this.""  Well, when  you  are  buying M-1  tanks or F-16 aircraft or whatever, F15's, for instance, we are spending, the  best estimate is, over $1 million perF15 aircraft over what we would have to  spend if we produced it at the most ec onomical rate.  Why do we not produce it at the  most  economical  rate? Because  the  Congress says  that we do not have  that much money, we will only fund it  up  to  this amount and they stretch  out the production rate and you get  them later and pay more for  them.  That is our problem. That is not the  contractor's fault, but we do that. We  do  that every year on most  every  major weapons system, the M-1 tank,  the F-16, the F-18, you name it. The  ",1985

Most conspicuous among  these  is  the vulnerable sitting duck  MX target missile.  As a result of this inexcusable waste,  we've had  troops  in Europe with  equipment of terrific quality, but con siderably less quantity than would be  desirable. This means there is greater  danger that we'd have to go nuclear to  repel  a Soviet  invasion of Western  Europe.  The Bennett-Fazio-Downey amend ment is an attempt to improve this sit uation. We take a billion dollars we've  saved on MX, and we put it into a bil lion  dollars' worth of  conventional  missiles,  ammunition, and so  forth.

280,House,99,0.07,212,13,Mr. FISH.," Mr.  Chairman,  the  amendment I am offering today will  bring to a close a matter of longstand ing concern to the Department of De fense,  the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point, and many Members of  Congress by establishing a section 6  arrangement for the education of high  school students residing at West Point.  For many years, the high school stu dents who live on West Point property  have attended high school in the local  community of Highland Falls. This  has afforded these individuals the op portunity to mix with students of non military families and to get involved in  extracurricular  interscholastic activi ties which would not be available at a  school composed solely of students of  military families at West Point. The  relationship between the local commu nity and the Academy has been very  cooperative over the years.  In 1981,  following  the cutbacks  in  impact aid made in the Reconciliation  Act,  the Highland Falls-Fort Mont gomery Central School District faced  a severe funding shortfall, which par ticularly affected the high school. In  November 1982, the situation became  so  critical  that  the Highland Falls  Board of Education sent out tuition  notices  to parents of students from  West Point then attending the high  school. The Justice Department sued  to block this action, and tensions rose  between the local residents and West  Point. In December 1982, I raised for  the  first  time on  the  floor of  the  House the distinctive problem of the  Highland Falls School District and the  funding problems it faced then and for  the future without additional appro priations for impact aid in general or a  specific  appropriation  for Highland  Falls.  As part of the continuing resolution  for fiscal year 1983, Congress approved  $200,000 for Highland Falls, paid out  of Defense Department funds to the  Department of Education and in turn  to Highland Falls. At this time, I first  began discussing with both  the De partment of Education and  the De partment of Defense the establisment  of a section 6 arrangement between  the Department of Defense and the  Highland Falls School District, among  other options.  In May of 1983, I met with then-Sec retary of Education Terrell Bell and  Assistant Secretary Lawrence Daven port to discuss the long-term solution  to the funding problems at Highland  Falls.  Secretary Bell  recommended  that his staff work with the Congress  and the Department of Defense to de velop a plan to resolve  this matter.  That same month, I appeared before  the House Appropriations Subcommit tee on Labor, Health and Human Serv ices, and Education to thank the chair man, Mr. NATCHER, and the ranking  minority member, Mr. CoNTE, for their  assistance in obtaining the release of  the $200,000 to Highland Falls, which  had been unduly delayed by the De partment of Education. In my testimo ny, I also cited the fact that the De partment had not responded positively  to  the chairman's letter  requesting  that they formulate a long-term solu tion to the funding situation.  Several alternatives were proposed  to  the Department of Education  in  May of 1983, including transferring a  grade from the section 6 elementary  school at West Point  to  the high  school in Highland Falls, which would  enable the school to become a super A  school under section 3 of the impact  aid statute; weighing high school at tendance more heavily than elementa ry school attendance, since West Point  students  only  attended  the  high  school; or changing the formula for  funding  section 2 and  section 3  so  those schools who received under, for  example, $25,000 per year, would be  eliminated from the program. All were  rejected  over  a  period  of  several  months.  In November of 1983, despite addi tional funding for impact aid in fiscal  year  1984, Highland Falls  faced  a  shortfall, this time over $300,000. In  April 1984,  I  requested  this amount  from the Labor, HHS, Education Ap propriations Subcommittee, which in cluded the funding in the fiscal year  1984 supplemental appropriation. The  Appropriations Committee report  in cluded  language  indicating  that  the  Department of Defense and the De partment of Education should cooper ate in solving the funding problem at  Highland Falls on a  long-term basis.  At  that time  the report signaled  it  would be the last time a specific ap propriation would  be  approved.  In  March of 1984,  the Highland Falls Fort Montgomery Central School offi cially requested a section 6 arrange ment with the Department of Defense  for educating the high school students  residing at West Point.  As  the end of the school year ap proaches on June 30, Highland Falls is  faced with a funding shortfall. Their  budget has been flat for several years,  the number of teachers has been re duced by more than 25 percent, and  property taxes are among the highest  in  the country. This  is  in an area  where more than 95 percent of the  land is owned by the Federal Govern ment or has been set aside as State  parkland. Approximately one-third of  the local community is senior citizens  living  on  fixed  incomes.  Property  wealth is well below the State average,  as is income per taxpayer. Even with  the high tax rates, average operating  expenditures are well below the State  average.  For the past 3 years, Highland Falls  has applied to the Department of Edu cation for section 3(d)(2)(B) emergen cy funding. Despite the obvious need,  they have been  turned down  each  year, including fiscal year 1985. Stud ies  indicate that Highland Falls has  the highest combined section 2 and  section 3 impaction in the country.  There  is  currently  a  shortfall of  some $300,000 in the school district's  budget. I have not asked the Appro priations Committee  for  additional  funds,  because  the Department  of  Education has had 3 years to resolve  this situation on a long-term basis, and  has responded negatively to inquiries  on behalf of the school district. The  available options, which are all disas trous, include locking out the student  ",1985

The battle itself was fought on  June 15, but in concordance with the  Gregorian calendar,  is celebrated on  June 28.  At the Battle of Kosovo, under the  leadership  of  Prince  Lazar,  about  25,000 patriots bravely fought to pre serve their religious beliefs and the in dependence of  their nation.

282,,99,0.203,290,13,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  the American consumer is, no doubt,  the most effective leverage an indus try has towards the implementation of  its own goals. We know, for example,  that consumers are willing to accept  change,  if change,  itself,  is coupled  with direct consumer benefits.  Based  on  this  assumption,  cam paigns for change invariable target the  consumer. As a matter of fact, most  campaigns, instigated by a particular  industry,  innundate  the  consumer  with potential benefits.

283,Senate,99,0.495,329,13,Mr. GARN.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate has spent a good deal of time  lately  agonizing  about why  Japan  seems to be having a hard time hear ing our message on the trade  issue.  When one stops  to  think about  however, the answer is simple: Based  it,  on past experience, they have nothing  to worry about.  The fact is that even when the most  grievous  trade  practices  have been  brought to light in the recent past, the  United States has simply rolled over. I  can think of no better example than  an issue on which I have spent a good  deal of time writing articles and letters  in  the past year-machine  tool  im ports.  Sixteen months ago-I  repeat,  16  months-the Secretary of Commerce,  with the support of the Secretary of  Defense, sent an urgent report to the  President concerning machine  tools.  Although the report is classified, I am  told it warns that machine  tool  im ports from Japan threaten the nation al security of this Nation.  That report, filed under the provi sions of section 232 of the Trade Act,  recommends that temporary limits be  placed on imports of machine tools in  certain  defense-sensitive  categories.  Let me emphasize,  this  is a  finding  based purely on a national defense  analysis  that our country  is endan gered by the current level of machine  tool  imports. That  is  not  a  light  matter.  Not  surprisingly,  as  soon  as  the  report was transmitted to the White  House,  lobbyists  for  Japan  began  crawling all over the place. While they  got nowhere on Capitol Hill, they ap parently  succeeded  at  the White  House where the issue had come to  rest.  There this recommendation has sat  for well over a year despite repeated  attempts by Members of Congress and  key Cabinet officers to get the issue to  the President.  I see the Senator from Missouri on  the floor, and I know he is familiar  with the situation on machine tools. I  remember that during the last Con gress, he and Senator Percy engaged  in a lengthy discussion on the issue on  the floor. They were,  I believe, at tempting  to prod  the White House  into some kind of action on the recom mendation of Secretary Baldrige. Per haps, Senator DANFORTH,  you were  being too subtle.  Apparently subtlety doesn't work, so  let me be blunt. The fact is that Japan  clearly feels it has nothing to lose con cerning the machine tool issue. I know  with certainty that key U.S. officials  have told Japanese officials and lobby ists flat out that they have nothing to  worry about-there is no intention of  getting this issue to the President for  his objective decision.

284,Senate,99,0.213,342,13,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to commend an individual  and an organization. Both have made  significant contributions to the cause  of finding a cure for Alzheimer's dis ease.  First, I salute Princess Yasmin Aga  Khan for her many personal efforts  not only in leading fundraising activi ties, but also  in making  the public  aware of this terrible disease. Yasmin's  mother, Rita Hayworth, suffers from  Alzheimer's and I can assure all the  Members of this body that Yasmin has  done much more than lend her famous  name to a cause. She has worked for  increased funding for research which  is so critical to our efforts to cure this  devastating disease. Yasmin has also  given her time and resources  in her  continuing effort to keep Members of  Congress  informed of  the need  for  Federal funding of Alzheimer's disease  research. I believe Yasmin has been in strumental in informing thousands of  Americans of the ever-growing cost of  caring for Alzheimer's patients and of  the most difficult burden  faced by  families caring for an individual who  suffers from this ailment. Yasmin has  watched  this  disease  overcome her  mother  and has been  a  leader  in  searching to find treatment for its vic tims.  Yasmin Khan has worked with an  important association known as  the  Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dis orders Association  [ADRDAJ.  This  outstanding organization has led the  way  for  increased understanding of  the disease, which affects an individ ual's memory, personality, and is the  fourth leading cause of death. I credit  the ADRDA for helping family mem bers of victims of Alzheimer's to work  with  researchers  and  professionals  dealing with the tragedies of this dis ease.  My mother  is  a member of  the  Siouxland Chapter  of ADRDA  in  South Dakota, and I can tell you from  personal experience that this fine or ganization  is extremely helpful and  supportive of the families of Alzhei mer's victims.  Alzheimer's disease  is  the  fourth  leading cause of death in the United  States today. Yet, so much is still un known about this disease. How do we  treat Alzheimer's? Is Alzheimer's pre ventable? Can we find a genetic trait  for this disease? These questions and  so many more  remain unanswered.  The  answers will  only  be  found  through continued research.  Through  the  efforts  of  Princess  Yasmin Aga Khan and members of  the Alzheimer's Disease and Related  Disorders Association, it is hoped that  we will be able to soon put an end to  this devastating disease.  I want  to  commend Princess Khan and all the  members of the ADRDA for their con tinued commitment  to  the cause of  finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease.  ",1985
285,Senate,99,-0.328,459,13,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1985
286,House,99,-0.354,472,13,Mr. FOLEY.," The President would  make that determination.  Mr. McCURDY. He could make that  determination and would not have to  ""consult"" with  the Congress? The  reason I  raise this is that this is an  item that has been raised continuously  on this floor and in the press, and the  United States has  said  consistently  that the introduction of Mig's or fight er aircraft into Nicaragua is a very se rious step and  that we  feel  that  is  threatening, and we would not accept  that. I wanted to enunciate or get that  statement from the gentleman in the  well.  I wanted to restate that even though  I  do  have  reservations  about  this  action. Last year it ended up being a  sense of the Congress, and I think this  is generally a sense of the Congress.  And if I had not received the Presi dent's letter only 2 or 3 weeks ago that  indicated that the policy vis-a-vis Nica ragua is for a political settlement in  the region, as it is in El Salvador, it is  not a military solution, that we are not  intending on introducing U.S. military  forces into Nicaragua, and it is not our  intention  to overthrow  the Govern ment of Nicaragua, and that this has  been a clear statement of policy by the  administration, and I think supported  by the Congress. I think we have had  a broad, general bipartisan statement  that that is indeed our policy.  Even though this may be redundant,  and in my opinion maybe even unnec essary, I think if the gentleman's ex ceptions are stated as he has indicated,  then perhaps there is no harm in the  gentleman's amendment.  I  am not  sure it is the best policy but I think as  a sense of the Congress that if these  statements are restated and they are a  restatement  of  current  American  policy, then I would have less concern  about the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back to the gentleman.  ",1985

I am one of those who ex ercise a great deal of discretion and do  not indulge in irrelevant and unneces sary debate. But there are some issues  that are very important to us and this  is one and, Mr. Chairman, I just want  to say if I cannot be given more than 3  minutes there  is no need for me to  continue.  ",1985
290,House,99,-0.104,524,13,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment I am offering this after noon has two objectives: One, it would  establish a requirement for annual re ports to the Congress regarding the  actual cost savings achieved through  contracting-out of services within the  Department of Defense; and  two,  it  would establish a  higher and more  conservative standard for converting  in-house services to the private sector.  The purposes of my amendment are  straightforward. First,  by  requiring  annual reports to the Congress con cerning  the  relative effectiveness of  contracting-out in the Department, we  will be in a much better position to  evaluate this program over the next  several years.  Our experience with contracting-out  in DOD over the last several years has  been mixed at best. The most recent  evidence we have that may be used to  evaluate this program is an April 15,  1985, GAO report. The audit covered  20 functions converted to contractor  operation between 1978 and 1981.  The major  conclusions  from  this  cost data are: First, overall estimated  savings of nearly $14 million was re duced to about $2 million; and second,  the estimated savings of 42 percent  was reduced to 7 percent over the 3year period, equaling 2.3 percent per  year.  To address this concern, the second  part of my amendment would increase  the cost-differential used for convert ing in-house functions to the private  sector  from  the  current 10-percent  level to 15 percent. This is the same  threshold used by the Veterans' Ad ministration.  With 115,000 civil service jobs under  review for possible conversion by fiscal  year 1988, I strongly recommend this  more conservative approach to spend ing taxpayer's dollars. I urge the adop tion of my amendment.  ",1985

318,,99,-0.37,654,13,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  the  situation in South Korea demands our  attention and concern. The Chun Doo  Hwan  government  currently  allows  little power to the National Assembly,  and has not accepted the opposition  party's call for a constitutional amend ment  allowing  direct  elections  for  President. Kim Dae Jung and other  important opposition leaders continue  to experience constraints on their ac tivities. Disturbingly, the recent pro tests against these policies have taken  on an increasingly anti-American tone.  With 40,000 troops stationed in Korea  and a  long history of friendship be tween our two countries,  the United  States has an important role to play in  this crucial time.  To fully understand the current situ ation  in South Korea,  I  submit  a  recent article from the Evening Sun  written by Stanley A. Blumberg.  The article follows:  [From the Evening Sun, June 17, 19851  OPPRESSION IN KOREA  <By Stanley A. Blumberg)  SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA.-There is little dif ference between leftand right-wing dicta torships. The  left espouses a philosophy  that decries the exploitation of man by man  and  sets  forth  lofty moral goals  to be  achieved by centralizing the means of pro duction in an all-powerful state. The right  makes the government the ally of dominant,  self-aggrandizing private economic interests.  For  the common citizen,  the effects are  often the same, or, to paraphrase Gertrude  Stein: a dictatorship is a dictatorship is a  dictatorship.  This is easy to understand. For both right  and left dictatorships are without oversight  by an opposition party and have no fear  that a free press might expose corruption  and oppression.  There are many similarities between the  Soviet Union and South Korea. Moscow has  the dreaded KGB, while Seoul nurtures its  counterpart, the Korean CIA. Both organi zations are subject only to the will and di rection of their respective dictators. These  intelligence agencies  routinely arrest,  jail  and torture citizens who have the courage  to attempt to speak out against the excesses  of the regime.  Thought control is a common element in  both countries. Hitler shocked  the world  when he ordered that ""unacceptable"" books  be burned. And yet  there  is  little public  outcry when Seoul and Moscow confiscate  and ban ""undesirable"" books and periodi cals.  ""I do not wish to alarm you,"" my Korean  friend said, ""but from the time you arrive at  the Seoul airport you may expect to be fol lowed. The phone in your hotel room will be  tapped and your luggage could be searched  during your absence.""  Attempts at thought control and media  censorship have been a constant ingredient  in Korean President Chun Doo Hwan's ef forts to maintain his dictatorship. In 1980,  ",1985
319,,99,-0.023,680,13,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to introduce once again a reso lution to designate a week for the rec ognition of a most serious and debili tating disease. This resolution will set  aside the week of October 6 through  October  12,  1985  as  ""Myasthenia  Gravis Awareness Week."" Last year  many of the Members of this body ap proved  this  resolution, and  I would  urge them to support me in this effort  again this year.  Myasthenia Gravis, also known as  Erb-Goldfam disease, is a neuromuscu lar disease which affects people of  both sexes, all ages and races. There  are currently over 100,000 victims in  America. The disease affects the syn apse-the gap which conducts the elec trical current from the nerve to the  muscle-and is  literally a breakdown  in communication.  Myasthenia Gravis is a very unpre dictable disease which can strike any  area of the body at any  time. It is  often misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue,  which allows the disease  to progress  until the victim  is  in severe danger.  Until  recently, Myasthenia Gravis  proved to be fatal for 85 percent of its  victims. There is still no prevention or  cure,  but  there  has  been  great  progress in research.  By establishing ""Myasthenia Gravis  Awareness Week,"" Congress will be  calling attention to the problems vic tims face daily. Hopefully by stimulat ing interest in this disease, there will  be  increased  research which would  lead to a better understanding of this  disease and eventually a cure.  Over the years our Nation has been  very  successful  in  conquering  or  making progress to conquer many terJune 27, 1985  rible diseases; it is resolutions such as  this that have greatly aided in these  successes.  I hope that all of my colleagues will  join me in approving this resolution.   NONEXISTENCE  OF  FEDERAL  RESERVED WATER RIGHTS  IN  WILDERNESS AREAS  HON. MICHAEL L. (MIKE) STRANG  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 27, 1985   ",1985
320,,99,0.465,680,13,Mr. STRANG.," Mr. Speaker, on a  prior occasion,  I  submitted  for  the  record and for the benefit of my col leagues, my concerns about the con tention that the designation of wilder ness areas on Federal public lands car ries with it additional Federal reserved  water rights. My previous comments  urged my colleagues  to  take a close  look  at  this  issue  because States'  rights and water are  so  crucial  to  those of us from Western States. Obvi ously, I do not believe any such addi tional Federal  reserved water  rights  exist in wilderness areas. That point of  view is now supported by the Colorado  Water Congress, an organization of  professional  water  officials  from  throughout Colorado.  Earlier this year, I asked the Colora do Water Congress  to  look  into the  issue of alleged Federal reserved water  rights in wilderness areas. The conclu sion of  the Water Congress  states  that:       we cannot support additional wilder ness designations in Colorado, unless such  legislation contains an explicit declaration  that wilderness designation has not created  implied Federal  reserved water  rights  in  Colorado.  I offer the attached summary of the  Colorado Water Congress findings for  the further benefit of other Members  who are in the position of considering  wilderness  designations  for  their  States.  The material follows:  WILDERNESS  FEDERAL  RESERVED  WATER  RIGHTS: THEY Do NOT EXIST AND THE As SERTION THAT THEY Do Is AN OBSTACLE TO  ADDITIONAL WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS  IN  COLORADO  <Opinion submitted by Colorado Water  Congress, June 11, 1985)  PREFACE  On June 10, 1985,  the Colorado Water  Congress passed a  resolution which stated  in part:  ""Now,  therefore, be it resolved, That it is  the consensus of the Colorado Water Con gress  that wilderness  legislation covering  any area in Colorado should not be passed  unless it contains adequate safeguards for  present and future development of Colorado  water resources.

321,,99,-0.396,706,13,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing,  with my distinguished colleague from  California, CARLOS MOORHEAD, and my  distinguished colleagues, a bill to pro vide a much needed solution to  the  problem of home audio  taping-the  Home Audio Recording Act. Home  taping of music is currently the single  greatest  threat  to America's music  community.  Our bill would accomplish two fun damental goals. First, it would exempt  from copyright liability those individ uals who engage in audio recording for  their private use. Second, the bill es tablishes a system of compensation for  creators and owners of copyrighted  material for the use of their creative  property.  The  accomplishment  of  these goals is crucial to the continued  vitality  of  the music  industy  and  indeed the entire creative process in  our country.  Mr. Speaker, the economic harm ex perienced by the music and recording  industries as a direct result of home  music  taping  in  recent years  is  as tounding. Over the past several years,  the amount of home audio taping has  increased  dramatically.  Recent  ad vances in audio taping technology and  the increased availability of inexpen sive, easy-to-operate, high-quality re cording devices have lead to virtual ex plosion of audio home taping.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Indeed,  the home  taping problem  has become so widespread that music  taping  is  actually  replacing music  buying. A  recent  survey  of  tapers  across the United States revealed that  in 1984 alone consumers would have  purchased an additional 325 million  albums and prerecorded tapes if they  had not been able  to  tape  them at  home.  The recording business is exceeding ly risky: 84 percent of records released  fail to even cover their costs. Record  companies rely on the revenues from  the occasional hit to subsidize releases  that fail to break even and to finance  new recordings by unknown artists.  Home taping siphons off the reve nues  that have  traditionally spured  the musical arts community to put its  labor and money at risk. The creative  and capital  investments  fostered by  our copyright system have brought  consumers a dazzling variety of musi cal offerings from which to choose and  enabled the American music industry  to set  the standard  for  the world.  Unless we ensure that the fruits of our  copyright system are not destroyed by  the growing practice of audio home  taping,  there ultimately will be  less  music for consumers to tape.  Thus, Mr. Speaker, it is in the con sumer's long-term best interest to es tablish a fair and reasonable system of  compensation to the creator, in order  to ensure continued public access  to  the widest possible diversity of cre ative works.  The element of compensation is also  critical because compensation for the  use of  intellectual property  is,  and  always has been, a necessary incentive  for  its creation. Society as a whole  benefits  because  compensation  to  copyright owners for their work pro vides  the impetus for  the continued  creation  of  intellectual work. The  basic premise of our copyright system  is that the payment of royalties serves  as both a  reward  for  the creator's  labor and an incentive to future crea tivity.  We must not abandon two centuries  of copyright doctrine just because the  complexities of a new technology chal lenge our ingenuity. It is a depressing  prospect to imagine a future devoid of  cultural diversity and experimentation  because we failed to act responsibly to  preserve  the  legal  foundation  on  which America's music  community  sustains itself financially. Our bill is  specifically designed  to prevent  this  from happening.  The Home Audio Recording Act,  which we are introducing today, would  provide the needed compromise solu tion  to  the home  taping  problem.  First,  it would exempt home audio  tapers  from  copyright  liability,  by  making it clear that individuals who  tape music for their private use would  not be  liable for copyright  infringe ment.  June 27, 1985  Next, the legislation specifies a roy alty on blank audio tapes and audio re cording equipment which would com pensate the creators and producers of  home taped music. The legislation re quires that the manufacturers and im porters of blank audio tape pay a one time royalty of 1 cent per minute of  playing  time.  For  audio  recording  equipment, the manufacturers and im porters would pay a one-time royalty  of 10 percent of the wholesale price.  Producers of dual cassette recorders machines designed specifically  to fa cilitate  the copying of music-would  pay a special, higher royalty of 25 per cent of the wholesale price.  These  royalties would be collected  by the Copyright Office and deposited  in a  royalty pool for distribution  to  copyright owners.  The use of the Copyright Office in stead of the Copyright Royalty Tribu nal is not intended in any way to make  a statement about the CRT's perform ance. That issue is currently being ex plored  separately  by  the  Judiciary  Committee's Subcommittee on Courts,  Civil Liberties and the Administration  of Justice, of which I am a member.  Rather, this transfer of functions  to  the Copyright Office has been includ ed in our legistation simply to indicate  that the bill can go forward independ ent of the CRT. Should Congress de velop an alternative mechanism  for  functions now being performed by the  tribunal, it would be a simple matter  to revise our legislation to incorporate  those changes.  Our legislation also contains provi sions designed to protect from paying  royalties  those persons who do not  tape  copyrighted music. Tapes  and  equipment used primarily for nonmu sic purposes,  such as dictation ma chines, would be exempt from the roy alty altogether. The Copyright Office  would be authorized to designate addi tional kinds of  tapes and  recording  equipment  for exemption. Organiza tions that us blank tapes for nonmusic  recording,  such  as  broadcasters  or  service groups for the blind and dis abled, would be able to purchase blank  tapes and equipment without paying  any royalties.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to  emphasize  that our  legislation per tains only to audio  taping. I do not  intend for this legislation to serve as a  vehicle  for  amendments  addressing  the video home taping problem or the  video first sale issue. It is my under standing that representatives of  the  motion picture industry do not intend  to pursue such legislative intitiatives  in this Congress.  I hope  that my colleagues  in  the  House will support our bill. It ensures  that the public will be able to tape for  private use, without risk of copyright  infringement  liability,  that manufac turers and importers will be able  to  ",1985
322,,99,0.287,719,13,Mr. PARRIS.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  weekend former students of Hammond  High School in Alexandria, VA, will be  celebrating the reunion of the class of  1965. In the 20 years that have passed  since more than 600 students of this  class walked across the stage to receive  their high school diplomas, both the  students and  the city  they  lived  in  have changed dramatically.  The past two decades have seen are newal of the rich heritage of a pros perous port city founded by Scottish  merchants in 1749. From the recently  rennovated  Torpedo  Factory  Art  Center on the revitalized waterfront in  the eastern part of  the city  to  the  commercial  and  residential  develop ment of western Alexandria, there are  more  than  1,000  landmarks which  remind us of  the people who have  helped Alexandria grow for more than  two centuries.  The Hammond High School Class of  1965 has continued  the  tradition of  contributing to this community, by es tablishing a college scholarship fund  for graduating high school students  who show strong leadership qualities,  and by setting up a memorial fund for  Alexandria Hospital. These 20 years,  however,  have  not  passed without  sorrow.  Last  year,  the  class was  shocked by the tragic murder of their  class president, Dr. Robert Rixey. In  his memory, the class is contributing  over $1,000 to the Rixey Foundation, a  memorial scholarship fund for college bound students.  The  contributions  this  class  has  made are a tribute to the vibrant spirit  that has helped the city of Alexandria  flourish, and  I am grateful  for  the  commitment and assistance they have  provided to others in their communi ty.e  TRIBUTE TO GEORGE  MAVROMATIS  HON. DOUGLAS APPLEGATE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  OF OHIO  Thursday, June 27, 1985  e ",1985
323,,99,-0.106,719,13,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  bring  to  the  attention of my  colEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  leagues a man who has served his com munity for 40 years, George Mavroma tis will be retiring from his position  this summer as chief of police in his  hometown of Steubenville, OH. He has  touched many lives during his years of  service and has been an exceptional  leader to the residents of Steubenville.  Chief Mavormatis is a former World  War  II marine who  served  in  Iwo  Jima. He was  awarded  the Bronze  Battle Star and the Pacific Operations  Theatre Award. After the war he re turned to Steubenville and joined the  police force.  Chief Mavromatis walked  a  beat  then when he first  joined the force  and soon came  to know  the people  who resided on it. Because of this close  association, he was able to help many  young people who were headed for a  life of crime, which to him is worth  more than any medal a police officer  may be awarded during his lifetime.  The chief has never been afraid of  the consequences in lending a helping  hand to those in need around him. He  cares about his fellow officers' protec tion and safety as much as his own.  Due to his close association with the  people he  serves, Chief Mavromatis  has never had to fire his gun in the  line of duty in the 40 years that he  has been a police officer.  In addition  to  the protection  the  chief has given to his community, he  has also assisted  in establishing the  Steubenville Little League  and  the  Babe Ruth baseball programs. He has  received honors from the Knights of  Columbus and as the College of Steu benville's  first Alumni Outstanding  Citizenship Award. He was also  the  Fraternal Order of Police's ""Man of  the Year.""  Mr. Speaker, Chief George Mavro matis is an exceptional human being  who has served as an example of law  and order for 40 years and will be pro fessionally missed by the community  of Steubenville.  So, Mr. Speaker, this entry into the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  is but a small  recognition of a man for whom I have  great respect and admiration for the  love, dedication, and commitment he  gave to his community. Best wishes in  all your future endeavors, Chief.e  BREAKDOWN OF CONFERENCE  TALKS  HON. JIM ROSS LIGHTFOOT  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 27, 1985  e ",1985
324,,99,0.391,719,13,Mr. LIGHTFOOT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to indicate my disappoint ment in the breakdown of the House Senate budget conference committee.  Mounting Federal  deficits must  be  dealt with quickly and fairly; however,  not at the expense of the Nation's 36  17991  million elderly retired persons. There fore, I implore the conferees to come  to an agreement without  tampering  with  cost-of-living  adjustments  for  Federal pension programs.  I think of many colleagues have for gotten or have failed to consider a few  things. For instance, just a short while  ago senior citizens were asked to take  a permanent cut  in Social Security  benefits when the COLA was delayed  for 6 months in 1983. This was sold to  the senior citizens as a necessary in gredient in ensuring the solvency of  the Social Security system. The senior  citizens accepted this delay and now  Social Security is experiencing a sur plus.  This surplus brings me  to another  point. At this time, we have no reason  to delay or reduce COLA's. The Social  Security trust fund is amassing a large  surplus. In fact, by 1990, according to  the Congressional Budget Office, the  Social Security trust fund under cur rent  economic  projections will  be  about $54 billion and growing. Besides,  the Social Security trust fund, which  is financed by employee and employer  payroll  taxes,  is not contributing  to  the Federal budget deficit. It is a self financing system with  its own  trust  fund.  Finally, and most important, the el derly depend heavily on Social Securi ty-two-thirds  get more  than  half  their income from  the program and  about one-third get more than 90 per cent of their income from Social Secu rity. Delaying or cutting the COLA's  would push over 200,000 senior citizens  below  the poverty  line. Tampering  with their COLA's would force many  senior citizens to chose between food  and  medicine,  a  situation  which  should not happen.  Last year, Social Security was great ly debated. President Reagan said he  would ""never"" cut or reduce Social Se curity benefits, yet he is considering it.  The Republican Party's platform also  pledged ""that we will adequately pro vide  for  them during  their golden  years so they can continue to enjoy  our country's high standard of living,  which their labors helped to provide.""  Yet, many of my counterparts in the  Senate are adamantly  insisting on a  COLA freeze.  I believe that the House Republicans  should stand up and let their Senate  counterparts know that we do not sup port a COLA freeze. The Senate Re publican  budget  conferees  are  not  speaking for many of us Republicans  in  the House when  they call  for a  COLA freeze. I implore the conference  committee to get back together and re solve the differences without tamper ing with Social Security-for the sake  of our Nation's seniors and for  the  sake of our children and grandchil dren who will be strapped with  this  ",1985
325,House,99,-0.295,758,13,Mr. GUARINI.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, as the sponsor  of H.R. 2672  I am pleased that the  House is now considering this bill to  correct a serious injustice to the State  of New Jersey and to increase public  consciousness of  the great need  to  ensure safety in the workplace. H.R.  2672 would redesignate the New York  Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center,  in  Jersey City, NJ, as the ""New Jersey  International and Bulk Mail Center.""  It would also dedicate the street lead ing into the facility to the memory of  Michael McDermott, a former postal  employee who lost his life in a tragic  industrial accident there.  I have offered this legislation in the  three previous Congresses. In the 97th  Congress, the House passed this meas ure by unanimous consent after the  Public Works and Transporation Com mittee reported the bill favorably in a  unanimous  expression of bipartisan  support.  Unfortunately,  time  con straints prevented the Senate's consid eration of  the bill before  they ad journed.  In  the 98th Congress,  the  House  again passed  the bill under  unanimous consent and  the Senate  passed an  amended version of  the  House bill. The House did not have a  chance  to act on  the amended bill  prior to adjournment. On June 26 of  this  year,  the Committee on Post  Office and Civil Service favorably re ported H.R. 2672. Its language reflects  extensive consultation between Mem bers of  the House and  the Senate  along with the guidance of the U.S.  Postal Service.  As I previously mentioned, this Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center is located in  Jersey City, NJ. For many years it has  been located there and has well served  both northern New Jersey and New  York. Yet oddly enough, although the  center is in New Jersey, we have con tinued to refer to it as the New York  Bulk and Foreign Mail Center.  This practice has been going on for  years and I see no justifiable reason to  continue  to misidentify  this center.  For  too  long New  Jersey has been  looked upon as merely a  suburb of  New York. It is time for us to acknowl edge the fact that this postal facility is  clearly  located  in New  Jersey  and  rightfully designate  it  as  the New  Jersey  International and Bulk Mail  Center. We must allow New Jerseyans  to be proud of being home to the larg est bulk mail facility  in the Nation.  New  Jersey  residents have  another  reason  to  take pride  in  their great  State.  My bill would also designate a por tion of  the roadway  leading  to  the  bulk mail center as ""Michael McDer mott Place."" For those of you who are  not familiar with the story of Michael  McDermott, I would like now to share  with you  the reasons for dedicating  this street to his memory.  Michael McDermott was a 25-year old employee at the New York Bulk  and Foreign Mail Center. On Decem ber 15, 1979, he tragically lost his life  when he became entangled in a faulty  conveyor. Safety devices which were  meant to prevent the kind of accident  which caused the death of this young  public servant had been removed to  speed the flow of mail at Christmas.  Designating a portion of this street  to the memory of Michael McDermott  will provide us with a monument sym bolizing  the sacrifice of all working  men and women who have lost their  lives in public service. It will be a con stant  reminder  to  the management  and the employees at the postal facili ty that safety in the workplace must  be a top priority.  This bill  to  redesignate  the bulk  mail facility  in Jersey City, NJ,  the  ""New Jersey International and Bulk  Mail Center"" and dedicate a portion of  the road leading into the center to the  memory of Michael McDermott would  help redress a grave  injustice to the  State of New Jersey.

329,House,99,-0.478,862,13,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, as we  commence debate today on the very  important foreign aid bill let us con sider for a moment an article in last  Saturday's Washington Post,  and  I  read: ""As U.N. Women's Decade Ends  African Wives Still Exploited, Men  Demand Pregnancies as Proof of Their  Virility.""  As we begin debate on this measure,  Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of  women in sub-Saharan Africa leading  lives of quiet desperation. Whatever  family planning services are available  to  them sometimes are miles away.  They cannot afford the cost of trans port and, in any event, their husbands  tend  to oppose  family planning be cause  from  a  traditional standpoint  they believe that large families are el oquent testimony to their virility.  So when we  talk  about UNFP A,  IPPF, the World Bank, the regional  development banks and our own AID  program, we have to remember that  the decisionmaking  that goes on  in  each of these African countries is an  absolutely  indispensable precondition  to making all the money, all the caring  and all the resources that the world  donor community is lavishing on sub Saharan Africa work successfully.  The African countries have to make  some hard decisions on improving the  status of women. They have got  to  make decisions to offer women equal  access to education, to jobs, to credit,  to increasing the age of marriage, lib erating  their women,  and making  women equal partners in life.  The  international  family planning  organizations must work together and  use all of their powers of persuasion to  encourage African chiefs of state to  make fundamental changes in society.  Family planning alone is not enough.  Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba  was a pioneer in the movement to im prove the status of women. In the late  1950's, Bourguiba used his office and  the media to educate his country on  the need to reduce population growth.  Bourguiba told his people that Tuni sia was a small, resource-poor country.  He also pointed out that men confused  virility with the number of children  they had and he sought  to change  male viewpoints on family life.  He urged men to reduce the number  of children  they fathered and ""Put  education  in  the head,  love  in  the  heart, food in the stomach, and shoes  on the feet."" Only then, he said, would  someone be a real man.  When other African nations follow  Bourguiba's lead then the contracep tive technology and the family plan ning clinics which the developed world  is offering  to  them will have some  impact and will be of assistance in im proving the quality of life in sub-Saha ran Africa, that most beleaguered of  all continents on Earth.

330,,99,-0.685,1005,13,Mr. DYMALLY.," Mr. Speaker, I re cently testified before the Subcommit tee on Postsecondary Education  re garding H.R. 2557. I wish to share my  testimony with  the Members of  the  House.  The testimony follows:  H.R. 2557  Mr. Chairman, distinguished colleagues of  the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa tion. I appear before you in support of H.R.  2557, a piece of legislation which I  intro duced, and which I hope will be included in  the Higher Education Act of 1985. The uni versity-high school partnership bill has the  capability of making significant impacts on  the quality of education which will be af forded to very special groups of nontradi tional students-the educationally disadvan taged, potential dropouts, pregnant adoles cents and teen parents, and the gifted and  talented students of this great and prosper ous nation of ours.  The Honorable Mario Biaggi, the distin guished gentleman from the 19th Congres sional District of New York, expressed ex tremely cogent remarks on the topic of non traditional students  in a  July 3rd article  which  appeared  in  ""The Chronicle  of  Higher Education."" Discussing his personal  education experience, Mr. Biaggi stated, ""In  some ways, I think maybe there's a greater  reason to support them <nontraditional stu dents> than the traditional."" And, while the  bulk of his text was geared to the adult stu dent, his logic for support of the nontradi tional student appropriately applies to large  numbers of special students for whom this  legislation was created.  The university-high  school partnership  bill will give support to partnerships by pro viding grants to institutions of higher edu cation and  local education agencies  that  have agreements to develop activities which  will enable secondary students to improve  their academic skills, to increase their op portunities to continue education after high  school, and to improve their prospects for  employment after high school. Businesses,  labor  organizations,  professional  associa tions,  community-based  organizations  or  public or private associations or agencies  may also sign onto the partnership agree ment.  The phenomenon of dropouts  (persons  who are not enrolled  in school and who  have not graduated from high school or re ceived the G.E.D. certificate> from our edu cational systems  is not a new one, and,  indeed, it is one which the Federal Govern ment at one time provided financial assist ance to a small number of school districts  for the purpose of preventing students from  dropping out of high school.  Today, however, Title VIII of the Elemen tary and Secondary Education Act  is no  longer authorized and some 16,000 school  districts of our Nation are faced with a 25  percent dropout rate for all students ninth  through 12th grade.  In its heyday <1969-1976> the Elementary  and S.econdary Education Amendments of  1967 <Public Law 90-247> was authorized to  make grants available to local educational  agencies for demonstration projects which  18277  were designed to prevent high school drop outs. These programs were located in rural  and urban areas which had a high percent age of children: ( 1 > from low income fami lies, and <2> that did not complete elementa ry or  secondary  schooling. The projects  were based on an analysis of why students  were dropping out and had to be approved  by the State Education Agency. Appropria tions  ranged  from $30,000,000  in 1969  to  $33,000,000 in 1976.  Title VIII-the dropout prevention pro gram-was authorized under section 807 of  the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act. For fiscal years 1969 and 1970, Con gress  appropriated  $5,000,000  annually.  These funds supported 10 projects. In 1971,  the  appropriation  was  increased  to  $10,000,000 and a  total of 19 projects was  supported.  The Title VIII projects followed many dif ferent strategies to reduce the dropout rate.  Some organized alternative schools,  learn ing centers and began work-study programs.  Others offered after-school programs and  summer camps. Still others established spe cial academic programs,  individualized  in struction, reading labs, community liaison  assistance, and teacher-student ""buddy"" sys tems.  However, none of these programs attempt ed to merge several approaches, and as a  result, none sought the goal of the universi ty-high school partnership bill-which is to  merge successful concepts and approaches  onto a total pattern of addressing the drop out rate.  A  recent  report by President Reagan's  Commission on Industrial Competitiveness  <A 30 member panel composed of business  leaders,  labor  leaders,  and  educators>  stressed two vital and extremely significant  points about our youth:  1. That the high school dropout rate in  our secondary schools is contributing to the  development of a growing, permanent un derclass in our society. Twenty-six percent  of all students enrolled in school dropout.  At  this  rate, our Nation  is producing  in  excess of 1 million dropouts annually. In ad dition, the dropout rate among minorities is  substantially higher-40 percent for black  Americans and 43  percent  for Hispanics.  One out of three of all American Indians  and Alaskan Natives  leaves school before  graduating.  2. New approaches are required to address  the problem of school dropouts and stem  this loss of human resources. National at tention must be focused on the severity of  the problem, and if the dropout rate contin ues to accelerate, part of an entire genera tion could be lost to the productive process es of creating workers for and contributors  to this society.  The overriding  recommendation of  the  Commission was for a national partnership  to be established between the Federal Gov ernment and the private sector to address  the dropout problem. The purpose of this  partnership would be to coordinate special  services in the school setting, and to give in tensive help to those students most at risk.  This legislation, the university-high school  partnership bill, specifically addresses this  recommendation and goes a step further by  providing an avenue of totally coordinated  educational services for high school drop outs which could be offered in a variety of  settings all of which would be academic.  In addition,  the university-high  school  partnership bill is based on a provision of  the children's survival bill <S. 1237), a com prehensive blueprint for Federal investment  ",1985
331,,99,-0.502,1018,13,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  management of our public lands and  reservations  is a  sacred  trust which  our Government must implement with  the utmost care and good conscience.  We have an obligation to nature and  to our children and grandchildren that  we do all that we can to preserve the  gentle balance of nature and take the  least intrusive action whenever man's  interests runs up against the balance  of nature.  I have great concern that the Feder al Government may have gone too far  recently in dealing with nature and in  the process destroyed that gentle bal ance.  Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the  Crane Reservation  in  Ipswich, MA.  This  reservation  is managed by  the  Department of the Interior. Recently,  the Fish and Wildlife Management  Office decided that deer had become  too plentiful  in  this area. The deer  had become too plentiful because man  has disrupted the natural habitat and  balance of nature. And because man  has caused that disruption, then man  has an obligation to correct that im balance in the least intrusive manner  possible.  Unfortunately,  the Office of Fish  and Wildlife Management  did  not  follow  this  principle.  Instead,  the  office chose to bring in a rifle sharp shooter to kill the deer on Crane Res ervation. This action was taken despite  protests by local citizens who thought  that the action was extreme. Further more,  the sharpshooter was enlisted  and the possibility of relocating the  deer was not explored adequately.  I raise this example of the slaughter  of deer on Crane Reservation to call  the attention of my colleagues to the  serious  responsibility  we  hold  to  manage  our  natural  resources.  In  order  to survive on  this planet, we  must coexist with nature, not rule it  and subject it to our every whim. Man  will  intrude on  the parameters of  nature;  that  is  to be expected. But  when we do so, there must be a com mitment to manage the resources in a  careful and compassionate manner.  In nature, we cannot rebuild  that  which we destroy. This principle must  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  guide all our actions. I regret to report  that this principle was violated on the  Crane Reservation in Ipswich, MA.e  DAN CRYSTAL, CIVIL  LIBERTARIAN  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

332,,99,-0.658,1018,13,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, for as  long as I have known him-and that  has been many years-Dan Crystal of  New Jersey has been an active and  tireless defender of civil liberties and  advocate for human rights. In recent  years, he has become an equally active  and tireless promoter of world peace,  serving as publicity chairman of Law yers for Nuclear Arms Control.  Dan was  recently honored by  the  Essex County branch of the National  Alliance Against Racist and Political  Repression  for his devotion  to  the  struggle  for  progressive  ideals  and  policies. Dan richly deserves this rec ognition,  and  I  applaud  the Essex  County branch of NAARPR for giving  Dan this award. Despite his many ac tivities, Dan finds  time  to write for,  and serve as associate editor of the Re porter, a publication of  the Passaic  County Bar Association. One of his  recent contributions to that publica tion  is a whimsical account of  this  year's Gridiron Dinner, which I am in serting at this point in the RECORD so  that my colleagues will have an oppor tunity to read and enjoy it.  GRIDIRON MADNESS  <By Daniel Crystal>  It comes on finally  to be spring, as my  good friend Damon Runyon, God rest his  soul, might have said, and I start getting vi sions of the magnolia trees flowering along  the Hackensack River which most certainly  ain't the purest stream in the world but  then I served in the Occupation Forces in  Europe after World War II and I can tell  you that the Beautiful Blue Danube ought  to be called the Big Muddy.  So spring fever hits me real bad, and I  start thinking about the Jersey Generals,  the New York Giants and the New York  Jets all of which teams play on different oc casions on the gridiron in Giant's Stadium  in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and a cab  from midtown will take you there in no time  along Route 3 which also passed Secaucus  which used to have the pig farms and what  with the scent of magnolias and of hogs get ting all mixed up in my memory and think ing of the Secaucus pig farms makes me  think also of the stables at the Meadow lands where I have often been given valua ble tips by the stable hands and those tips  can be very welcome indeed when the nags  start running and it's time to lay your bets  on which nag will wear the roses in the win ner's circle. And so, what with wondering  how good Phil Simms' arm will be  this  season in the NFL and how well Doug Flutie  is learning his signals with the Jersey Gen erals, I hop a cab to the Meadowlands and  have a good time exchanging greetings with  one and all and picking up whatever inside  July 9, 1985  information I can to have a  little edge in  laying my bets on football and basketball  and on the nags.  So after this welcome saying of hello and  how are you to my good friends and buddies  at the Meadowlands, I drop in at the boat  called  the Aratusa Supper Club,  that  is  moored there on the banks of the good old  Hackensack River right there in Secaucus,  New Jersey, on the Meadowlands Parkway,  to have a juicy steak and some chilled ale,  and who do I run into there at that seafar ing restaurant but my old friend, Joe the  Barrister, who  is a well known lawyer  in  those local parts and a big wheel, or so he  tells me,  in the lodge  that the barristers  have that they call the Passaic County Bar  Association.  So I make again with the hello's and how  are you's and what have you been up to and  who is the new doll in your life and all the  other chit chat that friends exchange when  they haven't seen each other for a long time  and Joe sits down with me and we both  order up juicy steaks and Joe fills me in on  how he is not only being a success in the  legal fraternity in New Jersey, but he has  also expanded his activities to get a piece of  the  action  in Washington, D.C., where  President Ronnie Reagan and  the other  pols hang out when they're not meeting at  Camp David or visiting Ronnie's ranch in  California.  Seems as if Joe now represents some com panies that got themselves into temporary  hot water with the Pentagon and the Air  Force what with charging more  than a  thousand bucks  for wrenches  that  they  order wholesale for $8.99 at a joint on Canal  Street and charging also nine hundred and  sixty nine bucks for a toilet seat cover that  they purchase for $5.73  from Sears Roe buck, Joe tells me also that he goes down to  Washington, D.C. as to try to smooth out  the ruffled feathers of the Pentagon and  the Air Force and while he is down there he  wangles two tickets to go  to the Gridiron  Dinner  that  the scribes who write  from  Washington run each year. The tickets are  $120 each which doesn't faze Joe who is bill ing it all to his clients anyhow and, besides  business is business, and who knows, he may  be able to talk to a general or an admiral at  the bar and put in a good word for one or  another of his clients with no animosity  about  the wrenches  and  the  toilet  seat  covers because everybody in the business is  doing the same thing and so will the gener als and the admirals when they retire and  start using their own connections to get a  job with some company they used to regu late.  So Joe calls up a doll he knows with whom  he  shacks up  sometimes when he  is  in  Washington, who is a secretary to a colonel  in the Air Force, and they dress up in their  fancy evening clothes and go to the Grid iron Dinner which is a special occasion this  time when it is held on March 23rd on a  Saturday evening on a very rainy night be cause it turns out that this is the hundredth  time  that  they have held  the Gridiron  Dinner and even the old pols in the District  of Columbia like Ronnie Reagan and Tip  O'Neill don't claim to go back that far.  So everybody who is anybody is there at  this hundredth running of the event and all  the faces you see on Hot Line or Meet the  Press are at the bar lapping it up and their  dolls are there too looking very pretty and  wearing dresses that cost enough to be a  worthwhile and very acceptable purse for a  big stake event.

336,House,99,-0.599,1213,13,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask the  gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCoL LUM] a couple of questions, because I  wonder  if he knows  that both  the  Committee on the Judiciary and the  Committee on Appropriations have au thorized the FBI to have this program  to  train United States and  foreign  police  officers  from  the Caribbean  area  in basic  criminal  investigative  matters. This  is an established pro gram that is in Puerto Rico, and the  name of  it  is  the Caribbean Police  School.  This has been offered twice during  1982, twice in 1983, and twice in 1984  for 4 weeks each. During the six ses sions, more than 80 police from 16 dif ferent foreign countries were trained.  I would  ask  the gentleman  from  Florida why his amendment is neces sary and what does it envisage?  Does the gentleman from Florida en visage hundreds of FBI agents going  down there and training people, or do  you have in mind increasing the scope  of the school that is already estab lished in Puerto Rico?  Mr. McCOLLUM. If the gentleman  will yield, I would be glad to explain  that this is more than training; but on  the training score, I envision that we  have the same kind of training being  given to the police forces that are in  those academies, but then some more  training, specifically conducive to the  conditions in El Salvador in fighting a  guerilla war, which requires, it seems  to me, a major thrust in-country, to  train those police forces.  Plus,  in addition  to the training and by the way, special  training on  human rights violations so they do not  do  that-plus  the equipping of  this  police force. As I said earlier, there are  only 22 vehicles the police force has  down there; they have no radios, no  radios in those cars; they cannot com municate. I envision providing some of  those.  I  envision us providing  them  with  better  handguns  and  normal  weapons  that they need  to use, be cause as I said earlier, we are talking  about a war in the cities that is incred ible; that is being fought down there  now, and unless we want to see the  military  forces move  into  the cities  down there, we are going to have to  have a police force that really knows  what  it is doing, and some  training  program in Puerto Rico is simply not  good enough; the Embassy and I have  been in contact about this; the State  Department and I have been in con tact about it, and since the June 19 sit uation they are really upset, and they  by no means think that the training  that you described is anywhere near  adequate, and certainly does not pro vide any equipment.

337,House,99,-0.133,1239,13,Mr. GLICKMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  join my colleagues  in  stressing the importance of continued  resolve in pursuing the release of the  remaining American hostages being  held in Beirut. Those seven-who have  been held longer and in more mystery  than the passengers on TWA flight  847-deserve the full commitment of  the Congress and the American people  in securing their release.  Among  the TWA hostages was  a  family from Hutchinson, KS: Bob and  Lou Peel, Bob, Jr., and Kristi. They  are home now, and I had the good for tune to spend some time with them  while I was in Kansas last week. Obvi ously, they are all relieved to be home  together again,  as was  their entire  community  thrilled  to  have  them  home. But  they have not forgotten  the fact that there are other hostages  still being held in Beirut, and I know  from our conversations that the Peels  very deeply want to see the other hos tages returned. I share their commit ment. Mter the TWA hostages were  taken, I posted a yellow ribbon on my  office door as a symbol of my hope  and resolve for their release. I intend  to keep that ribbon on my door until  the remaining seven are returned to  us, and I encourage each of my col leagues to do the same with the yellow  ribbons I sent them at that time.  Situations like those hostage takings  make it abundantly clear that we are  not living in ordinary times and that  we cannot expect ordinary means to  resolve conflicts and problems. Which  of us would have  thought  that  it  would be the Syrians who would be in strumental in securing the release of  the TWA hostages? They certainly  were not  an  obvious  choice. That  shows that we must pursue innovative  and creative diplomatic avenues in the  face of such terroristic acts. To do so, I  think the President would be well ad vised to proceed with appointments to  the Board of  the U.S.  Institute of  Peace which he was  statutorily  re quired to make by this past April 20.  The Institute is designed to encourage  research and training in the area of  conflict resolution. The authorization  is not large, but its potential for con tributing to resolution of such tense  situations-or better yet, their avoid ance-could be dramatic. The Institute  of Peace would not be a policymaking  entity, but it could very well spur cre ative thinking which would be benefi cial  to  those with policymaking  re sponsibilities.    ",1985

These  four  young marines were  taken from us by a barbaric act carried  out by terrorists who do not even have  the courage  to  identify  themselves.  Their cowardly act  resulted  in  the  tragic death of Cpl. Gregory Weber, of  my district in Cincinnati, OH.  My heart goes out to Mr. and Mrs.  John Weber who have lost their son,  and to the relatives and loved ones of  all the victims of this crime.  Such acts challenge our country's  will and our capacity to protect Ameri can citizens in sensitive areas of the  world.

For those of us from the Midwest,  where  agriculture and our  farmers,  small towns, and businesses are being  devastated by the present farm econo my, there is one necessary provision in  that farm bill. That is basically known  as the Bedell provision, named after  the gentleman from Iowa, BERKELEY  BEDELL, providing for a referendum for  a provision for a voluntary program  for the farmers that permits the farm ers to vote on the program itself.  That is  the only provision in that  farm bill  that will  provide  for  in creased income for our farmers in the  next 4 years. Without that provision,  farmers in the Midwest can look for ward to decreases in their net income.  They are being devastated right now  with  farm  prices  and  they  cannot  afford any lower farm prices.  So I ask all of my colleagues, when  the amendment which will be offered,  I understand, from the minority side  to delete that provision, that you sup port the Bedell p:i'Ovision and oppose  any amendment to strike it out.

340,,99,0.276,3,18,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week, a small town in my State effec tively lost representative government.  It was priced out of the market. When  its liability insurance coverage was ter minated, virtually all of the officials  resigned  from  office. They  simply  couldn't afford  to put their families  and careers at risk without some pro tection  from  the  flood  of  lawsuits  which are now a fact of life in govern ment units smaller than State size.  Unfortunately,  this  incident is nei ther unusual nor trivial. Other munici palities in my State are about to lose  their liability  insurance. In some  in stances,  this loss of protection could  mean the loss of police and fire protec tion for the citizens of the community.  In a society caught up in the frenzy  of  suing  everyone  for  everything,  members of police and  fire departments are unlikely  to perform  their  duties without a guarantee that they  will not be bankrupted by the costs of  litigation, let alone the amount of a  judgment.  The problem will soon enough be na tionwide, if it is not already so. It is a  Federal problem as well as a State  problem. Many  of  these  suits  are  founded on legislation passed in Con gress over the past few decades.

346,Senate,99,-0.163,120,18,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, when  the Committee on Environment and  Public Works reported S. 51, it recog nized that section 106 was an imper fect provision that would need addi tional attention. As reported, section  106  included  some  provisions  that  were designed to acquire information  to assess emissions and discharges of  hazardous substances to the environ ment and some provisions that were  designed  to  provide  information  to  emergency response authorities. This  combination tended to produce an un wieldy array of material for authori ties who needed something much sim pler.  The amendment the committee lead ership is introducing now replaces this  section with a more targeted inventory  of hazardous substances emissions and  discharges. Other amendments will ad dress the question of the information  and procedures to be required for an  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Re sponse Program.  A hazardous substances  inventory,  on a national scale, is a new and exten sive  undertaking.  Inventories  have  been used effectively by several States  for  regulatory purposes. A properly  constructed inventory can provide val uable  information  about  potential  emissions  that should be  regulated,  the effectiveness of regulations, and  trends in emissions over time. At issue  now is how to construct a national in ventory which  attempts  to balance  adequacy of information and the in herent demands on businesses that an  inventory poses when its uses are not  precisely  defined. This  amendment  changes several aspects of the commit tee bill to address this dilemma.  First, it limits the facilities subject  to the inventory to industries in the  manufacturing division of the stand ard industrial classification. These are  groups 20 through 39.

The  unveiling  of  the monument,  in scribed with the names of those who fell in  those conflicts, climaxed a 5-year effort on  the part of many individuals and groups to  erect a permanent reminder of the price  this community of 11,500 people paid  to  preserve America, its ideals and principles.  It would require far too much space to  list all who contributed to the memorial or  who participated in the dedication ceremo ny.

ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION  PRIVACY ACT OF 1985  HON. ROBERT W. KASTENMEIER  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 1985  ",1985
348,,99,-0.514,172,18,Mr. KASTENMEIER.," Mr. Speaker, when  Congress passed the wiretap law 1  in 1968,  there was a clear consensus that telephone  calls should be private. Earlier Congresses  had reached that same consensus regarding  mail and telegrams.  But in the almost 20 years since Congress  last addressed the issue of privacy of com munications  in a  comprehensive  fashion,  the  technologies of communication  and  interception have changed dramatically.  Today we have large-scale electronic mail  operations,  cellular  and  cordless  tele phones, paging devices, miniaturized trans mitters for radio surveillance, light-weight  compact television cameras for video sur veillance, and a dazzling array of digitized  information  networks which were  little  more than concepts two decades ago.  These new modes of communication have  outstripped  the  legal protection provided  under statutory definitions bound by old  technologies. The unfortunate result is that  the same technologies that hold such prom ise for the future also enhance the risk that  our communications will be intercepted by  either private parties or the Government. 2  Virtually every day the press reports on the  unauthorized  interception  of  electronic  communications  ranging  from  electronic  mail and cellular telephones to data trans missions between computers. The commu nications industry is sufficiently concerned  about this issue to have begun the process  of seeking protective  legislation. This bill  is, in large part, a response to these legiti mate business concerns.  Congress needs to act to ensure that the  new technological equivalents of telephone  calls, telegrams and mail are afforded the  same protection provided  to conventional  ' Title III of  the Omnibus Crime Control and  Safe Streets Act of 1968.  2 According to a soon to be released study of this  question by the Office of Technology Assessment,  Federal agencies are planning to use or already use  closed circuit TV surveillance (29 agencies>. radio  scanners (20 agencies>, cellular telephone intercep tion <6 agencies>. tracking devices <15 agencies>. pen  registers <14 agencies), and electronic mail intercep tions (6 agencies>. This increased use of a variety of  electronic surveillance devices alone is not cause for  alarm. There are instances when a particular elec tronic surveillance technique is necessary to com plete a criminal investigation, as my bill recognizes.  September 19, 1985  communications. The  situation we  face  today was clearly foreseen by Justice Bran deis in 1928 when he said:  Time works changes, brings into existence  new conditions and purposes. Therefore a  principle  to be vital must be capable of  wider application than the mischief which  gave it birth ...  The progress of science in furnishing the  government with means of espionage is not  likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may  some day be developed by which the govern ment, without removing papers from secret  drawers, can reproduce them in court, and  by which it will be enabled to expose to a  jury the most intimate occurrences of the  home.  The makers of our Constitution under took to secure conditions favorable  to the  pursuit of happiness. They recognized the  significance of man's spiritual nature, of his  feelings and of this intellect ... They con ferred as against the government the right  to be let alone-the most comprehensive of  rights and the right most valued by civilized  men.3  WHAT IS AT STAKE  Without legislation addressing the prob lems of electronic communications privacy,  emerging industries may be stifled. For ex ample,  recent court decisions concerning  cellular and cordless telephones leave a se rious question whether calls made over  those systems are truly private. Similarly  the current law with respect to the inter ception of digitized  information  over  a  common carrier telephone line is unclear.  This type of uncertainty may unnecessarily  discourage potential customers from using  such systems. More importantly this ambi guity may encourage unauthorized users to  obtain access to communications to which  they are not party.  In addition  to  the commercial disloca tions which may occur if we do not act to  protect the privacy of our citizens, we may  see the gradual erosion of a precious right.  Already the very same communication be tween two persons is subject to widely dis parate legal treatment depending on wheth er the message was carried by regular mail,  electronic mail, an analog phone line, a cel lular phone or some other form of elec tronic communication  system. This  tech nology-dependent legal approach does not  adequately  protect  personal  communica tions;  rather,  it  imperfectly affords  legal  protection  to communications carried by  some industries. Nor does this crazy quilt  of laws reflect the centrality of American's  privacy concerns. As  recent polls clearly  show, Americans care about privacy inter ests. 4 As one commentator put it:  Privacy  is not  just one possible means  among others to insure some other value,  but ... it is necessarily related to ends and  relations of the most fundamental sort: re spect, love, friendship and trust. Privacy is  not merely a good technique for furthering  3 Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 474  (1928> <Brandeis, J. dissenting>.

HERTEL  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 19, 1985  ",1985
350,Senate,99,-0.374,237,18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to urge my colleagues to support  S.  51,  legislation  reauthorizing  the  Hazardous Substance Response Trust  Fund or Superfund.  Senator  STAFFORD  and  the other  members of the Committee on Envi ronment and Public Works are to be  commended for their efforts to reau thorize  and  improve  our Nation's  system of responding to the problem  of hazardous waste.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency estimates that there are now  some 20,000 or more hazardous waste  sites in the United States. And that  number  is  growing every day. The  problem is enormous.  Critics charge that we  in Congress  often  respond  to problems of  such  magnitude with  a  pitchfork and  a  truck load of million dollar bills. Such  is not the case with Superfund.  Properly  disposing  of  hazardous  waste and cleaning up potentially dan gerous Superfund sites require careful ly and scientifically planned action.  Eliminating the threat to our environ ment by hazardous wastes is not a mis sion which money alone can accom plish.  Over the last 4 years Congress has  judiciously raised and spent $1.6 bil lion  to begin our national effort  to  identify  and  clean  up  hazardous  wastes. That money has been spent  not only on cleaning up specific sites,  but on developing methodologies and  practices  for  fighting  hazardous  wastes in the future.  On September 30, 1986, the author ity of Congress to raise revenues and  appropriate moneys to support Super fund will  expire. The Environment  and Public Works Committee and the  Senate Finance Committee have  reported the legislation which is before  us today to expand and improve the  Superfund.  Some $7.5 billion would be  raised  mainly through excise taxes to broad en our attack on hazardous waste. The  lessons of the last 4 years now enable  us to expand this campaign. New sci entific advances have been made. Su perfund is more efficient and the two  most  recent Administrators  of  the  EPA have told Congress that Super fund workers are ready to take on this  problem on a larger scale.  I doubt that there is one Member of  this body or of the House of Repre sentatives who does not support Su perfund, and who does not support in creasing its efforts, in light of the new  proficiency we have  in dealing with  hazardous wastes. There is some con sternation, however,  concerning  the  funding mechanism which the Senate  Finance Committee approved on May  23, 1985.  For the past 4 years, Superfund has  been financed,  in  large part, by an  excise tax on petrochemicals. Indeed,  the so-called feedstock tax on 42 desig nated chemicals has provided seven eighths of Superfund moneys  since  1981.  In May, the Environment and Public  Works Committee sent legislation to  the Finance Committee requiring that  $7.5 billion in revenues be raised over  the next 5 years to finance Superfund.  After  careful  consideration  and  debate, the Finance Committee recom mended  that  the  feedstocks  tax be  continued, and that a new tax on man ufacturers be imposed.  The manufacturers excise tax, which  would raise $5.4 billion, would be im posed at a rate of $8 for every $10,000  earned from the sale or lease of prop erty. This  tax would only apply  to  firms with  taxable receipts of more  than $5 million. There would be no tax  on exports and manufacturers would  be allowed to take a tax credit for the  amount by which the excise  tax  in creases the cost of their purchases.  In its report accompanying the Su perfund  legislation,  the Senate Fi nance Committee argued that the new  manufacturers excise tax would broad en the tax base which supports Super fund. Under current law only approxi mately 600 firms are footing the bill  for Superfund. Albeit, these firms are  some of the producers of hazardous  waste. Under the legislation before us,  some 32,000 firms would share the cost  of the expanded Superfund effort.  The business community has been  very critical of the Finance Commit tee's manufacturers excise tax, claim ing that it is a hidden value added tax.  The cost of Superfund, they say, will  ultimately be passed on to consumers  in the form of higher prices. In addi tion, they argue that the current feed stock tax only taxes those who direct ly  produce  potentially  hazardous  wastes, while the new manufacturers  tax would unfairly tax all larger firms.  Yet, the Finance Committee has in cluded provisions which allow Ameri can manufacturers to remain competi tive in the world economy, by exempt ing exports from the tax. Additionally,  no one industry in the chain of pro duction of a product would be forced  to bear the full burden of the excise  tax, because a tax credit will be made  available equal to the increased pur chase  price which  a manufacturer  must pay as a result of excise taxes im posed at earlier points in production.  I too have serious reservations about  value added taxes of any kind. But, I  have no doubts, whatsoever, about the  need to increase our efforts to clean  up hazardous wastes. I, for one, want  to make it clear that today I am cast ing my vote for Superfund, not for  value added taxes.  Any effort at this point to strike the  funding mechanism for Superfund ap proved by the Senate Finance Com mittee only serves to distract us from  our central purpose, which is to renew  and improve Superfund.  The battle over the funding mecha nism for Superfund was won or lost,  depending on your perspective, in the  Finance Committee. Any attempt now  to rewrite the tax aspects of the Su perfund legislation would cause an un necessarily protracted debate to occur.  If Superfund were not about to expire,  if the problem were not so immediate,  perhaps we could afford to hold such a  debate.  But, there is no time. The threat of  hazardous waste increases every day,  and we are doing all we can right now  to keep up with it. President John F.  Kennedy  understood  this  situation  well. In 1963 he wrote to Congress:  Actions deferred are all too often opportu nities lost, particularly in safeguarding our  natural resources.  I urge my colleagues to support and  approve with dispatch the Superfund  Improvement Act of 1985.  ",1985
351,Senate,99,0.52,263,18,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I rise  today, with the support of my distin guished colleague Senator BoREN,  to  introduce legislation that represents a  culmination of 5 year's work and nego tiation by six Oklahoma Indian Tribes.  legislation would complete  the  Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's intent  to arrange the transfer in trust of the  Chilocco Indian School lands to the  Cherokee Nation and the Five Tribes  of  the Pawnee Agency,  these  tribes  being  the  Kaw,  Otoe-Missouria,  Pawnee, Ponca, and Tonkawa Indian  Tribes of Oklahoma.  Under  Public  Law  the  Bureau of Indian Affairs was given the  authority to dispose of the Chilocco  Indian School  lands. Subsequently,  the associate solicitor for Indian af fairs determined the Public Law 93only  qualified  the  Cherokee  Nation of Oklahoma as transferee of  the Chilocco School lands. Therefore,  the associate solicitor determined, par titionment of the land by the Chero kee Nation to the Five Tribes of the  Pawnee Agency would violate the Non Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177). Ac cordingly, the purpose of this legisla tion is to authorize the United States  to hold the Chilocco School Lands in  trust for the Cherokee Nation of Okla homa  and  the Five Tribes of  the  Pawnee Agency. Furthermore,  it di vides the surface and mineral rights  according  to  the agreement reached  between the tribes.

My col leagues  have  taken  the  floor  this  morning to talk about this tragedy of  high magnitude.  Fortunately, reports that have come  in so far indicate that .American lives  have not been taken, with perhaps a  few injuries, and we are to be thankful  for that.  However, may I address the serious  problem  that  thousands  and  thou sands  of Mexican  citizens will  be  facing who have probably been killed  or injured in this tragedy of high mag nitude. Reports are that a third of the  city  has  been  devastated  and  the  subway is completed destroyed. And of  course the city's infrastructure is non functional.

",1985
356,House,99,0.122,289,18,Mrs. JOHNSON.," Mr. Speaker, part  of a comprehensive response to a large  U.S.  trade deficit must be to ensure  that American exporters can get com petitive  financing  for  overseas  projects. Our competitors are vigor ously supporting from 20 to as much  as 40 percent of their exports in the  scramble for major international con tracts while we support only about 3  percent of those deals.  The increasing foreign use of mixed  credits of official financing subsidies  has become a major problem for heavy  capital-intensive  industries  such  as  transportation,  aircraft,  powerplant  construction. The loss of foreign mar kets threatens jobs provided by thou sands  of  suppliers  throughout  our  Nation.  This problem has been identified by  every study of America's competitive ness  including  the President's Task  Force on International Enterprise. It  is a serious problem costing current  jobs but costing decades of loss, as we  cut ourselves out of the rich follow-on  market associated with  these export  sales.  The President's decision  to include  competitive  financing as part of his  approach to our current trade prob lems recognizes the importance of this  approach.  In the last session, I proposed a bill  on competitive financing and urge you  to join me in cosponsoring H.R. 3296,  also  supported and  cosponsored by  Representative BoNKER, the leader in  this mixed credit financing effort.

358,House,99,-0.245,315,18,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Chair man, I rise in support of the farm bill.  This bill is a  long way from what I  think American farmers need. It has  many shortcomings but it has some  strong points as well.  The commodity price support pro grams I feel are generally inadequate  in that they do not provide sufficient  mandatory  production  controls  or  price guarantees. However, the farmer  referendum  tied  to  the Voluntary  Marketing Certificate  Program  on  wheat and feed grains is a move in the  right direction. This program should  be expanded to other commodities.  I also support the compromise dairy  program and encourage my colleagues  to support it. The dairy proposal does  not please dairymen in all regions but  it is a true compromise, and I believe it  serves the interests of the industry as  a whole and will help ensure  that  American consumers will have a de pendable  supply of milk and dairy  products.  Further, I am extremely proud of  the resource conservation  title. This  package, which  includes a  conserva tion reserve, sodbuster and swampbus ter programs,  is probably  the most  comprehensive soil conservation pack age ever to come before the House.  I plan to support the bill. American  farmers are  in deep  trouble and we  must  keep  the  legislative  process  moving, attempting to improve the bill  where we can.

360,House,99,0.019,328,18,Mr. STENHOLM.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding me  this time.  I would say that today there  is a  growing awareness in America of the  importance of agriculture to our econ omy. Unfortunately,  there  are  no  short-term solutions to the problems  of agriculture. The challenge  to the  House Agriculture  Committee was  threefold: to v.Tite a farm bill, to deal  with  the  short-term  problems  of  having borrowed  $100  billion more  money than we farmers can pay back  with current income; second, to meet a  budget  requirement  imposed by  the  House and Senate conference on the  budget; and  third,  to provide  some  long-term hope of working ourselves  out of this dilemma we find ourselves  in.  We have met that budget challenge.  As tough as it has been, we have met  it. We could have used another $11 bil lion, as the Senate Agriculture Com mittee reported last night, but we do  not have it.  Unfortunately, we still have $150 bil lion deficits as far as the eye can see  and I submit we will never solve our  farm problem or our Nation's problem  until we solve our propensity to spend  more than we have as a nation.  Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 2100. I  encourage each and every one of you  also. Where our committee has been  split, we will allow the will of the ma jority  to work. Where you have an  idea to improve it, you will have an op portunity under an open rule to im prove this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2100 gives us  the tools necessary to begin working  our way out of the dilemma we find  ourselves in. It is a more logical basing  yields bill,  a more effective supply management program, clear title legis lation granting to innocent third-party  buyers the necessary protection they  need in this world today; a conserva tion  title you have heard so much  about, and I join with those who have  expressed their support for that.  I hope that each and every one of  you will join in opposing every farm  income weakening  amendment  that  comes on this floor. The dairy substi tute, the sugar substitute, the peanut  substitute, all will reduce farm income.  We do not have farm income to share.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge support for  the bill.  Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I  yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman  from South Dakota  [Mr.  DASCHLE], a very important member of  our committee.  ",1985
361,House,99,0.387,341,18,Mr. LEWIS of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  let me begin by commending Mr. DE LA  GARZA,  the chairman of the Agriculture  Committee, and Mr. MADIGAN, the ranking  Republican who have worked many  long  and oftentimes difficult hours to bring H.R.  2100  to the House floor. That has been a  thankless task and their efforts should be  duly noted as nothing short of heroic.  Mr. Chairman, I'm sure we can all agree  on the fact that this is not a perfect farm  bill. Members of the Agriculture Commit tee, other Members of this body, the admin istration, farmers, industry officials, econo mists-all have different views on how we  can improve the American farmer's plight.  As a matter of fact, I will work to have  some  of  the  provisions  in H.R.  2100  changed during the floor debate.  Now,  I don't doubt  that all our views  have merit. In fact, I would be the first to  say, ""Let's incorporate everyone's ideas,"" if  I thought that would work. The plain and  simple truth of the matter is, through little  fault of its own, the American farm com munity is in serious trouble. These troubles  can be attributed to many things; ineffec tive Government programs, high  interest  rates, a runaway Federal deficit, a danger ously high trade deficit-and the list goes  on and on.  No single piece of legislation can solve  all these evils. However, H.R. 2100 is a vehi cle, a good vehicle by which we can develop  an American farm program.  The farmers of this Nation are waiting  for us,  their elected officials  to provide  them with a window clear enough to give  our farmers a vision of what  the future  holds for them.  We have a challenge ahead of us. I hope  the Members of this body will meet it head  on.  We owe that to those who make up the  roots and  the  fiber of our Nation,  the  American farmer.  ",1985

363,Senate,99,-0.422,562,18,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, I want to  share with my colleagues an article  which appeared in the Rocky Moun tain News. It was written by a good  friend of mine, Morgan Smith, who  serves in Gov. Richard Lamm's admin istration as executive director of the  State department of local affairs.  If there are heroes in government,  Mr. President, surely they are often  found  in  the States. And  in  these  times,  they must  be  particularly  heroic. State officials are caught be tween the demands of federalism and  the challenges of our current econom ic difficulties.  On one hand, State officials are told  by the Federal Government they must  accept more  responsibilities  for pro grams, even as they are provided di minishing resources to finance them.  On the other hand, the crisis on the  farm, the declining competitiveness of  American  exports,  and  the  conse quences of inevitable economic change  have combined to place ever greater  demands on those very programs.  Different States face  that difficult  paradox in a variety of ways. In my  own State of Colorado, however, a gov ernment responsive  to  the needs of  the people has responded creatively.  The Colorado Department of Local  Affairs has listened with special care  to  the voices of people  in  the de pressed farming, mining, and energy  communities. The office has aggres sively sought new opportunities and  options for them to compete and suc ceed  in  this changing economy. By  helping  farmers  identify  new  and  more marketable crops, initiating part nerships among government, colleges,  and the private sector, and bringing  new businesses to the State, the de partment of local affairs has made a  real difference in the lives of Colorad ans.  Morgan Smith  is a good friend of  mine, Mr. President, but he is much  more. Morgan is an exceptional public  servant who has worked long and hard  for the people of my State. He is espe cially  sensitive  to  the  challenges  facing  hard-pressed  rural  communi ties. His comments, in an article titled  ""Small Towns Can't Wait for the Agri cultural Comeback,""  demonstrate  a  keen awareness of their problems and  his dedication to the search for help ful and effective answers. I urge all of  my colleagues  to  read his excellent  statement, which I ask to have printed  in the RECORD.  The material follows:  ",1985

375,House,99,-0.33,757,18,Mr. TRAXLER.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, sugar in the area of  the country that I come from is akin  to  the Bible,  and  this amendment  clearly is heresy. Sugar and a domestic  sugar program provides substance and  income to the American sugar growers,  the sugar farmers. I represent 2,000 of  them in my district, and it is the only  bright spot in their economic horizon;  it is  the only place where  they are  going to make any money this year.  Now, through this amendment, if you  force my growers out of production  and into other crops, you are going to  pay for  it through greater subsidies  for com and wheat. That is their alter native to beets. The land is not going  to stand idle.  The second point I want to make is  this: There are two points that I think  the authors of this amendment make.  First, that it is good for consumers. I  categorically deny that. That is false;  it is not true. Second, we ought to do  this for the benefit of the Caribbean  nations so they can make their pay ments to the Wall Street international  bankers. It is the first time I have ever  heard an argument on the floor of the  House that said, ""Hey, we want to in crease our trade deficit; it is good for  us:   That  is absurd. Absolutely  ridicu lous. I cannot believe a Member of this  House would stand on the floor and  make that suggestion. We do not need  to  increase our  foreign  trade debt,  which is now $130 billion. We need to  decrease  it. We do not need to buy  more overseas; we need to buy less. We  need to produce more in America.  Currently, nearly half of the sugar  that is consumed  in  this country  is  produced  in  this country. We  give  away almost half of  it; how much  more do you want? You  talk about  jobs, what are you going to do for the  1,000 people that work in my produc tion facilities? What are you handing  them besides an unemployment check?  What are you doing for the 2,000 farm  families who are making their mort gage payments. That  is  the human  side of this.  What about the consumer side? Do  you tell me that in the midseventies,  when the price of sugar went to all time highs of 75 cents a pound, fol lowed by a dramatic drop down to 9  cents a pound, that the price of candy.  or pop, or whatever dropped with it?  Are  the CEo s  of  those companies  paid to cut profits or are they paid to  make money?  I  leave  that for your  judgment. The fact of the matter is  the consumer did not benefit. The con sumer did not get the break when the  price dramatically dropped at  that  point in time.  What about other countries? The  Canadians pay their producers virtual ly  the same  thing as we pay ours.  They  subsidize  their  industry  the  same way we do. The reason they do  that is because they recognize the ben efit of having a domestic sweetener in dustry, and we have, and we do, and  we will.  What about Brazil? They set prices  related to production costs. Australia  has an import embargo;  local prices  are controlled. Thailand maintains a  domestic sugar price  five  times  the  world price. The European Economic  Community, boy, this is a good one.  They pay about 28 cents a pound to  their producers, and then they sell it  at the world price on the world market  to New York, and get this: What they  sell it for does not even pay them the  cost of transporting it from their stor age bins to the port.  How can we possibly compete?  In  conclusion. please reject the Downey Gradison amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from  New York [Mr. DOWNEY] and the gentle man from Ohio [Mr. GRADISON].  I want to urge all of our colleagues to  vote against this amendment and to sup port the House Agriculture Committee's po sition on the continuation of the sugar pro gram because it is the right thing to do.  The amendment's sponsors would have  us believe  that  if their amendment suc ceeds, sugar prices will come down for our  consumers,  the  free market will prevail,  and only a small number of people will be  hurt. All of these assertions are false, and I  want to tell you why.  First, the idea that sugar prices will come  down is based on the belief that commer cial sugar users will pass on the savings to  their customers. History tells us that this  ",1985
376,House,99,-0.004,796,18,Mr. HORTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise  in  opposition to the amendment offered by my  good friends and colleagues, Congressmen  OLIN and MICHEL. This amendment would  devastate the dairy industry in New York,  and all across the Nation.  New York State is the third largest pro ducer of dairy products in the country. In  1983, alone, 15,316 dairy farms sold $1,574  billion worth of milk. The bad news is that  the industry is in deep economic trouble.  More  than 34 percent of the New York  dairy  farms  operating during  1970,  no  longer exist.  Because the issues reflected in the 1985  farm bill hold such importance for dairy men in my State and across the country;  and because my State does not have repre sentation on the Agriculture Committee; I  have worked closely with  the committee  and  the  agriculture  community  in New  York to develop a proposal which would  reduce the dairy surplus, meet our budget  goals, and preserve our dairy  industry. I  spent a great deal of time analyzing the  various proposals and am convinced that  the committee title offers the best opportu nity for our farmers.  Recent debate on these proposals has fo cused on their expense to the Federal Gov ernment. I,  too, am concerned about the  budget deficit, but believe that this concern  must be weighed  against  the  impact of  these proposals on our  farmers. Simply  stated over the course of 3 years, the Olin Michel amendment will reduce farm cash  receipts by nearly 30 percent. This  isn't  right and it isn't fair.  The Agriculture Committee bill, which is  supported by a m~Qority of the farm groups  in my home State of New York, is not per fect. It contains some provisions that are  difficult to support. It does, however, offer  the best available option for reducing the  dairy surplus, meeting our budget goals,  and protecting our domestic dairy industry.  I urge my colleagues to join me in oppos ing this amendment and support the com mittee bill.  ",1985
377,House,99,-0.347,796,18,Mrs. LONG.," Mr. Chairman, I  stand  in  support of  the Olin-Michel  amendment.  The dairy farmers in the State of Louisiana  are adamantly opposed to one of the m~or  provisions of the dairy title: the diversion  program. The  implementation of a diver sion program is not the most direct and ef fective method to cut dairy production. We  should remove the incentive to overproduce  via meaningful cuts  in the price support  system. Why should farmers who have es tablished an efficient operation pay for the  inefficiencies in the dairy industry? There  are farmers in States, such as Louisiana,  that do not produce huge surpluses. They  are not willing to have their profit margins  taxed away through assessments or be a fi nancial burden on the Federal Government  at a  time when self-sufficiency  is needed.  Also, with the adoption of the current dairy  provisions, retail milk prices will increase  more than under the Olin-Michel amend ment. The higher milk prices  inherent in  the dairy title will result in increased costs  of the Food Stamp Program, the WIC Pro gram and Child Nutrition Programs. These  increased costs mean  fewer poor women  and children will be able to participate in  these  programs. Again,  I  urge my  col leagues to support the Olin-Michel amend ment.  0 1515  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Virginia [Mr. OLIN].

380,House,99,-0.267,809,18,Mr. DORGAN of North Dakota.," Mr.  Chairman, putting  together  a  farm  bill  under the current circumstances was not  easy. On one hand, we have a seriously de pressed farm economy. My own State of  North Dakota has  lost over 4,000  farms  since 1980. On the other, we are looking at  a bumper harvest of grain, which will, iron ically, further depress prices. The situation  is  the same  in  the dairy  industry. Dairy  ",1985
381,House,99,-0.106,822,18,Mr. APPLEGATE.," Mr. Speaker, the issue  of record high levels of imports arriving on  our shores daily,  leading  to  record high  deficits  and  excessive  unemployment of  manufacturing jobs, has become a national  concern. With an obvious lack of concern  by the administration and, up until now, a  failure on  the part of Congress  to act,  much has been left to the American citi zens who are making themselves aware of  the problem and are taking it upon them sevles to make others, including this Con gress, aware of the need to ""Buy Ameri can"" and to take swift and positive correc tive action.  A perfect example of the type of commu nity concern for this problem is being dem onstrated right now in Steubenville, OH, in  my  congressional  district. A  downtown  rally  commemorating  ""Buy  American  Awareness Day"" is going on at this very  minute. A special thank you for generating  the type of support to buy American-made  products being expressed right now goes to  the Steubenville business community,  the  Steubenville Area Board of Realtors, and,  particularly, to Mrs. Wrenn Bethel and her  committee.  Mr. Speaker, the people of this country  want trade reform, and they want it now.  They are looking to this Congress to pro vide it and we had better listen.

382,Senate,99,-0.351,848,18,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr.  President,  I  strongly support this bill.  In 1980,  the Congress created  the  Superfund,  recognizing  the need  to  clean up  the many hazardous waste  sites which endanger the health of all  Americans.  Unfortunately,  progress  has been far too slow. Only six priori ty sites have been cleaned up across  the whole country in the last 5 years.  The Environmental Protection Agency  has begun to address only 20 percent  of the 850 sites on the national priori ty list. And, the General Accounting  Office has  estimated  that we may  have as many as 4,000 national priori ty sites.  Iowa has seven toxic waste sites on  the national Superfund  list. Twenty  additional sites are listed under Iowa's  State Superfund law. In addition, it is  estimated  that 270  Iowa dumpsites  contain hazardous or potentially haz ardous materials.  In spite of the size of this problem,  we have seen years of footdragging  and efforts to cut back. Every month  of delay only adds to the cost that will  have to be paid. There is no saving by  delay. Delay  only makes many  of  these sites more dangerous and harder  to  clean up.  It only  increases  the  danger of  contaminating  the water  supply.  This bill calls for spending $7.5 bil lion over 5 years. Estimates for  the  total cost of the cleanup efforts range  from EPA's figure of $23 billion to the  Office  of Technology Assessment's  view that it could take $100 billion to  solve the problem.  We need  to approve a  larger pro gram. I understand that the adminis tration would like to spend less. But  that is the wrong way to go. Studies  have shown that the money can be  well spent. Spending the higher sum  does  not  really  increase  costs.  It  simply has us clean up the sites more  quickly. And, in the long run, it means  that we will spend less.  I am concerned about a key aspect of  the bill-the value added tax charged  to every manufacturer in the country.  I  voted against  the amendment by  Senator ABDNOR which would have ex empted fertilizer and animal feed be cause I believe that if we are going to  have this tax, then we should not be  creating further exemptions. It should  fall on all manufacturing. However, I  want to make it clear that I have res ervations about any value added tax.  I would have preferred to see the Fi nance Committee propose a package  of taxes which looked more to the pol luters.  I do believe that a tax on hazardous  wastes would create a very substantial  incentive for the producers and users  of that waste to find ways to cut down  the amount that needs disposal.  If  With a ""waste end tax,"" we would  see producers of waste adopting all  types of creative mechanisms to recy cle the waste or to avoid its produc tion. And, that would mean fewer ex pensive and dangerous problems in the  future.  I also recognize that there are many  technical and substantive issues which  prevented  the  Finance  Committee  from developing such a proposal  in cluding the desire not to favor one dis posal method over another  through  the tax system.  I  understand  that  the Ways apd  Means Committee plans  to seriously  look at this question along with other  funding mechanisms.  the  other  body passes a  reasonable plan, one  providing for reliable funding, I would  urge that the conferees sympathetical ly  examine  the alternative  funding  mechanism to the value added tax.

383,Senate,99,-0.352,848,18,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of the Superfund reauthoriza tion, H.R. 2005, which we have before  us today. I am proud to vote for a bill  that I believe is a strong and responsi ble answer  to a complex problem.  I  urge my colleagues to join with me in  commending the determined and fruit ful work of the committee in crafting  H.R. 2005.  Hazardous wastes represent a com plex  problem. They  pose  a  direct  threat to our citizens and our environ ment. The improper disposal of these  wastes has had a significant negative  impact on both terrestrial and aquatic  ecosystems. There is little doubt that  without management  of  past  and  present waste, we could be faced with  problems of considerable magnitude.  The extent of our hazardous waste  problem and the consequent cleanup  efforts necessary are now becoming  evident. The number of waste sites on  the national priorities list is increasing  steadily and the Office of Technology  Assessment projects that as many as  10,000 sites may finally be added to  the  list. Cost  estimates of cleanup  have also  increased. GAO and OTA  project that the final cost might total  $40 billion and $100 billion respective ly. And unfortunately, many of those  numbers may have to be adjusted be cause of problems that are just begin ning to reveal themselves. Although I  would have preferred a higher level of  funding for Superfund, I am pleased  that we will be providing almost five  times the level of funding during the  last authorization.  In addition,  I am particularly dis turbed by recent reports on the extent  of ground water contamination since  so many Americans  rely on ground  water as their primary source of drink ing water.  I am hopeful  that EPA,  armed with this strong bill that we are  approving  today, will make  every  effort to deal with the issues that will  undoubtely develop during the life of  this Superfund.  While the problem of how to deal  with our toxic waste dumpsites is sig nificant, I believe that we are proving  that it is not insurmountable. We have  learned much during the first 5 years  of Superfund. This bill enables EPA to  use this experience, advancements in  technology, and increased financial re sources to move toward alleviating this  environmental threat.  Mr. President, I am proud that the  Senate will soon be on record approv ing a strong commitment to the envi ronment and a strong commitment to  the future health and safety of our  Nation. I urge my colleagues to sup port  this worthwhile  legislation by  voting in favor of H.R. 2005.  ",1985
384,Senate,99,-0.371,913,18,Mr. BURDICK.," I rise in opposition  to a 2-percent across-the-board cut in  the Treasury /Postal Service  appro priations bill. Let us look, for example,  specifically at the effect  this would  have on the revenue forgone function.  A 2-percent reduction in the revenue  forgone  appropriation will  seriously  hurt the affected mailers. Even with  the $801 million contained in this bill  for revenue forgone, the mailers who  use  this subsidy do not escape  rate  hikes. Library rate mailings will  in crease 24 percent. Classroom materi als,  veterans  and  religious mailings  would be up 30 percent. Small newspa pers would skyrocket 42 to 56 percent.  The 2-percent cut suggested by Sen ator DoMENICI will result in an esti mated $16 million loss in the revenue  forgone category. Just how much do  we want  to hurt  these mailers  this  year in the name of budget balancing?  Through lower postal rates, the Fed eral Government  acknowledges  the  important contributions made to socie ty by the nonprofit mailing communi ty and assists nonprofits to channel as  much  revenue as possible  into pro gram services rather than operational  expenses. The administration has re peatedly stated their commitment to  this idea.  Since the administration agrees that  reduced postage  rates  for nonprofit  mailers  is a  good  idea,  the way  to  ensure their continuation is through  direct and sufficient appropriations.  Even $801 million is not as much as I  would like to see for the worthy cause;  $16 million less, as proposed by Sena tor DoMENICI  is totally unacceptable;  $801 million  for  revenue  forgone  is  $166 million below the 1985 funding  figure.  It is $160 million below  the  $961 million contained in the House passed Treasury /Postal Service appro priations bill. And  it does not place  this Treasury /Postal Service  appro priations bill over  its budget alloca tion.  For all these reasons, I support the  bill, and oppose  the present amend ment.  ",1985
385,Senate,99,-0.192,952,18,Mr. JOHNSTON.," Mr.  President,  today I am pleased to introduce legis lation to return the ad valorem and  specific duties on necktie imports to  the levels in effect as of January 1,  1981, for a period of 5 years.  Unfortunately, imports of men's and  boys' neckties have accelerated sharp ly in the last 4 years. Since 1980, im ports have grown from  insignificant  levels to 20 percent of the U.S. market.  In 1984 alone, neckwear  imports  in creased by a whopping 64 percent,  double the very high growth in overall  textile and apparel imports over the  same period.  The problem with silk necktie  im ports is particularly grave. In the first  half of 1985, imports of silk neckties  680,  1985  rose by 34  percent over  the  same  period in 1984. Silk is the largest cate gory of imports, and accounted for 52  percent of total U.S. imports of neck ties  in  the  January  to  June  period.  The situation with silk necktie im ports is exacerbated by the fact that  silk and products of silk are not cov ered by  the multifiber arrangement  and,  thus, the industry is unable  to  seek  relief  under  this mechanism,  which purpose  is  to control interna tional  trade  in  textiles and apparel.  Moreover, while S.  the  textile  quota bill, does  include silk and silk  products as textile products for pur poses of quota, the bill excludes Italy  from quota coverage. And Italy is the  source for most U.S.  imports of silk  neckties-some 87 percent in the first  half of 1985. This is precisely why the  necktie industry needs the legislative  relief called for by my bill.  Necktie  imports  are  growing  by  record numbers at a time when duties  on  these  imports are being phased  down as a result of the Tokyo Round  tariff cuts. These cuts range from 20  percent in some categories to over half  the former duty rate in others. While  the average  tariff rate  last year on  clothing imports was in excess of 21  percent, the average duty on necktie  imports was 12 percent. Virtually no  category of neckties has escaped the  pressures of  increased  imports. And  the industry sees the situation worsen ing as the multilateral trade negotia tion [MTN1 phased duty rate reduc tions  continue  to  be  implemented  through 1987.  If necktie imports continue to accel erate at the current rate-stimulated  by declining duty  rates-this  indus try's continued viability will be very  much in question as will be the jobs of  its workers.  This  is  an  industry  composed of  many small establishments, generally  employing fewer than 20 workers. The  work is highly labor intensive and skill  levels are not transferable to jobs out side  of  the  cut-and-sew  industries  where unemployment is already stag gering. This industry has provided a  source of employment for many mi norities;  it has provided entry  level  employment when no other employ ment was to be found.  Because the import situation in this  industry  is  so grave, and conditions  have worsened so rapidly,  legislation  for a temporary adjustment to the ad  valorem and specific duties on necktie  imports is needed. A temporary adjust ment  is well warranted. Without  it,  the consequences for the industry and  its workers will be severe. It is now  time for the Congress to act on this  matter. Consequently, I urge my col leagues to expenditiously approve this  legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of this bill be print ed in the RECORD.

387,,99,-0.315,991,18,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to share an article from the Ravalli  Republic, a newspaper in the district I rep resent, on September 16, 1985. This article  relates the findings of a study released by  the U.S. Forest Service on the civilian con servation corps centers of the Job Corps as  they relate to the centers in my district.  FOREST SERVICE: JOB CORPS WORK OFFSETS  COSTS  The nation's Job Corps Centers have been  assailed Reagan budget makers  in recent  months as a costly program that's not worth  the expense.  But the U.S. Forest Service has come out  with a report that defends two of the cen ters,  including Trapper Creek Job Corps  south of Darby and  the Anaconda  Job  Corps Center near Anaconda.  The agency says that in the past year, the  two Job Corps Centers contributed more  than $2 million worth of work in the Na tional Forests and other public properties.  Mission of the centers is to educate and  train young men  and women. And  the  Forest Service says Job Corps enrollees at  the center  last year put  in 2,265 work  months in accomplishing $2,083,600 of work  on public lands and facilities in the National  Forests.  Work included maintenance and upgrad ing the Center's facilities. Men and women  enrollees did welding, carpentry, concrete  work,  bricklaying,  operated heavy equip ment, and did maintenance work.  The Forest Service says  the Job Corps  centers contributed work only on projects  with inadequate funds for completion. Con tributed  Job Corps work,  under  federal  rules, cannot displace workers or contrac tors and the project, says the Forest Serv ice, must provide ""meaningful training and  work experience.""  A  total of 233 men and women are en rolled at Trapper Creek while 229 men and  women are enrolled at the Anaconda Job  Corps Center.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  GETTING TOUGH ON NERVE  GAS  HON. DANTE B. FASCELL  OF FLORIDA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  Mr. F ASCELL. Mr. Speaker, the editorial  entitled ""How To Get Tough With Nerve  Gas"" in yesterday's New York Times cap tures the sound foreign policy, arms con trol, defense, and budgetary reasons why a  bipartisan majority  in the House has op posed  the production of binary nerve gas  chemical munitions.  In addition, persistent test failures and  technical deficiencies continue  to plague  the binary Bigeye bomb. This fact was reaf firmed just last week in  the General Ac counting Office  report  to Congress  in  which GAO again recommended that Con gress should not fund  the binary produc tion program in fiscal year 1986. This GAO  report concludes  that the binary funding  request is premature because ""the Bigeye  bomb has not met the established minimum  chemical requirement for chemical purity  and numerous critical technical issues are  unresolved.""  This is sound counsel and advice which I  hope will be affirmed as we appropriate de fense levels in fiscal year 1986.  The New York Times editorial follows:  [From the New York Times, Sept. 25, 19851  How TO GET TouGH WITH NERVE GAs  Nerve gas is a hideous weapon, but as long  as Soviet troops are equipped with chemical  munitions,  American  troops  cannot  denied an effective response. That's why the  Defense Department's plan to build a new  generation  of  chemical  arms-so-called  ""binary"" weapons-is so dismaying. Never  mind their vast extra cost, their stabilizing  effect on NATO or the initiation of a new  race in chemical arms; the new binary weap ons will be less effective.  Every new weapon has defects, often seri ous, which field tests may remedy. Binary  weapons surely have their share, but these  as-yet-unknown flaws remain undetected be cause Congress has restricted field tests. No  soldier should be asked to fight with untest ed weapons. And the Bigeye bomb, one of  the  proposed  binary weapons,  is  still  plagued with manifest design flaws.  Advocates  say binary weapons will be  safer to handle, since the nerve gas is not  generated until two chemicals are mixed, in  flight, in the delivery shell. Maybe, but the  present shells and bombs have a long and  excellent safety record, without a single se rious accident. Why fix a non-problem? Ad  vacates of binaries contend  the present  stockpile has sprung leaks. Yes,  there are  minute leaks-in 0.0006 percent of artillery  shells. All other stockpiled shells are usable.  The only practical reason for moving to  binary weapons would be evidence that the  present  stockpile might  later deteriomte  beyond use. That's an answerable technical  question. A blue-ribbon panel appointed by  the Department of Defense  is conducting  aging  tests. Why  rush  to  start making  binary weapons, costing $2.3 billion over five  years, when these tests may well show the  present stockpile has a long life ahead?  What truly needs fixing is not chemical  offense but defense. The Pentagon has so  be  25215  far failed to institute advice by the Defense  Science Board to remedy gaps in manpower,  training and equipment. The Army has no  medical products  in the field  for care of  chemical casualties, no proper decontamin ants of equipment and no antidote against  the standard Soviet nerve gas. Commanders  ofter subvert training requirements, such as  showing troops how to eat in a contaminat ed environment, according to the General  Accounting Office.  Maintaining deficient chemical defenses,  and  replacing  effective  weapons  with  unproven ones, is hardly the best way of de terring the Soviet Union from first use of  chemical weapons.  For the last three years the House has re fused to allow production of binary weap ons. This year, under the shadow of the hi jacked Americans  taken hostage  in Leba non, it mistakenly changed position, but re quired  that production  not begin  until  NATO  requests  that binary weapons be  stored in Europe. Since several NATO coun tries are highly unlikely to allow present  stockpiles to be replaced with binaries, the  condition is highly desirable insurance. Yet  it was surrendered in conference with the  Senate.  The House has a chance  to  redress  its  error next month as it writes the Pentagon's  appropriations bill. Binary weapons are a  bad buy, and there's no good reason for the  House to abandon its longstanding distrust  of them.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM R.  CLARK  HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 26, 1985  ",1985
388,,99,0.141,1017,18,Mr. LEACH of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, the  admission this week by the French Govern ment of direct responsibility for the attack  on the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow War rior, has raised profound moral questions  as well underscored important lessons for  all democratic systems of governance.  For 14 years, Greenpeace has striven to  prevent nuclear  testing and save endan gered sea animals. It is a profound irony  that an organization dedicated  to peace  and nonviolence should fall victim to such  a  senseless act of state-sponsored  terror ism.  From an American perspective, it is in structive to search out the important les sons of this  tragedy. There appear to be  several of note.  First, a great power can make a great  mistake,  this one bordering on  the silly.  For France to seek recourse  in sabotage  against an idealistic few could not demon strate more  graphically  the  increasing  tendency of peoples-and governments-to  vent  their disagreements and accomplish  their objectives  through violence against  innocents.  Second, even if seemingly justified from  a national  interest perspective, acts  that  violate international law and international  norms of behavior are generally counter productive. Support for Greenpeace as well  as senseless rifts between democratic coun tries like New Zealand and France can only  grow after such egregious, premeditated vi olence.  Third, seldom can a democratic society  engage in covert violence without eventual ly being forced to accept responsibility. In telligence services must understand that de spite great safeguards,  leaks often occur  and, as in this instance, a government in  power has been forced to recant, to its em barrassment and jeopardy.  Fourth,  few  governments have  armies  that can stand up to the awesome military  capabilities of the nuclear powers. But in  the area of terrorism, they can compete on  equal, and in some cases stronger, footing  because acts of a terrorist nature are usual ly less acceptable in democratic as opposed  to  authoritarian  societies.  Accordingly,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  democratic governments have a vested in terest in avoiding terrorism and conform ing foreign policy as pristinely as possible  to international law. Adherence to the rule  of law should be the touchstone that distin guishes democracy from politically repres sive systems of the left and the right. Au thoritarian societies should never be given  the excuse of rationalizing terror~sm as a  tit-for-tat response to the illegal acts of de mocracies.  Europeans  sometimes assume  that  the  venerable histories of their societies pro vide them a greater grasp of the subtleties  of international affairs and diplomacy. The  Greenpeace  episode belies  such  assump tions.  But  in  the case, we would do well  to  assess the mistakes of the French and ask  whether there are lessons for our own for eign policy. Does it, for instance, advance  international law to deny the jurisdiction  of the World Court over our poliGtes  in  Central America? Do we  retard or tnvite  greater  terrorism by aiding and abetting  counterrevolutionary forces  in Nicaragua?  Can we insulate our interventionist policy  in Lebanon from reactions against Ameri cans and governmental facilities, here and  abroad?  In plotting the sinking of the Rainbow  Warrior, the French appear to have overre acted to the Greenpeace movement. In ini tially denying public accountability  they  appear to have underestimated the demand  for truth in a democracy.  An American might ask whether Paris  has become anesthetized to the subtleties of  right and wrong in national security policy.  A Frenchman might respond that the anes thesia had been administered  in powerful  doses on this side of the Atlantic.  THE YEAR OF THANKSGIVING  HON. TONY P.

Previously, we  had  introduced House  Joint Resolution 398, a resolution to desig nate 1986 as the ""Year of Thanksgiving.""  The National Committee of the Year of  Thanksgiving has advised us of their deci sion to focus upon 1987 as  the ""Year of  Thanksgiving."" The year 1987 will be espe cially appropriate since it marks both the  bicentennial of  the Constitution of  the  United States and  the convening of  the  1 OOth Congress. In addition,  the selection  of the year 1987 will provide extra time for  the preparation of ceremonies and activi ties to observe the ""Year of Thanksgiving.""  Therefore, we are introducing a new res olution to reflect this change. The resolu tion we  are  introducing  is  identical  to  House Joint Resolution 398, except that the  ""Year of Thanksgiving"" has been changed  from 1986 to 1987.  25241  We urge our colleagues to join with us as  cosponsors of the ""Year of Thanksgiving""  resolution. The text of the resolution fol lows:  H.J. REs. 398  To designate 1987 as the ""Year of  Thanksgiving"".  Whereas, since the days of the early set tlers, it has been a tradition of the Ameri can people to celebrate a season of thanks giving;  Whereas many of our great national lead ers,  including President Washington and  President Lincoln,  recognized  the  impor tance of setting aside a time of thanksgiving  by Presidential proclamation, as in procla mations  which  established  the  fourth  Thursday  in November  as Thanksgiving  Day;  Whereas, in 1941, Thanksgiving Day was  established as a permanent national holi day; and  Whereas, in 1987, the people of the United  States will celebrate the Bicentennial of the  Constitution of the United States and the  convening of  the  lOOth Congress: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That 1987 is desig nated as the ""Year of Thanksgiving"", and  the President is authorized and requested to  issue a proclamation calling upon the Gov ernors of the several States, the chief offi cials of local governments, and the people of  the United States to observe such year with  appropriate ceremonies and activities.

390,,99,-0.401,1017,18,Mr. LOWRY of Washington.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to take this opportunity to  extend my best wishes  to Lev Elbert of  Ki'ev on the occasion of his 37th birthday  on September 30. Lev, his wife Inna, and  their  son Carmi  are  among  the many  Soviet Jews who  inspire us all with  the  courage, dignity, and determination  that  characterize their struggle to win the rights  to worship freely and to emigrate.  The past few years have been difficult  ones for the Elberts. In 1983, Lev was sen tenced to imprisonment in a labor camp for  refusing to report for reserve military duty.  His refusal stemmed from his concern that  the authorities would claim that he was ex posed to military secrets during the addi tional military service and use this excuse  to permanently deny him permission  to  emigrate. Inna's health has suffered from a  hunger strike  that she began  to protest  phony drug charges against Lev, which  were eventually dropped. Their son Carmi  was injured in anti-Semitic attacks at his  school.  In May of this year, Lev's most  recent application for permission  to emi grate was turned down. Lev's brother has  received  anti-Semitic hate mail. But  the  family has shown immense inner strengths  throughout their ordeal.  I know that our continuing expressions  of support and concern are a great help. I  ",1985

392,,99,0.203,1030,18,Mr. GALLO.," Mr. Speaker, recently, I in troduced  a  bill, H.R.  3371,  designed  to  reduce the defaults in the Guaranteed Stu dent Loan  Program  and  the National  Direct Student Loan Program.  Each year, Congress provides an increas ing amount of money to guarantee loans  made to students by banks and other au thorized lenders. In addition to subsidizing  the interest rates on these loans, the Feder al Government also pays lenders in cases of  student defaults. The  two  largest student  aid programs are the Guaranteed Student  Loan Program and the National Direct Stu dent Loan Program which required Federal  obligations of $3.1 billion and $217 million  in fiscal year 1984, respectively.  The most recent figures show  that de faults on these student loans have reached  an alarming total of $1.1 billion, a figure  that has doubled  in the last 4 years. The  Secretary of Education has further indicat ed that total defaults could go as high as $3  billion in the near future, with the national  default rate reaching 10.7 percent last year  and projected  to go  to 11.7 percent  this  year.  This situation has developed because of  the common misconception  that no one  loses if a student defaults. In fact, you and  I,  the taxpayers, lose. In addition, the in creasing number of students who rely on  these loans to finance their education are  penalized since more of the Federal contri bution to financial aid is required to cover  loan defaults.  To  remedy  this  situation,  the Federal  Government, as well as State governments,  has taken action to increase collections on  student  loans,  including  garnishing  the  wages of Government employees who have  outstanding  loans  and withholding  tax  refund checks.  Further actions, however, are necessary  to prevent loans from going into default in  ",1985

395,,99,-0.104,1108,18,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues the  lOOth  anniversary  celebration  of Saint  Mary, Refuge of Sinners Catholic Church  in Cambridge, MD.  As we  in Maryland commemorate Saint  Mary, Refuge of Sinners Church's untiring  and  unwavering  commitment  to  faith  during the past century, I believe it is alto gether fitting that we give  thanks to the  many church members who, over the gen erations, have brought comfort and light to  the people of Cambridge. On momentous  occasions such as this, we not only share  remembrances of a rich and vibrant past,  <The upcoming Superfund vote will be the  most important pollution decision this Con gress makes. Will  the  law serve polluters  better than the public?>  The American people are deeply troubled  by the dangers of toxic wastes. According to  a recent poll, 93 percent of the population is  seriously concerned. The highly hazardous  effluvia of our nation's industries, dumped  indiscriminately  across  landscapes urban,  suburban, and rural, pose a deadly threat to  individuals, and they know it.  But in the crowded chamber of the House  Energy and Commerce Committee on June  20, there was no evidence of the widespread  public demand to clean up toxic dumps. In stead it was business as all-too-usual, as the  Subcommittee on Commerce, Transporta tion and Tourism voted on  legislation  to  extend the five-year-old federal Superfund  September 30, 1985  program. Encouraged by chemical and oil  industry lobbyists, the subcommittee struck  down a strong Superfund bill by a vote of 13  to 5. After repudiating its own chair's draft  bill, the subcommittee substituted a diluted  measure crafted by Reps. John Dingell <D Mich.> and James Broyhill <R-N.C.>. respec tively the chair and ranking Republican on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Environmentalists were  appalled.  The  Dingell-Broyhill  bill,  said  subcommittee  chair James Florio <D-N.J.), would perpet uate the agonizingly slow pace of cleanup  the nation has endured for  the  last five  years.  ""Power politics, pure and simple,""  was Sierra Club lobbyist Blake Early's as sessment. ""Polluters couldn't have written a  better bill for themselves.""  In fact, the vote marked a stunning rever sal. Just ten months earlier, in August of a  presidential election year, the full House of  Representatives  had  adopted  a  much  stronger Superfund bill by a lopsided 323-to33 margin. Now the subcommittee had re jected a bill modeled on that earlier version  and substituted a much weaker bill in its  place.  Members of the subcommittee who voted  for the Dingell-Broyhill bill had various ex planations and excuses for adopting a bill so  compatible with the desires of the chemical  industry. Several suggested they had voted  for it because nothing stronger could possi bly pass this timorous subcommittee-a pre diction made certain by  their defections.  Several talked hopefully about strengthen ing the bill later, when the full committee  took up the issue, a prospect Rep. Gerry Si korski <D-Minn.> likened to ""putting wings  on a sow.""  Through July the full Energy and Com merce Committee labored over the Dingell Broyhill bill, but the results were consist ently the same. Amendments to strengthen  the bill were defeated day after day. Ulti mately the committee approved the bill in  about the same form they had received it all sow and no wings. As a result, the entire  House will be faced in September with the  most important pollution and public health  vote of the year:  It will either ratify or  reject the Dingell-Broyhill Superfund.  The nation's toxic waste cleanup program  was in trouble even before this legislative  setback. Created five years ago to finance  emergency cleanup of abandoned hazardous  waste dumps, the program has only begun  to tackle the effort. Hundreds of sites iden tified  by  the Environmental  Protection  Agency have yet to be studied,  let alone  cleaned up. Hundreds more are being added  to the backlog each year. There are now  more sites classified as extr<!mely dangerous  than when the law was first enacted in Sep tember 1980.  Cleaning up toxic waste dumps is extreme ly difficult. Many of the sites contain dozens  of  chemically  diverse,  highly  toxic  sub stances  in a morass of abandoned mine  shafts,  underground  springs, or  swamps.  Cleanup  is also expensive. But  the EPA  needs motivation and support as much as it  needs money and know-how. The agency's  current administrator, Lee Thomas,  lacks  the political base to serve as advocate for an  effective program.  Congress has the opportunity to rectify  these problems. It can mandate that the  EPA proceed on an aggressive schedule to  study  the most dangerous  sites and get  them  cleaned up  promptly,  and  ensure  enough funding to do so. It can empower  citizens whose health is theatened by aban doned dumps to sue  those responsible. It  ",1985
396,Senate,99,0.391,1121,18,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, it  is a pleasure for me to pay tribute to  the  black  airmen  who  heroically  served our Nation  in  the European  theater in World War II. For the bene fit of my distinguished colleagues and  our country, I would like to mention  some of their achievements.  51-059 0-86-36 (Pt. 18)  THE 99TH PURSUIT SQUADRON  Mr. President, records show that the  pilots  in  the all-black 99th Pursuit  Squadron proved themselves in a posi tive way in the European theater in  World War II. These brave pilots of  the 99th Squadron were  trained at  Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.  The first combat assignment of the  99th Squadron came on June 2, 1943.  The operation called for the squadron  to be wingmen on a strafing mission  against the heavily fortified island of  Pantelleria, near Italy. Following sev eral days of strafing and bombing, the  enemy  forces  of  the  island  surren dered on June 11, 1943.  On July 2, 1943, six 99th Pursuit  Squadron pilots were assigned the role  of escorting 16 B-25 bombers, whose  mission was to bomb the Castelvetrano  Airfield on the island of Sicily. Just  after  the bombs were dropped,  two  enemy aircraft attempted  to attack  the bombers, but the 99th pilots inter cepted them. One of the enemy air craft was shot down, and  the other  turned and faded  into  the distance.  Not a single bomber was lost on this  mission.  Mr. President, until the end of the  war in Europe in May 1945, the 99th  Pursuit Squadron protected bombers  on flights all over the Continent of  Europe,  specifically  including  the  countries of Greece, Hungary, Roma nia, Austria, Poland, Italy, and Germa ny. Part of  the Tuskegee  airmen's  pride was the fact that they did not  lose  any  bombers  on  their  escort  flights.  For  the  record, Mr. President,  I  would like to list some of the sacrifices  and heroic achievements in combat of  black airmen in Europe in World War  II:  COMBAT RECORD OF BLACK AIRMEN  ENEMY PROPERTY DESTROYED  111 aircraft <in the air), 150 aircraft <on  the ground), 16 barges and boats, 58 box  cars and other rolling stock, 57 locomotives,  1 radar installation, 2 oil and ammunition  dumps.  ACTION IN FLIGHT  1,578 grand total of missions flown, 15,533  grand total of sorties flown, 992 pilots grad uated at Tuskegee, 450 pilots sent overseas,  66 killed in action.  AWARDS  1 Legion of Merit <military award con ferred by the President), 1 Silver Star <by  the United States for gallantry in action), 2  soldier medals <by U.S.-decoration for brav ery-risk of life), 8 Purple Hearts <by U.S. wounded  in  action),  150  Distinguished  Flying Crosses (by U.S. for heroism or ex ceptional  service  in  aerial  combat>.  14  Bronze Stars <by U.S. for valor, decoration  for courage), 740 air medals and clusters (by  U.S.  for meritorious  achievement while  flying).  A SOUTH CAROLINIAN IN BLACK HISTORY  South Carolina is proud that one of  its natives  taught and  trained  the  pilots of the 99th Squadron at Tuske gee Institute. He is Mr. Ernest Henderson, Sr., a native of Laurens County,  SC. At the age of 25, Mr. Henderson  became a proficient civilian pilot and  flight  instructor  in  the Army Air  Corps. He had the distinct privilege of  being a  flying mate of the late and  famous Gen. Daniel ""Chappie"" James,  Jr .. at Tuskegee Institute, AL,  in the  1940's. They flew  the same airplanes  from  the same airport and had  the  same  flight  instructors  during  the  early years of their careers in aviation.  Flight  Instructors Henderson  and  James both  completed  the Civilian  Pilot Training Program under Chief  Charles A. Anderson at Tuskegee In stitute, and both were employed as  flight  instructors  in  the Army Air  Corps Aviation Cadet Program.  In  1943, when Daniel ""Chappie"" James,  Jr., entered the program as a cadet,  Ernest Henderson was retained at the  flying school at Tuskegee as a flight  instructor,  although  he wanted  to  enter the Cadet Program. He soon at tained the position of assistant squad ron commander, a position in which  he gave flight tests and flight exami nations to cadets seeking graduation.  Mr. Henderson trained on the average  of 20 cadets a year who entered aerial  combat in the aforementioned famous,  all-black,  99th  Pursuit  Squadron  which made history in the European  theater in World War II.  Mr. Henderson was the first black  man from the State of South Carolina  to have a commercial pilot license and  hold ground instructor, flight instruc tor, and  instrument  ratings.  In  the  years following the war, Ernest Hen derson became a great leader and edu cator in my State. South Carolinians  are extremely proud of Ernest Hender son, who has been an active  leader  throughout his life in church, educa tion, community, State, and national  affairs, especially in national defense  matters.  An article, by Sue Ellis in the State  Newspaper in Columbia, SC, entitled,  ""From Plow to Plane-Retired Educa tor Broke Ground  in Aviation,"" elo quently  presents  the  life  story  of  Ernest Henderson's climb  from  the  bottom to the top of the ladder of suc cess.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this fine newspaper article  about Mr. Ernest Henderson be pub lished in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  ""FROM PLow TO PLANE,"" NEIGHBORS SECTION,  THE STATE NEWSPAPER, COLUMBIA, SC  <By Sue Willis)  Ernest Henderson's childhood fascination  with soaring in the skies not only unexpect edly materialized  into a  career. but also  came to cast him in a vital role in breaking  the codes of prejudice that gripped World  War II America.

399,House,99,-0.14,1264,18,Mr. THOMAS of Georgia.," I  my colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to  join with the many friends of Walter  Harrison in this tribute. This is a very  special time for me because Mr. Harri son was a resident of Millen, GA,  in  my congressional district, and he was a  wonderful friend and a  trusted coun selor to me for a number of years.  The death of Colonel Harrison, as  many of us called him, was an event  that means many things to me person ally.  On one hand, it marked the loss of a  light of  leadership  that we had all  come to depend on for decades. It was  a sad and tragic loss for our State and  our Nation.  But from another perspective, his  passing has led me and many others to  reflect on, and celebrate, the joy that  comes from the life of a man who gave  much more than he took. That is the  heart and soul of Walter Harrison-a  man who dedicated himself to public  service in the highest and finest sense  of the word.  I often dropped by to visit Mr. Harri son in his office at the Millen News,  the paper that he loved and edited for  years. His desk was always cluttered  with  the materials  of  his  latest  projects and  latest battles, and his  walls were covered with  the awards  and tributes of past accomplishments.  In the space of a few moments, Mr.  Harrison would make you at home  with his booming and resonant voice  of welcome, have you in a chair, and  launch into questions and statements  about issues ranging from outer space  to historic  renovation. He had  that  special spark of enthusiasm that even  at age 85 allowed him to take a listen er and transform that person into a  partner-a partner in his latest project  for the public good.  I  left  the House  floor  just a  few  months ago to go downtown here in  Washington to celebrate with Colonel  Harrison when he was  inducted into  the Cooperative League of the USA  Hall of Fame  in  recognition of his  work in behalf of rural electrification.  I drove to his home in Millen this past  May to visit with him during his ill ness, and he was a man facing that ill ness with characteristic courage. He  turned aside questions about his phys ical condition and instead was full of  questions and comments of his own  about the many issues in which he was  still involved.  The work of Colonel Harrison  in  regard to electric power is legendary,  and the public record of his life will  show that he was the pioneer who had  the  insight  and  skill  to make  the  dream of universal electric service a  reality in my State.  It is hard to imagine a Georgia or an  America today that was ever without  electricity, and yet that was ju~t the  situation for most of the land area of  my State at about  the  time of my  birth. It took men like Walter Harri son to recognize that affordable elec tric power was the foundation of any  effort to pull rural America from eco nomic stagnation, and it took men like  Walter Harrison to turn what was a  dream into a reality.  I will not dwell on Mr. Harrison's ac complishments regarding rural electri fication because  that  is well  estab lished  in  the public  record. But we  should take special note that he had  the vision to select the great issue of  his day as the goal of his professional  life, and we should remember that he  developed a remarkable array of skills  to accomplish his goal.  I say that because Colonel Harrison  was a man who combined the tough ness of a drill sergeant with the speak ing skills of a great preacher, and a  heart as big as the Nation he loved. He  was a soft touch for anyone in need,  and he responded to every appeal for  assistance with a worthy cause.  For any normal man, Colonel Harri son's work with rural electrification  would have left no time for other af fairs, but that was not his nature. He  was a tireless servant to the public and  was elected to just about every office  he ever cared to hold, from council man and mayor to State senator. He  was a renaissance man of rural Amer ica.  Mr.  Speaker, with  the  death  of  Walter Harrison, our Nation has lost a  dynamic  leader, and  I  have  lost  a  treasured friend.  Our  tributes  to him are from our  hearts, but no matter what words of  honor we may speak, none can do him  greater tribute than the monuments  of accomplishment that he fashioned  with his own deeds. We take comfort  in the fact that his accomplishments  will stand strong and tall long after we  in this Chamber are gone.  It was a privilege for me  to know  Walter Harrison. It was an honor to  count him as a friend. He brought the  light of electric power to generations  of Americans, but more importantly,  he taught us that the light within our selves is more powerful than any ob stacle to a worthwhile goal.  May God bless that great man and  may God  comfort  his  family  and  hometown friends.  I would like to conclude my remarks  by inserting into the RECORD the com ments of a man who knew and loved  Walter Harrison  for many, many  years. He is Mr. Frank Edenfield, the  publisher of the Millen News a man  with great insight into his beloved city  of Millen and rural Georgia. The fol lowing editorial, which was published  in the Millen newspaper on August 15  of this year, is the finest testament I  have seen to one of the finest men I  have ever known:  ",1985
400,,99,-0.184,1277,18,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues a  valedictorian address recently delivered by  a Florida high school student.  Her name  is Kimberly Anne Ackourey,  valedictorian of the 1985 graduating class  of Pope John Paul II High School in Boca  Raton.  Ms. Ackourey's address is a stirring trib ute to the indomitable nature of the human  spirit. It is a call to action, a plea for com passion in our troubled age. It speaks to  what is good and giving in each of us. The  youthful author of these words has wisdom  beyond her years, Mr. Speaker, and I com mend her thoughts to my colleagues.  After four years of high school we have  learned about past and present peoples and  cultures. We have formed relationships with  others and have  received an encouraging  sense of accomplishment from both our par ents and our  teachers. We have become  well-rounded individuals who are capable of  making great contributions  to  the world.  The values we have formed at Pope John  Paul II High School will guide us in actions  we will take.  Moral values are more  than persuasive  words that are instilled in the family and in  the classroom. They are demonstrative ex pressions of our love and concern for others.  These values have been enhanced by our  communications with fellow students, facul ty, and staff. They are evident in school  projects, such as in the collection of food  for the poor and in visiting the aged. We  search for a meaningful life filled with in terest because we dread monotony and bore dom. By knowing our fundamental beliefs,  we will be able to live this full and varied  life that each of us strives for.  Advancement characterizes our age. The  whole world will be living with the increas ing  implications of nuclear weapons and  energy, space travel, computer technology  and medical innovations. However, science  and industry cannot decide our future. We,  acting as educated individuals, are the only  ones who can make this decision. We of the  graduating class have developed realistic at titudes about our future by becoming more  informed. We have learned to avoid George  Orwell's dismal concept of 1984, and have  adopted Sir Charles Snow's belief of the im portance of combining humanism with tech nology. By understanding  ourselves  and  where we are going, we will not allow such  technology to change the goals in our lives.  Our morals allow us to view  technology  from a more altruistic perspective. Continu ous development is not only imperative, but  it is also inevitable. Advancement must be  applied, therefore, for the benefit and not  the destruction of mankind. Our attitudes  will influence the attitudes of those in the  future, and we must realize our power to  change  situations  in  the world-such as  world hunger and the threat of nuclear hol ocaust. As Albert Einstein once wrote: ""We  have the means to get almost anywhere.""  We graduates have the potential to become  the people we wish to become. We can con tribute  to  society now and  far  into  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  future by believing in ourselves and by uti lizing our skills for the betterment of all.  Justice William 0. Douglas, a great Ameri can who took the path that many of us will  take, emphasized the importance of respon sibility and contribution to society when he  said: ""I hope that America's only dream of  empire will be the common good of human ity. I hope America will come to realize that  her strength is not in fire power but in ideas  of justice, tolerance, equality. We have a de cisive role to play.""  We,  the 1985 graduating class of Pope  John Paul II High School, must now decide  what this role will be. We have many oppor tunities before us, many paths to follow. I  wish each and everyone of you, my fellow  students, the greatest happiness in whichev er route you choose to take. May you always  realize your vast potential and have  the  courage needed to reach all of your goals.  LEA COUNTY-CHAMPION COW BOY CAPITOL OF THE WORLD  HON.

At the end of the war, Dr. Goodson re sumed his education, then moved to Cali fornia in 1952 to establish a medical prac tice  specializing  in  eye,  ear,  nose,  and  throat. Two years later he became one of  the founding members of the board of di rectors of the HEAR Center, a nonprofit  organization that has freed countless chil dren from the world of silence. The center  provides  training  to  both  children  and  adults with hearing and/or speech prob lems and enables them to take an active  role in their community despite deafness or  hearing difficulties.  It has  taken people with  special skill,  dedication, and  responsibility  to provide  the needed services and achieve the goals  of the HEAR Center. Dr. Goodson is such a  25527  person and he has significantly touched the  lives of thousands of individuals who are  deaf or hard of hearing. I am honored to  add my congratulations  to  the many Dr.  Goodson is receiving on this auspicious oc casion.  THE RETIREMENT OF COL. DALE  L. BRAKEBILL  HON. JIM CHAPMAN  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 1, 1985  ",1985
402,,99,-0.198,1303,18,Mr. CHAPMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  in all of  the debate regarding America's defense re quirements, little mention is made of one  of the most important factors in America's  defense readiness, the moral of our fighting  men. There is little more important to the  defense of our Nation than those human  factors  which  determine  whether  our  Armed Forces can meet the challenges pre sented them.  Over the last 30 years, U.S. Air Force has  enjoyed the faithful service of one of my  constituents, Col. Dale L. Brakebill. Colo nel Brakebill began his Air Force career  with the Reserve Officers Training Corps at  Texas Christian University  in 1955. Since  that time, his personnel responsibilities in  the Air Force have spanned the globe, from  special  services  officer  for  the 5th Air  Force at Nagoya and Fuchu, Japan, to ex ecutive officer to the deputy chief of staff  for personnel at Headquarters U.S. Air  Force, Pentagon. He has served as base  commander at Travis Air Force Base, CA,  in numerous capabilities at the Air Force  Manpower and Personnel Center at Ran dolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, to  his  final assignment as assistant deputy  chief of staff for personnel, Headquarters  Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Pat terson Air Force Base, OH. Make no mis take, Mr. Speaker, that personnel manage ment in the Air Force is a most difficult as signment.  During  his  tenure,  Colonel  Brakebill has devoted hard work, commit ment, and expertise to the Air Force, be coming one of its valued experts  in  the  area of personnel management. His devo tion  to  service bas won him numerous  awards  and  decorations,  including  the  Legion of Merit,  the Meritorious Service  Medal,  the Joint Service Commendation  Medal, and  the Air Force Commendation  Medal.  It is indeed my pleasure to join Colonel  Brakebill's many friends and colleagues in  saluting him for his dedicated service  to  our Nation's defense. His dedication  to  duty, and willingness to go the extra mile  to assure that the U.S. defense is second to  none will be sorely missed. I join with the  people of Mount Vernon, TX, all of Frank lin County, and his fellow citizens from the  First District of Texas, in saying, ""Thank  you, Colonel Brakebill,  for  a  job well  done.""

403,House,99,-0.082,11,22,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker,  in  1930 the poverty level in America was  50 percent; in 1980 it was 11 percent;  with Gramm-Latta in 1985, it is 15 per cent. What will  it be  in 1991 with  Gramm-Rudman?  I am not particularly crazy about  either of the deficit reduction plans  that will be brought today before the  House, but I will say this: Many people  are worried, if they would vote against  these measures they would be called  special interest Congressmen.  Well, I have to say that I will not  apologize  for supporting senior citi zens, poor children, food stamps and  nutrition  programs  for  our  poor  people, and I do not think we should  apologize for it.  I  think Members of this House do  not really understand either of those  reduction plans; they were hastily put  together, and we have a shotgun wed ding here today to try and resolve a  A MAJOR CRIME WITHOUT A  CRIMINAL  <Mr. HUGHES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)

406,House,99,-0.306,50,22,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the Rostenkowski amend ment.  I believe that the vote we will soon take  on the Gramm-Rudman proposal will be a  watershed event in the history of this insti tution and Nation.  We are about to fundamentally alter the  way in which spending decisions are made  in the Federal Government, and in so doing  we embark on a cruise into uncharted and  dangerous  waters.  Gramm-Rudman,  in  some form, is coming, and the relationship  between  the  executive  and  legislative  branches will never be the same.  I served on the conference committee on  Gramm-Rudman. I wish every Member of  this House could have had that experience,  I think that is the only way to begin to un derstand the radical departure we are being  asked to make. In the roughly 2112 weeks  the  conference  lasted,  we  subjected  Gramm-Rudman to its first hearings-a re versal of the normal legislative process that  tells you a lot about the form in which this  proposal was  received.  Those  sessions  clearly demonstrated that precise drafting  was not the hallmark of Gramm-Rudman.  Quite simply, no one knew how it was sup posed to work. The hours that House con ferees  subsequently  spent  in  task  forces  trying  to make  sense  out  of Gramm Rudman revealed that the questions raised  by a close examination of this proposal   were of mind-numbing complexity. These  questions, some constitutional, some proce dural, and some mechanical, are not mat ters to be resolved in 3 weeks. But that was  our mandate, because of the absolute ne cessity that the debt ceiling be raised, and  the unwillingness of Gramm-Rudman's pro ponents to consider doing it in any other  way.  Your conferees were  instructed by  this  body to bring back to the House a system  by which deficits would be reduced auto matically. Many of us have serious reserva tions about the wisdom of substituting an  automatic pilot for independent judgment  on spending priorities and decisions, and  yet that substitution is  the foundation of  Gramm-Rudman. The Democratic proposal  we off er today  takes  the automatic pilot  feature of Gramm-Rudman and modifies it  to do four things:  First, take effect this year, so that the  American people can judge for themselves  whether program decimination is the only  way they want the deficit to be reduced;  Second,  insure  that  the  constitutional  issues raised by Gramm-Rudman's seques tration system can receive expeditious judi cial consideration with the knowledge that  if an element of it were found unconstitu tional, the whole process would be invali dated;  Third, guarantee that the Congressional  Budget Office would be responsible for the  reparation of the economic estimates and  reports used  to measure our compliance  with  the deficit  targets,  thereby retaining  some meaningful role for Congress in the  sequestration triggering process; and  Fourth, exempt  some programs which  serve exclusively  low-income people from  sequestration. The simple fact is, that those  programs have borne the brunt of the defi  cit reduction efforts of the  last 4 years.  They will undoubtedly bear the brunt of  similar  congressionally-initiated  budget  control efforts in the future. To hold them  open  to sequestration on top of that,  ig nores the fact that these programs provide  basic services to people who have no alter natives. I make no apologies about wanting  to exempt  food  stamps and AFDC, SSI,  Child Nutrition and similar programs from  sequestration. I thought they comprised the  safety net our president used to so warmly  embrace, and so movingly promise to main tain. We can not preserve all of the safety  net today. But let it be clearly understood  that whatever is preserved is the result of  the actions of Democrats, and not the advo cates of Gramm-Rudman.  Those four elements, it seems to me are  the minimum  necessary  to  inject  some  degree  of  rationality  into  the Gramm Rudman process.  Mr. Speaker, in my opinion the adoption  of the Gramm-Rudman concept will be an  action  this Congress will come  to deeply  regret. I know we are going to get Gramm Rudman  in some form. Under  those cir cumstances, I am going to vote for the Ros tenkowski alternative. Of the two, it better  protects the interests of this institution and  the interests of the majority of those we  represent. I only hope that the advent of  the  Gramm-Rudman  automatic  pilot  system for making spending decisions will  hasten the day when all of us; Congress,  the President, and  the American people,  will take a more honest view of the causes  of our deficit problems, and what needs to  be done to solve them.

408,Senate,99,0.084,115,22,Mr. CHA.,"FEE. One more minute, Mr.  President.  In 1981 EDA attempted a bulk sale  of some of its loans and was offered  less than 15 cents on the dollar.  Now, funding for EDA was eliminat ed, as I say, in the Senate budget plan  this  year. During  the  debate  an  amendment was  offered  to  restore  funding  for EDA and several other  programs, and that was rejected by a  vote of 52 to 44.  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me  say that there may be somebody who  can get up on this floor and say EDA  has done something splendid  in Co lumbia, SC, or Augusta, ME, or some place else. But the point of the debate,  Mr. President, is would we go ahead  with this program if it did not exist?  Should we continue  funding a pro gram  that has not been authorized  since 1982 and spend $160 million, plus  guarantees of $150 million?  ",1985

411,Senate,99,-0.382,141,22,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  I rise in support of H.R. 2965, the ap propriation bill for the Departments  of Commerce, Justice, and State, the  Judiciary, and related agencies.  This bill  is accompanied by report  language that I offered in the subcom mittee, to halt efforts to close the Na tional Weather  Service  station  in  Newark. In May, the Department of  Commerce published its intention to  close the Newark station. This month  or next, it was going to issue requests  for proposals to provide local weather  observations by private contractors.  But, Mr. President, over 75 percent  of the man-hours at the station are  dedicated to functions other than ob servations. These would have to be rethan $30,000  located,  or  simply  terminated. The  result would be  added  expenses at  other stations, or a dimution in service  to the people of New Jersey.  The airport station plays a key role  in  the area's flood warning system.  That system is critical to the health  and safety of citizens  in flood-prone  northern New Jersey. The station also  provides adaptive local forecasting, tai loring general New York forecsts  to  the particular geography, and climate  of New Jersey.  The station also provides on-the-spot  weather information for air transpor tation. There have been a disturbing  number of air  traffic accidents  this  year-many of them, weather related.  We should not risk the safety of air  travelers, by reducing our ability  to  monitor  the latest breaking weather  developments affecting air transporta tion.  Mr. President, the Department has  presented no evidence  that the con tracting out of  this  station would  result in the most efficient means of  providing essential weather service. I  am not opposed  to contracting out,  where  the private sector can accom plish the same goals more efficiently.  But, what we have here is not a case  of Government for less cost. At best,  we have a case of less Government for  less. And how much less? One unoffi cial estimate put the potential savings  at  less  a  year. That's  $30,000 a year to put the flood-prone  areas of New Jersey at risk;  to put  New Jersey air travelers' at risk; and  to deny New Jersey  locally oriented  weather service.  At worst, we have a case of less Gov ernment for greater cost, as the De partment will have to hire new people  in New York and elsewhere to pick up  some  of Newark's  functions, while  paying contractors to conduct observa tions in New Jersey.  For all these reasons, I offered and  the report includes language that di rects the Department to cease its ef forts to contract out weather observa tions at Newark, and to close down the  station. It directs the Department not  to proceed with its plan or otherwise  reorganize weather service  functions  at Newark unless it first secures the  Committee's prior approval. Last, the  language requires the Department to  supply the analysis that has been lack ing thus far on how existing weather  service  and  public  safety  functions  would be continued, what impact the  contracting out would have, and what  real cost savings would result.  Mr. President, I am pleased that the  report includes this important provi sion, preserving essential weather serv ice to northern New Jersey. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.e  e ",1985
412,Senate,99,0.068,141,22,Mr. SPECTER.,"  Mr.  President,  House Report No. 99-197 directs the  ""*     Census Bureau  CENSUS BUREAU  cease  to  re99-150  search and valuation efforts of non cash benefits, which are inkind bene fits  received as  food  stamps, school  lunches, Medicare, public housing, em ployer contributions for pension and  health  plans,  and  other  forms."".  Senate Report No.  reaffirms  the commitment of the Congress, as  expressed in Public Law 96-536,  to a  Census Bureau program of collecting  data  on  participation  in  federally  funded, inkind benefit programs.  Mr. President, I do not agree with  the suggestion of the House that we  should cease  research and valuation  effort on the measurement of noncash  benefits. However, I believe legitimate  concerns have been raised regarding  the methods used in determining the  value of inkind benefits, as well as the  extent to which specific noncash bene fits are included in the official income  data series of the Census Bureau. I be lieve  it  is  important  that, until  the  many conceptual and empirical prob lems associated with the valuation of  inkind  benefits  are  resolved,  the  Census Bureau carefully distinguish  between studies of such income and  official  income data series.  I would  also be seriously concerned about any  effort by any agency to determine pro gram  eligibility, benefit  levels,  pro gram allocations, and so forth on the  basis of such relatively untested data.  Moreover,  in carrying out Congress'  mandate  to study inkind benefits as  income, the Census Bureau should be  encouraged to obtain advice not only  from technical experts, but also from  the general scientific community,  in terested  citizens,  and  congressional  committees that care to participate.  I  believe  these views  express  the  intent of Congress in adopting Public  Law  I would welcome  the  thoughts of the distinguished subcom mittee chairman on these matters.  ",1985

415,,99,-0.362,232,22,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. Speaker, next year will  mark the 350th anniversary of the U.S. Na tional Guard, an organization of citizen soldiers whose members have defended this  country since before its  independence. To  honor this remarkable record of service, I  recently cosponsored a resolution (H. Res.  245), introduced by Representative THOMAS  HARTNETT, of South Carolina, which would  call upon the Postmaster General to issue a  commemorative stamp  to honor  the Na tional Guard.  The National Guard was organized  in  Boston in 1636 as a local militia. Later, of  course,  the Guard defended  the colonists  against  the British during  the American  Revolution, and has fought  in every war,  and  almost  every  battle,  since. But  al though I support this effort to celebrate the  National Guard's anniversary,  I am sure  my colleagues agree, it is insufficient honor  to mark such an illustrious history.  We in Illinois can share in our Nation's  pride on the Natonal Guard's anniversary,  for  the  Illinois National Guard  is very  nearly as old.  It also boasts  two former  Presidents of the United States among its  ranks.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The Illinois National Guard was born in  1712 as the Provincial Militia of the Illinois  District of the Province of Louisiana, when  the territory still belonged to the French. It  was organized by Pierre Duque Boisbriant  in Cahokia and Kaskaskia. Territorial mili tiamen joined the fight against the British  in the Revolution, and our State National  Guard has served in every American con flict since.  The Illinois Military and Naval Depart ment, which comprises the Illinois National  Guard, has published a fascinating account  of the National Guard careers of two of our  State's most famous citizens, Abraham Lin coln and Ulysses Grant. A pamphlet au thored by Dr. Wayne C. Temple highlights  the contributions they made through their  service in the Guard.  Abraham Lincoln and a  group of his  friends answered  the Governor's call  for  volunteers to fight in the Black Hawk War,  and Lincoln was appointed captain of his  rag-tag regiment near Pleasant Plains, IL,  on April 21, 1832. The regiment immediate ly set off for Beardstown, but their planned  encounter with the Indians never material ized. In fact,  later in his career, Lincoln  joked that mosquitoes caused his only loss  of blood in the Black Hawk campaign.  Although Lincoln remained a member of  the Illinois National Guard for the rest of  his  life, his next promotion, according to  Dr. Temple, came on March 4, 1861, when  he became President and Commander-in Chief of the entire U.S. Army Forces. Cer tainly, that was the biggest promotion in  U.S. history.  Ulysses Grant  began  his  service  in  Springfield, at  the outbreak of the Civil  War. Gov. Richard Yates, impressed by the  fact that Grant had attended West Point,  made Grant his military aide and gave him  a desk job in the adjutant general's office.  Grant, however, wanted to see combat, and  in June 1861, Governor Yates gave Grant  his commission, as colonel of 21st Infantry  Regiment  of  the  Illinois State Militia.  Grant proved himself well, and rose quick ly through the ranks. He was promoted to  brigadier general  later  in 1861, and  took  command of the entire Union Army  less  than 3 years  later. Surprisingly,  though,  Grant was not made a  full general until  1866-after the Civil War had ended.  In  1869, he too became President of the United  States and Commander-in-Chief.  Today, the Illinois National Guard is at  the disposal of the Governor and the Presi dent, and helps to maintain order in time  of storm, public disorder, or other emer gency. The State spends about $4 million  annually for the National Guard, while the  Federal Government contributes more than  $52 million. Men and women between the  ages of 17 and 35 are eligible to join, and  serve one weekend each month and 2 weeks  each year.  The National Guard also offers a full col lege scholarship and job training to high  school students, age 17 and older. Students  are eligible in their junior year, and can re ceive  immediate  pay  and  training  one  weekend  per month while  they  finish  school. Upon  graduation,  they  continue  November 1, 1985  weekend service, but also can receive a full  4-year scholarship to any Illinois State-run  college or university.  The National Guard provides an excellent  opportunity for national service, and repre sents  the highest  ideal of the citizen-sol dier.  HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SOVIET  UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE  HON. JACK F. KEMP  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 30, 1985  ",1985
416,,99,0.3,232,22,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, first of all,  would  like to thank my good friend and  colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey,  JIM COURTER, for giving us this opportuni ty  to  focus attention on  the continuing  human rights violations taking place in the  Soviet Union. The  timing  is crucial; our  representatives are presently meeting at the  cultural forum in Budapest with the repre sentatives of the other 34 countries who  signed the Helsinki Final Act, and we are  on the threshold of the meeting in Geneva  between  President Reagan  and General  Secretary Gorbachev. We have also recent ly heard encouraging news about the possi bility of a 3-month exit visa for Dr. Elena  Bonner for medical treatment.  I interpret the news about Dr. Bonner as  a possible sign that perhaps the Soviets do  not wish to appear as intransigent as they  have in the past. However, I think we, as a  people, must be careful not to be taken in  by Gorbachev's apparent charm,  facility  with words, and ability  to deal with  the  press. The Soviets finally have someone in  power who knows the value of good public  relations but we cannot let an affable de meanor and a Western attitude toward the  press cloud the real issues. We need to see  real progress in the area of human rights  before we can even think about any agree ment.  This is why linkage is so important. Any  agreement we enter into with the Soviets  must be predicated on a prior and concur rent condition of tangible human rights ef forts. Dr. Bonner's exit visa may appear to  be a kind act, but it is no more than what  any  civilized  country would  have done  years ago. I must also point out that this is  only one visa, and there are hundreds of  thousands waiting to  leave. Dr. Bonner's  visa is only temporary, and even if it were  permanent, it would be valueless without a  corresponding exit permit for her husband,  Dr. Andrei Sakharov. And one for Anatoly  Shcharansky and one for Ida Nudel and  one for Josef Begun and one for Vladimir  Volvovsky and one for each of the hun dreds of thousands of refuseniks and pris oners of conscience, Christian and Jewish  and any other ethnic or religious minority.  And one  for each  individual who would  wish to leave but feared the reprisals of a  punitive and repressive system.  ",1985
417,,99,-0.596,245,22,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to  submit  for my colleagues' review ex cerpts  from  an  article  published  last  Sunday in The New York Times Magazine.  ""The World Ahead: Black Parents Prepare  Their Children For Pride and Prejudice""  examines black parents and their changing  responsibilities as  teachers of racial and  ethnic identity. It also describes the current  attitudes of black youth and their level of  awareness of racial discrimination.  The article was of particular interest to  me,  since  it  f ea tu res  two of my  good  friends, Dr. Deborah Prothrow, formerly of  Houston and her husband, Rev. Charles R.  Stith, with  their  three children. The ex periences  they  relate as a  contemporary  black family were most informative.  I  urge my  colleagues  to  read  this  thoughtful article.  It provides  invaluable  insight into a little discussed problem.  The article follows:  CFrom the New York Times Magazine, Oct.  27, 1985]  THE WORLD AHEAD; BLACK PARENTS PREPARE  THEIR CHILDREN FOR PRmE AND PllEJuDICE  <By Thomas Morgan>  The memory of the motel sign is still vivid  despite the years. Neatly printed black let ters on white spelled a puzzling message for  a young black boy from suburban St. Louis  traveling with his parents through sleepy  Arkansas  towns with the rural charm of  Norman Rockwell paintings.  The sign read ""Whites Only."" When the  boy asked about it, his mother answered re signedly, ""It means we can't stay  there,  son.""  Nearly 30 years have passed since I saw  that sign and pondered its message. I have  grown and prospered because my father, a  postal employee, and my mother, a public school teacher, sent me, like Moses through  the bulrushes, to the shores of new opportu nity created by the civil-rights movement. I  was one of two blacks to integrate a subur ban elementary school  in 1958. Later, a  White ninth-grade English teacher encour aged me to become a journalist because she  saw a spark of writing talent.  After college,  I  served as an Air Force  Lieutenant and White House military social  aide under President Ford, which allowed  me, in a position other than that of a serv ant, to see the gracious pomp and ceremony  surrounding the First Family. In the late  1960's and early 70's, with the implementa tion of affirmative-action programs, I was  among those blacks who found entry-level  jobs in professions that, for the most part,  had been closed to our parents.  Despite  the advances  race  relations  that my life may exemplify and my close  friendships with several whites, I cannot in  good conscience tell a young black child he  can succeed by merit alone. Nor could I tell  a black child to expect, in general, the same  opportunities as whites, because prejudice,  though waning, lingers.  I still see the sign, ""Whites Only,"" but it is  not hanging  from some Southern motel.  The words ""Whites Only"" come  to mind  when I go as a journalist to cocktail parties  and other events where crucial contacts and  decisions are being made and I am the only  black not serving the hors d'oeuvres. I see  the sign when  I hear racially  insensitive  comments by white acquaintances who pro fess a knowledge of black culture, love the  60's and the Motown sound and reject the  idea of discrimination, but who have no real  black friends or who do not socialized with  blacks outside professional settings.  It is  an  enigma  to me,  a  34-year-old  middle-class black man, because although I  have benefited  from civil-rights advances  and better relationships with whites than  my parents, the reality I see from my own  experiences, and one that is supported by  recent surveys and polls, is that America rein  ",1985

That we have yet to honor those brave  Americans who over 30 years ago traveled  thousands of miles  from our shores  to  defend  freedom and  to deter Communist  aggresion  is regrettable.

There are no costs associated with  the  passage of this legislation. Over 30 years  have passed without suitable recognition,  and it seems that authorizing construction  of a Korean war memorial is most appro priate. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  ",1985
419,House,99,0.26,349,22,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 6, the Water  Resources Conservation, Development,  and Infrastructure Improvement and  Rehabilitation Act of 1985.  H.R. 6 is a  tribute to the full com mittee  chairman,  JIM HOWARD,  the  subcommittee chairman, BoB RoE, and  the  subcommittee  ranking minority  member,  ARLAN  STANGELAND.  These  men,  and many others, have  spent  days and nights over the course of 3  years on  this comprehensive, crucial  legislation.  Their  indepth  analysis  argues  for  the strong support I am  confident H.R. 6 will receive.  The bill before us today is truly a  landmark bill. For example, it takes a  major step in forming a nationally co ordinated water use policy. It also in tegrates, for the first time, the author ization  and  deauthorization  of  all  types of water resource projects with  the establishment of an equitable new  Federal/non-Federal partnership-in cluding  cost-sharing  requirements  where appropriate. H.R. 6 embodies  the belief that Congress can indeed de velop a nationally coordinated policy  that will  ensure maximum benefits  from one of our most vital national  assets-our water resources.  It has been far  too  long since we  have enacted a comprehensive water  resources bill. The  last omnibus bill  became law in 1976, and the last major  water resources construction authori zation law dates back to 1970-15 years  ago. During this period, our water re sources infrastructure has deteriorat ed to the point where it is now in criti cal need of repair, rehabilitation and  improvement. In addition, because no  new projects have been authorized, a  large backlog of proposed water  re source initiatives has accumulated.  Our bill is a bold and innovative at tempt to address these increasing con cerns. The size and scope of H.R. 6  represents over a decade of detailed  planning and study of national water  resource problems. The bill makes nu merous changes in the current water  resources program to respond to new  priorities and the needs of this diverse  Nation. At the same time, it balances  the need for new policies, including in creased non-Fedtral cost-sharing, with  sensitivlty for existing economic condi tions  and  important  environmental  values.  H.R.  6  provides  a  framework  for  strengthening our water resources in frastructure. It authorizes studies for  potential water  resources  projects,  modification of  authorized projects,  and construction of new projects for  the Army Corps of Engineers. Projects  authorized in the bill will strengthen  local, regional, and national economies  and encourage increased trade, which  can improve our balance of payments.  The bill contains programs for assist ance to communities for the construc tion,  repair,  and  rehabilitation  of  water supply systems and for protec tion from flooding and erosion. H.R. 6  also establishes a National Board on  Water Policy to provide a nationwide  source of professional expertise and  cooperation  between Federal, State  and local entities.  In  addition,  the bill  deauthorizes  many older water resources develop ment projects which have not been  constructed and which are no longer  necessary.  At the same time, this is a strong en vironmental bill. It creates a $35 mil lion Environmental Protection Mitiga tion Fund and an Office of Environ mental Policy within the Corps of En gineers  to  formulate and carry out  corps' policy on environmental quality.  Mr. Chairman, allow me to highlight  some of the main features of H.R. 6.  Title I deals with port development. In  addition to authorizing numerous port  projects throughout the country, this  title establishes a $1  billion a year  fund to help finance construction, op eration and maintenance of port and  harbor  improvement  projects.  The  fund would be financed, in part, from  a 0.04 percent ad valorem tax to be  levied on imports and exports which is  expected  to  generate between $150  million and $200 million per year in  new revenues.  The cost-sharing provisions in title I,  so crucial to the continued vitality of  our Nation's harbors,  largely  reflect  the  recent  compromise  reached be tween Senate leaders and the adminis tration. The non-Federal share of con struction costs for port improvement  projects with depths of 14 to 20 feet  would be 10 percent  in cash during  construction, 25 percent for projects  with depths between 20 and 45  feet,  ",1985
420,House,99,-0.06,362,22,Mr. ERDREICH.," Mr. Chairman,  rise in strong support of the bill.  I  know  that  communities  across  America have a keen interest in this  measure, and that also includes Jeffer son County, AL. Jefferson County and  the city of Birmingham which I repre sent have been plagued for decades by  flooding around what is called Village  Creek.  Mr. Chairman, as this committee bill  so ably recognizes, when it rains hard,  Village Creek becomes a raging river  that floods  the  residences and busi nesses located by the sides of it. This  flooding has become not only frequent  but deadly since the 1940's. I spoke to  a man in one part of my district, in the  Ensley neighborhood, who has seen  flood waters rise over the top of his  chain-link  fence  and  neighborhood  dumpsters wash away. And in 1965 a  young man was drowned when  the  creek became a river and rushed down  his neighborhood. By the end of the  1970's the Army Corps of Engineers  estimated that flooding around Village  Creek  resulted  in  annual  property  damages of over $2. 7 million.  Mr. Chairman, it is clear that our  cities alone cannot handle the problem  of severe flooding,  even  though  the  city of Birmingham by itself has spent  $2.5 million beginning in 1930 and has  spent millions of dollars since  then.  This bill addresses this important and  urgent need, and I wholeheartedly en dorse the measure and urge its adop tion.  Mr. HOW ARD.

422,,99,-0.318,492,22,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. Speaker, in the October  29, 1985 edition of the Wall Street Journal,  reporter Jeanne Saddler tells the story of  John Weyrick, an Orlando, FL, small busi nessman who was  able  to obtain more  work,  thanks  to a  new, high-technology  phone gadget that kept track of the tele  phone numbers of everyone who  called  him-even when  they didn't leave a mes  sage.  To me, this story was good news. I'm all  for John Weyrick having access to what  ever new whizbang phone gadgetry he can  November 5, 1985  afford. It helps his business and it helps the  phone company's business.  But it's not right to make senior citizens  and small corner grocery store owners sub sidize John's new high-technology service.  That's why I'm introducing a bill which  will make sure that all the parties-John,  the phone company, the senior citizen, and  the grocer-come out ahead.  Here's how my bill-which I'm calling  the Telephone Ratepayer Protection and  Technology Promotion Act-works.  State utility commissions will be given  the authority to allow local Bell operating  companies  to  provide  new  information  services and to manufacture telecommuni  ~ations equipment. In exchange, the com missions must  first  set  up  regulations  which prevent the phone companies from  using any of the revenues derived from the  provision of basic  local phone service or  other regulated services  to help pay  the  costs of these new services.  Everybody wins under this bill. The el  derly woman pays only for what she gets basic phone service. John Weyrick pays for  what he gets-access to new  technologies  that  improve his business prospects. And  the  local  phone  company  gets what  it  needs-the ability to develop new technol ogies and new services so  thst they can  compete  in  the emerging  telecommunica  tions market.  No one pretends that this bill will single  handedly solve all of the problems  that  have arisen in the wake of the divestiture  of AT&T. We have a  long way  to go  to  ensure that all Americans have access to  affordable phone service, and  that all of  the players in the telecommunications mar ketplace have the ability to compete on a  level playing field.  I do believe, however, that this legislation  symbolizes what we need more of if we are  to solve  those problems: Approaches  that  promote competition in those sectors where  the market will bear it but provide basic  protection in those areas where it will not.  In sum, this bill recognizes that the goals  of universal service and technological inno vation are not incompatible. We can have  affordable  service  for everyone. And we  can foster  the  technological explosion  in  telecommunications.  I believe  that's why  this bill has the support of the Consumer  Federation of America and why I am opti mistic that it will also be favorably received  by the local operating companies.  The text of the bill follows:  H.R. 3687  A bill to permit the Bell operating compa nies to provide information services and to  manufacture  telecommunications  equip ment so long as such services and manu facturing are not subsidized with the pro ceeds from the provision of local exchange  telephone service or other regulated tele communications services  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

423,,99,-0.058,505,22,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, on October  14, 1985, Roy McDonald of Chattanooga,  TN was  awarded  the  coveted Dorothy  Patten ""Love of Chattanooga"" award.  Roy McDonald is a true American great.  If the term ""rugged individualist"" had not  already been phrased, it would have when  Mr. McDonald came along. He epitomizes  the admirable concepts of personal faith in  Jesus Christ, love of country, hard work,  meeting challenges head-on, achievement,  and  then  using his  accomplishments  to  help other people.  Roy McDonald was born  in  the  little  town of Graysville in the northern end of  Hamilton County on November 25, 1901. He  remembers the time when it was an over night trip by wagon with this father to get  to Chattanooga. He grew up in Chattanoo ga, helping his father in a family grocery  store and carrying a newspaper route. Both  of these activities were to play a large part  in his life.  From a 70-store grocery chain, which he  developed, sprang a newspaper originally  called  the Chattanooga Free Press. The  paper became a daily  in August of 1936.  Roy McDonald is the founder and publish er of today's Chattanooga News-Free Press,  the community's largest newspaper.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The attributes that made Roy McDonald  successful in business were also beneficial  in his service to this fellow man. Active in  many civic causes, his love for Chattanoo ga has been evidenced for more than eight  decades. For example, he has headed  the  Chamber of Commerce, led the Community  Chest Drive and was chairman of the board  of Erlanger Hospital  for more  than 20  years.  Roy McDonald  is  credited with  bringing prepaid medical insurance to the  community through Blue Cross-Blue Shield  of Tennessee.  A man who has little interest in material  things, he is happiest when facing a chal lenge  and  when  serving  quietly  and  humbly. Always an optimist, always eager  to forge ahead to bigger and better things,  he has been outstanding among the leaders  and the servants of the Chattanooga com munity and its people.  This award  is presented only  to  those  people who have distinguished  themselves  in long-time community service and profes sional activities and by contributing to the  enrichment and development of the com munity apart from the person's business or  professional  life.  I applaud  the choice of  Roy McDonald as this year's recipient.  A TRIBUTE TO DR. AARON  CAPLAN  HON. JOE KOLTER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 5, 1985  ",1985
424,,99,-0.28,505,22,Mr. KOLTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise  to salute a constituent of the Fourth Dis trict of Pennsylvania, Dr. Aaron Caplan.  Dr. Caplan is being honored by American  Legion Post 157 for his exemplary work as  a physician for 50 years and for the his  valor as a combat doctor in World War II.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some in formation about Dr. Caplan with our col leagues.  Dr. Caplan graduated from Lincoln High  School  in  1926. He went on  to  attend  Geneva College in Beaver Falls in 1928 and  1929, concluding his undergraduate work at  the University of Pennsylvania in 1930. In  pursuit of his lifelong dream to be a physi cian, Aaron Caplan  traveled  to Scotland  where he studied medicine at the University  of Glasgow Medical School. After graduat ing with his degree in medicine in 1935, Dr.  Caplan  returned  to Pennsylvania. He  in terned at Passavant Hospital in Pittsburgh  for 1 year after which he returned home to  Ellwood City to open his private practice.  The doctor's office on the second floor at  523 Lawrence Avenue, which was opened in  1936 has proudly remained the workplace  for Dr. Caplan for the past 50 years. Only  once was  the practice of medicine  inter rupted at this location. From April 1941 to  December 1945 Dr. Caplan left the commu nity and his practice to serve his country in  the Army Medical Corps. A major in the  29th Division Artillery, Dr. Caplan served  in Normandy, France and was involved in  D-Day. His efforts earned him the Bronze  30619  Star with oak leaf cluster for meritorious  achievements.  Dr. Caplan's dedication to this communi ty extends beyond his vocation. In 1967 he  was honored by the Jaycees for the Senior  Citizens Distinguished Service Award. That  same year he held the position of chairman  of the Ellwood City borough's diamond ju bilee. He was active in the establishment of  a blood bank program for  the city, was  president of the chamber of commerce in  1965 and was the president of the Ellwood  City Hospital medical staff. He is a charter  member of the Ellwood City Lions Club.  The list of Dr. Caplan's civic accomplish ments  and organization memberships  is  virtually endless. Suffice it to say that Dr.  Caplan is a man of action who has played  an integral part in making Ellwood City a  safer, healthier place to live over the course  of the past 50 years.  In spite of bouts with  illness over the  past 5 years, Dr. Caplan has continued to  service the community diligently, decreas ing his workload by a mere hour each day.  This man of strength has no  immediate  plans for retirement since his concern for  his patients overrides his desire for relax ation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join Ameri can Legion Post 157, his wife Anne, and  their  three  children,  Harvey,  Barbara  Azizio, and Rebekah in honoring Dr. Aaron  Caplan.  CONGRESSIONAL CALL TO  CONSCIENCE  HON. DOUGLAS H. BOSCO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 5, 1985  ",1985
425,,99,-0.271,505,22,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  add my voice  to  those of my colleagues  who are protesting the continued persecu tion and mistreatment of Soviet Jews.

Pavel Astrakhan was born in 1955 and  first applied to emigrate in 1978. He was re fused permission to do so on the grounds  that he ""choose to emigrate without his el derly parents, thus breaking up a family.""  Although Pavel  is  an English  teacher I  translator by profession, he  is unable  to  find work. Thus, he devotes a great deal of  his time to studying the Torah and helping  other Jews process  their applications for  emigration. Pavel is also involved in reli gious seminars which take place unofficial ly and are attended by refusniks and non refusniks. As many as 100 people have at tended these seminars at one time; howev er, a  tourist has reported that attendance  has begun  to drop off because of KGB  raids on  the homes where seminars are  held. Pavel lives in Leningrad with his wife  Sonya  and  their  two-year-old  daughter  Ruth.

431,,99,0.497,804,22,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr. Speaker, over  the  last 7 years I have become quite involved  with  the  immigration  reform  i11ue as a  member of the Judiciary Committee's SubNovember 6, 1985  committee on Immigration, Refugees, and  International Law. When  initial Federal  legislation  to  address  the  immigration  problem surfaced in 1972 and 1973 it was  piecemeal in nature. Since that time it has  become evident that the broad nature of  the problem  requires a  solution with an  equally  comprehensive  scope.  Elements  that make up an immigration reform bill  must be crafted  to work  in concert with  each other. If we are going to demagnetize  the attraction of unlawful employment in  the United States, we must have sanctions  with respect to employers who knowingly  hire those who come here without benefit  of papers.  At the same time if we have sanctions, we  must not put those who have developed a  dependency on undocumented labor in the  position of intentionally violating the law  or going out of business if they are unable  to find a sufficient level of domestic labor.  We must have a workable temporary For eign Worker Program for agriculture that  is regulated to protect the rights of Ameri can workers as well as those who partici  pate in the program.  The argument is being voiced by  those  who are opposed to an organized Agricul tural Guest Worker Program that Califor nia growers are simply looking for a plenti ful supply of cheap labor. However, that ar gument is ignoring the reality of the status  quo.  Former  INS Commissioner Leonel  Castillo best characterized the current situ  ation in stating that:  The U.S. is experiencing the world's larg est temporary worker program, larger than  the guest worker programs in France, Hol land and Germany. Only ours is unregulat ed . . . resulting in the Immigration Service  having to arrest over a million persons an nually . . . whose crime is that they want to  work in this country.  I urge my colleagues to read the follow ing article which appeared in the Washing ton Post on October 31. This article reveals  the plight of the California grower with a  small operation, and why many of them  can't use  thousands of  the unemployed  workers available. Also, it is pointed out by  the reporter that wrote this article, current ly workers have no protection under the  law and that some growers have housed mi  grant workers in caves and paid less than  minimum wage.  The article reads as follows:  CALIFORNIA GROWERS LoOK TO CONGRESS l'OR  PICKERS  l'OREIGN GUEST WORKER PROVISION BACKED  <By Jay Mathews>  Fu:sNo, CA.-When members of Congress  and  labor  leaders ask Harry Kubo why  Fresno arowers need more Mexican laborers  to pick their raisins and strawberries, when  they ask why can't he use the thousands of  unemployed workers already here, he tells  this story:  One day last summer a member of the  Nisei Farmers League, the growers group of  which Kubo ls president, asked if he could  find 30 workers to pick 20 acres of grapes  for raisins when they ripened in a month.  Kubo called Doreen Caetano, a job develop er for a local community of Laotian immi grants, who said it could be done.  ",1985
432,,99,-0.318,830,22,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today  to  commend my  colleague  from  New  Jersey, Congressman BOB TORRICELLI  for  his vigorous efforts to protect the quality  of life of our elderly citizens. The following  article from the Record newspaper in New  Jersey was prompted by Congressman TOR  RICELLl's concern about questions  rising  from  the  investigation of nursing home  care in his Bergen County, NJ, area.  Without Congressman TORRICELLl's per severence and concern  it  is unlikely that  the issue would have received the wide atNovember 6, 1985  tention which it did. I commend the article  to all of my colleagues.  The article follows:  [From the Record <NJ>. Oct. 14, 1985]  NURSING-HOME SLEUTHS-INVESTIGATORS ARE  NEEDED To WATCH OuT FoR BAD Guys  <By Bruce Locklin and Gale Scott>  For two years the Institute of Medicine  has been commissioning research papers for  the federal government on how to improve  the nation's nursing homes. In the piles of  words and statistics, a conclusion jumps out:  Bad nursing-home operators will continue  to neglect patients until they become con vinced  that government has a  system  in  place that will uncover neglect-and until  punishments are stiff enough that no one  wants to face them.  The bad guys have to know that they'll  get caught and punished severely. But in  New Jersey and most of the nation no one is  actively chasing them.  The traditional approach to nursing-home  enforcement  relies  on  inspectors,  people  trained in measuring a home against estab lished standards. There are several types of  inspectors: nurses, nutritionists, sanitarians.  They're visitors with checklists. They usual ly can determine  if a home  is complying  with regulations, but they don't have any  training in collecting evidence of wrongdo ing. They've never been instructed on how  to find or interview witnesses.  Inspectors simply don't have the tools to  cope with a corrupt nuring-home operator  who fakes records and intimidates staff and  patients.  New  Jersey's Health Commissioner,  Jr.  Richard Goldstein knows that his troops are  not up to the task of building cases against  bad homes.  ""We are not in the testimony-taking busi ness,"" Goldstein said in an inverview. ""We  are in the direct-inspecting business.""  What New Jersey and most other states  need  is  an effective  investigating agency  that will catch enough bad guys to scare the  hell out of the rest.  Referring nursing-home cases to existing  prosecuting  agencies  doesn't work.  Jack  Fay, New Jersey's former nursing-home om budsman, tried unsuccessfully for years to  get county prosecutors excited about ne glect-and-abuse cases. The prosecutors were  polite but not  really  interested, and Fay  became convinced that they saw their duty  as  chasing  ""real  criminals"" -murderers,  thieves, and the rest.  The  enforcement  vacuum  in  nursing  homes across  the country  is  astonishing,  particularly because it's easy to prove that a  bad nursing home is a bad nursing home.  The practical experience of investigating  the two Bel Air Manor nursing homes  in  New Jersey for The Record has given us  some insight into what it takes to expose  nursing-home wrongdoing.  We're not nursing-home experts or policy  planners. But as reporters who spent seven  months building evidence of nursing-home  neglect, we  think we may have  found a  methodology  that any state could use  to  clear up its nursing homes and make sure  they stay cleaned up.  The approach we're suggesting is similar  to what the Justice Department did several  years ago, when it decided to pursue mob  figures with the strike-force concept, setting  up an agency designed to go out and find  evidence.  ",1985
433,,99,-0.422,843,22,Mr. PEPPER.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to introduce today a joint resolution of the  Congress  designating March  2  through  March 8, 1986, as ""National Back Aware ness Week."" Provided that this resolution  meets with the approval of both bodies of  the Congress  and  the President of  the  United States, it will call upon all Govern ment agencies and the people of the Nation  to observe this week with appropriate pro grams and activities.  At any given time, some 75 million Amer icans suffer with back pain. The elderly are  particularly vulnerable to this lncapacitat  ing ailment.  According to the American Back Society,  more than 400,000 people injure their backs  on  the job yearly, and  the average back  injury results in 97 lost work days; $14 bll  lion is spent on the treatment and compen  sation of back injury each year, and 8 out  of 1 O Americans will experience back pain  at some point in their lives.  Exercise, performed  judiciously and as  prescribed by a health professional, can  have a beneficial effect. Proper posture can  provide relief for back pain. Patients can  be  taught  to avoid movements  that can  injure the back. Certain ways of managing  stress can reduce strain on the back, and  proper nutrition appears to bring relief in  certain individuals.  I believe that National Back Awareness  Week can be an  important step  toward  bringing care of the back into the public  consciousness. We need  to mobilize those  interested  in back disorders,  in order to  educate the public and the health care com munity as to the seriousness of back prob lems. Orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons,  physical therapists, radiologists, chiroprac tors,  exercise  physiologists,  neurologists,  nurses-these are but a few of the profes sions for whom care of the back is an im portant  concern. By  enacting National  Back Awareness Week, we will be able to  provide these persons and their patients and all other interested persons-informa tion relative to the treatment, prevention,  and control of disorders associated with  the back.  I would  like to  thank Dr. David Lehr man, a respected surgeon and constituent  of mine from Miami Beach, FL, for bring ing to my attention  information on back  problems. Dr. Lehrman has been especially  active trying to educate Americans regard ing back pain and how to relieve it.  Back pain has reached epidemic propor tions and has become a major public health  threat to the life and economy of our coun try. However, education and awareness can  have a significant impact on the prevention  and alleviation of back pain. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this resolution to  establish National Back Awareness Week.  The text of the resolution follows:  H.J. RES. 444  Joint Resolution to designate the week of  Mach 3, 1986, to March 10, 1986, as Na tional Back Awareness Week  Whereas 75,000,000 Americans are suffer ing with back pain;  Whereas more than 400,000 people injure  their backs on the job yearly;  Whereas the average back injury results  in 97 lost work days;  Whereas $14,000,000,000  is spent on the  treatment and compensation of back inju ries each year;  Whereas back pain has reached epidemic  proportions, and has become a major public  health threat to the quality of life and econ omy of our country; and  Whereas education and awareness make a  significant impact on the prevention and al leviation of back pain; Now, therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled, That the week of  March 3, 1986, to March 10, 1986, is desig nated National Back Awareness Week.

435,House,99,-0.058,869,22,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I  intend  to  vote for this conference report. Though the  funding  is above  the President's request,  the difference lies mainly in three impor tant areas that I believe need the level set  by the conferees.  While the Congress is debating trade and  tax reform, the administration is request ing inadequate funding for both the IRS  and the Customs Service. A report just this  week indicated that voluntary tax compli ance is down. While this is surely due in  part to frustration with the current code, it  occurs to me that it just might also be be cause enforcement  is being neglected.  In  fact,  the administration had proposed  to  cut over 1,000 position:.J from the IRS. This  report provides  for 1,800  additional  IRS  staff positions. The first step toward a fair  tax is one that is equally enforced and that  can only be accomplished with adequate  staff.  The same can be said for the Customs  Service. The adminstration has repeatedly  told us existing trade laws can address the  threat of imports. Americans, particularly  in the textile industry in my district, are  losing jobs because imports are pouring in.  The House has passed legislation to protect  these jobs, but the administration opposes  that effort saying agreements are already  in place. Those agreements are meaningless  if they are not enforced and they cannot be  enforced without Customs Service person nel. This administration had proposed a cut  of 887 positions. That prospect is stagger ing. The Government Operations Commit tee has reviewed the enforcement of textile  and apparel import quotas and has found  that, despite an elaborate system of inter ndional agreements, the U.S. has failed to  prevent import disruption of its domestic  markets. Further, we have failed  to stop  the evasion of those agreements. Because  of increasing workloads and staff short ages, the Service is unable to prevent viola tions of the restraint system causing seri ous injury to the domestic textile industry.  We need to increase, not decrease, our Cus toms Service staff. They produce revenue,  $21.06  for  every  appropriated dollar  in  1984. I'm extremely pleased that this report  provides 473 positions, bringing the total to  over 14,000.  I urge  the adoption of the  report and  would call on the President to see the con sistency of his policies in it.  ",1985

Stapp will go down in history on many  achievements, but one that stands out was  his deflation of a Colorado politician by an  outrageous device. He quoted him accurate ly.  Gene Amole  in  the Rockey Mountain  News and Tom Gavin  in the Denver Post  wrote  fondly of  their good  friend Bob  Stapp.  [From The Rocky Mountain News. Nov. 3,  1985]  REMEMBERING A SUPERB WRITER  <By Gene Amole)  Anarchy.  When Ben Bezoff learned he had cancer  in 1978, Bob Stapp and I began  to have  lunch with him every week or so  to help  keep up his spirits. We'd meet at the Golden  Ox, spend a couple of hours eating, talking,  and having a few.  After Ben died, we were two.  Bob and I kept the tradition. It had a lot  to do with our affection for Ben. But of  course we had always enjoyed each other.  Have you noticed that as you grow older  how difficult it  is  to find people you can  really talk to?  Maureen Stapp, Bob's wife of 44 years,  called Friday to tell me he had died the  night before of a heart attack. He was 71.  She was grateful there was no suffering.  Now we are one.  What a superb writer he was! As a report er  for The Denver Post  and  the Rocky  Mountain News, Bob crafted some of the  sharpest, funniest satire any one has ever  done in this or any other town.  He was  particularly  deft  at  deflating  puffed politicos. Bob caused the defeat of a  powerful Colorado congressman simply by  accurately quoting him in a story for the  News. Bob put  in every pause, every stum ble, each snortle and every incomplete sen tence the old boy uttered in a speech.  Of government in general, Bob once asked  Charlie Roos, ""Over  the years everybody  has  badmouthed  anarchy,  but have we  really given it a chance?""  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The circumstances of Bob's resignation  from  the Post  are worth  remembering.  After promising him he would cover  the  Democratic National Convention, Post man agement decided at the last minute to send  the son of the publisher instead.  Angry and hurt, Bob told City Editor Will  Haselbush he was quitting and stalked out  of the newsroom. Not wanting to lose one of  his most talented writers, Haselbush sent  another reporter, Thor Severson, to Bob's  house to try to talk him into coming back.  Bob was still in a rage when Severson ar rived. They went to the kitchen to talk. The  more Bob thought about it, the angrier he  got. It wasn't long before Severson became  as furious at the injustice as Bob. An hour  later, Severson picked up  the  telephone,  called the city desk and also quit.  After leaving ""the newspaper game,"" as  Bob called it, he wrote a novel, ""A More  Perfect Union,"" and worked in Washington  as an administrative assistant to Congress men Roy McVicker and Byron Rogers. He  was director of  information at Stapleton  International Airport and a political confi dante  and  strategist  for  former Denver  Mayor William McNichols.  For the record, his name was Robert R.  Stapp. But the name for which the middle  initial stood was not. He hated it and never  told anyone what it was.  Memorial services will be held 11  a.m.  Monday at the Church of the Risen Christ,  3090 S. Monaco Parkway.  Quote courtesy Tom Gavin: ""I have been  trying to live down my newspaper record for  20 years, but somebody always dredges it up  again. Actually, it wasn't even my fault in  the first place. Because I grew up in a poor  neighborhood, it was natural I would drift  into petty crime and then into the newspa per business.""-Bob Stapp.  [From The Denver Post, Nov. 3, 1985]  HIS DROLLERY LIVES AFTER HIM  like Bob  <By Tom Gavin)  Bob Stapp dead? Nah. People  Stapp don't die.  Oh, he is dead all right. Gone. Shuffled  off this mortal coil. Gone to glory. Clasped  in the arms of Jesus. Choose your own eu phemism.  Robert R. Stapp. Former newspaperman.  Former congressional aide. Former PR man  for Stapleton International Airport. Dead at  71 of an apparent heart attack.  He's not dead for me, though, and never  will be. Someone said we never die so long as  we are remembered and, whew, I'd hate to  think how many people have lively memo ries of this jasper.  No, make that laughing memories.  Say the word ""Stapp"" to an acquaintance  of Bob Stapp and probably that person will  smile. And then grin. And then laugh aloud  as  recall of some drollery works  its way  clear of the memory bank and breaks into  the open.  The last time I saw him he announced at  lunch that he'd been dieting and that he'd  lost 11 pounds and a ring from his finger  and went right into an entirely different  conversational line. With Stapp you had to  pay attention. You also had to keep your  left up and your chin tucked in to keep from  being tagged, for, like a lot of my friends,  now that I  think of it, he could pink you  with a little personal thrust, too, and never  change expression then, either.  ALL IN OUR PLACES  I'll be at Bob Stapp's memorial service at  11 a.m. Monday at the Church of the Risen  31529  Christ, 3090 S. Monaco. You bet. If there's  one thing I like it's a good laugh.  Sounds dreadful, doesn't it? Yeah. Excuse  me. But, listen, most of my friends are news papermen and they are a peculiar bunch.  They are seldom solemn at funerals. They  whisper wry, puckish things to one another,  usually about the dear departed, while in  the church proper, and, once outside, say  pretty much the same things aloud. There  are chortles and laughs. It is most unseem ly.  It's also healthy, I  think, for  tears and  chuckles are never far apart in this life, are  they? Does it hurt? Only when I laugh.  I didn't bring you here  to  talk about  friends who make you smile, though. Prob ably you've got your own set. What I wish  to do  is share a  few of  the  remarks of  Robert R. Stapp, recorded here and there  over the years.  LIKE THESE  As a candidate for mayor in 1959: ""My  campaign has contributed something to the  moral of the people. it's been a source of  limitless merriment.  I  feel  there  is now  greater solidarity among the citizens than  at any time since Pearl Harbor. Everyone's  against me.""  Addressing a meeting of newspaper edi tors: ""it is a high honor to be here with you  molders of public opinion. I must say you've  done a wonderful job. I doubt if public opin ion has ever been as moldy as it is today.""  Addressing his own Stapleton retirement  party: ""I see some of my ex-colleagues here  from my old newspaper days. These people  are  implacable.  I've retired  four or  five  times since then, but I can see they're going  to hound me to my grave. I've been trying  to live down my newspaper record for 20  years, but somebody always dredges it up.  And acutally it wasn't even my fault in the  first place, because  I grew up  in a poor  neighborhood and  it was natural  that  I  would drift into petty crime and then into  the newspaper business.""  Miss him? Yes. A lot. But he is not dead.  Forget that ""dead"" business.  Bob Stapp may live forever.  FOREIGN AGENTS COMPULSORY  ETHICS IN TRADE ACT OF 1985  HON.

462,,99,-0.547,1441,22,Mr. BONIOR of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  since the election of President Duarte, we  have all hoped for a strengthening of de mocracy and the prospects for peace in El  Salvador. Yet, these hopes must not blind  us to that country's continuing war and the  suffering of its people.  Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans  have fled  to neighboring countries or the  United States, fearing for their safety. The  recent kidnaping of the President's daugh ter, and attacks by the Honduran military  on a Salvadoran refugee camp are graphic  illustrations of how violence threatens the  life of every Salvadoran.  Under such conditions,  it  is  imperative  for the United States to grant extended vol untary departure status to the Salvadorans  who have sought refuge in our country. I  commend Chairman MAzZOLI for the hear ings he held on this legislation last week.  And I urge my colleagues to support the   Moakley bill to grant Salvadorans a tempo rary stay of deportation.
