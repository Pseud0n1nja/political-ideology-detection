0,6,2004-01-20,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Speaker, as I rise  today, over 500 Americans have  lost  their lives in the war in Iraq. Each loss  is a wrenching tragedy to a  family  somewhere in America, and this tragic  loss has now come to the Mihalakis  family in San Jose, California.  U.S. Army National Guard Specialist  Michael G. Mihalakis of San Jose, California, was killed the day after Christmas when his Humvee overturned near  the Baghdad International Airport. He  was assigned to the 270th Military Police Company  and was  one  of  the  youngest casualties of the Iraq conflict. Michael was proud to be a soldier,  with a strong commitment to service,  an unflinching bravery, a dedication to  family, and a deep love of country.  America remains strong and free because, for generations, Americans like  Michael have been willing to put the  well-being  of  their  community  and  country ahead of their personal comfort and safety. From towns and cities  all  over America,  ordinary  citizens  have become transformed into heroes  through their service.  There is aching loss and pain when  such heroism means the hero is not  coming home. This wrenching loss can  never really be healed for the mothers  and  fathers who have given what  is  most precious to them for their country. We want to thank the Mihalakis  family and let them know they are in  our hearts and prayers and that his  grateful country will always remember  their son.  On behalf of the House of Representatives, I want to thank Michael for his  service to the United States and offer  heartfelt condolences  to his parents  and entire family.  f  REAL IMMIGRATION REFORM  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, the State of the Union will be  an opportunity  for the President to  push his issues and to explain to the  American people how we can work together.  I think there is no doubt that there  are those of us who understand that  this Nation was first built on the opportunities  for  immigrants  to come  and to seek, if you will, a better life.  We do need real immigration reform  in this Nation, but I am disappointed  and saddened by the offering of the  President of which I have said this is  not an amnesty plan, and so I defend  him from the perspective that this is a  first step of recognizing the needs for  immigration  reform,  but we  really  need to focus on earned access to legalization  for  those millions of  immigrants who  are here  paying  taxes,  working every day and wanting to provide for their family and to get in line  to be able to earn their right to be a  citizen of the United States of America.  What happens to a guest worker program? It literally disappears into the  night because when the program ends  after 3 years, there is some suggestion  that these individuals will go home.  They will not.  Mr. President, work with this Congress, work with the Democrats in a bipartisan way to lift up the values of  this Nation, that we are a land of immigrants, to allow the immigrants that  are here to get  into the system of  earned access to legalization.  f  THE DRUG COVERAGE BILL  (Mr. BROWN of Ohio asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2004
1,6,2004-01-20,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  President Bush,  in his State of the  Union a year ago, said, ‘‘Medicare is  the binding commitment of a caring  society.’’ He then promised a prescription drug/Medicare reform bill.  The gentleman from California (Mr.  THOMAS), the Republican chairman of  the House Committee on Ways and  Means, one of the authors of the bill  with the Bush administration, said, ‘‘to  those who say this bill would end Medicare as we know it, our answer is we  certainly hope so.’’ b1300  I wish President Bush tonight would  explain what happened to the Medicare  bill that he signed in December. I wish  he would explain that this legislation  will mean $139 billion, that is with a  ‘‘B,’’ $139 billion additional profits for  the drug industry. I wish he would explain tonight to the American people  why this Medicare privatization bill  means $14 billion in extra payouts to  the HMOs and to the insurance companies. And I wish he would explain to  the American people why he let in to  write this bill the drug industry and  the insurance industry, which sat down  with the administration, with Republican leadership and actually wrote the  Medicare prescription drug privatization bill. We need answers tonight, Mr.  Speaker. f  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA VOTING  RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT  (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks and include therein extraneous material.)  ",2004
2,6,2004-01-20,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker, I  have just introduced the District of Columbia Voting Rights Restoration Act,  a bill to restore full and equal congressional  voting  rights,  including  representation in the United States Senate, for the residents of the District of  Columbia.  My bill would restore the Federal  rights of Maryland  citizenship  that  were taken away from the District of  Columbia residents over 200 years ago  by an Act of Congress, the Organic Act  of 1801. Enactment of my bill would  mean that D.C. residents would once  again have  the  full Federal voting  rights they enjoyed as Maryland citizens prior to Congress’ assumption of  exclusive legislative authority over the  District of Columbia. Those rights included the right to vote for and to be  elected as and to serve as U.S. senators, U.S. representatives and presidential electors from Maryland.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle not to let small  national political considerations stop  us from restoring these rights, and I  would also insert the questions and answers about my bill that I am putting  on  the desk  today as part of  the  RECORD. Mr. Speaker, it is time for all Members of  Congress, whether Republican or Democrat,  conservative or liberal, to heed the legitimate  complaints of  ‘taxation without  representation.’ ’ We must correct this 200-year-old injustice to the U.S. citizens who live in our nation ’s capital. The debate must no longer be  about whether D.C. residents should have full  voting rights in Congress, but how to accomplish a goal that we all share. Question. Since the VRRA includes D.C. as  part of the Maryland delegation in the U.S.  House, what is to keep the Maryland legislature from splitting D.C. and joining it with  two or more Maryland congressional districts?  Answer. The VRRA would  require  that  whenever D.C. has fewer people than the average Maryland congressional district, D.C.  be kept intact in a single congressional district, with contiguous territory from adjacent Maryland counties added as necessary  to produce a district equal in population to  the other Maryland districts. The VRRA also  provides that whenever D.C.’s population is  equal to or larger than the average Maryland  district, then there must be at lease one district that is 100% D.C.  The controlling Supreme Court opinion in  Oregon v. Mitchell (the 18-year-old vote case)  made clear that Congress has the power to  regulate congressional redistricting by state  legislatures. Congress  has  exercised  this  power  in prohibiting at-large districts  in  states with more than one House member. In  this case, Congress would protect D.C. from  unfair  treatment  because D.C.  residents  would have no voice in the Maryland legislature.  Question. Does the Constitution allow D.C.  residents who do not actually live in Maryland to choose the representatives of that  state? If it were constitutional to treat D.C.  residents as if they were residents of the  state of Maryland for the purposes of voting,  would D.C. residents be constitutionally precluded from representing the new Maryland  district, given the language of Article I specifically requiring that representatives be  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:00 Jan 21, 2004 Jkt 29060 PO 00000 Frm 000006 Fmt 04634 Sfmt 00634 E:\CR\FM\K20JA7.022 H20PT1 ‘ ",2004
3,13,2004-01-20,Mr.  CUMMINGS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentlewoman for her statement.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to a friend of the  Congressional Black Caucus, the gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  MCDERMOTT).  ",2004
4,13,2004-01-20,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman very much  for  yielding. I think that as we prepare for  this evening, the necessity of putting  up a minority report on the state of  the Union is crucial for the American  people.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article from the Independent, which  is a major newspaper  in the United  Kingdom, called ‘‘George W.

5,20,2004-01-20,The PRESIDENT.," Mr. Speaker, Vice  President CHENEY, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow  citizens:  America  this evening  is a Nation  called to great responsibilities. And we  are rising to meet them.  As we gather tonight, hundreds of  thousands of American servicemen and  women are deployed across the world  in the war on terror. By bringing hope  to the oppressed and delivering justice  to the violent, they are making America more secure.  Each day, law enforcement personnel  and intelligence officers are tracking  terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men  and women of our new Department of  Homeland Security are patrolling our  coasts and borders. And their vigilance  is protecting America.  Americans are proving once again to  be the hardest working people in the  world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed  is working.  Tonight, Members of Congress can  take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had  thought  impossible. You are  raising  the standards for our public schools;  and you are giving our senior citizens  prescription drug coverage under Medicare.  We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice. We  can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not  plotting and outlaw regimes are no  threat to us. We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education  and Medicare, or we can turn back to  old policies and old divisions.  We have not  come all  this way,  through  tragedy and  trial and war,  only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the  tasks of history, and they expect the  same from us. In their efforts, their enterprise,  and  their  character,  the  American people are showing that the  state of our Union  is confident and  strong.  Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people.  Twenty-eight months have passed since  September 11, 2001, over 2 years without an attack on American soil, and it  is tempting to believe that the danger  is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting, and false. The killing  has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem,  Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists  continue to plot against America and  the civilized world. And by our will and  courage, this danger will be defeated.  Inside the United States, where the  war began, we must continue to give  our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to  defend us. And one of those essential  tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal law enforcement to better  share information, to track terrorists,  to disrupt their cells, and to seize their  assets. For years, we have used similar  provisions  to  catch  embezzlers  and  drug traffickers. If these methods are  good for hunting criminals, they are  even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the PATRIOT  Act are set to expire next year. The  terrorist threat will not expire on that  schedule. Our law enforcement needs  this vital  legislation to protect our  citizens. You need to renew the PATRIOT Act.  America is on the offensive against  the terrorists who started this war.  Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September 11,  awoke to find himself in the custody of  U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last  August 11 brought the capture of the  terrorist Hambali, who was a key player  in  the attack  in  Indonesia  that  killed over 200 people. We are tracking  al Qaeda around the world, and nearly  two-thirds of their known leaders have  now been captured or killed. Thousands  of very skilled and determined military  personnel are on a manhunt, going  after the remaining killers who hide in  cities and caves; and one by one, we  will bring these terrorists to justice.  As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  The United States and our allies are  determined: we refuse to live in the  shadow of this ultimate danger.  The first to see our determination  were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of al  Qaeda killers. As of this month, that  country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women. Businesses are opening, health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With help  from the new Afghan army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against  surviving members of the Taliban and  al Qaeda. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is  free and proud and fighting terror, and  America is honored to be their friend.  Since we last met in this Chamber,  combat  forces of the United States,  Great Britain, Australia, Poland and  other countries enforced the demands  of the United Nations, ended the rule of  Saddam Hussein; and the people of Iraq  are free. Having broken the Baathist  regime, we face a remnant of violent  Saddam supporters. Men who ran away  from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.  These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger. Yet we  are making  progress  against them. The once all-powerful  ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and  now sits in a prison cell. Of the top 55  officials of the former regime, we have  captured or killed 45. Our forces are on  the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols  a day and conducting an average of 180  raids every week. We are dealing with  these thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we  dealt with Saddam Hussein’s evil regime.  The work of building a new Iraq is  hard, and it is right. And America has  always been willing to do what it takes  for what is right. Last January, Iraq’s  only law was the whim of one brutal  man. Today our coalition is working  with the Iraqi Governing Council to  draft a basic law with a bill of rights.  We are working with Iraqis and the  United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the  end of June. As democracy takes hold  in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do  all in their power to spread violence  and fear. They are trying to shake the  will of our country and our friends, but  the United States  of America will  never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the  Iraqi people will live in freedom.  Month by month, Iraqis are assuming  more responsibility for their own security and their own future. And tonight  we are honored  to welcome one of  Iraq’s most respected leaders, the current president of the Iraqi Governing  Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America  stands with you and the Iraqi people as  you build a free and peaceful nation.  Because of American leadership and  resolve, the world is changing for the  better. Last month, the leader of Libya  voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime’s weapons of  mass destruction programs, including a  uranium enrichment project  for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be  better off, and far more secure, without  weapons of mass murder. Nine months  of intense negotiations involving the  United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. And one  reason is clear: for diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and no  one can now doubt the word of America.  Different  threats  require  different  strategies. Along with nations in the  region, we are  insisting  that North  Korea eliminate its nuclear program.  America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its  commitments and not develop nuclear  weapons. America  is  committed  to  keeping  the world’s most dangerous  weapons out of the hands of the world’s  most dangerous regimes.  When I came to this rostrum on September 20, 2001, I brought the police  shield of a fallen officer, my reminder  of lives that ended and a task that does  not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our  enemies. And this pledge, given by one,  has been kept by many. You in the  Congress have provided the resources  for our defense and cast the difficult  votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering. America’s  intelligence personnel and diplomats  have been skilled and tireless.

6,41,2004-01-20,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Massachusetts.  ,2004
7,41,2004-01-20,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I ask  to be notified when 41⁄2minutes are up.  I am entitled to 5 minutes.  This bill shows the widening gulf between this administration’s words and  its deeds.  No doubt tonight, the President will  talk about healthy families. But this  bill weakens our clean air laws. And it  postpones steps we need right now to  protect our food supply from mad cow  disease.  The President will talk about education. But this bill fails the test when  it comes to funding for schools. And it  diverts scarce public education dollars  to private schools.  The President will talk about the  safety of our communities. But this  bill weakens our gun laws.  The President will talk about fairness. But there is nothing fair about  giving away good jobs of dedicated government workers to the cheapest bidder  that may even  send  those  jobs  abroad.  So it is a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde Presidency, where what you see is not what  you get.  But the greatest outrage in this bill  is that it denies the right to overtime  pay to 8 million hard-working Americans.  We may be fighting a war in Iraq, but  this President and this administration  are also waging a war on workers here  at home.  Majorities in both the Senate and the  House agreed that the Bush administration was wrong to deny overtime  protections to workers. By a vote in  the U.S. Senate of 54 to 45 and the U.S.  House of Representatives of 221 to 203,  we said to the President,  ‘‘You are  wrong.’’ But here it is, in this bill.  I know who I am fighting for.  I am fighting for the nurse who burns  the midnight oil day in and day out  caring for our sick and elderly with no  extra pay.  I am fighting for the firefighter and  first responder, the heroes of homeland  security, standing watch and working  nights and weekends to protect our liberty. They are our generations Paul  Reveres—prepared to act when called  to arms. They deserve fair compensation.  I am fighting for our veterans and  our men and women serving so bravely  now in Iraq and across the world, who  return to civilian life only to find that  the training they earned in the military is cruelly used to deny them their  right to overtime pay. Under current regulations, workers  can be denied overtime protection if  they fall within the category of what  they call professional employees, workers with a 4-year degree in a professional  field. It  is changed this year  under the Bush administration. The  plan would do away with the standard  and allow equivalent training in the  Armed Forces. You go and serve in Iraq  and get the training to serve in Iraq,  and come back here and you are ineligible, under these regulations, for overtime pay.  I ask unanimous consent that the  relevant  statute  be  printed  in  the  RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  SUBPARTD, PROFESSIONALEMPLOYEES,  §§541.300–.304  The current regulations pertaining to the  professional exemption contain four separate  categories of exempt employees: learned professionals, artistic professionals,  teachers,  and computer professionals. As with the executive and administrative exemptions, the  regulations contain both ‘‘short’’ and ‘‘long’’  duties tests, depending upon the salary level  of the employee. The long test contains a  separate primary duty requirement for each  of the four categories of employees. The long  test for learned professionals requires that  the primary duty consist of work requiring  knowledge of an advanced type in a field of  science or learning customarily acquired by  a prolonged course of specialized intellectual  instruction and study, as distinguished from  a general academic education and from an  apprenticeship, and from training in the performance of  routine mental, manual, or  physical  processes.  For  creative  professionals, the primary duty must consist of  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:32 Jan 21, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20JA6.008 S20PT1 ",2004
8,55,2004-01-20,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about a specific provision in the  Omnibus Appropriations bill. The bill  before  the Senate  includes a  2-year  delay in the implementation of country  of origin labeling for all products except fish. I am highly frustrated with  this delay because the conference committee went beyond the scope of its  conference. The House bill only had a  1-year  delay  for  implementation  of  country of origin labeling for meat and  meat products. The Senate bill  included an amendment  indicating the  strong support that country of origin  labeling had in the Senate. The discovery  of  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy, BSE, within our borders this holiday season was a wake-up  call to the urgency of country of origin  labeling implementation and the detriments of further delays.  After the announcement of a  ‘‘presumptive positive’’ BSE cow  in  the  U.S. domestic herd, the national and  international response was immediate.  Domestic markets  plunged  and  our  international  trading  partners  slammed their doors shut to our meat  products. Exports account for almost  10 percent of total U.S. beef production. Our largest export markets are  refusing our product and bloating the  domestic market. We’ve already lost a  majority of our export market, a void  that other beef exporting countries are  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:32 Jan 21, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G20JA6.036 S20PT1 ",2004

My wife and I had the privilege of  going with Bill and his wife to Romania. We traveled with them to other  countries throughout Europe talking  about NATO and other issues. In that  process, we became well acquainted  with two of America’s  finest public  servants. But on that occasion, they  became two of our best friends.

Lois tells the story about Bill the  night before we left saying his prayers  and concluding with  ‘‘Good-bye God,  we are moving to Washington.’’ And,  we had to pull John Jr. from under the  house.

Bill is 37, and Beth is married to Jeff  Shepherdson and has three children— Anna Kate, 6, Campbell, 4, and C.J., 2  years old, and Julie, our youngest is  now 28, works in New Orleans, and is  here with us today.  I’ll always remember that trip. My  mother, who is deceased, and my father, followed us to D.C. We got there  at night.  I had never  even visited  Washington, so we drove right to the  Capitol, and that evening the Marine  Corps band was in concert on the Capitol  steps.  It was  beautiful,  and  I  thought they were playing just for us.  It’s been a great 35 years—a few years  as a staff person, 14 years as a Member  of the Congress, representing southwest Louisiana, and it will be 18 years  as a U.S. Senator, representing our  State of Louisiana. I had the privilege  of  serving with  five Governors and  seven Presidents.  I have said for a year now that I  would announce my decision whether  to seek another term as U.S. Senator  after the governor’s election this year.  I further said that I would make that  announcement between November  15  and December 15. The difficulty of that  decision  is  shown by  the  fact  that  today is December 15.  Lois and I have spent a lot of time  discussing this decision—not formally,  but, ‘‘what do you think?’’ type discussions. Although one time she actually  sat up in bed, drew a line down the  middle of a page, and listed the pros  and cons of running—not surprisingly,  they came out just about even.  We have received lots of advice—from  my staff, from family and supporters  here in Louisiana, and from around the  country. Some of the letters from total  strangers were so touching and heartfelt that we will forever treasure them.  My colleagues in the Congress, especially in the Senate, spoke to both Lois  and me frequently with their thoughts  and suggestions. Colleagues, actually  from both sides of the aisle, urged me  to run again, and for their encouragement and friendship I cannot begin to  say how much Lois and I appreciate  them. My  special  appreciation  also  goes to TOMDASCHLE, HARRYREIDand  MARYLANDRIEU.  The citizens of Louisiana have greatly honored my family and me by allowing me to serve these 30-plus years as  their Congressman and U.S. Senator. I  can honestly say I enjoyed every moment and appreciated the opportunity  that I have had to serve.  But there comes a time in every career when it is time to step aside, and  let others step up and serve. And for  my family and me that time has arrived. I will not seek re-election to the  U.S. Senate.  Throughout my years in Congress I  have been guided by a simple philosophy to make government work for everyone. I did not go to Washington to  get nothing done other  than argue  about whose  fault  it was when we  failed to make government work.  My sincere hope is that future Congresses will be able  to pursue  the  center- out coalitions that I have advocated. It is my hope that cooperation  and  legitimate  compromise  between  our political parties will not be seen as  political failure, but rather as a means  of building a stronger democracy that  better serves our Nation.  To my wife Lois, we started this  journey together many years ago and  you have been there every step of the  way—through  the  good  times,  and  there were many, and through the not  so good times, and there a were a few.  I could not have asked for a more helpful and supportive partner and friend.  No one has been more lucky and fortunate than me in finding you.  To my staff here in Louisiana and in  Washington,  let me say I could not  have accomplished anything without  you. Our office has the greatest of reputations and all of you are truly part  of our family—and will always be.  To my father Ezra and to Lois’ mom,  Doris, I say thank you for putting up  with all the things we dragged you  through, whether you wanted to be  there or not. And to our children, John,  Bill, Beth and Jeff, and Julia, I say  thank you for being there—you have  made us very proud every step of the  way.  I am not leaving today. There is still  a lot to get done this Congress. We  have to get the energy bill passed, and  I want to get started on legislation for  the 40 million Americans who have no  health insurance. I look forward to cochairing with Governor-elect Kathleen  Blanco  the  very  important  summit  meeting on healthcare in Louisiana.  So this is not goodbye. After working  more than half my life on issues important to Louisiana, I intend to continue  that involvement in the future, but in  a  different  capacity. But  for  now,  thank you for the privilege and honor  of serving Louisiana and our country.∑ f  HONORING MARCIA COGGS  ∑",2004
12,69,2004-01-20,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, today  I want to remember Marcia Coggs, a  trailblazer in Wisconsin politics and a  dear friend, who passed away in December.  Words cannot fully express the impact Marcia Coggs had on the lives of  the people of Wisconsin. She was the  first African-American woman elected  to the State’s legislature and was widely known as  ‘‘the Conscience of the  State of Wisconsin.’’ Marcia also became the first African-American to sit  on the State legislature’s joint finance  committee. Better housing, the best in  public  education,  integration  and  human rights were just some of the  causes Marcia championed during her  16 years in the Wisconsin Legislature.  First elected to the State assembly  from Milwaukee in 1976, she forced the  State to listen and pay attention to  the troubling issues people in her district often faced. Civil rights, both in  Wisconsin and throughout the world,  were always at the  forefront of her  mind. Those who knew her were not  surprised when she protested against  apartheid in South Africa, even joining  a demonstration outside that nation’s  Washington, DC, embassy in 1985.  I had  the honor and privilege of  working with Marcia on several issues,  including a successful effort to make  Martin Luther King Jr. Day a legal  holiday in Wisconsin. We also joined  together in fighting to establish a private cause of action for civil rights violations.  I am honored to have been associated  with her and proud to have called her  both a mentor and a  friend. Marcia  made an outstanding contribution to  the lives of countless Wisconsinites and  left a legacy that the people of my  State will honor  for many years to  come.∑ f  RETIREMENT OF PETTY OFFICER  FIRST  CLASS  FREDERICA  MONIQUE WILLIAMS  ∑",2004

Sally has been on my staff since 1997 and  has performed ably and consistently during  her time with me. As a public spokesperson  before the media and countless community organizations, I could have had no better assistant to help positively present my agenda on  behalf of all New Hampshire’s citizens.  Her distinguished record as a journalist and  Press Secretary  for Congressman Bill Zeliff  (NH – 01) before joining my staff demonstrated  her talent. On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second District, her work and success with media  outlets as diverse as  the Manchester Union  Leader and Concord Monitor; Milford Cabinet  and Keene Sentinel; WMUR and NH Public  Television; and WOKQ, WEVO, and WZID  have proven her skill.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to  Sally’s service to New Hampshire and the nation. I am extremely honored to consider her  and her husband Gary as  friends and wish  them the best of luck in their new lives far— but not far in spirit— from the Granite State. f  RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE  OF NIGHTRIDERS, INC.  HON. BOB BEAUPREZ  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 20, 2004 ",2004
29,104,2004-01-20,Mr. BEAUPREZ.," Mr. Speaker, the occasion  on which I rise today is to recognize the importance of one small business based in my  home state of Colorado. This business has  provided Colorado with an innovative private  sector concept that demonstrates social-minded entrepreneurship by assisting  in our nation’s fight against drunk driving.  Each year, seventeen thousand Americans  die in alcohol-related traffic accidents and over  six hundred thousand are injured. While Congress has made numerous efforts to reduce  the number of these tragedies, private sector  industries and community  leaders perform a  vital  role  to stop drinking and driving. One  such company  leading  the  fight against  this  tragic and avoidable threat is NightRiders, Inc.  Located  in Boulder, Colorado, NightRiders  was created by three pioneering young men  who wanted to reduce impaired driving and its  tragic consequences. Founders Gary Calnan,  Brad Dickerhofe, and Carl Grodnik  implemented NightRiders  to operate on a simple,  but effective business plan that gives individuals peace of mind and  the  freedom  to get  home safely without risking lives. NightRiders  provides such a valuable service that it enjoys  the endorsements of local businesses and law  enforcement officials.  Let me take a moment to explain how they  operate. A dispatched driver on a folding motorized scooter meets you at your automobile,  places  the scooter  in  the  trunk, drives you  home, and the driver gets back on the scooter  to assist the next customer.  Recently, NightRiders was  recognized by  the National Commission Against Drunk Driving  (NCADD) and  received  the 2003 Corporate Leadership Award. Past recipients of  the Corporate Leadership Award  from  the  NCADD include Liberty Mutual Group (2002),  The Century Council (2001), Kmart Corporation (2000) and Daimler Chrysler (1999). By  presenting  this  award  to NightRiders,  the  NCAAD  is  recognizing  the potential  for  the  NightRiders solution to affect real change in  the problem of drinking and driving on a national scale.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me  and  the  NCAAD  in  commending  NightRiders for their efforts and vision to reduce the senseless tragedies associated with  drunk driving. f  IN RECOGNITION OF MS.

30,104,2004-01-20,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor an exemplary  individual, Gloria Nilson  whose  professional  accomplishments  are  equally matched by her generous and selfless  contributions to the community in the areas of  education, the arts and culture. Just this past  year, on December 6, 2003,  the Monmouth  University Library Association honored Ms.  Nilson, awarding her with their 2003 Community and Humanities Award.  It is clear to me that Ms. Nilson is truly deserving of this award because of her dedication and diligence with every project that she  has taken on. Being regarded as a pioneer in  a field where few women were even licensed  to sell real estate, Ms. Nilson is widely recognized in the state of New Jersey, and nationally as one of the state’s top-ranking Realtors.  Remarkably, Ms. Nilson began her career  carrying a typewriter in the trunk of her car to  draw up contracts and close sales for clients.  After being ranked Number 1 in the state of  New Jersey for residential real estate volume  by the New Jersey Real Estate Board for four  consecutive years, she started Gloria Nilson  Realtors in 1977. As Executive Vice President,  Director of Luxury Homes  for Gloria Nilson  Realtors/GMAC Real Estate, she is the exclusive affiliate for Sotheby’s International Realty  for the Greater Monmouth County area, and in  2000, placed third in the country for GMAC.  Notable among her numerous affiliations  and philanthropic activities; Ms. Nilson is the  founding  board member  of  the Women’s  Council for the Cancer Center at Monmouth  Medical Center, she is also the first woman to  be named chairperson of the Business Council  at Monmouth University’s School of Business.  Widely  recognized  for her outstanding contributions both professionally and personally,  her awards include the Monmouth Girl Scouts  Council 2001 Women of Distinction Award, the  Monmouth  Ocean  Development  Council’s  1996 Silver Gull Award for Business Achievement, and the 2000 Community Service Award  for GMAC Real Estate, which is now given annually in the name of Gloria Nilson.  Once again, Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  congratulate Ms. Gloria Nilson on her Community and Humanities Award and offer her the  highest praise  for her professional achievements, as well as her civic contributions. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

32,104,2004-01-20,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize Cloverdale Police  Chief Robert Parks Dailey, who is retiring after  34 years of service to his community.  Chief Dailey has spent all of his adult life in  lain enforcement. He began his career as a  Senior Patrol Officer with the Berkeley, California Police Department  in 1970 and spent  nine years on the force during one of the most  tumultuous periods  in  this city’s colorful history.  He joined the Cloverdale Police Department  as a Sergeant in 1979 and quickly advanced  through the ranks. He was promoted to Lieutenant, a rank he held until 1987, when he became the Chief of Police. In 1993, his title was  changed to Director of Public Safety when the  Cloverdale Fire Department was added to his  command. When the Fire Department hired a  full time Chief in 1996, he reacquired the rank  of Chief of Police, a position he held until December 31, 2003.  During his tenure with the Cloverdale Police  Department, he automated the police records  system, restructured the Department for clearer lines of authority and responsibility, implemented a remodeling of the Department, and  oversaw the Department’s participation in the  county-wide  Computer  Aided  Dispatch/ Records Management System/Mobile Data  Computer Program.

Will Rorvig,  from my  home state of Colorado, recently passed away  after  courageously battling a  series of  illnesses. Will was known throughout the Denver community for his zest for life, friendly disposition and generous spirit. I am honored to  rise today to recognize Will’s many contributions to the state of Colorado and our great  nation.  Will was raised in Montana and graduated  from the University of Montana in 1967. Following graduation, Will answered his country’s  call  to duty, and served honorably  in  the  United States Army during the Vietnam War.  He married his lovely wife Lana in 1977.  Will spent his professional career in the field  of accounting. Renowned for his brilliance in  tax law, Will was widely respected as an outstanding accountant. Over the past six years,  Will held the position of Tax Director for the  Anschutz Corporation;  there he was known  not only for his intelligence, but also for his  leadership and willingness to mentor less experienced members of his staff.  Will was a beloved figure in Colorado. He  delighted in playing golf and meeting for meals  with his many friends, business acquaintances  and family members throughout Denver. Will  is also  remembered  for his generosity. Not  only did Will perform traditional acts of charity,  but he also had a unique penchant for generously assisting anyone he encountered whom  he perceived needed his help. Will’s altruistic  nature certainly worked  to  the betterment of  countless individuals less fortunate than himself.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise and pay  tribute  to Will Rorvig. Will was a generous  man, a loyal employee, and a dedicated mentor. Above all, Will was a loving husband to  his wonderful wife and a tremendous friend to  many. There is no question that the state of  Colorado and our nation are better off as the  result of Will’s contributions. My heart goes  out  to Will’s  loved ones during  this difficult  time of bereavement. f  FREEDOM FOR EDUARDO DI´AZ  FLEITAS!  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 20, 2004 Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to speak about Eduardo  Dı´az Fleitas, a prisoner of conscience in totalitarian Cuba.  Eduardo Dı´az Fleitas is a farmer by trade  who became a dissident by necessity. The incessant brutal repression of human rights by  the  tyrant Fidel Castro  forced Mr. Dı´az  to  choose between a life without rights or fighting  for a life with freedom.  Mr. Dı´az bravely chose to dedicate his life to  the  fight  for  freedom. He  joined his  fellow  Cuban dissidents and eventually Mr. Dı´az rose  to become vice president of  the 5 August  Movement, an organization  commemorating  the popular uprising against the dictatorship by  the people of Havana on August 5, 1994.  With predictable cruelty,  the  tyrant, Fidel  Castro, unleashed his machinery of repression  on Mr. Dı´az. According  to Amnesty  International, Mr. Dı´az was subjected  to  regular  harassment, including periods of detention that  culminated  in one year’s  restricted  freedom  and house surveillance for public disorder on  February 25, 2000.  Undeterred by threats of continued harassment, Mr. Dı´az resumed his role as a staunch  advocate for freedom for every Cuban citizen.  In  the  tyrant Castro’s horrific March 2003,  crackdown on dissidents, Mr. Dı´az was arrested once again. According to the sham trial  verdict that sentenced Mr. Dı´az to 21 years in  Castro’s gulag, Mr. Dı´az was convicted because: It is known by everyone in the area that he  directs  an  opposition  group  of  so-called  ‘human rights,’ carrying out activities and  meetings, using our national flag and showing posters asking for freedom for political  prisoners and prisoners of conscience, in a  frank challenge to the judicial, political, and  social system. Mr. Dı´az was sentenced to 21 years in the  hell hole of Castro’s gulag because he challenged  the bankrupt, backward,  repressive  system that robs its citizens of every freedom.  Mr. Speaker,  today  this Congress participates in one of the great traditions of our Republic. This evening, President Bush will deliver the State of the Union speech to a joint  session of Congress here in this very chamber. As we gather here to participate in our  constitutional responsibility let us also rise as  one to display our solidarity with those brave  souls who struggle for the same freedoms 90  miles from our shore. Let us demand the immediate release of Eduardo Dı´az Fleitas and  all prisoners of conscience in totalitarian Cuba. f  TRIBUTE TO NIGHTRIDERS INC.  HON.

34,111,2004-01-20,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored to  rise before you to recognize a remarkable organization  from  the  State  of  Colorado.  NightRiders Incorporated of Boulder, Colorado  was recently recognized for its innovative approach to protecting Coloradans from the perils of drunk driving with the National Commission Against Drunk Driving ’s Corporate Leadership Award. I am proud to call the attention  of my colleagues and this nation to the contributions  that NightRiders  is making  for  the  betterment of the Boulder community.  NightRiders has developed a unique way of  getting Boulder citizens home from a night out.  Upon request, a NightRiders employee rides a  collapsible motorized scooter  to  the patrons’  vehicle, places  the scooter  in  the car, and  safely transports the customer and their vehicle home. This service provides the passenger  a safe ride while ensuring that our streets are  safer for all.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to  NightRiders Incorporated for its commitment to  improving the safety of Colorado’s roadways.  NightRiders is dedicated to the prevention of  drunk driving and  the  company’s achievements are certainly worthy of  recognition.  I  would like to congratulate NightRiders on this  well-deserved award. f  IN HONOR OF HAROLD REDDICK  HON. JIM DAVIS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 20, 2004 ",2004
35,111,2004-01-20,Mr. JIM DAVIS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in honor of Harold Reddick, a pioneer in  Tampa Bay’s  civil  rights  community, who  leaves behind a legacy of fighting for a better  life for all Floridians.  Following in the footsteps of his father, Harold started his career as a porter for Pullman  Co., and went on to serve the Tampa chapter  of  the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  But Harold was born  to  lead—he was constantly breaking boundaries  in his battle  for  equal rights.  In the early 1940 ’s, traveling all the way to  Chicago to plan a march on Washington, Harold fought to open federal government and defense jobs to black workers. Harold shook up  Tampa Bay’s establishment by attempting toregister in the local White Municipal Primary,  and he was arrested for trying to patronize an  all-white drive-in theater.  A former vice president of the Tampa area  chapter of the NAACP and strong supporter of  the Montgomery  Improvement Association,  which helped to organize the Montgomery bus  boycott, Harold was not afraid to challenge the  old rules. He never let intimidation or violence  get in his way.  After  leaving  the  railroad  industry, Harold  went on to fight for the poor and unemployed.  Working for the AFL–CIO’s Human Resources  Development Institute, Harold helped the less  fortunate get back on their feet.  As vice president of the local branch of the  A. Philip Randolph  Institute,  the senior constituency group of  the AFL–CIO, and as a  member of the Florida Silver-Haired Legislature, Harold was an advocate for seniors. And  Harold fought for the young as well, serving  on  various  advisory  committees  to  the  Hillsborough County School Board, alongside  his wife, Doris, a school board member.  Like so many public officials in our community, I had the good fortune to call Harold my  friend.  I could always count on him  for his  candid and constructive counsel. Until his last  breath, Harold never stopped helping everyone he knew be the best that they could be  and helping our community be  the best  it  could be.  Harold Reddick  fought  for all of us, and  thanks to him, our community is stronger. On  behalf of the Tampa Bay area, I would like to  extend my deepest sympathy to Harold’s family and friends. Harold’s legacy will not soon  be forgotten. VerDate jul 14 2003  05:14 Jan 21, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20JA8.007 E20PT1 ",2004

55,26,2004-02-02,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. President, I  rise to propose that we turn the Presidential nominating process over to the  National Football League, except for  Super Bowl  half-time  shows. Then  maybe we can have a second Super  Bowl, where anything is possible and  everyone can participate.  Take the example of our colleague  Senator KERRY’s team—I am sure the  Senator from Vermont will be quick to  point out it is the team of many Senators from New England—the New England Patriots. Last night, they became  the Super Bowl champions.  On September 12, in the season’s first  game, the Buffalo Bills trounced the  Patriots 31 to 0. If this had been the  first-in-the-Nation Presidential nominating caucus, the Patriots would have  been toast. You know the pundits’ rule:  Only three tickets out of Iowa. The Patriots certainly didn’t look like one of  the  three best professional  football  teams. Then, the Washington Redskins  defeated the Patriots, as unlikely as it  would have been for DENNISKUCINICH  to upend Senator KERRYin New Hampshire. But  in the National Football  League, upsets don’t end the season.  The Patriots played 14 more games.  They won them all. Yesterday, they  beat  the Carolina Panthers  in  the  Super Bowl for their 15th consecutive  win.

56,33,2004-02-02,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I speak  in memory of the Honorable Sebastian  Garafolo, who passed away on Wednesday, January 21, 2004 at 72 years of age.  Seb, as he was known, served the people of Middletown, CT for over 31 years,  including four terms as one of its most  popular mayors. This was no  small  feat. Seb Garafalo was a Republican  who was the mayor of a city with three  Democrats for every Republican. But  his hard work and his kind spirit won  him supporters and  friends on both  sides of the aisle. Seb Garafalo was a  friend and a gentleman first, and a politician second.  From an early age, Seb Garafolo was  an individual who wanted to make a  difference. As soon as he graduated  high school in 1951, he enlisted in the  Connecticut National Guard. During  the Korean War, he was called up to active duty and was stationed in Germany. He reached the rank of SSG before being honorably discharged. For  many years  to  come, Seb Garafolo  would be intimately involved in veterans’ causes in Middletown, including  the founding of the Middletown Military Museum, Inc. just this past year.  Until the day he died, Seb Garafolo  never forgot his military service and  those with whom he served.  After years of participating in community organizations, from the Elks  Lodge and the American Legion to the  St. Sebastian Church and  the Holy  Name Society, Seb Garafolo began his  formal public  service when he was  elected  to  the Middletown Common  Council in 1973. In 1983, he was elected  to his first term as mayor. He would  hold that post until 1989, and then  again from 1991 to 1993. Seb helped renovate Middletown’s schools, roads, and  parks, and took the lead on building a  trash-to-energy plant. He even put his  own life on the line when he wore a  wire for the Middletown Police Department while meeting with individuals  suspected of organized crime.  After his final term as mayor, Seb  spent 6 years as Middletown’s tax collector,  and  then was  elected,  once  again, to the Common Council. In 2001,  he closed out a long and accomplished  career by serving as assistant district  director for my friend and colleague  Congressman ROBSIMMONS.  Seb’s commitment to service was obviously extraordinary. And that kind  of commitment extended to his private  life as well. Seb was married to his  high  school  sweetheart, Marie,  and  they had two sons, Michael and Joseph.  When Seb was diagnosed with the disease that eventually would take his  life, he was given six months to live.  But he was determined to be there with  Marie to celebrate their 50th wedding  anniversary. So  for  21⁄2 years, Seb  Garafolo  fought  cancer  with  that  dream in mind. And just a few months  before his passing, he and Marie did  have that golden anniversary celebration.  On behalf of the United States Senate, I offer my thanks to Seb Garafolo  for his years of service to the people of  Middletown. And  I  offer my most  heartfelt  sympathies  to Marie, Michael, Joseph, Seb’s sister Josephine,  his grandchildren and great grandchild,  and to everyone who knew and loved  him.∑  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:41 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S02FE4.REC S02FE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
57,40,2004-02-02,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I have  sought recognition to introduce legislation, along with Senator SANTORUM,  to  honor  former President Ronald  Reagan by naming the Federal Building and Courthouse in Harrisburg, PA,  in his name.  President Ronald Reagan was a watershed force in 20th Century history.  He was a master diplomat and statesman,  largely responsible  for winning  the Cold War. His summits with former  Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev were  tours  de  force  of  negotiation  and  stagecraft. He was called  ‘‘the great  communicator’’  for good  reason. He  conveyed his message with power and  precision, often convincing even his  staunchest opponents to see things his  way. His talents and his touch helped  rally a Democrat-controlled Congress  to support much of his legislative agenda,  including  bold  fiscal  reforms—  defying conventional wisdom that predicted more partisan stalemate. He ran  for President on the slogan ‘‘Morning  in America’’—and delivered.  President Reagan  also  took  bold  steps on the social front. By transferring power  from Washington to the  States and cities, he showed that local  governments can be laboratories for a  wide  range  of  public-policy  experiments—with  greater  flexibility  and  sensitivity. The approach was in line  with his general push from big government toward individual liberty.  To some, Ronald Reagan’s greatest  legacy was strengthening our national  defense. The Berlin Wall toppled,  it  seemed, directly  from his call,  ‘‘Mr.  Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall!’’ The  invasion of Grenada rescued American  students and resulted in the overthrow  of a Marxist government. His vision for  a national missile defense system  is  leading to greater security for all of us.  President Reagan  showed  courage  and charisma, even in crisis. As he was  about to undergo surgery to remove a  bullet that lay an inch from his heart,  he told his wife, ‘‘Honey, I forgot to  duck.’’ The next morning, the President met with aides  in his hospital  room and signed a bill into law.  For these reasons and many more, I  urge my colleagues to join us in bestowing  this honor upon  American.  this great  better  By Mrs. BOXER:  S. 2045.

",2004
58,40,2004-02-02,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, today I  am  introducing  the  Secure  and  Verifiable Electronic Voting Act of  2004.  The  2000  presidential  election  exposed a number of serious problems  with the accuracy and fairness of election procedures in this country, as well  as the reliability of certain types of  voting technology. As a result of these  irregularities, many  eligible  voters  were  effectively disenfranchised and  thus deprived of one of their most fundamental rights. This is not acceptable  in a democracy such as ours.  Our  constituents  demanded  and we responded.  In  2002, Congress passed  the Help  America Vote Act (HAVA). This important legislation sets Federal minimum  standards for voting systems, including  requiring that the equipment used is  reliable, accurate, and accessible to all.  It encourages the use of direct recording electronic voting systems to replace  the outdated punch card and  lever machines. It also requires that  voting systems provide voters the opportunity to correct errors and that  they produce a permanent record with  a manual audit capacity.  However, HAVA  does  not  go  far  enough. As we move our voting systems into the 21st century, we need to  ensure the greatest level of accountability possible. Voters need to have  confidence  in  the  technology  that  they’re using, and they need to be assured that their votes will be counted  exactly as they are cast. It is imperative that any voting system certified  by the Federal Government provides  these assurances.  In my home State of California, we  are already using touch-screen voting  machines in some areas—28 percent of  the precincts by the March primary.  But, these machines currently do not  leave any paper trail and cannot be  verified  for  complete  accuracy. We  need an electronic voting system that  is modern, secure, and verifiable. The  State of California  is  taking  these  steps. Secretary of State Kevin Shelley  has required the use of voter-verified  paper audit trails and safety measures,  such as manufacturer security,  local  testing of machines, and random audits  of  system  software. These practices  need to be in place nationwide.  My bill, the Secure and Verifiable  Electronic Voting Act—the SAVE Voting Act would require that a voter-  verified paper trail for each vote cast  be in place for the November 2004 elections. What that means is this: after an  individual votes, he or she will have  the opportunity to review the vote on a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:41 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S02FE4.REC S02FE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

60,5,2004-02-06,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I thank  my colleague, Senator DASCHLE. I say  to Senator FRIST, blood pressures rise  from time to time actually on the floor  of the Senate, depending on what we  are doing. Mine relates to the issue of  when we treat serious things too lightly or light things too seriously.  Speaking of that, most of us agree  that a serious matter that ought to be  treated seriously is the highway bill.  This week was a disappointment because we had the difficulty of getting  into our office buildings and the ricin  issue here on Capitol Hill.  I know both the Republican leader  and the Democratic leader share this  view. This highway bill  is critically  important.  I recall a political campaign in an  election that was waged a couple of  campaigns ago where they had a sign  on the wall that said, ‘‘It is the economy, stupid.’’ That was their sign, just  to remind them every day to focus like  a laser on the economy.  With respect to this country’s economy and jobs, at a time when more  than 21⁄2million people lost their jobs  in recent years and 8 to 10 million people are now  looking  for a  job this  morning, there isn’t anything that we  can do that is, in my judgment, more  urgent than passing this highway bill.  Why? Because this is a job generator.  Instantly, people go back to work.  It means that contractors are out  there with new contracts. They are hiring people. Everyone in this Chamber  knows that the one formula for producing  jobs now,  immediately,  is to  pass this highway bill.  It has been a disappointment to me  this week that we have had some—it  was described in the National Journal  or Congressional Quarterly as a small  group of Republicans—who have decided to hold this bill up and stop it.  That would not be in this country’s interest. We must get this done. I appreciate  the strength of the majority leader and  the strength of the Democratic leader,  as well, to stay with it. I would say to  Senator FRISTthat I believe there is a  broad,  bipartisan  consensus  in  this  Chamber  to produce a highway bill  that helps us invest in the improvements necessary in roads and bridges  across the country. Over 30 percent of  them are in disrepair. But more important than that, in my judgment, is the  ability to be a job generator, to expand  this economy and put people back to  work is job one.  There is not much more of importance we can do this year. I don’t know  of a more important bill this year that  will be related to American jobs than  this bill. So it is my hope that, even  though there is some obstruction going  on by a few in the Chamber on the  other side, we stay here, stick with it,  work late if necessary, and get this bill  done.  It  is  that  important  for  this  country. Frankly, I think there is a  broad, bipartisan consensus on  that  point. When we have that, let’s stick  with it and do it, even if there are some  in this Chamber who have decided they  want to hold it up.  I thank my colleague from South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE, for giving me  the time. I am about to go chair a  hearing. It also relates to jobs. This  jobs issue is so critically important.  People got out of bed this morning in  this country asking themselves: Where  can I find a job? There are millions and  millions of them. It is a big deal, a big  issue. It is a serious matter for this  country.  The bill we are considering now has  the opportunity to allow us to address  this in a very significant way, and we  cannot and should not miss this opportunity.  I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.  f  JOB CREATION  ",2004
61,5,2004-02-06,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Senator from North Dakota  for his comments this morning. I share  his view about the importance of this  highway bill, in particular.  I wish to say a few things about both  the highway bill as well as the budget  this morning. We just received our report again this month about the economy and the jobs created. I think the  good news is that we did see the creation of 112,000 new jobs in January. I  think that is a positive development.  The bad news is that it falls short of  what was needed to keep us on a path  to ensure that jobs are not lost during  the President’s first term.  Mr. President, 150,000 new  jobs  in  January was the stated goal of the Administration. The figure released today  indicates a substantial shortfall; this is  nearly 40,000 jobs short of their stated  goal. Of  course,  it  is  dramatically  short—two-thirds  short—of what  the  goal would be to reverse this unemployment debacle we have witnessed  for the last 3 years. 300,000 new private  sector jobs would have to be created  each month to erase the decline we  have witnessed the past 36 months. So  while we made  some  progress  this  month with 112,000 new jobs, we are  falling  far short of the Administration’s stated goal of 150,000 and even  further short of the 300,000 jobs necessary  to  reverse  the  unfortunate  trend.  There is another disturbing problem  that we have not been able to address,  and the administration has not been  able to address. This is the 42nd month  in a row that we have actually seen a  loss  of manufacturing  jobs. For  42  straight months manufacturing  jobs  have declined.  The  jobs  issue may be the single  most critical issue as we look at the  economy. There is a long, long way to  go before we can say with any confidence that we have turned this economy around, that people who have jobs  will keep them, and people who don’t  have jobs will get them.  I think most of us would receive today’s news about jobs this month with  that sense of disappointment, but also  with the realization that 112,000 jobs is  better than what we had in December  when only a thousand jobs were added.  THETRANSPORTATIONBILL  SARBANES,  Let me take a moment to talk about  the  transportation  bill  again  this  morning. I will not repeat my concerns  about the delay and resulting loss of  those jobs. I want to focus on the positive and, once again, compliment the  managers of the bill who balanced divergent interests to bring us a finely  crafted bill that certainly deserves our  support. Chairman INHOFEand Senator  JEFFORDS, Senator BOND and Senator  REIDdeserve our praise for working in  a bipartisan  fashion, as do Banking  Committee Chairman SHELBYand Senator  and Finance  Committee Chairman GRASSLEY and Senator BAUCUS. But  I also  especially  thank the majority leader for scheduling the time it will take to get this  bill done. When the leader and I met on  Monday, I was impressed with his resolve and desire to bear down and get  this critical work done for this country.  Our roads, our bridges, our transit  system, our rail lines, and our ports all  need assistance to ensure that our Nation has the first-class infrastructure  needed to reinvigorate our economy  and make our country strong and competitive. After having  lost 3 million  jobs over the  last 3 years, there  is  nothing more important than passing  this bill, which will provide hundreds  of thousands of jobs.

65,12,2004-02-06,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, it  feels as if we have been away a long  time. This was an unpleasant respite  and it goes to the issue of how safe our  country can be. This, the people’s property, is not exempt from terror or the  threat of terror. It does not matter  whether we define terrorists as someone coming from Afghanistan or the  Middle East or some  faraway place.  Terrorism is not different if it comes  from an individual or a dissatisfied or  disgruntled American. We have to fight  against  it with  everything  in  our  means. Unfortunately, we see the result of this fight within our society,  within the Capitol. It is not the glorious place it used to be from the outside. We still have the responsibility,  for the glory of our country, to carry  on from the inside.  To our majority leader, we extend  our feelings that it could not have been  an uglier manifestation of differences.  He is someone who we all know has had  experiences. I am sure he finds challenges on his trips to Africa and doing  the work he has done in flying a singleengine plane to go places to perform  services for those less fortunate.  I thank the majority leader for bringing up this bill. I know there have been  concerns or maybe even disputes from  other parts of Government not to move  ahead with this, to try and reduce it to  less worthiness. While I have the floor  and there is apparently no rush for others to follow, I want to say that for my  staff, from the Lautenberg office, and I  think it is probably fair to say those on  the staff of the entire Capitol who perform as they always do under pressure,  they manage to get their work done.  They are willing to be inconvenienced.  They are willing to do whatever they  have to do to perform their tasks, and  we greatly respect it.  That is why I get upset when I hear  talk about reducing Government until  it withers on the vine when we have  people here who work so hard and diligently to keep things going on behalf  of our society and across this country.  I am pleased we are finally taking up  S. 1072, the bill that reauthorizes our  Nation’s Federal  Surface Transportation Program. I do not think there is  any other bill we are going to pass this  year that is as important or more important, let’s say, than the highway  bill. We have to be able to move people  and  goods  efficiently,  economically,  and  safely. Otherwise, our economy  would choke.  It is a peculiar anomaly that even as  things have slowed down in this period  of recession, I did not see any less traffic on our roads, or any less pollution  coming from congestion. So it is important we get on with this, and I hope  we are not going to get any resistance  to what appears to be a bill that takes  care of needs across this country.  I hope the President is not approaching this with an objection  in mind.  Whether that objection extends as far  as a veto or not, we do not know, but  I hope he will see this is an essential  part of our functioning as a society and  encourages us to make these investments which are talked about so glibly.  As the saying goes, when it comes to  where the rubber meets the road, we do  not see  it happening. We hope  it  is  going to happen now, and the bill will  pass—and I think it is inevitable we  will pass this bill—that it moves along  at least at a pace that it leaves us with  the amounts of funding we are looking  at.  S. 1072 is a complex bill. The major  titles come from four different authorizing committees. There are  lots of  Members who deserve credit for bringing it to the floor. I think of Senator  INHOFEand Senator JEFFORDSand Senator BOND and Senator HARRYREID  who had the primary responsibility for  this measure in the Environment and  Public Works Committee. Also, Senator SHELBY and Senator SARBANES  worked so hard to craft a transit title  which falls under the jurisdiction of  the Banking Committee. This title is  particularly important to the residents  of my home State, New Jersey, over 11  percent of whom rely on public transportation to get to and from work.  Senator GRASSLEYand Senator BAUCUSand the rest of the Finance Committee had to figure out how to pay for  the bill.  Last but not least, the committee on  which  I  serve,  the Commerce Committee, reported out  its title, which  deals with many important safety programs, under the able  leadership of  Senator MCCAINand Senator HOLLINGS.  This past Monday, the groundhog,  Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow. It  suggests we face 6 more weeks of winter weather, the kind of dreary weather  we have  grown  accustomed  to—the  kind that we have seen in these last  several weeks and we did not like any  of it. We did not like it when it was  raining and we did not like it when it  was snowing. We like to see some rain  to make sure we have enough water,  but the accompanying misery was not  pleasant at all. I know I speak for everybody when I say that.  There was another shadow, however,  we saw on Monday last, the shadow  cast by record-breaking deficits in the  President’s budget request  for  fiscal  year 2005. Because of these budget deficits, the President is requesting, sadly,  inadequate funding for our highways,  mass transit, intercity and freight rail  transportation,  safety programs and  environmental  protection. When  it  comes  to  the  future of our  surface  transportation system, the President,  with his proposal, is forecasting 6 more  years of traffic congestion, air pollution, wasted fuel, unnecessary fatalities, and a stagnant economy.  The Department of Transportation  expects freight traffic to double in this  country over the next 2 decades. Meanwhile, more and more Americans will  need to use our roads, rails, and runways to travel to their jobs, to school,  to medical appointments, to worship,  to vacation. We are already straining  capacity as we follow those pursuits.  The needs of our transportation system are well documented and I am disappointed President Bush has declined  to acknowledge these needs in his vision of America’s future. S. 1072 would  authorize a program that is 25 percent  bigger than the Bush administration’s  current proposal. The House of Representatives may consider one that is  even 50 percent bigger than the Bush  administration’s proposal. We are on  the right track, and the President is on  the wrong track. I am hopeful we can  all agree on a  final proposal which  truly addresses the needs of our national transportation system this  is  something  the American people deserve.  A bigger, better highway bill is not  just about reducing traffic congestion  and repairing bridges, as important as  those  things are. The Secretary of  Transportation, Norman Mineta, has  stated that $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure supports 47,000  good-paying  jobs,  jobs which are  located in America. When it comes to  trade, we do not need to export any  more jobs. We have to curb that, and  we can do it by investing in transportation. One  billion  dollars  invested  equals  47,000  good-paying  jobs. We  ought to look at it from that aspect  very seriously.  Transportation needs vary across the  country.  I can assure you, when  it  comes to need, my State, New Jersey,  is near the top of the list. New Jersey  is home to some of the oldest transportation routes in the country. Roads,  bridges, rail tracks, and airports built  decades ago are in need of repair or replacement. Our portion of the national  transportation  system  includes  420  miles of interstate highway and 6,300  bridges, 1,580 miles of class 1 railroad  tracks. There are 49 public use airports  and the  largest seaport on the east  coast.  I point this out just to indicate the  needs of one State, and I know the  needs of other States are also acute.  This infrastructure makes a significant  contribution to our national economy.  Over 375 million tons of general cargo  move through the State, mostly on  trucks and railcars, to and from the  Port of New York and New Jersey.  Newark Liberty  International Airport is the eighth largest cargo airport  in the country. And, mind you, we are  only a very small State, about 47th in  size, and we have the eighth largest  cargo airport in the country, the 20th  biggest  in  the world, handling over  78,000 tons of cargo annually.

If people have amendments, they can ask to meet with our  staffs. We will go over the amendments  to see if they are acceptable. The offices are open now. There is no reason  not to be able to have the resources  they need to go over this bill with our  staffs.  The point I am making is we are open  for business and we want to make sure  everyone has the opportunity to talk  to our staffs about any problems they  have with the bill and ways it can be  made better.  Anyway, please work with our staffs.  They will be in their offices this weekend.  I hope when Monday morning  comes, people will also recognize the  offices will be open.

75,19,2004-02-06,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I will restate what you just heard. We will resume consideration of S. 1072, the highway bill on Monday. It has been a challenging week in lots of different ways.  We have had this incident in my personal office and a lot went on here on  the floor, with progress.  I know the ranking member and the  managers of this bill have been frustrated in that we have not made as  much progress as  they would have  liked. They would like to have this bill  signed, sealed, delivered, and done. We  did have good debate on the highway  bill. Important points have been made  throughout  the week. We have  the  foundation to complete action on this  bill next week. You just heard that we  will be working through the afternoon.  There will be people working tonight  and people will be working tomorrow,  as you have just heard, on Saturday  and Sunday, in preparation for coming  back in at 1 o’clock on Monday.  We have a lot to cover next week on  this bill. It is an important bill. I argue  that it is a vital bill to support the infrastructure we are all so dependent  upon each and every day in our activities, whether it is during the weekends,  or going to school or work, or as part  of our business. We have an obligation  to continue to address it and to complete this next week.  Since we are closing down for the  week, it has been only 5 days since this  letter with this toxic substance was directed at this institution. As I have  said before, I have been very pleased  with the response in terms of the coordination, the communication. It is  not perfect; it can be better; but I assure people we will take each incident  and do our very best to communicate  as well as we can, review procedures,  and review systems, and we are doing  just that.  I just finished a conference call for 30  minutes with  the  40 employee  staff  members affected most directly from  my office and from the EPW office and  Senators JEFFORDS’ and INHOFE’s office, answering questions. There are a  lot of unanswered questions. We will  answer those and meet with them and  come up with different and better procedures as we go forward.  The fact that the chairman could say  the Hart Building is open tomorrow is  music to my ears. We were able to open  it ahead of schedule. The Russell Building got opened and the Dirksen Building, which is still closed, will be opened  Monday morning. It is right on schedule.  I thank everybody  for coming together and working through a broad  range of both national agencies and  agencies here on the Hill. First and  foremost is the safety of our Senate  employees, and we responded in such a  way that I am happy to say nobody has  been hurt. Everybody is OK, in spite of  the fact we had this assault.  Also during this week, in Chairman  GREGG’s HELP Committee, we passed  S. 1879, an extension of the mammography quality provision. In Chairman  COLLINS’ committee, we worked on S.  1612, which established a technology  equipment  and  information  transfer  program  with  the  Department  of  Homeland Security. We passed  that  this week. The Senate confirmed a U.S.  district judge this week for the Northern District of Illinois. We will be back  in Monday. The chairman encourages  members to have amendments and contact him. His staff will be working  through the weekend.  As the assistant Democratic leader  mentioned, we will not be voting on  Monday, but we will be working. I will  consult with Senator INHOFE and the  Democratic  leadership as we go  forward. I hope we will be prepared for a  vote early Tuesday morning. We will  keep people posted in that regard.  I did mention this earlier. Do you  know what your blood pressure  is?  Fifty million  people  have  hypertension, which causes stroke and heart  attacks. A third of the people don’t  know they have it. If you know you  have it, we have ways to treat it these  days. The Medicare  bill we  passed  means you can diagnose it because, for  the  first,  in an entry  level physical  exam which is part of Medicare, you  are going to be able to have hypertension  treated.  If you don’t know  what your blood pressure is, go home  tonight and think about that and have  it checked.  ",2004

80,16,2004-02-23,Mr. ENZI.," Madam President, our Nation’s medical litigation system is broken and we need to start working to fix  it. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the Gregg-Ensign bill. It  is  time to stop filibustering and to start  working.  I just got back from Wyoming. They  are having  this  same debate  there.  They don’t trust us to finish it here.  They are trying to finish it on a local  basis. They are having a debate on a  constitutional amendment to be able  to do medical tort reform.  I tell you, that is a very difficult  thing. Litigation  reform  requires  a  constitutional  amendment  in Wyoming. That means there may be a vote  of the people, but that can’t happen  until at least November and we are in  a crisis in Wyoming right now. We are  not the only State in a crisis.  Last year, we brought a medical litigation reform bill to the Senate. The  legislation would have placed reasonable limits on the amount of money attorneys can take from a verdict or a  settlement  in  an  injured  patient’s  favor. The bill also would have limited  awards for punitive damages and noneconomic damages. In other words, the  pain and suffering awards.  The  bill would not have  limited  awards to compensate patients for economic  losses. This  is an  important  point for everyone to keep in mind. If  a judge and jury were to decide a person suffered an injury due to a doctor’s  mistake  or  a hospital’s negligence,  that person would be entitled to receive full compensation for their economic loss, including everything from  rehabilitation to lost wages resulting  from their injury. I cannot stress this  point enough. The bill would not have  limited awards  for any part of economic losses.  What the bill would have done  is  place a ceiling on noneconomic damages. The bill would have limited the  maximum award for noneconomic damages to $250,000 in States that do not  have their own limits on such awards.  In Wyoming, we do not currently  have  limits on noneconomic damage  awards. We do not have limits despite  evidence which shows limits on noneconomic damage awards have helped  control the cost of medical liability insurance premiums in other States.  As a result, people in Wyoming are  losing access to affordable health care  in their communities. The rising cost  of medical liability insurance in my  State of Wyoming is forcing doctors to  curtail their practices or close them  entirely. We have a shortage of doctors  in Wyoming as it is and the cost of  medical liability insurance is making a  bad problem even worse.  To address this problem, I cosponsored the medical litigation reform bill  we offered  for debate  last year. We  needed 60 Members in this body to vote  in favor of working on the bill to get  past a filibuster, but only 49 voted in  favor. So it was back to the drawing  board.  Here we are again, 9 months later,  with a new bill. It is ironic we are here  9 months later because this bill focuses  on mothers and babies.  Medical liability crisis affects many  patients and doctors. Those it affects  most are the expectant mothers and  their obstetricians.  Doctors who deliver babies have a dubious honor when it comes to medical  liability insurance. The typical obstetrician pays more in annual premiums  for  professional  liability  insurance  than almost any other type of doctor.  Part of the reason  is that  in some  states the child has the right to sue  when they get to adulthood. That is a  pretty long tail on the liability. If the  parent fails to sue, the child can sue.  Some of my colleagues have pointed  out the statistics and numbers on this  crisis, so  instead I will tell a short  story about an obstetrician  in Wyoming. I told this story in July so I  apologize if you have heard it before,  but it is worth retelling.  There was an article in the Washington Post about a year ago about the  medical liability crisis. The reporter  for the Post had gone to Wyoming to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:22 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S23FE4.REC S23FE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

83,30,2004-02-23,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to speak on the issue of medical  liability reform and the bill pending  before the Senate. This legislation is a  narrowed-down version of what myself  and Senator GREGG introduced  last  year, which in contrast was a broad-  based medical  liability  reform  bill.  Today we pared it down to limit it just  to OB/GYNs, nurse midwives, and any  other provider involved in the delivery  of babies.  to  The reason we have done this is fairly typified in my State and in many  other States around the country by  this picture. It is a real life picture  taken only days ago: the building moniker reads ‘‘OBGYN,’’ and next to it, a  sign now hangs that reads ‘‘For Lease,’’  and call a particular number. This sign  indicates how OB/GYNs are  leaving  practice  in my State and  in other  States across the country because they  can no longer afford their medical liability premiums.  This is a problem that some describe  as not that big a deal. But if you talk  to the women who cannot get obstetrical and gynecological services, it is a  crisis to them.  Southern Nevada is the fastest growing population center in the country.  We have 6,000 new people moving in a  month and are we not getting as many  new OB/GYNs as we need. We need a lot  of new doctors coming to our State.  But instead of new doctors arriving to  practice  in Nevada, we have doctors  limiting their practices and stopping  either  the practice of obstetrics or  leaving our State altogether.  The American Medical Association  has identified 19 States that are in crisis, and all but 5 States are showing  signs the crisis  is building  in their  State.  Some people have said: Well, this is  about rich doctors versus rich lawyers.  This is not about doctors versus lawyers. This is about access to care. This  is about a woman who is thinking: ‘‘I  want to have the best possible care for  my baby,’’ and she cannot find a doctor.  I have a good friend who lives in Las  Vegas. He  delivers  high-risk  pregnancies. These are the people you want  to have as your best doctors. However,  because of the huge increases in rates,  his insurance company has limited him  on the number of deliveries he can  make during the year.  That  is not what we want  to be  doing. We want to have the best people  delivering babies, especially for high-  risk  pregnancies which  require  the  most skill.  It is our legal system that is out of  control. Unfortunately, we have trial  lawyers out there who are taking advantage of our broken civil justice system. They are even advertising on TV.  I am sure many people, when they  watch TV, have seen these 1–800 numbers you can call to find somebody to  sue. It is basically: Bring your Rolodex  and we will figure out who you are  going to sue. That goes for almost anything today, but it is especially prevalent in the field of medicine.  Across America  the crisis  is happening not just with OB/GYNs. As a result, in this bill, we have decided to  focus also on nurse-midwives, the overall practice of delivering babies, and  providing gynecological care because it  is the most acute problem we are seeing across the country.  In my State, we did pass a medical liability reform bill in August of 2002,  but the only reason that it was able to  pass was because our trauma center  closed. It was the only level I trauma  center  for a region of 10,000 square  miles, and it closed because of the medical liability crisis. The only way that  trauma center was able to open again  was because the State decided to step  in and put its liability cap on anybody  who provided care through the level I  trauma center. People have been arguing that $250,000 is not enough. Well,  the State of Nevada’s cap on damages  is $50,000 for anyone who chooses to sue  a healthcare professional that provided  care at the trauma center. That alone  allowed the level I trauma center to  open.  This is the same level I trauma center where Roy Horn, the famous person  from the duo of Siegfried and Roy, was  treated when he was attacked by a  tiger. If it was not for the State of Nevada applying its $50,000 damage cap,  that trauma center would not have  been available for Roy. He certainly  would be in much worse shape today if  that had not been the case, and maybe  he would not have made it at all if that  kind of care was not available. This example  indicates the politics of what  can happen when a crisis gets so great  that the trial lawyers cannot stand up  and keep their stranglehold on our legislatures around the country.  Today, we need to have the same  thing happen in the Senate where people around the country call their Senators and say the crisis is too severe.  We need to have special interests, especially trial lawyers’ special interests,  put aside, and we need to put the practice of medicine first. We need to put  first access to quality care for women  and those new babies coming into the  world. We need to put their care above  all else.  Last year, the University of Nevada  School of Medicine had  the  lowest  number of students entering obstetrics  and gynecology it has had since 1999.  And,  equally  disturbing,  each  year  since 2000, that number has continued  to go down and down and down.  This chart shows the very clear contrast of what has happened in my State  and  other States  versus California.  Why do I put California up versus the  rest of the States in the country? The  reason  is because California enacted  what is known as MICRA. MICRA is  their medical  liability  reform  law  which they enacted in 1975. After withstanding eleven years of court challenges, it has now been in effect for  about eighteen years and we know it is  working.  By the way, the people in lawsuits  are getting plenty of compensation in  California. But the difference in premium  increases—California compared  to the rest of the country—is stark. In  California, from 1976 to today, there  has been a 167-percent increase. For the  rest of the country, however, it is over  500 percent. Moreover, these percentages do not reflect the last couple of  years. If the  last couple years were  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:22 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S23FE4.REC S23FE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

86,44,2004-02-23,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  introduce the U.S. Military Cancer Institute Research Collaborative Act of  2004. This  legislation would  formally  establish the U.S. Military Cancer Institute (USMCI), and support the collaborative augmentation of  research  efforts in cancer epidemiology, prevention and control. Although the USMCI  already exists as an informal collaborative effort, this bill will formally establish the institution with a mission  of providing  for the maintenance of  health in the military by enhancing  cancer  research and  treatment, and  studying the epidemiological causes of  cancer among various ethnic groups.  By formally establishing the USMCI, it  will be in a better position to unite  military  research efforts with other  cancer research centers.  Cancer prevention, early detection,  and treatment are significant issues for  the military  population,  thus  the  USMCI was organized to coordinate the  existing military cancer assets. The  USMCI has a comprehensive database  of its beneficiary population of 9 million people. The military’s nationwide  tumor registry, the Automated Central  Tumor Registry, has acquired more  than 180,000 cases in the last 14 years,  and a serum repository of 30 million  specimens from military personnel collected sequentially since 1987. This population  is predominantly Caucasian,  African American, and Hispanic.  The Director of the USMCI, Dr. John  Potter, is a professor of surgery at the  Uniformed Services University of the  Health Sciences (USUHS). A highly talented  cancer  epidemiologist,  Dr.  Kangmin Zhu, has also been recruited  to lead the USMCI Prevention and Control Programs.  The USMCI currently resides in the  Washington, DC area, and its components are located at the National Naval  Medical Center,  the Malcolm Grow  Medical Center, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and the Armed  Forces Radiobiology Research  Institute. There are more than 70 research  workers, both active duty and Department of Defense  civilian  scientists,  working in the USMCI.  The USMCI intends to expand its research activities to military medical  centers across the Nation. Special emphasis will be placed on the study of  genetic and environmental factors in  carcinogenesis among the entire population, including Asian, Caucasian, African American  and Hispanic  subpopulations.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  this bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.

A bill to amend title XIX of  the Social Security Act to provide 100  percent reimbursement for medical assistance provided to a Native Hawaiian  through  a  federally-qualified health  center or a Native Hawaiian care system; to the Committee on Finance.  ",2004
87,44,2004-02-23,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  introduce the Native Hawaiian Medicaid Coverage Act of 2004. This legislation would authorize a Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent (FMAP) of 100  percent for the payment of health care  costs of Native Hawaiians who receive  health care from Federally Qualified  Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian  Health Care System.  This bill was originally a provision  within the Medicare Prescription Drug  Bill, which the Senate passed by an  overwhelming majority of 76 to 21, but  was dropped from the final Medicare  Prescription Drug Conference Report.  This bill is modeled on the Native  Alaskan Health Care Act, which provides for a Federal Medicaid Assistance  Percent (FMAP) of 100 percent for payment of health care costs for Native  Alaskans by the Indian Health Service,  an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization.  Community health centers serve as  the  ‘‘safety net’’  for uninsured and  medically underserved native Hawaiians and other United States citizens,  providing comprehensive primary and  preventive health services to the entire  community. Outpatient  services  offered to the entire family include comprehensive  primary  care,  preventive  health maintenance,  and  education  outreach in the local community. Community  health  centers, with  their  multi-disciplinary approach, offer cost  effective  integration  of health  promotion and wellness with chronic disease management and primary care focused  on  serving  vulnerable  populations.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  this bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 2098  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Native Hawaiian Medicaid Coverage Act of 2004’’.

89,5,2004-03-04,Mr. LUCAS of Oklahoma.," Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from  New York (Mr. BOEHLERT) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. GORDON)  bringing  this  important bill  to  the  floor, because the emerging commercial human space flight industry presents tremendous opportunities for my  State of Oklahoma and our Nation as a  whole. I am particularly appreciative  of this bill’s intent to ease the regulatory burdens for entrepreneurs who  are developing new suborbital reusable  launch vehicles.  ",2004

92,5,2004-03-04,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  his kind  words. He is correct in stating that this  legislation seeks to put in place sufficient Federal regulation to protect the  general public while also promoting  this important new industry.  ",2004
93,5,2004-03-04,Mr. LUCAS of Oklahoma.," As you  know, Mr. Chairman, some suborbital  reusable launch vehicles that will be  used in commercial human space flight  activities may have some attributes  normally associated with airplanes as  well as many attributes of rockets. My  hope is that such hybrid vehicles would  not have to be regulated under two separate regimes. What are the chairman’s  views on this matter?  ",2004
94,5,2004-03-04,Mr. BOEHLERT.," I thank the gentleman for that question.  This  is a very  important  issue on  which we have worked extensively with  industry and the executive branch in  developing this bill. As currently drafted, H.R. 3752 incorporates definitions  promulgated by the Federal Aviation  Administration to distinguish between  suborbital rockets, which are under the  jurisdiction of FAA’s Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transport,  and  other  aerospace  vehicles  which are regulated by another part of  the FAA. That said, I would be happy  to keep working with the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) and other  interested parties as the bill moves forward to revisit the important issue of  how best to regulate hybrid vehicles  that are engaged in commercial human  space flight.  ",2004
95,5,2004-03-04,Mr. LUCAS of Oklahoma.," I thank the  chairman and I look forward to continuing to work with him and our colleagues in the other body to see if we  can create a single regime for hybrid  commercial space flight vehicles. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in support of  the Commercial  Space Launch Amendments Act. I would like  to commend my colleague from California for  his leadership, encouraging interest and activity  in  space exploration.  I also  commend  Ranking Member BARTGORDONand the new  Ranking Member of the Space Subcommittee  NICKLAMPSONof Houston, for helping make  this important bill much better.  Commercial  space  flight  is  at  a  crossroads—as  is our  federal space exploration  mission at NASA. Space tourism could revolutionize the human experience and could potentially become billion-dollar industry, creating  numerous jobs in high-tech manufacturing and  design. I believe that that will indeed happen  someday, although I would not go out on a  limb and predict whether it will be in two decades, or two centuries. But I do believe that  mankind’s natural curiosity and hunger for excitement will ultimately enable us  to break  through the gravitational bond that holds us to  the surface of this planet. And I am confident  that  the American  spirit will  allow United  States companies and scientists and explorers  to be on the forefront of that great endeavor.  As those companies develop, they may also  come to play a more integral role in complementing the NASA mission—allowing NASA to  focus on cutting edge exploration, while they  fulfill  the more-mundane heavy  lifting and  transport  functions. This could be extremely  valuable and cost-effective.  The question before us  though,  is  ‘What  should be the role of the federal government  in  the  development  of  commercial  space  flight?’ ’ I have always been a great supporter  of the NASA mission, and its non-commercial  manned and unmanned exploration of space.  I  feel  the search  for knowledge and understanding in this universe is noble and worthwhile. I believe that the NASA mission inspires  our children to excel in the sciences and math,  and thus helps stimulate the development of  American leaders in technology. And NASA is  a source of discovery and  innovation  that  drives our economy and development. All of  these  things make NASA well worth strong  federal investment.  Commercial space activity  is often associated with space tourism—a potential thrill for  the multi-millionaires of this world. I have no  problem with that. But if that is all that industry  is, an expensive amusement ride,  then perhaps  the  federal government should  limit  its  role  to  issuing safety guidelines and regulations  for  liability  insurance requirements and  waivers and then let the private sector do the  rest.  But if this industry has the potential to be a  huge source of  jobs and  revenues  in  the  United States, or if there can be some fruitful  collaboration with NASA, helping in education  and science, or training of astronauts, or tech  development—perhaps more federal financial  investment would be appropriate.  These are  the questions we have been  grappling with in the Science Committee over  the past year. Regardless of the answer, the  fact is that this industry is at a crossroads, and  it is time that we in Congress make it clear  what the federal role shall be, whether we will  obstruct their development, help drive this industry, or simply get out of the way.  H.R. 3752 makes great progress in defining  the federal role for commercial space launch,  and encouraging  this  industry  to get off  the  ground, if you’ll pardon the expression.  This Act will establish a framework for regulating the emerging commercial human space  flight  industry,  giving  the  responsibility  to  FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which currently licenses unmanned expendable launch vehicles that put commercial  satellites into orbit. It also creates a ‘ ‘permit’ ’  system to facilitate experimental test flights of  new vehicles, while retaining a  full  licensing  system for operational systems. H.R. 3752 will  also extend the existing liability indemnification  regime  for  the commercial space  transportation industry for another three years and require a study of how to ultimately phase out  that temporary regime.  These are prudent steps, worked out in a bipartisan way in the Space Subcommittee and  the whole Committee. I support this approach,  and will vote for this bill.  However, space  flight  is  intrinsically risky,  and we must make safety our primary consideration. We do not want a burgeoning space  industry to follow the example NASA has set  of  late—and make safety an afterthought.  I  have been calling for a change in the culture  at NASA, to one of openness and commitment  to the well being of our spacecraft and crews.  We must ensure that such a philosophy is adhered to in the private space sector as well.  I have authored two bills that I will introduce  soon, to make NASA safer. One will protect  employees from retaliation by managers when  they come  forward and bring  to  light safety  problems  that could  lead  to  the  loss of a  NASA spacecraft or the lives of crewmembers.  These worker protections would also extent to  contractors for NASA. I hope in the future to  work with the FAA, to ensure that such protections are in place in the commercial space industry.  First, we will need to pass this bill, and start  putting the regulatory structure in place. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the  same. ",2004

100,12,2004-03-04,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2004
101,12,2004-03-04,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Madam Speaker,  some military retirees, individuals who  are  eligible  for military  retirement  benefits as a result of a full-service career, are also eligible  for disability  compensation from the VA based on a  medical problem they incurred while in  the service. Due to a 19th Century law,  these  service-disabled  retirees must  surrender a portion of their retired pay  if they want to receive the disability  compensation to which they are entitled.  Nationwide more  than  550,000 disabled military retirees have been required to give up their retired pay in  order to receive their VA disability  compensation. For nearly 2 decades,  Madam Speaker, I have introduced legislation to correct this  longstanding  problem, commonly known as concurrent receipt, in the House of Representatives.  Last year our Republican Congress  and President George W. Bush reached  an historic agreement that changes the  100-year-old practice of having disabled  veterans pay  for their VA disability  out of their military retirement. The  new law greatly expands the CombatRelated  Special  Compensation Program, which we refer to as CRSC, by  repealing the 60 percent minimum disability  requirement which was  set  forth in the 2003 Defense Authorization  Act. Effective January 1, 2004, earlier  this year, CRSC is payable to any military retiree, including personnel who  qualify for reserve retirement, who has  at least 20 years of service, a Purple  Heart and/or injuries sustained while  performing military duty in a combat  situation or with military equipment  or during military training. Retirees  must apply to their military service for  CRSC payments, but there is no phasein period for the CRSC benefit.  The new law also phases in full concurrent receipt benefits over the next  10 years for those who have serviceconnected disabilities rated 50 percent  or higher. In addition, the law extends  concurrent receipt and CRSC coverage  to Reserve and National Guard retirees  who were inadvertently excluded from  the CRSC program when it was originally enacted. I am pleased to report  that  on February  1  approximately  150,000 disabled retirees began receiving their new benefits.  Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the  issue of concurrent receipt has become  something of a  ‘‘political  football.’’  Some of my Democratic  colleagues  have been working hard to convince  our Nation’s veterans that they are  truly dedicated to keeping America’s  promise to them. I find it highly ironic  that  these Members  are now  commending themselves  for their recent  leadership on an issue that I have been  VerDate jul 14 2003  00:08 Mar 05, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04MR7.028 H04PT1 ",2004

159,47,2004-03-04,Mr. BOND.," Madam President,  as  businesses and our economy restructure—a natural occurrence of the business  cycle—workers  in our  country  have done better overall.  ‘‘Overall,’’  however, does not mean everyone has  done better. Many have not, and those  are the people for whom the overall  benefits of restructuring or even the  so-called temporary nature of the unemployment  is of  little comfort because they want to work and provide  for their families but they do not have  a job.  Yesterday  afternoon,  the  Senator  from New Jersey was very loudly and  strongly decrying the outsourcing of  jobs, and he made, I believe—I did not  hear all of his statement—a very compelling case. At the same time, the  firm he was associated with announced  last fall it intended to establish an Indian unit with 250 employees working  on operations in technology. Now, how  does that square with not outsourcing?  That is something perhaps we should  discuss in a hearing or further debates.  But I just came across an interesting  article from Tom Friedman, certainly  not with a Republican base, but I think  a very good New York Times  international analyst. He was talking about  interviews he had with an Indian who  was a founder of 24/7’s customer call  center. He said: How can it be good for America to have all  these Indians doing our white-collar jobs? The reply was: All the computers are from Compaq. The  basic software is from Microsoft. The phones  are from Lucent. The air-conditioning is by  Carrier, and even the bottled water is by  Coke, because when  it comes to drinking  water in India, people want a trusted brand.  On top of all this . . . 90 percent of the shares  . . . are owned by U.S. investors [including  U.S. pension funds]. This explains why, although the U.S. has lost some service jobs to  India, total exports from U.S. companies to  India have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to  $4.1 billion in 2002. What goes around comes  around, and also benefits Americans. Mr. Friedman concludes his article  quoting the Indian gentleman saying: It’s unfair that you want all your products  marketed globally, but you don’t want any  jobs to go. And Mr. Friedman replies: He’s right. Which is why we must design  the right public policies to keep America  competitive  in an  increasingly networked  world, where  every  company—Indian  or  American—will seek to assemble the best  skills from around the globe. And we must  cushion  those  Americans  hurt  by  the  outsourcing of their jobs. But let’s not be  stupid and just start throwing up protectionist walls, in reaction to what seems to be  happening on the surface. Because beneath  the surface, what’s going around is also coming around. Even an Indian cartoon company  isn’t  just taking American  jobs,  it’s also  making them. Those are Mr. Friedman’s comments.  Madam President, I ask unanimous  consent that op-ed be printed in the  RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 2004]  WHATGOESAROUND. . .  (By Thomas L. Friedman)  BANGALORE, India—I’ve been in India for  only a few days and I am already thinking  about reincarnation. In my next life, I want  to be a demagogue  Yes, I want to be able to huff and puff  about complex  issues—like outsourcing of  jobs to India—without any reference to reality. Unfortunately, in this life, I’m stuck  in the body of a reporter/columnist. So when  I came to the 24/7 Customer call center in  Bangalore  to observe hundreds of  Indian  young people doing service jobs via long distance—answering the phones for U.S. firms,  providing technical support  for U.S. computer giants or selling credit cards for global  banks—I was prepared to denounce the whole  thing. ‘‘How can it be good for America to  have all these Indians doing our white-collar  jobs?’’ I asked 24/7’s founder, S. Nagarajan.  Well, he answered patiently, ‘‘look around  this office.’’ All the computers are  from  Compaq. The basic software is from Microsoft. The phones are from Lucent. The airconditioning is by Carrier, and even the bottled water is by Coke, because when it comes  to drinking water in India, people want a  trusted brand. On top of all this, says Mr.  Nagarajan, 90 percent of the shares in 24/7 are  owned by U.S. investors. This explains why,  although the U.S. has lost some service jobs  to India, total exports from U.S. companies  to India have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990  to $4.1 billion  in 2002. What goes around  comes around, and also benefits Americans.  Consider one of the newest products to be  outsourced to India: animation. Yes, a lot of  your Saturday morning cartoons are drawn  by  Indian  animators  like  Jadoo Works,  founded three years ago here in Bangalore.  India, though, did not take these basic animation jobs from Americans. For 20 years  they had been outsourced by U.S. movie  companies, first to Japan and then to the  Philippines, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  The  sophisticated,  and more  lucrative,  preproduction,  finishing and marketing of  the animated films, though, always remained  in America.  Indian animation  companies  took  the business away  from  the other  Asians by proving to be more adept at both  the hand-drawing of characters and the digital painting of each frame by computer—at  a lower price.  Indian artists had  two advantages, explained Ashish Kulkarni, C.O.O. of Jadoo  Works. ‘‘They spoke English, so they could  take instruction from the American directors easily, and they were comfortable doing  coloring digitally.’’ India has an abundance  of traditional artists, who were able to make  the transition easily to computerized digital  painting. Most of these artists are the children of Hindu temple sculptors and painters.  Explained Mr. Kulkarni: ‘‘We train them to  transform their traditional skills to animation in a digital format.’’ But to keep up  VerDate jul 14 2003  00:28 Mar 05, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04MR6.018 S04PT1 ",2004
160,54,2004-03-04,Mr. DODD., Will my colleague yield?  ,2004
161,54,2004-03-04,Mr. KENNEDY., I yield.  ,2004
162,54,2004-03-04,Mr. DODD.," I raise an issue, because  it has been raised in the last 24 hours  or so, that one of the things the administration is doing is putting resources  into vocational education, education  and job training. I know my colleague, from his extensive work in this area,  and knowing the committees we serve  on together deal with some of these  issues, but you might  just  recount  what the proposals are in vocational  education,  job training, all of these  programs  that would put more  resources out there to make it possible  when people lose their jobs to find additional work. Isn’t it a fact we are  cutting back in these budgets?  ",2004
163,54,2004-03-04,Mr. KENNEDY.," The Senator is quite  correct. The Senator probably remembers the State of the Union speech  where the President announced a new  program in association with community colleges—$250 million. Then he  went out the next couple of days and  went  to  community  colleges  and  worked with  local workforce groups  about this issue.  At the same time, they have cut $800  million from the identical training programs in the last two budgets. That is  the record. We can go back. I haven’t  got the appropriations here, but I know  it. I am familiar with it because we resisted it and we had amendments here.  Again, there was an amendment from  the Senator from the State of Washington  to  restore  the  training programs. Nonetheless,  those  programs  were cut.  You talk one way one day and another way another day. We saw the  classic example of it in the State of the  Union. We were talking about: Oh, yes,  we are going to have a workforce community-based community college program to upgrade the skills. But in the  previous year, and the year before, cutting  those work  training programs.  People aren’t  stupid on  this. They  know it. I am sure they know it in Connecticut.  I know they know  in my  State, on these workforce investment  boards, what is happening and its devastating impact.  We had a strong bipartisan effort,  when Senator Kassebaum and Senator  JEFFORDSchaired, as the Senator from  Connecticut remembers. First we had  the JTPA, a program we worked out in  a bipartisan way in the committee that  was chaired by Senator Dan Quayle.  People differ about Senator Quayle. He  was a stalwart on job training. It was  the only social program that passed, as  the Senator  remembers, during  the  first 4 years of President Reagan and it  took a lot of courage for Dan Quayle.  Then we went beyond that. Because  we had over 125 different job training  programs in 12 different agencies, we  wanted to get these pulled together, so  we had a Kassebaum-Kennedy commitment to get workforce training in one  place. It was bipartisan. We began to  fund it and then what happens? As soon  as we begin to get life in that, this administration effectively guts this program.  ",2004
164,54,2004-03-04,Mr. DODD.," I remind my colleague,  and I am sure he knows these numbers,  this year’s budget proposal  reduces  worker  investment programs by $400  million. So here you have 2.8 million  jobs  being  lost  in manufacturing.  Those people who cannot find work are  getting jobs at far less wages and salaries than they had in their previous  job. Yet we  find when  it comes to  worker  education  and  investment  issues the budget actually reduces the  amount we are going to commit to  those programs by almost a half a billion dollars. I wonder if my colleague  has something to say about that. ",2004
165,54,2004-03-04,Mr. KENNEDY.," The Senator is absolutely correct.  I answer the Senator in this way. The  Senator’s amendment is so timely. We  have three—I believe we have seven,  and I have others back at my office— national or  international magazines.  This is February 21, The Economist,  ‘‘New  Job  Migration.’’  Here  is  BusinessWeek, ‘‘Will Outsourcing Hurt  America’s Supremacy?’’ Here is Time  magazine, March 1,  ‘‘Are Too Many  Jobs Going Abroad?’’  These are national publications—national magazines. That is what the debate is about. The Senator from Connecticut has an amendment dealing  with these very issues. Nothing could  be more current.  Why aren’t we getting an opportunity to debate these  issues which  just about every publication  in  the  country understands is a major issue,  and certainly every working family in  this country understands. The Senator  has proposed an approach on this that  can make a major difference.  I am  troubled, as he must be, that he is not  able to get a clear-cut judgment decision.  ",2004
166,54,2004-03-04,Mr. DODD.," I thank my colleague. I  was prepared to vote. We offered the  amendment at about  3:30 yesterday  afternoon. This is a very simple proposal.  There  are  those  who  are  for  outsourcing. The administration has  indicated that it is a good thing for the  economy to outsource jobs. I presume  there are people in the Chamber who  share that view. Why not vote up or  down instead of going through the gyration of trying to find some cute way  of avoiding having to vote on this issue  or coming up with some phony alternative believing  that outsourcing  is  good for the economy? I think shipping  jobs away, destroying  the manufacturing base and human capital investment that makes it possible in the 21st  century for us to be competitive in a  global economy is the wrong way to  proceed.

167,61,2004-03-04,Mr. DURBIN.," I say to the Senator  from Connecticut, we have trade adjustment assistance, which was  enacted years ago, which says if a person  loses their manufacturing  job, a  job  that produces goods, to trade overseas,  they will have an extra advantage in  that we provide unemployment benefits and give an opportunity  for retraining.  We are in a new world now, and the  new world includes not just losing jobs  producing  goods  but  jobs  involving  services, and trade adjustment assistance does not apply. So the 4,000 computer programmers at IBM who gave  their jobs to India and China cannot  qualify  for  trade adjustment assistance. The Senator from Connecticut is  right; they then get into fierce competition for the limited jobs available  in America.  I have met with the men and women  who are  in the ranks of the unemployed, and  they are  finding  it extremely difficult to find any job that  pays nearly what they made before.  The first casualty of unemployment is  their health  insurance, and then, of  course, their home and their savings.  All of these things are casualties as  Congress not only is insensitive to this  loss of jobs overseas, this outsourcing  of jobs, but even fails to include unemployment insurance for these workers.  I  say  to  the Senator  from Connecticut—I will yield the floor because  I see another colleague—if the election  in November is a referendum on this  report as  to whether or not  it  is  healthy  for  America  to  see  jobs  outsourced and sent overseas, bring it  on.  If my colleagues think they can rationalize the sending of these jobs overseas because Mr. Mankiw and President  Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers  happen to have some theoretical model  behind them, they ought to take these  wonderful Wall Street models to Main  Street in America.  I hope before the end of the day we  will count noses in the Senate on the  Dodd amendment. Let us find out how  many people buy the Mankiw vision of  the world and how many people buy  the reality of this world.  ",2004
168,61,2004-03-04,Mr. DODD.,  I  thank my colleague  from Illinois very much. ,2004
169,61,2004-03-04,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from North Dakota.  ,2004
170,61,2004-03-04,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I have  listened to my colleagues from Illinois  and Connecticut discuss this issue. It is  interesting to me that the amendment  that  is offered by the Senator  from  Connecticut is portrayed by some as  some very substantial, potentially devastating piece of public policy that  could bring down the roof and undermine this economy. It is, of course,  nothing of the sort. It is a relatively  modest amendment, as a matter of  fact.  My colleague from Illinois, Senator  DURBIN, said he wants a vote on it. I  want a vote on this amendment. They  can second-degree  it until the cows  come home, but in the end we will get  a vote on this amendment. If we have  this kind of bill on the Senate floor, we  have a right to vote on this amendment.  The central question that is asked by  my colleague from Connecticut is this:  Should tax dollars be used to send jobs  overseas? I am going to have this followed up with another amendment asking, should we provide tax breaks to  send jobs overseas?  My colleague, Senator DODD, says— and I agree with him wholeheartedly— we ought not to have the American  people pay tax dollars into our Government and then have various functions  of Government decide where we are  going to do the essential functions that  we have to perform and then make a  decision: let’s do them in Bangladesh;  let’s do them  in  Indonesia;  let’s do  them in India. That is not something  we want to have happen with the dollars the American taxpayers pay into  their Government. Senator DODD says  let’s stop that, with some exemptions  and some exceptions.  It makes good sense to me. It is absolutely the right thing to do.  I am going to offer an amendment  which I will describe briefly. Senator  DODD talks about the use of tax dollars. Let me describe my amendment,  which is the use of tax breaks. If one is  an American company doing business  in this country and they decide they  want to set up a wholly owned foreign  subsidiary and they move their American  jobs to this  foreign subsidiary,  make the same product and then ship  the product back  into this marketplace, they lose what is called tax deferral. We actually now provide a tax benefit if you do that. We say if you do— shut  down  your  American  plant,  produce the same product overseas and  ship it back into this country—we will  give you a tax break. You don’t have to  repatriate your income. You don’t have  to pay taxes on that income.  So here are  two companies. Both  produce garage door openers, both are  located in the same American city. One  moves to Asia. Guess what. The one  that moves has a tax advantage over  the one that stayed. I am going to offer  an amendment that shuts that down  for products that are shipped back into  this marketplace by companies that  move their American jobs overseas. We  ought not provide a tax break for that.  That  is another amendment we will  vote on.  Again, when we bring this bill to the  floor, which is a tax bill, we have every  right to offer these amendments and  expect we will vote on them.  The second degree that has been offered just moments ago represents a  desire to prevent a vote on the amendment. Certification—this is an opportunity for an escape hatch, to allow  governments, in this case in the Dodd  amendment, to keep doing what they  have done in some cases, and that is to  outsource jobs overseas.  This obviously plays  right  to  the  question of the larger issue. Senator  DURBINsaid we have globalized. Indeed  we have. Globalization has moved very  quickly, very rapidly. I don’t suggest  we can in some way bring it back. This  economy is now a global economy.  What I do suggest is this: The rules  for this global economy have not kept  pace with the pace of globalization. We  fought for 100 years over some very important issues. Should workers have a  right to organize? Should they have  the right to expect they are working in  a safe workplace? Should they have a  right to expect someone is not going to  hire 12-year-olds to engage  in  labor  that will be undercutting workers in  this country? Do they have a right to  expect they are not working in a plant  that is dumping chemicals into the air  and the water?  We fought for 100 years over these  issues and resolved them. Now,  if a  company, or a government can polevault over all of those issues and say:  You know something, let’s just do our  business in Bangladesh or Indonesia or  India; we don’t have to worry about all  that; we can hire 12-year-olds and work  them 12 hours a day 7 days a week and  pay them 12 cents an hour and ship the  product to Fargo or Los Angeles or  Chicago, in my judgment there has to  be some basic admission price to the  American  economy,  to  the marketplace  in this country. The rules of  trade  have  not  kept  pace  with  globalization, and that is what is at  the foundation of this great debate of  ours about moving jobs overseas.  I understand why people move jobs  overseas, why corporations move jobs  overseas, why some governments do. I  don’t like it. I want to stop it. But I  understand why they do it.  It is about money. Huffy bicycles is  the best example I know. They were 20  percent of the American marketplace.  You could buy them at Sears, K-Mart,  Wal-Mart. Huffy bicycles were made by  proud people in this country making  $11 an hour in plants in Ohio. They  used to have between the handlebars  and the fender a little decal that was  the American flag.  Now that is gone. The last job performed in Ohio by the workers at the  Huffy bicycle plant was to take that  decal off and replace it with a decal of  the globe. The American flag is gone,  the globe is there. Why? Because Huffy  bicycle is now made in China. Not for  $11 an hour. Those folks lost their jobs  in Ohio because they were too expensive. Those jobs don’t exist here anymore. Those workers were fired. Now  Huffy bicycles are made in China by  people working 12 to 14 hours a day, 7  days a week for 33 cents an hour. They  come  to  this country, not with an  American flag on the front but with a  picture of the globe. In my judgment,  this is an appropriate way to describe  what has happened here.  Huffy bicycles,  if they had human  qualities, would have to have citizenship, and they would be American.

171,75,2004-03-04,Mr. BYRD.," Madam President,  on  January 3, 1963, DANIELINOUYEbecame  a U.S. Senator. Today,  15,036  days  later, he has become the fifth longest  serving Senator in American history.  This is yet another accomplishment  in the life and career of a remarkable  man and outstanding American.  I must point out, however, that his  has not been an easy or comfortable  life. It has  involved overcoming the  trials and tribulations of immigration  and discrimination.  Still, his has been a life of service to  our country. During World War II, he  served our country in the famed 442d  Infantry Regimental Combat Team of  World War II, the most decorated Army  unit in U.S. history. He was awarded  the Distinguished Service Cross, the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the  Congressional Medal of Honor, making  him one of only seven Senators to have  been  awarded  our Nation’s  highest  military honor. His war-time heroics  have now been documented in the film,  ‘‘Daniel  K.  Inouye:  An  American  Story.’’ His service to our country continued  in the U.S. Senate where he became the  first Japanese American ever to serve  in the U.S. Congress, and served on the  Senate Watergate Committee, the Congressional Iran Contra Committee, the  Senate Appropriations Committee, and  as Secretary of the Democratic Conference. I am pleased to point out that  Senator  will  soon  cast his  14,000th vote.  Personally,  I  have  always  appreciated and respected his deep loyalty to  the Senate and everything for which it  stands. I will never forget his loyalty  to me when I was the Senate Democratic leader. Whenever I needed his assistance, he was  there. Whenever  I  needed his vote, he was there. Whenever I needed his friendship, he was  there. In an address to the Senate last  July, I referred to Senator INOUYEas  ‘‘my hero in the Senate.’’ I am confident that he always will be.  Senator INOUYE is a dear colleague  and a remarkable man. Therefore, I  take great delight  in congratulating  him on achieving this momentous occasion.  I congratulate the Senator.

193,75,2004-03-04,Mr. HARKIN.," Madam President,  I  thank the Senator. I wanted to alert  fellow Senators what is going on. It is  obvious that the Republican side of the  aisle does not want to vote on the overtime bill. For some reason, they are  afraid to confront this issue. I don’t  want to take a lot of time. I would  agree to a half hour evenly divided. We  have debated  this  issue before. But  make no mistake about it, the Department of Labor is about to issue regulations that will strip overtime pay protections from 8 million workers in this  country.  This Senate, last year, on a bipartisan vote, passed my amendment to  disallow those regulations. The House  of Representatives also, on a bipartisan  vote, voted to uphold what we did in  the Senate. And  the administration  stripped it out on the Omnibus appropriations conference report.  They say this  is a  jobs bill. How  about the jobs of people who are working overtime in America? How about  the men and women who have given up  their premium time with their families  and with their kids, after work, on  weekends,  to work  overtime? What  about them? These are jobs, also. How  about the people unemployed right now  who would be employed but, if employers can work people over 40 hours a  week and not pay them a cent more,  why would they hire anybody else?  Last, as I said the other day and I  pointed out, this is a dagger pointed at  our veterans. You can look in the old  regulations. There is nothing in there  about training in the military causing  you to be exempt from overtime pay  protection.  Here, I blew it up on this chart. I am  not going to read the whole thing, but  basically it puts in these words: ‘‘training in the Armed Forces.’’ What does  that mean? It means if you get specialized training as a veteran and you  come out and go to work, you can be  exempt from overtime pay protection  simply because you got that training  in the Armed Forces. You aren’t called  a  ‘‘learned  professional’’ without  a  four-year specialized degree otherwise.  But not if you are a veteran. The regulations  would  substitute  veterans’  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:57 Mar 05, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A04MR6.017 S04PT1 ",2004

196,82,2004-03-04,Mr. STEVENS.," Madam President, I  ask unanimous consent that the attached eulogy be printed in the RECORD  today. Dr. James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress, delivered this eulogy  on Tuesday, March 2, 2004 at the funeral of Daniel Boorstin, who served as  Librarian of Congress from 1975 to 1987.  It also appeared in Rollcall yesterday. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  HON. JAMESH. BILLINGTON, LIBRARIAN OF  CONGRESS—EULOGYFORLIBRARIANOFCONGRESS EMERITUS DANIEL BOORSTIN,  J.  MARCH2, 2004 Dan Boorstin was a great American: the  inspirational head of two important national  institutions; a key  figure—along with his  friends Dillon Ripley and Roger Stevens—in  the cultural coming of age of our Nation’s  Capital; and a matchless chronicler of the  uniqueness, the innovative spirit and the everyday practicality of our shared American  experience.  He  was  an  exuberant  humanist  who  brought high literary style to a wide popular  audience. He put things together when others were taking them apart. He kept history  alive by telling it as his story at a time when  many were dehumanizing it, first with ideological prejudice and then with methodological pomposity. He was an optimist but  also a critic—providing us an early warning  of the difference between real and pseudo  events,  between  people who  actually  do  things and manufactured celebrities who are  simply well-known for being well-known.  He created in his two great trilogies an  original American version of the tradition of  sweeping, multivolume histories that flourished in England from Gibbon to Toynbee.  His longtime friend and colleague Jaroslav  Pelikan told me yesterday that Dan had  given him crucial early advice and encouragement as Jary was embarking on his own  monumental multivolume history.  It was fun to be with Dan in person and  through his writings. He mixed erudition  with  epigrammatic wit  and  colorful  vignettes. He could be contentious and even  temperamental, but almost always  in defense of  someone or  some  institution  to  which he was loyal at a time when it was  being unfairly maligned.  As Librarian of Congress he exemplified as  well as encouraged  the highest  scholarly  standards. At the same time, he threw open  the big bronze doors to let in the widest possible readership. From the time of my own  arrival in Washington to run the Wilson Center until the time I was chosen to succeed  him at the Library, he was a very special example, helpmate and friend.  Plato said that immortality lies in one’s  children and one’s books. Dan and his incomparable wife and effervescent editorial collaborator, Ruth, have opened both of those  pathways to an undying  legacy. His outstanding children have spoken today; and a  great extended family of readers yet unborn  will be benefitting from his books in the  years to come.  He was a man of the book, a gift to America from the people of the book. His bibliography itself fills a book. He founded and was  a benefactor to the Center for the Book within the world’s greatest collection of books at  the Library of Congress; and it now has— thanks to John Cole, whom he appointed to  head it—affiliated Centers for the Book in  all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Dan was concerned not just about illiteracy  but also about alliteracy—a term he coined  to describe those people who can read but  have lost the will to do so. And he launched  the plan and gained the congressional support to restore the Thomas Jefferson Building to its true glory as America’s temple of  the book. When he was sworn in in November 1975 as  the 12th Librarian of Congress in the Great  Hall of that magnificent building, he spoke  these prophetic words: ‘‘The computer can  help us find what we know is there. But the  book remains our symbol and our resource  for the unimagined question and the unwelcome answer.’’ In his last years he crafted a second trilogy  of books largely out of what he was fond of  calling the ‘‘multimedia encyclopedia’’ that  was and is the Library of Congress. He ended  up in his personal note to readers in the last  volume, The Seekers, asking a question that  lay beyond all the unwelcome answers. Has  Western man, he asked, emptied meaning  from life by moving from seeking purposes  to seeking causes—from deeply wondering  why to simply asking how? Books and family  gave meaning and purpose to the rich life of  this man—as they do to the American culture that he loved and ennobled.  Marjorie and I—like so many of his fond  admirers—will miss him and the infectious  enthusiasm  for  learning  that he miraculously sustained for nearly nine decades. We  will always be grateful for the friendship and  support that he and Ruth so generously and  warmly extended to us and to the amazing  institution in which we have been privileged  to succeed him. f  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  ADAMMOONEYANDPATRICKDORFF  ",2004
197,82,2004-03-04,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Madam President,  today I rise to pay tribute and to honor  a young man who was recently killed  in action in Iraq—1LT Adam G. Mooney, a soldier in the U.S. Army who was  killed during a search and rescue mission on January 25. First Lieutenant  Mooney was 28 years old.  Adam Mooney was a native of Cambridge, MD, assigned to the 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry, 10th Mountain Division of the U.S. Army, stationed at  Fort Drum, NY. After graduating from  high school in Dorchester County, MD,  in 1993, Adam attended the University  of Maryland Eastern Shore. He left college to enlist  in the Army, but returned to the university soon after to  complete his degree in aviation management science. Adam was a lifelong  enthusiast of aviation and flying—in  fact, he earned his pilot’s license at  about the same time he earned his  driver’s  license. In the Army, Adam  was able to further pursue the challenges of aviation while flying the OH– 58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter. His unit  was deployed to Iraq late last year,  where Adam flew helicopter missions  to provide support, security, and intelligence to ground troops.  On January 25, 1LT Adam Mooney  was flying a rescue mission near Mosul,  Iraq, in search of soldiers whose boat  had capsized on the Tigris River. According to witnesses, Mooney’s helicopter hit a power line and plummeted  into  the  river. The bodies of both  Mooney and his co-pilot, CWO Patrick  Dorff, were missing in the aftermath of  the crash—Dorff’s body was  found 4  days later, and Mooney’s 3 weeks later.  We extend our deepest sympathies to  their families, who certainly suffered  under great strain and emotional stress  while they awaited news of their loved  ones’ welfare.  Adam Mooney’s wife, Katie,  lives  with her parents in Conway, AR, where  she moved to work on her nursing degree while her husband was serving  overseas. Our deepest condolences and  prayers go out to her, as well as to  Adam’s  parents,  friends,  and  loved  ones, in this time of great loss for their  family. Adam was a courageous young  man, lost to us far too soon, but we remain confident that his sacrifice was in  a noble and honorable cause.  Thank you, Madam President.  f  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2003 ",2004
198,82,2004-03-04,Mr. SMITH.," Madam President, I rise  today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator KENNEDY and  I  introduced  the  Local Law Enforcement Enhancement  Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes  law,  sending a signal that violence of any  kind is unacceptable in our society.  A terrible crime occurred in Upland,  CA, in December 1999. There, a man  died after being hit in the head with a  pool cue by an attacker who accused  him of being gay.  I  believe  that Government’s  first  duty is to defend its citizens, to defend  them against the harms that come out  of hate. The Local Law Enforcement  Enhancement Act is a symbol that can  become substance. I believe that by  passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and  minds as well. f  HAITI  ",2004

200,89,2004-03-04,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Madam President, I  rise today with my colleague, Senator  DURBIN, to introduce the Small Employer Health Benefits Program Act of  2004.  This legislation seeks to address an  enormous problem facing small businesses in Arkansas and all across the  country: accessibility and affordability  of health insurance. I have talked with  many small business owners in Arkansas who have been forced to drop or  dramatically reduce health insurance  for their employees even though they  desperately want to offer it. Small employers say that offering health insurance has a positive impact on recruitment,  retention,  employee  attitude,  performance, health  status, and  the  overall success of the business. What  better way to get our economy going  again than to help small businesses  succeed?  Small businesses are the number one  source for jobs in Arkansas. And the  smaller the businesses, the less likely  they will offer health insurance. Nationally, 58 percent of all private sector  employers offer health insurance. Only  three States fall below this average:  my home State  of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Montana. Arkansas, rate  for private coverage is 43 percent.  That is why I am proud to introduce  legislation today that will offer small  employers a real solution to the problem  of  accessing  affordable,  comprehensive health insurance for their  employees. Our legislation calls for the  creation of a new Small Employers  Health Benefits Program which will  offer  small  employers  affordable  choices among private health  insurance plans by giving them access to a  large purchasing pool and negotiated  rates. Our bill combines the best of  what government-run health care, but  harnesses the power of market competition to bring down health insurance costs by using a proven government negotiator.  Under  our  bill,  small  businesses  across America would be able to pool  their risk and purchasing power together to offer affordable health insurance options for their employees. Based  on the successful Federal Employees  Health Benefits program, which has  provided  quality  benefit  choices  to  Federal employees for decades, our program would offer small businesses a  range of benefit packages from a variety of insurance companies, ensuring  them a choice of affordable products.  All small employers with under 100  employees could voluntarily participate in the new SEHBP. Why only 100  employees or less? We target help to  those who need it the most. Take Arkansas as an example. 87 percent of the  businesses in Arkansas with 100 to 200  employees do offer health  insurance.  However, most businesses in Arkansas,  76 percent to be exact, have less than 50  employees and less than one-third of  them are able to offer health insurance  to their employees.  Also under our bill,  if  employers  agree to pay a minimum percentage of  the premium for workers making under  $25,000, they would receive a refundable  tax credit  in return. Why only  lowwage workers? Studies show that more  than half of workers in firms under 100  people make  less  than  $25,000. And  firms with a high proportion of lowwage workers are much less likely to  offer insurance.  Further, current health tax-credits  are not targeted to those who need help  the most. A recent study shows that  only 28 percent of current health benefit tax expenditures will go to families  with incomes below $50,000 this year.  This is bad considering that these families account for more than half of all  families in our country. In contrast,  families with  incomes of $100,000 or  more comprise 14 percent of the population but will account for 26 percent of  all health benefit tax expenditures.  By giving small employers a refundable tax credit to defray part of the  employer contribution for low-income  workers, we  provide help  to  those  struggling  families who need  it the  most.  One of the best aspects of our program is that every person working for  a small business anywhere in the country—rural or urban—would have access  to a choice of plans. And workers who  move  from one SEHBP-participating  company to another anywhere in the  Nation would be able to maintain their  same health coverage.  For example, a  florist working  in  Helena, AR, who  is enrolled  in an  SEHBP nationwide plan could move to  Carbondale, IL, without changing her  health insurance. It’s that easy.  Consumers  are  protected  because  plans in SEHBP will be subject to the  same strict regulatory and solvency  standards applied to plans in FEHBP.  And small employers would be relieved  of the burden of comparing insurers,  benefit packages, costs and negotiating  contracts.  I hope that our colleagues will take a  careful  look at our  legislation and  present it to the small businesses in  their States. I hope they will ask them  about their struggle to find affordable  health insurance in today’s market and  see if they’d view this as a better alternative.  The number  of uninsured  in  our  country is alarming and should be a  national priority. It is apparent by the  statements of HHS Secretary Tommy  Thompson yesterday  that President  Bush’s administration doesn’t  recognize the severity of this crisis. Secretary Thompson said:  ‘‘Even  if you  don’t have health insurance in America, you get taken care of. That could  be defined as universal health care.’’ VerDate jul 14 2003  01:10 Mar 05, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A04MR6.048 S04PT1 ",2004
201,96,2004-03-04,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  rise to introduce legislation to recognize the importance and need for increased weather modification research.  Weather modification  is the general  term that refers to any human attempt  to alter the weather. While we may not  be able to stop Mother Nature entirely,  we can sometimes alter her course,  changing the weather in small, yet significant ways. These efforts have been  used in the U.S. for more than 50 years  to reduce crop and property damage,  optimize useable precipitation during  growing seasons and lessen the impact  of periodic, often severe droughts.  The weather modification projects in  Texas and other States in the U.S. are  much more than well considered responses to drought. They are trying to  use the  latest technological developments  in  the  science  to chemically  squeeze more  precipitation  out  of  clouds. Moisture that is needed to replenish fresh-water supplies in aquifers  and reservoirs. Political subdivisions  like water conservation districts and  county commissions have embraced the  technology of rain enhancement as one  element of a long-term, water-management strategy. This is critical to ensure growing populations have enough  water to meet future needs.  This bill will develop a comprehensive and coordinated national weather  modification  policy  through  federal  and  state  research and development  programs.  It will  also  establish  a  Weather Modification Advisory and Research Board within the Department of  Commerce to promote and expand the  practical knowledge of weather modification. Further, it recognizes the significance of state and federal collaboration in this endeavor.  I am proud to offer this legislation to  bring attention to this important research and I would urge my colleagues  to support the Weather Modification  Research and Technology Transfer Authorization Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows: S. 2170 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

226,117,2004-03-04,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, this has  been a difficult week from many perspectives. We  had  two  contentious  pieces of legislation, and we certainly  understand that on this side. As far as  the legislation now before the Senate,  it should not be such. I think there is  no question that the majority of the  Senate by far wants to pass the legislation that has been before the Senate  today and yesterday.  The issue that is now holding up this  legislation  is whether the Senate  is  going to vote on an overtime amendment that is being offered by Senator  HARKIN. It  is an  issue that we  feel  strongly about on this side. We want to  vote on whether the President should  go forward with these regulations. We  want to vote. We will take a half hour  evenly divided, we will take 20 minutes  evenly divided to get a vote on this  amendment. We are not stalling  for  time.  This is something that will have to  be dealt with sometime during the next  month or so in this legislature. We are  willing to work in any way to cooperate and get this bill done, but one of  the things we can’t do is not have a  vote on this overtime issue. Senator  DASCHLEand I have talked with Senator HARKINon four occasions at my  last count. We said: Senator HARKIN,  don’t offer this amendment; this legislation is important; we are trying to  get it passed. He has reluctantly agreed  every time not to move forward with  this legislation.  That is no longer part of what we are  able to do. We talked with Senator  HARKIN. He has been such a gentleman  as to how we proceeded on this. He will  continue to be a gentleman, but he is  not going to relent offering this legislation because we do not  think he  should anymore.  I say that with the full knowledge  that on this very important piece of  legislation we are willing to vote, we  are willing to discuss the amendments  that Senators GRASSLEY and BAUCUS  have. They want to improve the legislation. I think they can do that, and I  think their amendments will be supported.

227,124,2004-03-04,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Sister June Favata for her years of  service and dedication to the young women of  Saint Vincent Academy in Newark, New Jersey. Sister Favata was honored at the Celebration of the Life of Monsignor Geno Charles  Baroni  luncheon on Tuesday, November 25,  2003, at the North Ward Center in Newark.  Sister June Favata has been a Sister of  Charity of Saint Elizabeth for 42 years, dedicating most of her time and focus to the education of young women at Saint Vincent Academy. Sister Favata began her career at Saint  Vincent Academy as an English  teacher  in  1969. After years of hard work and innovative  thinking, she became program director of the  Administrative team in 1978, and assumed the  position of administrative director in 1985.  For over 30 years, Sister Favata has helped  to establish several interdisciplinary programs  at Saint Vincent Academy,  focused on preparing students  for  the  rigors of college by  promoting  self-discipline, personal  responsibility, and enhancing academic skills and work  ethic. Sister Favata, along with other colleagues, spearheaded  the Students-in Community Program, a tool used to integrate social  responsibility with  formal education.  It  is an  opportunity for students to learn of the underlying causes of social  issues, while volunteering and helping out their respective communities.  Sister June Favata has  received several  awards for her dedicated service to the City of  Newark and Saint Vincent Academy, such as  the Distinguished Secondary School Teacher  Award in the State of New Jersey from Princeton University; Community Leadership and  Service Award  from Saint Benedicts Preparatory School; and the Miracle Maker Award  from the United Way of Essex and West Hudson.  Sister Favata is a life-long New Jersey resident, and received her bachelor’s degree  in  English  from  the College of Saint Elizabeth  and her master’s degree in Communication Art  from the University of Notre Dame.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Sister June Favata for her dedicated  and tireless service to her community and for  34 years of outstanding leadership to the students of Saint Vincent Academy of Newark. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO TERRY  WINDNAGEL  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 4, 2004 ",2004
228,124,2004-03-04,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am privileged  to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Terry  Windnagel for his extraordinary patriotism and  valor during his service to this nation. Terry  was a helicopter door gunner with the Navy  Seawolves  of Helicopter Attack Squadron  Three, and as a result of his heroic efforts was  recently inducted into the Navy Enlisted Combat Aircrew Roll of Honor. This special honor  is a  testament  to Terry’s patriotism, and  I  would like to take this opportunity to recognize  him before this body of Congress and this nation today.  The distinction of being  inducted  into  the  Navy Enlisted Combat Aircrew Roll of Honor is  one of  the highest honors  that can be bestowed on an enlisted member of the military  who served as an aircrewmen, flew in combat,  and served with distinction. As a result of his  many selfless and brave actions during  the  time spent  in combat, Terry Windnagel now  joins a select group of only six hundred and  fifty fellow patriots that have been selected for  this honor. While serving abroad, Terry flew in  over  five  hundred  combat missions,  and  earned many combat decorations,  including  the Purple Heart, single action Air Medal,  combat action  ribbons, and many personal  and unit citations.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is quite clear  that Terry  Windnagel is a man who possesses unparalleled dedication and commitment  to serving  his country. His life is the very embodiment of  what makes this country great, and it is my  distinct pleasure  to honor Terry before  this  body  of Congress  and  this  nation  today.  Thanks for your service to this country. f  CONGRATULATING THE ELK RIVER  ELKS ON THEIR VICTORY IN THE  MINNESOTA STATE HIGH SCHOOL  CLASS DOUBLE–A GIRLS HOCKEY  TOURNAMENT  HON. MARK R. KENNEDY  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 4, 2004 ",2004
229,124,2004-03-04,Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to congratulate the Elk River Elks  on their victory in the Minnesota State High  School Class Double-A Girls Hockey Tournament. The championship game on Saturday, February 28th, capped the 10th year that  girls hockey has held a state tournament.  The Elks  finished a 29– 2 season with a  thrilling 3– 2 overtime victory over North Saint  Paul, before a crowd of almost 2,500  fans  from across Minnesota. This was the first trip  to  the  state  championship game  for both  teams.  Coached by Barry Hohlen,  the Elks came  from behind to tie the game in the 3rd period  on a goal by Erin Olson, her second of the  game. 59 seconds into overtime, senior Anya  Miller, a Ms. Hockey  finalist, scored on a  slapshot to give Elk River the title. Both Olson  and Miller were named to the all-tournament  team.  Mr. Speaker,  I congratulate  the students,  coaches and fans from Elk River High School  on their championship season. It’s a great tribute to their hard work, dedication and overall  team effort. I know that everyone in the State  of Hockey is proud of their accomplishments.

230,131,2004-03-04,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to express my support and appreciation for the  Civil Air Patrol. In December 1, 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, in the great  tradition of American volunteering and patriotism, civilian aviators and watchers organized  the Civil Air Patrol to help protect our borders.  During World War  II,  they attacked 57 submarines and sunk 2 in addition to diligent reporting of suspicious sightings. In recognition  of their contribution to the war effort, President  Roosevelt declared the Civil Air Patrol an auxiliary of the Air Force.  The Civil Air Patrol represents what is great  about America. Volunteers come  together  to  assist each other in defending our homeland.  The government did not direct them, but they  cooperated with  the government  to help all  Americans.  The Civil Air Patrol has  three missions.  It  assists with Emergency Response throughout  the country. The Michigan Wing  flew more  mission hours  than any other Great Lakes  wing. Second, it works with students to teach  aerospace science and aviation. The Michigan  Wing was given an award by the National Civil  Air Patrol headquarters for the best aerospace  education program in the Great Lakes.  And third, it trains Cadets. Today, I met with  Lt. Col. Tim Neill and three Michigan Cadets,  Cadet Lt. Sean Croff, Cadet 2nd Lt. Holly  Growe, and Cadet Captain Teresa Olson, who  impressed me with their intelligence and dedication. Like many young people they have a  desire to serve their country and understand  how they can contribute to our country and to  our armed services. And  they are  learning  about aerospace science and aviation. Additionally, learning discipline and hands on technical experience is excellent.  I applaud  these young men and women,  and I understand their contributions. When I  was in graduate school in Delaware, I was the  squadron Commander in the Civil Air Patrol.  As one of the pilots, I flew search and rescue  missions and understand the real contribution  that Civil Air Patrol makes to our ‘ ‘Homeland  Security’ .  Mr. Speaker, we all thank the leaders and  students that give their time for the Civil Air  Patrol. They represent  the best  traditions of  America. f  NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK  HON. MARK STEVEN KIRK  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 4, 2004 ",2004
231,131,2004-03-04,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize National Peace Corps Week which is  being celebrated March 1–7 around the country. National Peace Corps Week recognizes  the important role the Peace Corps has played  over the last 43 years and reaffirms our country’s commitment to the mission of the Peace  Corps, as vital today as it was over 40 years  ago.  The first Peace Corps volunteers were sent  to Ghana in 1961. Since then, over 170,000  Peace Corps Volunteers have served in 137  countries  to promote  the Peace Corps’ mission of world peace and friendship.  Last year, the number of individuals applying to serve in the Peace Corps rose by 10  percent. These Americans are eager to serve  their nation by acting as  teachers, business  advisors,  information  technology consultants,  and youth and agriculture workers. These Volunteers transfer life-changing knowledge and  skills that are valued by the people of other  nations.  Currently, more than 7,500 Volunteers are  serving in 71 countries around the world— this  is the highest number of Volunteers in the field  in 28 years. Today’s Peace Corps  is more  vital  than ever, stepping  into new countries  like East Timor, working in emerging and essential areas and committing more than 1,000  new Volunteers as a part of President Bush’s  HIV/AIDS Act of 2003. Peace Corps Volunteers continue  to help countless  individuals  who want to build a better life for themselves,  their children, and their communities.  National Peace Corps Week recognizes all  Peace Corps Volunteers, past and present. I  would specifically  like  to recognize  the  forty  volunteers from my congressional district who  are currently serving around the globe. These  people and all Peace Corps Volunteers have  my gratitude for committing two years of their  life to their country and to the spread of democracy  through  the goals of  the Peace  Corps. f  FREEDOM IN HONG KONG  HON. CHRISTOPHER COX  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 4, 2004 ",2004
232,131,2004-03-04,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker,  the House Policy  Committee met today with a distinguished delegation of Hong Kong  legislators and advocates of democracy. I would like to briefly report on this meeting.  Last year, the Policy Committee met twice  with representatives from Hong Kong:  First, on January 28, 2003, we met with  Hong Kong representatives, including journalists, who briefed us on the PRC’s efforts to restrict media and intellectual freedoms. Second,  on June 5, 2003, we met with a delegation of  legislators and human rights advocates. Today’s was our third meeting on Hong Kong in  the 108th Congress.  The Policy Committee has held approximately 30 meetings  in  the 108th Congress.  The policy-setting organization for the House  Majority has devoted fully 10 percent of our  meeting  time  to  the cause of  freedom  for  seven million people on the other side of the  earth for several reasons:  First, we are the policy-setting organization  for  the Republican majority. Our party was  founded 150 years ago— more accurately, 149  years, 11 months, and two weeks ago— on the  simple idea of individual freedom. Republican  presidents helped secure freedom for millions  of Americans in the Civil War and for millions  more around  the world  in  the Cold War.  Today, President Bush has naturally made  freedom around the world the primary means  of securing victory in the war on terrorism. The  basis of our party is freedom, and Hong Kong,  today, is on freedom’s frontier.  Second, the seven million people of Hong  Kong represent the best hope for more than a  billion others in Asia. It is vitally important to  the world that China becomes more like Hong  Kong, and not the other way around. Accomplishing that goal would be in the interests of  the people of Hong Kong and all of China, and  it would be  in  the  interests of  the United  States and the rest of the world, as a free,  democratic, and prosperous China would be a  more stable and friendly neighbor and member of the international community.  One month after our previous meeting, the  Hong Kong legislature was scheduled to vote  on a PRC-backed  law  to severely  limit  free  speech and civil liberties in Hong Kong, in the  name of punishing ‘ ‘subversion.’  We and the  House International Relations Committee proposed, and the House approved, a resolution  in support of  freedom  in Hong Kong, and  against the proposed anti-subversion law. Unprecedented demonstrations by over one-half  million people in Hong Kong followed a few  days  later. The PRC withdrew  the so-called  anti-subversion legislation it was backing.  While the withdrawal of the so-called antisubversion bill was good news, the more recent PRC freeze on the consultative process  to provide  for  the popular election of Hong  Kong’s chief executive in 2007, and of its legislature in 2008, is of grave concern. It is vital  to commence this process immediately. China  will host the Olympics in 2008. Will the world  discover that China has broken its promise?  Only if the free world holds China to its commitment, and elections are held in 2007 and  2008, will this global shame be avoided.  Likewise, all the people of Hong Kong— including those who speak out for democracy— must be allowed the freedom to return to travel within China. The refusal of Beijing to grant  permission for Chinese patriots in Hong Kong,  including many who were born on the mainland, to travel to Beijing is an affront to freedom and to the Olympic spirit.

235,5,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 552 and ask  for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. RES. 552 Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the  House resolved into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for  consideration of the bill (H.R. 339) to prevent  frivolous lawsuits against the manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of food or non-alcoholic beverage products that comply with  applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The first reading of the bill shall be  dispensed with. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one  hour equally divided and controlled by the  chairman and ranking minority member of  the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for  amendment under the five-minute rule. It  shall be in order to consider as an original  bill for the purpose of amendment under the  five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the  Committee on the Judiciary now printed in  the bill. The committee amendment in the  nature of a substitute shall be considered as  read. All points of order against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to the  committee amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be  in order except those  printed in the portion of the Congressional  Record designated for that purpose in clause  8 of rule XVIII and except pro forma amendments  for  the  purpose  of  debate. Each  amendment so printed may be offered only  by the Member who caused it to be printed  or his designee and shall be considered as  read. At the conclusion of consideration of  the bill for amendment the Committee shall  rise and report the bill to the House with  such amendments as may have been adopted.  Any Member may demand a separate vote in  the House on any amendment adopted in the  Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the  committee amendment in the nature of a  substitute. The previous question shall be  considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. ",2004
236,5,2004-03-10,The SPEAKER pro tempore., The gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS) is  recognized for 1 hour.  ,2004
237,5,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, for the  purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to my friend, the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr.  MCGOVERN), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. b1100  During consideration of this resolution, all time is yielded for the purposes of debate only.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us  is a fair and open rule that allowed  every single Member of this body to  offer any amendment that they wished  to  debate  after  simply  having  it  preprinted  in  the  RECORD. On March 4, the Committee on  Rules publicly notified Members of the  CONGRESSIONAL  possibility that it may report a rule to  give every Member of Congress an opportunity  to have  their amendment  heard on the House Floor, giving Members ample time to draft and submit  their amendments for consideration.  The rule also provides one hour of  general debate,  equally divided and  controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary, and allows the amendment  in the nature of a substitute to be considered an original bill for the purpose  of amendment, and that it shall be considered as read.  The rule waives all points of order  against the committee amendment in  the nature of a substitute and provides  that only the authoring Member or a  designee may offer a preprinted amendment. Finally, the rule provides the  minority with one motion to recommit  either with or without instructions.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the rule for H.R. 339, the Personal  Responsibility and Food Consumption  Act. This bill is common sense legislation that requires courts to dismiss  frivolous lawsuits seeking damages for  injuries resulting from obesity and its  attendant health problems  that are  filed against the manufacturers, distributors, sellers, marketers, and advertisers of any  food product by a  claimant or their spouse, parent, or  child. That is, simply put, what this  bill does, and I would like to congratulate our chairman of the Committee on  the Judiciary, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER) and the  bill’s  sponsor,  the  gentleman  from  Florida  (Mr. KELLER)  for their hard  work in bringing this legislation to the  floor for its consideration today.  Despite its opponents’ claims to the  contrary, what this bill does not do is  to relieve manufacturers of their existing Federal and State responsibilities  for manufacturing, marketing, distributing, advertising, labeling, or selling  their products, nor does it affect existing State laws against deceptive trade  practices or lawsuits filed for the relief  of claimants who become sick  from  tainted food products. This bill is a  carefully crafted bill to address a specific problem: to put an end to frivolous  lawsuits  that have  been  filed  against the lawful and productive food  services industry, an industry that provides 12 million Americans with jobs  and is the Nation’s largest private sector employer. And, it accomplishes this  while protecting all of the other rights  currently given to consumers.  This bill simply codifies the current  tort law of every State in America that  already has preventive injury claims  based on obesity and makes permanent  what a recent Gallup poll has shown  that 89 percent of Americans already  knew: that lawsuits against the food  industry are an attempt by the trial  bar to make an end-run around our Nation’s established democratic process  through litigation. H.R. 339 creates a  narrow, national solution to the problem of these costly and wasteful lawsuits, and establishes in Federal law  VerDate jul 14 2003  00:07 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10MR7.005 H10PT1 ‘ ‘ ’ ’ ",2004

239,12,2004-03-10,Mr. MCGOVERN., I yield to the gentleman from Texas. ,2004
240,12,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I believe we had an open rule last week.  ",2004
241,12,2004-03-10,Mr. MCGOVERN.," We have had one  open rule out of, I think, nine, but I  mean, it seems that now we are being  required to preprint all our amendments in advance, which by my colleagues’ own definition is a restrictive  rule. Is that the wave of the future?  ",2004
242,12,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.,"  I  thank  the gentleman for allowing me to respond. The  Committee on Rules, when we file the  rule and when we prepare these documents ahead of time, we notify every  Member of Congress of our intent to  have a meeting at the Committee on  Rules to consider a subject. We ask  them to please preprint those things  that would be necessary. We ask every  Member to please work with legislative  staff who would help in preparing those  documents to make sure that they are  in order, would be made in order under  the rule, under the rules of this House,  and we believe we are trying to do  things  to move  legislation  forward,  allow time just as we have done here,  notify people ahead of time.  One of the things about this process  is that for years and years the House  has worked off Jeffersonian rules. We  have a Speaker who is up here. We have  a parliamentarian. We have people who  make decisions about what is right and  what is wrong and what is fair and  what is not, and we believe what we  have done here today from March 4 was  said here on the floor of the House, all  Members of Congress—— ",2004
243,12,2004-03-10,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker,  reclaiming my time, I appreciate the answer. I guess the question that I asked  to the chairman of the Committee on  Rules, and I will ask the gentleman  from Texas, if a Member of either party  is watching this debate and would like  to offer an amendment based on something that they have heard here today,  do they have the right to come to the  floor and offer an amendment at this  particular point?  ",2004
244,12,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, if the  gentleman would yield, the answer is  no.  ",2004
245,12,2004-03-10,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Okay. So, again, it  kind of makes my point of the restrictive nature of this process, and I raise  this issue because I hope that this is  not going to be a trend where Members  are going to be restricted.  Again, it is not just something the  Democrats  feel  passionately  about.  Again, I have been reading quotes from  Republicans over the years who  feel  very passionately about  the  importance of not having preprinting  requirements because they believe that  that constitutes a restrictive rule. So I  think that there is a bipartisan consensus here that we should move away  from restricting debate and restricting  what can be offered and opening up this  process on controversial bills and on  noncontroversial bills. That is the only  point I would make to the gentleman.  With regard to the bill that we are  talking about here today, I will again  say that I regret that we are dealing  with this particular bill today because  it does not address any real problem.  This is a bill that corrects a problem  that does not exist. These lawsuits that  people are complaining about with regard to obesity and the fast food industry are being routinely dismissed. This  is not a problem.  The problem is obesity. The problem  we should be talking about here is how  to make sure that our kids get more  nutritious  foods. The  issue  that we  need to be dealing with here is how to  make sure that the Federal programs  that provide breakfasts and lunches to  our children in schools meet proper nutrition guidelines.  The issue we should be talking about  is better labeling, informing the public  in a better way about what, in fact,  they are eating. We should be encouraging more corporate responsibility by  the fast food industry, and that is not  being debated here. In fact, what we  are trying to do is we are sending the  exact opposite signal to the fast food  industry.  We should be encouraging more physical  fitness programs  in our schools  and so that our young people can take  advantage of them, and we should also  be having a discussion on this floor  about the issue of hunger, which is relevant to this issue of obesity.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, people who have precious little  resources tend to buy things that are  high in calories, that are not nutritious, and there is a relationship between hunger and obesity, and  it  is  something we never even talk about on  the floor of this House.  But then we bring this bill to the  floor. We bring this bill to the floor,  and we are telling the people who are  watching here today that we are addressing a huge problem out there, a  problem that does not exist, and we are  bringing this bill up today and we are  only in for a couple of days, notwithstanding the fact that we are not dealing with the issue of extending unemployment benefits  to  those workers  who are unemployed, which is a national disgrace.  I do not know how people can come  here and appear on the House  floor  with a straight face having not dealt  with that issue. I know the gentleman  from Texas’  (Mr. SESSIONS) district,  like my district, includes a number of  people who are out of work, who have  run out of their unemployment benefits, who are desperately trying to figure out how to make ends meet, put  food on their table and pay their bills,  and they are  looking to us to help  them out, to provide them a bridge  until they can get a job. We are not  doing anything here, and we should be  ashamed of that fact.  The gentleman  from Oregon mentioned the transportation bill that is  kind of languishing in committee. That  will put people to work, but we are not  dealing with that. We are not dealing  with the issue of those who do not have  health insurance. We are not dealing  with anything that matters to anybody, and here we are again dealing  with an  issue that really  is trivial.  This place  is becoming a Congress  where trivial issues are debated passionately and important ones not at  all.  So, for a whole bunch of reasons, I  oppose the rule because it is restrictive, and I oppose this bill because it is  silly. We should not be dealing with  this today. We should be dealing with  something important. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2004
246,12,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks, and include extraneous material.)  ",2004
247,12,2004-03-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  House has, in the 8 years I have served  in it had debate after debate, hours on  the floor, to make sure that we discuss  the issues that are of relevance and important to the American public, but  these same things also take place, the  debates, in our committee system, and  committees hold hearings. Committees  go around the country to hear testimony  from people about  issues  like  obesity,  like prescription drugs,  like  health care, that are important to the  American public and to our health and  to our safety.  Mr. Speaker, these issues about obesity and about what the answer would  be, we hear from the trial lawyers that  they want to open up the floodgates,  and we hear from people who are engaged from the nutritional side talking  about how better  labeling would be  good or how food that is served to our  children should be leaner and have less  fat. We have heard from people like Dr.  Kenneth Cooper  from Dallas, Texas,  talk about how our children need more  physical fitness and to be more active.  All of these things have contributed to  a part of what this bill is about.  Mr. Speaker, I will  include  in the  RECORDat this point the testimony of  Dr. Gerard Musante, who is the founder  of the Structure House, before the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative  Oversight and the Courts on October 16.

249,19,2004-03-10,Mr. WATT.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I want to start by putting a couple of  things  in perspective. First of all, I  agree with a lot of what the gentleman  from Wisconsin  (Chairman  BRENNER) has said about personal responsibility, so I want to go on record  as saying that. I personally like fast  food on some occasions, but I also take  personal responsibility for my own fitness. So I am not here about personal  responsibility. People do have personal  responsibility.

250,26,2004-03-10,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows: Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. SENSENBRENNER: Section 3(c)(1), strike  ‘‘In any qualified  civil liability action,’’ and insert ‘‘In any action of the type described in clause (i) or (ii)  of section 4(5)(B),’’.  Section 3(d), strike ‘‘section 4(5)(A)’’ and  insert ‘‘section 4(5)(B)(i)’’.  Section 4(5), strike ‘‘The term’’ and insert  ‘‘(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C),  the term’’.  Section 4(5), strike ‘‘any person, but shall  not include—’’ and insert ‘‘any person.’’ Section 4(5), insert after ‘‘any person.’’ (as  inserted by the preceding instruction) the  following: (B) Such term shall not include– Section 4(5), strike ‘‘(A) an action’’ and insert ‘‘(i) an action’’.  Section 4(5), insert ‘‘or’’ after ‘‘obesity;’’.  Section 4(5), strike ‘‘(B) an action’’ and insert ‘‘(ii) an action’’.  Section 4(5), strike ‘‘; or’’ and insert a period.  Section 4(5), strike subparagraph (C) and  insert the following: (C) Such term shall not be construed to include an action brought under the Federal  Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.)  or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.). ",2004
251,26,2004-03-10,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Chairman, my amendment does not alter the  substance of the bill, it simply clarifies  it further. First, to clarify and ensure  consistency in interpretation, it simply  amends one phrase in the bill’s stay  provisions  in Sec. 3(c) to track  language used in the bill’s pleading requirements in Sec. 3(d). Second, it replaces Sec. 4(5)(c) with language making it clear that the term ‘‘qualified  civil liability action’’ does not include  an action brought under the Federal  Trade Commission Act or the Federal  Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  I believe that this change satisfies  the objections that the Committee on  Energy and Commerce levied against  the bill.  I would urge the Members to support  my clarifying amendment.  ",2004
252,26,2004-03-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the amendment.  (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.) ",2004
253,26,2004-03-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of this amendment. I rise in  support of the thesis that we should be  considering these matters.  This legislation is a very important  part of the administration’s program.  Just think what it does for this Nation.  It says that civility liabilities actions  in Federal, State courts against food  manufacturers, distributors or sellers  that are based on a claim that the person’s  food  consumption  resulted  in  weight gain, obesity or a health condition  that  is associated with weight  gain or obesity is terminated. A very  important step.  Now let me give you the history of  what we are talking about here, because the administration has an economic program and it is an important  economic program and the American  people need to know what it is.  First, the Chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisors said that the transportation of American jobs abroad or  outsourcing is a normal part of trade  and he supports it. Second, the administration has come forward with a serious attempt to expand the definition of  manufacturing in this country, something which is very important, especially if you are sending manufacturing  jobs overseas. And this administration  has sent 2.7 million manufacturing jobs  overseas. They have also lost 3.3 million jobs in the United States. So there  is a serious attempt on the part of this  administration to grapple with that  problem.  They seek to see to it that we can  change the definition of manufacturing  jobs now so that they cover fast food  handling.  Just  think  of what  this  means in terms of jobs for the American people. Jobs  in manufacturing  that paid $27 an hour will now pay minimum wages at McDonalds or Wendy’s  or Burger King or somebody like that.  But just think of the number of new  jobs that they can create.  Now, this bill  is going to protect  those new manufacturing jobs against  the prospect of lawsuits which might,  in some way, jeopardize the expansion  of the American economy and the creation of new jobs in manufacturing. b1315  I  think  that  this  tells us many  things. First of all, it says they no  longer care about autos or steel or aircraft  or  other  important manufacturing  concerns  and  interests  that  mean jobs, real jobs for the American  people, but at least it means that they  are paying attention to the fact that  we have got to have something done for  job creation in this country. It means  that they are finally recognizing that  we have to protect some portion of the  American economy.  The  fact  that  they are beginning  with fast food, and food should not be a  source of condemnation but rather one  of praise, because it means that after a  long slumber, they have come alert to  a significant problem, the  fact that  they are not competent to come forward with a real solution, which puts  Americans back to work in real jobs,  which would enable Americans to have  jobs, which will enable them to feed  their families, to house them properly,  to see to it that they are properly educated or go to college is only a beginning.  We must hope that with the assistance of this body and the passage of  this  important  legislation  that perhaps, just perhaps, we will begin down  the  road  towards  doing  something  about protecting American manufacturing,  about  protecting  American  manufacturing jobs and about seeing to  it that Americans go back to work.  I do not want my colleagues to denigrate  the administration.  It  is not  funny. It is sad, and what I want to say  to my colleagues is, it is time we do  something more than  just pass this  kind of legislation.  Let us address the problem of the  sanctions that the Europeans are getting ready to put on American manufacturers and American industry and  the American economy. There is a discharge  petition  down  here  at  the  clerk’s desk. My colleagues can sign on  it if they want. We can begin to address  the fact that this administration does  not care about manufacturing,  that  they have  lost millions of manufacturing jobs, that they are not able to  be truthful about it.  Last month, we  got  22,000  jobs  through. In these jobs, 21,000 of them  were government jobs, State and local.  They were not manufacturing. They  were not jobs that put people to work,  and they were not jobs that increase  productivity  for  the economy. They  were just jobs in the service industry.  If my colleagues look, they will find  that there are hundreds of thousands of  Americans every month who are falling  off the unemployment rolls. If my colleagues look, they will find that there  are millions of Americans looking for  jobs. They will find that the real unemployment level is around 7.4 million instead of the 5.6 percent that they are  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:07 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A10MR7.014 H10PT1 ",2004
254,33,2004-03-10,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 339, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act and in  strong opposition to the amendment  offered by the gentleman  from New  Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).  The  food service  industry employs  some 11.7 million people, making it the  Nation’s  largest employer outside of  the government. However, this vital industry has recently come under attack  by waves of lawsuits arguing it should  be  liable  for  the misuse  or  overconsumption of its legal products by  others.  Frivolous lawsuits require businesses  to devote crucial resources to litigate  unmerited claims. In order to help ensure that America continues to be an  advantageous place to do business, and  to help create and maintain American  jobs, it is important that we not allow  opportunistic trial  lawyers to extort  money from legitimate companies.  Simply put, businesses in the food industry should not be held responsible  for the bad eating habits of consumers.  The people of America agree. According to a recent poll, approximately 89  percent of Americans oppose holding  the fast-food industry legally responsible for the diet-related health problems of people who eat fast food on a  regular basis.  H.R. 339 will help prevent frivolous  lawsuits against  the  foods  industry  while preserving State and Federal  laws. Specifically, the bill would prevent frivolous lawsuits that claim that  the consumption of lawful food products cause injuries resulting from obesity or weight gain.  While the bill would prohibit frivolous lawsuits, it would protect legitimate ones. For example, the bill would  not protect businesses that knowingly  or willfully violate a State or Federal  statute when the violation is a proximate cause of an injury. In addition,  the bill would not protect those that  violate State or Federal food labeling  laws or those that offer adulterated  food products.  H.R. 339 is a commonsense bill that  will protect legitimate businesses from  frivolous  lawsuits.  I  urge my  colleagues to support this important legislation. But the amendment offered by  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  ANDREWS) runs the risk, if it is passed,  of gutting this legislation.  The reasons set  forth by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), who has done an outstanding  job bringing this  legislation to this  point, are all valid reasons for opposing  this amendment; but in addition there  are more. There is absolutely no reason  why we have to draw a distinction between two different types of perfectly  legitimate products  that  the appropriate regulatory agencies have found  to have no ill effect upon consumers.  There would be no difference whether  it was a natural product or whether it  was one that had been changed through  hybridization and all the other ways  that we have improved food through  the decades, in fact through the centuries,  or  through  biotech-enhanced  foods either.  And so for that reason, I strongly oppose this. If the amendment were to  pass, it is a back-door way to try to  impose  labeling  in this country. We  have opposed this for a long time because there is no distinction between  foods that contain biotech crops and  those that do not. And the issue is very  clear that if you will require it, virtually every product produced in this  country made with  corn,  virtually  every product made  in this country  using soy beans, virtually every product grown  in this country with any  kind of livestock that have been enhanced, and virtually any kind of product that may be developed in the future, there would become a disincentive to produce these improved products, as the gentleman from California  (Mr. DOOLEY) just correctly noted.  This is a huge problem. It would effectively gut this  important  legislation. H.R. 339 generally prohibits obesity  or  weight-gain-related  claims  against  the  foods  industry.  This  amendment would require manufacturers to label genetically engineered material before being afforded the protections of the underlying bill. The irony  is that, as the gentleman from California (Mr. DOOLEY) noted, the opportunity exists with genetically modified  food to improve the problem for people  who have obesity, not to make the  problem worse.  So  I do not understand how  this  amendment relates to H.R. 339. Biotech  crops do not lead to obesity. In fact,  biotech research may lead to food products that help combat the obesity problem in America and nutrition problems  in the developing world.  Farmers have been growing hybrid  and other genetically engineered crops  safely for decades. Biotechnology is as  safe as conventionally bred crops, according to numerous studies by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and other  scientific bodies.  Furthermore,  before  biotech  foods  can be sold to consumers, their safety  is reviewed by three government agencies:  the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection  Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration.  The  Andrews  amendment  runs  counter to long-standing U.S. Government  food  labels policy which preserves food labels for help safety and  nutritional information. This amendment is just another ill considered attempt to discourage consumption of  biotech foods, which every American,  every American consumes on a daily  basis and  encourages  frivolous  lawsuits.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore  (Mr.  OSE). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).

257,33,2004-03-10,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Chairman, I think  there  is a bipartisan consensus here  today that educated and informed consumers regarding what is in their food  should not have a claim relating to  obesity and that we would all attempt  to write a law that will effectuate that  goal.

259,40,2004-03-10,Mr. GOODLATTE., I yield to the gentleman from New York.  ,2004
260,40,2004-03-10,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, it  seems to me the gentleman would have  it both ways. First the claim is that  my amendment is redundant, the bill  already does what it does. Now the gentleman is saying that it guts the bill.  How can it be redundant and gut the  bill?  ",2004
261,40,2004-03-10,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I never once said  that this is redundant. What I said was  there is language in the bill that protects an individual from being sued, a  business from being sued by an individual, if they ate tainted meat. But  the gentleman’s amendment would prohibit a company from having the protection of this bill if at any time they  ever sold one single downed animal or  bought from a company that had processed one downed animal. That covers  every single circumstance of every single company that is engaged in food  processing in the country.  So obviously the gentleman’s amendment, no matter what his underlying  intent is, and his underlying intent has  nothing to do with obesity, whatever  the gentleman’s underlying intent is,  the effect of his amendment is to kill  this bill because it would remove protection that is desired by 89 percent of  the American people that we are coming  forward with to do today  from  every single company in the food process because it does not require a willful  and malicious intent; it just says all  you had to do was distribute it once in  the entire history of your company  from this day forward, and you lose  that protection under the law.  This is a foolish, ridiculous amendment, and I urge my colleagues to reject it. The purpose of the legislation  before us is to protect the food industry from having to defend themselves  from frivolous obesity-related lawsuits.  No one has ever argued that downed  animals caused obesity differently than  non-downed animals.  This bill does not in any way relate  to the  issues of  food safety, animal  health  or  animal welfare. Products  that do not meet the standards of our  laws relating to  food safety, animal  health or animal welfare will not be  protected by this legislation.  Mr. Chairman,  the bill before us  today is a very carefully thought out  effort to address the growing problem  of frivolous and costly lawsuits that do  nothing  but  harm  American  consumers. These lawsuits have the consequence of adding unnecessary cost to  the food industry and consumers to the  sole benefit of trial lawyers.  The Ackerman amendment has nothing to do with this issue. It simply creates confusion about who should be afforded protection from obesity-related  lawsuits. Because it is so loosely drafted, so carelessly drafted, not addressing anything to do with malicious or  willful action, but anybody who manufactures or distributes, any restaurant,  any grocery store, any wholesale business, any processor who has had any  downed animal at any time, that business would, for all time, be denied the  protection of this legislation. I urge  my  colleagues  to  oppose  this  outrageous amendment.  ",2004

269,47,2004-03-10,Mr. KELLER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I will ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the JacksonLee amendment dealing with diet pills  on a couple of grounds:  First, the Personal Responsibility in  Food  Consumption  Act  applies  to  weight gain, obesity, or any health  condition that is associated with a person’s weight gain, such as diabetes,  high  cholesterol,  cardiovascular disease. It has nothing to do with weight  loss and nothing to do with diet pills,  and this amendment confusingly implies weight loss can be weight gain,  which does not make sense.  The second part of the amendment,  which is somewhat odd, is the amendment would bizarrely require Members  to vote for a provision that states that  being  fat  is  ‘‘generally  associated’’  with  brain  dysfunction  and  neurological disorders. Specifically, it says,  ‘‘neurological damage or any other  complication which may be generally  associated with a person’s weight gain  or obesity.’’ Not all people who might be overweight are suffering from neurological  problems. I can tell you that it is possible to be both fat and happy. So I do  not understand  the  reason  for  this  amendment.  ",2004

275,47,2004-03-10,Mr. WATT.,"  I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Chairman, I thank the distinguished  ranking member very much for yielding to me. I know we can come to a  meeting of the minds on this.  Mr. Chairman, I want to take my  good friend from Florida somewhat to  task because it is inaccurate what he  has just represented to this body. It is  totally inaccurate. These supplements  claim to help prevent weight gain or  they claim to help or to prevent obesity. This legislation does apply. Clear  and simply, it does apply.  What is going to happen is that we  are hiding the ball. This  legislation  will pass and thousands will be thrown  out of the courthouse. I have already  cited for my colleagues that there have  been  18,000  adverse  reactions  from  ephedra, with 155 deaths.  Let me advise how this bill impacts  the problem that I am citing by way of  my amendment and why it needs to be  fixed. First of all, section 3(a) of the  bill bans qualified civil liability action.  That already goes to those who have  had an adverse reaction or those who  are dead and their family members are  trying to go into court. Section 4(5) of  the bill defines qualified civil liability  actions as actions involving a qualified  product. Section 4(4) of the bill defines  a qualified product as a food under the  Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section  32(f)(f) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic  Act says a dietary supplement shall be  deemed to be a food within the meaning of this chapter.  This bill is a direct correlation to the  Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and  ephedra, as a dietary supplement, is,  therefore, a food, with 18,000 adverse  reactions  and  155  deaths. You  can  equate it to those who are allergic to  dairy products, for example.  Again, these attempts are not to condemn the food industry globally. We all  enjoy and need the nutrients produced  by the agricultural industry as well as  the food industry, the processing food  industry, the  fast-food  industry that  produces meals that sometimes may be  the only meals that people have. But  what we are saying, Mr. Chairman, and  what we are saying to this body, you  cannot hide the ball.  We hope that this is not a sinister intent, a back-door intent to have tort  reform and  to close  the courthouse  door. If it is not, you cannot argue with  the fact that this is a food supplement  covered by this bill. And I would say to  my colleagues, when they do not want  to accept any amendment, we may  have a disagreement on this bill; but,  frankly, we do not have a disagreement  on the fact that people’s rights may be  denied. They think it is the food industry; I think it is individuals.  If my colleague thinks that the bill  does not apply to dietary supplements,  then why  does he not  accept  the  amendment? It does no harm anyhow.  The language of the bill is ambiguous  at best, dangerous at worst. But more  importantly, I have just run through  an explanation why food supplements  are  included. So I do not think we  should  take  a  chance.  I  think we  should protect the American public and  provide support for this amendment so  in fact we have the opportunity to clarify it.  I do not see where this bill clarifies a  distinction between food and the food  supplement and the fact as to whether  or not someone would make a claim  that would subject them to a lawsuit. I  am concerned, and I would think my  colleagues should be concerned. This  does not have to be time spent in frivolity. It can be a serious attempt at  legislation. All we have to do is balance it.  If there  is some substance to this  idea that  fast-food chains are being  subjected  unmercifully  to  lawsuits,  then just imagine those without the  kinds of  resources  that you might  think a business would have and individually are  sued by  this  industry.  That is unfair. And those who are now  in the process of suing because they  have actually been harmed.  The very language of this bill that I  think is overreaching anyhow, which is  clearly  retroactive,  to me,  suggests  that we have a real problem. In fact, I  would ask the question whether this  bill will withstand any sort of court review; and if I can stretch it, whether it  will withstand any kind of constitutional muster.

284,54,2004-03-10,Mr. LEACH.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  House Concurrent Resolution  15,  a  measure commending India on its Republic Day and  reiterating congressional support for continued strong relations between India and the United  States.  This  thoughtful concurrent  resolution was introduced by the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), the  distinguished head of the Indian Caucus, and our colleague on the Committee on International Relations, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY). It was considered and adopted  without amendment by the committee  on February 25.  As Members are aware,  in  recent  years  the  relationship  between  the  United States and India has been fundamentally transformed in exceptionally positive ways. Thankfully,  the  time has  long since passed when  it  could be said that India and America  are democracies estranged. Instead, in  recognition both of the end of the Cold  War and India’s embrace of market economics, our two great countries have  not only rediscovered each other but  developed  a  remarkable  degree  of  amity and rapport.  The United States/India political relationship is rapidly maturing. We are  having regular meetings at the highest  levels of government. At the summit in  Washington in November 2001, President  Bush  and  Prime  Minister  Vajpayee articulated their vision of the  relationship  our  countries  should  enjoy. The prime minister insightfully  described it as a natural partnership.  Our  deepening  government-to-government relationship is complemented  by a rich mosaic of expanding peopleto-people ties. In many ways, the more  than 2 million Indian Americans in the  United States have become a  living  bridge between our two great democracies, bringing together our two peoples, as well as greatly enlarging the  United States’ understanding of India  and Indian understanding of the United  States.  In short, this timely resolution appropriately honors the world’s largest  democracy, a country with which the  United States is enjoying increasingly  warm  ties and a people  for whom  Americans have a great and enduring  affection.  I urge the adoption of this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2004

This important resolution commends  India on  its celebration of Republic  Day which occurs on January 26. While  we may be a few weeks late in commemorating this important event, our  enthusiasm for reaffirming the strong  and  unbreakable  ties  between  the  United States and India remain strong.

286,61,2004-03-10,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," I join my colleagues  in supporting H. Res. 540, which expresses  the condolences and deepest sympathies of  the House of Representatives for the untimely  death  of  Macedonian  President  Boris  Trajkovaski.  As we know, President Trajkovski died in a  February  26  plane  crash  in  BosniaHerzegovina, where he was planning to participate in a conference before traveling to Ireland to present his country’s formal application  to join the European Union.  Boris Trajkovski had been serving as President since 1999. He reached across ethnic divides to hold his country together during the  ethnic  turmoil and conflict which erupted  in  Macedonia in 2001. He also represented Macedonia well  in working with  the  international  community, both on regional  issues and on  making Macedonia’s case for integration into  European and Euro-Atlantic institutions.  Macedonia  is a country of concern  to  the  Helsinki Commission, which  I chair. As  they  have had  to develop democratic  institutions  over the last 15 years, Macedonia also had to  assert  independent statehood as Yugoslavia  disintegrated and deal with the economic disruption caused by  that disintegration. Macedonia had to bear a refugee burden caused  by associated conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo,  and be a part of  the enforcement of  international sanctions against Milosevic’s Servia.  Macedonia has had  to work out differences  with neighboring states on sensitive, national  issues which run deep in Balkan history, at the  same  time  to overcome divisions within  its  own, ethnically diverse population. And, like so  many of the countries in southeastern Europe,  Macedonia must contend with organized crime  and corruption, including trafficking in persons,  which threaten its further democratic and economic development.  It  is my hope, Madam Speaker,  that  the  same strength and determination upon which  the people of Macedonia have relied  in  the  face of  these  challenges, will  serve  them  again in the face of this latest tragedy. With  the passage of  this  resolution,  the United  States Congress can show  its support  for  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:59 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A10MR7.059 H10PT1 ",2004

289,68,2004-03-10,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of rural veterans and  in support of H.R. 2379, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act of 2003. I  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) for his  leadership on this issue.  No veteran should ever have reason  to doubt America’s gratitude for his or  her service to the Nation and to the  cause of freedom. America’s veterans  deserve nothing less than our highest  gratitude, our deepest respect, and our  strongest support. Veterans from rural  areas, like my district, deserve nothing  less than their comrades living in more  populated areas.  Michigan’s First Congressional District has the highest population in any  congressional  district  in Michigan.  There are 65,000 veterans in my district, one-fifth of all the veterans in  the State of Michigan. b2030  They  live over a huge area. The  Upper Peninsula alone spans 450 miles  from east to west. While the VA provides wonderful care in northern Michigan, it is far too hard for veterans to  access health care. Recently, a Vietnam veteran from the Upper Peninsula  had to go to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for  the  treatment  that he needed. Milwaukee is a long way from home, so  our veterans go as  far as the  Iron  Mountain VA Medical Center, and they  spend the night there. The next day  they are put on a bus and they are  shipped down to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  And that is repeated once their treatment is done, whether it is 1, 2 or 3  days. They are put back on a bus, they  go back to Iron Mountain, Michigan,  and then they spend the night and go  on home.  It is outrageous that they have to  travel so many miles, in some case 450  miles, just to get treatment. At best  the distance is an inconvenience. At  worst, it puts veterans’ lives at serious  risk. I had another case where a retired  Navy veteran from Sault Ste. Marie  had surgery at the VA Medical Center  in Milwaukee to treat his cancer. After  surgery, he was transported via van all  of the way back to Sault Ste. Marie,  379 miles away. The next morning, his  spouse had to take him to the emergency room in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and the emergency room could not  help him. The nearest VA medical center in Iron Mountain could not help  him either, so he had once again to be  shipped by ambulance 379 miles down  to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot have veterans being  shipped back and  forth  across state lines. It is dangerous, and  it is just not right. These two constituents  represent  the  challenges  faced  every day by rural veterans across this  country. Congress needs to act to address the specific needs of rural veterans. That is why I am a cosponsor of  H.R. 2379, the Rural Veterans Access to  Care Act of 2003. The legislation would  allow veterans to enroll in an option to  care  to  closer  seek  routine health  home.  H.R. 2379 sets aside 5 percent of each  VA region’s medical care allocation to  be used for routine medical care for  highly rural or geographically remote  veterans. The legislation would allow  rural veterans to be closer to their  health care providers, rather than traveling hundreds of miles for an appointment at the VA, which could be especially  dangerous  during  inclement  weather.  In Michigan, I will also continue to  work to open a community-based outpatient  clinic  in Gladstone. Over  2  years ago, the VA announced to open  the CBOC, as we call them, in Gladstone. Yet  during  every  successive  round of CBOC openings across  the  country, somehow our region just cannot seem to get Gladstone funded. It is  estimated a Gladstone CBOC would  provide much needed basic health care  to our veterans, in fact, to approximately 750 veterans alone in its first  year of operation. This facility is critical towards keeping our promise to  those who serve our country so well.  I  think  today, Americans have a  deeper understanding of the sacrifices  of our military personnel than at any  time in recent history. Our commitment to veterans must be more than  just waving the American flag in times  of armed conflict and recognizing them  on national holidays. We owe it to our  veterans to do more. We must be prepared to take their battle-borne scars  of war and military service throughout  their  lifetime, and make  sure  they  have the quality of service they need.  Today I was visited by a couple from  Chassel, Michigan,  representing  the  VFW. They handed me the VFW’s priorities for the coming year. We can see  here the VFW priority goals for 2004. It  says veterans health  care now, we  earned it. If you look at it, it says the  number one priority of veterans  is  health care. They say underfunding of  the VA budget, 6-month waits to see a  doctor, denial of care to category 8 veterans, little or no long-term care, little  or no mental health care, and millions  of fed-up veterans.  Well, those of us who represent rural  areas, and no matter where veterans  are, we believe they should be taken  care of. There are special challenges  for rural veterans, and we stand here  tonight to urge this Congress to pass  H.R. 2379 to take care of all of our veterans, but especially those of us who  have veterans who live in our rural districts. f  CARBON DIOXIDE CONTRIBUTES  TO CLIMATE CHANGE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BURGESS).

297,89,2004-03-10,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator  from Washington  State. I enthusiastically rise in support  of her amendment to  fully  fund No  Child Left Behind.  This is the 21st century. In our own  country, we have to make sure we are  from  the  safer, that we have a stronger, more  competitive economy. The way we are  going to be safer and stronger is if we  get smarter. By ‘‘smarter,’’ I mean develop a  21st  century workforce.  In  order to do that, we need to make sure  our  elementary, middle,  and  high  schools are the best they can be.  This is why I support full funding of  No Child Left Behind. We need to focus  on achievement. We need to focus on  accountability. But while we are looking to hold our public schools accountable, we need to hold ourselves accountable  in order to bring the resources to our public schools.  Requirements without resources are  an unfunded Federal mandate. If we  want to have a smarter workforce, we  need to get behind our public schools.  The Murray amendment really takes  us a long way in making sure we have  smaller  class  sizes,  better  trained  teachers, and all the other resources  that go into that.  College is also an important part of  being smarter. I am deeply troubled  that access to college, which has been  one part of the American dream, could  now become part of the American financial nightmare. I will be offering an  amendment later on to help families  who want to send their children to college: a simple, straightforward $4,000  tuition tax credit for every year of college.  Our  middle-class  families  are  stressed and stretched. Families in my  own State of Maryland are worried.  They are worried about jobs. They are  worried about losing their health care,  with costs ballooning. They are worried about holding down more than one  job to make ends meet. They race from  carpools to work and afterschool activities and back again. But most of  all, they want to know can they count  on their public schools, which is what  Senator MURRAY is defending. They  want to know will their children be  able to go to college.  I believe the United States of America should provide an opportunity ladder and we need to make sure one of  the rungs in that ladder is access. That  is why I believe a $4,000 tuition tax  credit will go a long way toward giving  help to those who practice self-help— the families who are working and saving to send their children to college,  and young people who are working and  saving to send themselves to college.  Tuition is on the rise at colleges. At  my own University of Maryland, there  has been a 30-percent increase over the  last  2 years. Tuition  for Baltimore  Community College rose by $300 in 1  year. The average cost of a 4-year public college is about $10,500. If you add  the fees and everything, at University  of Maryland it is about $14,000. Those  are not numbers. Those are real costs  to real families.  Financial aid, though, is not keeping  up with the rising costs. Today, Pell  grants only cover 40 percent of the average costs at 4-year public colleges.  Twenty years ago, it covered 80 percent  of the costs.  VerDate jul 14 2003  00:15 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.013 S10PT1 ",2004

The  question of how much money the Federal Government  should  provide  to  local school districts to assist in meeting the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act was something we discussed  extensively when the bill was being  written. Many of us urged that those  figures be higher than they wound up  being, but the authorizing legislation  contains figures which we think the  Congress should honor and should step  up to and fund. That is exactly what  this amendment would do. I congratulate my colleagues, Senator MURRAY  and Senator KENNEDY, for putting this  amendment forward.

306,110,2004-03-10,Mr. GRASSLEY.," I thank the Chair  and  I thank the Senator  from New  Hampshire for his great leadership in  dealing with education.  I spoke about the necessity of the Finance Committee having the freedom  to use revenue we can raise by closing  these tax loopholes, and the necessity  of getting a bipartisan bill out of committee to do it. I think the Senator  from North Dakota spoke very well  about some of the problems we have  with corporations and schemers and  scammers using the Tax Code to avoid  taxation, by ridiculous things like leasing a subway for a city in the United  States, where there is no risk or economic substance to the process. We  want to close those loopholes.  I thought I ought to bring to the attention of the Senate one of the bipartisan bills out of committee that was  using some of those loophole closings.  They definitely have an impact upon  some major industries and jobs in this  country where they are going to be  hurt, because the World Trade Organization has ruled contrary to our trade  agreements, the foreign sales corporation, and the extraterritorial income  provisions we have had to make to  make our business competitive with  European business. Since that is ruled  out, a lot of jobs in major corporations—Microsoft and Boeing, to name a  couple—are going to be hurt and be uncompetitive because of that.  We are taking some of the loophole  closing money that is available to offset the revenue, to reduce corporate  tax from 35 down to 32, so our businesses can be competitive. We can save  jobs at Microsoft and Boeing which  would otherwise be uncompetitive as a  result of the foreign World Trade Organization ruling.  I don’t want  the Senate Finance  Committee’s hands to be tied by a  scheme that thinks this money can be  used four or five times and can be spent  on domestic programs, when we have  to have this money to offset very important tax provisions we want to get  passed. Saving jobs through this JOBS  bill that was before the Senate last  week, and will be up again in 2 weeks,  is an ideal place to use that revenue.  I yield the floor. ",2004

310,110,2004-03-10,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, let me  just say the amendment of the Senator  from Washington does nothing to raise  taxes on middle-class  taxpayers, on  wealthy  taxpayers, on anybody but  people who are engaged in tax scams  and tax dodges, because her proposal is  to close tax loopholes to the tune of $17  billion.  As we look in the budget, there is a  relatively modest amount of money  being raised to close tax loopholes. We  know there are tens of billions of dollars, according to the administration,  in potential tax loopholes that could be  closed.  In addition, let me say to my colleagues I met with the revenue commissioner 2 weeks ago, who tells me  the  tax gap—the difference between  what is owed and what is being paid— was $255 billion for 2001 alone. Let me  repeat  that. The  tax  gap—the  difference between what is owed and what  is being paid—is $255 billion for 2001  alone. There is plenty of money to be  raised in tax loophole closings and the  end of tax scams and the end of the tax  gap to fully fund the amendment of the  Senator from Washington and the middle-class tax relief all of us want to see  continue.

312,110,2004-03-10,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President,  I  know we are going to have a vote in a  few minutes.  I will wrap up a  few  things. There has been a lot of stuff  strewn across the floor about this. We  need to remember what this amendment is all about. It is about keeping a  commitment all of us made when we  voted to pass No Child Left Behind. We told our schools, essentially our  children, our communities, our families across this Nation that we were  going to put in place accountability;  that we wanted our students to learn,  we wanted them to achieve, and we  wanted them to be able to go on and  get the skills they needed to be out in  the job market.  The Senator from Iowa talked about  Microsoft and Boeing and making sure  we can be competitive. The best thing  for Microsoft and Boeing to be competitive is to have an educated workforce of young people who have the  skills they need to come in and do the  kinds of jobs to be competitive in an  international marketplace.  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we said we were going to put  those standards out there, but that was  a two-pronged promise, and the other  promise was to fully fund No Child Left  Behind.  I have been amazed, sitting on the  floor all morning listening to the other  side say: We never intended to fully  fund No Child Left Behind.  I  am  shocked. I thought during the debate  we had an agreement that we would  have accountability and that we would  have  funding. Now  to come back  2  years later and say, We never intended  to fully fund this act, what kind of  promise is that to our children? We are  going to make you take tests and meet  standards, and every year we are going  to increase those standards and we expect you to live up to it. But here in  Congress we can get behind some kind  of statement that we never intended to  fully fund it? That doesn’t fly in my  home.  I think it is imperative that we face  the American people and tell them that  when we in the Senate make commitments, we mean it. When we make a  promise to  fund education, to make  sure our students have the skills they  need, and they can meet those accountability requirements, we keep it. That  is what this amendment is about. It is  as simple and as clear as that.  I heard those on the other side argue  that this is not a real amendment.

335,117,2004-03-10,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, for many  years, I have been growing increasingly  concerned about the Senate as a forum  for debate. Senators at every turn seem  bent upon undermining this institution  and the vision of our constitutional  framers embodied in this upper body of  the Congress.  The Senate is the only forum in our  Government where the perfection of  laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be hammered  out on the anvil of lengthy debate. It  may be slow; it may be unwieldy; it  may be frustrating to some; but it is  the  best means  to  achieving  compromise, to ensuring an informed citizenry, to protecting the rights of the  minority. To shut out the minority by  limiting the right to debate is to needlessly and detrimentally  infuse partisanship into the legislative process.  That is exactly what we are seeing in  this budget resolution.  Included  in the Budget chairman’s  resolution are reconciliation  instructions to the Finance Committee to report $81 billion in tax cuts to extend  the child credit, marriage penalty, and  10-percent bracket expansion that are  scheduled to expire this year. If misused, there is no procedural mechanism  in the Senate more contemptuous of  debate than the budget reconciliation  process, and it is being misused. It is a  process that has morphed into an annual exercise where the majority party  takes advantage of the limitations on  amendment and debate allowed by the  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:37 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.083 S10PT1 ",2004
336,124,2004-03-10,The PRESIDING OFFICER., That is  correct.  ,2004
337,124,2004-03-10,Mr. CONRAD.," I do not want to take  action without consulting the other  side, and the chairman is not in the  Chamber at the moment. So I will not  make a request at this point. Maybe if  we can ask the floor staff to check if  we want to be charging time to the  amendment on an equal basis. I asked  that question because we have tried to  carefully calibrate this so we would  have a voting window starting at 6  o’clock. Maybe if people can check, and  while that is being done, I will add a  few thoughts on this question.  I agree with Senator WARNER we  ought to increase the defense allocation to the request of the Commander  in Chief when our troops are engaged in  combat. I think that should be done.  I also believe we ought to pay for it.  As I understand it, under Senator WARNER’s amendment, the increase will be  made to increase the budget allocation  to  the  request by  the President—I  agree with that—but it will not be paid  for. With that I do not agree. When presented with a choice, I will vote to increase the spending to the request by  the Commander in Chief because I do  not think it is appropriate policy not  to fully fund the Commander in Chief’s  request when our troops are engaged in  combat half a world away. Our troops  right now are engaged in direct combat  in Iraq and Afghanistan and, of course,  in addition to that, we are engaged  globally  in the war on terror. That  does not mean we should not pay for  these additional expenditures. Already  we see record budget deficits.  We see in this budget resolution the  debt of the country being increased by  $2.86 trillion over the next 5 years.  That is a stunning amount of money.  The assertion by some that the deficit  is being reduced really pales in consideration and in comparison to what is  happening to the debt.  The increases in the debt under this  budget  are  simply  staggering—$2.86  trillion over the next 5 years. That is  before the baby boomers retire, that is  before the full cost of the President’s  tax cuts explode because they increase  geometrically right beyond the budget  window.  I would hope we would increase what  is in the budget for our national defense to the amount requested by the  President, but we do it in a way that is  paid  for. I think that would be the  right approach. Unfortunately, Senator  WARNER’s amendment has half of that  formula. He will have the increase in  funding but will not have the appropriate offsets.  We will have a vote later on the question of paying for this increase. I hope  my colleagues are on notice on what  this amendment will involve, and hopefully we will be on this amendment  soon.  I will withhold my request if the Senator from Missouri wants to take some  time. Can we go on to the amendment  then? The Senator from Missouri will  VENS,  speak with the understanding that the  time will, at a later moment, be taken  off the time of the amendment so we  can try and stay on schedule.  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague. ",2004
338,124,2004-03-10,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Missouri.  ,2004
339,124,2004-03-10,Mr. TALENT.," Mr. President, I thank  my friend from North Dakota for accommodating me and allowing me to  speak  for a  few minutes about  the  amendment we all know is going to be  offered in a few minutes by our friend  and colleague, Mr. WARNER from Virginia.  I do thank and congratulate Chairman WARNERand also Chairman STEnot  just  for  producing  this  amendment I think is so important,  but also for their work over the years  in  sustaining America  and keeping  faith with the men and women who  keep faith with us every day and serve  us on the front lines and on the back  lines and throughout the world to keep  our country safe.  I want to suggest to the Senate there  is no more serious amendment we will  consider in this debate on the budget  than the one Senator WARNER is about  to offer.  America  is deeply engaged  in  the  world in all respects, and it should be,  it needs to be. It is a difficult task, but  it is one we bear every day as a nation  in a lot of different ways.  Yet despite all our other efforts, despite our diplomatic efforts, despite  our participation in international organizations, despite  the  coalitions we  have built around the world, despite  our  foreign aid, despite our  exhortations based on our philosophy, despite the power of our ideas, as important as all of that is, America’s security and the security of our allies and  our friends around the world depends  and continues to depend on the reality  and  the perception of our military  power.  That  is what  is at  stake  in  this  amendment  today. The President of  the United States has submitted a defense budget which states a requirement of $421 billion for the national defense. In my judgment, that is quite  probably too low. I have argued for 10  years, first in the House and now in the  Senate, that we are not adequately  funding our defense establishment.  I simply offer very briefly as evidence of that the fact the Joint Chiefs  of Staff recently submitted, in response  to a question from Congressman IKE  SKELTON, my old and dear friend from  the other body, about what their unfunded  requirements were.  In other  words, what are  their  requirements  they were not able to get  into the  President’s budget.  They  submitted  $12 billion  in unfunded requirements, and that is just  their top priorities: $6 billion for the  Army;  $2.5 billion,  roughly,  for  the  Navy; $2.5 billion for the Air Force. I  think it is more than that, based on my  years of experience. I believe we could  add $15 billion to $20 billion to the  budget for procurement alone without  overfunding America’s military. I will  explain in a minute why we are in this  position.  The Army needs to be bigger. I supported an amendment that was offered  by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr.  REED, last year to increase the size of  the Army. I think it needs to be another 30,000 to 40,000 men and women. I  am pleased to say the administration is  moving in that direction now, at least  on a temporary basis, but that requirement was not included in the President’s budget. Half of military housing  is inadequate. That was not provided  for in the President’s budget. There are  other quality-of-life needs we would  like to meet.  Many of us here would like to resolve  the issue of concurrent receipt, for example, so we can allow our military retirees who also have a military disability pension to keep both their retirement they earned and the disability  benefits they deserve. That is not included in the budget. I could go on on  behalf of my belief that the $421 billion  the President has asked for is probably  too low.  Now, I am sure it will be said by  some in the debate on this amendment  that the President’s budget increases  defense from last year by 7 percent and  that is too great. That is above the  rate of inflation.  Our spending on defense as a percentage of gross domestic product is less  than it was prior to World War II. We  spent 47 percent of our discretionary  funds on defense in 2002 compared to 60  percent in 1990, and we are at war. It is  time for us to get as serious as the men  and women in America’s military are  about winning this war.  I went into the Congress in 1993. It  was just after the outgoing first Bush  administration had, in response to the  cold war, cut the size of America’s  military  establishment  by  about  a  quarter to establish what they called  the Bush base force, which, by the way,  is probably about what we need today,  in my judgment.  The incoming Clinton administration  then cut the size of the force an additional 25 percent, to about a third, depending on which branch of the service  we are  talking about.  I argued all  throughout the 1990s that we were not  funding even that undersized force adequately.  All throughout those years, we were  tacitly engaging in the assumption in  this Congress that there was not any  real threat to the United States; that  with the end of the cold war in some  sense history had ended as well.

341,131,2004-03-10,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I appreciate not only the comments of the  Senator from Oklahoma but his leadership on the Budget Committee. I enjoy  very much serving with him on the  committee. I also appreciate the sort  of change of tone from the opposition  on  this amendment. Everything we  have heard about this amendment recently is how we need to have a weaker  rule than the pay-go rule. Somehow we  have to justify these exceptions that  were put in the Budget Committee resolution. Finally the chairman is talking about what we really should be  talking about, that we need a strong  rule.  What he has done is lay out some  things our pay-go doesn’t do. That is  true. There may be some additional  things we should do in this area. But  what I am proposing, with the cosponsors, is let’s at least go back to the  rules we know worked, the rules that  brought this country a balanced budget  in the 1990s. They were proven to work.  That is all this amendment does.  If the Senator from Oklahoma wants  to talk about additional steps, I am all  for  it. Senator GREGG and I,  in the  Budget Committee in the past, tried  for 5-year caps on spending. We were  defeated by a largely party-line vote  except for Senator GREGG. That didn’t  work so we tried a 2-year cap, working  with Senator CONRAD. That was rejected. We tried 1 year. That is one of  the three legs of the stool, the discretionary spending. If the Senator wants  to work with me and Senator GREGG  and others to propose  legislation to  deal with that, I am ready to go. In  fact, Senator GREGG and  I proposed  such a bill.  But the chairman knows very well we  can’t change that on the budget resolution. We have to pass a statutory item  in order to accomplish that. So I am  eager to do it.  Let’s pass this pay-go amendment  and let’s immediately move on to finish the job by passing the kind of statute that will achieve what the Senator  from Oklahoma is talking about.  I can’t allow a complete changing of  the subject because the truth is the  pay-go rules in the proposal before us  are not pay-go. They are pay-go minus.  It is sort of as though you draft up a  budget and after you figure out what  you want, then you draft up the rules  by which you will draft up the budget.  That is the game we are playing here.  We don’t go into the process saying:  Look, we have played by these rules.  They have worked. We say: What do we  need; what tax cuts do we want; what  mandatory spending do we want. And  after that, everything else that hasn’t  gone through the barn door, then we  make the rules apply after that.  I suggest that doesn’t work. I suggest  it is a formula for more fiscal disaster.  I suggest it means next year in the  Budget Committee the same thing is  going to happen. There is going to be a  whole  list  of  tax  cuts  and  other  things—mandatory  spending—people  wanted to get in there. And they will  say: We exempt this, and now we will  make the pay-go rule apply.  That is making a sham out of the  pay-go rules. The ranking member, for  whom I have enormous admiration on  this subject, hit it right on the head.  The people of this country are beginning  to  realize  it has all happened  again, that they have been taken. We  had rules in place that the American  people were thrilled to see work, leading to a balanced budget and a surplus.  Those rules are no longer there. Those  rules were allowed to expire at a time  when  this  country was  undergoing  enormous anxiety. But they are catching on. They caught on in 1992, and  they sent to Washington people who  would deal with the deficit. They are  catching on again now. The Senator is  right, this vote is  ‘‘the vote’’ about  whether you are for balancing this Nation’s budget or whether you want deficits as far as the eye can see.  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator  from Delaware who has been a terrific  advocate on this issue.  ",2004
342,131,2004-03-10,Mr. CARPER.," I thank my colleague  for yielding. I thank Senator FEINGOLD  and others on our side and the other  side of the aisle for their work.  This is an important amendment. He  is right. I don’t know whether it is the  most important amendment offered on  this resolution, but it may well be. I  would like to take a couple of minutes  and look back a few years to some of  the things that have been said by folks  in our country and actually outside of  our country. I would like for us to go back to 2001,  the first year George Bush was President. What he said was: We can proceed with tax relief without fear  of budget deficits. We found out he was wrong.  A year or so later, he said: Our budget will run a deficit that will be  small and short term. sorry  I am  again.  In 2003, he said: to  say he was wrong  Our current deficit is not large by historical standards and is manageable. That, too, is wrong.  This year, he is saying to us: The deficit will be cut in half over the next  5 years. Unfortunately, if we look more closely at what is going to happen over the  next 5 years and beyond, the deficit  may be trimmed a little bit, but it is  going to begin to explode when my generation of baby boomers starts to retire in 5 or 6 years.  I want to share with my colleagues  another quotation that occurred several years before these. It was not by  an American but a fellow from Great  Britain, Dennis Healy. In the late 1970s,  he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.  There was  something he called  the  ‘‘theory of holes.’’ The theory of holes  VerDate jul 14 2003  03:35 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.125 S10PT1 ",2004

366,138,2004-03-10,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, let me  just recap briefly so Senators understand my  amendment.  I  explained  where we were before the break in the  action.  I am offering an amendment which  would eliminate the reconciliation instruction to the budget resolution directing  the Finance Committee  to  produce  savings  in mandatory  programs within the Finance Committee’s  jurisdiction. The amendment, as I mentioned earlier, is based on the assumption in the resolution that the committee would cut Medicaid by $11 billion  over  5  years  and  reduce  the  earned-income tax credit outlays by $3  billion.  Some may think the budget calls for  the Finance Committee to produce legislation that saves $3.4 billion over 5  years, since that is the figure in the  reconciliation.  Actually,  the  committee would have to produce savings  of $21.6 billion, and that is basically because the resolution calls for extending  the child tax credit and the marriage  penalty relief, as the President has proposed, and as provided for in the budget  resolution and which I support. I think  the vast majority of the Members here  support it.  As a consequence of all that, the outlays have to be increased $18.2 billion  over 5 years, and that is, again, because the earned-income tax credit is  refundable. So you add it all together  and it actually comes up to $21.6 billion  that has to be cut, not the figure of $3.4  billion contained in the budget resolution.  I might add that I think neither the  earned-income tax credit cuts nor the  Medicaid cuts make a lot of sense. Let  me start with the earned-income tax  credit. That is a feature in the Tax  Code  that  President  Reagan  once  hailed as—and let me give his quote: . . . the best anti-poverty, the best profamily, the best yet creative measure to  come out of Congress. I think he is right. The earned-income tax credit has done a lot to lift  people out of poverty.  President Bush has not proposed any  reductions  in the earned-income tax  credit,  and with  good  reason. The  earned-income tax credit was created  in 1975 as a bipartisan effort to reduce  the tax burden on low-income Americans. It provides a powerful incentive  for people to work. It has played a very  large role in moving poor families from  welfare to work. It has reduced poverty.  Nearly 4.8 million people, including  2.6 million children, are lifted out of  poverty each year because of the EITC.  By all accounts, the earned-income tax  credit has been successful, and it has  been effective.  While the earned-income tax credit  has achieved  its policy aims, and  I  might add with incredible success, a  1999 Treasury audit of EITC returns  shows that noncompliance is a problem. And it is a problem. Noncompliance in the EITC has been a problem. I  believe, however, that noncompliance  on  the  earned-income  tax  credit  is  largely due to errors, not because of  fraud. Both the complexity of the tax  credit and the complex  living situations are responsible for the high error  rate.  Let me give an example. There is an  IRS publication called publication 596.  That is the IRS instructions and forms  for the earned-income tax credit. Guess  what. It is 52 pages long. Can you imagine somebody sitting down at his or her  kitchen table trying to figure out the  earned-income  tax  credit? The  IRS  takes more  pages  to  explain  the  earned-income tax credit than it does  to explain the complicated alternative  minimum tax. Guess how many pages  are in that. Eight. They are eight terrible pages, but there are only eight of  them. The EITC booklet has 52 pages.  Obviously,  it  is  unnecessary  complexity.  Senator GRASSLEYand I fashioned a  series of reforms that were enacted as  part of the 2001 tax cut legislation. The  Treasury expects those changes alone  will reduce earned-income tax credit  overpayments by about  $2 billion a  year. So we are doing something about  it. We all recognize more needs to be  done, and we will all work together to  see that this work gets done.  But the remaining work is administrative; it is not legislative. As this administration  has  indicated,  finding  ways to identify earned-income tax filers who were not compliant, and to  save money by preventing losses to the  Treasury, is primarily an administrative issue, not one that can be achieved  through legislation. One can’t simply  wave a wand and pass a law mandating  a lower error rate. That takes a lot of  administrative work. The  IRS  and  Treasury are working on it now. They  are conducting a major pilot project to  test new procedures which the agency  hopes will reduce overpayments. I hope  the Treasury  reduces overpayments,  and the IRS is also likely to conduct a  second pilot this summer. I and other  Senators want to see whether these  procedures work, while making sure  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:52 Mar 11, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G10MR6.141 S10PT1 ",2004
367,159,2004-03-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, I  welcome this opportunity to call the  attention of the Senate to an impressive article in yesterday’s Wall Street  Journal by Professor Lea Brilmayer of  Yale Law School  on  the  proposed  amendment  to  the Constitution  on  same-sex marriage.  Supporters of the amendment claim  that same-sex marriages in one State  must be recognized in all other States.  That claim is not true. As Professor  Brilmayer  explains,  ‘‘Longstanding  precedent  from around  the  country  holds that a state need not recognize a  marriage entered into in another state  with different marriage laws if those  laws are contrary to strongly held public policy.’’ States have broad discretion in deciding to what extent they  will defer to other states when dealing  with  sensitive questions about marriage and raising families.  There is no need to amend the Constitution on this issue. States across  the country are clearly dealing with  the issue and doing so effectively, according to the wishes of the citizens in  each of the 50 States. If it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is  necessary not to amend it.  Professor  Brilmayer  testified  on  these constitutional issues at our Judiciary Subcommittee hearing last week,  and I ask unanimous consent that her  article in the Wall Street Journal be  printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 9, 2004]  FULLFAITHANDCREDIT  (By Lea Brilmayer)  Last Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate’s  ‘‘Subcommittee on the Constitution,  Civil Rights and Property Rights’’ was billed  as the occasion for a serious discussion on  the need for a constitutional amendment to  limit the interstate effects of Goodridge, the  Massachusetts court decision recognizing a  state constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Why else would the hearing’s organizers invite me, a professor with no particular published opinion on gay rights but  dozens of technical publications on  interstate jurisdiction? Prepared to do battle over  the correct interpretation of the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause, I found  myself  instead  in the middle of a debate  about whether marriage is a good thing, and  who really loves America’s kids the most— Republicans or Democrats.  Like many political debates, the discussion was framed in absolutist terms. Conservatives say that without a constitutional  amendment, Goodridge goes national. Gays  will travel to Massachusetts to get married  and then their home states will be forced  (under the Full Faith and Credit Clause) to  recognize their marriages. Traditional marriage (apparently a frailer institution than  I’d realized) will be fatally undermined unless we act now to prevent the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from imposing  its will upon the whole nation. Either amend  the Constitution to adopt a national, and  traditional, definition of marriage (they say)  or there will soon be gay and lesbian married  couples living in your own neighborhood. Either it’s their nationwide standard—anyone  can marry—or it’s ours.  The fly in the ointment was that nobody  bothered to check whether the Full Faith  and Credit Clause had actually ever been  read to require one state to recognize another  state’s marriages.  It hasn’t. Longstanding precedent from around the country  holds that a state need not recognize a marriage entered into in another state with different marriage laws if those laws are contrary to strongly held local public policy.  The ‘‘public policy doctrine,’’ almost as old  as this country’s legal system, has been applied  to  foreign marriages between  first  cousins, persons too recently divorced, persons of different races, and persons under the  age of consent. The granting of a marriage  license has always been treated differently  than a court award, which is indeed entitled  to full interstate recognition. Court judgments are entitled to full faith and credit  but historically very little interstate recognition has been given to licenses.  From a technical legal point of view, the  debate at last week’s hearing was entirely  unnecessary. But inciting a divisive and diversionary debate over whether America’s  children will only thrive in traditional marriages (on the one hand) or whether people  who oppose gay marriage are bigots (on the  other) was probably a central objective in  certain quarters. Social conservatives,  in  particular, have a vested interest in overstating the  ‘‘domino effect’’ of Goodridge.  This is particularly true in an election year.  Only an ivory tower academic carrying a  text full of footnotes would notice anything  odd.  The assumption that there must be a single national definition of marriage—traditional or open-ended—is mistaken and pernicious. It is mistaken because the existing  constitutional framework has long accommodated differing marriage laws. This is an  area where the slogan ‘‘stages rights’’ not  only works relatively well, but also has traditionally been left to do its job. We are familiar with the problems of integrating different marriage laws because for the last 200  years the issue has been left, fairly successfully, to the states. The assumption is pernicious because the winner-takes-all attitude that it engenders now has social conservatives pushing us down the constitutional-amendment path. For those who see  the matter in terms of gay rights, this would  be a tragedy. But it would also be a tragedy  for those who genuinely favor local autonomy, or even those of us who genuinely favor  keeping the constitutional text uncluttered  by unnecessary amendments.  If today’s proponents of a marriage amendment are motivated by the fear of some full  faith and credit chain-reaction set off  in  other states by Massachusetts, they needn’t  be. If they are motivated by the desire to assert political control over what happens inside Massachusetts, they shouldn’t be. In our  200-year constitutional history,  there has  never  yet  been  a  federal  constitutional  amendment designed specifically to reverse a  state’s  interpretation  of  its  own  laws.  Goodridge,  whether  decided  rightly  or  wrongly, was decided according to Massachusetts’ highest court’s view of Massachusetts  law. People in other states have no legitimate interest in forcing Massachusetts to reverse  itself—Massachusetts will  do  that  itself, if and when it wants to—and those  who want to try should certainly not cite the  Full Faith and Credit clause in rationalizing  their attempts.  Unlike most other hotly contested social  issues, the current constitutional marriage  debate actually has a perfectly good technical solution. We should just keep doing  what we’ve been doing for the last 200 years. f  SBA EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION  EXTENSION ACT OF 2004  ",2004

This is a leadership resolution that is simply designed after 1  year of fighting the war on terror, the  chapter in Iraq of the book on the war  on terrorism for 1 year and all the extraordinary success and work that has  happened over there. It is entirely appropriate to commend our troops who  are working so hard and the members  of  the Coalition. That  is  the main  thrust of this resolution.

And it is  entirely appropriate to do that. It is no  mean thing to come up with an interim  constitution in the operational climate  that those folks are operating.

And we are very grateful  that they have got the patience to go  forward with it and the commitment to  do this hard work.  This is a democracy-building exercise  in an area where democracy has had  many false starts and very little success. This is good news. It is entirely  appropriate for us at the end of the  year to celebrate the good news.  There has been some concern, as we  saw last night in the Committee on  Rules, about whether or not we should  be declaring that we are better off  without Saddam. And  the  language  that was used was that the world is  safer without him. We did not say the  world is safe. We are in the middle of a  war on terror. And everybody needs to  know that.  And we need  the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) and all his  good  works  and  everybody’s  good  works in this body to support the war  on terror because the war on terror  will not be won without commitment.  We know how these people work, and  we have to be smart enough to resist  the  temptations,  the wedges  they  drive, the propaganda they put out,  apply our capabilities and get the job  done. It will take all of us.  ",2004

I say to my  good friend that he is an original cosponsor of  the  legislation:  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HYDE), the  gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. DELAY),  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr.  BLUNT), the gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Ms. PRYCE), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GOSS), and the gentleman from  California (Mr. HUNTER).  Now, that said, my good friend had  the privilege that the gentleman from  Pennsylvania  (Mr. MURTHA) and the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. SKELTON) did not have, and that was even to  be original co-sponsors even  if they  were not consulted.  Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a  ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question because I feel this totally closed rule is  just plain wrong. There is not one single opportunity for any Member of the  House to offer an amendment to this  resolution, not even on the motion to  recommit.  Oddly  enough, when  the  current  House Republican leadership was in the  minority, a motion to recommit without instructions was one of the things  they complained most about. Now, here  they are doing the very thing they said  was so wrong and offensive at that  time. Where will the sanctimony end?  The war in Iraq is one of the most serious issues facing our Nation today.  Anything that speaks to this matter on  the  floor of the U.S. House of Representatives should be done, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) said, in a way that allows all responsible viewpoints to be considered.  That is what democracy is all about.  This rule simply gags that process.  Ironic, do you not think, when we are  exporting democracy to Iraq.  Mr. Speaker, this is not about stopping consideration of the underlying  resolution. I am not aware of one single Member of this body who does not  support and praise the incredibly brave  men and women who are in harm’s way  in Iraq. b1200  I believe we can all agree wholeheartedly on supporting our soldiers,  but there are other important matters  that are not addressed in this resolution, issues that many in this House  want to include in this resolution.  Therefore, if the previous question is  defeated, I will offer an amendment to  the rule that will allow the motion to  recommit to contain instructions.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the RECORD immediately prior to the vote on the previous question a description of the motion to recommit that will be offered if  the previous question is defeated and  the rule is amended to allow instructions.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BASS). Is there objection to the request  of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, let me just say that my  friend, the chairman of the Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence,  looked at that resolution and was so  proud of it that he immediately joined  as a cosponsor, as I believe everyone in  this House should.  Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, obviously everyone in this House should be  in support of a resolution which affirms that the United States and the  world have been made safer with the  removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime from power in Iraq; that commends the Iraqi people for their courage in the face of unspeakable oppression and brutality inflicted upon them  by Saddam Hussein’s regime; that commends the Iraqi people on the adoption  of Iraq’s interim constitution and commends the Members of the U.S. Armed  Forces and coalition forces for liberating Iraq; and expresses its gratitude  for their valiant service. That is what  we are doing here  today. Everyone  should be in support of it.

377,20,2004-03-17,Mr. CASE.," Mr. Speaker,  I stand  today  in  grateful support of this resolution, which I am  proud to have cosponsored.  This resolution is about three things. First,  re-acknowledgement of  that  region of our  world in which the present and future of our  Nation and so many others lie: the Pacific and  Asia. Second, recognition of a proud people  and culture whose future lies now not only in  their home  islands, but  in our own country.  Third, responsibility for our actions which, like  the consequences of those actions, will extend  down through the generations.  On  re-acknowledgement, as a product of  the Pacific, I confess to a Pacific-centric view  of our world. But can anyone doubt that our  own future is inextricably tied to that of the Pacific? And as we look to the Pacific, we cannot  overlook  its  island nations, whose strategic  value and loyalty to democratic principles are  unquestioned.  Foremost among these nations is the Republic of  the Marshall  Islands, with a proud  history and culture dating back thousands of  years. We celebrate in this resolution the mutually beneficial relationship we have enjoyed  for more than half a century.  We also celebrate its people, who at home  are striving to build a modern and sustainable  island nation. And the emigration of many to  new lands and new opportunities, especially in  our country, are strengthening communities  beyond their homeland.  My own state has especially benefited, with  a Marshallese  community  of  some  5000  strong poised  for a major breakthrough  into  the mainstream of political, economic and social participation in Hawaii’s affairs.  And, of course, we cannot  forget  that  the  Marshallese and their counterpart Pacific nations  today have  their sons and daughters  serving with our armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and lying grievously wounded defending our joint freedoms in military hospitals.  And  lastly,  this  is a resolution of remembrance, of the dire consequences to a whole  people and their aina, or land, of 66 nuclear  tests, virtually all open air, from 1946 through  1958,  including, 50 years ago, BRAVO,  the  world’s first hydrogen bomb. Few of us, even  today, can imagine the force and devastation  released by just one such device, much less  66.  I have my own recollection, as a boy of just  six, sitting on my grandparents’ porch on the  Island of Kauai, on a dark night, watching the  entire sky  light up  from a single explosion  2,300 miles away. But the Marshallese lived  through it, and they are still living through it,  and will  live  through  it  for generations  to  come.  These stories are being told elsewhere, by  Beverly Keever, in a February 25, 2004 article  in  the  ‘‘Honolulu Weekly,’’ and by  James  Matayoshi, Mayor of Rongselap, in recent remarks on BRAVO day. I append these for the  RECORDand commend them to your attention.  But today, we simply remember what happened and recommit ourselves to remedy that  which must be remedied.  Mr. Speaker, there are lots of people to be  thanked for this resolution. Chair POMBOand  Ranking Member RAHALL,  for  their commitment, Chair HYDEand Ranking Member LANfor bringing  this  to  the  floor, and Chair  and Ranking Member FALEOMAVAEGA  for their advocacy. But mostly, we thank the  people of the Marshall Islands, for their friendship and support. We will not forget. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following articles  for  insertion  into  the RECORD in connection  with H. Con. Res. 364. TOS LEACH SUFFERING, SECRECY, EXILE: BRAVO50 YEARS  LATER  (By Beverly Deepe Keever)  [From Honolulu Weekly, Feb. 25, 2004]  Almira Ainri was 10 years old when she was  catapulted into the atomic age.  In June of 1946, as the U.S. Navy readied  the first atomic bomb in peacetime—just the  fourth in history—Ainri and about 100 other  inhabitants of Rongelap Atoll, in the Marshall Islands, were sent south by ship to Lae  Atoll, where it was thought they would be  safe from the effects of the explosion 100  miles away, at Bikini Atoll.  Eight years later, in 1954, Ainri and other  Rongelapese weren’t as lucky.  Fifty years ago this week, on Bikini Atoll,  the U.S. detonated the Bravo shot, a 15–megaton hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb it dropped on Hiroshima.  The most powerful bomb in U.S. nuclear  history, Bravo had a radioactive cloud that  plumed over  7,000  square miles, an area  about the size of New Jersey. A hundred or  so miles downwind, near-lethal fallout powdered  at  least  236  inhabitants  of  the  Rongelap and Utrik atolls, contaminating  their ancestral homelands. The Bravo-dusted  islanders entered history as unique examples  of the effects of radioactive fallout on humans.  Ainri, who now lives in Honolulu, is one of  118 survivors of the Bravo shot. For her and  other islanders, the bomb’s detonation set  off a chain reaction of events over the last  half century. They became unwitting subjects in secret U.S. research on the effects of  nuclear fallout and ultimately were forced to  leave their idyllic homeland, which remains  uninhabitable to this day due to radioactivity.  Archeological finds on Bikini Atoll suggest  that the first Micronesians likely arrived in  the Marshall Islands between 2,500 and 4,000  years ago. Germany annexed the islands in  1885. Japan captured them  in 1914. Allied  forces captured and occupied them in World  War II; the war’s end left them in U.S. hands.  The U.S. began nuclear testing there the  next year.  The Marshall Islands were declared a Trust  Territory by the United Nations in 1947, with  the U.S. as the administrator, an arrangement that did not end until 1991. The following treatment of the irradiated islanders  raises doubts about the behavior of the U.S.  government:  U.S. officials failed to evacuate Ainri and  other islanders before the Bravo shot and  then delayed their removal for more than 50  hours after the fallout.  On March 7, 1954, six days after the Bravo  shot, Project  4.1,  ‘‘Study of Response of  Human Beings Exposed to Significant Beta  and Gamma Radiation due to Fallout from  High Yield Weapons,’’ established a secret  U.S. medical program to monitor and evaluate islanders exposed to radiation, turning  them  into  experimental  human  subjects  without their consent.  Ainri and other islanders were allowed to  return to their irradiated homeland in 1957.  It was later deemed unsafe for human habitation.  Marshall Islanders were injected with or  fed radioactive tracers without their consent, contrary to medical recommendations  made by U.S. medical officers six weeks after  the Bravo shot that the islanders should receive no more exposure to radioactivity in  their lifetimes.  The research projects arising from Bravo  were begun just seven years after war crimes  tribunals convicted German medical officers  for  their horrific  experiments with  concentration camp inmates during World War  II. Those tribunals  led to the Nuremberg  Code, an international standard for experiments involving human subjects, which stipulated that the voluntary consent of the subject  ‘‘is  absolutely  essential.’’ The U.S.  Atomic  Energy  Commission  established  similar standards, requiring the consent of  human subjects and the expectation that an  experiment would benefit the subject, but  they had little distribution or effect in the  U.S. bureaucracy.  Did U.S. bureaucratic bungling and operational obstacles cause the mistreatment of  the islanders or, as so many islanders and  others say, did U.S. officials make the islanders guinea pigs to study the effects of radioactivity?  LIKENEEDLESOVERMYWHOLEBODY  At about 6 a.m. on March 1, 1954, Almira  Ainri was awakened by the brightness and  noise of an inferno as hot as the core of the  sun. Ainri was 18 then, married, and pregnant with her first child.  The island shook, she recalled. The air was  gray. Snowlike particles fell from the sky.  A day  later, U.S.  soldiers with Geiger  counters  arrived  and  found  people  of  Rongelap weak and vomiting. Fifty hours  and more after Bravo’s detonation, the 236  inhabitants on or near Rongelap and Utrik  atolls were evacuated to the military clinic  at  Kwajalein  Atoll.  There,  they  were  scrubbed every day with special soaps. The  pressure of the water on Ainri’s blistered  skin felt ‘‘like needles over my whole body,’’  she said—‘‘like I was burning.’’  After the blast, Ainri gave birth to a son,  Robert. His thyroid glands were so damaged  that he became dwarfed. The glands were  later removed, consigning him to a lifelong  regimen of medication. Ainri got pregnant  again and gave birth, she said, to ‘‘a bunch of  grapes, that had to be pulled out of me.’’  Twice more Ainri got pregnant, she said, and  gave birth to children who appeared normal  but died several days  later. Another son,  Alex, survived, but again with damaged thyroid glands. Ainri herself has thyroid problems; two new growths recently appeared  there.  The suffering of Ainri and her family is  hardly unique. Within a decade of the Bravo  shot, more than 90 percent of the children  who were under 12 years old at the time of  the  explosion  developed  thyroid  tumors.  Today, Marshall Islanders have one of the  world’s highest rates of abnormalities of the  thyroid, which often result in cases of retardation, cretinism and stunted development.  For these and other conditions that the  U.S. government presumes were caused by  its nuclear weapons testing, the U.S. pays  compensation. Those with leukemia or cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas or bone are awarded $125,000.  Islanders with severe growth retardation due  to thyroid damage get $100,000.  By the end of 2002, a U.S. trust fund had  paid about $79 million to 1,808 islanders, but  because the trust fund could not cover all its  obligations, 46 percent of affected islanders  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:29 Mar 18, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17MR7.019 H17PT1 ",2004
378,27,2004-03-17,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, before  yielding to the gentleman from Florida, let me remind the gentleman from  Wisconsin that national unity and cohesion are not matters of parliamentary procedure. They are at the core of  uniting  the United States  and  the  American people at a time of war.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 11⁄2  minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. WEXLER), a distinguished member  of the committee.  ",2004
379,27,2004-03-17,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Speaker, while I  strongly support the brave American  soldiers risking their lives to defend security and freedom, I rise in opposition  to this politically motivated resolution  because it is a farce and anyone who  says otherwise is too blinded by politics to see the truth. The truth is Iraq  was not an imminent threat to America. There were no chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; and there was  no link between al Qaeda and Saddam  Hussein. The only mushroom cloud resulting from the war in Iraq is that  represented by the Bush administration’s barrage of deception and  lies.  While President Bush considers himself  a war President, he is actually a selfmade President of war. The President  created the pretext for the war in Iraq.  He planned for it before September 11,  and he misused and fabricated intelligence to sell it to the American people. Instead of debating this empty resolution of praise for President Bush,  Congress should investigate the President’s unconscionable misuse of power  and manipulation of the truth.  Despite  this  second declaration of  ‘‘mission accomplished’’  in Iraq, history will tell the true story as it did in  Vietnam. The mission is far from being  accomplished, and President Bush will  be judged harshly for the tragic events  of the past year.  ",2004
380,27,2004-03-17,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased  to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN).  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.  I  thank  the  gentleman from Illinois for yielding me  this time.  Mr. Speaker, as a political refugee  from a brutal, sadistic regime, I know  of the terrible crimes that dictators  commit against their own people. Yet  after talking to survivors of Saddam  Hussein’s regime and speaking with the  teams  who  uncovered  Iraq’s mass  graves, I was left speechless in the face  of such atrocities. The Iraqi dictatorship  indiscriminately  slaughtered  Iraqis but the women were among the  most  vulnerable.  The  notorious  Fedayeen beheaded women in public,  dumping their severed heads at their  families’ doorsteps. According to the  September 2001 report of the United  Nations Special Rapporteur, at  least  130 Iraqi women were beheaded between  June 2000 and April 2001, in just 1 year.  The regime used widespread rape to extract confessions  from detainees and  would intimidate members of the opposition by sending them videotapes of  the rapes of their female relatives. At  times, family members were forced to  watch those tapes.  However, Saddam Hussein’s legacy of  terror knew no boundaries. Even small  children were not spared the butchery  as evident  from  the  tiny  skeletons  found in mass graves throughout Iraq.  In 1998, the evidence of the Iraqi regime’s threatening behavior continued  to mount and we as Members of the  United States Congress  in a unified  manner overwhelmingly approved the  Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, calling for  the regime of Saddam Hussein to be removed from power and replaced with a  democratic government. By 2003 after 6  more years of Saddam’s oppression, the  death toll had reached frightening proportions. The U.S. could not watch idly  and do nothing. As a Nation which  stands  for  freedom,  democracy  and  human rights, we were compelled to  act. Today as a result of the President’s resolve in Iraq and the courageous dedicated service of our troops,  the Iraqi people are free.  As Iraq’s new female minister of Municipalities and Public Works said last  week to us: ‘‘On April 9, 2003, Iraqis  were offered the opportunity to begin  to dream their future.’’ To determine if  going to war in Iraq and liberating the  Iraqi people was the right decision, just  ask Dr. Khuzai, a member of the Iraqi  Governing Council and National Council on Women. After being prisoners in  their own country for 35 years, she told  us: ‘‘For the Iraqi women, the morale  is so high that you can’t understand it  unless you go and see. All the Iraqis  are very grateful to Mr. Bush and to  the U.S. for liberating us from the dictatorship regime. We will be grateful  forever.’’  Today, the United States is helping  Iraqi women  reintegrate  themselves  into Iraqi society and, indeed, the outside world. Toward this end, the administration has embarked on the Iraqi  Women’s Democracy Initiative to train  Iraqi women in the skills and practices  of democratic public life. It has also established the U.S.-Iraqi Women’s Network, helping to mobilize the private  sector.  This is just the beginning. We will  have a better, safer world for the Iraqi  people, especially for the Iraqi women,  and for all. ",2004
381,27,2004-03-17,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MENENDEZ), the distinguished chairman of the  Democratic Caucus and an important  member of the Committee on International Relations.  (Mr. MENENDEZ  asked  and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2004
382,27,2004-03-17,Mr. MENENDEZ.," I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding me this  time.  Mr. Speaker, I hear my colleagues  now talk about human rights and brutality, and there is no question about  that; but there is human rights and  brutality in many parts of the world,  and  that has not  caused American  troops to intervene in those countries.  One year after the U.S.  invasion of  Iraq, it is time to focus on the truth.  Yet this resolution leaves out the administration’s most  important  justification for the war in Iraq, weapons  of mass destruction. This administration systematically misled the American public and Congress into believing  that there were weapons of mass destruction and that we were under an  imminent threat. According to the Carnegie Endowment For  International  Peace recent report, the administration systematically misrepresented the  threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction by presenting the case as  solid instead of expressing the uncertainty that existed in the intelligence  assessments, and making the threat  seem dire rather than minor by misrepresenting the inspector’s findings.  In fact, a report by the minority staff  of the Committee on Government Reform  found the administration made  over 200 misleading public statements  on the Iraqi threat.  The truth is that this administration  will not have  the American people  know what really happened with the  intelligence until after the November  elections, a year from today. Most importantly, this Republican Iraq resolution, crafted with no input from Democrats, makes no mention of the over 565  American men and women who gave  their lives in Iraq to date and over 3,500  others who are wounded.  I  say we  should honor  those who gave  their  lives, not ignore them. This resolution  should  commemorate  that  ultimate  sacrifice.  In the wake of the recent attacks in  Spain, it is shameful that Republicans  are acting as dividers, not uniters. It is  shameful that the Republicans without  input from Democrats on a crucial resolution that could express our collective sentiment as we did after September 11 seek partisan gain out of  what should be a national embrace.

384,34,2004-03-17,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague from Missouri for recognizing that Missouri, too, is the State  of my birth, and I am delighted to be  on the floor today with him because he  has provided wonderful leadership for  our caucus.  Mr. Speaker, I came today to the  floor to shame the Republicans and the  President  for politicizing this tragic  war  in Iraq. God bless our soldiers.  They do not deserve to be made pawns  in political gamesmanship. There are  many Members who love and support  our  soldiers  but  refuse  to  be  blackmailed into supporting this preemptive strike doctrine of this administration and to be used by this President. Just as President Bush  is attempting to use the New York 9/11  scene as a backdrop in his political advertisement, this resolution  is being  used to paint the picture that this  President is a tough leader, fighting  terrorism and winning.  Mr. Speaker, this President  is not  winning. Our country and the world is  not more secure. Tragically, over 564  soldiers have died since the war began  last year, and thousands more have  been injured. The administration has  spent $157 billion so far in this war, and  even the allies who have supported him  are being retaliated against.  If my friends on the opposite side of  the aisle were sincere about gathering  us all together in a resolution to say to  our soldiers thank you for your sacrifices, they would have done what was  asked of them by the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA) today: Pull  this one-sided resolution off the floor,  get Democrats  involved,  let us  join  hands and support our soldiers.  This is the most divisive administration that this country has ever had, polarizing us, putting us at each others’  throats. It is a shame, and I do not  mind saying it on this floor today. You  need to withdraw it.  ",2004

386,34,2004-03-17,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  our great chairman for yielding me the  time. And, Mr. Speaker,  if my colleagues  in  this Chamber have  any  doubt about the necessity of our war  against the sadistic and despotic regime of Saddam Hussein, I urge them  to look at this photo that I took with  Iraqi girls during a congressional trip  that some of my colleagues and I went  on last December.  If my colleagues take a close look at  this  picture,  they will  see  bright,  sunny faces of happy girls who look  like they could live in my district or  any of their districts around this country, but the sad reality is that a little  over a year ago, these young girls were  living under the ugly regime of a murderous dictator who would not hesitate  to take their lives or the lives of their  friends and family. In fact, from 1983 to  1988 Saddam Hussein wiped out 60 villages and murdered more than 30,000  Iraqi citizens with weapons of mass destruction. Human rights organizations  continually  received  reports  from  women who said that rape was routinely used by Iraqi officials as weapons of torture, intimidation, and blackmail.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what  would have happened to these girls if  the United  States  had  not  acted  against  Saddam  Hussein’s  ruthless  Baathist regime, but I do know this  much. Since  the  liberation of  Iraq,  more than 5.5 million children went  back to school this year; 2,300 schools  which  fell  into  disarray  under  Saddam’s regime have been rehabilitated. School  children  have  books,  shoulder bags, notebooks, pencils, papers and desks to use for their studies;  but, most importantly, they are now  living  free  from Saddam’s repressive  regime, and they never have to worry  again about being harmed by their tyrannical government,  thanks  to  the  strong  leadership of President Bush  and the heroic efforts of our men and  women of the armed services.  I cannot say enough about our troops  who risk life and limb every day to  bring freedom to these girls and to the  other people of Iraq. I urge strong support of this resolution endorsing our  troops. ",2004

388,34,2004-03-17,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  the  time, and it is unfortunate that this  resolution has become so political because I think clearly all of us should  have been able to sit down and come up  with a resolution that would be united  and that would send a clear voice to all  of the world how much we support our  troops.  We are going to have 4 hours of debate, and there are so many important  things we should be discussing, like the  fact  that we  failed  to provide our  troops with  critical  protection  and  equipment that they need, from interceptive body armor to anti-jamming  devices, to armored humvees.  Yesterday, I met with Brian Hart,  the father of Private First Class John  Hart who was killed in Iraq last October when the unarmored humvee that  he was patrolling in was ambushed and  sprayed with bullets. Just days before  his death, Pfc. Hart called his father  and told him how unsafe he felt riding  around in humvees that lacked bulletproof shielding or reinforced doors.  The story of John Hart is all too familiar. A couple of months ago, the Defense Department stated that 29 American troops had been killed and 290  wounded on attacks on humvees. Now I  hear they are not even tracking those  numbers anymore, but I do know that  of the 18 soldiers killed in Iraq from  Massachusetts,  6 died  in unarmored  humvees or trucks.  Look at this chart. Almost 80 percent  of the 12,500 humvees deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom  and  Iraqi  Freedom lack reinforced windows and  doors. The  evidence  here  is  overwhelming  that we have not gotten  what our troops need fast enough. b1545  And what bothers me  is that the  Army did not even begin to address  this  shortage  until August  2003,  3  months  after  President  Bush  announced the end of the war in Iraq. The  Secretary of the Army says that they  will get this done by August; but as of  today no new orders have been placed,  leaving our troops, many of them, in  this vulnerable position,  in unarmed  vehicles. August  just  is  not  good  enough. For too long, the Army has dragged its feet  because  it  failed  to consider quick, effective  alternatives  to uparmoring Humvees  like  installing add-on armor kits.  If we purchased more add-on  kits and  reached out  to other vendors, we can get  these Humvees armored now.

390,41,2004-03-17,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, a number of  Members have said this resolution is  simply about commending the troops  and the people of Iraq. If that were  truly  the case,  this measure would  enjoy unanimous support. On the contrary, in what it says and what it fails  to say, it attempts to speak to the handling of the war. It glosses over the serious intelligence failures and serious  misstatements by the Bush administration concerning Iraq’s weapons of mass  destruction.  It papers over the lack of preparation  for the aftermath of the war as well as  the  initial  failure  to actively  seek  international  support and  continued  lack of it. It ignores the equipment  shortages that need to be addressed to  protect our troops. It fails to make any  mention of the 565 U.S. soldiers who  have died in Iraq, or the thousands who  have been wounded, or the sacrifices of  their families.  The  resolution  before  the House  today does not bring credit to this institution. It tries a well-used tactic to  divide and conquer.

391,41,2004-03-17,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my  colleagues if I am reading the same  resolution they are, this resolution and  I quote, commends the Members of the  United States Armed Forces and Coalition forces for liberating Iraq and expresses its gratitude for their valiant  service to our country. That is not a  political  statement,  that  is a commendation, and it should be from all of  us, Democrats and Republicans.  I do not read politics into that, and  nobody else should.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 13⁄4minutes to  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr.  GINGREY).  ",2004
392,41,2004-03-17,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I represent Fort Benning, the home of the  Infantry in Columbus, Georgia, and I  rise in support of the resolution to pay  tribute to those Americans serving in  uniform who have brought liberty to 24  million Iraqi citizens. It is their courage, commitment, and endurance that  made possible the unprecedented success that we have witnessed halfway  across the world.  While soldiers are hunting down leaders of Saddam’s regime, Americans and  Iraqis are working together to construct hospitals and schools and establish a new Iraqi government. As a physician, I know what it takes to provide  health care for a large number of patients. That is why it amazes me to  learn 52 clinics have been renovated  and over 600 have been reequipped to  provide primary health care.  Mr. Speaker, I call attention to this  chart which shows that more than 22  million doses of vaccines have been delivered to 4.2 million Iraqi children and  700,000 pregnant women. In fact, by the  end of 2004, over 90 percent of Iraqi  children under the age of 5 will be immunized against diseases such as polio,  tuberculosis, and measles.  In February alone, 800 tons of highprotein meals were delivered to malnourished children. Sadly, those who  oppose us are not idle. I do not know  how  long the war on terrorism will  last, but I know America is right and  our military and humanitarian efforts  must continue until this evil is eradicated not only in the Middle East but  in the entire world.  While we hope our allies will not  abandon us when we  face  inevitable  hardships,  if necessary, we have the  courage and the commitment to stand  alone.  Mr. Speaker, my prayers remain with  the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines deployed around the world, and  with their families who wait for them  at home with  love and patience.  I  wholeheartedly  support  this  timely  resolution.  ",2004

394,41,2004-03-17,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, in October 2002, I voted to authorize the use  of  force to remove Saddam Hussein,  and I would again. I think it was the  right decision for this country.  I agree with the resolution statement  that the world is safer with the removal of this leader from Baghdad; I  believe  it  is. And the succession of  changes that we have seen in Syria,  Libya, and Iran are evidence of that.  I went to Iraq in January and saw  young people serving this country in  uniform and the leadership that they  showed us, and I was so proud of them.  They have never let us down.  I think today with this resolution we  are letting them down. Leadership is  about unifying people; it is about healing wounds; it is about bringing people  together. There are many patriotic  Members of this body who in good faith  believe the world is not safer because  Saddam Hussein is gone. I respectfully  disagree with them, but we should have  been able to come together today on  the first anniversary of the initiation  of hostilities and focus on the soldiers,  sailors, airmen and marines and the  guardsmen, and we should have been  able to focus on what we agree on; and  what we agree on is we respect their  service, we mourn the loss of our dead,  we are ready to heal those who have  come home wounded, and then we are  ready to debate the foreign policy of  this country as to how we should go  forward. We have let our troops down  by this resolution, and it is a shame. ",2004

396,41,2004-03-17,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, no one can ever forget the  horrific attacks on our Nation of 9/11.  Our lives changed that day; the world  changed that day; and America looked  for answers and we looked for justice.  And we looked, most importantly, for  leadership.  I  think  the  terrorists,  recognizing  the very limp response that America  had made to terrorist activities during  the 1990s, probably thought we would  make a lot of noise, we would be out  here rattling our sabers, and then go  back to our comfortable lifestyles and  that we would not  respond  in any  meaningful way.  Well, these cowards, these terrorists  who prey on the weak and innocent, seriously underestimated the will of the  American people, and they certainly  did not understand the political resolve  of our great President George W. Bush,  our President who understands that his  constitutional responsibilities are to  protect the homeland, to protect Americans.  And so we went to Afghanistan and  toppled the Taliban. We went into Iraq  where we  liberated the  Iraqi people  from the oppression of Saddam Hussein.  Mr. Speaker, recently I had the opportunity to travel to Libya where we  met with Moammar Qaddafi, and as we  all know, he has opened up the borders  to Libya to  let the Atomic Energy  Commission come in and voluntarily  dismantle his nuclear program. Apparently he watched Saddam Hussein get  drug out of a rat hole and thought this  regime change is not all it is cracked  up to be. Clearly the Bush doctrine is  working.

398,48,2004-03-17,Mr. BOSWELL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  HARMAN). I appreciate it.  And I want to say at the outset I rise  to support the resolution. When I look  over there, the gentleman from California  (Mr.  the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. SAMJOHNSON),  and a whole bunch of others, they are  my heroes. But we have some on this  side of the aisle too. I think of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA), I think of the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. REYES), the gentleman from  Florida  (Mr. BOYD),  the  gentleman  from California (Mr. THOMPSON), a lot  of us as well as a lot of my colleagues.  This is not a partisan thing. We support the troops. No question about it. I  was a little appalled this morning as I  heard my dear friend, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA), and  his comments. But I still support the  troops.  Our troops in Iraq are to be commended  for  their courage and  their  valor. I do say the same about the dedicated men and women of the  intelligence  community.  I  visited with  them in Iraq. It is truly inspiring to  see what they have accomplished. And  the Iraqi people are to be commended  for  their  courage  in  the  face  of  Saddam’s cruelty.  But I agree with the remarks of my  colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. HARMAN), the proposed resolution ought to do more. It is time the  President set about fixing the problems  in intelligence that are already known  to exist. This will do much more to secure the peace in Iraq than just commending the troops and the Iraqi people which, of course, is very important.  For example, the DCI has acknowledged that we did not have enough  human  intelligence.  In addition, the  sources we did have too often gave us  bad information. There are also some  indications  that we may have  dismissed potential sources of  information because they were not telling us  or we did not believe or did not want to  believe that Iraq had weapons of mass  destruction.  Closed societies of Iraq are among  the most difficult of intelligence targets. No question about it. Terrorist  groups are equally difficult to penetrate. However, there are steps we can  take to improve our ability to recruit  sources of information on these hard  targets.  The intelligence community is developing new ways of deploying human intelligence  collectors.  In urging  the  President to take steps now to fix intelligence, we can encourage these efforts which will yield benefits in Iraq  today. The proposed resolution ought  to do  this. Why not? We  can. We  should.  I do support the resolution.  ",2004

",2004
400,48,2004-03-17,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank our  very distinguished  ranking member,  the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  HARMAN), for the time.  Mr. Speaker, we are just about a year  to the day that America with our very  brave forces invaded Iraq. So it is coming up to the moment where we commemorate those that serve, those that  did serve and lost their lives, through a  resolution that is on the floor.  This resolution has good parts to it.  Of course, we commend our troops who  are second to none. They are the best  led, the best equipped, and the best performing troops in the world, the best  military. But this resolution  is not  necessarily a celebration, nor should it  be. Because what it does not include  are the sacrifices that have been made:  558 American troops, 101 allied troops,  and some 10,000 Iraqi citizens have died  since this war began. They are not  mentioned in this resolution.  Where is our commitment in this resolution? It should be stated and restated  in more than one  ‘‘whereas’’  about the 115,000 troops in Iraq with all  the protective gear that they should  have. Nowhere in this resolution do we  affirm or reaffirm our commitment to  our troops and veterans.  Today the House Committee on the  Budget cut over $1 billion. So there is  a bit of double speak to this. Nowhere  in this resolution are the people that  serve in our intelligence community,  some of the most dangerous jobs that  anyone could ever have, are they set  apart and thanked in this resolution  relative to Iraq.  Turn on the TV sets. Iraq is not safe.  There are more people that have lost  their lives today. There are more fires;  there are more blow-ups. So this is a  very sobering resolution. And I think  the good parts of it should be underscored. But we have not been allowed  to add to it the things that I just stated that I think should be very much a  part of it. ",2004

I would not say crossing Pennsylvania Avenue in rush hour is safe.  The question is, Is it safer with Mr.  Saddam Hussein in a cell? Or is it less  safe with him  in one of his palaces  plotting to amputate limbs from some  of his people or to bury Kurds alive  like he has done?  The world is a safer place with him in  a  cell  because Mohmmar  Qaddafi  watched that and went to school on  that. He decided to put his cards down  and give up his nuclear pretensions. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT).  ",2004
404,55,2004-03-17,Mr. CHABOT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  join my colleagues in commending the  brave men and women who have liberated the Iraqi people. And I want to express my heartfelt sympathies to those  families who have lost loved ones in  battle. Did we do the right thing? I  would say we did. Hundreds of mass  graves containing the remains of as  many as 400,000 victims of Saddam Hussein have been found in Iraq. For those  of my colleagues who have not seen it,  I would urge them to get a copy of  ‘‘Iraq’s  Legacy  of  Terror:  Mass  Graves,’’ published by USAID. Let me  quote from it:  ‘‘Rows of white bundles containing  bones filled room after room. Families  filed by searching for signs of those  who had disappeared, some stolen during the night, others taken in daylight.  Even small children were not spared  the butchery. Some graves hold a few  dozen bodies,  their arms  lashed  together and  the bullet holes  in  the  backs of skulls testimony to their execution. Other graves go on for hundreds  of meters, densely packed with thousands of bodies.’’  We  have  learned  from  survivors  about Iraqi citizens being indiscriminately detained, men, women, children,  the elderly, the blind, the aged, led to  the edge of a swamp and executed one  by one. Why? Just to let everybody  know who was in charge. We know that  Saddam’s psychopath sons were as evil  as their father. His eldest son Uday  boasted that when it was his time to  rule Iraq he would be even more brutal  than Saddam. It was Uday who routinely had his thugs deliver women to  him so he could rape them. It was he  who was said to have  fed a young  woman to his attack dogs. It is he who  reportedly  abducted  and  violently  raped a newlywed. After she committed  suicide, he had her husband arrested  and executed.  Now, because of the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women of our  Armed Forces, Saddam is behind bars,  Uday and Qusay are roasting in hell,  and 25 million Iraqis are free.  Did we do the right thing? I think we  did. ",2004

406,55,2004-03-17,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I have been in my office  listening to the rhetoric. It has been  very  interesting. People  have  been  talking about how this resolution divides us. I do not think it is the resolution. I think it is the rhetoric. We are  all in support of our troops, but those  who have been over there, as we were  just a couple of weeks ago, know that  our troops know they are doing the  right thing. They know that the Iraqi  people are happy that Saddam Hussein  is gone. We talked to people when I was  over there that said they did not have  400,000 people in mass graves, people  that were tortured in the prison; but  they believe it was more like between 1  million and 1.3 million. Over 1 million  people were thrown into mass graves.  That alone is reason enough to get that  guy out of there.  But  let us talk about weapons of  mass destruction.  In  the  1980s,  the  Israelis attacked a nuclear reactor in  Iraq because they knew he was going to  build a nuclear weapon, and a nuclear  weapon is a weapon of mass destruction. He used, as we all know, chemical  weapons to kill thousands and thousands of Kurds, women and children,  and he used those same things in the  Iran-Iraq war that went on for 7 years.  So this guy used weapons of mass destruction. He violated every single U.N.  resolution that came out of the United  Nations. So why should we believe that  he would not have weapons of mass destruction, that he would disarm himself when he violated every agreement  that he made? And he used weapons of  mass destruction.  The President had every right to do  what he did. Saddam Hussein was a  threat not only to the region but to the  whole world. As far as working with al  Qaeda, you will never convince me that  he was not working with the  international terrorist network,  including  al Qaeda. That guy wanted to destroy  our way of life and everything we believe in.  VerDate jul 14 2003  02:19 Mar 18, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17MR7.092 H17PT1 ",2004

408,62,2004-03-17,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, I associate  my remarks with the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. MURTHA). I rise with concern and dismay on the Resolution before us.  First of all it resolves a sense of the House  of Representatives. How  can  you have a  sense of the entire House when it only has  Republican authors?  How can it be a sense of the House with  not a single Democrat as a co-sponsor?  This Resolution seems  to provide political  cover  for  the President  for  failing  to secure  support from our major Western allies in the  War on Terrorism in Iraq.  This Resolution ignores the fact that we had  no post-conflict reconstruction plan, before the  first bombs dropped.  The Resolution glosses over  the  fact  that  our  investigators, along with  the United Nations  inspectors, have  found no weapons of  mass destruction and were denied more time  to  complete  their  inspections, which  could  have obviated the need to go to war.  This Resolution  is brought up at a  time  when the President’s poll ratings are slipping.  The world is not safer and adoption of this  politicized resolution won’t make it so.  Baghdad is suffering new deaths as we debate, our own home turf suffers from its own  brand of terrorism. Inner city communities are  losing lives in drive by shootings and Americans don’t feel safer.  No, the world is not safer and to get Congress to say that it is, is hypocrisy at its worst.  In an election year, Congress should work  to bring us  together—not  to play political  gotcha.  I urge this body to reject this Resolution. We  can do better. We can truly support our troops  without political excuses. We can commend  the Iraqi people for their courage without taking credit for their courage.  Write a Resolution without partisan politics  and it will get a unanimous vote, which is after  all, what is needed to show support for our  troops—not a house divided for partisan purposes. ",2004

410,62,2004-03-17,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  salute to America’s troops and veterans, and  urge my colleagues  to honor  their sacrifices  not with lofty political rhetoric but with concrete  budgetary reality.  Sadly, we are denied that opportunity today.  Instead, after waiting weeks for a budget and  voting primarily on uncontested matters,  receiving only this week a proposed budget that:  Fails to appropriately address the sad state  of our economy;  Fails to propose policies that will create an  environment for the maintenance and creation  of jobs;  Fails to clearly fund ongoing expenses related  to  the continuing military efforts  in Afghanistan and  Iraq and  fails  to adequately  fund force protective measures as well as first  responder needs for homeland security;  Fails to fund the President’s own promises  with respect to education mandates on local  communities;  Fails to even begin to deal with the nation’s  health care crisis;  Proposes pilfering  plus; and  Forces enormous  further debt burden on  every one of our children.  This Republican House  leadership—I believe in cooperation with the White House— now proposes  to politicize  foreign policy  for  their own domestic political purposes.  It’s a disgrace!  The self-promoted ‘‘uniter not divider’’ in the  White  House  has  at  every  opportunity  slammed any effort at bi-partnership—this resolution  is  one more  example. The White  House has been complicit as House Republicans manipulate and distort rules and customs to wring every ounce of the democratic  process out of  the exercise of government  here, while professing to support democracy  worldwide.  After shamelessly exploiting in TV advertisements the 9/11 tragedies and depicting victims  (whose families the President would not honor  by cooperating with the investigation into circumstances surrounding the incident as well  as intelligence and government action and inaction leading up to and following 9/11) and  first responders (who must continue to labor  on  the  front  lines without adequate communications, equipment, training, standards and  support), this group of Republicans now allows  four hours to debate a resolution the sole purpose of which is to create a dilemma for those  who know the Administration’s effort with respect to Iraq and with respect to fighting terror  to be woefully inadequate.  The resolution is structured with the appearance of supporting our troops, but is worded  the Social Security surso  that  it could be argued—however wrong  such an argument would be—that Congress  endorsed the way this Administration has conducted itself with respect to Iraq.  In essence, yet another  false choice  for  Members: Vote for it, so disingenuous political  operatives can claim  the President  is supported even in his misleading acts and his diversion of efforts from the fight against terrorists and his Administration’s abject failures of  planning  for post-Saddam  Iraq, or Subject  oneself to even more disingenuous assertion  by political hacks—for that is what they would  be—who might assert a vote against the resolution was a vote against support and recognition for our troops.  It is politics at its most base and vile level,  yet this White House and this Republican majority promote it without hesitation.  Well,  it will not work! The American people—even with an all-too-slowly awakening  media—is  learning more each day  that  this  President and  this Republican majority have  very little in the way of meaningful policy for  America—and far too much politics aimed at  benefiting  their careers and  ideological extremists.  Whichever way people vote on this resolution, it will be clear to America that the President’s and  the Republican majority’s hypocritical resolutions will not work any better than  their tasteless advertisements.  The American people deserve  far better,  and the Democrats stand ready with a vision  and a plan to deliver it: Democrats are working to protect and defend America from those  who plan attacks against our  families and  communities. Democrats are prepared to use  military force to protect our security, our people, and our vital interests, and have an unswerving commitment to ensure that America’s  armed  forces  remain  the best  trained, best  led, best equipped force for peace the world  has ever known.  Democrats applaud the troops who ousted  Saddam in 20 days. We want to support them  on their still dangerous mission, and believe  we should be debating giving our troops the  armor—body and vehicle—rifles, jammers and  other equipment they need.  It now appears that the President’s rationale  for war was  flawed. CIA Director George  Tenet admitted that the intelligence agencies  never told the White House that Iraq posed an  imminent  threat.  [Washington Post 3/10/04]  Former Chief UN Weapons  Inspector Hans  Blix stated that the Bush Administration made  up its mind that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction—and wasn’t interested in evidence to  the contrary. [AP, 3/12/04] But the President  and  the rest of  the Administration said  Iraq  posed an ‘‘urgent and unique threat,’’ an ‘‘immediate threat,’’ a ‘‘mortal threat,’’ and an ‘‘imminent  threat’’  to  the people of  the United  States.  [President Bush, 11/20/02; Secretary  Rumsfeld, 11/14/02; Financial Times, 8/27/02;  Press gaggle with Scott McClellan, 2/10/03]  Democrats want  a  full  accounting  of  the  events leading up to the war in Iraq. Americans should be able  to  trust  that what  the  President tells them is true—especially when it  comes to the life and death decisions of war  and peace. Our troops were sent to Iraq without enough  of the equipment they depend on to do their  jobs safely. Un-armored Humvees are falling  victim  to  road-side bombs and  rocket propelled grenades.

412,69,2004-03-17,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I went to Austin with the gentleman  from California (Mr. LEWIS), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOUNG) after  the President was elected but before he  was inaugurated, and I sat at his table,  and I said to him, Mr. President, you  do not have to worry about missile defense, you have got to worry about terrorism and you have got  to worry  about nuclear proliferation.  Then I came back, we went to committee, and under the leadership of the  gentleman from California (Mr. LEWIS)  we moved $1.4 billion out of missile defense and put it into counterterrorism  on September 11, 2001. We could not finish our markup that day because of  what happened. One of the planes went  down in my district. That was the start  of the war against terrorism because  those passengers in that plane took a  stand. They got up and  fought that  plane to the ground. The plane was  probably coming towards the Capitol of  the United States.  The reason that I am so upset about  this resolution, not only because they  did not consult any of us, but because  the terrorists worked with a calendar  and we work with a clock. This is going  to be a long war. We have been discredited worldwide with our intelligence.  I told the story before. When Dean  Acheson, former Secretary of State at  the time, went to meet with President  de Gaulle to show him the evidence of  the Cuban missiles in Cuba, and he offered to show him photographs, he said,  I do not need to see the photographs, I  will take the word of the President of  the United States.  We have been discredited because our  intelligence was  faulty.  I  believed  there was weapons of mass destruction.  I believed that there was an al Qaeda  connection. None of this has turned out  to be true.  A constituent of mine said in pointing to me, he said, Never in history  have so many been misled by so few. I  said, You mean me?

414,76,2004-03-17,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of our  troops and  the work of our  armed forces in Iraq. About a year ago, our  troops embarked on a mission to liberate the  people of Iraq and end the threat posed by  Saddam Hussein.  Looking back on  the year,  it  is  important  that we remind ourselves of the nature of the  threat against  the United States,  the Middle  East, and the Iraqi people. Saddam Hussein  was nothing short of evil. He threatened his  neighbors  through war  and  invasion. He  threatened his people  through  rape,  torture,  and  intimidation. He  threatened  the United  States  through years of nuclear, biological,  and chemical weapons development. Thanks  to  the brave efforts of  the American armed  forces and our Coalition allies, we are now  safer. Terrorists still prowl the earth but one of  their protectors and one who wanted to add  WMD to terrorism is finished.  The mission has not been easy. These are  attacks by terrorist and Baathist forces who remain determined  to undermine  the United  States, the war on terror, and democracy in  Iraq. Our troops, however, are equally determined  to root out and destroy  these  forces.  Despite news reports and a constant barrage  of negative commentary on our mission’s success, American military personnel have routed  the main  Iraqi  forces, rounded up countless  rebels, and restored much of Iraq’s long neglected infrastructure.  I had the opportunity and honor to visit our  troops in Iraq in January. I visited with a number of troops from my district and the State of  Indiana. Among  these  troops  and  among  troops in general, I saw no signs of the low  spirits that some media reports say are plaguing troops. The troops I met complained about  the food, sand fleas and weather conditions,  but felt their service is worthwhile.  None of Iraq’s rehabilitation and reconstruction would have been possible without  the  hard work of American and Allied troops, including the thousands of National Guardsmen  and Reservists who put their civilian lives on  hold to serve their country. Our military relies  increasingly on National Guard and Reserve  units  to  supplement  regular  army  deployments, and the liberation of Iraq was no exception. During this war, members of the 1– 293rd Army National Guard Infantry unit and  the 122nd Air National Guard Fighter Wing  from the Third District of Indiana served our  nation and kept us secure.  I rise support of  this resolution because  I  think the worst thing would be for our troops  to think there isn’t support for them or their  mission in the United States. This resolution  sends a message to our troops that we support them. The U.S. mission was and remains  justified. Our troops were and remain the key  to  this mission’s success.  I will continue  to  support the American troops in the field and  those who have returned from their duty. ",2004
415,76,2004-03-17,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to  this  resolution. We ought  to be  honoring  those who gave  their  lives,  their  limbs and sacrificed their futures for our country. So  far, 565 service members have  lost  their lives, more than 3,000 have been wounded—many losing limbs—and now we are seeing American civilians becoming targets.  Instead, we are here today making hollow  political pronouncements  that  the war was  right and just and that somehow our Nation  and our world are more secure. Unfortunately,  the opposite appears  to be  true. Americans  are  less safe and  the world  is more dangerous—precisely because of the Bush policy  in Iraq.  On this anniversary of the war we ought to  include in this resolution the names of the heroes who gave  their  lives. We ought  to be  honoring and commending these brave Americans for what they have given and sacrificed  along with the troops who continue to serve  valiantly. But, the Bush administration doesn’t  want to talk about—or expose—the 565 Americans who’ve  been  killed  and  the  3,254  wounded.  The omission of  this  remembrance demonstrates that President Bush and his Administration are good at taking credit, but terrible  at accepting responsibility.  We’ve seen  in  the past  few weeks  the  President cloaking himself in September 11th.  He’s put images of ground zero in his campaign ads. I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t  go so far as to give his acceptance speech for  the Republican presidential nomination at that  very site as the entire Republican Party politicizes September 11th at their upcoming convention.  Yet, President Bush won’t attend any funerals or memorial services for soldiers killed in  action in Iraq.  In fact, he’s prohibited access to Dover Air  Force Base to the media altogether. The Department of Defense has broken a long tradition by prohibiting arrival ceremonies because  the images of these casualties are an embarrassment to President Bush.  The President knows that American troops  were sent  to  Iraq  ill prepared and without  enough equipment to keep them safe. Soldiers  face daily threats there. They don’t have sufficient body armor or armored vehicles as rocket propelled grenades and  roadside bombs  take lives and limbs.  The President knows the troops wouldn’t be  there in the first place if he hadn’t misled the  American  people. We  now  know—far  too  late—that  the  intelligence community never  told the President or senior administration officials  that  Iraq posed an  imminent  threat or  that it had weapons of mass destruction. Yet,  President Bush continually referred to Iraq as  an ‘‘urgent,’’ ‘‘mortal’’ and ‘‘immediate’’ threat  in making his case for war.  The President knows his mind was already  made up to go to war. Today, he should know  the world is not a safer place as a result, especially for our troops. I will not support a resolution that falsely makes any such claim.  While  senior defense officials have  told  Congress that we will run out of money and  need another $19 billion  in September,  the  President’s Budget does not include a single  penny of this spending. He simply refuses to  give the American public the plain facts.  America and our security would benefit from  a new approach to foreign policy. Imagine a  President who embraces global cooperation,  respects international law and institutions and  promotes political and economic freedom and  human rights around the globe. Imagine America exercising responsible leadership that reflects our priorities and capable of partnerships that make our world safer.  This would be a fitting tribute to those who  gave their lives in Iraq. We should work for  what these servicemen and women believed  they could achieve: a more secure future for  America and stronger, more peaceful world.  That’s the resolution I wish we were here considering today instead of this overblown rhetoric attempting to justify a failed Presidential  agenda. ",2004
416,76,2004-03-17,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in support of our men and women in uniform.  I cannot however,  in  full confidence, rise  in  support of statements that the world is a safer  place for the removal of Saddam Hussein from  power. The human and financial costs of war  are colossal. This action has been no exception. With the details of the tragic bombing of  a hotel in Baghdad still developing as we debate  this  resolution, we are once again  reminded of  the horrors of war—and  the  long  road ahead. Based on today’s events, and the  recent bombing in Spain, how can the authors  of this resolution say that we are safer?

417,83,2004-03-17,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker, the Governor of my State recently went on a trip to  Iraq. When she returned, she announced that  the President’s Iraq policy should not be the  subject of political discussion. That suggestion  is as problematic as it is unrealistic. Foreign  policy and defense policy are always  legitimate topics of political debate. That’s how we  do things in a democracy. The voting public  has every right to a full and open airing of different points of view—especially when  the  lives of our service members and the treasury  of our Nation are being committed.  Now, with this resolution it seems the Republicans want it both ways. They tell us Iraq  policy is out of bounds for political discussion,  and at the same time they present us with this  resolution. This document amplifying the administration’s spin is nothing less than an election-year endorsement of the President’s Iraq  policy. It will no doubt be denied that it has  anything to do with politics. In fact it’s blatantly  political. It’s transparently political. It’s in-yourface political.  Our troops deserve better than this cursory  salute swaddled in suffocating layers of political celebration. They’ve earned our gratitude  for their patriotism, courage and spirit of sacrifice. More to the point, they deserve a solid  commitment to their well being and the well  being of their families. But that is something  the majority refuses to do. Last week in the  House Budget Committee, Mr. EDWARDSand  others proposed some simple measures along  these lines: TRICARE for reservists; a boost in  imminent danger pay; improved military housing; higher pay for senior enlisted personnel;  increased  family separation allowance; and  more funding for family support centers.  All of this is to be offset by a very modest  rollback in the tax bonanza we granted to people making a million dollars a year and more.  The majority’s  response? Forget about  the  troops—our allegiance is to people making a  million or more. I don’t have any statistics, but  I suspect  there aren’t  too many millionaires  serving in Iraq or en route.  So let’s not pretend this resolution has nothing to do with politics. It’s about the politics of  deception underlying  this war.  It’s about  the  politics of delusion  that we can remake  the  world in our own image. It’s about the politics  of desperation flowing from the realization that  we’re becoming stuck in a no-exit quagmire.  As for the troops, they’re getting thin rations  from  the majority  in  this House. Saying you  support  the  troops  is easy. The  issue here  isn’t whether anyone in this House supports  the troops. We all do. The issue is whether we  can fashion a policy worthy of their valor, dedication and sacrifice. The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  ISAKSON). All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 561,  the resolution is considered read for  amendment and the previous question  is ordered on the resolution and preamble.  The question is on the resolution.

422,90,2004-03-17,Mr. CHOCOLA.," Mr. Speaker, today I  rise to offer an update from the Washington Waste Watch. Every year the  Federal Government wastes billions of  dollars as a result of overpayments of  government agencies, misuse of government credit cards, abuse of the Federal  entitlement programs, and  the  mismanagement  of  the Federal  bureaucracy. The waste exists in every  program in every agency, in every Department of the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, let me share a few examples with you. Accounting errors  prevented  the Department  of Agriculture from being able to account for  $5 billion of its receipts and expenditures. The Department had no way of  knowing where the money came from  and where it had gone.  The Department of Defense spent $41  million to develop a system to track  its ammunition, but 8 years later no  system had been created or was close  to completion.  Individuals defaulting on their student loans cost the Department of Education $4 billion in 1999 alone. An audit  of the Department of Energy discovered that the Department had incorrectly listed $900 million in assets instead of liabilities and could not account for $56 million in missing funds.  That is not all, Mr. Speaker. A 2000  audit of the Department of Labor discovered that 35 percent of the recipients of dislocated worker benefits were  ineligible for the program.  More than a quarter of the  IRS’s  earned  income credit payments were  improper. The error rate  is consistently between 27 and 32 percent of the  total claims. In 1999 alone it cost the  American taxpayers $8.1 billion.  The Veterans Affairs Department  continued to pay the daughter of a veteran $78,000 in benefits after the veteran had died.

423,104,2004-03-17,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for his comments; and  before I yield to the gentleman from  Washington, I just wanted to say when  I was listening to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. INSLEE) and his statement about Republican abuse of power,  that is essentially what this is. This is  an abuse of power by the President and  by the Republicans in the Congress.  And when I listened to my colleague  from Maine and he talked about how  the  Medicare  administrator,  Tom  Scully, had basically threatened Richard Foster that if he told the truth  about the numbers that he would be  fired, what the gentleman did not mention and I will add, is, of course, what  happened to Tom Scully. Tom Scully  during all this, while this Medicare legislation was moving in committee and  moving in the House, was negotiating  to get a job, which he ultimately got,  with the law firm that represents the  pharmaceutical industry. He actually  got a waiver from the President that  allowed him to negotiate for the job.  Normally, the agency rules that he  worked for say that you cannot go out  and seek a job and try to find yourself  a job while you are still in the agency  working on  this  legislation. So  the  abuse is just unbelievable, and the fact  that he got the waiver and everything.  ",2004
424,104,2004-03-17,Mr. ALLEN.," If the gentleman would  yield just for a moment, Mr. Speaker.  There  is one other  finish  to  this  story. We are not sitting here on the  Democratic sides of the aisle making  all  this  up.  Yesterday,  Secretary  Thompson  initiated an  investigation  into these facts: that Richard Foster  was threatened with being fired if he  disclosed the true cost of the Medicare  bill. So now Health and Human Services itself is investigating what clearly, at least to my mind, was an ethical  and perhaps a legal breach by this administration, but one that clearly was  absolutely essential, absolutely essential to getting the Medicare bill to become the Medicare law.  Here again, we see a kind of distortion and misrepresentation of information that really has no place in the  House of Representatives.  ",2004
425,104,2004-03-17,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  to the gentleman from Washington.  ",2004
426,104,2004-03-17,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from New Jersey.  I believe it is very important we bring  this issue to the American people. Because  in this election, the  issue on  which the people have to decide is if  there is anything that comes out of the  White House that they believe. Is there  anything that comes out of the administration, anything, they can believe.  On weapons of mass destruction and  connections to al Qaeda and all the  reasons why we went to war in Iraq, it  is clear they made it all up. Now we  come to the domestic side of things;  and I sit on the Committee on Ways  and Means, and Secretary Thompson  comes before us and admits that when  they did a study on the inequities of  health in this country, that they rewrote it because they did not like the  way it came out. The Secretary said,  well, we are going to change that. The  next thing we know, the same person is  calling for an investigation of his own  Department on the issue of the actuary  hiding the figures from the Congress.  This is the gang that cannot shoot  straight. They cannot tell the truth  about anything. Because if they told  the truth about anything, they would  have to change the way they act. They  could not give all this money away in  tax breaks. They would have to pay for  the programs that they tell the people  they are giving them.  Now, I had a very interesting experience over the weekend, and I suspect  some Members will have the same experience this weekend. I went back to  Seattle and had a community meeting  in a retirement home with about 100 or  125 people there, and I showed them a  video which has been made by  the  Families USA about the whole issue of  the drug issue. Mr. Walter Cronkite is  the narrator. Now, everybody knows  Walter Cronkite. He is so believable  and has so much integrity, he could  tell you the sun was going to come up  in  the West and you would almost  think it was going to because he is so  believable.  Well, these 125 people, and this is an  old  people’s  home, where  probably  most everybody is 70 or older. So we  are talking about people who are real  senior citizens. They  sat  there and  they listened to this, and they could  not believe the things that are in this  thing that have never come out. So, then, we talked about these advertising  statements  they had been  seeing on television. They said those  television ads are not right, they are  not  telling us  the  truth,  if Walter  Cronkite says that, that we are not  going to get any help until 2006, and  that this drug card they are coming  out with is a hoax of the first order.  These are people who  some were  school teachers or business people or  whatever who are retired. They are  now in their 70s or 80s. One of them  said, you know, that drug card, I think  we ought to boycott that drug card. I  do not think we should even bother  taking it. Why would I go and choose a  card and they give me a list, and they  say, now, these are the drugs that this  card covers, and I pay $30 for it; and  then after I got the card in my pocket,  I am locked in for a year and they can  take the drugs off the list.  The  seniors were  incredulous  that  this administration was trying to run  some kind of game on them. I said to  them, the reason you are going to get  this card on the first of April is so you  will have it in your hands when you go  to vote in November. They want you to  believe you have got something from  them. But do not believe there is anything in that card. There is nothing  guaranteed except that you have been  sold a piece of paper for $30.  And these people said, what can we  do to fix this, or what can we do to stop  this? Do you think there will be some  change in this Congress? I said, look,  we are having an election year. Nothing in here is going to be good public  policy. It is all going to be about convincing the American people that the  Republicans have done everything good  for them. And this drug card and this  pharmaceutical bill is simply the worst  of the examples, but there are all kinds  of others.  The video by Mr. Cronkite shows the  donut hole. You could hear the audience gasp when they realized that they  were going to go for a long period of  time, have to pay a premium and have  no benefits. They could not believe  that. And the donut hole does not stay  the same. It grows. Every year it gets  larger.  Finally, the crowning blow of it is  what they discovered. They said, you  mean when we pay this once, up to  $5,100, or whatever, that we have to do  it again the next year? You mean this  happens every year to us? We fall into  the donut hole every year? I said, yes.  I said if that is what you want for public policy as senior citizens, then you  ought to vote Mr. Bush back in, but I  think it is a terrible hoax.  And if Members of Congress have the  smarts to go out and show this video,  they will have turned the whole thing  around. Because these seniors watch  TV, and they are being a little bit affected by those phony ads.  As I was coming over here, I was listening to my car radio. The Department admitted that they had put those  out as fake news reports. They taped  them in such a way that they knew if  they were picked up just as they were  taped, they would look like a news report. b2300  They planned to fake the old folks  out.  ",2004

436,125,2004-03-17,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to the  life and memory of Mancos, Colorado, Mayor  Van Willis who passed away recently at the  age of eighty-seven. Van was a true American  patriot, and a beloved friend and colleague to  many in his Colorado community. In his years  spent  in public service, Van embodied  the  ideals of  integrity and courage  that we, as  Americans, have come  to expect  from our  public servants. As his family and community  mourn his passing, I believe it is appropriate  to recognize the life of this exceptional man,  and his many contributions to his community,  state and country.  Van lived an immensely rich and full life, always holding firm to his beliefs in serving his  community and country. He spent  ten years  serving his nation in the Army, earning a reputation as a solid and dependable  leader.  After moving to Bayfield in 1947, he embraced  the pioneering spirit of Colorado,  running a  ranch there, and later in Mancos. Van dedicated his efforts towards the betterment of his  Mancos community, spending twelve years as  the mayor of Mancos, serving on the board of  the Chamber of Commerce, and serving as  president of the Mancos Community Development. He also held a post command  in  the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was a member  of the American Legion.  Mr. Speaker, we are all at a great loss because of Mayor Willis’ passing, but can be  comforted in knowing he helped make Mancos  a better place for future generations. I would  like to extend my heartfelt sorrow to his sister  Margaret, his children, Linda and Dean; his  grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Mayor  Willis’ selfless dedication to Mancos, the State  of Colorado, and the United States has helped  ensure a promising future for our great country  and I am deeply honored to bring his life to  the attention of this body of Congress and this  nation.  I am proud  to have known such a  great man who enriched the lives of his family,  community and nation. documentation The Nazis’ Last Victims: The  Holocaust in Hungary. Professor Braham has  made a most significant contribution to the scientific historiography of the Holocaust in general and  the  tragedy of Hungarian Jewry  in  particular.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to pay  tribute  to Dr.  Randolph Braham for his remarkable achievements and scholarly contributions  in documenting  the persecution of Jews  in Europe,  particularly his extensive history of the Hungarian Holocaust. The life’s work of Dr. Randolph Braham is a major contribution to the  understanding of the history of the twentieth  century, and therefore it deserves to be recognized and honored by  the Congress of  the  United States.  As George Santayana reminded us, ‘‘those  who  cannot  remember  the past are  condemned to repeat it.’’ Dr. Braham’s important  legacy should help all  future generations  to  learn the dark lessons of the past and thus  enable them in the future to create societies  based on  justice and on values  that will always include respect for the rights of the minorities and human rights in general. f  TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR  RANDOLPH L. BRAHAM  HON. TOM LANTOS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 17, 2004 ",2004
437,125,2004-03-17,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to a brilliant and remarkable scholar, Professor Randolph L. Braham. Dr. Braham is Distinguished  Professor Emeritus of Political Science  from  the City College and the Graduate Center of  the City University of New York, where he is  also Director of the Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies. He is a distinguished member  of  the Academic Committee of  the United  States Holocaust Memorial Council. Professor  Braham is an outstanding scholar and chronicler of  the Hungarian Holocaust whose sixtieth anniversary we are commemorating this  week.  His two-volume work, The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary, won the Jewish National Book award in 1981, and earned  him citations in the New York State Assembly.  In 1995, he was awarded the Order of Merit  Officer’s Cross of the Hungarian Republic.  Born in Romania in 1922, Professor Braham  received a traditional Jewish upbringing in Dej,  a small town in Transylvania. His parents and  many relatives perished in the Holocaust. He  spent 1943–45 in a forced labor battalion with  the Hungarian and German armies in Ukraine.  Later, he was captured and incarcerated in the  gulag where he experienced the horrors of Soviet labor camps.  After  the war, Professor Braham came  to  the United States on a Hillel Fellowship at the  Graduate Faculty of the New School University and encountered many of the e´migre´ luminaries,  including Frieda Wunderlich, Arnold  Brecht,  Erich  Hula,  and  Boris  Mirkineguetzevitch.  Professor Braham  has  spent  over  forty  years as a professor at  the City College of  New York. He  is  the author or co-editor of  forty-two books on  the Holocaust  in central  and eastern Europe including his all important  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  BEAN-AMERICAN  MONTH LEGISLATION  THE  CARIBHERITAGE  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 17, 2004 ",2004
438,125,2004-03-17,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a  resolution designating a CaribbeanAmerican Heritage month. This resolution acknowledges  the contributions of CaribbeanAmericans from the inception of our country to  the present.  Alexander Hamilton, Hazel Scott, Sidney  Poitier, Jean Michel Basquiat, Eric Holder,  Colin Powell, Edwidge Danticat, Jean Baptiste  Point  du  Sable,  Sidney  Ponson, Maryse  Conde´, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Celia  Cruz, Mervyn Dymally and Shirley Chisolm are  just a few of the many Caribbean-Americans  who helped shape American government, politics, business, arts, education, science, and  culture.  Many of us  in Congress  focus on  ‘‘hot  spots’’ in the Caribbean—Cuba and Haiti—and  forget  that we have many constituents with  roots from Suriname to the Bahamas and from  Belize to Barbados.  The  recent  revitalization of a bi-partisan  Congressional Caribbean Caucus forced many  of  us  to  re-evaluate  the  policy  between  CARICOM and the United States, and to discuss proposed and pending U.S.  legislation  that will have a direct impact on bilateral relations.  It is also important that we remember that  our policies  in  the Caribbean affect  the relatives of our constituents. I wrote this resolution to remind the American public that there  are Caribbean-Americans who reside in every  state of the union, and make sure that are recognized and celebrated.  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure to honor the CaribbeanAmerican  community, and  create a month  designated  to  annually  acknowledge  their  service to our society.

439,6,2004-03-30,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  know which Richard Clarke we are supposed to believe. On his watch for 8  years our country suffered  four terrorist attacks: in 1993 the New York  World Trade Center, the Khobar Towers in 1996, in 1998 two African U.S. embassies, and in 2000 they attacked the  USS Cole. Then in 2001, the 9/11 attacks  occurred. The Clinton administration  did nothing. It merely attacked some  empty tents and a Sudan aspirin factory with a few cruise missiles. Richard Clarke himself admitted to PBS in  2002 that they should have taken out  terrorist camps in Afghanistan in the  90s; but, according to him, there were  ‘‘other considerations’’ that prevented  this action.  Now Clarke attacks the Bush administration. Now he  is suggesting that  going into Iraq has diverted us from  the more important goal of defeating  al Qaeda, that we cannot do both. He is  wrong. When we were attacked on 9/11,  President Bush did not waste any time.  He used the full power of our Nation to  take out the Taliban and hunt down  terrorists. Clarke  even  praised  the  President for his leadership.  Richard Clarke is guilty of the worst  kind of spin, changing his story to  avoid blame and make a profit on his  new book.  f  HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AN  IMPORTANT  COMPONENT  OF  MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
440,6,2004-03-30,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I am  here today to talk on the Medicare  Modernization Act. Tax-free  health  savings accounts that are accumulative allows the individual to pick up  basic health care costs and shop around  for quality and service, one of the great  benefits of the Medicare Modernization  Act. The other thing is then moving individuals into catastrophic health insurance plans which will be, obviously,  in essence a lot lower than health care  costs today. What people fear is the  ability to lose their life savings on catastrophic illnesses. By having the catastrophic  health  insurance  account,  that will not occur and it will be at a  cost that people can assume. But the  only way we are going to bring down  health care costs  in America  is  to  make sure that the consumer  is  involved in choosing their services based  upon quality and service. No middlemen, the consumer. That is the benefit  of  the health  savings account. The  Medicare Modernization Act was real  reform, and I am proud to have supported it. f  MEDICARE  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2004
441,6,2004-03-30,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  was at home this weekend in the good  Seventh District of Tennessee reading  the Nashville Tennessean and there on  the front page of the business section  was a story with the headline, ‘‘Some  Seniors Begin  to See Benefit From  Medicare.’’  Mr. Speaker, if you had been listening to the Democrats for the past 6  months, you would be stunned that the  seniors were going to see benefits from  Medicare. But here it is in black and  white. This is what the story says:  ‘‘Seniors who do belong to a Medicare  HMO have been  showered with new  benefits thanks to the Medicare Modernization Act Congress passed  last  year.’’  And this is all before the prescription  drug card and the eventual prescription  drug benefit even take place. Clearly,  the Medicare reform President Bush  and this Congress passed is helping seniors and that is exactly what it is supposed to do.  f  PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES  (Mr. EMANUEL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2004
442,6,2004-03-30,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, when  we were off a couple of months ago debating the Medicare bill, we were told  it was going to cost $400 billion. We  found out all along everybody knew it  would cost $550 billion, and nobody was  told the absolute truth. Most importantly, you were not told. Not a single  new benefit has gone to a senior citizen  and the taxpayers are stuck with another $150 billion hit. Now everybody  wants to talk about the benefit that is  going to come with a discount card giving a 25 percent discount. The costs of  prescription drugs at the pharmacy are  rising on average 19 percent a year for  the last 7 years. So what you are going  to see is what we all know happens at  Neiman Marcus right before a sale,  prices get jacked up as high as they  can and then they offer a sale to give  you a discount from the inflated prices.  That is what is happening to prescription drugs right now at the pharmacy.  Seniors on average pay 40 to 50 percent more for their prescription drugs  than people in Canada and Europe for  the same drugs that have been developed here in the United States. What  we need is a reimportation bill to bring  the prices down, make them competitive, and get world-class drugs at world  market prices rather than the 50 percent inflated prices that we pay here in  America.  f  UNBORN  VICTIMS  OF  VIOLENCE  ACT HEADING TO PRESIDENT’S  DESK  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
443,6,2004-03-30,Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, when a woman  is attacked  and her child is killed, there is presently no penalty for the death of the  child. Until now. Just last week, the  Senate passed the Unborn Victims of  Violence Act, also known as Laci and  Conner’s Law. It is on its way to the  President’s desk. Laci and Conner’s  Law declares that in an assault on a  pregnant woman when a child is injured or killed, there are two victims.  It makes the killing of an unborn child  a prosecutable offense while specifically exempting abortions that are currently protected under Roe v. Wade.  The overwhelming majority, 80 percent of Americans, support the  idea  this law represents. They believe there  are two victims, and they are right.  Criminals are getting away with killing children, in many cases just days  before delivery. This new law will put  America back on record as valuing the  lives of its children.  I want to again thank President Bush  for his unwavering leadership on protecting and educating all of America’s  children.  f  PRICE OF GAS HITS ALL-TIME  HIGH  (Mr. MARKEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2004
444,6,2004-03-30,Mr. MARKEY.," Ladies and gentlemen,  America now has the highest gasoline  prices  in history. OPEC  is meeting  once again to cut the amount of oil it  is providing to the United States even  as we have  130,000 young men and  women over in the Middle East. That is  a disgrace.  President Bush must  insist  that  OPEC increase its production of oil. We  should not suffer. The Christians had a  better chance against the lions than  the American consumer has against  the OPEC cartel. We need a President  who is not going to allow OPEC to tip  us upside down and shake money out of  the pockets of the American consumer.  President Bush must insist that OPEC  give to the United States what it deserves,  an  economy which  is  not  harmed by OPEC with these rising oil  prices which make  it  impossible  for  consumers to pay their bills or businesses to invest in any other service or  product with the exception of their oil  bill.  Tomorrow is the day, Mr. President.  Let us have some relief for the American consumer and for the American  businessman so our economy can grow. f  b1015  IN SUPPORT OF AMENDMENT TO  THE TRANSPORTATION BILL  (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

446,13,2004-03-30,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. TURNER), our  Blue Dog colleague.  ",2004
447,13,2004-03-30,Mr. TURNER of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  we are on this floor today trying to get  our financial house back in order, trying to get this House to adopt a very  simple, straightforward rule requiring  us to pay as we go that has already  been adopted by the Senate.  And it is really hard for me to understand why our Republican colleagues  do not want  to do  this.  I always  thought they were the party of fiscal  conservatism. They always wanted to  balance a budget. Yet now they come  to the floor and claim that the only  remedy here is to cut spending when,  in fact, they control both Houses of the  Congress and they control the White  House. So if they think that is the answer, why do not they get on with it?  We just simply believe that you have  got to run the Congress and the Federal Government like we do any household or any business. We have got to  pay our bills. We have got to pay as we  go. And why do we think that is so important? We think it is important because next year it is projected we will  have the largest Federal deficit in the  history of this country, over half a trillion.  We are going to come to this floor,  and we are going to vote on 13 appropriations bills as we do every year to  fund this government, and we are going  to borrow 60 percent of that total of  those 13 appropriations bills. One could  not get by with that at home. One  could not get by with that in their  business. One cannot get by with it at  city government, county government,  State government. Why do they think  we can do it here in Washington?  My colleagues act like it just does  not matter anymore,  that  somehow  they can just say it is all going to work  out when they presented a budget that  never even purports to get back into  balance.  And deficits do matter. They are  making this country weaker. How can  we defend against terrorism if we do  not have any cushion to fall back on financially? How can we expect to get  this economy going again and how can  we expect to avoid the high interest  rates that everyone projects in the future that will be contributed to by the  fact that the Federal Government is  borrowing all these billions of dollars?  Deficits do matter. That is a simple  rule adopted by the Senate to try to  impose a little discipline on this Congress, on this House. And the truth of  the matter is, if you vote with us, the  Committee  on Rules majority  can  waive this rule any time they get ready  and my colleagues can do whatever  they want to out here.  All we are trying to do is send a clear  message that this Congress and the fiscal conservatives in this Congress believe we need to get back to balancing  our budget, paying as we go, and recognizing that deficits do matter because  they make this country weaker, they  make us have an inability to have a  strong economy, they make it impossible for us to be able to have a strong  national defense.  And  it  is morally  irresponsible to  pass on debts created by this generation to the next generation. We have  got soldiers today in Iraq fighting for  this country that are going to come  home and enter the private sector and  get to pay the bills for the war that  they are fighting that we refuse to pay  for.  There has never been a war in the  history of our country where the American people did not step forward and  pay the bills for the war. This is the  first. We want fiscal discipline. We believe it is important for this country.  ",2004
448,13,2004-03-30,Mr. NUSSLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds to respond.  Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, let  me say to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. TURNER) there is not a Member on  this side that is refusing to pay for the  bill for the war. And if we want to roll  out the record votes in not only this  body but also the other body for who  paid for our men and women over in  the field, I will be glad to do that. Because there will be a very interesting  name that is left off the list. He happens to be running for President right  now.  The second thing the gentleman said  is that we have to pay our bills, and we  agree. Who gets the bill for taxes? Taxpayers get the bill for taxes. They pay  the taxes. Nobody else. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN), a  member of the Committee on the Budget.  ",2004
449,13,2004-03-30,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my friend, the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. NUSSLE), the Committee on the  Budget chairman, for bringing forward  a budget that this House could support  which does, in fact, get spending under  control and does grow the economy.  And  let me respond briefly to my  friend from Texas who just spoke and  my friend from Tennessee who spoke  before that about spending. Because  they seem to be saying that somehow  the Republicans do not care about deficits, do not care about spending. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Let us talk about the truth. The  Democratic  substitute,  which  my  friends on the other side of the aisle  voted for, has not less spending, it has  more spending. In fact, in 2005 alone it  has $21.6 billion more spending. Over 5  years, it has $135 billion more spending.  And that  is more spending on education, they want more spending on  the  environment,  they want more  spending on health care, they want  more spending on science, they want  more spending on homeland security,  they want more  spending on  international commitments. More spending,  not less spending.  Now, they will say in response, well,  we pay for our spending. How do they  pay for it? By raising taxes. And who  do they raise taxes on? They raise  taxes  on what  they  say  are  the  wealthy. Turns out a lot of the wealthy  are  small businesses. Because most  small businesses in this country pay  their taxes through the individual tax  system. Therefore, you are not an entrepreneur. You are an innovator. You  are the person out there creating jobs.  Because most jobs are created by small  businesses, you are going to get taxed  for more spending.  Now, I know people do not like to  hear the tax and spend characterization, but that is what it is. It is more  spending, and it is more taxes. And all  the budget enforcement in the world is  not going to help if you take this approach of more taxes and more spending. That is what they have chosen to  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:26 Mar 31, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K30MR7.021 H30PT1 ",2004
450,20,2004-03-30,Mr. LANTOS.," Madam Speaker, I am  pleased to yield such time as she may  consume  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE), our distinguished colleague and my good friend. Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS),  and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  BEREUTER) as well.  I  represent an enormously diverse  district. I am reminded of the Kosovo  war and the refugees that wound up in  Albania. We found ourselves in Houston hosting a number of those individuals who had come for refuge during  that terrible time of ethnic cleansing.  As I reflect upon that, I reflect on how  important it is for this Nation to remain engaged internationally and to be  able to promote democratization and  collaboration. b1245  My  first  introduction  to  this was  joining the gentleman from California  (Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. BEREUTER) at the European Union.  I want to acknowledge  their leadership, the respect that they  receive internationally, and certainly  in that body, when we discussed the opportunities for Central and Eastern European countries  to be part of  the  NATO Alliance.  I recall visiting the NATO Alliance,  which  is a very,  if you will, strong  structure and I think has a very deliberative leadership at that Alliance and  noted the importance of that institution to Europe’s safety. But, as we  spoke, we recognized that, as these nations would attempt to join the Alliance, there were several things that  they had to engage in. As my good  friend who just spoke on the floor of  the House acknowledged, they had to  overcome the scars of the kind of dictatorships and the kinds of governments  that they had had in the past.  I was very proud to note that they  were eager to do so, to diversify their  economy, to begin to look at opportunities for all of their citizens to be part  of the dream of promoting a diverse  economy and a diverse political system.  They are now welcomed  into  the  NATO  family because they want to  stand united against the war on terrorism or with us on the war on terrorism. They are eager, I think, to find  a way to democratize, and I use that  word in quotes, as it fits both their culture and their understanding. They desire to be allies.  And I would, just as I welcome them,  extend this welcome on the grounds  that we all work together for peace in  this world. It is easy to enter into conflict and war but not so easy to extract  oneself and to promote peace.  Because they have experienced the  devastation of a divided and devisive  government,  bloodshed,  rebellions  through a long history, it is a very fine  statement of the NATO Alliance and  the United States that we have worked  closely with them to bring them to this  point and that they have joined and accepted the criteria for admission into  NATO.  I thank with great enthusiasm the  number of Members of Congress who  independently  through  their  interaction  on  international  parliamentarian exchange have been at the forefront of working with these particular  nations and  to bring  them  to  this  point. So my hat is off to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BEREUTER)  for his continued leadership and interest in collaboration and as well continued exchange in promoting democracy,  peace and freedom, and certainly to my  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:26 Mar 31, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K30MR7.044 H30PT1 ",2004

454,34,2004-03-30,Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.,"  Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 3036, the Department of Justice  Appropriations Authorization Act for  Fiscal Years 2004 through 2006.  During  the  107th Congress,  I was  pleased to secure bipartisan passage of  the 21st century Department of Justice  Authorization  Appropriations  Act,  which comprehensibly reauthorized the  Department of Justice  for  the  first  time since 1979. During consideration  of that legislation, I committed to pursuing a regular authorization process  to ensure that the Committee on the  Judiciary provides the Department of  Justice with clear guidance and continuing oversight.  With an annual budget of around $20  billion and a workforce of more than  100,000 employees, the Department of  Justice is an enormous institution. Its  importance has only  increased since  the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  As chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary, I have worked to provide the  Department with  the necessary  resources to assess, prevent, and punish  terrorist acts that threaten America’s  domestic security while preserving our  civil liberties. The committee has also  worked  to  ensure  that  the Department’s  structure, management,  and  priorities are tailored to best fulfill its  numerous other missions.  Over the  last several months, the  committee has conducted several hearings to identify the needs and priorities  of the department. These hearings reflected  the  committee’s  continuing  commitment to oversee all of the Department’s activities. This bill reflects  the information obtained in those hearings.  H.R. 3036 is divided into five titles.  The first title authorizes the Department of Justice appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. With minor  exceptions, these authorizations generally reflect the President’s budget request.  Title  II makes numerous  improvement  and upgrades  to  the Department’s grant program. Most  importantly, it combines the current Byrne  formula  grant, Byrne  discretionary  grant,  and Local Law Enforcement  Block Grant programs into one Byrne  Memorial  Justice Assistance Grant  Program with an authorization similar  to  the amount appropriated  for all  three programs in recent years and a  formula that closely  follows current  law. The administration has requested  this consolidation as a way of better  serving State and local governments.  It reauthorizes the COPS program  while recasting it as one single block  grant program covering all of its current purposes so local governments will  need only to file one COPS application  for any of these purposes. I believe that  this will greatly improve the efficiency  of the COPS program.  Among other changes, title II provides for new auditing and training capacity for all DOJ grant programs to  eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. It  provides the first statutory authorization for the Weed and Seed Program. It  establishes a congressional medal and  plaque for individuals in units that responded to the 9/11 attacks. And, finally, this reauthorizes the bulletproof  vest program.  Title III makes a variety of miscellaneous changes to other aspects of the  Department of Justice. It requires DOJ  to use existing Federal facilities for  training and conferences as opposed to  paying for private facilities. It also establishes a dedicated privacy officer at  the Department to ensure that the Department utilizes technologies that do  not erode privacy protection relating  to the use, collection and disclosure of  personally identifiable information.  Modeled after the privacy officer this  committee established in the Department of Homeland Security, this provision advances the committee’s uncompromising commitment to the preservation of civil liberties at the Department.  Title  IV  establishes a new office  within DOJ designed to assist in the  capture of terrorists who harm Americans overseas.  Title V provides a statutory authorization to the already existing FBI Office of Counterintelligence.  I introduce this legislation with the  support of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS), and I have worked  closely with him on it in every step of  the way. Bipartisan cooperation was  the hallmark of this legislation in the  last Congress, and I am pleased that  this spirit of bipartisanship continued  in this Congress. We have also worked  closely with the appropriators to meet  their concerns.  H.R. 3036 provides the Department  with the tools, resources and direction  necessary to operate efficiently and effectively. By identifying solutions to  the growing challenges faced by Federal law enforcement, this committee  and Congress will be the strong partner  the Department needs as we work for  the safety and security of all Americans.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. ",2004

456,41,2004-03-30,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland as usual has put  his finger on what the issue is here,  that is, whether we want to move forward with welfare reform or we want to  move backwards.  The problem with the approach taken  by the Republican majority here has  been, instead of trying to reach out and  move welfare reform to another stage,  they have instead decided, on a very  partisan  basis  essentially,  to  craft  their own bill that really moves this  backwards.  Let me just indicate why. The gentleman from Maryland has pointed out  a number of ways. We need to accentuate this. The gentleman from California says we have to help families  who are still on welfare, but the child  care provision in their bill is very, very  inadequate. The literature is not complete, we do not have all the data, but  it is very clear that one of the reasons  welfare reform has worked is because  there has been considerable money set  aside for child care. Indeed, President  Clinton, who brought this issue to the  fore many years ago, vetoed bills originally passed  in  this House because  there was inadequate money for child  care. Eventually this House, on a bipartisan basis, stood up and was counted on this issue; and we passed many,  many more moneys for child care and  eventually President Clinton  signed  the bill.  The contrast between the House and  the Senate on child care moneys  is  very  striking. The  gentleman  from  Maryland mentioned that the Senate  has now passed a $6 billion proposal,  and I think it was a vote overwhelmingly  in  favor, while the gentleman  from California and others get up here  and defend a child care provision in the  bill that was passed here on a partisan  basis that is minor compared to what  is needed.  Health care is another problem. If we  want to help families move off welfare,  we should provide adequate health care  coverage during the transition period.  The Republican majority here has absolutely refused to step up to the plate  on  transitional Medicaid. Absolutely  refused.  And then as to the families on welfare,  the gentleman  from California  mentioned they are moving out of poverty. An essential ingredient of that is  some training so people are trained to  be able to move up the economic ladder. But,  instead, what they did  in  their bill was essentially to take out  the training element as one of the ingredients of a successful effort by people on welfare.  Those are just three of the reasons.  By the way, this training aspect is so  vital, and I think the Republican majority in the House and the President  of the United States have failed to understand, to face up to this fact: poverty is increasing in the United States  of America under their domain. It is increasing. We do not have all the figures; but it is clear, I think, that many  of those still in poverty are people who  have moved off of welfare, who have  not had the adequate training to be  able to move up the ladder and still remain in minimum wage jobs. By the  way, they refuse to raise the minimum  wage, too.  We need to extend the present system, but we also need to move on to  the second phase of welfare reform. I  am hopeful if there is a bill that passes  the Senate that there can then be a  conference and you will not on the Republican House majority side be so recalcitrant and insist on taking good  elements out of welfare reform, one,  and also refuse to put some added ingredients into welfare reform, two.  You have stonewalled. It is not the  Senate. They are now moving ahead.  The question is whether you are going  to be willing to be a partner with them  and with Democrats  in moving this  ahead  instead of moving backwards.  Partisanship  in welfare  reform  is a  dead end. I hope you get off it and we  can move as we did many years ago on  a bipartisan basis and make a further  improvement so people who are now on  welfare  indeed can move off  it, can  have the training, can have the child  care, can have the health care so they  and their kids can move out of poverty.

I would like to remind the gentleman to consider that  the States have been offered some $2  billion more in child care, that is in  our bill, and that is on top of the $170  billion of State and Federal welfare/ child care  funds currently available  over the next 5 years. Also, there is  some $4 billion in TANF surplus that is  available. I might also mention that  another comment was made that there  were unfunded mandates. The fact is  that in this legislation, there are no  unfunded mandates in H.R. 4.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2004
458,41,2004-03-30,Mr. CARDIN.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds just to respond to the  gentleman from California to point out  that the only new money in this bill  that passed this body, the only new  money is some small dollars in regards  to marriage promotion and $1 billion  guaranteed for child care. That will not  even keep up with the current purchasing power, let alone provide the  needed resources to deal with the new  work requirements. In my own State of  Maryland, we have frozen new enrollments into child care because of a lack  of resources.  Madam Speaker,  I am pleased  to  yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California  (Ms. WOOLSEY), who  has been one of the leaders in this body  on welfare reform, children’s  issues,  and family issues.

459,41,2004-03-30,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in support of S. 2231 because to do  anything else would be irresponsible.  We must continue assistance to those  who need help getting back on their  feet, and we must continue that assistance through the TANF program. But,  Madam Speaker, we can do much better.  I speak from whence I came. I know  about welfare. I lived it. Over 30 years  ago as a young mother with three children, they were aged 1, 3, and 5 years  old, my husband left us. I immediately  went to work full time; but to keep it  all together, I went on welfare, aid for  dependent children, while I continued  my full-time work so that my children  could have the health care and the  child care that they needed. b1345  Because I was educated, because I  had good job skills and good job experience, because I was healthy and my  VerDate jul 14 2003  04:26 Mar 31, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K30MR7.059 H30PT1 ",2004
460,48,2004-03-30,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) for her leadership on this bill. She  has been working on this  issue  for  some time, also.  I neglected to mention the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. REYES) who has his  own Vietnam Service Campaign Medal  for his work as a helicopter crew chief  and is now a fine member of the Committee on Armed Services. And I thank  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  SIMMONS) for his work.  Let me repeat in closing that those  of us who have worked on this bill,  have sponsored and cosponsored this  bill, do not at all intend this as a replacement for the global war on terrorism  service medals  and  expeditionary medals. We support those medals. What we think, though, is we need  to recognize that contribution, that camaraderie that comes from our men  and women in uniform that are serving  in Iraq so they can have their own  campaign medal  and  our men  and  women  in Afghanistan  so  they can  have their own campaign medal in addition to the Global War on Terrorism  Expeditionary Medal.  So I urge support of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
461,48,2004-03-30,Mr. SIMMONS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  George S. Patton, Jr., once  said,  quote,  ‘‘The  results  of  decorations  works two ways: It makes the men who  get them proud and determined to get  more, and it makes the men who have  not received them jealous and determined to get some in order to even up.  It is the greatest thing we have for  building a fighting heart.’’ I would only  correct the great General Patton today  by saying the men and women who receive them. Because, as we know, in today’s military forces men and women  are providing an equal contribution.  As my colleague has indicated, service in uniform and service in a war  zone is not simply about awards and  decorations, it is about our national  policy, and it is about working as a  team with other men and women in  uniform. But the awards and decorations they receive provide them with  incentive and provide them with a living history which becomes their career  in service to their country. That is why  refreshing and upgrading the medals  that are offered to our servicemen and  women is so important. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004

463,48,2004-03-30,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Arkansas  (Mr.  SNYDER), my friend, for yielding and  for giving me this time.  Actually, this is a very, very important bill; and I speak in favor of it. As  you know, we have two major, ongoing  conflicts in the Middle East regarding  the American  forces. The  first  is a  guerrilla warfare in Iraq and the second is going after the genesis and the  home of the terrorists in Afghanistan  that caused us so much and continues  to cause us so much international terror.  I voted for the resolution regarding  conflict in Iraq because I felt it was  necessary, based upon the weapons of  mass destruction allegation. We went  in there; and, as a result of the very  tremendous military  field victory of  our troops, we stayed. The ongoing  guerrilla warfare has erupted which is  an effort to do away with the stability  and do away with  transferring  sovereignty  to a  stable,  representative  Iraq. The purpose of those are, whether  they  be  Baathist  or  Fedayeen  or  jihadists or remnants of Afghanistan’s  al Qaeda, trying to destabilize that  government. That  is the purpose of  guerrilla warfare. That is one war in  and of itself.  The second in Afghanistan, the purpose there, of course, was going after  those who have been causing terror to  the United States for quite some time,  beginning 1993 in the World Trade Center; 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing;  in 1998, the simultaneous bombing of  the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya;  and then the boat bombing of the USS  Cole in the harbor at Yemen; and, of  course, September 11, 2001, came along,  was  the culmination. The  terrorists  home base is Afghanistan.  I think there should be separate ribbons for those separate conflicts, and I  think this is very good. I compliment  the  gentleman  from Arkansas  (Mr.  SNYDER) for introducing this. I thank  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  for  the  strong  support.  I  think it is the right thing to do. It  should happen. So then when we see  someone in uniform wearing either or  both of these ribbons, we can recognize  it and say thank you. ",2004
464,48,2004-03-30,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of S. 2057 and H.R. 3104. S.  2057 provides  retroactive  travel  reimburseSIMMONS)  ments  for  troops who returned home before  December 19, 2003 from Iraq and Afghanistan  for  rest and  recuperation  leave. H.R. 3104  provides separate combat medals for the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think you  would be hard pressed to find a Member of  Congress who opposes these low cost bills to  benefit our troops. The only question is: What  took us so long?  During debate on the $87 billion Iraq supplemental  last October,  I  introduced  an  amendment that would have provided for free  travel all the way home from Iraq and Afghanistan for troops on R&R leave, and would have  required separate campaign medals be issued  for service  in  Iraq and Afghanistan, among  other  important personnel benefits. The Republican  leadership  in  the House would not  even  let  this amendment on  the  floor  for a  vote. So here we are six months later, and we  are only just now revisiting the issues.  Why so long? Quite simply, the Bush Administration opposed separate war medals for  Iraq and Afghanistan, preferring  instead  to  issue one service medal for the Global War on  Terror.  I understand  the Administration’s desire to put these operations in a larger context,  but that does not translate to our troops on the  ground. Circumstances  leading up  to and  in  Iraq and Afghanistan were very different, as  are  the challenges our  troops  face on  the  ground today. Furthermore, the Pentagon policy not only authorized a single medal for OEF  and OIF, it does not prescribe service stars to  reflect service  in both conflicts or multiples  tours of duty in the same conflict. This is blatantly wrong. Campaign and service medals  proudly reflect military service in a particular  conflict, enhance esprit-de-corps, and are a  strong part of military history. It means a great  deal to an infantryman to look at his fellow soldiers and say ‘‘Iraq—yes sir, I was there.’’ The British established the Iraq Campaign  Medal to recognize service in, and in support  of, operations  in  Iraq. Australia established  separate  ‘‘Afghanistan’’ and  ‘‘Iraq’’ clasp  for  their Active Service Medal to reward OEF and  OIF service. So why would we deny our servicemen, who are sacrificing so much for our  country, separate medals that can boost morale for such a small price?  And if the Global War on Terror continues  for many years on many fronts as the President has suggested it might, are we to expect  that  the Administration would prefer  that we  issue no new campaign medals in perpetuity?  H.R. 3104 makes sure  this will not be  the  case.  S. 2057 and H.R. 3104 are low cost, long  needed morale boosts  for our  troops  in  the  field, and though it has taken us too long to  get to them, I wholeheartedly urge their passage today. ",2004

469,55,2004-03-30,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I do want to talk about the  pending legislation, so I do not have  time to comment on all the odd things  that the previous speaker talked about,  but a couple must be mentioned.  This assertion that we in the minority are blocking legislation has to be  one of the most bizarre misrepresentations of the actual situation I have  ever heard. We have no control over  the agenda. We are not blocking anything. I wish we could block some of  the stuff that has happened.  But  this challenge  to us  to  stop  blocking Head Start, I have looked all  over. I could not find Head Start laying  anywhere here. We have not hidden it  under our chairs. We are not blocking  Head Start.  Job training, stop blocking job training. Job training is not being held hostage in the Democratic cloakroom. All  of the scheduling is up to the majority.  So this arm-waving about stop blocking things when the majority is entirely in control does not make a great  deal of sense.  I, on the other hand, did appreciate  the honesty of the gentleman when he  sneeringly referred to unemployment  compensation as a handout. He said, if  people are in business, they understand  that that is not the way to go.  I had thought Secretary Snow, the  Secretary of Treasury appointed by the  President,  former head of CSX, had  some business experience. I was pleased  last week when he supported the extension of unemployment benefits. Yes, we  should do more about job creation, but  there are people who are not going to  get  those  jobs  over  the  next  few  months who have been on extended unemployment. The refusal to extend unemployment compensation, and  it  is  not the administration we are criticizing here, it is the majority in this  House, because they are the ones who  will not do it, over the objection of us,  the refusal to extend unemployment  compensation  causes  real  injury  to  working families. And then when the  gentleman says that is just a handout,  he literally adds insult to injury.  But now I want to talk about this  pending legislation. It is not aimed at  providing more people for the military.  There is not an argument that they do  not have enough people in the Officers  Club. There is not an argument that  there are not enough ROTCs around to  service the military. That is not this  legislation’s purpose.  This legislation is to punish those institutions which have said, as a matter  of principle, we do not want them recruiting on their campus unless everybody is eligible. We do not want them  restricting on irrelevant grounds people because of their race or their religion or their gender or their sexual orientation.  As long as the military says that gay  and lesbian people are not suitable to  serve, although, as we have seen now,  during wartime they stopped throwing  people out quite as much because it  turns out gay and lesbian military people, as we know, are quite capable of  doing the job and when they are needed, they are kept on. But the purpose  of this is to penalize those principled  institutions that say we dislike this  discrimination.  Indeed, this legislation helps restrict  the number of people who join the military. We have a shortage of people who  speak Arabic working for the United  States in the military and elsewhere.  About 11⁄2or 2 years ago, seven members of the military who were doing  very well learning Arabic were kicked  out because they were discovered to be  gay or lesbian.  So with your policy of ‘‘don’t ask,  don’t tell and, by God, don’t translate’’  because somehow they will undermine  the security of this country, you are  restricting the entry into the military  of qualified people. And this legislation  does not expand the pool of people. It is  in the service of a policy that unduly  and unwisely  and unnecessarily  restricts the access, and it does it in a  punitive way.  It could be changed. For example, it  says, well, wait a minute, if we are  going to take money for national security, then they cannot stand up  for  their principle of nondiscrimination.  When did the Department of Transportation get involved there? I am all for  public  transportation.  I  had  not  thought it was a matter of national security.  This legislation also says, the gentleman from California alluded to, a  situation where students at Harvard  have to go to MIT, and he said that is  inappropriate. On Page 6 of the bill, it  says that if the Secretary of the Military Department refuses to allow an  ROTC in a particular school, he can authorize or she can authorize those students to go elsewhere. Why  is that  compromise not good enough for the  school? This bill calls for the use of a  system the gentleman from California  said was discriminatory.  I want to just repeat the main point,  because no one really believes and the  military has not said, oh, we are being  so hindered by these recruitment restrictions that we cannot get enough  people. This is to penalize those institutions that are just standing up particularly  for  the  principle  of nondiscrimination and particularly for the  principle  that qualified members of  their university  communities  ought  not to be discriminated against and  punishing them to reinforce an unfair  policy hurts the military. It does not  help it.  ",2004

472,55,2004-03-30,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, we are asking that the previous question be defeated and that we be allowed to bring  up unemployment compensation to extend it; and here is the reason:  I am glad we are debating this because the gentleman from Florida, by  his  discussion, has  exposed  exactly  what is the thinking of the majority in  this House.  Last Friday, I met a fellow, 55, an  electrician, working for more than 30  years. He told me he was going to take  his retirement, his pension, from the  Electrical Workers Union. He was  going to do so even though he lost a  level of benefits. And I said why?  He said, because I have only 2 weeks  of unemployment  compensation  left  and if I do not take early retirement, I  am going to lose my house.  And you on the majority side call unemployment compensation a handout?  It is part of the employment structure  of this country because with employment sometimes comes unemployment.  And you say get a job? You in the  majority, who have been in the majority in this city, in the Senate, and occupying the White House, under whose  dominion three million jobs have been  lost, tell this fellow, and there are hundreds of thousands of men and women  like him, get a job? That is an insult to  the working people of this country.  So we are bringing this up because  you will not bring this bill up for a  straight  ‘‘yes’’ or  ‘‘no’’ vote. If you  brought  it up, you know we would  carry our position.  The gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. FRANK) has mentioned it was said  by Mr. Snow, the Secretary, that the  President would  sign  an  extension  when there are $18, $19 billion in funds  set-aside for this purpose. We do not  want a President to passively say he  will sign it. We want some leadership  from  the President  of  the United  States for the millions of people who  are unemployed and the hundreds of  thousands of people who exhaust their  benefits every month.

475,62,2004-03-30,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Speaker, initially I would like to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS) for  bringing this bill before us. It is something I have looked at for some time,  and it is something that I certainly  support.  It would be my endeavor to bring individual amendments to the appropriations process if we needed to in order  to reestablish the pre-eminence of the  military on our campuses across this  country.  This is something that started back  in the 1970s as part of the protests  against the Vietnam War; and, slowly,  this kind of policy that has been a resistant to recruitment and ROTC on  our campuses across this country has  used every tool available.  Well, I want to announce that this is  about discrimination, this issue is; but  it  is  about  discrimination  against  young men and women  in uniform.  Whenever somebody stands up in a uniform, we will find somebody with another agenda trying to find a way to  erode the values that put them in that  place; and so the argument was made,  for example, the Boy Scouts would be  one, and of course, all our men and  women in uniform in the Army, Navy,  Air Force and Marines and the Coast  Guard are also victims of an effort that  is keeping us from recruiting good people because the campuses have lined up  against the recruitment on campus.  I look forward to the day that ROTC  or any recruiter can set up a card table  on the commons at Harvard University  on the exact  location where George  Washington received his commission as  commander of the Continental Army. I  find that a real offense to the United  States, not to have the freedom to do  that and to promote it.  A statement was made by the gentlewoman earlier that in no other field  can a person be fired for being gay.  Well, no, probably not; but most people  in this country are at-will employees,  and they can be fired for no reason or  any reason at all.  It is not a matter about open discrimination. I reb1645  I would like to relate a little story,  Mr. Speaker.  State Senator Jerry Behn from Iowa  asked the question, when lobbied by  the gay lobby, answer me this: Am I  heterosexual  or  am  I  homosexual?

478,62,2004-03-30,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  First of all, I want to express my respect for my colleague, the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), for bringing this legislation to the floor.  I will say this.  It  is a sad commentary on our time when we even  have to have legislation like this. You  would not really think in a country  that is at war, and we are at war, with  soldiers in the field, young men and  women risking their lives every day,  that such disrespect would be shown to  them by men and women their own  age.  My son is a Marine. I cannot imagine  him being assigned to a college, a university. He has actually left college to  go in the Marines. I cannot imagine  him coming home from the sacrifice he  has made, going on to that college  campus and  seeing young men and  women who, while he was serving in  the Marines, were enjoying their college education because he and other  young men and women sacrificed for  them and served in their place.  The gentlewoman, who I respect from  the San Francisco Bay area, and the  gentleman from Massachusetts, who I  respect, they both said this is about  discrimination. I think the gentleman  from Iowa said it best when he said it  is about discrimination, but it is about  discrimination  against  our military  and those that serve in our uniform.  Let us not involve our young men  and women who are risking their lives  every day. Let us not involve them in  some policy discussion. Let us not endanger their lives and the lives of those  who serve next to them in this debate.  If law students want to debate this  issue,  if they want to write  in the  paper, that is one thing, but when they  block military recruiters, as they have  done, it is time for us to end this foolishness. It is our responsibility as a  Congress. Support this legislation.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I am in strong support  of H.R. 3966, which would require that  colleges and universities give military  recruiters the same access to students  as other employers.  We as a Nation depend on the brave  service of our military to protect our  homeland, but do we honestly think  that we are going to recruit the best  and  the  brightest  young men  and  women to serve if their schools are not  even  letting recruiters  in the door?  And that, Mr. Speaker, is exactly what  is happening. That is why we need this  bill.  Mr. Speaker, we rely on an all-voluntary force, which means that students choose whether or not to serve in  the military or to pursue a civilian career. I hope that we can all agree that  for our safety and the safety of our  children  and  our  grandchildren we  want to have the smartest and the  most capable military possible. But,  remarkably, some schools choose to  leave military recruiters out  in the  cold. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3966 will serve  to right this terrible policy of excluding military recruiters from our campuses.

486,69,2004-03-30,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  the House of Representatives again  today refused to extend unemployment  compensation benefits. Almost 1 million Americans since December have  lost have  seen  their unemployment  benefits expire. That is 1 million people. That is 1 million families, people  who are looking for work, people who  cannot find work in this economy.  In my state of Ohio, 300,000 people  have lost their jobs. That is 2,000 people every week. Two hundred and sixty  people have lost their jobs every single  day of the Bush administration.  Their answer is more tax cuts for the  wealthy, hoping it trickles down, and  more  trade agreements  that hemorrhage jobs overseas.  We  should  extend  unemployment  compensation benefits to those 1 million workers. We should pass CraneRangel, a bipartisan initiative to give  incentives to American manufacturers  to hire Americans and to manufacture  in this country.  f  COMMUNICATION  FROM  THE DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF PERSONNEL  AND BENEFITS, OFFICE OF THE  CHIEF  ADMINISTRATIVE  OFFICER  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  KLINE) laid before the House the following  communication  from Estelle  Jones, Office of Personnel and Benefits,  Office of the Chief Administrative Officer.

487,76,2004-03-30,Mr. BAIRD.," Mr. Speaker, could I ask  my colleague a question  if  I may?  There is a recent book out, I think,  called The Vulcans, and we have read  over the last couple of decades of plans  for shadow governments, shadow administrations. I do not recall reading  in  the Constitution  of  the United  States that the executive branch is empowered to create a shadow government. I do not recall reading it. I do recall, correctly I believe, that the Congress is empowered to provide through  statutory language mechanisms to replace the President and the Vice President should those two seats be vacant.  In the gentleman’s estimation and  thought, as he has spent a great deal of  time, which does he think would have  more  legitimacy with the American  public, a public process enshrined in  statute,  debated  thoroughly  by  the  House and Senate and passed into law  that gives a clear cut, unambiguous  line of succession for who will be President and Vice President or a shadow  government created covertly and operating covertly to run the institutions  of this country without a Congress to  exercise oversight?  ",2004
488,76,2004-03-30,Mr. SHERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, clearly,  the gentleman from Washington will  not be surprised if I say that a clear  and transparent system for installing a  successor President would  be  preferable.  There are some plans to deal with  top-level civil servants in the bureaucracy and to see if this civil servant is  unavailable, that civil servant would  do his or her job. But all of this must  take place under a legitimate President, and the  fact that our present  statute has all the problems I have outlined, from ambiguity to lack of continuity  of  policy,  creates  a  circumstance where we could have a careful scenario as to which bureaucrats  are running what and no scenario as to  who is overseeing the whole group.

506,104,2004-03-30,Mr. ENSIGN.," Mr. President, I rise to  talk about jobs in the United States  and something that is happening to our  country. We have very complex international tax laws. To go into them,  people’s eyes would glaze over in complete boredom. Suffice it to say, because of  the complexities, we have  tried over the years to get U.S. companies on a more level playing field.  In the past year, the international  bodies  that  have  jurisdiction  have  ruled against the United States versus  the European Union regarding the way  we treat U.S. companies doing business  outside of the United States. Therefore, because we have not  fixed our  laws, they have decided to put a 5-percent tariff on many of our manufactured goods. Starting this month and  for every month thereafter, that 5-percent tariff will be raised by 1 percent.  As a matter of fact, by this time next  year it will be up to 17 percent, which  puts American manufacturers at a tremendous  global  disadvantage when  compared to the European Union.  If Members  care  about manufacturing jobs in this country, it is important this body bring back the JOBS bill  that we had before us in the Senate  last week that was filibustered and get  it passed. The other side keeps talking about,  manufacturing jobs and exporting jobs  and outsourcing. If people really care  about manufacturing jobs in this country, we will bring the JOBS bill back  up to the floor and get it voted on and  get it worked out between the House  and the Senate and get it down to the  President so he can sign it into law so  we can start giving more help and more  relief to manufacturing  jobs  in this  country.  Let me read a quote from the Washington Post of  last week, quoting a  Democrat tax aide saying: There’s not a lot of incentive for us to figure out this [FSC–ETI] problem. That  is the problem I  just talked  about with the international tax laws  with our country and the tariffs.  The Democrat aide went on to say  that ‘‘allowing the ETI problem to fester would yield  increased  sanctions  that could benefit the Democrats  in  November.’’ Well, if this is true, this is an appalling statement. This debate should be  about policy, not petty politics.  So let’s look at what is inside of this  JOBS bill.  Not only would it end the $4 billion a  year of tariffs against U.S. exports— and, by the way, those exports include  grain, timber, paper, and manufactured  goods. I realize, for some, this may be  too politically tempting to  let pass  by—but this bill, by ending those tariffs, would put us on a more level playing field with European Union companies.  The CBO says we have lost 3 million  manufacturing  jobs  in  the United  States since the year 2000. We have  been losing gradually, since the late  1970s, manufacturing jobs in the United  States. That is part of the entire global  economy, but it is important that we  at least allow U.S. jobs to be on a level  playing field.  The JOBS bill to which I referred,  that was being  filibustered, provides  $75 billion of tax relief to our manufacturing sector to promote rehiring in  U.S.-based manufacturing firms.  This JOBS bill gives a 3-percentagepoint tax rate cut on all income derived  from manufacturing  in  the  United States—it is not for manufacturing offshore—and we  start  those  cuts in this year. This manufacturing  rate cut applies to sole proprietors,  partnerships,  farmers,  individuals,  family businesses, multinational corporations, and even foreign companies  that decide to set up operations within  the United States and provide jobs in  the United States.  The bill also extends the R&D tax  credit through the end of the year 2005.  Now, the R&D tax credit is absolutely  a jobs producer in the United States. It  is for doing research and development,  which betters our companies, which  betters  our  economies,  and  creates  high-paying jobs in the United States.  The bill also extends, for 2 years, the  tax provisions that expired in 2003 and  in 2004, such as the work opportunity  tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax  credits—obviously, important pieces of  legislation.  The bill also provides incentives for  newly  constructed  rural  investment  buildings, for starting or expanding a  rural business in rural high-outmigration counties.  The JOBS bill includes brownfields  revitalization. Those  are  inner-city  areas. Because of environmental concerns, frankly, many inner cities have  dying areas because companies cannot  go in. Because of the environmental liability of what somebody dumped there  before, they cannot go in and create  jobs in the inner cities. That is why it  is important we get this part of the bill  done.  I also want to now talk about what I  think is probably the most important  part of the tax bill, and it is called the  Invest in the USA Act, a bill that I  have sponsored with Senator BARBARA  BOXERof California.  This bill would allow U.S. companies  that have invested abroad—they have a  little over $600 billion  invested that  they have made money on and they  have sitting  in their bank accounts  overseas.  If  they bring  that money  back to the United States, they will  pay up to a 35-percent tax on it. There  is not a lot of incentive for them to  bring the money back. Other countries  do not treat their companies that way,  so they are able to actually bring the  money back to their countries to create jobs in their countries.  This past weekend, Senator KERRY  talked about that issue. He now supports the idea of giving a tax break for  the money coming back into this country. Last year, we had a vote on our  bill, and all 50 Republican Senators and  25 Democratic Senators agreed it was  time to bring this money home at a  very low tax rate—a 5.25-percent tax  rate.  Senator KERRYhas now embraced the  idea of bringing it home, but he wants  it taxed at 10 percent. The problem  with taxing it at 10 percent is, because  of the low cost of borrowing money  today, it would actually be cheaper for  the companies to borrow money in the  United States than to pay the 10-percent tax and bring these funds home.  So Senator KERRY recognizes it is a  good thing to bring the money home.  Unfortunately, the fix that he has will  not bring the money home.  The bill that Senator BOXER and I  have proposed, that received 75 votes  on the Senate floor, and now is part of  the big JOBS tax bill, does bring the  money home. Estimates are that it will  bring at least $400 billion to the United  States. That is a lot of money. As a  matter of  fact, that  is more money  than was raised in all of the initial  public stock offerings from 1996 to 2002.  That is a huge stimulus to our economy. That will produce a lot of goodpaying U.S. jobs that we so desperately  need right now.  The economy is growing. GDP is up.  There are increases in productivity. We  are obviously doing well with home  sales. Where we are not doing as well  as we would like is in the area of new  job creation. There are a lot of new  self-employed jobs that are being created, but on the payroll survey many  of those jobs are not being reported.  This bill—for those who want to increase and extend the temporary unemployment insurance benefits, for those  who want to do all kinds of Government programs—will make those types  of provisions unnecessary.  So if the Democrats in the Senate  want to do something about jobs for  this country, they will quit trying to  put all kinds of extraneous provisions  onto the bill, and we will get a jobs bill  done this year.  Mr. President, I yield the floor. ",2004

513,111,2004-03-30,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  yield myself such time as I might consume.  I am going to vote yes on the amendment of the Senator from Maine. There  are several reasons.  I have already stated yesterday in remarks that I believe the next phase of  welfare reform must focus on strengthening work and opportunities for people to move from welfare to work. Of  course, work is the key to self-sufficiency. Hence,  this  bill;  this  bill  strengthens work.  It would  increase  the participation rate requirement for  States as well as increase the standard  hours for individuals.  The typical welfare adult case is usually a  single mother with a young  child, many of whom lack even a high  school degree. These are women who  work more  often  than  not. These  women more often than not have families in crisis. They can’t find a way to  make their lives work. They need help.  If we are asking these women to go  to work and to move from part-time to  full-time work, if that is the case for  some, childcare is an integral part of  ensuring they can successfully meet  the challenge required by law—a challenge that is good for society. Moving  people out of welfare into the world of  work is the only way they can move up  the economic ladder. A life of welfare  is a life of poverty.  Lack of good, affordable childcare is  often a barrier to succeeding in the  workplace. I am committed to doing  everything I can to help these families  succeed in work. That is good for the  taxpayer as well as for the families. I  have come to the conclusion that increasing funding for childcare is a key  to accomplishing that goal.  As we know, States are facing budget  deficits and childcare funding in those  States has been frozen. Certainly in the  context of a debate over welfare reform  and progress, we  should be mindful  that States have spent resources to  provide childcare to families attempting a transition from welfare to work.  I believe in the context of the debate  over welfare reform we should consider  whether it is important that we provide a  level of  funding sufficient so  States can maintain the childcare supporting services they have been providing to welfare recipients and low-income families. I have concluded it is  important to continue those services. I  recognize in order to do that, we need  to provide additional resources in the  specific area of childcare.  If  we  were merely  to  increase  childcare funding at a rate to keep up  with inflation on the current level of  spending, we would  increase  it  by  about $1.5 billion. If we include the $1  billion already in the bill before the  Senate as it was reported out of committee and adjust that for inflation as  well as  including what the Congressional Budget Office estimates are the  childcare costs associated with increasing the work requirement, we are close  to $3.3 billion in additional childcare  costs. This is what we know. We know  we need at least $3.3 billion to meet the  challenge of childcare. Now we have  heard we need anywhere from $4 billion  to $5 billion for States to continue providing services related to childcare.  I don’t think we know for sure the  exact increase of childcare funding we  need to maintain the current level of services. However, I do think we need  to assume there is a need, and an increasing need.  I do not believe $6 billion over 5 years  is  an  unreasonable  increase  in  childcare funding, given the increase in  the work  requirements,  the current  State budget situation, and the importance of maintaining at the very least  the current level of childcare support  available to low-income families.  Therefore, I will vote for the Snowe  amendment. I ask my colleagues to do  likewise.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  yields time?  The Senator from Delaware.  ",2004
514,111,2004-03-30,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, I want  to say how gratified I am to hear Senator GRASSLEY. I was very much encouraged to hear the comments of Senator HATCH.  As I see, we have been joined on the  floor by Senator SNOWEof Maine, the  author of this amendment, and by Senator DODD, who spoke just a few minutes ago.  I want to express to them my heartfelt  thanks  for  their  leadership  in  OFFICER. Who  bringing this issue before us, and for  working to build consensus around this  amendment. I strongly support this. In explaining  that support, I go a long way back in  time, back to 1936. In 1936, we did not  have a welfare program at the Federal  level in this country. In 1936, we adopted something after the encouragement  of FDR that largely provided cash assistance to widows with children. Over  the years, from 1936 through World War  II and into the 1980s and 1990s, welfare  changed.  By 1996, when welfare reform was  adopted, widows and children were eligible for cash assistance on AFDC, Aid  to Families with Dependent Children.  A lot of the people receiving AFDC had  children. For the most part, they were  not widows. For the most part, they  had never been married.  Despite the best of intentions, what  we created after 1936 was a program  that encouraged many women to have  children, oftentimes at a young age;  encouraged men to impregnate them;  and encouraged the men to walk away  from the children they helped to create  as if they had nothing to do with it.  That is not to say welfare as we knew  it did not do a lot of good. It did. But  it also caught a lot of people in quicksand from which they found it difficult  to escape.  Members may recall the debate back  in the 1990s. Bill Clinton, when he ran  for President, said we need to change  welfare as we know it. One of the reasons is, in the early 1990s, a lot of people were better off on welfare than they  were working.  For the folks who went to work, who  got off of welfare, here is what they  gained: They gained the right to pay  taxes, State income taxes, Federal income taxes, Social Security taxes.  Here is what they lost: They may  lose their health care, their Medicaid  health care; they may lose food stamp  eligibility;  they may  lose  assisted  housing; they have to figure out how to  pay for transportation to get to a job;  and they will have to figure out how to  pay for childcare.  That all changed effectively in 1996.  A lot of Governors were involved, including some who serve here today:  Governors VOINOVICH, ALLEN, myself,  and EVANBAYHof Indiana worked with  a whole lot of other Governors, including John Engler of Michigan, to provide unanimity on  the part of  the  States and the National Governors Association, who said we have to change  this system. People ought to be better  off when they go to work than when  they are on welfare.  When we created the block grant approach,  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy Families, we said States have  some flexibility in using that money  that is allocated to them. They can use  it for cash assistance, they can use it  for childcare, they can use it for transportation assistance, they can use it  for medical assistance, as well. Interestingly enough, as the welfare rolls  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:44 Mar 31, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30MR6.005 S30PT1 ",2004

518,118,2004-03-30,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President, we are debating welfare reform. It is critical to  our country that we do this and revitalize it. It is a major piece of legislation that has been very successful over  the years, getting people out of welfare  into a productive job in our economy.  I don’t know who the historian was  who once said it. He was an economist  and a historian. He said, The greatest  form of welfare in the world is a good  job in the private sector—we know that  to be a fact—a good well-paying job.  When you cannot find that, welfare  in our country is that safety net we  have designed and defined  for those  who truly need it, but recognizing that  it is not a place to stay; it is a place to  catch you if you fall, to help you, and  to provide for you and your family, but  only in the temporary form so we can  get people off of welfare and back out  into the private sector and into a job.  In a few moments, the Senator from  Massachusetts is going to talk about  jobs and level of pay in those jobs. I  thought  for  just a  few moments  it  would be appropriate as we talk about  welfare and as we talk about jobs and  how much we pay for jobs as a minimum wage, that we ought to talk  about job creation in this country and  how critically important it is.  Some have said our recovery out of  this recession has been jobless. Well,  that is not true. A lot of jobs are being  created out there, and a lot of people  are now going back to work—not as  rapidly as we had hoped they would,  but certainly they are headed back to  work.  NATIONALENERGYPOLICY  But there is a dark cloud over the horizon, and that dark cloud  is there  today  because  the Congress of  the  United States, and the Senate in particular, a year ago denied this country  a new national energy policy and the  ability  to begin  to produce energy,  once again.  We are no longer energy independent.  That one driving force we had in the  economic matrix that said we could  produce something for less—because we  had the great ingenuity of the American workforce and because the input  of energy was less than anywhere else  in the world, so we could produce it  better and we could produce it for less  cost—is no longer true today.  If you went out this morning to refuel your car before you headed to  work, you paid at an all-time high  level of gas prices. Why? Because the  Senate of the United States denied this  country a national energy policy.  We know it is happening. We have  seen  it headed  in that direction  for  over 7 years. Many of us have pled on  this floor to develop that policy to get  us back into production. But, no, we  are not  into production, we are not  producing at a level we could be and we  should be. We are not creating all the  kinds of alternative fuels we ought to  be. Why? Because we have not established a national energy policy in the  last 8 years.  The world has changed a great deal.  We are now over half dependent on foreign sources of oil. Of course, there are  many who will rush to the floor and  point a finger at OPEC or point a finger at the political turmoil  in Venezuela and say: Well, that is their problem, and it is their fault we are paying  higher energy prices. Or we will have  that proverbial group that will run out  and point their finger at big oil.  Why don’t we point the finger at the  Senate, for once, which has denied this  country a national energy policy? The  Senator from New Mexico was on the  floor a few moments ago, ",2004
519,118,2004-03-30,Mr. BINGAMAN.," He worked 2 years ago to get one.  I helped him, and we could not quite  get there.  Then the other Senator  from New  Mexico did produce a policy, and we  passed it in a bipartisan way. It went  to the House, and we conferenced it,  and the House passed the conference. It  came back here. It fell apart. It fell  apart for one little reason or another,  but the bottom line was the politics of  it. The Senate of the United States has  again denied  the consumer and  the  working man and woman the right to  have an energy source and a competitive energy price to go to work on, or  to work with when they get to work, or  to have for recreation, or to have to  heat their home, or to have to turn the  lights on in their house, and to illuminate and energize the computer they  use.  The driving force of the economy of  this country is not the politics on the  street today; it is the politics of energy. It always has been. When we have  competitive, moderate-to-low  energy  prices,  the  American  worker  can  produce and compete with any workforce in the world. But today we are  slowly but surely denying them that.  Natural gas is at an all-time high.  Gas at the pump is at an all-time high.  Electricity  prices  in many  areas  around this country are at an all-time  high. The great tragedy is, many of  those prices are artificially inflated because of the politics of the issue, because this Senate has denied the American worker and the American consumer a national energy policy.  Now, some say, well, the wealthy are  going to get wealthy off of this. What  about the poor? Has anybody ever calculated that high energy prices impact  poor people more than any other segment in our society?  If you are a household with an average annual income of $50,000, you only  spend about 4 percent of your income  on energy. But if you are a household  with an  income between $10,000 and  $24,000, you spend 13 percent; you spend  a higher proportion of your total income on energy. If you are a household  of $10,000 or less, or at about 130-plus  percent of poverty, you spend almost 30  percent of everything you make on energy—whether it is the gas you put in  your car, or the throwing of a switch to  illuminate the light bulb in your ceiling, or the heat for your home.  High energy prices impact poor people more, and yet we will still hear  these great allegations on the  floor  that somebody is going to get rich off  of energy.  No. Poor people are going to get  poorer with higher energy prices. That  is the impact and the reality of the  problems we face.  The United States is making do now  with a lot less energy on a per capita  basis. Some say: We can just conserve  our way out of this situation. We are  doing a very good job in conservation  today than we did, let’s say, 20 years  ago.  Let me give you a figure or two. In  the last three decades, the U.S. economy has grown 126 percent, but energy  use has grown only 30 percent. In other  words, as our economy grows today, as  a rate of a unit of production, we use  less  energy. Why? Efficiencies, new  technologies. But as we grow, we are  still going to need more energy. So the  old argument about conserving your  way out—and, oh, my goodness, if I  have heard it once on the Senate floor  in the last 6 years, I have heard it 2 or  3 times, that automobile fuel consumption has dropped 60 percent in that 20year period. And we ought to be proud  of that.  That is partly a work of the Senate,  but that is also the new technologies  and efficiencies. Per capita oil consumption is down 20 percent since 1978.

521,125,2004-03-30,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts  is insincere about moving forward on  both this minimum wage increase as  well as moving forward on this bill. I  will offer a unanimous consent request  to do just that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow morning, at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic  leader, the Senate proceed to  back-to-back votes, first in relation to  a Republican minimum wage amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment, with no  second  degrees  in  order  to  either  amendment; provided further that the  bill then be limited to germane amendments, and at 9:30 a.m., on Thursday,  April 1, the substitute amendment be  agreed to, the bill be read a third time,  and the Senate proceed to a vote on  passage of the bill, with no intervening  action or debate. Finally, I ask consent  that following passage of the bill, the  Senate  insist on  its amendment, request a conference with the House, and  the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.  Before the Senator from Massachusetts  comments  on  this  request,  I  would  suggest what  this unanimous  consent request says  is the Senator  from Massachusetts will have a vote on  his amendment, the Republicans will  have a vote on a side-by-side amendment, we will go to final passage on  this bill, with germane amendments  being offered and voted on in between  that time; and after passage of the bill,  this bill will go to conference, and we  will have an opportunity for the House  and the Senate to work their will and  to actually get this welfare reauthorization passed for another 6-year period.  So if the Senator from Massachusetts  is sincere about getting the minimum  wage increase voted on here in the Senate, and not holding up this piece of  legislation, I would hope he would be  willing to accept this unanimous consent request.  ",2004
522,125,2004-03-30,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  objection?  The Senator from Massachusetts.  ,2004
523,125,2004-03-30,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  thank the Senator for commenting on  my sincerity because I indicated yesterday I was interested in a 15-minute  time  limitation on this amendment,  and it was objected to by the Senator  from Iowa. We indicated we were willing to vote at 3:30 today, and it was objected to.  So now the Senator, if he wants to  amend that request—since these are directly related to the issues of employment—to include an amendment with a  1-hour time limitation on the issue of  overtime, an amendment with a 1-hour  time limitation in terms of unemployment compensation, and then to have  relevant amendments and time limitations on those amendments of up to an  hour, I would not object to that.  So, Mr. President, I object, and I  offer  a  unanimous  consent  request  along the lines I mentioned.  ",2004
524,125,2004-03-30,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Objection is heard.  Is there objection to the modified  unanimous consent request of the Senator from Massachusetts?  ,2004
525,125,2004-03-30,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  think it goes to state the case that the  Senator from Massachusetts, in offering these other ideas, is in fact not interested in the Senate working its will  on welfare reform, which is the bill before us, but bringing the political motives and debates that are surrounding  the Presidential campaigns here on the  floor of the Senate, and to have sort of  ‘‘message  theme’’ amendments on a  very serious piece of legislation that  needs to be passed to create opportunities so this line on this chart can continue to go down.  Because what we have with the welfare  reform  reauthorization  bill  is  something that is going to continue to  move people out of poverty, to create  better opportunities  for work. What  the Senator from Massachusetts is suggesting is, instead of that, we are going  to  extend  unemployment  benefits.  What we need to do is create better incentives and better education, training,  and  an  enormous  amount  of  childcare to help people go to work,  not extend unemployment benefits.  Again, we are in this situation where  the Senator from Massachusetts said:  Well, if we just do this. Now it is: Well,  you need to do this, and this, and then  this. The bottom line is, we have a lot  of  substantive debate  that can and  should occur on  this  legislation.  If  there are  relevant amendments, we  would be happy to debate them. But  the  amendments  the Senator  from  Massachusetts now wants to bring in  are not relevant, and, therefore, I have  to object.  ",2004

527,125,2004-03-30,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  I  would like to spend a few minutes talking about this bill and the importance  of why we need to move to the passage  of it.  The Senator put up his chart of minimum wage increases. I voted for those  minimum wage increases. I would vote  for a minimum wage increase in the  next 10 minutes if we could have gotten  that agreement.  I would have been  happy to vote on a side by side, and I  would have supported Senator MCCONNELL’s amendment, which would have  raised the minimum wage, and would  have raised it by over a dollar over the  next couple of years.  I think it is important that we talk  about this issue. But I think the most  important thing we can do for the poor  in America—and I found it remarkable  the Senator  from Massachusetts can  look at his chart, that shows the minimum wage at very high levels in real  dollars, during a time when child poverty, and particularly African-American poverty, has been at its highest  and he says it only makes sense if you  have high minimum wage, you are  going to have low poverty rates.  Tell  the people  living during  this  time who were experiencing high poverty rates how much sense it made. Because in reality it made no sense because  it was not happening. A high  minimum wage does not guarantee low  poverty. What, in many cases, a high  minimum wage guarantees  is unemployment and very high rates of poverty.  What we have is a situation where we  had higher rates of the minimum wage.  We also had a welfare system that was  debilitating on the poor, designed by  the very same people who think the  minimum wage is the answer to poverty.  It is the same economic team, folks,  which believes Government micromanaging of every person’s life and business in America is the way to make  sure everybody achieves. Guess what.  It did not work. It did not work. What  worked? Work. Yes, what every American knows. But there is a commonsense deficit in this city. What every  American knows, as common  sense,  that work works to improve people’s  economic status in life, has been lost  here in the Senate, was lost for many  years when it came to the issue of poverty in America.

529,132,2004-03-30,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I would  like to say a few words about the pending amendment offered by the Senators  from  California  and Massachusetts;  namely,  the minimum wage amendment. I would like to point out the effect of the current minimum wage on  people today, and particularly as to  where they are with respect to poverty  in America.  Let me refer to this chart. This chart  represents the relationship between the  minimum wage and the poverty line for  a family of two, beginning in the year  1988, and up through the year 2002.  From this chart you can see, quite  visibly,  frankly—with  the minimum  wage represented in green and the poverty line being the line just below the  blue—that as the minimum wage increased in 1989, and in a step sort of  function up to 1998, that for a person  who had a job, with a family of two— let’s say a single mom had a full-time  job but made the minimum wage—they  were still below the Federal poverty  level, until about 1998, and then they  could just barely surpass the poverty  level.  I point this out because it does not  seem right that a person who has a  full-time job at a minimum wage still  lives in poverty.  Now, that is bad enough. But let me  show you how much worse it gets. This  next chart shows the relationship between the minimum wage and poverty  for a family of three: let’s say a mom  and dad and a child. By this chart one  can tell very easily that the gap between the poverty line and the minimum wage is much greater for a family of three than it even is for a family  of two. In fact, if I have my numbers  correct, the amount  is about $3,681.  That is the gap.  I point out, again, for a family of  three, with one breadwinner—say with  a father who is at the minimum wage— that family of three will find itself, on  average, over a year’s  time, about  $3,600 of income less than the Federal  poverty level. That family is living in  poverty even though the breadwinner  of that family is working full time.  And it gets worse, as you might expect.  Let’s take a family of four, say a father and a mother, and two children.  Say one parent is working full time at  a minimum wage job. Because the increase in the minimum wage has been  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:44 Mar 31, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G30MR6.077 S30PT1 ",2004

532,139,2004-03-30,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, we are  currently  discussing  plans  both  for  later tonight and tomorrow and the  next 2 weeks. I had the opportunity to  talk to the Democratic leader, and that  discussion will go on for a while. While  we are in, and have been in a quorum  call, I wanted to take the opportunity  to address an issue that has to do with  gasoline prices, energy policy, something that every single American who  drives or benefits from driving is feeling; that is, the price at the gasoline  pump.  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was in the news this morning expressing his concern about rising  gasoline prices. He is right to be concerned. We are all concerned. But what  he should be concerned about is his  own dismal record in terms of addressing this very issue. Again and again, he  has taken positions that result not in  what Americans want—that is, lower  gas prices—but again and again in his  position as a Senator and before, he  has been on the other side and engaged  in policies and supporting policies that  drive the price of gasoline higher and  higher.  The Senate  record  is  familiar  to  most, but in 1983, when he was Lieutenant Governor  in Massachusetts,  the  Dukakis-Kerry  administration  supported a $50 million gas tax hike on the  citizens of Massachusetts. In 1993, in  the Senate, he voted for the largest tax  increase in American history, the Clinton tax bill, which increased the Federal gasoline tax by 4.3 cents. He also  voted twice for the Clinton-Gore Btu  tax which, had it been signed into law,  would have increased gas taxes by another 7.5 cents per gallon.  The following year he backed a 50cent  increase  in the gas tax  for all  Americans. He wrote a letter at that  time to the Boston Globe expressing  his disappointment that a scorecard  issued by a deficit reduction organization in Washington did not accurately  reflect his support for this half-dollar  gas tax increase.  The list goes on. The Senator from  Massachusetts also wants the United  States to accept the Kyoto Protocol  which, according to Wharton Economic  Forecasting Associates, would  raise  gasoline prices an additional 65 cents  per gallon. And just last year, Senator  KERRYvoted for climate change legislation which would have  imposed a  Kyoto-style regulation on 80 percent of  the U.S.  economy  and would have  raised gasoline prices by 40 cents a gallon.  That is a little bit of the history and  the background for this new concern  about gasoline prices by the Senator  from Massachusetts, ",2004
533,139,2004-03-30,Mr. KERRY.,"  Put aside a moment the impact that  these proposals would have had on an  issue that we have talked a lot about  on the floor today, and that is jobs and  the  importance of  job creation. The  most immediate impact, the most immediate result of Senator KERRY’s positions would be to  force America’s  consumers to pay at  least a dollar  more for each gallon of gasoline they  purchase, and that is a conservative estimate.  It is also worth noting that Senator  KERRYhas consistently opposed any increase in domestic production of energy and any proposal that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The  Energy bill, which we all know fell two  votes short in the Senate last year, is  probably  the most  recent  example.  Senator KERRY has expressed opposition to this measure, although he was  not present in the Senate when we cast  that critical vote on the conference report.  In opposing the Energy bill, Senator  KERRYis opposing not just the creation  of 800,000 new jobs, he is opposing the  development  of  new  domestic  resources, new resources that come in  the United  States,  including  such  things as renewable resources such as  wind and solar energy. To that you  could add clean burning ethanol, and to  that you could add advanced coal technology or zero emission nuclear energy  and, yes, the development of domestic  oil and gas resources as well.  I come to the floor to mention all of  this, especially mentioning his record  on the floor of the Senate, because it is  simply very difficult to take seriously  Senator KERRYwhen he says he is concerned about high gas prices and then  blames others for not having addressed  them. Throughout his career, Senator  KERRYhas consistently taken positions  that will result  in even higher gas  prices and lower domestic supplies of  energy and jobs lost.  If the Senator from Massachusetts,  indeed, wants to engage in a serious  discussion about energy policy, I ask  that he come back to the Senate and  help us do what we should be doing,  and that is pass an Energy bill which  he and his party unfortunately have  been blocking for months.  I appreciate the opportunity to review the record since we had this available  time.  I  do  challenge Senator  KERRY to engage in a serious discussion about helping us pass that very  policy which we know would lower gasoline prices in the United States.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2004

This Chamber, given some of the dialog—and especially the dialog I heard a  few minutes ago—only lacks the balloons, the buttons, and the brass band  for being a political convention in a  full-scale support of a candidate in a  Presidential operation, a Presidential  campaign.  It is not my desire nor my intent to  talk about the Presidential race. But  when I hear people come to the floor  and decide to talk about JOHNKERRY’s  record on energy as a Member of the  Senate, I think it is important to respond.  There are a great many allegations  being  made  about  Senator  KERRY’s record and many—most that I  have heard  recently—have been  flat  out untrue,  just wrong.

538,153,2004-03-30,Mr. DEWINE.," Mr. President, today  we have an opportunity to reach out to  the  least developed  country  in  the  Western Hemisphere—we have an opportunity to reach out to the island nation of Haiti.  I  am  pleased  to  join  Senators  of Florida, LUGAR, BAUCUS,  GRAHAM CHAFEE, DODD, VOINOVICH, and NELSON  of Florida in introducing the Haiti Economic Opportunity Act of 2004. I also  would  like  to  thank Representative  SHAW, as well as our other House cosponsors, for their support of this bill.  Our bill would use trade incentives to  encourage  the  post-Aristide  government to make much needed reforms,  while encouraging  foreign direct  investment—the most powerful, and yet  underutilized, tool of development. The  bill’s provisions apply the least developed country provisions of the African  Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, to  Haiti—the least developed country in  our Hemisphere.  Specifically, our bill would provide  duty-free entry to apparel articles assembled in Haiti contingent upon Presidential certification that the new government  is making significant political, economic, and social reforms. The  bill also caps the amount of duty-free  articles at  1.5 percent of  the  total  amount of U.S. apparel imports, growing to 3.5 percent over 7 years. Currently, Haiti accounts  for  less than  one-half of 1 percent of all U.S. apparel  imports, and although these provisions  seem modest by U.S.  standards,  in  Haiti they are substantial.  The  enactment of  this  legislation  would promote employment in Haitian  industry by allowing Haiti to become a  garment production center again. Haiti  has a labor advantage that makes it  competitive compared to other countries in the region, and at one time several years ago over 100,000 people were  employed in assembly jobs. Now, that  number stands at just 30,000, and regional and global economic conditions  are quickly converging to eliminate  any chance of Haiti reestablishing a  foothold  in  the garment production  market.  Our window of opportunity to act expires at the end of the year, when  quotas are phased out of the global  market for textiles and apparel, and  countries, such as China, are allowed  to fully enter the market. In addition,  Haiti has been largely left out of the  Central American Free-Trade Agreement negotiations, gaining only small  concessions for coproduction with the  Dominican Republic. These concessions  are necessary but far from sufficient  for creating jobs.  I have traveled to Haiti 13 times, and  there is no doubt that Haiti needs this  opportunity. No other nation  in our  hemisphere is as impoverished. Today,  at least 80 percent of all Haitians live  in abject poverty, with at least 80 percent under- or unemployed. Per capita  annual income is less than $400.  No other nation in our hemisphere  has a higher rate of HIV/AIDS. Today,  AIDS is the No. 1 cause of all adult  deaths in Haiti, killing at least 30,000  Haitians  annually  and  orphaning  200,000 children.  No other nation in our hemisphere  has a higher infant mortality rate or a  lower life expectancy rate.  And, no other nation in our hemisphere is as environmentally strapped.  Haiti is an ecological disaster, with a  98-percent deforestation level and extreme topsoil erosion.  Despite  this, U.S.  assistance  has  reached its lowest level in over a decade. This needs to change. Haiti is in  our backyard, inexorably linked to the  United States by history, geography,  humanitarian concerns, the illicit drug  trade, and the ever-present possibility  of waves of incoming refugees. Haiti’s  problems are our problems.  In an environment such as this, foreign assistance is not enough to create  economic opportunities, promote development, and reverse these dire conditions. Economic development is the  answer, bringing with it lower unemployment, increased infrastructure development, and spillover effects for the  rest of Haiti’s population.  This bill is not the ‘‘silver bullet’’ for  Haiti, because there is no silver bullet.  Rebuilding Haiti  is going to require  time, attention, and determination on  the part of the people of Haiti, the  countries in the region, and ultimately  the entire  international community.  This bill would be a powerful indicator  that Haiti has the support necessary to  move forward. I encourage all of my  colleagues to cosponsor this important  piece of legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 2261  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

However, due to our Nation’s budget being  in the red, it is bothersome that we can not  feed more of our Nation’s children whose parents are hard working Americans. It is bothersome  that  there are children whose  families  can not even afford the reduced price meals  but are simply not poor enough to receive free  lunch. With over 500 school boards and many  state boards of education urging Congress to  eliminate the reduced price charge—Congress  has replied with ‘‘we just can not afford to help  your children eat’’.  It is also bothersome that some in Congress  feel that it is inappropriate to recommend what  foods are healthy and should be given to students and what unhealthy  foods should be  kept off the menu. The argument is why would  schools attempt to provide healthy foods when  students can simply get the unhealthy foods  outside of school. Should our schools begin to  give up on a student in the 9th or 10th grade  because  neither  parent  graduated  high  school? Should our schools not teach a student to read because neither parent is literate  nor does  the home provides newspapers or  books to read? Should our schools not teach  algebra, geometry, or calculus because  the  parent can only do simply math with a calculator?  Our schools have been the stepping stone  to a better life for many individuals than the  life of which their parents had academically,  socially, emotionally and  there  is no reason  why nutritionally can not be added to the list.  Mr. Speaker, I supported this reauthorization  last week—but only wish we could have done  more to prevent more children from going hungry. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

541,174,2004-03-30,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to  pay tribute today to John Rino for his admirable service and dedication  to his Trinidad,  Colorado community. His volunteer efforts for  Trinidad seniors were recently recognized at  the Harry R. Sayre Senior Center where a  new wing was dedicated in his name. I would  like  to congratulate John on  receiving  this  honor and thank him for his unwavering commitment to the City of Trinidad and the State  of Colorado.  An active member  in  city politics,  John  served on the Trinidad city council for sixteen  years, and served  for  two  terms as mayor.  During his years in public service, John was  instrumental  in making  significant  improvements  to  the city. He organized  the county  ambulance district, saw that neglected streets  were paved, saw  that wooden water  transmission lines were replaced with metal lines,  and extended water lines to areas of the city  that were not previously provided with city  water. For  the  last sixteen years, John has  volunteered his  time with  the senior citizen  center, organizing and cooking spaghetti dinner fund-raisers that usually have 150 or more  people in attendance.  Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that John Rino  is a person who possesses dedication and  commitment  to his pursuit of public service,  and it is my distinct pleasure to honor John  before this body of Congress and this nation  today. Naming the new wing after John is the  center’s way of saying thanks for his selfless  efforts and leadership, and is a well-deserved  testament to his ongoing efforts to better his  community. I wish John all the best in his future endeavors. LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM TREA  SENIOR CITIZENS LEAGUE  HON. GENE TAYLOR  OFMISSISSIPPI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 30, 2004 ",2004
542,174,2004-03-30,Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, in  January I introduced H.J. Res. 88, a bill proposing a Constitutional amendment  to make  the Social Security trust funds, the Medicare  trust funds, the military retirement trust fund,  and the civil service retirement trust fund offbudget so that the annual budget deficit will  reflect the true costs of the obligations that accrue each year.  My bill has been endorsed by  the TREA  Senior Citizens League, an affiliate of The Retired Enlisted Association. I would like to insert  the  letter of support  from George A. Smith,  Chairman of TREA Senior Citizens League  into the RECORD: JANUARY15, 2004.  Hon. GENETAYLOR Rayburn House Office Building,  Washington, DC.  DEARCONGRESSMANTAYLOR: TSCL, a nonpartisan advocacy organization consisting of  some 1.2 million members and supporters nationwide, understands that you intend to reintroduce a constitutional amendment resolution  that would  lock Social Security,  Medicare  and military  retirement  trust  funds off budget. On behalf of our members  and supporters, I want to convey our strong  support for your resolution.  Contrary to popular belief, Social Security  and other trust fund monies are not kept  separate from other government funds. The  government uses those monies when it needs  to, and simply writes an IOU to the trust  fund. I believe the American people would be  outraged if they truly understood this was  happening.  Also, because of the way the government  counts the surpluses that we have in the various trust funds, the deficit appears to be  less than it really is. Once again, I believe if  the American people would see the true size  of the deficit, there would be an end to business as usual in Washington. As Comptroller  General David Walker said in a September  2003 speech, ‘‘‘while we are starting off in a  financial hole, we don’t really have a very  good picture of how deep it is’’ because the  Congressional Budget Office and the Office of  Management and Budget’s current measurement and scorekeeping approaches relay an  incomplete and misleading picture of the  government’s  financial  condition.’’  [Roll  Call, September 18, 2003]  TSCL also applauds the approach you are  taking  by  introducing  a  constitutional  amendment resolution.  If  legislation only  were to be enacted, we believe that Congress  and the White House would ignore or work  around the law. This is why it is imperative  that a constitutional amendment be ratified.  TSCL’s parent organization is The Retired  Enlisted Association. As such, we are especially grateful for the protections you seek  not only for Social Security and Medicare  trust funds, but also for the military retirement and disability trust fund.  Please be assured, Rep. Taylor, that we  will be doing whatever we can do to move  this resolution forward. Again, thank you for  your efforts. We look forward to working  with you on this critical matter.  Warm Regards,  GEORGEA. SMITH,  Chairman.

543,181,2004-03-30,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  give recognition to three members of the ‘‘Coalition of  the Willing’’—Latvia, Estonia, and  Lithuania.  These Baltic nations have answered the call  to freedom. The people of Latvia, Estonia, and  Lithuania should feel very proud of the effort  their governments have given to the rebuilding  of  Iraq and during Operation  Iraqi Freedom.  They have troops deployed in Iraq and these  men and women are putting their lives on the  line in the fight for freedom and democracy. In  fact Latvia has deployed 150 soldiers, Estonia  55, and Lithuania 85. The sacrifice they are  making should not be taken lightly.  These countries understand what  freedom  is, and what it takes to ensure it. I wish more  countries had the same sense of duty and responsibility as these three nations. When the  future  is written, what  they have done and  sacrificed will not be forgotten. I applaud all of  their efforts and I am very proud of what they  have accomplished. The Coalition of the Willing has been criticized as being ‘‘token allies’’  and  claims of ulterior motives have been  made. I for one don’t believe any of this and  I am glad these countries have joined our efforts. This is a fight worth fighting, and I salute  our friends from Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO LARRY  EDWARD PENLEY  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 30, 2004 ",2004
544,181,2004-03-30,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker it is with great  pride that I rise today to pay tribute to one of  our  nation’s  top  educators.  Larry Edward  Penley will be  inaugurated  in  the  coming  weeks as the President of Colorado State University, and with his  rich academic background, the students of Colorado will be well  served. Larry has been improving the lives of  American students for years, and I would like  to  join my colleagues here  today  in  recognizing his tremendous service to the Colorado  community and this nation.  Larry received both his bachelor’s degree in  psychology and his master’s degree in communication  from Wake Forest University before completing his doctorate in Management  at the University of Georgia. Following graduate school Larry joined the faculty at the University of Texas at San Antonio where he  eventually served as associate dean of  the  College of Business.  In 1991, he was appointed as dean of  the Arizona State W.P.  Carey School of Business which he saw become one of the nation’s most prominent business schools.  Larry is a well-rounded academic who has  been  involved with  several  community  improvement organizations like the United Way  and the Arizona Coalition for Tomorrow. His  research has  focused on effective management skills and he is published in several of  the nation’s top academic journals. In addition  to his service  to  the University and multiple  associations he has consulted for, Larry has  been awarded several honors, such as  the  MBA Students Associations Lifetime Achievement Award and the Hispanic Business Students Association Century Award  for Exemplary Support  and  Leadership.  Larry  has  raised millions of dollars for Arizona State University as he revised the curriculum to include  more technology and actively recruited a diverse range of  the nation’s  top high school  students.  Mr. Speaker, Larry Edward Penley is a dedicated, selfless person who has been a wonderful ambassador for education in our country, and I am honored to welcome him to the  Colorado academic community. His passion  for public service is an outstanding example to  set for America’s youth, and his enthusiasm  and commitment certainly deserve  the  recognition of this body of Congress and this nation. Congratulations on your new position,  and keep up the good work! f  CONGRATULATING  ALEXANDRA  HOLDERMAN  AND  KARVA  VAIDYANATHAN FOR THEIR EXEMPLARY VOLUNTEER SERVICE  HON.

Mr. Speaker, by taking up the Continuity  in Representation Act  this  week, the House will not only address a  glaring deficiency in Federal law, it  will also make an unequivocal statement about America’s national resolve  on the war on terror.  None of us in this Chamber or in this  Nation wants to think of a scenario  that would compel the Speaker to invoke this legislation, but such are the  responsibilities of  leadership  in  the  post-9/11 world.  The bill will therefore put in place a  process by which Congress can quickly  reconstitute itself after a catastrophic  event. If such an event occurs and an  extreme number of resulting vacancies  threaten  the  continuity of  congressional  activity,  the  Speaker may,  under this legislation, order States to  call special elections to fill those vacancies within 45 days.  By passing this legislation, we will  guarantee the failure of any terrorist  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

558,22,2004-04-20,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. Speaker, the people  of South Carolina are well served by  the gentleman  from South Carolina  (Mr. SPRATT) for the clarity that he  brings to this debate on the budget, a  far cry, I might say, from what our  friends on the majority side of the aisle  have been doing.  When we start talking about PAYGO  rules, it may sound technical and difficult to understand, but it really is  not: pay as you go. It is very simple.  Everyone should be able to get this.  The rules that were in effect from  1990 to 2002 provided if a Member of  Congress wanted to increase spending  on a certain item, then he would have  to decrease spending on another item  or have a tax increase to pay for what  he wanted to do. If, on the other hand,  a Member of Congress wanted to propose a tax cut, he would have to at the  same time reduce spending or he would  have to increase some other form of  taxes. Very simple, pay as you go.  It should not be hard, but the Republicans here have done something quite  astonishing. They used to claim they  were fiscal conservatives, and they still  do, but they clearly are not because  they have forgotten the basic connection between expenditures and revenues, between money coming in and  money  going  out. Every American  knows this relationship. In our personal budgets, we have money coming  in and we have money going out. The  money that we spend on things, they  have to be in balance, or we wind up in  great  trouble. Everyone who has a  business of any size knows you have  money coming in and you have money  going out, and they have to be in balance.  Only here in Washington does the Republican majority suggest that the revenues, the money coming in, do not  matter. You do not even have to think  about that; all you have to focus on is  spending. The gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. SPRATT) has a chart that  shows that spending as a percentage of  our gross domestic product actually remains low compared to the past; but it  is receipts, tax revenues, that have declined so dramatically.  ",2004
559,22,2004-04-20,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, this is a  bit difficult to follow, but once you understand it, it is a very graphic chart.  Basically what this shows is in the  red line at the top is a course of outlays from the 1980s through the current  period, 2004. What Members see here is  when President Clinton came to office  in 1992–1993, spending was at 22.5 percent of our gross domestic product.  Federal spending constituted 22.5 percent of our GDP. That is about the  point at which President Clinton came  to office, and this may be a surprise to  some people, but because of budget discipline, because of PAYGO, because of  the discretionary spending caps, two  different budget plans in 1993 and 1997,  every year outlays came down. At the  same time, we enhanced revenues. That  is the politically polite way to put it.  We increased the revenues to the government. They came up.

It puts  them at greater risk. This problem can  be solved much more quickly than the  Pentagon is willing to solve it.

562,36,2004-04-20,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  ABERCROMBIE) said, yes, we have had  many conversations about Social Security including the stealing of the extra  trust fund surplus that has been coming in.

As one can  see, the aura that he exudes when he  comes to speak about Social Security  must have been so powerful that the  rays literally leapt out and said to me,  say that the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. SMITH) is coming.  ",2004
564,36,2004-04-20,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, I think that the people of Hawaii  are still wide awake and listening to  this debate.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to comment  tonight not only on Social Security  but what I consider a huge challenge  for this country, and that  is going  deeper  into debt and  increasing the  spending of the Federal Government  and sacrificing the increased burdens of  that increasing debt in addition to the  kind of high taxes that it takes to accommodate this kind of spending and  this kind of servicing of the debt.  The first chart I have is a pie chart  that I wanted to sort of show how the  Federal Government  is spending $2.4  trillion. And we see the largest piece of  this pie is Social Security, spending 21  percent of all Federal spending; and  that is going up.  In 1983 we had the Greenspan Commission that gathered together because  Social Security was going broke, and  what they decided is to dramatically  increase taxes, payroll taxes, our FICA  taxes, for Social Security and at the  same time reduce benefits. And that is  the challenge for Social Security, that  is the challenge for Medicare, that is  certainly the challenge for Medicaid,  the three major programs where Members of Congress have continued  to  make promises over and above far beyond our ability to pay for them in the  future. And that is the problem with  extra pressure on increasing taxes and  increasing debt on these kind of unfunded liabilities.  We see the other pieces of the pie.  Defense is 20 percent; 2 years ago it was  19 percent.  Interest. Look at this issue of interest on the debt. It is now 14 percent of  total spending. Within 6 to 8 years that  amount of the piece of pie that interest  consumes servicing this increasing national debt is probably going to double.  Now, interest rates right now are almost at record lows. We know that interest rates eventually are going to increase. And so increasing interest rates  VerDate mar 24 2004  03:41 Apr 21, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20AP7.077 H20PT1 ",2004

631,50,2004-04-20,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, there will  no  doubt  be  constructive  proposals  from Senators on both sides of the aisle  to refine and improve this bill. That is  what  the amendment process  is all  about.  I encourage this process. It  is my  hope the process will be constructive  and it will result in a bill that can pass  this body. I look forward to the debate  and consideration of S. 1125.  I yield the floor.  EXHIBIT1  S. 2290—SUMMARYOFCHANGESFROMS. 1125  ASREPORTED  S. 1125, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury  Resolution Act, as reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, represents an unprecedented advance on complex and difficult issues that have stalled previous attempts  at  similar  legislation. Landmark  agreements were reached on asbestos injury  compensation  issues such as medical criteria, and over 50 consensus-building changes  were adopted overall. Nonetheless, a number  of issues were left open for further discussion, and additional concerns were raised  that were not addressed by the Committee.  Since the bill was reported out of Committee, various stakeholders and members  from both parties have continued negotiations. The substitute bill being introduced  reflects agreements on some of these difficult issues reached during these negotiations, and attempts to address a number of  concerns that have been raised but have not  yet been subject of agreement. In particular,  the First/Hatch bill: raises claims values,  creates a more streamlined administrative  system that can be up and running quickly,  provides  increased  liquidity  and  upfront  funding so that claims can be paid in short  order, and places the risk that the Fund runs  out of money on the defendants and insurers  and not on the claimants. These are just  some highlights of the numerous changes  that were made to make a fairer system for  claimants. The following provides a section-  by-section summary of the changes in the  First/Hatch bill from S. 1125 as reported with  explanations as to the need for the changes.  SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS  Changes were made to various definitions  under this section to conform with other  amendments in the bill to provide clarifications.  Sec. 3(3) Definition of ‘‘asbestos claim.’’ S.  1125 seeks to replace the current broken tort  system with a streamlined, administrative  system. S. 1125, therefore, must preempt and  supersede all asbestos claims filed in the current tort system. Concerns were raised that  the definition of ‘‘asbestos claim’’ in S. 1125  as reported may have been interpreted as unduly limited, failing to cover some types of  asbestos claims that are currently overburdening the tort system today, which were intended to be preempted and superseded by  the Act. This definition was amended to help  ensure  that  the definition  is  interpreted  broadly to encompass all types of claims  that are being filed in the system today.  This definition has also been amended to  make clear that claims alleging damage to  tangible property are left intact.  [Sec. 3(6) Definition of ‘‘collateral source  compensation.’’ The disease categories under  S. 1125 are not easily translatable from those  filed in the tort system. The definition of  ‘‘collateral source compensation,’’ therefore,  was clarified  to more clearly encompass  awards in the tort system.]  Sec. 3(9) Definition of ‘‘insurance receivership proceeding.’’ A new definition for ‘‘insurance receivership proceedings’’ was added  to S.  1125. This  definition  accompanies  changes made to section 402 that would give  the Fund a priority for collection of assessments from insurers in state insurance receivership  proceedings.  These  provisions  track those provided for insolvent companies  in bankruptcy. This definition describes the  state law proceedings to which the priority  applies. This,  like  the bankruptcy provisions, help  to ensure  that  the payments  made to the Fund are continued despite any  subsequent  insolvencies of  insurer participants.  [Sec. 3(11) Definition of ‘‘participant.’’ One  of the exceptions to ‘‘participant,’’ defined in  section 3(11), are companies who have completed their bankruptcy proceedings. This  exception was amended to ensure that the  bill  is  in concert with the United States  Bankruptcy Code. A company is not ‘‘out of  bankruptcy’’ until the plan of reorganization  becomes effective  in accordance with  its  terms. Under the Bankruptcy Code, changes  to the plan can occur until the date on which  the plan is ‘‘substantially consummated,’’ as  defined in section 1101(2) of that Code. Conforming changes were made to applicable  sections in the funding provisions under title  II.]  TITLEI—ASBESTOSCLAIMSRESOLUTION  Subtitle A—Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation  The Frist/Hatch bill incorporates a new administrative structure for the processing and  VerDate mar 24 2004  23:38 Apr 20, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A20AP6.007 S20PT1 ",2004
632,57,2004-04-20,Mr. DASCHLE.," I am pleased the majority leader came back to the floor to  reiterate his desire to find a solution.  It will take more than just reasserting  over and over that we want to find that  answer, that compromise, that legislative approach that will generate the  kind of support in the Senate that is  possible.  It takes what he just said. It will  take a willingness to meet, a willingness  to work  through  these  issues.  That is my frustration. I truly believe  the majority leader is sincere when he  says he wants to find a way to solve  the problem.  What I don’t feel has been done, except in the offices of the good Senator  from Pennsylvania, is that concerted  effort to try to address these issues in  an inclusive way. That has been done,  but it has been done in large measure  by Senator SPECTER, not by the leadership.  We are prepared today, tomorrow, tonight. We will be happy to meet, as I  have offered to do on many occasions.  The sooner we do it, the sooner that  opportunity  for  resolution  can  be  achieved.  I yield the floor.  ",2004
633,57,2004-04-20,Mr. FRIST.," If the Democratic leader  will yield for a question, if we start  right now and we work through today,  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday on  issues we debated and talked about—a  lot of people are a lot more expert than  me—why can’t we do that? Why can’t  we resolve this huge problem? If we  send it off to never-never land for an  unlimited period of time, this will not  come back. I know that. This is the  fourth date I have set as a final date  that we will come in just for consideration, so we can get on the bill. Even if  we were on the bill, talking about the  merits of the bill, debating it, we can  be having discussions with Democrats  and Republicans. I ask that Senator  LEAHY and Senator HATCH also be in  the room as well.  Now is the time. Now is the time for  action. Would that be possible?  ",2004
634,57,2004-04-20,Mr. DASCHLE.," If the Senator is asking me a question, I respond by saying,  absolutely. But let me give him one illustration of my skepticism about his  question.  There must have been now, as he  said, 20—maybe more—staff meetings  over  the course of  the  last  6 or  8  months. As he and  I discussed this  matter and as our staffs discussed this  matter, attention has turned to the  compensation trust fund. We were absolutely  startled,  surprised,  deeply  troubled by this remarkable movement  away from the trust fund number the  committee had included: $153 billion.  The pending bill has $109 billion.  My staff and I have both asked staff  of the majority leader on several occasions, Is there a way to find a reasonable  number?  We  have  been  stonewalled every  single  time when  that issue has been discussed. It has  even  not been discussed.  It  is not  discussable on the other side.  It does not do any good to sit and  look across each other at the table if  we cannot have a meaningful discussion about some of the differences we  have. If all we do over the course of the  next week is to say this is our number,  with some expectation that maybe by  saying it 100 times we will concede that  then has to be the number, this will be  one of the most fruitless experiences he  and I will have had in our time in the  Senate.  So yes, there has to be a willingness  to meet; but if those meetings have  meaning, there also has to be willingness to negotiate. Frankly, we have  not seen much of that except in the  Specter meetings. Again, I am hopeful  we can finally move off these hard positions and find some common ground. If  that can be achieved, then, yes, I think  this week could be a productive week.  ",2004

He  and I will talk, the leadership will talk,  and talk to the relative parties over  the course of the day.

643,64,2004-04-20,Mrs. DOLE.," Mr. President, I want to  address the repeated attacks towards  the Bush administration’s role in Iraq.  Yesterday, one critic claimed that our  unilateral policy in Iraq has steadily  drifted  from tragedy to tragedy and  made America less safe. The very mention of Iraq and the current situation  there incites what I have begun to call  the ‘‘liberal naysayers’’ to launch into  steady  streams  of  empty  rhetoric  against our plans  in Iraq. Just this  week these critics said that our troops  are paying the price for flawed policy.  These brazenly political claims have no  basis,  in  fact, and serve no purpose  other than to undermine the administration in a time of war.  In liberating Iraq, we have rid the nation and the rest of the world from the  danger of Saddam Hussein. 46 of the 55  of his most wanted regime members  have been captured or killed. In removing this tyrant from power and undermining his regime, we have brought  about increased security in a nation  that at one time barely comprehended  the term. Today, over 150,000 Iraqis, including 75,000 new police personnel, are  protecting the Iraqi people. Recently  the Iraqi Governing Council signed the  Transitional Administrative Law.

644,78,2004-04-20,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Where we have  made some changes—and I would suggest them—is in the second class, raising the Hatch-Frist values from $20,000  to $25,000; in class III, raising the values  for  asbestosis/pleural  disease B  from $85,000 to $100,000;  in class VI,  other cancers, going from $150,000 to  $200,000;  in  class VII,  giving  nonsmokers with 15 years weighted exposure a range of $225,000 to $650,000—that  is $50,000 more than in the Hatch-Frist  proposal;  in class VIII,  lung cancer  with  pleural  disease,  giving  nonsmokers a range of $600,000 to $1.1 million—a $100,000 increase; in class IX,  giving nonsmokers a range of $800,000  to $1.1 million a $100,000 increase; and  for mesothelioma, the last category, a  $1.1 million average award on a sliding  scale.  These numbers have been  run by  Goldman Sachs. They total $123.6 billion, as opposed to the $114.4 estimated  for the Hatch-Frist proposal.  Because I have not been party directly to any of the discussion, regretfully, the only way I can get my views  through,  it appears,  is  through  the  floor of the Senate. I believe this is  much more fair to nonsmokers and I  believe the methodology of giving the  trust administrator the ability that, if  nonsmoker cases rise above a certain  percent in the next year, at the end of  the previous year the administrator be  given the power to put all of those  cases into the tort system which will  not only act as a deterrent, but will  also provide the ability to fund this.  One other point I want to make before I yield the floor has to do with the  CBO letter.

653,99,2004-04-20,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, I rise to  congratulate  the  Drury  University  Lady Panthers  basketball  team  on  their fantastic march to the NCAA Division II championship game in St. Joseph, MO, on March 27, 2004. Fans and  alumni  in Southwest Missouri  and  across  the  country  are  justifiably  proud of the Lady Panthers.  For years fans from the great State  of Missouri  have  enjoyed watching  some of America’s most outstanding  sports legends. The Lady Panthers are  continuing this tradition of excellence,  ending  their year with an enviable  record of 36–2. In an amazing performance, the Drury team battled until the  end for the NCAA Division II National  Championship. In the words of Coach  Nyla Milleson,  it was a tremendous  journey.  What makes this story remarkable is  the fact that the Lady Panthers basketball team was established  just 4  years ago under the direction of the  late Dr. Bruce Harger, Drury’s athletic  director for 15 years. Many teams work  for years to gain preeminence and respect in their sport. Thanks to the brilliant coaching of Nyla Milleson and her  staff, along with  the  team’s  strong  commitment and hard work, the Lady  Panthers were able to achieve this distinction in a very short time.  Coach Milleson skillfully assembled a  group of talented young women, many  from southwest Missouri where basketball takes center stage in most communities during the winter months. The  women’s team played their first game  in 2000, joining a Drury men’s team  that is rich in tradition. With strong  support  from the University and  its  boosters, the Lady Panthers enjoyed  immediate  success,  culminating  in  their  championship  appearance  this  March.  Long known  for academics, Drury  University can now add women’s basketball to its list of nationally recognized sports programs, continuing its  tradition of excellence. There  is no  doubt that the Drury Lady Panthers  are poised to compete in many more  games. I congratulate Coach Milleson  and all the Lady Panthers team members,  coaches  and  supporters  who  worked hard to turn their dreams into  reality.∑  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.

654,99,2004-04-20,Mr.  BUNNING.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to take a moment today to  pay tribute to Mr. Tom DiBello of Covington, KY who has served with great  distinction as the Executive Director  of the Covington Community Center  since 1995.  Tom has strong roots in Covington,  KY, even though he first came to the  community as a 1-year VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, worker.  Mr. DiBello  then worked  his way  through the Covington Community as  an outreach worker, community organizer and program director. As he rose  through the ranks, his dedication to  the community and  list of achievements only grew.  Some of Mr. DiBello’s early accomplishments  include organizing grassroots efforts for welfare reform and developing the Covington Neighborhood  Action Coalition, now known as the  Covington Neighborhood Collaborative.  Mr. DiBello is responsible for marked  growth  of  the  Community  Center,  transforming it from a small organization on the west side of Covington to a  truly city-wide support and development organization. From developing  partnerships to running a capital campaign, Tom’s leadership has been integral to the success of the Covington  Community Center.  Congratulations again, Mr. DiBello,  on your dedicated service to the Covington Community Center. You are an  inspiration for all of us throughout the  Commonwealth of Kentucky. We look  forward to your continued success and  achievement.∑  RECOGNIZING  THE  CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALEC BRINDLE  ∑",2004
655,99,2004-04-20,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  would like to take a few minutes to  offer a tribute to a very significant figure in one of my State’s largest industries: seafood processing. This man is  Alec Brindle, who was for many years  with Wards Cove Packing Company,  and who has now entered retirement.  In addition to having played an important role in the development of Alaska’s salmon  industry, Alec has also  been a friend of mine, and of my family, for many years. It seems to me  that anyone with the stamina and perseverance to work in the fish business  for 50 years deserves some recognition.  Although Alec was born in the Seattle area, his life has long been tied to  Alaska’s  fisheries. Almost his entire  extended family has been involved in  Alaskan  fisheries  since well  before  Alaskan statehood. As a young boy he  spent summers in Ketchikan, at first  playing around the cannery, and then,  at age 13, he began his career as an employee of the family salmon packing  operation. This was the beginning of a  career, and a commitment, that would  last for 50 years. Alec is one of those  people about whom you can say, ‘‘He  has truly seen it all’’. At various points  in his long career fish prices for red  salmon have varied  from pennies a  pound to a point in the late 1980’s when  a single fish was worth more than a  barrel of North Slope crude oil. As Alec  himself has pointed out, the fish business is one where at the beginning of  the season the processor doesn’t know  how much fish he will be able to buy,  what price he will pay, or at what price  he will be able to sell the finished product. Needless to say, trying to craft  and maintain a business plan under  such circumstances is not an easy task.  But Alec, to his great credit, was able  to maintain his grace and charm in the  face of all these challenges. He was a  true gentleman in a very tough business.  Alec did take enough time off from  the family business to obtain a law degree. He spent a year clerking for well  known Alaska Supreme Court Justice  John Dimond. Since Alaska had only  recently been granted statehood, these  were  exciting  times  for  our young  State as we sorted through the growing  pains of creating a judicial system. As  a young attorney Alec contributed to  this process.  Most people outside of Alaska aren’t  aware that the  fishing  industry has  traditionally been my State’s largest  private  employer. Each year,  thousands of fishermen and other workers  come to Alaska to help  in the harvesting and processing of the amazing  variety  of  fishery  resources  of my  State. Although most of Alec’s career  was spent in the salmon business, he  and his family have also been involved  in the crab, herring and groundfish sectors. Many fishermen and processing  workers have spent their entire careers  enjoying an association with Alec and  other members of the Brindle family.

Dr.  Habermehl has unselfishly donated his  time  and medical expertise to educating the underserved on maintaining good eye health. On  Thursday, April 22, 2004,  the Burton Rotary  Club during their monthly meeting will present  Dr. Habermehl with  the  prestigious  Jack  Hamady Good Scout award  for outstanding  community service.  Dr. Habermehl was born and raised in Burton, Michigan. He graduated  in 1981  from  Bentley High School. He attended Ferris State  University, after which he enrolled in the Illinois College of Optometry. Upon graduation in  1988 he joined the private group of Dr. Thomas Pardee and Dr. David Visser, where he  began his primary eye care practice. His practice has flourished into one of the most well  known, and accomplished eye care practices  in Genesee County. On June 27, 1988, he became a member of the Burton Rotary Club,  and  in 1990 he served as President of  the  Club. Dr. Habermehl made history  in 1996,  when he became the youngest Optometrist to  be appointed to the State Board of Examiners  of Optometry. He currently holds the position  of Chairman of the Board until his term expires in June of 2004. Dr. Habermehl shares  his knowledge of maintaining excellent eye  health to not only the residents of Genesee  County,  but  to  the  underserved  populace  around the world. In 2001, he was appointed  Chairman of the Burton Rotary Club’s Avoidable Blindness Committee, and as a result has  led a team of doctors, VOSH volunteers, and  Rotarians to Mexico for the past four years to  dispense used eyeglasses. This effort has led  to the giving of corrected vision to over 10,000  Mexican citizens. Dr. Habermehl  is also actively  involved with  the Michigan Optometric  and the American Optometric Association. He  is the Director of the Flint Sensory Learning  Center, which  is devoted  to aiding children  and adults with developmental delays. Dr.  Habermehl has received numerous accolades  for work, but one that is most worthy of mentioning  for  this occasion  is  the  ‘‘Rotarian of  Year’’ award, which he has been awarded  three  times by  the Burton Rotary Club. Dr.  Habermehl credits the love and support of his  devoted wife Cindy and his two children, Chad  and Kylee to his success.  Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I  ask my colleagues in the 108th Congress to  please  join me  in congratulating a humanitarian, and my good  friend Dr. Bradley E.  Habermehl.

A  reception will be held  in his  honor on April 15th in Fresno, California.  Doug has achieved numerous accomplishments and has been involved in many noteworthy projects. Mr. Harrison has spoken nationally on urban storm water and flood control  issues, including frequent testimony before the  United States Congress and  the California  State Legislature. He has published numerous  articles and was a contributing author for a national water resources policy white paper developed by the National Water Alliance for the  George Bush administration. Doug’s work  in  urban runoff quality research was recognized  by  the American Waterworks Association as  the best water  resources  research effort of  1988. The State Water Resource Control  Board acknowledged Mr. Harrison for Federal  Clean Water Act program assistance, and was  subsequently named by the American Public  Works Association as one of  the Top Ten  Public Works Leaders in the nation in 1993.  Mr. Harrison has received various awards  and recognitions. He was named Manager of  the Year by the California Special Districts Association, and later given the 2002 Excellence  in Water Leadership Award by the Association  of California Water Agencies. During Doug’s  tenure, the Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control  District has been awarded: The Theodore  Roosevelt Environmental Award of the Association of California Water Agencies, Award of  Merit from American City and County Magazine, and the Award of Excellence, California  Park and Recreation Society, to name a few.

Chief Volante was a lifelong resident of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, where he served  as fire chief for 26 years and a firefighter for  50 years. He embodied the most noble virtues  of public service. The Chief served in almost  every position in the fire company since joining the Clifton Heights Hose & Hook in 1954.  Chief Volante will be remembered for his loyal  dedication to improving his community’s ability  to  respond  to emergencies and ensure  the  safety of all residents.  Firefighting is a matter of life and death, and  individuals like Chief Volante assume an enormous responsibility when they accept the job  of running a fire department. They are responsible for the lives, homes, and livelihoods of  thousands of citizens throughout their community. And on a day-to-day basis they become  directly responsible for the health and welfare  of all  the men and women  they supervise.  Chief Volante discharged these enormous responsibilities with real distinction. During his  26 year tenure as chief, a good department  became even better. Chief Volante took great  pride in the fact that his fire company was the  proving grounds  for other companies. Chief  Volante was respected for his commitment to  public safety and his ability to get things done.  Recognizing how difficult it is these days to  recruit volunteers, he had a sign posted outside  the  fire company,  ‘‘Volunteers needed,  apply here.’’ He often said,  ‘‘you can never  have  too many volunteers.’’ The citizens of  Clifton Heights should take comfort that their  fire company will continue  to evoke Chief  Volante’s spirit and legacy through their continued efforts to better their community. When  the alarm sounds at all hours of the day and  night it will serve as a call for more volunteers  to the noble calling of the fire service.  Mr. Speaker, the 7th Congressional District  has lost an exceptional public servant, and I  have lost a good friend. I wish Chief Volante’s  wife of 44 years, Carol Ann and  family, my  heartfelt condolences and may they find comHON. FRANK R.

663,120,2004-04-20,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Rep.  TOMDAVISand myself, it is our pleasure today  to  recognize  the contributions  to community  journalism made by Tom and Betsy Grein  through  their  ownership  of The Observer  newspapers  in  the Herndon  community of  Fairfax County, Virginia. After 13 years at the  helm starting in June 1990—when they bought  The Observer from the late Peggy Vetter, the  newspaper’s founder—the Greins last October  sold the paper to new owners.  Tom and Betsy Grein formed a team dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of  journalism with a focus on providing the community of Herndon with a vital source of information. Tom served as editor and publisher  and Betsy was general manager and advertising director. During  their  tenure, The Observer grew with the community, increasing its  circulation from 14,000 to more than 60,000,  tripling  its  full-time staff, adding editions  in  Loudoun County and Reston, and publishing  electronically on the World Wide Web.  Tom also wrote more than 700 ‘‘Our Town’’  columns,  faithfully documenting his perspective of Herndon and the history and people of  the community.  In addition  to  their  tireless efforts as  the  owners of The Observer, they also found time  to be active members of the Herndon community. Tom served on the Board of Directors of  Herndon Community Television and the Herndon Rotary Club and Betsy was a member of  the Board of Directors of the Herndon Dulles  Chamber of Commerce and  the Council  for  the Arts of Herndon.  We express appreciation to Tom and Betsy  Grein on behalf of all the citizens of the greater Herndon  community  for  their dedicated  service  to  community  journalism and wish  them the best in their future endeavors.  f  REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS ON  THE OCCASION OF THE 89TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN  GENOCIDE  HON. MICHAEL R. McNULTY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 20, 2004  ",2004
664,120,2004-04-20,Mr. MCNULTY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  join  today  with many of my colleagues in remembering  the victims of  the Armenian Genocide. April  24th will be  the 89th anniversary of  this  human tragedy.  From 1915 to 1923, the world witnessed the  first genocide of  the 20th century. This was  clearly one of the world’s greatest tragedies—  the deliberate and systematic Ottoman annihilation of 1.5 million Armenian men, women,  and children. Furthermore, another 500,000  refugees fled and escaped to various points  around  the world—effectively eliminating  the  Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire.  From these ashes arose hope and promise  in 1991—and I was blessed to see it. I was  one of  the  four  international observers  from  the United States Congress to monitor Armenia’s independence referendum. I went to the  communities in the northern part of Armenia,  and I watched in awe as 95 percent of the  people over the age of 18 went out and voted.  The Armenian people had been denied freedom for so many years and, clearly, they were  very excited about  this new opportunity. Almost no one stayed home. They were all out  in  the streets going  to  the polling places.  I  watched in amazement as people stood in line  for hours to get into these small polling places  and vote.  Then, after they voted, the other interesting  thing was that they did not go home. They had  brought covered dishes with them, and all of  these polling places had little banquets afterward to celebrate what had just happened.  What a great thrill it was to join them the  next day in the streets of Yerevan when they  were celebrating  their great victory. Ninety-  eight percent of  the people who voted cast  their ballots in favor of independence. It was  a wonderful experience to be there with them  when  they danced and sang and shouted,  ‘‘Ketse azat ankakh Hayastan’’—long live free  and independent Armenia! That should be the  cry of freedom-loving people everywhere.  f  TRIBUTE TO PROVIDENCE  MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH  HON. DONALD M.

665,120,2004-04-20,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize  Providence  Missionary  Baptist  Church on the occasion of the dedication of  their new church facilities. Founded in Newark  in 1921,  this church has been serving and  ministering to our community for 83 years, and  has long been an institution within my district.  In March of 1921, six families gathered to  establish the Rose Hill Baptist Church, calling  Rev. B.W. Keith as their first pastor. Though  they have moved to various locations around  the city of Newark,  they have continued  to  bless our community through their dedication  to serving each other, as well as their neighbors, through compassionate ministry.  Providence Missionary Baptist Church continues  to  reach beyond  their own parish  to  serve  the citizens of Newark, establishing a  feeding and clothing ministry called Feed My  Sheep, Christian Education and Leadership  training, an Annual Leadership Conference,  and a preschool for the children in the community.  Under the leadership of their current Pastor,  Rev. Vincent Grove, they continue to experience growth, adding new members  to  their  VerDate mar 24 2004  04:31 Apr 21, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20AP8.029 E20PT1 ",2004
666,127,2004-04-20,Mr. WEINER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to  thank the leadership of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee  for  their hard work  shepherding through TEA-LU, a bill that I will  support despite its flaws. The Department of  Transportation studied the Nation’s infrastructure and prescribed a $375 billion solution. I  joined the leadership in endorsing the original  version of this bill, which filled that prescription. Unfortunately, the administration is unwilling to come up with the support necessary to  ensure that we are able to maintain and improve the Nation’s infrastructure. As a result,  we are today considering a bill that does not  do nearly enough to improve the quality of life  for  individuals  living  in New York City and  around the country. I look forward to working  with the Committee leadership to see that this  bill is improved in conference.  Mr. Chairman, as  this bill moves  to conference, I want to highlight four issues that are  of particular import to me and my constituents.  It is my hope that the conferees will include  these improvements in the conference report.  First, this bill should ensure that resources  are devoted by formula to states that require  improvements. The minimum guarantee program shifts funding from states that have the  greatest  need—like  New  York—to  other  states. Each year, New York provides $20 billion more  to Washington  than  it gets back.  New Yorkers ought not be punished for our efforts to conserve fuel, as any expansion of the  minimum guarantee program would do.  Second, this bill shortchanges New York on  transit funding. Despite having a third of the  nation’s transit ridership, New York only gets  14% of Federal funds. Transit funding should  better reflect need.  Third, I hope that conferees will ensure that  states starved for a consistent funding stream  for ferries and waterborne transportation can  count on funding from the Ferry Boat Discretionary Fund. As a  co-chairman, with Mr.  the Ferry and Waterborne  Transportation Caucus, I am acutely aware of  how much a guaranteed stream of  funding  would mean to improve both congestion and  homeland security all across the country, and  particularly in New York City, where roads are  clogged on a normal day, and ferry transportation would provide not only congestion relief  but another way to ensure escape from Manhattan in the case of a terrorist attack. At a  minimum, New York should receive $5 million  per year. I hope conferees will work with me  and other Members who  represent districts  that would benefit  from a guaranteed  ferry  funding stream.  Fourth, I hope that conferees will work with  me  to ensure  that  the generous  funding we  have provided for Senior transportation in this  bill is put to its best use. I believe that establishing a center for best practices and a technical assistance center, as delineated in the  other body’s Surface Transportation Authorization Bill, would provide an enormous service to  this nation’s elderly population.  Nevertheless, Chairman YOUNG, Mr. OBERSTAR, Chairman PETRI, and Mr. LIPINSKI deserve  the  thanks and appreciation of every  Member of this House for their tireless effort to  ensure that the nation’s surface transportation  systems  receive  the  resources  required  to  keep America moving.  Mr. Chairman, I have worked hard to ensure  that this bill will make significant improvements  to the lives of ordinary New Yorkers. Included  NETHERCUTT, of  in this bill are a number of projects that will  enhance transportation throughout New York  City and in my district in particular.  At my urging, the bill includes:  $15,000,000 for the New York City Department of Transportation  to build  the  facilities  and purchase the ferry boats necessary to establish high speed ferry service between the  Rockaway Peninsula and Manhattan.  $500,000 to help the New York State Department of Transportation install two permanent variable message signs that will display  amber alert messages on the belt parkway.  $500,000 for the New York City Department  of Transportation to study and implement improvements to the area surrounding the intersections of Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue.  $1,000,000 for each of the boroughs of New  York City to make improvements to pedestrian  safety,  in  consultation with  each  borough  president.  $250,000 for the areas surrounding each of  10 schools in New York City. Those funds are  to be spent on efforts to improve pedestrian  safety surrounding those 10 schools. Students  walking to IS 114, PS 200, PS 124, PS 277,  Prospect Park Yeshiva, PS 81, IS 194, IS 72/  PS 69, PS 153, and St. Roberts Bellarmine  will all be better protected by improvements installed with funding provided in TEA-LU.  $700,000  to abate noise emanating  from  state roadways located within New York City  that are paved with concrete. ‘‘Diamond grinding’’ measures should significantly improve the  quality of life of those residing within earshot  of those roadways.  $50,000  to  improve  the  roadways  surrounding the Brooklyn Children’s Museum.  $1,000,000 to be used to build a new facility  for the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department.  $4,000,000 to be used by the DOE Fund to  establish  a  graffiti  elimination  program  throughout  the Boroughs  of Queens  and  Brooklyn. Among the areas addressed by this  program will be Kings Highway  from Ocean  Boulevard to McDonald Avenue.  $3,000,000 to improve transportation facilities  in  the vicinity of West 65th Street and  Broadway in conjunction with the major capital  improvements being done at Lincoln Center.  $1,000,000 for the New York City Department of Transportation to improve the streets  and sidewalks of Middle Village, Queens.  $500,000 to be equally distributed at five locations  in New York City  for  the New York  City Department of Transportation to enhance  the enforcement of truck routes.  $300,000 for Gateway National Park to improve the RIIS Park Boardwalk.  $1,000,000  for Gateway National Park  to  establish a  ferry  terminal at Floyd Bennett  Field.  $3,000,000  to be used  to  improve  traffic  flow  in  the vicinity of Atlantic and Flatbush  Avenues.  $1,000,000  to be used by City and State  Agencies  to  improve homeland security at  bridges and tunnels throughout New York City.  $500,000 to improve the roads and facilities  at  the Kew Gardens Long  Island Rail Road  Terminal.  $950,000 to design and construct a bicycle  and pedestrian walkway along the decommissioned Putnam Rail Line in the Bronx.  $2,000,000 to improve 125th Street in Harlem  in conjunction with  improvements being  made by Columbia University.  $1,000,000 to help Easter Seals purchase  and equip cars that provide livery service to  disabled New Yorkers.  And $1,000,000  to establish a bus  rapid  transit system at a location to be detemined in  consultation with  the Transportation Workers  Union. Bus rapid transit uses a variety of traffic improvements, like exclusive bus lanes and  coordinated signal changing,  to speed bus  travel on congested city routes.  At  the  urging  of  Congresswoman  VELA´ZQUEZ, Congressman CROWLEYand myself, the bill includes more than $1,500,000 for  pedestrian safety  improvements on Queens  Boulevard.  These high priority projects will make a considerable contribution to the lives of New York  City residents. I could not have secured these  and other programs within TEA–LU without  the help and counsel of  individuals here  in  Washington, as well as  in Albany and New  York City.  In particular, I would like to thank both the  Democratic and Republican staff of the Transportation Committee, both of whom worked  tirelessly on this piece of legislation, and who  deserve  the entire House’s  thanks.  In particular, I would like to thank Ken House, Clyde  Woodle,  Eric  Vanschyndle,  Ward  McCarragher,  Kathleen  Zern,  David  Heymsfeld,  Dara  Schleiker,  and  Sheila  Lockwood of Mr. OBERSTAR’s staff. Additionally, I would like to thank Jim Tymon of Mr.  YOUNG’s staff who for his willingness to work  with me on the issue of Ferry Transportation.  I would also  like  to  thank Tom Kearney,  Tom Herritt and their colleagues at the Albany  Office of the Federal Highway Administration,  Nancy Ross, Fred Neveu, Ron Epstein and  their colleagues at the New York State Department of Transportation, and Andra Horsch and  David Woloch and their colleagues at the New  York City Department of Transportation.  f  RECOGNIZING JOHN SPAAR  HON.

667,127,2004-04-20,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  take  this means to recognize John Spaar, who will  be assuming the office of President of the Missouri Press Association in 2005. He will be the  third generation in his family to hold this office.  His mother, Betty Spaar, and his grandfather,  W.L. Simpson, preceded him.  The Missouri Press Association, first organized in 1867, is a voluntary membership of  newspapers in the state. All daily newspapers  and almost all weekly newspapers are members. Activities of the association include setting up workshops,  seminars,  conventions,  publication of a magazine (The Missouri Press  News),  supplying  information  for members,  and helping newspapers find skilled personnel.  The  association’s  greatest  accomplishment  has been  the establishment of  the Missouri  School of Journalism at the University of Missouri-Columbia, the first school of journalism  in the world. Today, the association continues  to assist  the school  in placing graduates  in  outstanding jobs.  The Missouri Press Association  is  in  the  middle  of  a  long-range  planning  process.

668,134,2004-04-20,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the work of an outstanding  individual, the Honorable Ed Pease, former Congressman to the people of the 7th District of  Indiana, on the conclusion of his second term  as the volunteer International President of the  North  American  Interfraternity  Conference  (NIC). I am proud to have known and worked  with Ed Pease  in a number of  roles as a  former colleague, a  fellow Eagle Scout and  Boy Scout leader, a friend for life and a fraternity brother.  Ed Pease graduated Phi Beta Kappa from  Indiana University and the Indiana University  Law School. After a period of private practice,  he was elected to the Indiana State Senate  and served for 12 years, where he chaired the  Judiciary Committee and was responsible for  major reform of the state’s criminal justice system. Outside the legislature, Ed worked for Indiana State University in Terre Haute as General Counsel and later became the University’s  Vice President for Advancement.  From 1997 to 2001, I had the pleasure of  working  alongside Ed Pease  in  the U.S.  House of Representatives, where Ed was considered one of the GOP’s rising stars. During  his time in Congress, Ed was a valuable member of both the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Judiciary Committee.  At the conclusion of the 106th Congress, Ed  retired  from  the House so he could spend  more time with his family and friends. His retirement was a  loss  for  this House,  for  the  people of the seventh district of Indiana, and  for our country. During his time in Congress,  Ed Pease was widely hailed by his peers as  a smart, hard working, unassuming Member  who cared more about getting  the  job done  than getting credit for his achievements.  Mr. Speaker, Ed Pease might have retired  from the House in 2001, but he has not retired  from a career of selfless public service. It is  this second career of volunteer service that I  have come to praise today. Throughout his career,  regardless of  the significant  time demands of his professional life, Ed has always  made  it a priority  to serve as a community  leader  in organizations  that build  the values  and morals of America’s  young men and  women. Ed has a long history of service to the  Boy Scouts of America both at  the national  council level and here in Washington for the  National Capitol Area Council. Ed has also  been Chairman of  the Boy Scouts’ National  Order of the Arrow Committee. He has been  President of  the Philmont Staff Association  which supports the Philmont Scout Camp in  New Mexico, the Boy Scouts of America’s premier high-adventure  camp  that has  taught  thousands of young men valuable lessons that  last a lifetime.  Ed Pease’s commitment to the moral development of young men has extended past  scouting  to working with college  fraternities,  the organizations that build the character and  leadership skills of tens of thousands of college men every year. Mr. Speaker, it is Ed’s  exceptional work for fraternity men nationwide  that I rise to recognize today. Ed and I share  the bond as brothers of the Pi Kappa Alpha  Fraternity. He was initiated into the Delta Xi  chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Indiana University on February 26, 1971. Ed’s  membership  in Pi Kappa Alpha shapes  the  values that would direct his career of public  service. In 1973, he was named the national  fraternity’s outstanding undergraduate member  before serving on the staff on the national organization. He has a long history as a chapter  advisor  to Pi Kappa Alpha’s  Indiana State  chapter, and in 1983, Ed Pease was named Pi  Kappa Alpha’s national chapter advisor of the  year. From there, Ed has served in a number  of leadership roles at the national level, including four years as National Vice President and  two years as National President of Pi Kappa  Alpha. Ed  is currently serving as  the Secretary/Treasurer of the Pi Kappa Alpha Educational Foundation.  Ed Pease has not been content  to serve  just his own brothers for he has had a larger  mission of improving the collegiate experience  of all men and women who join a college fraternity. For that reason, Ed Pease was elected  to the North American Interfraternity Board of  Directors  in 1995. The NIC  is  the umbrella  group  for 66 national  fraternities  that have  350,000 undergraduate members and 4.2 million  living alumni worldwide.  In 1999, Ed  Pease was elected President of the NIC and  served  the organization  in  that capacity  for  one year.  Now Mr. Speaker, it is hard to explain Ed  Pease’s contribution  to  the  fraternity world  without explaining what  fraternity  life  is all  about. There are those in today’s society who  like to belittle the virtue of the college fraternity  experience but  they don’t  really understand  how important a role these organizations play  in positively influencing the development of tomorrow’s leaders. The critics hold up the actions of a few people as an indictment of a  system  that has done much  for our nation.  Nine million Americans are proud  fraternity  and sorority alumni and their experiences in  these organizations helped them become better students and better citizens of our great  nation. While only three percent of the nation’s  population has been a member of a fraternity  or sorority,  these organizations are proven  leadership laboratories for developing the next  generation of American leaders. For proof, you  need look no further than this Congress itself,  where 110 current Members of the House of  Representatives are alumni of fraternities and  sororities, as are 45 current Senators.  College fraternities and sororities are one of  the most successful  leadership development  programs available to college students today,  helping members graduate with the management and interpersonal skills needed to excel  in  today’s society. These  fraternities are  the  nation’s  largest networks of student volunteers, providing 10 million hours of service a  year and preparing members for a lifetime of  community involvement. Fraternity housing is  the  largest not-for-profit housing market outside of  the host  colleges and universities  themselves. The 250,000 students living in fraternity housing today at 8,000 chapter houses  nationwide have an unparalleled opportunity to  live and work together on a daily basis with  students from different cultures, religions and  life experiences. Fraternities are now the largest, most visible, and most active values-  based  organizations  on  college  campuses  today. The men and women who are fraternity  members today learn how to incorporate the  principles and values of their organization into  their daily lives to form the moral foundation  for their future actions. In 2002, the NIC was  undergoing some dramatic and  fundamental  restructuring of its Board of Directors, with an  eye on improving its ability to serve its student  and alumni members. In need of a leader with  a steady hand and an outstanding vision for  the future, the NIC turned to Ed Pease who  was re-elected President.  In the past two years, the NIC has undergone some major changes that better position  it to advocate for and enforce higher standards for the men who join its fraternal organizations. As part of that change, Ed Pease has  focused the NIC’s efforts on asking Congress  to help college fraternities provide a better experience  for  their members. Ed’s  focus has  been on issues such as freedom of association, membership standards, infrastructure improvements, tax law, leadership development,  and scholastic excellence. He has helped restart the Congressional Fraternal Caucus, an  organization I am proud to chair, along with  Congresswoman  Stephanie  Tubbs  Jones.  Through Ed Pease’s efforts and outreach to  his former colleagues, the Collegiate Housing  and  Infrastructure Act has been  introduced  and sponsored by 65 members of the House  and 15 members of  the Senate. Last September,  this House  included  the Collegiate  Housing and Infrastructure Act as part of the  Charitable Giving Act of 2003 that passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support. If that bill becomes law, it will allow all student associations  on college campuses to use a private market  approach to upgrade and replace their facilities in the future, thus making it possible for  these student groups to continue to thrive for  decades to come. These initiatives are so typical of Ed and his accomplishments  in  the  public arena over the past 30 years: He creates lasting legacies that leave institutions better than he found them.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with you  some representative remarks from Ed’s peers  in  the  fraternity world,  for  they show how  deeply he is respected for his work on behalf  of college students everywhere.

The Colorado Bluesky Enterprises, Inc. has been improving the lives of  Colorado citizens with developmental disabilities and  their  families  for 40 years, and  I  would like to join my colleagues here today in  recognizing  their  tremendous service  to  the  Southern Colorado community.  The Colorado Bluesky Enterprises, Inc. has  provided services and support  to  individuals  with developmental disabilities and their families since its inception in 1964. This wonderful  organization has placed  individuals  in  jobs  throughout the area after training them in their  own community-based cafes and through contracted employment opportunities. The organization has served over 2,000 children with developmental disabilities, ages 0–3 years, by  providing up to three years of therapy, which  enable each child to begin life at their highest  level of physical and cognitive skill.  Colorado  Bluesky  Enterprises,  Inc.  has  served adults by providing residential shelter  with loving host home families for hundreds of  individuals and building affordable housing for  highly independent consumers. In addition, it  has provided  transportation, counseling,  life  skills training and case management to consumers while spending  thousands of hours  training police,  lawyers, city officials,  judges  and members of the Pueblo community about  the special needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. Colorado Bluesky Enterprises  is  the  lifeblood  for  the community of  families who love and care for an individual  with a developmental disability.  Mr. Speaker,  the Colorado Bluesky Enterprises, Inc. is a dedicated, selfless organization  that has 40 years of service assisting  those  in need  from  the Southern Colorado  community. Their focus on individuals with developmental disabilities, and their families, is  outstanding and exemplary to all of us in our  nation. This organization’s enthusiasm and  commitment certainly deserve the recognition  of this body of Congress. Congratulations on  celebrating 40 years of compassionate and  caring service.  f  COMMENDING TAIWAN  HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR.

I also want to commend  Taiwan for its continuing efforts in developing  and sustaining a free democratic society and  free markets.  The people of Taiwan are to be further commended for their efforts seeking greater international  recognition,  including an  increasing  role and participation in the World Health Organization and the United Nations. Quite simply, Taiwan is too important an economic force  and democratic ally to be shunned to the political backwaters of global isolation.  I am encouraged with Taiwan’s new administration’s stated goal of pursuing better relations with the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan’s cross-strait dialogue with  the PRC  is  crucial  for  resolving misunderstandings between Beijing and Taipei and Washington,  which, Mr. Speaker,  is  the  foundation  for  peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and,  indeed, for all of Asia.

671,141,2004-04-20,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing  the career and retirement of Edward Geppert,  the Chief of Staff of the Illinois Federation of  Teachers since 1994.  Prior to that, Ed served the IFT as Director  of Organization (1983–1994), Field Service Director  (1997–1983)  and  Executive  Board  Member (1975–1977).  Ed began his career in education as a social science teacher at Cahokia High School  (1969–77)  teaching  government,  sociology  and history. He has been an  IFT member  since 1969 and is the forma president of the  Cahokia Federation of Teachers, Local 1272.  In 1977, he became a field service director for  the IFT, organizing locals in Southern Illinois.  He has also served as a delegate on the East  St. Louis (now Southwestern Illinois) Central  Labor Council and the Southwest Area Council,  IFT/AFT/AFL–CIO. Ed has also been a  member of  the Glassblowers and Bottlers  Union and the United Rubber Workers.  His expertise  in education and  labor has  been recognized by such groups as the Illinois  Educational Labor Relations Board, the Illinois  State Board of Education, the Illinois Learning  Partnership and Southern Illinois University at  Edwardsville. He is also an active member of  the Labor Committee of the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois.  Ed and his wife Marti, a teacher in Cahokia,  have three sons, Brad, Steve and Dan and reside in Belleville, Illinois. Their special joy is  daughter-in-law Laurie and grandson Jack. Ed  also serves his community through his involvement with the Illinois Learning Partnership.  I have known Ed for many years through his  involvement with my wife Georgia, who is also  an educator.

672,6,2004-04-27,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, the Republicans promised us they would create jobs, but their failed policies have  left our economy weaker. We have lost  2.8 million manufacturing  jobs,  the  largest decline  in over 80 years. We  have not seen one month of manufacturing job growth since George Bush  took office, and Republicans have no  plan to create jobs.  For years the Republicans have used  their power to provide tax breaks and  special deals  for corporate  interests,  standing back while thousands of goodpaying  manufacturing  jobs  were  shipped overseas. And now the American workers  that have built  these  companies are paying the price.  Democrats want to build a stronger  economy and jump-start our manufacturing sector by cutting taxes for domestic manufacturers  and  helping  them create good-paying jobs here in  the United States, and we want to end  unfair tax breaks that would allow corporations  to keep  their money and  their workers overseas. That  is  just  wrong.  We want to stand up for American  workers by enforcing the trade agreements that President Bush has not.  Mr. Speaker, why are Republicans  stalling? What are they waiting for?  They should simply bring up the CraneRangel bipartisan solution to cut taxes  for domestic manufacturers and help  them create good-paying jobs here in  the United States. That is the answer,  and it is simple. f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2004

678,6,2004-04-27,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the  Committee on Government Reform, I  rise in support of H.R. 3942. This legislation  redesignates  the U.S. Postal  Service facility at 7 Commercial Boulevard in Middletown, Rhode Island, as  the Rhode Island Veterans Post Office  Building.  Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s Armed  Forces  are  comprised  of  dedicated,  skilled,  and  courageous  individuals  from all 50 States and every territory.  Today, I am pleased to take time along  with my colleagues to honor those who  have served our Nation from the State  of Rhode Island.  According to the 2000 census data,  over 102,000 veterans live in Rhode Island, comprising 13 percent of the adult  population of the State. This post office designation in Middletown is intended as a tribute to those 102,000  Rhode Islanders.  As we all know, U.S. military men  and women remain engaged today in  the war on terror in faraway places  like Afghanistan and  Iraq. Here at  home we can never give too much back  to our brave active duty personnel or  our veterans to whom we owe our Nation’s  freedom. That  is why  I  am  pleased that the House is considering  H.R. 3942 today. I ask all Members to  support its swift passage.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. KENNEDY) for his work to honor our Nation’s military service veterans from  the great State of Rhode Island.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
679,6,2004-04-27,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield such time as he might consume  to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. KENNEDY), who is also the sponsor  of this legislation.  Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island. Mr.  Speaker, I thank my good friend and  colleague from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS) for  allowing me this time. I also want to  thank my colleague,  the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. CANNON), for also acknowledging me and recognizing this  piece of legislation, and also my friend,  the gentleman  from Minnesota  (Mr.  KENNEDY) from the other side of the  aisle for being here as well. b1415  As the gentleman  from Utah  (Mr.  CANNON) mentioned,  there  are  over  100,000 veterans living in my State of  Rhode Island; and we are proud to support a few veterans from World War I  and almost 40,000 from World War II.  Rhode Island has close to 30,000 from  Vietnam and roughly 20,000 from the  Korean War. And more recently, Rhode  Island is home to 4,000 veterans from  the Persian Gulf War. Just a few weeks  ago, 300 soldiers from Rhode Island’s  Military Police returned from Iraq.  These men and women come from different backgrounds and they live in different cities and towns and many of  them are still working and also many  of them are retired. But the one thing  that they have in common is they have  fought for this country to preserve the  freedom of our Nation. They have all  put their lives on the line in the name  of democracy, and  if they were not  standing post in the front lines, they  signed up and they could well have  been put on the front lines. So all veterans, whether  serving  stateside  or  overseas, deserve our recognition.  Our Nation’s veterans have answered  the call to duty and have served our  country in times of greatest need.  During my time in Congress I have  had the honor to meet with several of  Rhode Island’s veterans, and I discovered that every time I sit down with  one of them, I hear another fascinating  story. Like Ray’s story, a World War II  veteran  living  in Lincoln, Rhode Island. He was the only man from an 11member crew to survive. He remembers  falling from the plane and landing in  his parachute in a group of trees on a  snowy mountainside, but he does not  remember anything after that.

680,13,2004-04-27,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  speak in favor of this resolution that will designate  the month of April as  ‘Financial Literacy Month.’  I would like to thank my colleague, Ms. BIGGERT from  Illinois,  for  introducing this legislation. It is important that we  raise public awareness and support financial  knowledge in the United States. The penalties  that may be associated with a lack of understanding of personal finances are too grave for  Americans to be left in the dark.  The majority of Americans successfully use  the assistance offered by the financial service  industry each year. These organizations help  individuals to build homes, buy a car, finance  an education, start a business, and many  other everyday needs. It is essential that individuals are prepared to manage their money,  credit, and debt as well as to become responsible workers, investors, business leaders, and  citizens.  Promoting  financial  literacy encourages all  Americans  to make wise  financial decisions  and expands their access to the mainstream  financial system  that provides  lower costs,  safer options and a greater ability  to build  wealth. The end result is not only greater empowerment  for  the American people, but a  likely  increase  in  economic  activity  and  growth.  I would like to thank the Financial Literacy  and  Education  Commission,  the  National  Council  on  Economic  Education,  the  Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, its state affiliates, and its partner organizations  for designating April as  ‘Financial  Literacy Month,’  educating  the public about  the need  for  increased  financial  literacy  for  youth in the United States.  Personal finance education and awareness  is fundamental in ensuring that the public is  well-versed  in  issues  that will affect  them  today, as well as in years to come, as they  plan for college, home-buying, and eventually  retirement. We must supply  them with  the  knowledge they need in order to succeed in  today’s complex world of finance.  I urge the passage of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time. ",2004
681,13,2004-04-27,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H. Res. 578, which recognizes and supports the goals of Financial Literacy Month.  Now more than ever, we live in a world that  has become increasingly complicated when it  comes to personal financial matters. A generation ago, a basic knowledge of balancing a  checkbook and maintaining a savings account  was adequate. However,  in  today’s complex  world many Americans are faced with difficult  decisions such as determining what  type of  loan they need; whether to invest in stocks or  bonds; how to best manage credit; and how  soon  to start planning  for  family education  needs and their retirement. There are approximately 40,000 different credit products available, an intimidating thought for the most educated consumer.  Unfortunately, large numbers of consumers  never learn the basics of maintaining their personal finances and may struggle unnecessarily  with choices leading to financial freedom. Instead, many  live paycheck  to paycheck and  acquire substantial debt.  Today, our nation’s youth are bombarded  with a multitude of financial options at an increasingly  young  age. Yet many  are  illequipped to make informed decisions about financial matters. According to a 2001 Teenage  Research Unlimited survey, teenagers spend  rather than save 98 percent of their money, a  total of $172 billion in 2002. One out of every  three  teenagers has credit cards and even  more have an ATM card.  Various  public  and  private  organizations  have developed programs  to promote public  knowledge of basic finances. Many of these  organizations are working with elementary and  secondary students  to provide  them with a  strong education in money management and  provide  teacher  training on how  to  integrate  basic  financial education principles  into curricula.  For example, in my home state of Delaware,  MBNA opened the Financial Advisory Service  (FAS) over ten years ago, which offers professional advice to MBNA people and their immediate family members. FAS, under the leadership of Tom Dibble, set out  to offer professional personal money management education  for all MBNA people. Since the service was  established, MBNA has extended the service  into the community and into the local school  systems through the facilitation of basic credit  and money management  curriculum  to all  grade levels in elementary, high schools, and  colleges throughout the country. FAS has educated  nearly  1,500  students  in Delaware  14,000 students throughout the country since  1995. Their  extensively  educated  advisors  teach, not only credit information, but, especially in the case of students, spend a great  deal of time on financial basics like balancing  a checkbook and budgeting.  This  fall  I held a hearing  in my Subcommittee entitled,  ‘Financial Literacy Education: What Do Students Need  to Know  to  Plan For the Future?’  I was particularly interested  in  learning what schools, government,  and industry were doing to help educate youth  about not only the intricacies of being financially sound, but also the very basics. I was  pleased  to  learn  that  there  is engagement  across the spectrum. I am happy to support  today’s resolution— to recognize those that are  already active, and to encourage more to become active. ",2004
682,13,2004-04-27,Mr. SCOTT of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to recognize April as Financial Literacy Month.  I have  joined with Congresswoman JUDY  BIGGERT to introduce H. Res. 578 to recognize  the goals of Financial Literacy Month. As a  member of Congress who has an MBA from  the Wharton School of Finance, I believe that  there are several steps  that Americans can  take  to gain access  to  the  financial mainstream. The first and most important step is to  have fundamental financial literacy. With that  knowledge, a consumer can increase access  to good credit, home ownership, and be able  to invest money for retirement security.  The JumpStart Coalition, which is a financial  literacy advocacy organization, estimates that  only approximately 15 percent of high school  graduates in the United States have taken a  course  covering  basic  personal  finances.  Through my work as a member of the House  Financial Services Committee, I have come to  recognize  the  importance of  integrating economics and personal  finance  into  the K– 12  curricula, and  the positive  impact  this can  have on millions of  future  investors.  I have  also seen  the need  for continued  financial  education for consumers at all economic levels.  Last year, the House last year passed H.R.  2622, which will allow any American to receive  a free copy of their credit report each year.  This tool will help consumers give their credit  a check-up before they apply for a loan, buy  a house, or make a major credit purchase. We  cannot even begin to encourage low and middle wage earners to use these tools, invest in  the stock market or consider a home mortgage if they do not have a basic economic understanding of savings and credit.  By  having  a  good  understanding  of  finances, Americans can help prevent identity  theft and protect themselves from being victims of predatory  lending practices. Understanding finances also helps consumers know  how to start saving money for retirement and  higher education. Information is needed to inform  tomorrow’s  investors so  that  they can  make sound investment decisions in a variety  of market and economic conditions. The best  way to prevent future economic scandals is to  create smarter investors. This April, Members  of Congress have a good opportunity to put a  spotlight on economic education.  I hope my colleagues will join me by recognizing Financial Literacy Month and supporting  passage of this resolution. ",2004
683,13,2004-04-27,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H.  Res. 578, a resolution that would support the  goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month.  Before I became a Congresswoman, I was  a businesswoman. I started my own consulting  firm in Santa Ana, California assisting public  agencies and private  firms with cost-benefit  analysis, strategic planning and capital acquisition. I have spent many years in the financial  sector, and know first-hand the importance of  financial literacy and education.  As Chairwoman of  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Banking and Finance, I am committed to increasing financial  literacy  in minority communities. Later  this  year, I will be holding an issues conference  with leaders from the financial world to discuss  ways of connecting  the  financial sector with  Hispanic youth to educate them on business  and career opportunities. We will also explore  the obstacles minorities face in obtaining capital and examine the effectiveness of today’s  top  financial companies  in preparing Latinos  as leaders in the banking and financial sector.  Mr. Speaker,  I cannot emphasize enough  the importance of financial literacy. Financial  knowledge  enables  individuals  to  become  more successful, manage their money wisely  and contribute  to  the economy.  It  is critical  that we educate our young people and encourage them to seek out opportunities in the  business world. I thank the Gentlelady from Illinois  for  introducing  this  important bill, and  would urge my colleagues to support it. ",2004

690,20,2004-04-27,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman  from  California  (Ms.  is  recognized  MILLENDER-MCDONALD)  for 5 minutes.  Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr.  Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of this Congress legislation that I  have recently introduced.  The Geothermal Energy Initiative of  2004, H.R. 4094, is legislation that addresses a critically underdeveloped energy segment of our national renewable  energy  portfolio. The  problem was  cited  in a January  2004 Associated  Press article which  stated  that  the  Federal Government has a backlog of  230 lease applications for the prospect  of the utilization of geothermal energy.  This Associated Press article also  stated that the average age of an application for the prospect of geothermal  sites is 9 years.  February  2004  supply  projections  from  the American Gas Association  show that natural gas supplies will remain tight into the foreseeable future  and will  result  in  continued  high  prices. The high cost of natural gas affects  electricity  and  home  heating  costs.  In March of 2004, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s  climate monitoring  laboratory  reported that carbon dioxide levels in our  environment are  rising at alarming  rates. Carbon dioxide contributes to  global warming that disrupts climate  and causes seas to rise.  The  last national  resource assessment of geothermal sites in the United  States was completed  in 1978. There  have been substantial improvements in  technology and advances in geological  sciences in the intervening 26 years.  Clearly, there is a lack of resources  and priority in the Department of the  Interior concerning geothermal energy  efforts.  Now, in the current situation, most  of  our Nation’s  geothermal  power  plants were built in the mid-1980s and  early 1990s when our energy markets  were searching for alternative energy  investments. Unfortunately, since that  time, there has been a significant decline of focus on geothermal energy.  Specifically, the Department of the Interior has steadily de-emphasized the  geothermal energy program in the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S.  Geological Survey.  We must restore that focus. I believe  we have an important opportunity to  reemphasize this vital energy sector  and greatly enhance our Nation’s renewable energy portfolio.  For example, the Bush administration has  repeatedly championed  the  need to expand our renewable energy  sources and to prioritize the development of our country’s geothermal energy sources.  Department of the Interior Secretary  Gail Norton and Department of Energy  Secretary  Spencer  Abraham  have  jointly stated their commitment to increasing our energy security by expanding the use of indigenous resources  on Federal  lands, while accelerating  protection of the environment.  That is not a true assessment as I see  it, however. In fact, a 2003 report from  the Department of Energy found that  California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington State have  the greatest potential for quick development of geothermal resources. Both  those Secretaries, Norton and Abraham, should  look at this report. In  fact, the study listed nine top sites in  California and 10 in Nevada.  Unfortunately, progress has not been  made by either one of these departments. That is why I have introduced  the Geothermal Energy Initiative of  2004, so that Congress, this administration and States can all work in concert.  The Geothermal Energy  Initiative  Act of 2004 is straightforward legislation that will do the following: authorize the update of the 26-year-old national assessment of geothermal  resource. Significant advances in energy  development technology and advances  in geological sciences need to be harnessed to better understand and manage our geothermal resources.  We must provide financial incentives  to encourage the development of geothermal  resources by expanding  the  production tax credit to include geothermal resources.  Direct the Federal land management  agencies to responsibly consider geothermal resources  in their  land use  planning process. The  initiative also  provides direction to assist in streamlining the permit approval process.  Provide provisions to defray costs associated with preparation of documents  and analysis for compliance with Federal environmental protection regulations.  Speaking from a California perspective for a moment, the immediate benefits of this initiative is the enormous  positive impact that it will have on air  VerDate jul 14 2003  01:52 Apr 28, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27AP7.046 H27PT1 ",2004
691,34,2004-04-27,Mr. GRASSLEY., How much time remains  for morning business on our  side?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty-two minutes.  f  NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  ,2004
692,34,2004-04-27,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to address  the  issue of prescription  drugs as part of Medicare, a new provision dealing with Medicare, but before  I do I will comment on the two issues  that have been brought up by Democratic Members of the Senate. I only do  that because I think it is appropriate  people know that there are two sides to  every story—maybe five sides but at  least two in the Senate.  I do not find fault with my Democratic friends for bringing issues to the  Senate floor, but in the case of the  high cost of gasoline as an example,  which the Senator  from Oregon was  talking about, all I can say is we had a  national energy policy before the Senate. It passed the House last year; it  passed the Senate last year. We spent a  couple of months  in conference and  worked out a very good compromise. It  passed the House of Representatives by  a wide margin. Exactly how much I do  not recall. Then it came to the Senate  and we were faced with a filibuster.  In that filibuster cloture vote, we got  58 votes. It obviously takes 60 votes to  stop a filibuster. Out of those 58 votes,  we only had 13 out of 49 Democrats  vote to break that filibuster. So there  are another 36 Democrats that if they  want to help us reduce the cost of energy, I would beg them to tell our leader that they are prepared to break that  filibuster. The leader filed a motion to  reconsider. We could bring  that up  again and within 2 minutes we would  have a national energy policy  that  would send a clear signal to OPEC that  we have our energy house in order in  this country, and hopefully let them  know they are not going to have an  economic stranglehold on our economy  as they evidently think they have by  reducing their production of oil by 4  percent as they did a month ago.  Why would we not expect the OPEC  nations to take advantage of a divided  Congress when we all know, with the  energy blackout in the Northeast last  August and with $2 gasoline right now  in the United States, that this country  ought to be doing everything it can to  solve its energy problem?  The national energy policy we had  before Congress last fall that there was  a Democrat filibuster against would be  a solution because it emphasizes in a  very balanced way three things: One,  tax incentives for the enhanced production of fossil fuels; No. 2, tax incentives  for renewable fuels, wind energy, ethanol, biodiesel, biomass; and tax incentives for conservation, such as fuel cell  cars.  So when we have an effort to bring a  national energy policy before this Congress, and it is defeated by a filibuster  that only 13 out of 49 Democrats would  support,  then  it  seems  to me very  wrong for people on the other side of  the aisle to be complaining about the  high price of gasoline.  Now, it is all right to complain about  the high price of gasoline because I do  every time I go to fill up my car, but  on the other hand, it is one thing to  complain about it and not do anything  about it. What we need to do is join  forces to get this national energy bill  passed. It would help if we could get  two more Democrats to help us defeat  that filibuster.  f  EDUCATION FUNDING  ",2004
693,34,2004-04-27,Mr. GRASSLEY.," As to the issue of  education, all I can point out is that  this President has always had education very high on his agenda. Except  for September 11 and the war that we  are now involved in, education would  be No. 1 on this President’s agenda. But  because of the war, we are in a budget  situation now where we are having 10-  percent increases for homeland security, 7-percent increases for defense because of the war, and we are having 3-  percent increases for education. Now,  that may  be,  as  the  distinguished  Democratic  leader said, the smallest  increase  in education  for years, but  this 3-percent increase in education is  far higher than anything else in the domestic budget that the President proposed to the Congress of the United  States because every other domestic  program in that budget is going to be  increased nine-tenths of 1 percent.  So when we are  involved  in war,  whether it is the 21st century war on  terrorism or whether it is the 20th century war on fascism, World War II, this  country puts all of its efforts behind  the men and women who are on the  front line, giving them all of the resources they need to win that war because we only go to war if we go to war  to win. This President has done that.  But, after taking care of our responsibilities to the men and women on the  battlefield, this President has always  had education at the top of his agenda.  With the way this year’s budget treats  education compared to every other domestic program, and only  third  to  homeland security and the war, this  President is keeping his commitment  to education.  f  MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG  PROGRAM  ",2004

701,48,2004-04-27,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, I would  like to address this issue as it lays  right now as we are moving to proceed,  and  some  of  the misinformation,  mischaracterizations of where we are.  This issue is not a novel or new one for  the Senate. We have debated this in the  committee. It has been on the floor.  Senator WYDENand I were ready to roll  with this back in November—a permanent moratorium making sure forever  there would  not  be  discriminatory  taxes, multiple taxes, or access taxes  for consumers on the Internet. Now we  get to this point and there are a lot of  mischaracterizations.  The Senator from Arizona, chairman  of the Commerce Committee, has come  up with a proposal, an amendment to  the bill, which is not permanent. To me  it is not ideal. It is not perfect. But a  lot of what happens in the Senate fails  to meet that standard of ideal and perfect. Once in a while, one has to be  practical, pragmatic, and  sometimes  cut back on what you think  is the  ideal.  This amendment of the Senator from  Arizona is a 4-year moratorium rather  than a permanent moratorium. I look  at a ‘‘Dear Colleague’’ letter from some  of my colleagues, Senator CARPERand  Senator ALEXANDER, and they say: A  moratorium of 4 years, that is tantamount  to a permanent moratorium  while they argue for a 2-year extension  of a moratorium.  Well, if 4 years is permanent, I guess  whoever gets elected President next  year is going to be there permanently;  Senators with a 6-year term, that must  be ad  infinitum. Four years  is temporary; it is not ideal. I would prefer it  to be permanent, and  the  reason  I  would like it to be permanent is because companies have to invest millions, tens of millions of dollars, if they  are going to get broadband out, espeY T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:27 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S27AP4.REC S27AP4 cially small towns and rural areas. In  the event there is a shorter duration,  then that means it is less likely that  there will be stability, predictability,  and confidence that the laws will stay  the same. Anyone, even those with a  fourth grade education—at least those  students who have the benefit of Virginia’s standards of learning—will understand that  if you tax something,  fewer people will be able to afford it.  The question before the Senate  is  whether we want to have Internet access and the Internet service monthly  bills to be burdened with, on average,  about a 17-percent tax, as is the case on  telephone bills. Senator WYDEN, myself, and many others believe that if we  want more people to have access to  broadband and the Internet, then the  best way is not to burden it with regulations or taxes. This is particularly  true for those with lower incomes and  those in rural areas and small towns,  who need access to the ability to conduct commerce, access to education,  access to telemedicine—access to all  forms of information, which is key to  competitiveness these days.  The grandfather clause has also been  changed from the bill Senator WYDEN  and I originally introduced. We wanted  to stop those who found a loophole in  the original moratorium and started  taxing the backbone of the Internet.  They are taxing that and, of course, ultimately the consumer has to pay for  those taxes. We wanted to stop that  immediately. Senator MCCAIN’s amendment gives those States greater leeway  and gives them up to 2 years to wean  themselves off of this latest loophole  for taxation. For those who have been  taxing prior to 1998—and many States  are still taxing—although States such  as Iowa, South Carolina, Connecticut,  and the District of Columbia, which  were grandfathered, have stopped taxing Internet access. But other States  are  continuing  to  do  so.  Senator  MCCAIN’s amendment—unlike what the  House did, which was stopping these  States  from  taxing  instantly—gives  them 3 years to wean themselves off of  it.  The  compromise  that  Senator  put  forward,  to me,  is not  ideal; it is beneficial, though, in that  at least for the next 4 years we are protecting consumers from being hit with  these burdensome, counterproductive,  undesirable taxes on their access to the  Internet. While not perfect,  it  is a  measure  that we can move  forward  with. It will have the Senate on record  as not being in favor of taxing access  to the Internet, but rather on the side  of the consumers, on the side of freedom, and on the side of opportunity.

706,48,2004-04-27,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I think  we are probably ready to go to the bill.  Let me make a point, however, with respect to my colleague from Virginia.  Look, once again, there  is no disagreement in this Chamber about the  question of whether we would support  punitive or discriminatory taxes with  respect to the Internet. The answer is,  of course not. I don’t care how long the  moratorium is for. Let it be forever, as  far as I am concerned. That is not the  issue. The issue with the legislation  proposed is what kind of definition exists, and what will the impact of that  definition be on the revenue base of the  State and local governments?  If we can get that definition squared  away in a thoughtful and appropriate  way, we ought to pass this 100–0. I regret that that is not the case with respect to the compromise offered. That  should not surprise anybody because  this has gone on now for some months.  It is complicated, and we have found it  difficult to reach agreement or an acceptable compromise at this point. I  expect the likely thing to have happen  here is we will be on the bill itself and  it will be open to amendment. We can  have amendments, and perhaps second  degrees, and we will have discussion  and votes and find out how the Senate  feels about the specific definitions.  Again, the question of whether there  should be support for a discriminatory  or punitive tax on the Internet—that  ought not to be a question. I think the  answer to that is, no, absolutely not.  Whether it is 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years,  that is not a very big issue for me. We  need, in the coming hours, to focus on  the question of, What is the right definition? What do we intend to accomplish, and how do we define it in a way  that is fair to everybody?  I believe we ought to have public policy that encourages the buildout of  broadband in this country. I think it  will help this country’s economy and  be something that stimulates economic  growth in our country. Whatever we do  with this legislation, I don’t want to  retard the growth of broadband and the  development of the Internet. I think  that I speak for almost all of my colleagues when I say that. Let’s find a  way to write this definition in an appropriate manner and that is satisfactory and move ahead. At this point, it  hasn’t been done even with the compromise. We have much work to do to  reach that point.  Mr. President, I ask, does the Senator from Tennessee seek time?  ",2004
707,48,2004-04-27,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Yes, I seek 30 to 45  seconds.  ",2004

710,62,2004-04-27,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from New Mexico.  ,2004
711,62,2004-04-27,Mr. DOMENICI.," First, I wish to talk  about what is going on in the Senate. I  could hardly believe my friend—and he  is my friend; what he said about our  working together is true, but I could  hardly believe my ears when he suggested that the Republicans are keeping us from voting in the Senate. I  mean, I have a list of what has been  going on for the last 3 months. You  know, it is nothing. It is not because of  the Republicans, but the Democrats on  every issue have said they want to filibuster it. We have had more clotures in  the last 3 months than any 3 months in  the history of  the Republic, unless  there was one after another on one bill  of which I am unaware. So let’s talk  about that in reality.  Let me say to my good friend Senator REID, if he thinks there is only  one good provision in this bill that everybody might vote for, let me tick off  what is in this bill and ask you if you  think it would be 51 or 61 votes for it.  Let me start: Encouraging the production of domestic oil without violating  the environment; encouraging the development of more natural gas from  three sources, all American; encourage  the building of necessary  infrastructure such as the Alaska natural gas  pipeline; encourage more renewable energy—everybody speaks about it, this  bill promotes it, and we can’t pass it—  promote  energy  efficiency;  promote  clean coal technology; increase R&D on  a variety of technologies and improve  our electricity grid.  These are the things in this bill. I  don’t care how big it is, how many  pages are in it. If the distinguished minority leader can bring up one piece of  it because it is popular, then I believe  I ought to be entitled to bring up the  rest of the bill which is also popular.  Remember, there is no MTBE in it. If  we would have brought that first bill  here without MTBE in it, it would have  already passed; we would be finished.  Yet this bill  is more stripped down  than  that. Because  in  addition  to  MTBE not being in it, I have already  told you that it doesn’t cost anything.  I have told you the tax provisions are  somewhere else, and I have just given  you a litany of what is in it.  I submit, before we are finished, if it  takes all night or however long you  want us to be here reading it, that we  will have a vote and it will be a cloture  on this bill and I submit there will be  two of them. There will be one on Senator DASCHLE’s and one on Senator  I  believe  Senator  DASCHLE’s will fail and I believe mine  will pass, and what we will have is we  DOMENICI’s.  will have the hope and have alive the  idea that a good Energy bill, which we  have gone through and swept with all  kinds of brushes to make it a bill that  everybody likes, will be pending before  us.  I am hopeful that in the process we  will not have taken so much time that  Senator MCCAINcan’t get his bill done.  I am very hopeful of that. I hope Senator MCCAIN’s staff understands that  all I have been speaking of, unless we  have to stay here all night and tomorrow to get this read, I am looking for  the time, looking ahead here and figuring that you can get your amendment done and we can get an important decision by this  institution,  in  light of the terrific price of gasoline,  whether they want an energy bill or  not. That is going to be a good one to  watch and it will be a good one to have  a vote on, I will tell you.  How much time do I have remaining?  ",2004

720,62,2004-04-27,Mr. DOMENICI., Certainly.  ,2004
721,62,2004-04-27,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, I ask the  Senator  from New Mexico, while all  this discussion is going on about the  underlying bill, and while it is interesting to talk about endangered species  and Supreme Court cases and so forth,  and energy is important, clean coal and  new sources of natural gas are important, and oil, and a variety of other  things, the fuel cell and so forth—at  any rate, the reality is when you speak  of endangered species, there are endangered jobs in rural America.  Even though this debate is on the  ethanol matter, the Corn Growers Association  is very much  strongly  in  favor of making sure there is no taxation on the Internet. They realize how  important that is; that this measure be  passed for jobs and economic growth in  rural America. There are 35 States in  the Corn Growers Association.  I would ask the Senator from New  Mexico, what is the purpose of reading  this title of this bill as opposed to acting on the Energy bill, which I consider  a detour and a tangent off of the Internet access tax issue, or even addressing  issues from those who want to tax the  Internet and may want to put on some  more amendments?

726,69,2004-04-27,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I am disappointed to have to come to the Senate floor and file these cloture motions  at this time. Earlier today, I had hoped  we would finally make progress on the  pending Internet tax access bill. Last  week, I said we would be addressing the  Internet tax access bill Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, which I  and most people felt would be sufficient  time  to address  this bill and  allow for amendments to be debated  and discussed.  We did debate and vote on a relevant  amendment  offered  by  Senator  HUTCHISONtoday. However, at the very  first opportunity to offer an amendment from the other side of the aisle,  they offered a completely nongermane  amendment, which clearly is going to  slow down this legislation.  On Thursday, these cloture motions  will be voted on. There will be two cloture votes with respect to the energy  amendments, but ultimately we will  have a third cloture vote and that vote  will be on the underlying substitute relating to the Internet access bill. That  is the vote that will determine if we  will be going forward on this bill at  that time.  Again, I scheduled this measure with  the hope of taking a few days and allowing Senators to have that opportunity to bring their amendments to  the Senate floor to debate and vote on  those  amendments.  I  hoped  those  amendments would be centering on the  Internet tax bill, the bill under consideration. The  latest  turn  of  events  today means that many Senators who  have legitimate and relevant amendments are being denied the opportunity  to debate and vote on their amendments. This is unfortunate.  That said, I remain committed to finishing the bill in a timely fashion, and  I hope that we can get back together  tomorrow morning and make appropriate plans  in order to accomplish  that over the course of the next several  days.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.  ",2004
727,69,2004-04-27,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, if the distinguished leader will yield for a brief  comment, as I said to Senator DOMENthis afternoon, this scenario that  has been set up is going to create some  very  interesting votes because  if we  move down the road where we come to  a McCain cloture vote, if cloture is invoked, then Daschle and Domenici fall.  At least that is my understanding. If  that is the case, then that part of the  Energy bill would be gone. But anyway, that sets up some interesting dynamics here.  We do at least have out here, in addition to the FSC legislation, pieces of  the original Energy bill. Who knows,  we might wind up doing something on  energy.  ",2004
728,69,2004-04-27,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I do hope  we will be able to complete the Internet access bill and that we can work  through the turn of events of today.  Again, I hope over the course of the  evening people will come back and lay  out a plan to accomplish what is important to the technology community  and  the communications community  broadly, and that is to be able to allow  people to vote on the very important  underlying bill.

730,69,2004-04-27,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I rise today  to congratulate J.A. Tiberti on his selection by the Boulder Dam Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America for  the 2004 Good Scout Award. His philanthropic ventures and contributions to  our State’s economy have long made  him a valuable part of the southern Nevada community.  The Good Scout Award recognizes an  individual who exemplifies Scouting’s  ideals through professional leadership,  community involvement, and personal  commitment to excellence. This award  reflects the personal character, dedication, and generosity of the recipient,  and I can think of nobody more deserving than Mr. Tiberti.  As founder and chairman of Tiberti  Companies, Mr. Tiberti has served as a  prominent leader in southern Nevada’s  business community  for  the  last  60  years. The company’s construction of  schools, hotels, banks, grocery stores  and department stores has helped meet  the needs of southern Nevada’s growing  population.  He also contributed to the region’s  dramatic growth by serving on the Las  Vegas Planning Commission  for  25  years and as a director of Nevada  Power Company for 36 years.  Mr. Tiberti has also been a noted philanthropist, giving generously to many  worthwhile causes. In 1979, he contributed $1 million to create the College of  Engineering at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. This generous gift expanded  the opportunities  for higher  education available to Nevadans and  helped UNLV become one of our Nation’s leading universities.  Mr. Tiberti and his family also have  longstanding ties with the Boy Scout  program and were instrumental in the  development of Spencer W. Kimball  Scout Reservation, Camp Potosi.  Please join me in congratulating J.A.  Tiberti on this well-earned honor.  f  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  WILLIAMLABADIE  ",2004

750,104,2004-04-27,Ms. MAJETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise on this  Yom Ha’atzmaut,  Israel’s  Independence Day  celebration,  to  congratulate  the  people  of  Israel in their fifty-sixth year. I would like to recount a brief passage from Yitzchak Rabin, a  warrior of peace, upon  the occasion of his  signing a Declaration of Principles for the Oslo  Peace Accords in Washington, in what seems  like a  forever ago,  in 1993. Prime Minister  Rabin said then: We have come  from an anguished and  grieving land. We have come from a people,  a home, a family that has not known a single  year, not a single month, in which mothers  have not wept for their sons. We have come  to try and put an end to the hostilities so  that our children, and our children’s children, will no longer experience the painful  cost of war, violence and terror. We have  come to secure their lives and to ease the  sorrow and the painful memories of the past,  to hope and pray for peace. On  the  fifty-sixth birthday of  the State of  Israel, we are still praying for that peace. Day  after day, hour after hour, we see mothers  weep for their sons and daughters. But we no  longer see those images as distant— because  it has happened here,  too,  in  the United  States. We know now that terrorism incurs irreparable pain and loss. The State of Israel  has known this loss since its modern beginnings in 1948.  Our loss in the United States connects us to  Israel beyond the often symbolic, annual gesture of alliance— we are dear friends, and our  friendship runs deep. It is rooted in the values  and  ideals we share— Israel, a vibrant and  passionate democracy which includes respect  for diversity and  religious  freedom  for all  faiths, mirrors  the proud  character of  the  United States  And so, today, I wish the state of Israel and  its citizens a peaceful birthday— last year I had  the opportunity to visit Israel for the first time.  Upon seeing the sunrise over the old city walls  of Jerusalem, I was overwhelmed by the region’s history. The  leaders and citizens of  Israel have yearned to achieve their vision of  peace since the modern State of Israel was  born. But this vision eludes us still. We cannot  let this peaceful image go— we must continually strive to reach it.  Upon its establishment, the first official recognition of the State of Israel came from the  United States of America. We have continuously demonstrated our support  for  Israel— and that support will be strengthened as we  endure the pain of terrorism, and fight the battle for a lasting and secure peace, together. f  ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 27, 2004 ",2004
751,104,2004-04-27,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker. I rise in honor  of Israel Independence Day, Yom Ha’atzmaut,  to celebrate the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship and pay  tribute  to  the people of  Israel whose vibrant democracy and brave  military stand beside us on the front lines of  the war against terrorism.  In the fifty-six years since the establishment  of the State of Israel, the United States has  worked with Israel to create a wide array of  foundations and forums for bilateral cooperation  on  issues  ranging  from  agriculture,  science, energy, and the environment, to the  development of  technology  for military and  homeland security needs.  We have also worked hard to build a robust  economic relationship. Despite the small size  of  Israel’s population,  Israel’s GNP  is now  higher than that of most of its neighbors combined. This is a testament to the openness of  the  Israeli economy and  its high volume of  trade with the United States.  Perhaps most fundamental, however, is our  work together to advance peace and security  in the region. While Israeli peace agreements  with Egypt and Jordan are enduring cornerstones of this effort, the refusal of the Palestinian leadership to embrace a peaceful and  democratic future remains a painful challenge.  Each year, on the Israeli calendar, the celebration of Yom Ha’atzmaut comes on  the  heels of Yom Ha’zikaron,  Israel’s Memorial  Day, when  the nation expresses  its eternal  debt and gratitude to the soldiers who gave  their lives for the achievement of the country’s  independence and  its  continued existence.  Tragically, over the past three years of Palestinian  terrorism, hundreds of  Israeli civilians  have joined those fallen heroes on front lines  that now encompass the doorstep of its cafes,  buses, and supermarkets.  Although the Palestinians have attempted to  justify their hatred as a reaction to Israel’s settlement policy or its acts of self defense, the  true source of violence is the Palestinian leadership’s desire to annihilate the Jewish State  even if it sacrifices the dream of Palestinian  statehood.  That is why even as the United States remains an honest broker in the effort to reach  a final peace settlement, as a nation fighting  the threat of terrorism ourselves we must continue to act in solidarity with Israel and on behalf of its right to exist as a secure, democratic, and Jewish state  for generations  to  come. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HISTORY  OF THE GREAT SAND DUNES NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 27, 2004 ",2004
752,104,2004-04-27,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  highlight the grassroots effort to protect one of  Colorado’s  greatest  natural  treasures: The  Great Sand Dunes. I was privileged to play a  part in this momentous and exciting process.  My own effort to preserve this beautiful area  began  in 1989 on a  family vacation  to  the  Great Sand Dunes National Monument  in  Colorado’s San Luis Valley, where  I had a  conversation with my friend Bob Zimmerman  about his idea to re-designate the Great Sand  Dunes National Monument as a National Park  and Preserve. This conversation with Bob was  the catalyst for a decade-long effort to put the  Sand Dunes  in  their rightful place alongside  the nation’s other crown jewels as a National  Park and Preserve.  A rare gem, Colorado’s Great Sand Dunes  cover an area of thirty-nine square miles and  reach heights of 700 feet above the floor of  the flat San Luis Valley, making them the tallest dune  fields  in  the western hemisphere.  The Dunes  are  nestled  between  rugged,  snowcapped mountains  that  include 14,000foot peaks peppered with pristine alpine tundra. The Great Sand Dunes of Colorado are a  unique hydrological system that feeds one of  Colorado’s  largest wetland areas and are  home  to  beaver meadows  and  spacious  grasslands  that  are  dotted with  beautiful  mountain flowers. High mountain streams cascade first into pristine lakes situated above the  timberline,  flowing  into dense spruce and  fir  forests, streaming farther to reach large Aspen  groves, ponderosa forest, pinion-juniper woodlands, cottonwood and mountain willow riparian areas. As  the newest member of America’s National Park system,  the Great Sand  Dunes is one of the nation’s most biologically  diverse parks, encompassing wetland species  such as sandhill cranes, the rare white-faced  ibis, and Rocky Mountain species of bighorn  sheep, marmots and ptarmigan.

753,111,2004-04-27,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dedicated service of an individual  from my district who has devoted her professional life to enhancing the educational development of students in our great State of Arkansas.  Patrica Ann Johnson has given 36 years of  service in education to primary and community  college students. On April 30th, Ms. Johnson  will retire  from  teaching, but her  legacy will  continue in the schools and community where  she taught.  Ms. Johnson served Mena  for 31 years,  teaching  the  first, second,  third, and  fourth  grades at Louise Durham Elementary School  where she was a continued source of inspiration  for hundreds of school children while  working  for  their educational and social advancement.  In  addition  to  her  elementary  school teaching, Ms. Johnson taught physical  and health education at Rich Mountain Community College to students enrolled in those  programs.  Ms. Johnson is an outstanding example of  the lifetime dedication to service of Arkansas  educators. I urge all citizens of Mena and the  staff and students of Louise Durham Elementary School and Rich Mountain Community  College to join me in honoring the career of a  truly gifted, caring, and committed woman on  the celebration of her retirement. f  REGARDING THE VALUE OF LONGTERM  RESEARCH  STUDIES  IN  UNDERSTANDING HEALTH RISKS  AND CONSEQUENCES  HON. LANE EVANS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 27, 2004 ",2004
754,111,2004-04-27,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize an important forum that took place  in our Nation’s capital last month. This forum,  called by  the U.S. Medicine  Institute, convened scientific  leaders  from  throughout  the  Federal Government to discuss the value of  longitudinal studies in determining populations’  risks for developing various health care conditions or diseases.  Science has  long recognized  the value of  such studies, but it is critical for us as policymakers to also understand their role in helping  inform our decisions. As the Ranking Member  of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I am  aware of numerous occasions upon which the  Committee employed data from such studies  to determine matters related to compensation  for service-connected conditions and eligibility  for health care benefits. For example, Congress has used longitudinal studies to determine conditions that should be compensated  due  to veterans’ exposure  to dioxin and  to  identify the effects of various exposures on the  health of veterans from the first deployment to  the Gulf. In the near future, VA intends to propose a  followup study  that will examine  the  long-term effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on veterans. This will provide important  information to current and future generations  of veterans.  Determining  the effects of war-time exposures on veterans’ health is often a convoluted  task. During service, troops may be exposed  to a variety of agents all of which may have  health effects  that are poorly understood.  In  combination, these agents may also have different effects. Further complicating matters,  some exposures are known  to cause health  effects  that do not appear until many years  later. There are often too many unknown factors  to determine exactly which  troops were  exposed to which agents at any point in time.  While  there have been some  limited  improvements  in documentation of  troop  locations,  troop exposures and servicemembers’  health before, during and  immediately  following deployment, large information gaps are  likely to exist well into the future. Longitudinal  research can help fortify available information  and ensure that Congress and the Administration give individuals the benefit of the doubt.  I am pleased that the U.S. Medicine Institute  saw fit to give this important topic its time and  attention. I am offering the Institute’s executive  summary from its March 4, 2004 forum entitled  ‘Taking  the Long View: The Value of  Studies Over Time’  for inclusion in the CONin  the hopes  that all  Members will recognize the importance of supporting these studies to better inform our policy decisions. GRESSIONAL RECORD TAKINGTHELONGVIEW: THEVALUEOF  STUDIESOVERTIME  Long-term  studies help answer  specific  questions  about  health  risks  and  consequences over time and often deliver byproducts not originally envisioned but with  ongoing, exponential value. Consequently,  long-term studies are essential for informed  policymaking and provide liberal return on  the substantial investment they entail.  These were the views interwoven throughout a forum held on March 4, 2004, by the  nonprofit U.S. Medicine Institute for Health  Studies. The consensus among panelists and  participants was that long-term studies undoubtedly deliver great benefit to society at  large, as well as to the specific group or  groups targeted in a particular protocol. For  example, the 22-year-old Ranch Hand study  of agent orange exposure in Vietnam offers a  trove of longitudinal data on the aging process in men—with much of this data yet to be  tapped.  Forum deliberations found long-term studies of such value in answering questions relating to public health that they should become a byproduct of how ‘‘we normally do  business’’ in healthcare—especially as digital patient  records make collection and  analysis of data amenable to routine analysis.  These edited proceedings present the remarks of panelists at the forum and the ensuing discussion among participants. Observations presented during the group’s deliberations include:  Long-term studies are essential for the understanding of disease and, consequently, for  disease management.  They  give  policymakers  the data and  findings needed  to  make rational determinations about eligibility for compensation relating to occupational exposures. As long-term studies are done in future,  they should be accompanied by ‘‘clear’’ business case analyses, ‘‘so that there really is a  clear understanding of  the  rewards  that  come from the . . . investment in conducting  these studies.’’  As disease patterns among Americans shift  away from the acute toward chronic, multiple conditions, long-term studies will assume a greater role, because they allow examination of particular populations and pick  up a  ‘‘different set of information’’ about  risk factors than short-term clinical trials  can.  Decades-long  studies  such  as  the Framingham Study that delineated risk factors  in heart disease and the Harvard Nurses  Study of risk factors for major chronic diseases in women are well-known examples of  the  importance  that  long-term  investigations can have in shaping health practices  and policies.  Long-term  studies conducted by  federal  agencies need the stability afforded by designated  funding, rather than having their  funds come through basic agency appropriations.  The Veterans Affairs and Defense departments use long-term studies to help answer  questions about potential deleterious health  effects in troops from exposures during deployments—questions now anticipated  for  every deployment: Who was exposed; are  those exposed showing unusual disease; are  those exposed dying at unusual rates or from  unusual causes, or has their health changed  over time; do those exposed show higher incidence of cancer(s); do the children of those  exposed exhibit higher rates of birth defects?  A classic  longitudinal study  is the Air  Force Ranch Hand Study, initiated in 1982,  which has seen the collection of 74,000 biological specimens and 19,000 x-rays and has  involved more than 13,000 physical exams,  more than 20,000 questionnaires and thousands of records on conception and birth. In  addition, more than 2,800 death records have  been obtained.  This study is scheduled to terminate in  2006, but that directive has met with controversy on grounds there is much information yet to be mined. To resolve whether the  study  should be continued, Congress has  asked the Institute of Medicine to examine  the scientific merit of retaining and maintaining the medical records, specimens and  other data collected for the study; the potential value of extending the study; and the advisability and costs of making study specimens available to independent researchers.  An important longitudinal study that is  just beginning in the military is the Millennium Cohort Study, which involves an initial  study group of 10,000, with 20,000 more to be  added this year and another 20,000 to be  added in 2007. The study will examine employment  exposures  and  post-deployment  consequences in a group exposed in Kosovo  or Southwest Asia,  compared  to a nonexposed cohort.  Study participants will be followed every  three years by postal surveys; demographic  and health information will be obtained and  correlated over a 22-year period.

755,118,2004-04-27,Mr. RODRIGUEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate the state of Israel on the celebration of  its 56th anniversary of  independence. Born out of the ashes of the Holocaust,  Israel has blossomed into a dynamic and successful democracy. I urge all of my colleagues  to pause and recognize  this grand achievement.  Since their forced removal from the historic  land of  Israel by  the Romans some 2,000  years ago, Jews have migrated the four corners of the earth. With the establishment of  the modern state of Israel, Jews once again  found sovereignty and self-rule in the land of  their forefathers  The United States has a special relationship  with Israel and her people, and it is right that  we do. Israel, like the United States, values  liberty, individual expression, and freedom of  religion, assembly and the press. It too is a  land of immigrants from continents as diverse  as Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. We  share basic values of freedom, a love of life,  and a concern  for our citizens’ well-being.  Israel also is a land of great innovation, home  to great advancements  in biosciences, agriculture and computer sciences to name a few.  Israel’s military and our own share resources  and work together to achieve advances in defense technology that benefit both nations.  We all know that Israel finds itself beset by  enemies sworn to its destruction, facing daily  acts of terrorism. We in Congress stand firmly  behind Israel’s security. Israel is a reality, and  it is here to stay. The sooner Israel’s neighbors accept this basic point, the sooner we will  see progress toward peace.  Israel  faces many great challenges, and  solving them will take our active participation.  The United States has a stake in the future of  Israel and in the entire region, and we must  not neglect our obligation to lead and the opportunity to respond. We should not dictate results, but should work always to create an environment that encourages dialogue.  Today  is a day of celebration, one  that  marks  the great achievements of  Israel and  her citizens these past 56 years. Like our own  independence,  Israel’s comes at great cost.  We all look forward to the day when Israel will  celebrate its independence in peace.

756,3,2004-05-06,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  have been listening to my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle. The issue  has never been whether or not our  troops could win a war. They are the  finest fighting men and women in the  world, and they can win a war.  The issue is the mismanagement of  this administration, their inability to  win the peace. The mismanagement of  our war is not the fault of our troops.  It starts with the Secretary of Defense  who is out of the loop. It is a failure of  candor with people  in this Congress  who have to rely on the The New Yorker magazine to find out things that the  Administration should have provided  to our committees. It is a failure of our  committees to move forward to deal  with the investigations of problems of  supply, of inappropriate activities on  the part of contractors, of why there  has been a failure of command that has  produced the horrific pictures that put  not just our troops at risk but put at  risk any American traveling  in the  Middle East.  I think it is time for my colleagues  to get a grip and get back to the business that we should, as Members of  Congress,  fulfill our  responsibilities,  not try to play politics.  f  STAND UP FOR AMERICA  (Mr. BURNS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Nothing could be further from  the truth. We must continue to fight  terrorism wherever  it exists  in  the  world.  Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that the  security of our Nation depends upon  stabilizing Iraq, Afghanistan, the Middle East and bringing peace and freedom to that region of the world. It is  time to stand up for America. It is  time to stand firm for freedom.  Mr. Speaker, we are blessed to live in  the greatest Nation on Earth.

758,3,2004-05-06,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, Secretary Powell came before the Congressional Black Caucus yesterday. Every  Member was there. They asked him,  Are you going to ask for more money?  He said, There  is no need  for more  money.  Within 2 hours, the President of the  United States came on and said, We  need $25 billion more money.  Even the Secretary of State is left  out of the loop. This government has  no plan; and the fact that a Member  has finally stood up and said what everybody knows, the emperor has no  clothes, it is about time somebody said  that.  My newspaper, the lead editorial this  morning is  ‘‘Rumsfeld Must Go.’’ He  laid our people out there in danger.  There is a study out of the Army that  says that a quarter of the people who  have died would not have died if they  had provided the proper equipment.  Now, this was a war of choice. We did  not have to go. Nobody was attacking  us. It is clear we were not in danger.  b1015  They chose a day to go and so they  went, whether they were ready or not.  They did not care about the troops. Our  troops are being badly used by rotten  leadership.

I cherish the time that I have been  able to spend here representing my District.  Mr. Speaker, my son is a member of  the Air National Guard of the 136th  Wing out of the old Carswell Air Force  Base in Dallas. He is a staff sergeant,  but I picked up the paper this morning  like so many of my friends, and we see  that the leaders on the other side have  proclaimed the war unwinnable, and I  think of all of the brave young men  and women that I saw when I was in  Iraq two times in the past year, and I  cannot help but feel a profound sense of  sadness that they feel that their leaders have abandoned them.  Now, we are all outraged and saddened by the photos of mistreatment of  the Iraqi prisoners we have seen on our  television screens. The abusers will be  punished. The  commanding  officers  will likely have their careers in ruins,  but I just want to caution the leaders  on  the other  side,  indeed  the candidates who are running for the highest  office in this land, that this response is  reminiscent of the response that a candidate named KERRY, 30 years ago had  before the Senate committee where he  condemned all of our troops in Vietnam.

I am not going to challenge the ruling of the Chair; but if the candidate of  the Democratic Party  is accused of  condemning our  troops,  I  find  that  crossing  the  line,  inappropriate and  wrong.

772,10,2004-05-06,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my  colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Washington (Mr. HASTINGS) for yielding me this time. I rise today in strong  support of both the rule and the underlying resolution.  I believe most Americans, as I was,  were extremely upset by the images  they  saw  on  television  of  prisoner  abuse in Iraq, and the horrific actions  just  defy  everything  that America  stands  for and Americans stand  for:  goodness, decency,  fairness, compassion.  The perpetrators of these dastardly  deeds must be swiftly brought to justice and severely punished for their actions.  America and our allies liberated Iraq  from a despot. Mr. Speaker, our soldiers are very  sincerely over  there  helping to restore basic services to Iraq  and make life for the Iraqi people much  better, and they are doing it at serious  risk to their own lives. A few sick people in the military have set back our  efforts for peace in the Mideast and  around the world for who knows how  long. They have destroyed all of the  good relationships our soldiers and others have established in Iraq. And the  majority of our service men and women  are very good, decent, patriotic Americans, very honorable.  So we must not allow these actions  by a few to overshadow the goodness of  the majority of Americans or of our  soldiers, or the effort to win the war on  terror. We cannot close the book on  terror until we close this chapter on  Iraq.  ",2004

774,10,2004-05-06,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank my colleague and my  good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for yielding me this time. This morning he and  I and the other members of the Committee on Rules who are here met at 7  o’clock a.m. to discuss this resolution.  Now, the simple fact of the matter is,  it is important for us to recognize that  the American military has no peers. It  is also important for us to recognize  that most of the men and women, the  great majority of the men and women  in the military are not the kind of people that are now being investigated and  that we see so widespread, and are not  the kind of people that would abuse  people in the circumstances that the  detainees found themselves.  It  is unfortunate that this matter  does not come to the floor under unanimous consent. It does have, as I pointed out this morning, one or two flaws  that could easily have been corrected  had the majority determined that it  was proper to do so.  One of those flaws allows itself to  come forward in one paragraph which  reads, ‘‘Whereas the Congress was not  fully informed of the existence,’’ and  that is true, ‘‘or the seriousness.’’ But  it does not say what I think it should  say, and that is that we decried the  fact that for too long, this was in the  hands of military higher-ups who did  not deem the oversight responsibilities  of Congress important enough for them  to bring the matter forward.  Additionally,  this  is  a  resolution  about horrors that took place inside a  prison. This is not a proper place, in  my judgment, for us to be bragging  about anything concerning the conditions being better after the removal of  Saddam Hussein.  Additionally, it is that these abuses,  as offensive as they are, need to be put  in perspective with regard to the ongoing military effort.  I would urge everybody to take a  deep breath and  to  realize  that no  American, Republican  or Democrat,  would allow for this kind of conduct,  and no one from the President on down  does not feel sorry that this occurred,  and all of us should be in a position to  do as the general who now is in charge  of this prison did, and that is, apologize  not only to the detainees that this occurred to, but to the others who likely  feel that America has lost its moral authority.  America will never lose its moral authority, because in this body and in the  White House and in the Secretary of  Defense’s office, and in the Secretary  of the Army’s office, justice will come  to those who took advantage of others  in circumstances that were not proper.

(Mr. GOSS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
776,10,2004-05-06,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague and  friend, the gentleman  from Washington  (Mr. HASTINGS)  for  yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, we have always known  that the war on terrorism was going to  be  lengthy  and  difficult. President  Bush told us that from the very beginning.  Americans everywhere have girded  up for a sustained conflict across the  globe, around the world. We have great  and justifiable pride in our troops and  all they have accomplished. We have  accepted the necessary sacrifices in the  war on terrorism with a heavy, but a  resolute heart in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.  However, it is impossible to accept  the apparently isolated, but nonetheless totally deplorable instances of blatant prisoner mistreatment that have  surfaced in the past week. These actions,  particularly when  contrasted  with the courageous and honorable decisions made day in and day out by the  vast majority of our American soldiers  in  difficult  circumstances, must  be  strongly condemned.  The charges of abuse will be examined  fully and  immediate corrective  measures  taken  to  prevent  against  their reoccurrence. That is assured. No  equivocation can be tolerated. Wrong is  wrong. The  international community  will be watching America’s actions  closely, and now is the time to demonstrate anew that the American soldier respects the rules of engagement  and always values justice and humane  treatment of detainees and prisoners.  We all abhor the slaughter and maiming and carnage of innocent victims,  which, of course, is the terrorists’ hallmark.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our  military has worked too hard and accomplished too much to be stained by  the actions of a few. By acknowledging  that this  is a tremendously hurtful  anomaly in an otherwise impressive effort, I hope that justice may be swiftly  served and the trust in America restored.  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence routinely and  regularly oversees interrogation activity for intelligence purposes, and we  are giving comprehensive attention, of  course, to these newly-discovered abusive treatment cases. In  fact, as we  speak,  our  committee  is  receiving  briefings upstairs  and  asking  some  very tough questions, and I will return  to that meeting forthwith.  The conduct of appropriate and professional  interrogation  is  extremely  important to the successful prosecution of the war on terrorism and the  protection of our troops and citizens at  home and abroad.  b1145  Terrorism is a bad thing, and interrogation on a proper level of a terrorist is  an important tool for us to preempt  the mischief that they can cause us.  This rule brings forward a clear resolution  that  supports  the  views  I  espouse and that other Members have  espoused articulately. I urge passage  for this rule and for this resolution.  ",2004

780,17,2004-05-06,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, let me  just answer the gentleman who has  just spoken. There are three investigations going on right now. There is a  CENTCOM investigation, a criminal investigation going on right now. If there  are other people involved beyond these  six, those people will be picked up in  that investigation. There is also a Department of the Army  investigation  and a Department of the Navy investigation going on.  Further, let me say to my friends,  the ranking member, the gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. SKELTON), and  I  worked on  this  together. The Committee on Armed Services was the appropriate  standing committee  to do  this. We worked on this until late last  night, and the people who vetoed what  we thought we had an agreement on  were the Democrat leadership.  Let me tell Members the two paragraphs they vetoed. They wanted to  kick out the two paragraphs that referred to the good works in terms of  providing  food, providing  education,  providing medical capability  to  the  Iraqi people that were given by our  people in uniform. I thought it was appropriate since we have 300,000 people  who have done right to continue to  mention the fact that they have done  some good things in Iraq. I think the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr. SKELTON) agreed with that also.  The Democrat  leadership  did not  want to include those good things in  this particular resolution, and that is  why  this had  to come  forward not  under unanimous consent agreed to by  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr.  SKELTON) and myself, but  it had to  come forward through the rules process.

783,17,2004-05-06,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, I would say two things. First,  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  HUNTER) and the cosponsor, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SKELTON),  are entitled to their decisions; but so is  the whole House. It is the House that  should decide whether paragraphs go in  or out. I do not understand why the  majority does not allow the House to  vote.  Secondly, I appreciate that some investigation is going on; but I am not a  great believer in people investigating  themselves and nobody else. I believe  an outside investigation is necessary.  ",2004
784,17,2004-05-06,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would simply say, before  we knew about this, the criminal procedures were going forward. It was the  United States Army  soldier, not a  press, not an IG who brought this forward. It was a United States Army soldier who brought this forward. Criminal investigations are going on, undertaken by the Army. The court martial  process is in process.  ",2004

786,17,2004-05-06,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker,  the  gentleman  from California (Mr. HUNTER) apparently thinks  that the Army has been the exemplar  of good self-investigation. Many of us  do not.  But  aside  from  that  substantive  issue, why is this not in a democracy a  subject for full debate of the House, not  a 1-hour constricted debate with no  amendments allowed  constructed by  the majority?

788,17,2004-05-06,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, let me  say to my colleague that when the publicity  flush  is  finished on what was  done by who we have identified as some  six individuals now, they will have received  thousands and  thousands, as  much time and publicity as the 300,000  good Americans who have served this  country, and as much attention from  this Congress.  ",2004
789,17,2004-05-06,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker,  all Americans  have  been horrified by the pictures and accounts of inhumane treatment of detainees in Iraq. The conduct in those  pictures is absolutely intolerable, and  the United States must take swift and  decisive action to investigation and resolve this terrible incident and make  sure it never happens again.  While this resolution calls on the  Secretary of the Army to conduct a  full and thorough  investigation  into  the allegations of mistreatment, take  corrective action against those responsible and ensure that it never happens  again, I believe Congress must also do  its job and conduct its own investigation.  b1230  Mr. Speaker, Congress was never notified  about  the  problems  at Abu  Ghraib prison, even though the Department of Defense had a report outlining  the conditions there 3 months ago. As a  partner in the War on Terror, Congress  absolutely has not only the right, but  the responsibility to investigate what  went wrong up and down the chain of  command.  So today, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’  vote on the previous question. If the  previous question  is defeated, I will  offer an amendment to the rule allowing for the consideration of an amendment offered by the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. SKELTON) affirming the  need  for bipartisan congressional  investigations into these allegations are  of abuse, including those by U.S. civilian contractor personnel or other U.S.  civilians, and into the chain of command and other deficiencies that contributed to such abuse.  Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, voting  ‘‘no’’ on the previous question will not  prevent this House from voting on the  underlying resolution,  it will simply  allow for the consideration of the Skelton amendment and allow the House to  conduct a bipartisan investigation. It  will allow us to do our job, what the  people we represent expect us to do.  Congress is a full partner in the war  on terror. We need to do our job. We  cannot call for accountability by others and then shirk our own responsibility. Let us do our part to resolve  this awful situation and restore confidence and trust in our Nation and in  our military.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous  question.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following  material for the RECORD.  [From the New York Times, May 6, 2004]  RESTORINGOURHONOR  (By Thomas L. Friedman)  We are in danger of losing something much  more important that just the war in Iraq. We  are in danger of losing America as an instrument of moral authority and inspiration in  the world. I have never known a time in my  life when America and  its president were  more hated around the world than today. I  was just in Japan, and even young Japanese  dislike us.

Let me thank my friend, my colleague,  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr.  SKELTON) with whom  I  completely  identify and thoroughly agree with the  remarks he made in setting the stage  for the purpose of this resolution.  As I hold this picture here, it is reference that what our troops are about  in  Iraq. When  I  spoke earlier  supporting the resolution and the rule, I  referred to a call that I had just received from an 82nd Airborne trooper,  who had lost a leg in Iraq for these  children, for these men and women.  I called Daniel Metzdorf back on the  phone at Walter Reed Hospital, where  he is back because of additional infection. I said, Daniel, what do you all  think about what is going on? He said,  it is wrong. Those people will be punished, and, oh, by the way, the people  who put the pictures on the television  to undermine our troops, they ought to  be in jail, too.  God bless our  them.  ",2004

793,24,2004-05-06,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the  gentleman  from Missouri  (Mr.  SKELTON) for the time.  This is a very difficult time for me  because I find it difficult to rise in opposition of this resolution, and the reason I do it is because there just does  not seem to be enough outrage  involved in what is being said.  We should not have to apologize for  brave men and women. We should not  have to apologize for what the executive branch or the Congress has or has  not done. We should not be put in this  position.  Several months ago, I called for the  resignation of the Secretary of Defense  because I thought, as a major architect  of this war, that he was fighting this  war with other people’s children, and  when he said that he did not know  whether or not we were winning or losing the war, when he said that he did  not know whether we were creating  more terrorists than we were killing,  troops and protect  when he said we did not have any plan  to end the war, that it was a slog, I  thought, as a former combat veteran,  is this the leadership that we can expect from the Secretary of Defense? I  thought that America and the military  deserve better than that and he should  resign.  Now the information that we receive  is  that a climate has been created  where a handful of people have committed these atrocities against human  kind in an atmosphere where all of the  people that are in Iraq have been demonized where it appears to American  people and certainly to our military  that the people in Iraq are responsible  for 9/11 and causing us pain, that the  Secretary of Defense did have information months ago about these atrocities;  and that he kept it from the President,  he kept it from the Congress and he  kept it from the American people. I  think that this rises to the point that  it is a high crime and misdemeanor if  he disappointed the President, kept information from the Congress and kept  this  information  from the American  people.  I think America and the world wants  us to show the outrage, not by rhetoric, but by taking action, and if the  President does not fire the Secretary,  if he does not resign, I think it is the  responsibility of this Congress to file  articles of impeachment and force him  to leave office. Then the whole world  would know, not just our military, not  just Americans but the whole world  what we stand for.  If  people  can  say  ‘‘mission  completed’’ when it looks like there is victory and we see atrocities like this and  it happens on someone’s watch, if they  do not have the dignity to say I am  sorry and move on, then we have the  responsibility under our Constitution  to remove these people from office.  He kept the information away from  this Congress. We have the responsibility of oversight. I am preparing articles of impeachment today.  ",2004

First, I want to stress my unwavering support for our men and women in  uniform.  I am absolutely convinced  that recent reports of prisoner abuses  are in no way representative of the majority of those who serve in our armed  services.

796,31,2004-05-06,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding me time.  First of all, we are all outraged by  the criminal conduct of a few. War is  not simple; war is not easy. By its nature, it is chaotic. It is an effort to find  humanity in a very inhumane environment. That is the reason for the creation of the Geneva Conventions and  the laws of war. The United States is a  signatory to the Geneva Conventions.  The United States has not violated the  Geneva  Conventions.  The  United  States is enforcing the Geneva Conventions and our laws under it. That is an  important message  for the world to  know.  The United States sets the standard  for the world. So we here in this body  need to speak in a unified voice in the  message to the world that we support  the Geneva Conventions for bringing  humane  treatment  to  individuals,  whether  they are prisoners of war,  whether they are detained civilians,  whether they are detained personnel. It  does not matter what status.  Sure, you get into the technicalities  of the law, but what is important is  they be treated humanely. There is no  justification  whatsoever  for  these  ‘‘softening up’’ of individuals for interrogations. What occurred was wrong.  This did not occur whatsoever in the  first Gulf War. I participated in interrogations. I was at the Joint Interrogation Facility. There was never even a  hint nor even a rumor with regard to  the mistreatment, abuse, or maltreatment with regards to prisoners.  What occurred here  is wrong, and  every American should be outraged.  What is important is that we recognize  there was a failure of the chain of command within the 800th MP Brigade and  that individuals need to be held accountable. The question is, where does  it go from there, whether that accountability function is strictly just of soldiers, or does it in fact move to civilian  leadership in the Pentagon?  What I do know about facts is that  facts are very stubborn things and that  facts will hold the test of time. So beyond the rhetoric, beyond any form of  allegation, beyond the spin, facts.  Mr. Speaker, it is important for this  body to speak in a unified voice; let all  of the investigations come through, let  the sun shine in, let the world know  and the facts will determine where the  accountability lies.

798,31,2004-05-06,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding time and  for his tremendous leadership on behalf  of the national security of our country.  I also thank the gentleman for his attempt to develop a bipartisan resolution that would bring us all together  and take the opportunity to send a true  message to the world of democratic  values.  Mr. Speaker,  last Thursday, Secretary Rumsfeld came to the Congress  and he briefed Members of the House of  Representatives on  the  situation  in  Iraq. He neglected to tell Members of  Congress that the situation in Iraq included this most unfortunate, disgraceful situation in the prison. He withheld  that information from the Congress of  the United States when he had  full  knowledge of it and apparently had full  knowledge for a while.  Indeed, that very evening, ‘‘60 Minutes’’ broke the story, a story it had  been working on for a while. So why  was Congress the last to know, especially on a day when the Secretary was  briefing the Congress on the situation  in Iraq?  The distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Armed Services has said  repeatedly in the course of this debate  that this information was made public  in January by a public statement by  General Kimmett. I do not know when  that constituted keeping Congress informed; and if that is the standard, if a  sentence that does not really explain  the situation expressed in a press conference in Iraq meets the standard for  informing Congress, then we are in a  lot more trouble than we even thought.  Please do not bring that up as an example of ‘‘letting us know,’’ because I  do not think anybody, even within the  administration, would have called that  sufficient notification to Congress.  Since last Thursday when the Secretary of Defense withheld information  from the Congress, the Senate has held  robust hearings. They stopped in their  tracks. They stopped the business of  the Senate, which was the reauthorization of the Defense Act, and went into  committee as the Committee on Armed  Services because of the urgency of this  matter. Yet  this House had  to be  dragged kicking and screaming  into  having hearings on  the  subject. We  should have hearings not only in the  Committee on Armed Services, but in  the Committee on International Relations. We should be having these hearings in the Committee on the Judiciary  as well. We should be having these  hearings in the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, it touches so  many jurisdictions in this House, because we must get to the bottom of  this.  So today we have this resolution that  has come to the floor, missing an opportunity to send a very clear, forceful,  values-based message to the world and  to the American people about who we  are and what we stand for and what we  will not tolerate in the behavior of our  people.  We all agree that our troops, our men  and women in uniform, and even the civilians over there, are courageous, patriotic, and have acted with great courage. They are willing to sacrifice their  lives. We owe them our deepest gratitude and respect and our prayers. This  resolution acknowledges that fact, and  it is right to do so.  Some U.S. personnel, military and civilian, abused Iraqi prisoners in ways  that are shocking and reprehensible.  The resolution acknowledges that fact  and deplores it. Unfortunately, by including a number of causes that seek  to compare life in Iraq after the invasion with conditions that existed before, the resolution creates an inference that whatever post-invasion improvements exist, somehow they mitigate the abhorrent nature of the treatment  of  the  prisoners.  These  ‘‘whereases’’ have no place in the same  resolution.  The  resolution  should  be  focused  tightly on the scandal and the need to  find out why  it occurred and who  should be held accountable. Diffusing  the focus conceals an important fact:  this scandal  increases the danger to  our troops in Iraq, makes their mission  more  difficult  to  accomplish,  and  threatens the interests of the United  States around the world. Even with a  concerted effort  in which a better-  crafted resolution could have played an  important part, it will be a very long  time before the standing of the United  States is restored in the eyes of the  world, unless we face up to this matter.  Congressional oversight of the war in  Iraq has not been aggressive enough.  The administration’s failure to provide  accountability for its policies and an  accounting of the money already provided has not been questioned adequately. Compounding that record of  inaction by not investigating this matter thoroughly will be inexcusable.  This  resolution  could have  called  clearly  for  congressional  investigations, to include a review of the role  that the U.S. civilian contractors and  other civilians may have played in it.  That suggestion was outright rejected  by the Republicans, saying we will not  include the investigation and the contractors in this resolution; we will not  add it. And it begs the question, Why?  Today, America has an opportunity  to show the world our greatness by  sending a message to the American  people and to the world that we deplore  this conduct, that we understand the  significance of these abuses in the eyes  of the Arab world, and that we will act  to uncover the facts to find out who is  responsible and to make sure that it  will never happen again.  Every opportunity we get, we will always offer our praise and gratitude to  our troops. We could have done that in  a resolution that would have had bipartisan support, because it was very important that we send a message to the  Arab world that we do understand the  significance of these abuses to them.  This is very, very, very significant; but  it has been lost in the resolution before  us.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the motion to recommit to be  offered by the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. HOYER), which delivers a  message that truly reflects America’s  values.  b1430  It does so clearly and forcefully, and  there is a reason for that.

799,38,2004-05-06,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to vote no  on this resolution. It is right to condemn the  brutal and abhorrent abuse of Iraqi prisoners.  But, this resolution is not strong enough. Without  language authorizing a  full-fledged Congressional  investigation  into  this matter, we  are failing our responsibility.  Republicans refused to allow any language  to be added to this resolution providing for an  investigation into these crimes. They have limited our ability  to bring  those responsible  to  account for their actions. This is wrong, especially when our ideals have been undermined  and our leadership again tarnished throughout  the world.  These acts of humiliation, torture and even  murder are outrageous. They are a shameful  affront to the Iraqi people and those throughout the Arab and Muslim World. As a Nation,  we owe the victims of these acts and the Iraqi  people a  full apology and  investigation  into  how these abhorrent abuses were allowed to  occur.  The torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu  Ghraib prison are part of a  larger systemic  pattern of abuse with which this administration  has been complicit. We know— as the Washington Post reported in December, 2002— that  prisoners captured in Afghanistan by the U.S.  were  transferred  to other nations  to be  tortured for information. We already are well acquainted with the mistreatment of prisoners at  Guantanamo Bay. This latest expose of torture  and abuse at the Iraqi prison is just one more  example of heinous treatment at the hands of  our Government.  We  trust  in  the honorable service of our  troops. This does not reflect on the Americans  bravely serving in Iraq. But, responsibility does  lie with those at the very top of leadership and  at the feet of this President.  It is time Congress launch an investigation  to end these patterns of abuse. If Congress  does not act to right this wrong, I do not trust  this administration will. We must condemn  these acts of  torture and abuse. Given  that  this resolution completely fails to provide Congress with the tools to initiate such investigations, I am forced to vote no.  ",2004
800,38,2004-05-06,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, I share the revulsion of my colleagues,  the House of Representatives, our friends and allies around the  world— indeed of the entire human race— over  the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers . . . or in the presence of American soldiers.  We are obliged to investigate this event; it  has given our great Nation a black eye around  the world, particularly  in  the Middle East  where our efforts have been to help them find  democracy.  We are a humanitarian nation and a signatory to the Geneva Conventions. We depend  on the protections the conventions offer to our  own POWs  . . . and we may have broken  that assurance now. We shouldn’t need  to  train our soldiers in basic humanity; the other  99.9 percent of our soldiers know this is inhuman behavior. If not for an American soldier  burdened by conscience we might not know  this today.  This is not a reflection of our professional  military— it’s an aberration. The action of the  soldiers who have candidly come  forward— even at the expense of their own careers— are  the example of our professional military, and  of  the high standards democracy demands  from those who serve in uniform. The actions  of a few have sullied the reputation of our all-  volunteer  fighting  force, our mission  in  the  larger Middle East, and  the standing of  the  United States as a democratic, humanitarian  Nation.  There is simply no excuse for this inhuman  behavior. We are a superpower; we should be  setting the example, not acting like barbarians.  I hope desperately when the investigation is  completed that it will expose the guilty parties,  each and every one, who must be punished  so the world will know that this Nation finds  this behavior aberrant.  I  thank Chairman HUNTER and Ranking  Member SKELTON for bringing this issue before  the House of Representatives today. This is  very much an American issue, not a partisan  issue. We must demand and expect that the  people— all the people— with any responsibility  for this are punished to show the world that  this  is not American. And we must never,  ever, put this irrational, inhuman behavior on  the young men and women serving honorably  in the uniformed service of the United States.  ",2004
801,38,2004-05-06,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, this Resolution falls far short of the mark of adequately  expressing the concerns I’ve heard from my  Oregon constituents and that I have myself. Its  failure to include a mechanism to hold Congress accountable and ensure that we do our  job is unacceptable.  While concurring with the sentiment of outrage expressed against these acts and deploring those responsible, this Resolution is a very  poor substitute for the oversight, fact-finding,  and policy formulations that are the duties of  this Congress. H. Res. 627 is window dressing, after the fact, and I refuse to support it.  ",2004
802,38,2004-05-06,Ms. KILPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that I find myself opposing this resolution.  I do so because it is only a half way measure  that attempts to gloss over the scope of the  problem regarding the treatment of prisoners  and detainees in Iraq.  First of all the resolution is limited to only  the situation in Iraq when we are given to understand that the problem extends to the treatment of detainees in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay.  Second,  the resolution  fails  to call on  the  administration to provide assurances that it will  treat all classes of detainees, prisoners and  enemy combatants  to  the standards established by the Geneva Convention.  Third, it does not call on the leadership of  this Congress to embark on an investigation of  these ‘ ‘abhorrent’  acts, as President Bush described this very sad episode that has left an  indelible  impression  throughout  the  Arab  world.  Fourth,  the  resolution seems  to  limit accountability  to  those  in our Armed Services,  principally the enlisted ranks of our Army, and  exculpates those higher-level officers and civilian authorities within the chain of command.  Fifth, the resolution says nothing about investigating  civilian,  private  military  firms  (PMFs) who are working under contract with  the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). The  CPA has relied on PMFs to perform security  functions that are normally performed by U.S.  military personnel, including logistical support,  interrogation of prisoners,  convoy  security,  guarding vital  facilities and personnel, and  more.  Sixth,  the resolution  fails  to hold Defense  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accountable. The  day the story broke about the abuses of Iraqi  prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison Secretary  Rumsfeld was briefing the Senate and made  no mention of  the problem.  I  find myself  in  agreement with Sen. JOHNMCCAINof Arizona  that there is a lack of communication between  the administration and the Congress when it  comes to the issue of Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld is responsible for that lack of communication and  this  resolution  is evidence enough  that  the  leadership of  this Congress  is covering for him. I join with others in calling for  the Secretary’s resignation.  The Washington Post  is  right on  target  when  it said:  ‘The Pentagon ruled  that  the  United States would no longer be bound by  the Geneva Convention, that Army regulations  on the interrogation of prisoners would not be  observed; and that many detainees would be  held  incommunicado and without any  independent mechanism of review.’ This administration has mastered the art of  deniability. No one has been held accountable. It is time we hold the Secretary of Defense to account and ask for his resignation.  For these reasons, I cast my vote in opposition to this resolution.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  SIMPSON). All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 628,  the resolution is considered read for  amendment, and the previous question  is ordered.  MOTIONTORECOMMITOFFEREDBYMR. HOYER  ",2004

815,45,2004-05-06,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I do take  some exception, and I am here to speak  on another subject, but as the author  of the discount card, I find it very practical, very reasonable, and very meaningful for seniors in my district, the  fifth  largest Medicare-eligible  population in America. We will get on that  at another time.  Why I am here today is obviously  having read the Roll Call this morning  and seen the headlines, I am furious by  the remarks that were attributed to  one of my colleagues that said the war  in Iraq is unwinnable.  ‘‘Unwinnable’’  was the comment made.  What is more mind-boggling is the  remarks are attributed to someone who  has served this Nation as a veteran  during the Vietnam War conflict, and  we respect him immensely for his service to this country.  There are some, though, in this process who have recently spoken in the  national media comparing this conflict  to Vietnam. I find the comparison absurd. It is also deliberately partisan  rhetoric.  But if there is one lesson we should  have learned from Vietnam that should  carry over here in this Chamber today,  it is that disparaging what our soldiers  are doing in Iraq is tantamount to giving comfort to the terrorists and comfort to the enemy.  Saying this conflict  is unwinnable  will make no difference one way or the  other to what we do in Iraq, but it has  a devastating effect on American men  and women who are in Iraq now doing  what we in this Congress have asked  them to do. Congress voted on a resolution to go into Iraq. We are there. We  have sent more troops there to bring  peace and democracy to Iraq. We are  not risking our lives as Members of  Congress; they are, as will the thousands of other Americans who may follow to bring liberty to Iraq.  Whether anyone here agrees or disagrees with the reasons we went to Iraq  in the first place, the simple fact is  that we are there now and we have to  accomplish the goals that free Iraqis  are asking of us.  We are fighting terrorism at its doorstep. If someone disagrees with that, so  be it. But no one should ever forget  that what they say has a direct impact  on the men and women who are in Iraq  at our behest.  To tell them they are over there risking their life and limb for something  unwinnable is just unbelievable. On a  very basic level, it is like a coach telling his team of Little Leaguers that  they do not have a chance of winning  the game, but go out there and play  anyway. Let us waste some time.  I know that is a poor analogy, because we are not talking about Little  League. This is the big league. This is  life and death. This is America’s finest  young men and women serving this  country.  For that reason alone, I find it stunning that anyone in this body could say  something that will have absolutely no  effect, other than to undercut the morale of our troops in Iraq and cheer on  the terrorists.  I went to a funeral in my district of  a young man who was killed in Iraq 2  weeks before he was to return home  and marry his high school sweetheart.  It was a very, very tearful day for everyone in the room.  When I approached his parents, I felt  remorse, obviously, because I had voted  to send their child to that place. They  did not  look at me with bitterness.  They were proud of their son. They  were proud he died doing what he wanted to do since he was a little boy, and  that was defend the flag that flies over  this building.  I did not sacrifice anything in Iraq,  but these people did. They knew that  the cause that their son perished under  was just and was noble and was right.  For him and all the others who have  perished in this conflict, these kinds of  words of ‘‘unwinnable’’ are simply political rhetoric designed to influence  the outcome of this next election.  But  I urge all of my colleagues,  Democrats and Republicans and citizens alike, while there are people in  harm’s way from this country in that  nation and everywhere on the globe, we  respect that, and let us not make their  burden more difficult by giving the  enemy even an inkling that they may  be winning. That succeeded in Spain  during this recent election by bombing  a train and killing people.  Those that say that they were attacked  simply  because  the Spanish  were in Iraq have not looked at the entirety of what is happening. Jordanians  are being attacked, if you will. There  were plans to attack their intelligence  service. Saudi Arabia was the target  last week of a terrorist attack. These  things are happening because of terrorists, not because of Iraq, but because  they want to undo the way of life that  we respect.  So I take umbrage with the comments that this is unwinnable, and I  ask us all to join in salute for our  strong, brave men and women in the  field.  f  IRAQ WAR ACCOUNTABILITY AND  LACK  OF  OVERSIGHT  IN  THE  HOUSE  ",2004

817,45,2004-05-06,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague who previously  spoke, and I really do not understand  why he says what he says. There is no  reason why any Member of this House  of Representatives should not speak  the truth. The Iraq war is unwinnable,  it has been a total failure, and if we  recognize that fact, then we will not  continue to make the same mistakes.  Now,  that  is not  to  suggest  that  there is not an exit strategy or a way  of leaving Iraq that will not accomplish some goals and that will not perhaps make the situation for the Iraqis  better. But for us to sit around here  and suggest that somehow the conduct  of this war by the President or the Vice  President or the Secretary of Defense  is helping the cause is simply not true,  and we have to speak out and say that.  Since the very beginning, with its refusal to truly internationalize the war,  the Bush administration has  shown  nothing but arrogance towards anyone  outside its inner-circle, whether that  be Congress or the international community; and, unfortunately, the administration is now paying the price and  our U.S. troops in Iraq are paying with  their lives.

824,80,2004-05-06,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  rise today to speak about a subject  that is dear to the heart of the Chair  because Alaska contains much of the  energy that the United States needs.  Yesterday, crude oil closed at $39.57 on  the New York Exchange. Nationwide,  the average price of gasoline is $1.84,  expected to rise 5 to 10 cents over the  next several days, and even more as we  enter the summer driving season which  begins on Memorial Day.  Natural gas prices are also at a  record high for this year, 70 percent  higher than they were a year ago. We  are  increasingly  dependent  on  imported supplies to set prices. In the Pacific Northwest, the snowpack is at 50  percent  of  average,  and  so  hydroelectric generation will be at a record  low this summer.  We currently import 55 percent of our  oil. We will depend upon 70 percent for  our demand by 2025. Meanwhile, we are  experiencing  record  temperatures  in  southern  California  where  already  there is a strain on the region’s electricity system.  I do not know what sort of psychological barriers need to be broken in  the Senate to finally pass comprehensive energy  legislation. We are very  close to breaking through every psychological barrier  related  to energy  policy. Oil will soon cost $40 a barrel.  Gasoline will be over $2 a gallon. Natural gas will be permanently over $5  per MCF and the adequacy of our electricity generating grid this summer is  now a simple calculus. Will it be hotter  than usual? Because if so, we will have  blackouts again.  My colleagues will notice that I no  longer believe that our growing dependence on imported oil will have the  psychological impact necessary to motivate my colleagues into action on the  Energy  bill.  For my  part,  I  am  alarmed. I see us becoming 70-percent  dependent on imported oil. I read of  terrorist threats against overseas oil  infrastructure and  refining capacity,  and I am amazed that I have colleagues  who want to stop building our emergency supplies in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or, even worse, call on us  to use up those reserves now. In the  past, the result of such activity was  miniscule in terms of its impact on  gasoline prices. It is just something to  talk about. It is not something that  will do anything.  Instead, yesterday a number of Senators came to the floor and called on  the President to pressure OPEC to increase production and reduce prices.  Does anybody assume he has not already done that? Does anybody assume  they are  interested  in what we say  today? It would be terrific  if OPEC  would do that, but I have to ask my  colleagues, why would OPEC take us  seriously? OPEC sees us for what we  are. We are hooked and we cannot even  do the most incremental steps to begin  to address this plight.  OPEC sees a Congress that has talked  about passing an energy bill  for 10  years. They see a Congress that has  failed every year for the last 3 years to  pass an energy bill. OPEC  sees an  America that lacks the political will to  address  its  own  crisis.  Instead, we  blame and complain. If you were OPEC,  would you take us seriously?  Some say passing an energy bill will  not do a lot for foreign crude oil prices.  I disagree. I think passing the  first  comprehensive energy bill to come out  of this Congress in 12 years sends a  strong signal to oil-producing nations.  I think if we do more to conserve energy, increase production, diversify our  energy supply, we will tell OPEC America is a country with unity, commitment, and the political will to address  our most  serious domestic problem,  and that is our energy challenges.  If Senate Democrats mean what they  say when they wring their hands and  lament the rising oil prices, pass this  bill.

828,94,2004-05-06,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak to the Negroponte nomination.  Let me begin where I end up: I think  we owe Ambassador Negroponte and  his wife Diana, quite frankly, a debt of  gratitude. It takes political courage,  physical courage, and moral courage to  take  on  this  assignment.  I  cannot  think in my years in the Senate of a  circumstance where we have placed an  individual into a position where the degree of difficulty in accomplishing his  mission has been as high and  the  stakes  as  profound  as Ambassador  Negroponte is being positioned now.  It is unusual, in all my years here of  speaking to and voting on the Ambassadorships and positions of the State  Department,  for me to start off by  thanking the nominee for being willing  to take on this responsibility.  Although the circumstance we find  ourselves in in Iraq, I think, is still redeemable, the degree of difficulty in  accomplishing our mission has been  made extraordinarily more difficult by  the events of the past year and particularly by the revelations of the past several days.  Let me define at the outset once  again—and I apologize to my friend and  my chairman for having to hear me say  this again and again and again and  again and again—what I would consider  to constitute success, what our mission  is. For me—and I have said this from  before we went  in, and consistently  since then—it is leaving the Iraqi people with a representative government  of their choosing that is secure within  its own borders and poses no threat to  its neighbors and does not possess or  seek to possess weapons of mass destruction or harbor terrorists. That is  difficult but doable. It is my hope that  if we are able to help the Iraqi people  accomplish that,  in time they could  build political and economic institutions that we would recognize as a liberal democracy. But I want to make it  clear what I believe the test of success  or failure is.  Unfortunately, the Negroponte nomination has been swamped by the debate  and the crisis we now face in Iraq and  in the Middle East. So it is necessary  to talk about the policy in Iraq more  than about the personality of the individual we are about to put in place to  carry out American policy.  As complicated as Iraq seems, in one  sense it is fairly simple. We have three  basic options as a nation. One, we can  continue to try to seek the objective I  have stated, or even a broader objective of liberal democratization on the  western model as some in the administration state, by ourselves in the hope  that more of the same of we have been  prescribing will bring about success.  Or we can conclude—as some have in  this body, although they have refrained  from stating it; as some have in the  American public, and they have stated  it; and as some serious press people and  political pundits and think-tank types  have—that this is not doable, meaning  the objective  I stated, and that we  should figure out how, as rapidly as  possible, to  leave Iraq before  it  implodes.  There is a third option, which seems  to me the only rational option, notwithstanding the fact that the degree  of difficulty has increased; and that is,  we can get the Iraqi people more engaged and the world’s major powers to  help us invest in helping the Iraqi people accomplish the goal of self-government. Nothing, in my view, from this  point on will be easy—nothing. Not a  single aspect of this undertaking will  be easy.  The chairman and I, from different  perspectives, independently have been  characterized as critics of administration policy. We both voted for this. We  both, in differing degrees, but I think  on balance in agreement, laid out—this  is not 20/20 hindsight—how difficult we  thought the task would be before we  went in, and the predicates that should  have been laid down to increase the  prospects of success before we went in,  and have independently, together and  with others, from the moment we went  in, met privately, publicly, within the  committee and through our personal  relationship, with administration officials and others, argued for a different  approach or a ratcheting up of the effort in Iraq in a way that could and  would allow for legitimacy for whatever government  came  forward and  more security on the ground. Because  security is a precondition, in my view,  for getting the Iraqi people into a position where they are willing to take the  risk—and there will be risk—of raising  their heads in an effort to form a government that is not an Iranian model  and not a strongman model.  This has been made more difficult by  the fact that, in my view—speaking for  myself only—we have squandered every  opportunity since the statue of Saddam  was pulled down by ropes. Since that  moment we have  squandered  every  major opportunity we have had to get  this endeavor on the right track.  I  want to make clear for anyone who is  listening that an incredibly large dose  of humility is in order for anyone who  stands and suggests that they know the  answer in Iraq. I am not suggesting  that I know with any degree of certainty whether the prescription that I  and others laid out in detail in July,  August and September the year before  we went to war, in innumerable speeches and presentations on  the Senate  floor and other places since we went to  war, whether if had every single thing  that I and others had suggested been  done, I could guarantee the American  public I am certain we would succeed.  This  is an  incredible undertaking.  There has been no time in the history  of the modern nation state where what  we are attempting to do in that region  of the world has succeeded.  As  I  said  to Ambassador Bremer,  when Mr. Talwar and I were there a few  months after Saddam fell: ‘‘Mr. Ambassador, I want you to understand that I  believe  if  the Lord Almighty came  down and gave you the absolute correct  answer to the first 20 major decisions  you have to make, you still only have  a 65 percent of getting this right.’’  I want to make clear, I understand  this is a difficult deal. I understand  that mistakes would be made no matter who had been President, no matter  who had been in charge. But I do think  we put ourselves in a position where we  started  off  this  occupation  having  made three very fundamental mistakes  that have to be corrected.  One, we can correct. I believe the administration significantly exaggerated  the imminence of the threat posed by  Saddam, thereby squandering an opportunity to build the international consensus we needed, not to win the war  but secure the peace. Committee reports we wrote, Democrats and Republicans  in  the committee,  repeatedly  started off  saying: We do not need  international help to win the war, but  it will be essential  in winning  the  peace.  As a consequence of the exaggeration  of the threat in terms of how imminent  it was, we squandered the opportunity  to isolate the French and the Germans,  who I believe were taking advantage of  President Bush’s misstatements and/or  mistakes—unfairly taking advantage.  We  lost and  squandered  the opportunity to isolate them and, as a consequence of that, at the same time to  generate much broader  international  support so when we did go, there was a  genuine coalition; that there was more  legitimacy  for the undertaking  from  the outset.  The second serious mistake we made  is going in with too few forces, squandering the opportunity to wipe out the  Republican Guard, to prevent looting  and street crime, to secure nearly 1  million tons of weapons that are now  being used against our troops that were  left in open depots, to avoid a security  vacuum that  is now being  filled by  common  criminals,  insurgents  and  rogue militias, and outside  ‘‘foreign  fighters.’’ It was not as if this was not  a topic of debate before we went. The  way we treated and approached the  Turks when we wanted the 4th ID to  come through, the arrogance of suggesting that we didn’t need that, we  could still move anyway. What would  be the status, I ask my friend from  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:43 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S06MY4.REC S06MY4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
829,108,2004-05-06,Mr. HARKIN.," We are all upset about  what happened. Our country was founded on the principles of democracy, the  inalienable rights of  individuals. We  were right to condemn Saddam Hussein  for his state-sponsored torture in Iraq.  We  are  right  to  condemn  anyone,  whether it is in Uganda or those who  led the Rwandan massacre, the generals who now run Burma, or those who  set up the Soviet gulags during that  long cold war where so many were tortured and killed by the Soviets. We  have always been right to speak out  against those and to do what we can to  uphold the inalienable rights of individuals. We are not perfect. No country  is; no individual is. But our obligation  is to make sure that when this country  makes a mistake, we right it. We don’t  try to cover it up. We don’t try to excuse it. We bring it out, show it for  what it is, and then institute policies,  programs, procedures  to make  sure  that human rights abuses under our  watch will never happen again.  The bravery of our men and women  in Iraq, under intolerable conditions, is  a source of pride to all of us. As Senator KENNEDYsaid, what has happened  with  these  pictures,  these  terrible  human rights abuses, I believe, has to  pain our wonderful young men and  women in uniform more than it pains  us. Most of them, I am sure, are as abhorred by this as we are. I know they  are wondering how something like this  could have happened. It has to be demoralizing for our military as it is demoralizing for us. That is why 34 years  ago, when the pictures of the tiger  cages came out, it led to reforms. I believe it helped lead to the end of that  terrible  conflict  in  Vietnam  and  brought our troops home.  I hope these pictures, as awful as  they are, about what happened in the  Abu Ghraib prison, will now provoke us  to act, to straighten out the system, to  make sure this does not happen again.

833,108,2004-05-06,Mr. HARKIN.,"  I  believe  that  our  President has to apologize to the Iraqi  people. He went on television yesterday. As I understand from all the articles I read, he gave a slight slap on the  wrist to Secretary Rumsfeld and said  he still supported him.  I am sorry.  Sometimes  it takes a big person to  admit wrong and to apologize. I believe  that is what we need to do for the Iraqi  people, to let them know, not by words  but by deeds, that this does not reflect  who we are as a people. We are better  than that. We are bigger than that.  Because of what has happened, because of the pall this has cast over our  involvement in Iraq, for those reasons  and for the history of John Negroponte  and what he did during his tenure in  Honduras during a time of gross violations of human rights, he should not be  the highest ranking diplomat in Iraq. I  suppose the skids are greased for him  to get this appointment. But I don’t  think there are too many here who remember Mr. Negroponte and what he  did in Honduras, but I don’t forget. I  don’t  forget what happened there.  I  don’t forget that Mr. Negroponte was  one of those individuals closely aligned  with General Gustavo Alvarez and Battalion 316. I don’t forget that it was Mr.  Negroponte who turned a blind eye and  a deaf ear to the human rights abuses  in Honduras at that time.  So to send Mr. Negroponte to Iraq  would send entirely the wrong message  at this time.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and  suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2004

845,108,2004-05-06,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, at  5  o’clock we are going to vote on whether to confirm Mr. Negroponte to be our  Ambassador. I want to make clear a  couple of points. I voted against Mr.  Negroponte for the very issues Senator  talked about  in his history  when he was in Latin America, during  what I believed to be a massive coverup  of human  rights abuses, which was  very troubling. When Mr. Negroponte  went there, there was a meeting with  him and I said: You are now in a new  job, and although I am not voting for  you, I want to work with you. We did  work  together on a  treaty banning  child  soldiers. He worked very well  with us on that. There were times when  I called him to talk about issues of  concern and he was very accommodating.  I am going to vote for him today to  give him another chance at a job that  is so dangerous and so worrisome, because we have a policy in Iraq that is  not working. He is willing to go there.  I give him tremendous credit for that  and I give credit to his family. I also  think his ties with people in the United  Nations, as we try to get more nations  involved, could be helpful. I am not  sure, but it could be helpful.  I want to express my reservation,  now that we see on the agenda of the  United States of America one of the  worst scandals I think we have seen in  a very long time—this prison scandal,  which has  such  enormous  ramifications. As one of my colleagues said, it  has undone a  thousand gestures of  kindness and goodness our troops have  demonstrated to the Iraqi people and  to the people of Afghanistan.  People say, Senator, you should not  vote for Mr. Negroponte because now  we have this other human rights scandal. Well, I feel Mr. Negroponte knows  we  are  watching  everything  now.  America has a way of getting to the  truth. The other day I made a speech  about making sure that truth will not  be a casualty of this war. We need to  know the truth. I can tell you, I have  never seen anything uglier.  When the press came to me and asked  how  I  am  going  to  vote  for Mr.  Negroponte, I said I want to give him  this opportunity. I also feel we ought  to be  looking to the Commander  in  Chief right now.  It isn’t Mr. Negroponte who is responsible for what has gone on here.

852,122,2004-05-06,Mr. BREAUX.," I probably should not  be getting into this because I have not  looked at  it, but  it seems that the  sense of the resolution is the prison  should be destroyed. I do not think it  was so much a problem with the prison  as it was with people who ran the prison. It is not the physical plant that  caused the problem. It is the people  who were running the prison.  If we do demolish a prison, are we not  going to have to build another one? It  seems to me what we ought to be advocating is not the demolishing of the  prison but the replacement of the people who were running the prison with  professional  people who  understand  how to treat prisoners.  The  problem  is not  the  physical  plant. The problem is the people running it. I am sort of concerned if we demolish the prison we are going to have  to end up building another one because  we are going to have prisoners who are  going to have to be dealt with over  there.  ",2004
853,122,2004-05-06,Mr. CRAIG.," The Senator from Louisiana makes an excellent point. There  will be a need for a prison to detain  people. This is a very large complex. It  is also phenomenally symbolic of the  evil of Saddam Hussein where within  those walls  literally  thousands  of  Iraqis were killed. It was known as the  death center. Symbolically what we do  is very important. Tragically, what we  have done or allowed to happen is very  important. I think what the Senator  from Nebraska and I are saying is, let  us look at the death chambers themselves and tell the Iraqi people those  chambers will no longer stand. I believe that is an important expression.  Words are one thing; actions are clearly another. I believe symbolically what  we say today, or what the Senate of the  United States could say and should  say, is important.  ",2004
854,122,2004-05-06,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Mr. President, my response to my friend from  Louisiana is if this had been a prison,  I would say let us continue it as a prison and change simply the administration, the prison guards. But  it was  never a prison. It was a place of abuse  and  atrocity,  a  death  chamber  for  thousands and thousands of Iraqi citiThe  OFFICER.  zens. So it is not a prison, and it never  was converted into a prison, apparently  not even during the time that we have  been able to administer it.  ",2004

860,122,2004-05-06,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Illinois.  ,2004
861,122,2004-05-06,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I  listened carefully to this debate by my  colleagues. We can join in the debate  as to whether the destruction of the  building is an appropriate symbol of  our shame and outrage at what happened to the Iraqi prisoners. The fact  is, after the invasion, this Saddam Hussein torture chamber or prison was extensively remodeled by the U.S. taxpayers. Tearing it down will, as the  Senator from Louisiana suggests, result in the need to build another at the  expense of the U.S. taxpayers.  If this symbol, though, can move us  any closer to expressing our sense of  outrage and shame to the people of  Iraq and to the Arab and Muslim nations around the world, then that expense, as  far as I am concerned,  is  money well spent. I am open to that  suggestion.  I would like to reflect for a moment  on  the  larger  issue  that has  been  raised, not just in this Chamber today  but around the world over the last several days. As a member of the Senate  Intelligence Committee, yesterday  I  spent several hours in a hearing with  representatives of our military and civilian agencies involved in Iraq, where  we poured over every gruesome, grisly,  sickening detail of this abuse of Iraqi  prisoners. I cannot disclose what was  said in that room. What I am about to  say is based exclusively on those public  pronouncements and things that have  been available in the press. I want to  make that clear at the outset.  I will tell you about yesterday.  I  can’t remember a sadder day in my  service  in Congress than the time I  spent  in that  intelligence room. To  think any human being would do that  to another person is unthinkable. To  think that an American would be involved  in that  is something I never  would have believed. And to imagine  that someone wearing the uniform of  our country would have been in some  way associated with that activity is  something I would never, ever have accepted. Yet it is a reality, and the reality is it was not one isolated incident. It was a series of incidents involving the killing of prisoners, the sadistic, wanton, and blatant mistreatment of prisoners, and it is something  which,  sadly,  this United States of  America must face up to.  I am glad the President of the United  States went on Arab television yesterday to express his personal  feelings  about how terrible these events were,  and to make it clear that America does  not accept this conduct. I wish the  President had extended an apology to  the Iraqi people and all who were offended by  this  shameful episode.  It  would have been an easy thing for him  to do. It would have expressed a sense  of humanity and a sense of  justice,  which we expect of an American President. He did not. I wish he had.  But now we have to ask ourselves  how should we, as a people, react to  this? I am going to suggest one way we  should not react to this. I have in my  hand a transcript from a syndicated  radio  program  of May  4,  by Rush  Limbaugh. Oh, he is well known around  Washington, around the world. I want  to read what Mr. Limbaugh said in reaction to this scandalous episode involving the torture and abuse of Iraqi  prisoners.  His caller, on May 4, asked as follows:  It was like a college fraternity prank that  stack up naked men.  And Mr. Limbaugh replied as follows:  Exactly. Exactly my point! This is no different than what happens at skull and bones  initiation and we’re going to ruin people’s  lives over it and we’re going to hamper our  military effort, and then we are going to  really hammer them because they had a good  time. You know, these people are being fired  at every day. I’m talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard  of emotional release?  Rush Limbaugh  said  in describing  the sadistic torture of Iraqi prisoners.  And then Mr. Limbaugh, in his infinite  wisdom, went on to say:  You ever heard of need to blow some steam  off?  Rush Limbaugh. I am embarrassed  that this man, who supposedly speaks  for so many people in America and is  listened to faithfully by so many people in America, would be so callous, so  insensitive as  to make  those  statements. Trust me, they will be repeated,  not just on the floor of the Senate, but  around the world by our enemies as an  indication that we are not taking this  seriously.  President Bush struck the right note  yesterday. We  are  taking  this  extremely seriously, and we should. The  reason is obvious. What happened in  those  prison  cells was  a  complete  breakdown of  leadership, a complete  breakdown of discipline. It is clear that  some are being held accountable for it  already, and  the  investigation  continues. Some of my colleagues have  come to the floor and said this investigation should go all the way to the  top. I will keep an open mind on that  issue. I want the Secretary of Defense  to have his day in court, his moment to  explain when he learned of this and  what he did about it; frankly, what action he took to avoid this from occurring.  But there are several things I think  we should keep in mind.

862,129,2004-05-06,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr.  President,  there is good news from Georgia this  morning. In a second bloodless revolution in that country, former Soviet official and Ajaria troublemaker Alan  Abashidze fled into exile after thousands  of  opponents—including  some  from within his own police and military forces—took to the streets to demand change.  Abashidze’s  hasty  departure  is  a  great victory for the people of Georgia  and their leaders, particularly President Saakashvili and Prime Minister  Zhvania. By seeking a non-violent solution to the crisis in the breakaway  region  of  Ajari,  Saakashvili  and  Zhvania demonstrated patience in the  face  of  Abashidze’s  hostile  provocations—designed to spark a military  conflict.  Reports of the celebrations  in the  streets of Batumi are inspiring, particularly  those of  reformers waving  American flags along side their own  country.  I want to remind my colleagues such symbolism is a reality in  Iraq, where Georgian  soldiers  serve  alongside U.S. and Coalition forces.  My message to the people of Georgia  is clear: America will continue to stand  with them as they champion the cause  of democracy. We will continue to help  them  build  a  country—and  institutions—dedicated to the furtherance of  freedom and the rule of law.  Once again, democracy triumphs in  Georgia.  f  MILLION MOM MARCH  ",2004
863,129,2004-05-06,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, this weekend moms from across the country will  converge on Washington to join in a  march remembering gun violence victims and urging President Bush to support commonsense gun safety legislation. I am proud to support the moms,  and I know my colleagues will join me  in commending these women for their  leadership.  On Mother’s Day, moms will gather  on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol to  bring their ‘‘Halt the Assault’’ message  to the front door of Congress. These  women have come to Washington to  urge Members of Congress to support  sensible gun safety legislation. Their  leadership is desperately needed on this  issue, and I applaud all of the moms  who will make this journey for their  commitment. After  the march,  the  moms will spend Monday visiting our  offices and urging us to support commonsense gun safety legislation.  One of the moms attending this Sunday’s events is Barb Case, Michigan’s  Million Mom March President. Mrs.  Case has been a member of the Michigan Million Mom March since it first  started in 2000. She will be leading as  many as 500 Michigan moms to Washington. The Michigan moms will be  marching in memory of the 120,000 people who have been killed by a firearm,  including more than 13,000 children and  teens, since 2000. Mrs. Case, along with  other moms in Michigan, have united  with State and local leaders to implement community efforts to address the  tough issues surrounding gun violence  in my home State of Michigan. And,  Barb has organized Michigan’s moms  trip to Washington every year since  the first march took place in 2000.  This year’s marchers are focused on  the renewal and strengthening of the  assault weapons ban, holding gun manufacturers accountable for their products, requiring background checks on  all gun purchases, reinstating the 5-day  Brady waiting period for all gun purchases, and incorporating safety standards into gun design.  Michigan’s moms, just like millions  of moms from across the country want  an America where their kids are safe  from gun violence. Again, I commend  all of the mothers coming to Washington  this weekend  for  their hard  work and commitment to the issue of  gun safety and I hope all of my colleagues will  remember  these efforts  when the Senate considers gun safety  legislation in the coming months.  I ask unanimous consent that an article  from  the Detroit Free Press,  which discussed the issue of gun violence and  this Sunday’s march, be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Detroit Free Press, Apr. 29, 2004]  WORKTOWARDPEACETHISMOTHER’SDAY  (By Desiree Cooper)  Sometimes, society’s assault on your humanity can be so fierce, you have to throw  down the gauntlet and say,  ‘‘This means  war.’’  That’s what happened to two women more  than 140 years ago. One was Anna Reeves  Jarvis, a West Virginia Methodist pastor’s  wife. She established Mother’s Day Work  Clubs to improve the health of Appalachian  women and children. But as Civil War casualties mounted, she converted the clubs  into nursing squads, determined to save the  lives of all soldiers—both Confederate and  Union.  Abolitionist Julia Ward Howe, author of  the ‘‘Battle Hymn of the Republic,’’ also had  become war-weary. When the Franco-Prussian War began on the heels of the Civil War,  she started rallying women for a national  Mother’s Day for Peace. Together, the nurse  and the poet began the antiwar holiday that  we know as Mother’s Day.  NOTABOUTDAISIESANDDINNER  We’ve long since forgotten that Mother’s  Day was a social movement. But this year,  Endolyn Chapman and her daughter Tonisha  will hark back to the roots of the holiday  and celebrate it on May 9 at the Million  Mom March in Washington, DC.  Neither woman has ever seen herself as political. Tonisha, 19, just registered to vote  last week. But, like Jarvis and Howe, violence has spurred their fight for peace.  ‘‘The last time I saw my father, he was  driving away as I was coming home,’’ said  Tonisha, remembering the even on April 5,  2004.‘‘I wanted to stop and chat with him,  but he just waved and drove off.’’  That night, 44-year old Steven Chapman  went to Detroit’s Sa-Mari Hand Car Wash on  Wyoming and 6 Mile.  ‘‘Four men wearing ski masks robbed the  place,’’ said Endolyn, who’d been married to  Chapman—a former college football player  who stood 6 feet 6 and wore a size 18 shoe—  for nearly 20 years. ‘‘My husband pleaded for  his life. He was in a seated position when  they killed him.’’  HOWWILLYOUCOMMITFORPEACE?  Tonisha has tried to comfort her mother,  taking her out on her parents’ anniversary.  Endolyn, too, has tried to move on, even  though her husband’s killers remain at large.  Then she read an article about the Million  Mom March’s Halt the Assault rally to urge  Congress to renew the assault weapons ban.  ‘‘There  is no reason why anyone would  need an assault weapon,’’ Endolyn said. ‘‘You  can’t hunt with one. I decided that we’d go  to the march because we don’t ever want another family to go through what we’ve been  through.’’  Million Man Marchstate president Barb  Case  said,  ‘‘So many women have been  touched by the suffering of others and want  to do something to change the world.’’ She  estimated that about 500 people from Michigan will attend the march. ‘‘This is a powerful way for them to get involved.  And what better day to demonstrate that  power than Mother’s Day.  ",2004
864,129,2004-05-06,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President, tens  of thousands of women will come to  Washington this Mother’s Day weekend  to spread the word about the urgent  need  to  renew  the Federal  assault  weapons ban.  I thank these women, and their families and friends who will join them, for  their effort to focus the American public on the fact that we could lose this  important law unless Congress and the  President renew the ban soon.  I ask these committed Americans to  do everything they can do to help save  the assault weapons ban. They should  write the President and urge him to  help renew the ban. They should write  Senate Majority Leader BILLFRISTand  Speaker of the House DENNISHASTERT  and urge them to bring the assault  weapons ban up for a vote. They should  make their voices heard until the ban  is renewed.  Time is running out. The Federal assault weapons ban will expire on September 13 of this year if Congress and  the President do not act. This means  that AK–47s, TEC-DC 9s, Street Sweepers, and dozens of other types of military-style assault weapons will once  again flood the streets of America. We  cannot afford to let this happen. We  owe the American people more than  that. It is just that simple.  Assault weapons pose a grave threat  to all Americans, but most especially  to law enforcement officers on our city  streets.  Just last month, I spoke at the funeral of San Francisco Police Officer  Isaac Espinoza, who was  shot  and  killed by a gang member armed with  an AK–47 and a 30-round clip. Officer  Espinoza took three shots in his back  as a gunman fired 15 rounds in just seconds, giving Officer Espinoza and his  partner, who was also shot, no time to  seek refuge.

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954);  Whereas in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), the Supreme Court  upheld the doctrine of ‘‘separate but equal’’,  which allowed the continued segregation of  common carriers, and, by extension, of public schools, in the United States based on  race;  Whereas racial segregation and the doctrine of ‘‘separate but equal’’ resulted in separate schools, housing, and public accommodations that were inferior and unequal for  African-Americans and many other minorities, severely limited the educational opportunities of generations of racial minorities,  negatively impacted the lives of the people  of the United States, and inflicted severe  harm on American society;  Whereas  in 1945, Mexican-American students in California successfully challenged  the constitutionality of their segregation on  the basis of national origin in Westminster  School District of Orange County v. Mendez  (161 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1947));  Whereas in 1951, Oliver Brown, on behalf of  his daughter Linda Brown, an African-American  third grader,  filed  suit against  the  Board of Education of Topeka after Linda  was denied admission to an all-white public  school in Topeka, Kansas;  Whereas in 1952, the Supreme Court combined Oliver Brown’s case (Brown v. Board of  Education of Topeka, 98 F. Supp. 797 (D. Kan.  1951)) with  similar  cases  from Delaware  (Gebhart v. Belton, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952)),  South Carolina (Briggs v. Elliott, 98 F. Supp.  529 (E.D.S.C. 1951)), and Virginia (Davis v.  County School Board  of Prince Edward  County, 103 F. Supp. 337 (E.D. Va. 1952)) challenging racial segregation in education and  determined that the constitutionality of segregation in public schools in the District of  Columbia would be considered separately in  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954);  Whereas the students in these cases argued  that the inequality caused by the segregation of public schools was a violation of their  right to equal protection under the law;  Whereas on May 17, 1954, in Brown v. Board  of Education of Topeka, the Supreme Court  overturned the decision of Plessy v. Ferguson, concluding that ‘‘in the field of public  education,  the doctrine of  ‘separate but  equal’ has no place’’ and, on that same date,  in Bolling v. Sharpe, held that the doctrine  of  ‘‘separate but equal’’ also violated the  fifth amendment to the Constitution; and  Whereas the decision in Brown v. Board of  Education of Topeka is of national importance and profoundly affected all people of  the United States by outlawing racial segregation in education and providing a foundation on which to build greater equality:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) recognizes and honors May 17, 2004, as  the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court  decision in Brown v. Board of Education of  Topeka;  (2) encourages all people of the United  States to recognize the importance of the  Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of  Education of Topeka; and  (3) acknowledges the need for the Nation to  recommit to the goals and purposes of this  landmark decision  to  finally  realize  the  dream of equal educational opportunity for  all children of the United States.  f  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V.

876,164,2004-05-06,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, it  gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of the passage of S. Con. Res. 102,  which honours the 50th anniversary of  the landmark Supreme Court decision,  Brown et al. v. Board of Education of  Topeka, Kansas et al.  As you may know, the history of desegregating our public school system  started before Brown with such cases  as Murray v. Maryland and Sweatt v.  Painter. But it was Brown v. Board of  Education  that  caught  fire  and  changed the course of Americas history  and the way in which we view equality  in the eyes of the law.  Before Brown, many States held and  enforced racially segregated laws enforced, which was an atrocious practice. Many individuals cited the 1896  Plessy v. Ferguson case, which sanctioned the separate but equal doctrine,  as the grounds for keeping school segregation legal.  Oliver Brown, a citizen of Topeka,  KS, along with other individuals, filed  a lawsuit against the Topeka School  Board  on  behalf  of  his  7-year-old  daughter, Linda. Like other young African Americans, Linda had to cross a  set of railroad tracks and board a bus  to take her to the ‘‘colored’’ school on  the other side of the city from where  she  lived—even though a school  for  white children was located only a few  blocks from her home.  There were many notable African  Americans who helped to bring this  case  to  the United States Supreme  Court; however, none so famous as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall,  who  valiantly  defended  the  rights of not only Linda Brown and the  other defendants in the case, but of an  entire race of  individuals who were  treated as second class citizens.  On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court  rendered its decision to rule racial segregation  in schools unconstitutional.  Further, the Supreme Court found the  ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine to be in  violation of the 14th amendment of the  United  States  Constitution,  which  states, among other things, that, ‘‘no  State shall make or enforce any law  which shall abridge the privileges or  immunities of citizens of the United  States.’’  When the Court ruled, in 1954, that  school segregation laws were unconstitutional,  the Supreme Court demolished the legal foundation on which racial  segregation  stood. The Court’s  opinion, written and delivered by Chief  Justice Earl Warren, also served as a  stirring moral indictment of racial segregation, and an eloquent challenge to  America to cast off its prejudices and  extend its promises of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness to all citizens,  regardless of race or color.  I would like to take this opportunity  to thank the many  individuals who  worked tirelessly to ensure that the  50th anniversary celebration of  this  case is recognized world wide. Most notably, I would  like to thank Cheryl  Brown Henderson, the Brown Foundation and the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site for their  steadfast and unwavering commitment  to the legacy established by the Brown  decision. I would also like to thank and  commend the work of the Brown v.  Board of Education 50th Anniversary  Commission. Finally I would like to  recognize all of the cases that comprise  the Brown decision.  BELTONV. GEBHART (BULAHV. GIBHART)—  DELAWARE  First petitioned  in  1951,  the  local  cases, Belton v. Gebhart and Bulah v.  Gibhart, challenged the inferior conditions of two African American schools.  In the suburb of Claymont, DE, African  American  children  were  prohibited  from attending the area’s local high  school.  In  the  rural  community of  Hockessin, Delaware, African American students were forced to attend a  dilapidated one-room schoolhouse and  were not provided transportation to  the school, while white children in the  area were provided transportation and  a better  school  facility. Both cases  were represented by a local NAACP attorney. Though  the State Supreme  Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs,  the  decision  did  not  apply  to  all  schools in Delaware.  BOLLING, ET. AL. V. C.

877,171,2004-05-06,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, Jerusalem Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio will bid a fond farewell to its revered patriarch, Reverend Harry  Crenshaw. With  the coming of spring, Reverend Crenshaw  retires  as  pastor  of  the  church after a lifetime of service to his flock  and that of the larger Toledo community. Truly  a community leader, long recognized as the  voice of the church, Reverend Crenshaw has  been a mainstay of the Jerusalem congregation and its neighborhood for decades. He is  a man for others.  ‘Blessed is the may that walks not in the  counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way  of sinners, nor sits at the seat of the scornful.  But his delight is in the Law of the Lord; and  in His  law does he meditate both day and  night. And he shall be like a tree planted by  the rivers of  the water,  that brings  forth his  fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.’ (Psalms, 1:1– 3)  Within the words of this passage lies Reverend Dr. Harry Crenshaw. A man of God, he  lives the Word in thought and deed, and has  imparted his love of that Word to generations.  Through his strength and wisdom he has provided counsel to thousands. The esteem with  which he is held is testament to his prominent  role in the lifeblood of the community and the  personal lives of the people to whom he ministers.  While no one can build a church alone, Jerusalem Baptist Church and  its ministry,  the  Jerusalem Outreach Center, are attributable to  the passion and perseverance of Reverend  Dr. Crenshaw. His guidance and  leadership  have been a primary force in the growth of the  church and its neighborhood mission, particularly its embrace of our youth. He has come  to embody faith and hope for the next generation of our community.  Reverend Dr. Crenshaw has earned his rest  as he takes his leave from the day-to-day operations of the Jerusalem congregation. Yet,  his abiding goodness lives strong in each of  us whose lives he has touched. We know he  will  remain  involved  in  its activities  for  the  church and its works are a part of him. Reverend Dr. Harry Crenshaw’s soul will echo on  in the buildings’ walls and the congregation’s  hearts for many years to come. He came this  far by  faith with his beautiful wife, Frances,  and he led us all to a more humane and compassionate community and world.  f  THANKING OUR TEACHERS MAY 2–  8—TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 6, 2004  ",2004
878,171,2004-05-06,Mr. DAVIS of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, Albert  Einstein once said that ‘ It is the supreme art  of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge’ . I rise today to thank  our Nation’s  teachers  for  their exceptional  work, compassion and dedication to our children everyday. Although May 4th was National  Teacher’s Day, this entire week, May 2– 8 is  Teacher Appreciation Week.  I think everyone can think back and remember that one teacher that touched their lives— whether  it was  the one  that  taught you  to  read, gave you the confidence to learn more,  made you  feel smart and knowledgeable or  was the one solid, caring adult in a child’s life.  The origins of Teacher Day are not too defined. Around 1944 Arkansas teacher Mattye  Whyte Woodridge began corresponding with  political and education leaders about the need  for  a  national  day  to  honor  teachers.  Woodbridge wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt who  in 1953 persuaded the 81st Congress to proclaim a National Teacher Day. It wasn’t until  March 1985, when National Education Association  (NEA) and  the National PTA established Teacher Appreciation Week as the first  full week of May with the first Tuesday remaining as National Teacher’s Day.  Teachers are  true heroes  in our communities, who through their dedication to children  work millions of small miracles every day.  Henry Brooks Adams, a historian and grandson of President John Quincy Adams once  said that ‘ ‘A teacher affects eternity; he can  never tell where his influence stops.’  We must  never  forget  to  thank our  teachers  for  their  service to our society and for creating a better,  smarter and hopefully kinder future generation.  f  HONORING JERSEY CITY HUDSON  CITY LIONS CLUB  HON.

879,171,2004-05-06,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the Jersey City Hudson City Lions  Club in celebration of its 50th anniversary. The  Jersey City Hudson City Lions Club (JCHCLC)  celebrated with a 50th Anniversary Ball held  on Saturday, May 1, 2004, at Puccini’s Restaurant in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Since 1954,  the Jersey City Hudson City  Lions Club has fulfilled the motto of the International Lions Club of ‘ ‘We Serve,’  and has  taken an active role in civic, cultural, and social events. With a membership of dedicated  men and women, the JCHCLC has provided  exceptional services for our community, promoting a better quality of life for the people it  touches.  Working with local churches, hospitals, clinics,  summer programs,  shelters, and  food  banks, the Jersey City Hudson City Lions Club  has given all  its support  in gathering necessary supplies and  food  to help  those  in  need, taking tremendous pride in the positive  difference it makes in the lives of the people  in its community and around the world.  Jersey City Hudson City Lions Club is renowned for its sight-related programs. Working  with St. Joseph’s Home of  the Blind,  the  JCHCLC  has  provided  services,  including  guide dogs, walking canes, vocational training,  summer  camps,  books  on  tape,  spring  barbeques and Christmas parties. They also  provide vouchers for Lenscrafter, so that children, who would otherwise have no access,  can purchase eyeglasses.  At the 50th Anniversary Ball, the Jersey City  Hudson City  Lions Club  honored  former  JCHCLC President Frank Walsh (1973– 1974),  who was presented with the ‘ ‘Lion of the Year  Award ’ for his outstanding  leadership and  dedicated  service  over  the  years  to  the  JCHCLC.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the members and officers, past and  present, of the Jersey City Hudson City Lions  Club  in recognition of  their outstanding contributions and caring dedication to our community over the last 50 years.  ‘ ’   ‘ ’   ’ ’ ’   ",2004
880,178,2004-05-06,Mr. DAVIS of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of H. Con. Res. 380, to acknowledge the great benefits and the importance of music in our Nation’s schools.  We  know music education helps  young  minds to develop creativity and expression of  emotions. Studies show that early music training can enhance a child’s ability to reason and  think critically, that children exposed to music  at a young age learn better in other subjects,  and that children trained in music score significantly higher on reading tests than those who  were not. Unfortunately,  these programs are  being cut from more and more schools with  the majority  of  students  attending  public  schools in inner city neighborhoods having virtually no access  to music education, which  places them at a disadvantage compared to  their peers in other communities.  Although studies show the great outcomes  of having music education, local budget cuts  are depriving approximately 30,000,000 students of an education that includes music. It is  not only at  the  local  level  that  is  forcing  schools to abandon music education but the  lack of federal funding as well. As our schools  struggle to meet No Child Left Behind guidelines without full funding, provide education to  all  students without  full  funding  for  IDEA,  schools are faced with making the decisions to  cut music, art, after school activities or being  labeled a failing school. We need to not only  recognize  the  benefits  and  importance  of  music education, but embrace  it, realize  the  need for it and other art education programs  in all of our nation’s schools and most importantly save music education  from becoming  extinct. Without music education so many of  our great musicians  that we admire  today— would be doing something else. But the school  music program was  there  for  them and we  need to have it there for the next generation  of musicians.  f  COMMENDING DAVID LEESON AND  CHERYL DIAZ MEYER OF DALLAS  MORNING  NEWS  STAFF,  WINNERS  OF  2004  PULITZER  PRIZE  FOR  BREAKING  NEWS  PHOTOGRAPH  HON.

881,178,2004-05-06,Ms.  EDDIE  BERNICE  JOHNSON.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise to congratulate two great journalists, David Leeson and Cheryl Diaz Meyer  of Dallas Morning News, who were recently  awarded the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking  News Photography.  We Texans saw blood spill, tears shed and  conflict unfold in the trenches of Iraq through  their camera lens.  Mr. Leeson, who was with the U.S. Army’s  Third Infantry Division for six weeks, captured  an image of an Iraqi rolling out of a vehicle  engulfed  in  flames, only  to be shot by an  American soldier; Ms. Meyer photographed a  gripping scene of American troops risking their  lives to save a wounded civilian.  The Pulitzer is Leeson’s first. He had been  a Pulitzer finalist three other times. The Iraq  war is the 11th major conflict Leeson has covered. He has also produced work on  the  apartheid in South Africa, a portion of the Gulf  War and flooding in Southeast Texas.  It was the first Pulitzer for Ms. Meyer also,  a News photographer  since 2000.  In  late  2001, she  traveled  to Afghanistan  to photograph the war on terrorism and its effects to  topple the oppressive Taliban regime. She has  received numerous awards  for her body of  work  there  including  the John Faber Award  from the Overseas Press Club. In April 2002,  Ms. Meyer traveled to the Philippines and Indonesia where she photographed Muslim and  Christian extremism and the violence caused  by religious hatred.  Mr. Speaker, I also congratulate the Dallas  Morning News’ entire staff  for  their seventh  Pulitzer.  Mr. Leeson and Ms. Meyer, I commend you  for this great accomplishment. Keep capturing  those shots because they are worth a thousand words.  f  IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN ARTHUR  L. FELDER  HON. MIKE ROSS  OFARKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 6, 2004  ",2004
882,178,2004-05-06,Mr. ROSS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor Captain Arthur L. Felder of Lewisville,  AR, who died on April 24, 2004, fighting for  his country in Taji, Iraq. Arthur ‘ ‘Bo’  Felder,  just 36 years old, was one of  four soldiers  killed during an attack on the base camp of  the Arkansas’s 39th Infantry Brigade. I wish to  recognize his life and achievements.  Bo spent nearly  two decades serving  the  Army and National Guard. During that time, he  served  in peacekeeping missions  in Bosnia  and Honduras. While not serving our country,  children were Bo’s passion, and he spent  much of life involved with youth. He worked at  Step One Alternative school in Little Rock, a  school for kids with legal troubles, and served  as a youth director at St. Luke Missionary  Baptist Church in North Little Rock.  I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of  soldiers  from Arkansas’s 39th Brigade, who  died while supporting Operation  Iraqi Freedom. These brave Americans lost their lives  while making  the ultimate sacrifice  to serve  our country, and I will be forever grateful to  them for their courageous spirit.  Bo gave his life to serve our country and will  forever be remembered as a hero, a son, and  a father. My deepest condolences go out to  his son Jaelun, eight years old, his daughter  Amari, four years old, his mother, Dr. Cheryl  Stuart, his brothers, Robert Stuart and Littrelle  Felder, and  two sisters, Gwendolyn Gingery  and Kelana Greer. I know Bo was proud of his  service to the U.S. Army and to our country.  He will be missed by his  family,  fellow soldiers, and all those who knew him and counted him as a friend. I will continue to keep Bo  and his family in my thoughts and prayers.  RECOGNITION OF MR. ANDREW  JACKSON HIGGINS  HON. TOM OSBORNE  OFNEBRASKA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 6, 2004  ",2004
883,178,2004-05-06,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the accomplishments of Mr. Andrew  Jackson Higgins whom President Eisenhower  once said is ‘ ‘The man who won the war for  us’ , referring to his development and production of Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats that landed  on the shores of many beaches during World  War II.  Andrew Jackson Higgins was born on August 28, 1886,  in Columbus, Nebraska,  to  John Gonigle and Anna Long (O’Conner) Higgins. His innovative mind showed itself at an  early age, and by 12 years old, he was motivated to build his first craft in the basement of  his home. The shallow water boats that floated  along the Loup and Platte Rivers during his  childhood inspired him.  His passion  for boats did not stop  in his  childhood; Mr. Higgins organized Higgins Industries,  Inc.  in 1930,  to build boats  for his  lumber business. He began designing boats  because of navigation problems he encountered involving the moving of logs in shallow  waterways. The structure of  these shallow  boats eventually led to the development of the  PT boats and their capability to travel in shallow water.  He also created PT boats, which were also  known as Higgins Boats. Higgins Boats, constructed of wood and steel, transported fully-  armed  troops,  light  tanks,  field artillery, and  other mechanized equipment essential to Allied versatile operations including the decisive  D-Day attack at Normandy, France. He continued  to design boats and eventually engineered  over  20,000,  including  rocket-firing  landing craft support boats, high-speed boats  and various types of military landing craft.  Following  the D-Day attack,  thousands of  lesser-known  assaults  employed  Higgins  Boats, which included landing on the beaches  of Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Okinawa,  Leyte, and Guam. Mr. Higgins not only specialized in landing craft such as PT boats, but  also constructed freight supply ships and airborne lifeboats that could be dropped from B– 17 Bombers.  The production of Higgins Boats enabled  Mr. Higgins to establish four major assembly  plants in New Orleans for mass construction  of landing craft and other vessels vital to the  Allied forces’ conduct of World War II. He also  trained over 30,000 Navy, Marine, and Coast  Guard personnel on  the safe operation of  landing craft at  the Higgins’ Boat Operators  School.  Mr. Higgins had another great accomplishment during World War II that established a  progressive social policy at Higgins Industries  Inc. He employed a fully integrated assembly  workforce of black and white men and women.  His policy was equal pay for equal work, decades before integration and racial and gender  equality became the law of our land.  In 1964, the former President Dwight D. Eisenhower said of Andrew Jackson Higgins,  ‘He is the man who won the war for us. If Mr.  Higgins had not developed and produced  those landing craft, we never could have gone  in over an open beach. We would have had to  change the entire strategy of the war.’   ’ ’   ‘ ’   ",2004

I ask that my colleagues pay tribute to this  English  teacher  from West Scranton High  School as he receives  this  tremendous recognition  from  the Milken Foundation during  Teacher Appreciation Week.  Teachers are our nation’s unsung heroes.  The number of young lives touched by teachers is countless, and Mr. Mazzino exemplifies  the best in his profession by encouraging his  students to achieve far beyond the reach of  what they thought possible. Mr. Mazzino’s creative writing class published a book entitled  ‘26 Odd: Creative Works by Creative Writers.’ In addition, Mr. Mazzino diligently works  with students throughout the entire school to  help increase their scores on Pennsylvania’s  state accountability  test. As a  result of Mr.  Mazzino’s  efforts,  West  Scranton  High  School’s reading and writing test scores have  improved significantly.  Mr. Mazzino also demonstrated his dedication by revamping the entire summer reading  program at the West Scranton. I am proud to  recognize the fact that Mr. Mazzino is the 37th  teacher from our state to receive this award.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege  to represent a teacher who has dedicated his  life to today’s young people, who will indeed  have  a  brighter  future  because  of Mr.  Mazzino.  f  RECOGNITION OF GARY WESTON  HON.

SHEILA JACKSON-LEE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 5, 2004  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in strong support of this resolution that  will  raise awareness of autism, one of  the  most mysterious, and challenging mental conditions that affects the American people. Autism affects 1  in 166 children  today, and  is  thus  the  third most common developmental  disability. Autism comes in a wide spectrum of  intensities,  ranging  from mild  personality  quirks, to profound communication difficulties,  to self-destructive behaviors, to utter dependence on care-givers.  This nation spends $90 million per year caring  for people with autism. The Centers  for  Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that as many as 1.5 million Americans  have some form of autism, and the prevalence  is skyrocketing. Based on statistics from the  U.S. Department of Education and other government agencies, autism is growing at a rate  of 10 – 17 percent per year. At these rates, the  prevalence of autism  in our country alone  could reach 4 million in the next decade.  The cost of specialized treatment in a developmental center for people with autism is approximately $80,000 per  individual per year.  The cost of special education programs  for  school-aged children with autism is often more  than $30,000 per individual per year. But the  greatest burden of caring for the autistic falls  on families of those with autism.  It is hard to even imagine what it would be  like to be autistic or to care for an autistic family member. To give a bit of insight, I would  like to share a personal story of one of my  staff members, who has a 26-year-old autistic  daughter named ‘ ‘Amy.’  Despite the fact that  Amy is an adult, she is not able to use language to communicate her needs. She cannot  communicate even simple messages such as  that she has a stomach ache or that her room  is  too cold, and she gets extremely upset  when she needs to communicate and is not  able to do it.  This staffer shared a story  that he said  would probably sound familiar to any person  who has  lived with autistic  individuals. Amy  woke my staffer and his wife in the middle of  the night one night with screams of rage and  frustration. When  they rushed  into her bedroom, she took them to her bedroom window  ‘ ’   ’ ",2004
887,2,2004-05-14,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to address a growing problem in  my home State of Hawaii and the Nation,  individuals  that  do not have  health insurance. The total number of  uninsured people in the United States  reached 43.6 million in 2002. Since 2000,  the total number of uninsured has increased by 3.8 million. In the State of  Hawaii, it is estimated that there are  approximately 120,000 people who do  not have health insurance.  The uninsured delay seeking medical  treatment, which is likely to lead to  more significant and more costly problems later on than if they had sought  earlier,  preventative  treatment  or  proper disease management. Health insurance  is essential to making sure  that individuals can access health care  services and properly manage  their  chronic diseases, such as diabetes. A  tremendous amount of needless pain  and suffering can be eliminated by ensuring that health insurance is universally available.  Everyone should have access to affordable health insurance. We must expand Medicaid and the State Children’s  Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, to  provide essential access to health care  for more people. In addition, we must  take steps to help rein in health care  costs in an attempt to keep coverage  affordable. Providing  additional  resources for disease management programs and primary health care services  will lead to long-term savings and benefits. Also, meaningful  prescription  drug patent  law reforms need to be  made to ensure that generic drugs can  be brought to market in a timely manner.  We are also obligated to help provide  support to health care providers that  provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. In Hawaii, it is estimated that  hospitals lost $95 million for uncompensated care in 2002. However, while  other states benefit from Medicaid disproportionate  share  hospital, DSH,  payments designed  to provide additional support to hospitals that treat  large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients, Hawaii is left out of  this important program.  The Balanced Budget Act of  1997,  BBA, created specific DSH allotments  for each state based on each of their  actual DSH expenditures for fiscal year  1995. In 1994, the State of Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the  number of uninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid  DSH program was  incorporated  into  QUEST. As a result of the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have DSH  expenditures in 1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP  Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act of 2000 made further changes to the  DSH program, which included the establishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, States without allotments were again left out. Other States  that have obtained waivers similar to  Hawaii’s have retained their DSH allotments. Only two States, Hawaii and  Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments.  I was disappointed that  language similar to an amendment that I  had offered, which was accepted as part  of the manager’s package for the Senate’s prescription drug bill was not included in the conference report for H.R.  1, the Medicare Prescription Drug and  Modernization Act of 2003. The  language that was finally included prevents Hawaii from obtaining its DSH  allotment as long as the QUEST program remains in place.  Medicaid DSH funding is needed because  our  hospitals  in Hawaii  are  struggling to meet the elevated demands placed upon them by the  increasing number of uninsured people.  DSH payments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the rising health care needs  of our communities and reinforce our  health care safety net. All 50 States  need to have access to Medicaid DSH  support.  While Hawaii continues to be denied  this assistance, many States  fail to  fully utilize their DSH allotments. For  fiscal year 1999, more than $1.2 billion  was returned to the Treasury because  States failed to draw down their full  Medicaid DSH allotments. More than  $800 million was returned to the Treasury for fiscal year 2000. It is unfair that  while certain States are declining to  use their full allocation, States with no  or small allotments are being denied  the use of these resources. A viable option to provide relief for Hawaii and  other low-DSH States is to redistribute  funding  that other States have  returned to the Treasury. It is not fair  that States that either lack any DSH  funding or have  low-DSH allotments  cannot have an opportunity to apply  for these excess funds to help bolster  their public health safety net.  I appreciate all of the work done by  my colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, to help provide relief  to low-DSH States. I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues  to help  restore Medicaid DSH payments to Hawaii. Also, we must continue our efforts to improve access to  health care so that everyone can obtain  affordable,  comprehensive,  and  quality health care coverage.

889,2,2004-05-14,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, this  week our country observes National  Police Week, a time to honor the men  and women who put their lives on the  line every day  to bring peace—and  peace of mind—to America’s  cities,  towns, and neighborhoods.  Tomorrw, Police Week culminates in  Peace Officers Memorial Day, when we  pay special honor to those officers who  gave their lives in he line of duty.  This memorial has a long history. In  1789, a U.S. Marshal named Robert  Forsyth was shot and killed in the line  of duty.  Since then, over 14,000 law enforcement officers have given their lives to  protect the liberties upon which America was founded.  Police officers have always served as  the first line of protection for our communities. But 3 years ago, on September 11, our Nation gained a new appreciation both for the dangers they  face and for the courage they routinely  exhibit.  We owe our police officers a debt of  gratitude  that  is  immeasurable and  unending.  Every year we honor those that lost  their lives in the line of duty and carve  their names into the Police Memorial  so that future generations will know  who they are, and that they lived, and  died, as heroes.  This year, one of South Dakota’s heroes will be honored and remembered.  Deputy Bill Davis joined the Moody  County Sheriff’s Office in 1982, where  he served as deputy sheriff for 21 years.  Like so many of our officers, Deputy  Davis’s service to his community was  bigger than his badge.  Bill Davis was a veteran of the U.S.  Navy and the National Guard.  He embodied the values of community service and civic duty throughout  his life. Last November, while investigating a car accident, Deputy Davis  was struck by a car and killed.  As we commemorate the heroism of  Deputy Bill Davis, and all those who  lost their lives in the line of duty, we  cannot help but acknowledge the risks  undertaken  each and  every day by  America’s police officers.  Our police officers do not ask for reward or recognition, merely the tools  they need to do their job. And in return  for all they have given us, we have an  obligation to ensure they have every  available resource necessary to keep  our neighborhoods safe.  Over the past year, I have spent a lot  of time meeting with South Dakota’s  police officers, asking about the specific challenges they face, and what we  can do here in the Senate to support  them.  The most pressing issue for our Nation’s law enforcement is the added responsibility and burden of being first  responders in the event of terrorist attack. The complexity of this new role  requires  training and  tools  that no  small local police department could be  expected to have on its own.

895,9,2004-05-14,Mr. DAYTON.," Mr. President,  this  week brought the disturbing news that  the Senate, the House, and the White  House might not be able to agree on a  new transportation funding bill, that  we would have to set it aside then until  next year to be acted upon. That would  be disastrous  for my home State of  Minnesota, and I suspect for many of  the States my colleagues represent.  Traffic congestion in our main metropolitan areas in Minnesota has worsened at alarming rates during the past  decade. The deterioration of our roads,  highways,  and  bridges  throughout  greater Minnesota, more rural areas of  our State, has also reached crisis levels. More and more of our highways  have become unsafe due to this deterioration and congestion.  More motorists are dying, being injured or maimed as a result. Business  owners and  farmers  find that transporting their goods and products to  market takes longer and is more costly. Some  of  the  seasonal  national  weight  restrictions  force major employers such as Polaris, Artic Cat, and  Marvin Windows, which are located in  northwestern Minnesota, to have to reroute their trucks, adding time, expense, and unreliability that become  major drawbacks to operating a business in Minnesota.  Businesses executives, their employees and their families, have to take  longer  to drive  to and  from work,  school, and weekend cabins, and they  are less safe in doing so. Every day and  night, many thousands of Minnesotans  endure these delays and disruptions.

896,16,2004-05-14,Mr. SANDLIN.," Mr. Speaker, with nearly 44  million Americans  lacking basic health care  coverage, it is time to take action. Health care  is a basic necessity—not a  luxury—for all  Americans.  The House Republicans claim  to be concerned about the uninsured, but actions speak  louder  than words. Consider what  they’ve  passed this year. Their budget resolution decimates Medicaid  and  the State Children’s  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Republican budget requires a $2.2 billion cut in  Medicaid funding, which will compromise the  well-being of over 500 million children,  their  parents, seniors, and disabled individuals. This  comes at a time when States are already in  fiscal crisis, resulting in nearly every State cutting their own Medicaid program by slashing  eligibility, cutting benefits, raising co-payments  and reducing provider payments.  Republicans have also tried to allow $1 billion in SCHIP funding to expire on September  30, despite the critical need to provide health  care coverage to needy children. Earlier Federal and State cuts  to Medicaid and SCHIP  have already caused irreparable harm to families in Texas. Since SCHIP cuts in Texas took  effect last September 1, 2003, enrollment for  kids has dropped from over 507,000 children  to  377,051.  For  those  children  fortunate  enough to retain some health coverage, they  have had to endure the loss of all dental, vision, and hospice benefits.  How  is  this acceptable? How can we  tolerate cuts that will compound this problem?  Mr. Speaker,  it  is a commonly held misconception  that people without health  insurance are people who don’t work. Nationwide,  more than eight in ten of the nearly 44 million  uninsured persons  in 2003  lived  in  families  where the head of the family worked. In fact,  in most States today, a significant portion of  the workforce is without insurance.  Too many hard-working,  tax-paying American  lack even  the most basic health  insurance coverage. It is time to move beyond the  rhetoric and take action.  My home State of Texas actually leads the  nation with 27 percent of our employed or self-  employed workers without health  insurance.  This can be partially attributed to the fact that  many of those uninsured are working in small  businesses. In 2000 more than 17 percent of  the  labor  force  in Texas worked  for businesses with 20 or fewer employees. The prohibitive expense of health insurance is a barrier  to most small employers offering health  coverage. The United States Chamber  of  Commerce  recently estimated  that  it costs  small businesses approximately $9,000 a year  to provide health  insurance  for each employee.  Mr. Speaker, join with 87 of my colleagues  today  in offering  legislation  that will provide  immediate, concrete relief by introducing the  Small Business Health  Insurance Promotion  Act today. This legislation will help secure affordable coverage for millions of self-insured  individuals  and  employees  of  small  businesses.  As an  incentive  to provide coverage,  the  Small Business Health  Insurance Promotion  Act would make small businesses or self-employed individuals eligible to receive a 50 percent tax credit for four years to defray the cost  of health  insurance. The bill would also authorize  funding  to create state and national  multi-insurer pools to provide comprehensive  and affordable health  insurance choices  to  small employers and the self-employed.  To receive the tax credit, participating employers must offer all of their employees coverage through either the qualified state or national  health  insurance  pools. These  purchasing pools would ensure comprehensive  and affordable health  insurance. Participants  would receive a choice of plans virtually identical  to  those available  to Members of Congress and other Federal employees.  I also join my fellow democratic colleagues  today in introducing the FamilyCare Act and  the Medicare Early Access Act. The  former  builds upon  the Medicaid and SCHIP programs by providing new  funding  to  cover  working parents. This legislation is expected to  cover over 7.5 million low-income parents as  well as  improve coverage of children. The  Medicare Early Access Act addresses the serious problem faced by the many retirees who  lose or do not have health coverage in retirement but are not yet eligible for Medicare. This  legislation will allow uninsured people between  the ages of 55 and 64 to purchase Medicare.  Enrollees will be given a 75 percent refundable, advanceable tax credit which will make it  affordable. This legislation could result in coverage of 3.5 million previously uninsured people.  There are grave consequences for families  without health insurance. People without coverage are less likely to get important preventive care and therefore are concomitantly more  likely to suffer from serious health complications as problems go untreated. It also harms  our economy. Sick people are not productive  people. It makes sense to fortify the health of  our nation.  The Small Business Health Insurance Promotion Act, FamilyCare Act and Medicare  Early Access Act that we are introducing today  offer real solutions to real problems. Together  these initiatives could provide health coverage  to more than 1⁄2of the 44 million uninsured  Americans. They represent a great step in the  right direction that I am proud to be a part of.  SUPPORTING  THE  GOALS  AND  IDEALS OF PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY  SPEECHOF  HON. DONNA M. CHRISTENSEN  OFTHEVIRGINISLANDS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 11, 2004  ",2004
897,16,2004-05-14,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H. Res. 622, supporting the goals  and  ideals of Peace Officers Memorial Day  and urge my colleagues to support its adoption.  Pursuant to a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, Congress authorized and requested the President to designate May 15 of  each year as ‘‘Peace Officers Memorial Day’’  and  the week  in which  it  falls as  ‘‘Police  Week.’’  In this regard, I applaud my colleagues JOEL  HEFLEY, TOMDAVIS, HENRYWAXMANand BART  STUPAK, a  former Peace Officer himself,  for  sponsoring H. Res. 622 to further encourage  the observance of a day of remembrance for  the more than, 1600 Federal, State, and local  peace officers who were killed or disabled in  the line of duty in past 10 years.  Mr. Speaker, Police Memorial Day 2004 will  be a particularly sad one for my constituents  in the Virgin Islands and me because of the  passing  of Virgin Police Officer Cuthbert  Chapman who was shot several times on April  17 as he tried to stop a robbery.  Officer Chapman, also known as ‘‘Chappy,’’  ‘‘Kimba’’ and ‘‘Cutty,’’ was remembered as a  soft-spoken and kind-hearted friend who was  always willing to give a helping hand. He was  a 12-year veteran on the force. He joined the  police department on June 15, 1992, and was  assigned to the Bicycle Patrol Unit at Wilbur  Francis Command in Frederiksted. Chapman  also served  in various units and bureaus  in  the department.  As we remember and pay tribute to Officer  Chapman, I must also mention and recognize  some of  the other Peace Officers,  including  Randy  Stevens,  Steven  Hodge,  Richard  Callwood,  Dexter  Mardenborough, Wilbur  Francis, Allen William, and Patrick Sweeney,  who lost their lives striving to keep the streets  and communities of the Virgin Islands safe.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is  fitting  that we acknowledge and commend the courage and dedication shown by all Peace Officers who have  given their lives for their fellow citizens. I urge  my colleagues to support this resolution.  f  FEDERAL FUNDING FOR POLICE  OFFICERS  HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 12, 2004  ",2004

Frank has brought  an outstanding level of energy and integrity to  the Colorado General Assembly  throughout  his years of public service, and as he celebrates his retirement, let it be known that he  leaves behind a great legacy of commitment  to the people of Colorado.  Representing the people of Arapahoe County in District 36, Frank was elected in 2000  based on his fair and balanced approach to  government and his previous political experience. In 1977, he was appointed to the Aurora  Parks and Recreation Board; in 1979, he was  named  to  the Aurora Planning and Zoning  Commission; and from 1981 to 1994 served  on  the Aurora City Council.  In 1994, he received an appointment  to  the State Senate  and was subsequently reelected in 1996, before running for the State House of Representatives in 2000. During his tenure in the General Assembly Frank has worked hard to improve education and promote fiscal responsibility. During his last term, he sat on the Local  Government Committee and  the State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee.  Mr. Speaker,  I am honored  to pay  tribute  before this body of Congress and this nation  to State Representative Frank Weddig for his  selfless efforts of public service during his tenure  in  the Colorado General Assembly. The  level of integrity and honesty he has displayed  while serving his district and  the people of  Colorado has earned the respect and admiration of his peers. I would like to extend my  congratulations to Frank on his retirement and  wish him and his wife Pat all the best in their  future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO COL. CELIA Y.  BRAMBLE  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 13, 2004  ",2004
900,23,2004-05-14,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of  Col. Celia Y. Bramble  in  recognition of her  dedication to the work of Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn.  Celia Y. Bramble is currently an Associate  Executive Director for Training and Organizational Development at Kings County Hospital  Center. She began her career at Kings County  Hospital in 1967 after migrating from St. Vincent and the Grenadines. She moved up the  ranks from Staff Nurse and Head Nurse to administrative  positions  through  academic  achievement, clinical competence and dedication.  In her current role, Celia has overall responsibility  for planning, coordinating and developing educational programs  for professional  and support staff within the Central Brooklyn  Family Health Network. This  includes overseeing over 40 training initiatives managed by  Community Health Partnership funds. One of  her greatest rewards is to see support staff,  who she has coached and mentored, become  practical and  registered nurses. One of her  major achievements is the 100 percent success rate that she has had in preparing students to take the New York State Board for  Nursing examination.  Ms. Bramble is also responsible for coordinating clinical experience  for students  in 14  programs of nursing. She serves on the advisory board of 7 of these programs. In her role  as board member, she provides guidance to  faculty  to  include  the need  for  curriculum  changes to support current trends in nursing,  so that new graduates can successfully make  the  transition  from  student  to  practitioner.  Some of her recommendations resulted in programs of nursing adding Cultural Diversity,  Pain Management and Introduction to Nursing  Management to the curriculum.  Ms. Bramble  received her undergraduate  degree  from CW Post College, Long  Island  University; a Master of Arts  in Teaching  in  Nursing and a Masters in Education from Columbia University. She also holds a Certification in Nursing Education and Staff Development  from  the  American  Nurses  Credentialing Center. Among her professional  awards are the New York State Nurses Association Nursing Education Award  and  the  Health and Hospitals Corporation Multicultural  Award for developing programs to promote tolerance for a culturally diverse workforce.  Ms. Bramble’s accomplishments extend far  beyond her professional affiliations.  In 1981,  she was commissioned as a Captain  in  the  United States Army Reserve. Over the years,  her devotion to duty, clinical skills and leadership qualities elevated her to the rank of Colonel. Her distinguished military career included  assignments  in various military hospitals  in  peacetime and wartime. Her last assignment  was Commander of the 344th Combat Support  Hospital at Fort Hamilton, New York, until she  retired as a Colonel in April 2003. Her military  honors include: The Legion of Merit award, the  Army Commendation Medal with Four Oak  Leaf Clusters,  the Army Achievement Medal  with Two Oak Leaf Clusters, numerous Certificates of Achievement and Letters of Commendation.  Mr. Speaker, Col. Celia Bramble has dedicated her life to providing quality healthcare to  both civilians and military personnel. As such,  she is more than worthy of receiving our recognition  today and  I urge my colleagues  to  join me in honoring this truly remarkable person.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. JOHN R.

904,30,2004-05-14,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today in honor of Mr. William B. Schatz, General Counsel of the Northeast Ohio Regional  Sewer District (NEORSD), in Cleveland, Ohio.  Mr. Schatz serves as the district’s representative to the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies (AMSA). On May 24, 2004, the  members of AMSA elected Mr. Schatz to be  the president of  the Association stemming  from his exemplary commitment and dedication to a clean-water community.

In May of 2004, AMSA  celebrated 34 years of service to the clean-  water community and the nation.  Mr. Schatz has served with distinction at  NEORSD  from 1979 and  for over 20 years  has been a leader in the water quality arena  working on many projects on behalf of the district and AMSA.

Over  his thirty-seven year career, John helped preserve the beauty of the national forests in Colorado and other Western states, while making  them more accessible for the public to enjoy.  His service to this nation is commendable and  worthy of recognition by this body of Congress  and this nation.  John graduated from California Polytechnic  State University with a degree  in environmental design while working  for  the Forest  Service  in  the Angeles National Forest. Following his graduation, he worked in National  Forests in California, Nevada, and Idaho focusing on the planning of recreational areas.

908,37,2004-05-14,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  take  this means  to recognize Concerns of Police  Survivors,  Inc. The organization, which provides support and encouragement to families  of  law enforcement officers who have given  their  lives, observes  its 20th anniversary on  May 14. The organization, also known as  COPS, has grown  into an  international non-  profit organization comprised of 13,000 families in the United States, with an affiliate in the  United Kingdom.  The genesis of COPS occurred  in 1983,  when ten survivors of fallen officers gathered  to talk about the difficulties they faced when  their  loved ones were killed. Within a year  they decided there was a need for a support  organization that could understand the trauma  inflicted on surviving  families and agencies  when an officer was killed in the line of duty.  COPS was officially organized on May 14,  1984, with 110 police survivors attending the  first National Police Survivors’ Conference in  Washington, DC.  It organized  independently  from other police organizations  in order  to  allow members to reach out to any survivor regardless of their loved one’s police organization affiliation.  COPS sponsors weekend retreats  for surviving spouses, parents, adult children, siblings, and in-laws. The organization also hosts  a week-long summer camp and a weekend  wilderness experience in the Colorado Rockies  for surviving children. With  funding  from  the Department of Justice, COPS presents  training that teaches officers how to help surviving families, affected co-workers, and communities deal with the tragedy of line-of-duty  deaths.  Mr. Speaker, COPS is providing an important service to those families and coworkers of  officers who have lost their lives. From humble  beginnings  in a basement office  to a brand  new  facility  in Camdenton, Missouri, COPS  has brought healing and support to those who  have lost a friend or loved one. I know my fellow Members will  join with me  in  thanking  members of  this organization  for  their work  and dedication.  f  FREEDOM FOR NELSON MOLINE´  ESPINO  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 13, 2004  Mr. DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker,  to speak about Nelson Moline´  I  rise  today  Espino, a prisoner of conscience in totalitarian  Cuba.  Mr. Moline´Espino is a pro-democracy activist working for freedom for the people of Cuba.  He  is  the President of  the Confederation of  Democratic Workers of Cuba and a member  of the 30 November party. Mr. Moline´Espino  has dedicated his energy and talents to liberating the oppressed people of Cuba from the  tyrannical regime.  As a leader in the struggle for freedom and  human  rights  for  the people of Cuba, Mr.  Moline´Espino has been a constant target for  the dictator’s  thugs. According  to Amnesty  International, he has been harassed for his activities, called into a police station, and threatened with arrest  if he did not abandon his  struggle for human rights and workers rights.  Because of his belief in freedom, Mr. Moline´  Espino was arrested as part of the tyrant’s vicious crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy  activists in March 2003. On March 20, he was  detained and his home was searched. Eventually Mr. Moline´ Espino was  ‘‘indicted’’ on  charges that he had mixed with people dedicated  to  ‘‘subversive’’ activity. After a sham  trial, he was sentenced to 20 years in the totalitarian gulag.  Mr. Moline´Espino is languishing in the inhuman squalor of Castro’s totalitarian gulag. According to reports, since his trial in April 2003,  he has again been ‘‘tried and sentenced’’ to  an additional year on charges of ‘‘disrespect’’.  Let us be clear, Mr. Moline´Espino is locked  in the grotesque inferno of totalitarian repression simply because he believes in democracy  and human rights.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is  unconscionable  that  peaceful pro-democracy activists are locked in  a diabolical gulag 90 miles from our shore. My  Colleagues, we must demand the immediate  release of Nelson Moline´ Espino and every  prisoner of conscience in totalitarian Cuba.  f  RECOGNIZING ‘‘COVER THE  UNINSURED WEEK’’  HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 13, 2004  ",2004
909,37,2004-05-14,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize May 10–16 as ‘‘Cover the  Uninsured Week.’’ This is an important opportunity to put the spotlight on those individuals  without access to coverage as well as those  with  inadequate coverage. Over 44 million  people—15%  of  the U.S.  population—lack  health  insurance coverage of any kind over  the entire year. It has been said many times,  but  it must be said yet again—the United  States is the only industrialized nation which  fails  to provide universal health care  to  its  people.  I hope  the  ‘‘Cover  the Uninsured  Week’’ will not just stimulate discussion, but  action, so  that soon  that statement will no  longer be true.  Individuals without  health  insurance  are  more  likely  than  insured Americans  to postpone health care, not getting  the care  they  need and not  filling prescriptions. Access  to  health insurance also has a major impact on  the  financial well-being of  families—over a  third of the uninsured had a serious problem  paying medical bills in the past year and nearly a quarter was contacted by a collection  agency. The alarming  fact  is  that  this disturbing  trend  is only worsening. Throughout  most of the 1990s, the number of uninsured  has been steadily increasing by about 1 million people every year. This problem persists  despite  the  fact  that a recent Kaiser Family  Foundation poll  found  that 78 percent of all  Americans believe that the government has a  responsibility to expand health insurance coverage to more Americans. This strong sense  of national support for expanding health care  to the uninsured is a mandate to the government to act now on this urgent problem that is  profoundly affecting the ability of Americans to  live healthy and productive lives.  The lack of affordable health care and the  national epidemic of  the uninsured  is not a  problem with a single face. The uninsured are  a diverse group of people—they are young  professionals, small business owners, laborers  and service employees. They are children,  parents, and  the near elderly. Any working  person in this country can end up being uninsured at some point  in  their  life. Today,  I  would  like  to  look beyond  the numbers and  present before you snapshots of two people  from my state of Illinois who are living without  insurance.  Jocelyn Graf of Oak Park,  Illinois had  to  give up her health insurance when she started  her own small English language training business and discovered that she could not afford  the insurance plans available on the market.  Jocelyn has received discounted medical care  with assistance from the Campaign for Better  Health Care. Jocelyn explained that she has  been willing to risk living without insurance because she is young and healthy, but the lack  of coverage would have been harder to deal  with if she had ongoing health needs or was  injured.

910,44,2004-05-14,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize Dr. Lee L. Huntsman, who will  soon complete his  term as president of  the  University of Washington. I want to acknowledge his service to the State of Washington,  to the students, faculty and staff of the University, and to the Nation.  Research universities like the University of  Washington are essential  to  the economic,  cultural and educational vitality of the United  States. The University of Washington  is unquestionably one of  the great research and  educational  institutions  in  this country. The  University of Washington plays a key role in  carrying out the scientific and research agenda set by Congress. Over the last 8 years Dr.  Huntsman has provided key leadership as provost and president, helping the UW establish  itself as one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial universities in America.  Dr. Huntsman  took  the helm of  this great  educational enterprise and helped to move it  forward. His  integrity,  intellect and  incisive  thinking have given  the Regents an opportunity to continue their work and have enlightened and  inspired  the efforts of  the entire  community of  the University of Washington.  We are grateful to Dr. Huntsman for answering the call to public service and for doing so  in such a principled and congenial way.  f  INTRODUCTION—WEATHER  AND  OCEANS  RESOURCES  REALIGNMENT ACT  HON. JIM SAXTON  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 13, 2004  ",2004
911,44,2004-05-14,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  be here today to introduce an important piece  of conservation  legislation,  the Weather and  Oceans Resources Realignment Act. This bill  will transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Department of the  Interior.  An issue to which I have devoted a great  deal of time and one that I feel is very important is the protection of the diverse range of  fish stocks  that  inhabit our world’s oceans,  many of which are very close to disappearing  forever. The National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency tasked with the protection of  these species has  failed  to do so.  I have  never been able to comprehend why the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA)  is housed within  the Department of  Commerce, which has nothing to do with the  protection of our natural resources. For  this  reason,  I  have  introduced  this  legislation,  which simply moves NOAA to a more appropriate agency, Interior.  Given the release of now three studies essentially stating that what I have been talking  about is likely to happen, I am more convinced  than ever that we need to take aggressive action  immediately. Many of our oceans’  fish  stocks are now  reportedly 90 percent depleted, meaning only 10 percent of the stocks  that once existed remain. And many of these  stocks are in grave danger of extinction if we  proceed down  the same path we are on  now—that is, continue to study these stocks  and do little to mitigate the damage that has  already been done.  The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, created from my Oceans Act of 2000, released  it’s report in April of this year, with many of the  same findings. We need to take immediate aggressive steps to prevent the disappearance  of  these  fish species, before  it’s  too  late.  These studies should be a wake-up call that  the process  through which our world’s  fisheries is managed is broken and needs to be  fixed.  The National Marine Fisheries Service has  demonstrated repeatedly they are incapable of  doing the job they have been tasked with as  the primary  federal agency  responsible  for  monitoring and protecting our Nation’s  fisheries. To place them within the Department of  the Interior would serve to strengthen the two  agencies goals of resources conservation.  This is an issue that resonates with anyone  who has ever been to the beach in States like  New Jersey, or watched a television program  involving the deep blue sea. And given that 50  percent of the population of the United States  lives within 100 miles of a coast,  there are  many who are personally affected by  this  issue. We have a unique opportunity  to do  something amazing and  I  think we owe  it  these wonderful resources that are our oceans  to do all we can  to bring  them back  to a  healthy and sustainable level, for future generations.  f  HONORING LULA BELL HOUSTON  HON. JOHN M. SPRATT, JR.  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 13, 2004  ",2004
912,44,2004-05-14,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to congratulate Lula Bell Houston of Davidson, North  Carolina. Ms. Houston  retired  in May 2004  from Davidson College, my alma mater, after  57 years of service in the college laundry. The  significance of this milestone in the Davidson  community  is matched only by  the devotion  that Ms. Houston has brought to her job everyday for over half a century.  Born in 1923 (just three years after the current  laundry building was constructed), Ms.  Houston worked for a year in Davidson’s dining service from 1943–44. She spent the next  few years  raising a  family, but  returned  in  1947 to work at the college laundry. She has  been there ever since, waking up every weekday morning at 4:15 a.m., to ensure that she  would be there for the 6:30 a.m. start of the  work day. Ms. Houston originally took the job  as a means of supporting herself and her two  young children after her  first husband  left  them, but  the students have kept her here  long after her children have grown up and had  kids of their own.  The biggest legacy that Ms. Houston leaves  the college and the town of Davidson is her  warm personality and loving nature. She was  always ready with a hug and a smile  to all  who came to drop off their laundry. Student  after student shared stories and memories  about Ms. Houston and all spoke of the genuine love in her voice when she greets them  and how she has been like a grandmother to  them all. The college has figured that she has  cared for the laundry of all but 1,226 of the  college’s 19,731 living alumni—a lot of surrogate grandchildren.  Davidson College honored Ms. Houston in  the best way possible, naming  the  laundry  building after her. The Town of Davidson commemorated that sunny day of April 29, 2004  by declaring  it  ‘‘Lula Bell Houston Day.’’ At  Spring Convocation the day before, the Omicron Delta Kappa honorary leadership fraternity presented Ms. Houston with its Staff Appreciation Award, and in 2002, the SAE fraternity presented Ms. Houston with $500, a  dozen roses, and a trophy recognizing her as  ‘‘The Spirit of Davidson.’’  As an article  featured on  the  college’s  ywebsite puts it, ‘‘Few retirees in local history  have been so royally heralded.’’ Ms. Houston  deserves every bit of that recognition for her  long and  tireless service  to  the college and  her part in the lives of thousands of Davidson  students over the years. I join my fellow Davidson alumni and other members of the Davidson community past and present  in commending Ms. Lula Bell Houston and celebrating her achievement.  I submit for the RECORDa news article with  more about Ms. Houston.  [From the Davidson, Apr. 30, 2004]  CAMPUSHONORSRETIREMENTOF‘‘SPIRITOF  DAVIDSON’’ INLAUNDRY’SNEWNAME  (By Leslie Hempson)  As  if  fifty-seven years of work weren’t  enough, in a sense Lula Bell Houston will  never leave her job now. That’s because the  college on Thursday afternoon affixed her  name forever to the laundry building, naming it in her honor.  Hundreds of well-wishers turned out to  honor the eighty-year-old Houston at her retirement party, and cheered when President  Robert Vagt made the surprise announcement of the building’s new name. In praising  her  loyalty to Davidson and  irrepressible  good cheer, Vagt called her  ‘‘a biological  mother to four children, but a mom to all  who needed her.’’  ‘‘This is a grand moment in the history of  Davidson College,’’ he said.  When asked to respond, Houston could find  few words.  ‘‘What can I say? What can I  say?’’ she asked. ‘‘I just want to thank everyone for being here, for letting me see your  beautiful faces. I love all of you.’’  Few retirees in local history have been so  royally heralded. In a whirlwind twenty-four  hours that capped her long career sorting  student clothes and folding sheets, President  Vagt also  read a proclamation  from  the  Town of Davidson declaring ‘‘Lula Bell Houston Day,’’ and the student membership of the  Omicron Delta Kappa honorary campus leadership fraternity presented her with its Staff  Appreciation Award at Spring Convocation.  Alumni and current students turned out at  the retirement party to honor the woman  who greeted them with a smile on their regular trips to the laundry. Joey Harris ’02,  former student body president, took a day  off his  job  in a Congressional office and  drove  from Washington  to  attend.  ‘‘I  couldn’t miss it,’’ he said. ‘‘Ms. Lula Bell has  been a good friend over the years, and we  still keep in touch. There’s no other place I’d  rather be right now than here.’’  VerDate May 04 2004  02:11 May 15, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A13MY8.100 E14PT1 ",2004
913,3,2004-05-21,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I hear  very clearly the spoken words of my  good friend and colleague. I think of  years past when Senator LEVINand I  have greatly benefited by  the  individual leadership of the Senator from  Nevada on the floor when our defense  bills have sort of gotten into a rut here  and there.  But  I encourage my distinguished  colleague from Nevada, who heard the  words of the majority leader moments  ago. Those are decisions that have to  rest with the majority and minority  leaders. Consequently, I entrust them  with those decisions. I hope that pattern of sequencing legislation on the  floor will be done in such a way as to  meet the requirements of all Senators  and proceed. I am confident it will be  done. We must, because there is no alternative but to get a bill. This Nation  is at war. The men and women of the  Armed Forces are deserving of further  recognition, which this bill has, together with their families. We send a  strong signal throughout the world of  America’s resolve in its war on terrorism—joined  by many  other  nations—and its resolve to keep our military strong.  I am hopeful the honest difference of  views can be reconciled, but  it  is a  matter that is left to the distinguished  majority leader in consultation with  the distinguished minority leader.  ",2004
914,3,2004-05-21,Mr. REID.," If I could, Mr. President, I  think the distinguished chairman of  the committee has made the argument  about why we shouldn’t get off this  bill.  I want everyone to understand the  distinguished  senior  Senator  from  South Dakota, the Democratic leader,  has had nothing to do with moving off  this bill. He wants to finish this bill.  He feels that is most appropriate.  This class action bill is important  legislation, but it pales in comparison  to the needs we authorize for these programs for our fighting men and women  around the world.  The House bill includes a number of  provisions. The $25 billion requested by  the administration, as  I understand,  also legislates the number of troops we  would have. If we don’t authorize that  along with the House, it won’t happen.  We will wind up going through the appropriations process and appropriating  money that has not been authorized in  the past.  We need this bill. I repeat, as important as the class action is, it is insignificant compared to what we are doing  here.  I  say  to everyone within  the  sound of my voice, we should do everything we can to finish this bill; otherwise, I think we will not have a Defense authorization bill this year.  ",2004
915,3,2004-05-21,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I readily acknowledge that yesterday the distinguished Senator from South Dakota  was right where I am standing until  the closing minutes of yesterday’s deliberation. He was trying to move certain matters. But I bring to the attention of the Senator that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina  had an amendment and was on the  floor. I will leave it to the record. But  other Senators said no way; we are  going to sit here through the night and  debate and debate and debate.  Therefore,  I  think  leadership—myself, Senator LEVIN, and the majority  leader—felt there was no purpose  in  trying to press on. I think we have  pretty well covered it. I think we understand our positions.  Unless the Senator has further observations——  ",2004
916,3,2004-05-21,Mr. REID.," If I could say one more  thing—and I will say no more—as I said  in my remarks this morning through  the Chair, to the distinguished Senator  from Tennessee, the majority leader,  we felt the best thing to do yesterday  was to move off the bill, and Senator  HOLLINGSand Senator CANTWELL said  when we got back we would finish this  phase of the legislation within 2 hours.  We agreed to do that.  For reasons that are in the minds of  the managers of the bill, there was a  decision not to accept it. We want to  move  forward.  I  think  the Lindsey  Graham amendment has been a hiccup  here in the process but slowed us down  all day yesterday. We think it can be  completed very quickly when we get  back.  ",2004
917,3,2004-05-21,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I wonder  if the Senator  from—the committee  chairman would yield for one minute.  I was kind of surprised when I walked  in a few minutes late on the floor to  hear we are going off this bill. I don’t  quite understand the  logic. I missed  the majority leader’s statement and I  apologize for that. But we have to pick  up this bill at some point. I don’t know  why it is assumed we are going to have  any more or less trouble when we get  back on this bill than we do right now  continuing this bill. We are going to  have to resolve the Graham issue and  we will. It can be done in a few hours.  To just set this bill aside, I am not sure  I understand what the reasoning is. It  is unusual in the middle of the Defense  bill to set it aside for some other less  important bill.  I missed  the  explanation of the majority leader. I am surprised.  We have troops in the field. There are  many important issues. The chairman  knows better than any Member in the  Senate. He is the chairman, an incredibly effective chairman of this committee, and he knows what the provisions of this bill are. They include provisions not just on all of the quality of  life  issues,  pay  issues,  and  family  issues, but they also include a very important issue on troop strength and the  signal we send on that matter. At this  moment it seems to me it is one of the  most important issues to resolve. We  are going to resolve that issue. We will  figure out a way to resolve  it. The  chairman is fully on board with the direction in which this Congress is going.  He is certainly aware and understands  the importance of dealing with this.  I am really surprised. I will express  that surprise. This means we are derailed for at least a week. I cannot  imagine the urgency of the bill on class  action suits.  I will ask our deputy minority leader  as to what the estimate is for that bill.  It will take, I assume, the whole week,  will it not?  ",2004
918,3,2004-05-21,Mr. REID.," I doubt very seriously we  can  finish the class action bill the  week we get back. It would be a rare  occasion in the annals of legislation  that we could finish this very contentious bill. It may pass, but it will pass  by a slim margin. I am sure there will  have to be a cloture vote on it at some  time. It is a bill that need not be done  now.  If class action law does not change  this whole year, it will be uncomfortable for some people, but it is not a  life- or-death matter, as is this bill of  the two managers. This class action is  a convenience for businesses and lawyers.  ",2004
919,3,2004-05-21,Mr. WARNER.," I thank my colleague  for our colloquy this morning.  I see members of our committee on  either side. I suggest, following the distinguished Senator from Colorado, the  distinguished Senator from Hawaii be  recognized. I make that not as a unanimous consent but as a courtesy, and  the Senator from Michigan and I can  proceed.  ",2004
920,3,2004-05-21,Mr. LEVIN.," I wonder if the Senator  from Hawaii wishes  to  speak  this  morning and whether it would be all  right if we sequenced Senator AKAKA  immediately  after Senator ALLARD,  and we will put that in the RECORD. I  suggest we make that a unanimous  consent.  ",2004

931,10,2004-05-21,Mr. DORGAN.," Madam President, this  week  the Congress  and  the White  House have spent a fair amount of time  talking about the subject of gasoline  prices. Gas prices are now averaging  over $2 a gallon across the country. It  is a serious problem for American families, for American businesses, and for  industries such as the airlines. I will  talk a bit about that.  Elbows and wrists and hands are  nearly out of joint from every side of  the political spectrum pointing fingers  during the last week about who is responsible for this or that or the other  thing, who is responsible for high oil  prices. That is counterproductive.  However, we cannot, all of us, decide  that  this  is not happening on our  watch. It is. We cannot decide that it is  not of consequence. It certainly is of  great consequence to our country, to  our economy, and to American families.  I pulled up behind an old Chevrolet  one day at a 40A stop in North Dakota  some while ago. This 15- or 20-year-old  Chevrolet had a bumper sticker on the  back bumper, half of which was sort of  tilted downward  from previous beatings. The bumper sticker said ‘‘I fought  the gas war and gas won.’’  I thought to myself, that is a prophetic bumper sticker. It is hard to  fight a gas war and win when we have  all of these events conspired against  us. We have OPEC countries that control a substantial amount of product  which have formed a cartel and they  decide what  they are pumping and  what they will send to the oil pipelines  around the world.  In addition to that, the oil companies  themselves have gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, behemoth companies  that control substantial amounts of  product.  Then we have the consumer at the  end of the line. They take the gas hose  out of the socket at the gas station,  they put it in the gas tank and start  pumping, and there is not a thing they  can do except pay the price, whatever  the price is.  Why is this important, especially for  rural States? I come from a rural State  in this country. In rural States, we  drive a lot more. We use a lot more  fuel. I come from a State that is 10  times  the  size of Massachusetts  in  landmass. North Dakota is 10 Massachusetts  in  landmass. Yet we have  642,000 people spread out in that big old  landmass. It is not much of anything  to drive 50 miles or 100 miles or 200  miles to do a piece of business or to see  relatives. Do that on the east coast,  and they want to pack a tent in case  they have trouble driving 50 miles.  But in our State we drive a lot, and  we have a farming industry that uses a  lot of fuel. So in the State of North Dakota, for example, per capita, we use  twice as much gasoline as they would  in New York per capita. That means  VerDate May 04 2004  02:52 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21MY6.026 S21PT1 ",2004
932,17,2004-05-21,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, I also  have an amendment to Section 833 of  the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2005 providing for  improvements  and  accountability  measures in the test program which  permits large prime contractors to develop company- or unit-wide subcontracting plans.  This amendment is designed to ensure that the test program undergoes  appropriate evaluation and monitoring  in order to enable accurate assessment  of the effects of the test approach on  subcontracting opportunities for small  business.  Currently,  the Federal Acquisition  Regulation  and  customary  procurement practices require prime contractors to prepare subcontracting plans  with a particular contract or potential  contract in mind. The test program,  which operates as an exception to this  rule, was authorized in the National  Defense Authorization Act for FYs 1990  and 1991. The purpose of the test program was  to explore whether comprehensive subcontract planning could  prove to be an adequate alternative for  achieving meaningful  small business  subcontracting at lesser cost.  In April 2004, the General Accounting  Office issued a report entitled  ‘‘Contract Management: DoD Needs Measures  for Small Business Contracting  and Better Data  on Foreign  Subcontracts,’’ GAO–04–381, where it found  the test program’s results inconclusive  and criticized the Defense Department  for  failing  to  adopt measurement  metrics to meaningfully evaluate the  test program. Despite this report, the  Armed Services Committee approved a  five-year extension of the test program  in Section 833 of the Act.  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I am deeply concerned that the  program fails to live up to its purpose  as a test, and I question the prudence  of extending this test program without  proper  standards and procedures  to  measure  its success. My amendment  provides a certain deadline for the DoD  to institute the needed measurement  metrics and freezes the expansion of  the program until these metrics are in  place. The amendment also provides  for oversight by the GAO.  f  PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  ",2004
933,17,2004-05-21,Ms. SNOWE.," Lastly, Mr. President, I  have an amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2005 to strike Section 811(b) of the  act, which alters disclosure requirements for subcontracting information  provided to small businesses through  the Procurement Technical Assistance  Program  of  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency.  This amendment will  ensure  that  small businesses seeking federal subcontracting  opportunities  through  PTAP would continue to have adequate  point-of-contact  information  for procurements up to $1 million.  The Procurement Technical Assistance Program assists small businesses  by providing training and information  about  federal business opportunities,  both prime and subcontracts. Under  the terms of this program, the DLA  joins forces with State, local, and tribal governments for the purpose of delivering technical assistance services  to businesses that are new to federal  procurement.  Current  law  requires  that  experienced defense contractors with over  $500,000 in contract awards disclose to  assistance providers the contact information for their executives with authority  to  enter  into  subcontracts.  These disclosures must be made only  once a year. The cost of disclosures is  practically non-existent. However, the  disclosure requirement materially advances the purpose of the program by  allowing small businesses easy access  to potential subcontracts.  Nevertheless, Section 811(b) of the  act seeks to exempt experienced defense contractors  from these annual  disclosures unless they receive over $1  million in government contracts. The  need for this change is, at best, questionable. Providing a few names and  phone numbers once a year is hardly a  significant burden. As  chair of  the  Small Business Committee, I am concerned that this change would needlessly obscure the procurement process  for small business. I urge the Senate to  retain the current PTAP disclosure requirements.  ∑",2004

938,24,2004-05-21,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, May 31 is  Memorial Day, the day we set aside  each year to remember and to honor  those men and women who gave their  lives in service to our Nation.  Memorial Day used to be called Decoration Day in the old South—the day  that we reminisce in our memories of  our past, our locking with hands or  words our lives with others, our children, grandchildren, and people whose  voice is forever stilled.  This year, this day has even more  meaning as we once again find our men  and women in uniform engaged in hostilities in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Freedom does not come cheap. It is  too often paid for not only in dollars  but in the lives of America’s best sons  and daughters.  All across the Nation out there, all  across  the prairies,  the plains,  the  green valleys, the mountains, the rivers, the rust belt, the East, the North,  the South, and the West—all across the  Nation,  families will be visiting the  gravesites of their loved ones.  Long,  long be our hearts of such  memories filled like the vase in which  roses have once been distilled. You  may break, you may shatter, the vase  if you will, but the scent of the roses  will hang round it still.  Among rows of tombstones adorned  with small American flags, they will  lay wreathes and pay their respects to  those who have  served our country  with honor and distinction in our Nation’s wars.  This national tribute will provide the  opportunity  for mothers and  fathers  not only to tell their children about  the sacrifices of their ancestors and  relatives but also to pass on valuable  lessons about history and about humanity. But even when our world is  beset with the worst of human nature,  the best of human nature can  rise  above it all.  I am reminded today of the story of  the  ‘‘Immortal Chaplains’’ of World  War II, Rev. George I. Fox, Rev. Clark  V. Poling, Father John P. Washington,  and Rabbi Alexander D. Goode. When  the  U.S  troopship  Dorchester  was  torpedoed by a Nazi submarine, with  only minutes to live, these four chaplains  calmly handed out what  lifejackets there were on the ship to the  panicking passengers, the soldiers and  sailors. When they ran out of life preservers to hand out, what did these  four chaplains do?  Can you see it? Can you envision a  moment like that?  They took off their own  life preservers and gave them away. They gave  them to others so others might live.  Then, as the Dorchester was sinking,  what did they do? They locked arms  and prayed, and sank to their watery  graves. They prayed, locked arms, and  went to their watery graves.  While some among us might not hesitate to take off that life preserver and  give it to our spouse, certainly, our  child, or a parent, how many of us  would give it to a stranger, as did the  immortal  chaplains.  Self-sacrifice,  unity, and respect for each other and  each other’s faith were the qualities  they displayed that night, and in so  doing these four chaplains of four different faiths demonstrated their deep  faith in God and they honored the mission of our great Nation.  These four chaplains, as I say, were  of different faiths. Two were Protestant ministers, was one a Jewish rabbi,  and the fourth was a Roman Catholic  priest. But they were united as one in  their devotion to their Maker, their  love for their fellow man, and their  willingness to sacrifice so that others  might  live. It was these convictions  that inspired one of the most memorable events not just of World War II  but of all time.  Memorials in their honor have been  built in the country. The U.S. War Department posthumously awarded them  the Distinguished Service Crosses. The  U.S. Postal Service  issued a special  stamp to commemorate their sacrifice.  Congress has honored them by authorizing the Four Chaplains Medal and  with a resolution designating a Four  Chaplains Day.  Think about it. Amidst all the great  and important military leaders such as  Generals Patton, MacArthur, and Eisenhower, amidst all  the great and  powerful political leaders of that war  such as Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, we also remember these  four humble men of God.  Yes, think about it. Amidst all of the  destruction and all of the carnage of  that war, destruction, and carnage in  the form of an Auschwitz, Pearl Harbor, Dresden, and Hiroshima, we remember  the  immortal chaplains  for  their act of kindness and mercy.  Yes, think about it. Amidst all the  misery and tragedy of that war, amidst  all the hate and all the horror of that  war, we still remember the four chaplains and their act of heroism and love.  Today, a half century later, we again  find ourselves in a terrified world, a  world that we did not seek, a terrifying  world, a world that we did not want but  one in which we must endure if we are  to prevail. War, disease, crime, and terrorism have transformed our land into  a code red world.  Every generation has  its  turmoil.  That is, sadly, the way of the world.  And this particular terrifying era of  adversity and challenge in which we  now find ourselves, we would do well to  bear in mind those immortal chaplains,  the four who refused to succumb to  fear and performed  selfless acts of  kindness and mercy.  They  truly,  truly  personified  the  greatest of men in all generations. The  sacrifice of those four men endures as  an inspiring act of humanity. For as  Jesus said: Greater love hath no man  than this, that a man lay down his life  for another.  So on this Memorial Day, we will  pray as we remember those American  service men and women who now stand  in harm’s way yonder on the other side,  yonder in a faraway land. We will pray  for those who are serving our Nation in  the dangerous climates of Iraq and Afghanistan. They are doing their duty  for the families they love, and we will  pray for their families and for the families who have already lost loved ones,  who daily see that empty chair at the  table, the chair which never again will  be filled, that place at the table which  will forever be empty.  And as we pray, we will recall the  words of the Scriptures from Psalm 127:  ‘‘Except the Lord build the house, they  labor in vain that build it: except the  Lord keep  the  city,  the watchman  waketh but in vain.’’  So I close with lines written by Joyce  Kilmer.  ‘‘DULCEETDECORUMEST’’  The bugle echoes shrill and sweet,  But not of war it sings to-day.  The road is rhythmic with the feet  Of men-at-arms who come to pray.  The roses blossom white and red  On tombs where weary soldiers lie;  Flags wave above the honored dead  And martial music cleaves the sky.  Above their wreath-strewn graves we kneel,  They kept the faith and fought the fight.  Through flying lead and crimson steel  They plunged for Freedom and the Right.  May we, their grateful children, learn  Their strength, who lie beneath this sod,  Who went through fire and death to earn  At last the accolade of God.  In shining rank on rank arrayed  They march, the legions of the Lord;  He is their Captain unafraid,  The Prince of Peace  . . . Who brought a  sword.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2004

This year is a special time because  we will dedicate a  long awaited national memorial for the 16 million men  and women who fought in World War  II, including the 400,000 Americans who  paid the ultimate sacrifice  for their  country during the war.

940,31,2004-05-21,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landmark 1954 civil rights  decision of Brown v. Board of Education. In  its decision, the Supreme  Court held that the Equal Protection  Clause of the  fourteenth amendment  prohibits States from maintaining racially segregated public schools.  In Brown, the Court upheld the principle that America is a land of laws,  not men.  In Brown, the Court affirmed that  equality, fairness, and justice are for  all Americans,  irrespective of  race,  ethnicity, color, or creed.  The Supreme Court found that the  segregation of white and black children  in public schools denied black children  the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.  The Court reached this decision even  if  the physical  facilities and other  ‘‘tangible’’ factors of white and black  schools were equal.  Of course, we all know that the facilities and resources were  far  from  being equal.  It took courage on the part of the  nine Justices  of  the U.S. Supreme  Court to reverse the so-called ‘‘separate but equal’’ precedent  that  the  Court had created in the 1896 case of  Plessy v. Ferguson.  The Plessy decision concerned a 30-  year-old  shoemaker  named  Homer  Plessy who had been jailed for sitting  in the ‘‘White’’ car of the East Louisiana Railroad. Plessy was only one-  eighth black and seven-eighth white,  but under Louisiana law, he was considered black and therefore required to  sit in the ‘‘Colored’’ car.  In Plessy, the Supreme Court found  that laws requiring separate black and  white railroad cars did not conflict  with the thirteenth amendment which  abolished slavery.  The Court held that ‘‘a statute which  implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races has  no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races.’’ Consequently,  the noxious notion of  ‘‘separate but  equal’’ took root in America.  The lone dissenter in the Plessy case,  Justice John Harlan, wrote, ‘‘Our Constitution  is color-blind, and neither  knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law.’’ Justice  Harlan was a half-century ahead of his  time.  After years of arguing discrimination  cases throughout the Nation, a team of  NAACP lawyers, led by Thurgood Marshall, brought five case from Kansas,  South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware,  and Washington DC to the Supreme  Court. Thurgood Marshall—one of the  giants of American history—stood before the Supreme Court determined to  rid this Nation of a ‘‘failure of our constitutional system.’’  In Brown, the Court ruled that in the  United States and under the U.S. Constitution, ‘‘separate’’ is inherently unequal.  These words were profound then and  there are equally profound today because when the Supreme Court struck  down school legal segregation, it advanced the cause of human rights in  America and set an example for all the  world.  I just visited the ‘‘Separate and Unequal’’ exhibit at the Smithsonian. I  was struck by how one of the displays  put it: the Brown decision told Americans and the world that ‘‘the American  dream of ethnic diversity and racial  equality under the law is a dream of  justice for all.’’  Although  the Brown  decision  declared the system of legal segregation  unconstitutional,  the Court  ordered  only that the States end segregation  with  ‘‘all deliberate speed.’’ One dictionary definition of  ‘‘deliberate’’  is  ‘‘leisurely or slow in manner or motion.’’  This ambiguity over how to enforce  the ruling gave segregationists an opportunity to organize what came to be  called  ‘‘massive  resistance.’’ Many  State officials in the South responded  to the Brown decision by promising to  use all legal means and resources under  their command to prevent integration.  In Prince Edward County, VA, for example—one of the cases decided in the  Brown decision—the school district’s  response was  to  close  the  public  schools in Farmville for 5 years, from  1959 to 1964. White students enrolled in  private schools while a generation of  black children was denied access to  education.  Over the 50 years since Brown, this  Nation has continued to wrestle with  issues of racial and ethnic equality.  As I stand here today to pay homage  to the Brown decision and the civil  rights struggle, I feel compelled to ask,  ‘‘A half-century after Brown, how far  have we come? Where we are today,  and where are we headed?’’  Fifty years after the Brown decision,  the struggle for equality has come to  include not only racial and ethnic minorities, but also women, the disabled,  and gays and lesbians. That is a promising development.  We need only remember that it is  only this week when the Massachusetts  Supreme Court’s order recognizing gay  marriages is given the full effect of  law.  Since the 1954 Brown decision, we  have made progress in the sense that  Americans overwhelmingly  repudiate  discrimination and segregation.  But while we no longer see the blatant vestiges of the segregationist era  such as signs saying ‘‘whites only’’ or  ‘‘colored only,’’ our  society  is  still  plagued by inequality and injustice.  African Americans have yet to enjoy  true racial equality in this Nation. And  in the absence of real equality, African  Americans are being denied the essence  of what it means to be an American.  Statistics are the clearest barometer  for measuring our progress and far too  many  of  them  reveal  that African  Americans  continue  to  lag  behind  whites in important ways.  In April 2004, the Nation’s unemployment rate was 4.9 percent for whites;  for blacks, it was 9.7 percent.  In 2002, the poverty rate was 12.1 percent nationwide; for blacks, it was 22.7  percent.  In 1999, median income for white families was $51,244; for black families, it  was $31,778.  Today, black men make up 41 percent  of all prisoners, but only 4 percent of  all college and university students.  African Americans are 13 percent of  the population in my home State of  New Jersey, but they constituted a  staggering 63 percent of the State’s  prison population in 2002.  The murder rate for whites is 3.3 per  100,000 people; for blacks, it’s six times  as high, 20.5 per 100,000 people.  These statistics make it pretty clear  that while we have come a long way  from the blatant racism of ‘‘separate  but equal’’ and the decision to close  the Farmville public schools to prevent  their integration, we still have a long  way to go in making the dream of justice and equality for all Americans a  living, breathing reality.  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Brown decision, we need  to  rededicate ourselves  to  the civil  rights  struggle. As Teddy Roosevelt  said, ‘‘This country will not be a really  good place for any of us to live in if it  is not a really good place for all of us  to live in.’’  ",2004
941,31,2004-05-21,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr President,  50  years ago, our Nation set out to give  every child the chance for excellence  and equality in education. In a quote  from the Brown decision in 1954, the  U.S. Supreme Court said, ‘‘Today education is perhaps the most important  function of State and  local governments . . . It is a principal instrument  in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to  adjust normally to his environment. In  these days, it is doubtful that any child  may reasonably be expected to succeed  in life if he is denied the opportunity of  an  education. Such an opportunity,  where the State has undertaken to provide it, is a right, which must be made  available to all on equal terms.’’ We  have made great progress in the past 50  years but we still have a long way to  go.  By fulfilling the promise of Brown,  school systems have the ability to lay  a great foundation for our Nation.

It is outrageous.  The President has raised plenty of  money for his campaign. Over 200 million dollars. Why does he need to use  Medicare funds?  With taxpayer money, the Bush administration produced so-called ‘‘video  news released’’ —fake news stories that  hailed the new Medicare law—and distributed them to TV stations across  the country.

945,199,2004-05-21,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, before  closing,  I want  to mention  several  things that have occurred over the past  several weeks on a different topic. We  are an evenly divided body in the Senate, and people say they haven’t seen  more partisanship ever in their lives  than over  the  last  several years.  I  know that is true, but at the same time  all of us, both sides of the aisle, recognize we were sent here to govern and to  serve the national interest.  As we prepare  to  enter  into our  weeklong Memorial Day recess, very  quickly I want to look back and share  what progress we have made. Two days  ago we passed Project Bioshield. It was  supported by 99 Senators with a resounding yes. Project Bioshield, proposed by the President in his 2003 State  of the Union Address, is comprehensive  legislation  that  encourages  research  and encourages the development of new  cutting-edge countermeasures to fight  biological terrorism, chemical warfare,  terrorism used with radiological or nuclear weapons. It is critical to our national security. This body came together and 2 days ago passed this important piece of legislation.  We also passed the JOBS bill which  will protect more than 1 million high-  quality manufacturing  jobs  in  the  United States. It cut taxes, a Euro tax  that was going up at $40 million a  month in this country on 100 American-made products.  Last week we passed, in terms of education, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. That special education bill refocuses our Federal law on  outcomes for disabled children. It affects over 6.5 million children in this  country and well over 400,000 special  education teachers.  In the  field of taxation and technology, we passed an Internet access  tax  moratorium  extension  which  makes sure that we will be able to continue to access and promote broadband  technologies. We are going  to  conference on the bill. We had agreement  last week, actually last night, to go to  the highway bill with the appointment  of conferees. We have been able in the  past week to come to an accommodation on the appointment of the President’s judicial nominations.  We  confirmed  the  nomination  of  Marcia Cooke. We  confirmed  John  Negroponte to become American Ambassador to Iraq. The Senate has been  productive, and I thank my colleagues  for their hard work and cooperation.  When we return following Memorial  Day we will go straight to class action  reform. We will also return to the Department of Defense reauthorization.  We have a lot more to do, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues  in a productive, collaborative way as  we move forward.  f  CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT OF  2004—MOTION TO PROCEED  ",2004
946,199,2004-05-21,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, earlier  today the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee  were here to make further progress on  the Department of Defense authorization bill. We have adopted a number of  amendments that have been cleared.  However, we have been unable to vote  on the pending amendment which was  offered by Senator GRAHAM of South  Carolina. In addition, Senator WARNER  has been unable to secure an agreement for a filing deadline or an amendment list. We have a list of possible Republican amendments. However, there  is an objection on the Democratic side  of the aisle to limiting amendments.  Further, many weeks ago we scheduled the class action  legislation  for  when the Senate returns from the upcoming recess. I would add that the  class action bill does have strong bipartisan support, and we would like to finish that bill in a reasonable period of  time. I believe we can, indeed, do just  that. I had hoped we would have been  able to proceed to that bill by consent,  but again there is an objection to proceeding to the class action bill.  I want to reiterate that we are going  to finish the Defense authorization bill.  It is a critical bill, an important bill. It  is a bill we have made progress on this  week. We need to lock in an amendment list on this legislation, the Defense authorization, to allow our managers to work with Senators on their  respective amendments and to make  continued progress. This  is a vital  piece of legislation, and we will return  to the bill.  My intention is to go to the class action bill and then return to the Defense  authorization bill.  Thus, I now ask unanimous consent  that at 2:15 on Tuesday, June 1, the  Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 430, S. 2062, the class action bill.  ",2004
947,199,2004-05-21,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  objection?  ,2004
948,199,2004-05-21,Mr. REID.," Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are very disappointed that the distinguished majority leader is going to file cloture on  this matter. We have said on more than  one occasion we are willing to work toward completion of the Defense bill.  We cooperated this week. We told the  manager  of  the  bill,  both Senator  LEVINand I, let’s go off of the Lindsey  Graham amendment. We will agree to a  2-hour  limitation of  time when we  come back next Tuesday to dispose of  that and the Cantwell amendment that  she would have offered. But that wasn’t  to be done. We indicated at that time  that we would waste a lot of time.  We had a bipartisan amendment by  Senator DASCHLEand Senator LINDSEY  GRAHAMon TRICARE that would have  moved forward. We had one that Senator KENNEDYhad on the reporting. We  were standing by with a number of  amendments ready to go.  I would also say to the distinguished  majority leader, we have supplied to  the  two managers  of  the  bill  our  amendments, as Republicans have supplied amendments. There are about 100  amendments. They cleared a number  this morning.  They  have  cleared  amendments in the past. I would also  say that we take about 10 days on this  bill normally. We don’t think this bill  will take that much time. We believe  that when we come back, we would be  in a position at that time, maybe not  on Tuesday but by Wednesday, enter  into an agreement as  to a  list of  amendments. It is difficult to have our  Members do this with a 10-day break  because we don’t know if there is going  to be another Chalabi problem. We  don’t know if there is going to be another problem dealing with a prison.

949,206,2004-05-21,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative MILLER’s Motion to Instruct Conferees on Overtime.  The Bush Administration recently released  their final regulations on overtime pay—regulations that originally called for the elimination of  overtime pay for millions of workers including  America’s police and firefighters.  While the final regulations omitted this group  at  the  last possible minute—due  to extreme  Democratic  pressure—let’s  remember  their  true intentions, that of eliminating overtime pay  to the police and firefighters of America.  It is so hypocritical for the Republicans to  come up here and pass  resolutions  celebrating the New York City fire and police departments—and then cut their pay.  No one enters law enforcement or becomes  a  firefighter  for  the money—but Republicans  had the audacity to suggest that these hard-  working men and women are not entitled to  overtime that they and their families depend  on.  While they have had the incredible vision to  reconsider their original request, everyone in  this chamber knows—and more threatening to  the Republicans—every police officer and firefighter in America knows—or will know—that if  the Bush Administration and  the Congressional Republican majorities are back next  year, it is a foregone conclusion that they will  revisit these overtime regulations and will succeed  in  their  initial dream of eliminating all  overtime  for all cops and  firefighters  in  the  U.S.  The Administration and this Congress have  a sad track record of shortchanging police and  firefighters, while pretending  to  stand with  them.  And now their revised ‘‘compassionate conservative’’ overtime regulations eliminate overtime protections for millions of other American  workers.  I  received a  letter  from a woman  in  the  Bronx who  is a dedicated and experienced  health care provider.  She,  like other health care providers  that  support us in our times of need, is being told  by the Republicans that she might not be entitled to overtime.  She writes that she is concerned that overtime work without overtime pay will not only  hurt workers  like her, but will also hurt patients.  How can that be construed as being supportive of American workers or as being supportive of America?  Sadly, this Administration’s record does little  to suggest that they understand or care about  the needs of American workers.  This Administration’s record on labor issues  is horrific—besides working to destroy the entire concept of overtime pay,  they have attacked and tried to eliminate the Davis-Bacon  prevailing wage provisions for our road builders and building trades workers.  This Administration  has  started  denying  COLAs to federal civilian employees—COLAs  they are more  than happy  to reward  themselves with.  This Administration has opposed legislation  to allow workers to create unions so that they  get better wages and benefits  that benefit  themselves and their families.  The destruction of 3 million jobs, the serious  attempt to eliminate overtime provisions in our  country, and working to crack the Davis-Bacon  law—this  is an Administration  that does not  care for working people.  Support the Miller amendment and let the  Republicans know—you are sick and tired of  these overpaid, underworked people trying to  cut your pay while raising theirs.  f  TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY HO  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  ",2004
950,206,2004-05-21,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commend Mr. Anthony Chung Yi Ho, Senior  Officer with the Taipei Economic Council and  Cultural Representative and Senior Assistant  to  the Honorable C.J. Chen, Taiwan’s chief  representative  in  the United States. Mr. Ho  has been with the Washington, DC, office of  the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs  for 6  years, and his presence will be sorely missed  when he returns to Taiwan later this year. Mr.  Ho is a true asset to the Taiwan Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. His leadership and expertise  have been  invaluable  in working with my  Washington, DC, staff and many other congressional offices as well.  Traditionally, Idaho maintains a close relationship with  the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. Idaho State University has developed  a strong partnership with the Taiwan Ministry  of Foreign Affairs,  in  large part because of  ISU’s English and Professional Development  Program. This unique program, the only program of its kind in the United States, provides  a language and cultural education program for  junior diplomatic officers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over 40 students have completed  the program since  its  inception  in  the early  1990s, and many of  these graduates now  serve  their  country  in  diplomatic  postings  throughout the world. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs Language and Culture Training Program at ISU is an excellent collaborative relationship  that  is strengthening our countries  through a better understanding of each of our  cultures.  While serving as a Senior Officer, Mr. Ho  has worked closely with my office. Largely  thanks to his efforts, I have been able to meet  and work with many of Taiwan’s junior diplomatic officers attending this program at Idaho  State University. They are an intelligent, energetic group who are eager to serve their country. They are very  interested  in gaining as  much knowledge and insight as possible during their stay in America and look forward to  using  what  they  have  learned  as  they  progress in their diplomatic careers.  Under Mr. Ho’s guidance, our office has cultivated a valuable relationship with the Taiwan  Foreign Ministry. He arranged a dinner among  the junior diplomatic officers and myself in Pocatello, and he has also worked with our office  to arrange the stay of a junior officer from ISU  in our Washington, DC, office. For 2 years, I  have had the privilege of hosting a junior officer from the ISU program in the Capitol.  Mr. Ho’s excellent collaborative relationship  with my office plays a critical role to strengthening relations between the United States and  Taiwan through strong communication and a  better understanding of each of our cultures. I  commend Anthony Ho for his dedication and  guidance. It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with him, and we will greatly miss  him when he leaves Washington, DC.  f  RECOGNITION OF ASIAN/PACIFIC  AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH  HON. JOHN SHIMKUS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  ",2004
951,206,2004-05-21,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the designation by President Bush  that the month of May be known as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.  The more  than 13 million Americans who  have Asian/Pacific heritage have worked diligently to enrich the culture of our Nation and  of our lives.  Asian/Pacific Americans are a growing and  welcome  force  in my home state of  Illinois.  Their continuing contributions to our communities, whether as large as Chicago, or as medium sized as my hometown of Collinsville,  are immeasurable.  Asian/Pacific Americans bring with them a  heritage of pride, hard work, commitment  to  family and faith, and a love of freedom that  serves as an example and reminder for all of  us.  I am proud of the President for his recognition of the Asian/Pacific American community  and of their overall value to our nation’s future.  I salute the Asian/Pacific American community  and join them in celebrating their heritage.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

I oppose this amendment.  VerDate May 04 2004  04:36 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20MY8.027 E21PT1 ",2004
953,213,2004-05-21,Mr. EHLERS.," Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  introduce legislation that will move our Nation  forward with increased environmental protection and restoration of the Great Lakes—the  Great Lakes Protection and Restoration Committee Act.  The Great Lakes are a national  treasure  that we need to protect and restore. They contain 95 percent of our nation’s surface freshwater, provide drinking water  to millions of  people and form the backbone for billions of  dollars  in shipping,  trade,  fishing and recreation. Progress has been made in improving  environmental conditions  in  the Great Lakes  Basin, but  the  lakes continue  to  face many  threats, including pollution from contaminated  sediments, stormwater and agricultural runoff,  the introduction of invasive species, wetlands  and  coastal  habitat  loss,  and  pollutants  washed into the lakes from the atmosphere.  While several federal, state, provincial and  local programs have been developed  to address these problems, these strategies are not  well coordinated. According to an April 2003  GAO Report, ‘‘no one overarching strategy or  plan unifies these strategies in the pursuit of  a common goal. . . An overarching strategy  for the basin is needed to establish restoration  goals, outline how restoration will occur, identify the resources needed to achieve restoration, assign accountability for restoration, and  provide a mechanism for measuring progress  for achieving goals.’’  This week, President Bush signed an Executive Order that establishes a task force to improve  the coordination of  federal agency efforts and to reach out to state, local, and private partners  to develop consistent policies  and strategies  for Great Lakes restoration.  I  strongly support the action taken by President  Bush, EPA Administrator Leavitt, and Council  on  Environmental  Quality  Chairman  Connaughton because  it will help bring collaboration among the broad collection of existing resources and programs in the region.  Next we need comprehensive legislation to  continue to move us forward. The Great Lakes  Protection and Restoration Committee Act will  provide a path forward by bringing together all  of  the stakeholders  in  the basin,  led by  the  Great Lakes State governors with the aid of  relevant  federal agency officials,  tribal  representatives, scientific experts and environmental and industry stakeholders. The Committee created by the legislation will develop a  specific and comprehensive strategy  for  the  purpose of protecting, preserving and restoring  the Great Lakes.  Specifically, the task force will:  Assess accomplishments from current programs over the past 10 years;  Analyze the prospects for achieving restoration goals under current programs and authorities for the next 10 years;  Prioritize restoration goals identified by the  Great Lakes governors;  Develop specific, measurable benchmarks  for achieving those goals;  Recommend legislative options for obtaining  such additional authority and funding as are  necessary to achieve those goals;  Suggest methods  to  improve coordination  among  the existing  federal, state, provincial,  local, and non-governmental programs operating in the Great Lakes; and  Report  to Congress and  the President  in  one year on  its  findings and  recommendations.  My goal is that the task force will develop a  comprehensive, strategic protection and restoration program to bring together and coordinate the plethora of smaller programs that we  have in place now.  This serious and measured approach mirrors the steps taken in other large ecosystem  restoration projects such as  the Everglades  and Chesapeake Bay. Due to the complexity  of  those  restoration  initiatives, which cross  over many  jurisdictional  lines, environmental  challenges and scientific disciplines, it was essential  to have an overall strategic plan  in  place to guide activities and funding decisions  over  long periods of  time. The Great Lakes  Basin  is significantly  larger and  the environmental challenges substantially more complex  than in those ecosystems. We need an overarching strategy in place to accomplish our vision to protect and restore the lakes.  A lack of adequate funding is certainly an  impediment to successful cleanup efforts, but  improved program coordination and operation  under a comprehensive strategic plan  is an  essential first step. The Great Lakes Protection and Restoration Committee Act will move  Great Lakes restoration forward to help protect  and clean up this global treasure. I urge all of  my colleagues to support this legislation.  f  ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT OF  THE  STATE  OF  ISRAEL, MR.  MOSHE KATSAV, AT THE PRESIDENT’S  PALACE  IN  BERLIN,  APRIL 28, 2004  HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  ",2004
954,213,2004-05-21,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  recently attended  the Conference on Anti-Semitism of  the Organization for Security and Cooperation  in Europe (OSCE) in Berlin from April 28–29,  2004. I was privileged to attend as part of the  official U.S. delegation, in my capacity as the  Ranking Member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), commonly known as  the Helsinki Commission.  I  was pleased  to give a speech at  the Berlin  Conference, after visiting  the concentration  camps  in Auschwitz, on  the  importance of  fighting intolerance and speaking out against  acts of anti-Semitism. Secretary of State Colin  Powell attended  the Conference and spoke  forcefully about the need to combat anti-Semitism. Mr. LANTOS of California,  the Ranking  Member of  the  International Relations Committee, has already introduced Secretary Powell’s statement into the RECORD. The 55 Participating States of  the OSCE adopted a  strong action plan,  the Berlin Declaration,  which lays out specific steps for states to take  regarding Holocaust education, data collection  and monitoring of hate crimes against Jews,  and improved coordination between non-governmental organizations and European law enforcement agencies.  During our Conference, on the evening of  April 28, President Johannes Rau of Germany  hosted a dinner for the President of the State  of  Israel Moshe Katsav. President Katsav  spoke powerfully about  the need  to combat  the rising tide of anti-Semitism throughout the  world. Let me  just highlight one section of  President Katsav’s remarks:  The violence against the Jews in Europe is  evidence that anti-Semitism, which we have  not known since the Second World War, is on  the rise. This trend of the new anti-Semitism  is a result of the aggressive propaganda,  made  possible  by modern  technologies,  globalization and abuse of democracy and  which creates an infrastructure for developing and  increasing anti-Semitism, of a  kind we have not known before * * * Many  times I have heard voices saying that anti-  Semitism is not unique and that it is no different from other kinds of racism. Anti-Semitism should  indeed receive special attention. Hatred against the Jews has existed for  many generations and it is rooted in many  cultures and continents through the world.  However, now anti-Semitism has become an  instrument for achieving political aims * * *  The genocide of the Jews was the result of  anti-Semitism and was not caused by a war  between countries or a territorial conflict  and, therefore, anti-Semitism  is a special  danger for world Jewry and the whole of Europe.  Let me draw my colleagues attention to a  particularly  important part of  the Berlin Declaration,  in which  the OSCE  participating  States  ‘‘declare[d] unambiguously  that  international development of political  issues,  including  those  in  Israel or elsewhere  in  the  Middle East, never justify anti-Semitism.’’ Let  me be clear that I am not seeking to suppress  legitimate criticism of Israel, just as I would not  seek to silence those who criticize the policies  of the U.S. Government. However, when individuals criticize the very existence of the Jewish state, equate Zionism with  racism, and  compare the Israeli Government to the Nazi  regime, then all of us must say together: this  is anti-Semitism, and you have crossed  the  line.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the full text of the Israeli President’s remarks  at the President’s Palace in Berlin be placed  in the RECORD, and I urge my colleagues to  read President Katsav’s thoughtful remarks.

We, world Jewry, believed that after the  terrible events of the Holocaust, it would not  be necessary to struggle against anti-Semitism.  We believed that the world would not allow  anti-Semitism to raise its head.  We believed that anti-Semitism belonged  to the old world and to distant history.  We very much appreciate this gathering in  Berlin. This  step  to  fight anti-Semitism  sends a very important message that this  issue has a significant place in the European  VerDate May 04 2004  04:36 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A20MY8.054 E21PT1 ",2004
955,220,2004-05-21,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  congratulate Michael Palmer for over 14 years  of dedicated service as a member of the Temple City Unified School District Board of Education.  Mike Palmer  is a dedicated supporter of  public education. He  is  recognized and  respected by the community for his unique educational  vision. From November 28, 1989  through April 22, 2004, he faithfully served as  a member of the Temple City Unified School  District Board of Education.  Mike Palmer  is an admired and  integral  member of the Temple City community. He is  strongly committed  to providing a superior  educational experience for students in the district. He has been elected by the residents of  TCUSD to serve four terms on the Board of  Education. His outstanding leadership on the  board has helped guide and influence his fellow board members  to make  the best decisions for students and faculty in the District.  I ask all Members of Congress to join me  today in congratulating Michael Palmer for a  truly exemplary public service career, and for  his immense commitment to the Temple City  Unified School District.

956,220,2004-05-21,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, as far as we can  remember, we have dreamed of reaching the  stars. Since its inception in 1958, NASA has  helped us realize  those dreams. They have  taken us into space, placed Americans on the  moon, and opened our eyes by exceeding  feats once deemed unreachable.  Today, I want to congratulate Mount View  Middle School,  located  in Welch, West Virginia, for being selected to participate in the  NASA Explorer School Program. As the first  school in West Virginia to be chosen for this  prestigious and exciting educational adventure, I am pleased that many of our children  in Southern West Virginia will have the opportunity to be exposed to the world of science  and engineering in a new and exciting way.  We must focus attention on our future astronauts, scientists, and engineers who will take  us even farther than we dare to dream today.  They are our children and our students, and  with  them our hope rests. We must nurture  them and give them the resources they need  to  advance  their  studies;  enhancing  their  learning and expanding their opportunities so  that when it is their time to shine not even the  darkest day will dim their light.  The NASA Explorer School Program will  help train our math and science teachers and  school administrators,  for  it  is our  teachers  that can provide the spark that ignites our passion, and  they  lay  the basic  foundations of  education necessary for the success of our future expeditions  into space. Advancing  the  knowledge and skills of our teachers will only  improve the development of our students.  The benefits of engaging and educating children in the world of science and engineering  cannot be overstated. Programs such as the  NASA Explorer Schools Program enable our  students to explore these important subjects at  a level and intensity that they might not otherwise experience.  I once again congratulate  Mount View Middle School for being selected  to participate in this exciting program, and I  look  forward  to hearing about  their  related  successes.  With the impending challenges ahead, not  only today but for generations to come, can  we afford not to be ready? By ensuring that  our students, our future NASA scientists and  engineers, are well prepared  for  the  trials  ahead, we can ensure that our future in the  skies is as bright as the stars above.  The future of NASA is the future of man.  And, as we look toward our future we are reminded of the words of William Faulkner when  he said, ‘‘I believe that man will not merely endure. He will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a  spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and  endurance.’’  ",2004
957,220,2004-05-21,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like to recognize two individuals from my district who have dedicated their lives to making  our country safer. Not only have these men  served our Country in World War II, but they  continue to go beyond their call of duty by providing their services to military funerals and always being available to lend a helping hand  for the community.  Willis A. (Jack) Pangburn, was born on September 3, 1918 in Mystic, Iowa. He served in  the U.S. Army  Infantry  in WWII, and was  wounded  in action. Mr. Pangburn  received  both the Bronze Star and Purple Heart Medals  for his valiant actions. He married Rosemary  who passed away in 1985. Together, they had  one son,  four daughters. Mr. Pangburn  is a  member of the Disabled American Veterans,  and American Legion Veterans of Foreign  Wars, and was Post commander (2 years) of  the VFW.  Mr. Pangburn is honored as this year’s Memorial Day Grand Parade Marshall in Goshen,  Indiana for service as Coordinator of the Military Funeral Detail  from 1987  to 1997. This  unit participates  in all military  funerals  requested by deceased veteran’s families in Goshen. Honorary Color Guard, Flag Presentation, Rifle Salute, and TAPS are all included  in the service. As many as 12 members participate. He presently serves as a member of  this unit. Since 1946 he has helped in placing  4 inch white crosses on deceased VFW Members graves, many of these years he has been  in charge of this work at Oakridge Cemetery.  He continues to ‘‘Ring Bells’’(Santa Claus) for  the Salvation Army, passes out ‘‘Buddy Poppies’’ on Memorial Day  for  the VFW, helps  purchase and delivers  food baskets  to  the  needy at Christmas time, and is still ready to  contribute his time and energy at 85 years of  age.  Warren H. Swartz, was born on May 7,  1924 in Millersburg, Indiana. He served in the  U.S. Navy in WWII as a Gunners Mate in the  South Pacific and part-time Diver. He married  Gerry  in January, 1953. Together  they had  one daughter. Mr. Swartz is a member of the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion,  and Disabled American Veterans, and presently serving as Chaplain of the D.A.V. since  1992.  Mr. Swartz was honored as last year’s Memorial Day Grand Parade Marshall in Goshen  for his service as Coordinator of the Military  Funeral Detail  from 1997  to 2003. He still  serves as a member and, as Chaplain of the  D.A.V., he is called upon to present the American flag to the next of kin frequently.  He is revered by all the men of this detail,  which numbers about 45, by his faithful and  military presence in the fulfillment of his duties. He is willing to travel anywhere to assist  a veteran in need.  VerDate May 04 2004  04:36 May 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20MY8.086 E21PT1 ",2004

This talented youth organization  is  the only musical group  from  the  state of Nevada that will be performing at the  dedication of the WWII Memorial.  Mr. Speaker,  these young musicians will  truly be honoring our veterans and fallen heroes, including those that died in wars past,  and those that have died recently in the war  with Iraq. The Boulder City Hometown Fiddlers  will also be paying tribute to one of Nevada’s  own, Corporal Matthew Commons, of Boulder  City. Corporal Commons was killed while serving in Afghanistan.  They will represent the Silver State and all  those within its borders who wish to pay tribute to those brave men and women who gave  their lives in the name of freedom and democracy. It is with great honor that I stand here  today and recognize this group of fine musicians as they convey our honor, respect, and  gratitude to all those that died and risked their  lives for their country.  f  HONORING  COACH  TIM  MARZUOLA’S  ELECTION  INTO  THE  NATIONAL  WRESTLING  HALL OF FAME  HON.

959,227,2004-05-21,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to a legend in high school wrestling  in Texas, Coach Tim Marzuola of Highland  Park High School. Coach Marzuola has been  elected as a member of  the 2004  induction  class for the National Wrestling Hall of Fame  located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I am proud to  represent Highland Park  in Congress, and  I  have  four graduates of Highland Park High  School  that serve  in my Dallas and Washington, D.C offices. My Washington office  Chief of Staff wrestled  for Coach Marzuola  back when he was at Highland Park High  School.  In 1999, Highland Park’s wrestling team was  nationally ranked and Coach Marzuola was a  national high school coach of the year award-  winner. The Scots won state  titles  in 1999,  2000, and 2003 and placed second in 2002  and 2004. Coach Marzuola has guided  the  Scots  since 1982, and  last  year he was  named as a coach for the tremendously successful Team Texas program. He was  inducted into Texas Hall of Honor in 1994. I am  very proud that he is being recognized nationally for over twenty years of diligent service to  wrestling in Highland Park.  Coach Marzuola’s commitment to his team  on and off of the mats is exceptional, as he  has set a standard for excellence within his  sport. Coach Tim Marzuola has provided his  athletes with exceptional leadership and inspiration, emphasizing to each student the necessary  traits of  individual  responsibility, accountability, and working as a team to accomplish a common goal.  I thank Coach Marzuola for his tireless efforts and service to the greater Highland Park  community.  In addition  to his duties as  the  Head Wresting Coach, he also is a superb Economics and United States History teacher inside the classroom. I wish him and the Highland Park wrestling program all  the best  for  continued success and achievement.  f  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF RON AND  SHARON ESKEW OF URBANA, ILLINOIS  HON. TIMOTHY V.

960,227,2004-05-21,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to celebrate the marriage of my good  friends Ron and Sharon Eskew of Urbana, Illinois. April 3, 2004, marked the 50th anniversary of the day that they exchanged wedding  vows and started a long, happy life together.  Ron Eskew, of Urbana, met his  future wife  Sharon Campbell at Urbana High School  in  the early 1950’s. They were married  in  the  spring of 1953. The bond created by  their  marriage has only grown stronger in the past  5 decades, even during Ron’s active duty in  the United States Army. After his service, the  couple returned to their roots in Urbana, picking up right where they left off. I have known  the Eskews for many years. In fact, when I  was a young man working for a real estate  business, I had the pleasure of selling them  one of their first houses in 1969. Throughout  the years, Ron and Sharon have  filled  that  house with love and a family so caring and  appreciative of the example they set that they  believe  the  rest  of  our  country’s  citizens  should know their happiness as well. Ron and  Sharon’s children certainly admire their devotion to one another after all these years. 50  years is an important milestone few married  couples are fortunate enough to experience. I  salute Ron and Sharon Eskew of Urbana, Illinois on  their 50 happy years  together, and  wish them the best for many years to come.  f  HONORING GINGER L. GRAHAM  AND DR. WILLIAM H.

961,227,2004-05-21,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor two leaders in the health care  industry  from my Congressional District who  have been elected to the Board of Directors  for The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). PhRMA companies are devoted to discovering and developing new medicines that will enable patients  to live longer, healthier and more productive  lives.  In 2002  the companies  invested more  than $32 billion in discovering and developing  new medicines, marking the 32nd straight year  the  industry has  increased  its  investment  in  R&D. PhRMA’s mission is to conduct effective  advocacy  for public policies  that encourage  discovery of important new medicines for patients  by  pharmaceutical  biotechnology  research companies.  The experience and expertise of Ms. Ginger  L. Graham, and Dr. William H. Rastetter will  bring San Diego’s  unique  perspective  to  PhRMA,  the association  that  represents  the  leading  research-based pharmaceutical and  biotechnology companies in the United States.  Ms. Ginger L. Graham has an  impressive  resume. In 1986, she received her MBA from  Harvard University, which began her career at  Lilly. During Ms. Graham’s  time at Lilly she  held management positions in finance, sales,  marketing, and strategic planning.  In 1993,  she was appointed president and CEO of Advanced Cardiovascular Systems. Ms. Graham  was  then a part of  the  team  that  formed  Guidant, a medical technology company. After  taking Guidant public in 1994, she became the  president of Guidant’s Vascular  Intervention  Group. Ms. Graham also held the position of  Group Chairman, Office of  the President, at  Guidant. She is currently the President, CEO,  and Director of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Ms. Graham is the first female ever to be appointed to the board of directors at Phrma.  Dr. William H. Rastetter received his Ph.D.  in 1975  from Harvard. Between 1975 and  1982, he held numerous  faculty positions at  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He  directed  the  Biocatalysts  and  Chemical  Sciences Groups at Genentech from 1982 to  1984. From 1988 to 1993, Dr. Rastetter held  the position of chief financial officer of IDEC  Pharmaceuticals. Then he became president  and CEO of IDEC from 1986 to 2002. During  this  time Dr. Rastetter was appointed chairman of  the  IDEC board of directors. Dr.  Rastetter is currently the executive chairman  of Biogen Idec, Inc.  These two highly qualified individuals have  devoted their careers to improving health care  by  bringing  new  pharmaceutical  products  through research and development and  into  the marketplace.  I am proud  that  these  two  companies from my Congressional District will  be  represented on  the PhRMA Board. San  Diego has attained  the position as  the  third  largest life science cluster in the world, and is  also renowned for being the most highly concentrated and one of the most diverse centers  for life science. As the industry in San Diego  grows and develops further, these two individuals are uniquely positioned  to place San  Diego’s  fingerprint on  the pharmaceutical  industry. As a stalwart supporter of medical research, I am dedicated to ensuring that America’s healthcare system remains  the best  in  the world and to promoting policies that encourage  increased healthcare  innovation.  I  look forward to working with Ms. Graham and  Dr. Rastetter on public policy initiatives.

962,234,2004-05-21,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr. Speaker, today we are  here to discuss the immediate savings that our  nation’s seniors realize due to the prescription  drug discount cards provided by the Medicare  Law that Congress wrote last year. After years  of promises, this law fulfills our commitment to  our nation’s seniors by providing the first ever  universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare.  One would think that these new benefits for  seniors, coupled with the prescription drug discount card would be a cause for celebration.  Rather than educate seniors on the benefits of  the discount cards, the other side of aisle has  continued to play politics with this issue and  resorted to scare tactic towards our nation’s  seniors and in some cases suggest that seniors are too dumb to make decisions for themselves. There are even those who are discouraging seniors from signing up for the discount  card. Perhaps because if seniors sign up, the  program will be a success;  that  is not  just  wrong, it is unconscionable and shameful, and  anyone who engages in that sort of behavior  should be ashamed of themselves.  In my home state of New Jersey we have  a very generous state pharmaceutical assistance program called PAAD. After working with  our Governor and CMS, New Jersey has the  opportunity  to directly enroll seniors  into  the  discount card program. Out of the 81,000 seniors and persons with disabilities who were eligible for the transition assistance provided by  the discount card, only 350 opted out of the  program. As a result of the discount card and  our delegation’s work to get this card to New  Jersey’s seniors, my state will save $90 million  on the cost of prescription drugs. These savings can be put back into the PAAD program  to provide expanded coverage  for additional  seniors. New Jersey is one example that I encourage more states to follow. By putting partisan politics aside, our delegation worked with  CMS to provide a simple process which benefits our state and our state’s seniors.  Defying logic, today and in the future, you  will hear members on  the other side of  the  aisle argue that the cost of prescription drugs  will increase as a result of the discount card.  For those members I would like to point to a  May 14th study by CMS which shows that in  the past week more cards have offered  increase discounts for our nation’s seniors compared  to prices offered  the previous week.  Sponsors are now comparing their discounts  to their competitors, more cards are offering  favorable prices, and CMS  is working with  card sponsors to make sure that the best discounts  are  published  for Medicare  beneficiaries. This is what happens when competition  is  injected  into  the marketplace. That’s  how markets work. Some on the other side of  the aisle would prefer a government run, command and control system where bureaucrats  or politicians tell people what medicines they  can have, how much they can have and when  and where they can have it. That sounds more  like the former Soviet Union to me.  Today you will also hear members who will  criticize the pharmaceutical industry for charging too much for prescription drugs. Yet they  will not mention  the miracle drugs or  treatments these companies create. Representing  the scientists and researchers who live in my  district of New Jersey, I would like to highlight  the good work that two of the pharmaceutical  companies are doing to help seniors. Once a  low-income beneficiary has exhausted his or  her annual $600 transitional assistance allowance, Merck and Johnson and Johnson will  provide its medicines free to that beneficiary’s  participating discount card plan or directly to  the beneficiary, through the pharmacy. Neither  company will receive any fees from these programs.  In closing, I encourage all members to put  aside partisan politics and help seniors recognize  the benefits of  the drug discount card.  This can be accomplished by working with  CMS to clarify any questions our seniors may  have and allowing seniors to realize the discounts that are available to all seniors through  the discount card.  f  NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS  WEEK  HON.

963,234,2004-05-21,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, this is National Small Business  Week; a  time  to  celebrate and  recognize  America’s small business entrepreneurs.  I honor our nation’s 23 million small businesses and recognize their vital contribution to  our nation. I want to especially thank my good  friend,  Congresswoman  from New York and applaud my House colleagues for their hard work on behalf of small  business. Additionally, I thank the many small  business owners for their numerous contributions.  Small business is the backbone of our state  and national economy. Unfortunately, many  small businesses are suffering in these trying  financial  times. Government  contracts  and  spending are a vital source of revenue, and  have become even more so during this current  economic slump. Small businesses lack high  powered  lobbyists,  therefore  it  is  imperative  that all levels of government continue to pay  diligent attention to small business in their purchasing and contracts. It is important that we  ensure that businesses of all sizes have access  to government contracts  regardless of  their ability to buy influence.  As Congress continues its work, I will dedicate myself to assuring that good news is on  the way for small businesses. Both our federal  and state government have an obligation  to  aid, assist and protect the interests of small  businesses. The future of America depends on  it.  I will continue  to strongly support  federal  programs that benefit small businesses.  OSTEOPOROSIS PREVENTION AND  AWARENESS MONTH  HON. SHELLEY BERKLEY  OFNEVADA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 2004  ",2004
964,234,2004-05-21,Ms.  BERKLEY.," Mr.  Speaker, May  is  Osteoporosis  Prevention  and  Awareness  Month. Osteoporosis and low bone density affects over 44 million Americans over the age  of 50, many of whom were unaware of their  risk for osteoporosis and were not able to take  steps  to prevent  it. While both men and  women are at-risk of developing osteoporosis,  women comprise 80 percent of those who develop the disease. Even though the risk of a  hip fracture for a woman is equal to her combined risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer, most adult women are unaware of the risk  factors for osteoporosis.  Like many Americans, I had no idea I was  at risk for developing osteoporosis. I believed  I simply had bad posture and was reluctant to  be screened for osteoporosis. Yet, as I was  running  for Congress  in 1998,  I was diagnosed with this disease.  Fortunately, within 10 months of treatment I  was able to stop my bone density loss and my  bones actually began to strengthen again. Because  of  my  personal  experience  with  osteoporosis,  I am  committed  to ensuring  Americans are aware of  the  importance of  strong  bones,  so  they  can  reduce  their  chances of developing the disease.  I commend the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) for their efforts to educate the  public during the month of May. This month,  the NOF has reached out to healthcare providers  and  consumers with  the message,  ‘‘Osteoporosis. Chances are . . . it could be  you.’’ Throughout the year, the NOF is dedicated  to promoting  lifelong bone health  in  order to reduce the prevalence of osteoporosis  and osteoporosis  related  fractures and  they  continue to work to find a cure for the disease  through  research, education, and advocacy.  For all those who have this disease and those  who may in the future, I will continue to work  with and support NOF’s efforts to raise awareness of the risk factors and ways to prevent  osteoporosis.  f  HONORING THE CREW OF THE USS  ‘‘PITTSBURGH’’ FOR THEIR HEROISM IN WORLD WAR II  HON.

970,8,2004-06-01,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  House Concurrent Resolution 417, introduced by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. PORTER). This resolution recognizes and honors the Tuskegee Airmen  for their contribution  in World  War II that led to the creation of an integrated United States Air Force.  The Tuskegee Airmen not only faced  the dangers of war but they did so in  the face of prejudice and discrimination back home. Prior to 1940, African  Americans were denied the opportunity  to fly military aircraft. However, after  pressure from civil rights organizations  and others, the Army Air Force began  a program to train African Americans  as  military  pilots.  The  so-called  ‘‘Tuskegee Experiment’’ began on July  19, 1941, at the Tuskegee Institute in  Alabama. The  institute,  founded by  Booker T. Washington in 1881, provided  the primary flight training for the first  fighter pilots and became the center of  African  American  aviation  during  World War II.  The Tuskegee Airmen included not  only fighter pilots but also navigators,  bombardiers, maintenance and support  personnel that provided support for the  famed 99th Fighter Squadron and the  332nd Fighter Group.  I think of one of my constituents,  Mr. Milton Crenshaw from Arkansas,  who was one of the pilot instructors. In  1939, he took a bus from Little Rock to  Tuskegee, a young, African American  man seeking a career in car engineering at the Tuskegee Institute only to  be drawn into the excitement of flight.  He became one of  the  few African  American pilot instructors in America  and taught numerous Tuskegee Airmen  of the 99th Fighter Wing how to fly.  The 99th Fighter Squadron, led by the  late General Ben Davis, was originally  sent to North Africa but moved to the  European  continent  and  flew  over  Anzio in 1944. The 99th held the record  of 200 combat missions without losing a  single bomber to enemy fire.  The men and women who were part of  the Tuskegee experience proved that  service, duty, and country were not  limited by the color of a person’s skin,  but that all Americans regardless of  race could succeed through hard work,  dedication,  and  commitment. While  their training occurred under a segregated condition, their focus was on  the goal of all pilots regardless of race:  avoidance of abrupt and surprising contact with Mother Earth.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
971,8,2004-06-01,Mr. COLE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for  me to request consideration of H. Con.  Res. 417 because this resolution honors  a remarkable group of African Americans who played a pivotal role in the  military history of our country. They  are not the only segregated unit to do  so, of course. The 54th Massachusetts  during the Civil War, the 9th and 10th  Buffalo Calvary, which were honored  with  the name Buffalo Soldiers by  their native American adversaries in  the latter part of the 19th century, a  group which constructed Fort Sill in  my own district and won lasting fame  there. And of course more recently, the  761st Tank Battalion whose exploits  have been chronicled in a fine volume  by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  But today, we are here to honor the  Tuskegee Airmen who with their professionalism, their skill, and courage  not only made an important contribution to  fighting tyranny during the  Second World War but also helped to  forge the United States Air Force into  the world’s dominant air and space  team.  On July 19, 1941, the Army Air Force  began a program in Alabama at the  Tuskegee  Institute  to  train African  Americans as military pilots. The primary flight training was conducted by  the Division of Aeronautics at the institute  founded by Booker T. Washington, and the transition to combat  aircraft  was  conducted  at  nearby  Tuskegee Army Airfield.  The first group of pilots completed  training 9 months later in March 1942.  Among that vanguard group was then-  Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., a future living legend in the Air Force who  went on to become one of its greatest  leaders. In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999, the  Congress authorized the President to  advance Lieutenant General Davis to  the grade of General on the retired list  of the United States Air Force.  That initial group of Tuskegee pilots  was assigned to the famous 99th Fighter Squadron, which was eventually deployed on May 31, 1943, to  fly P–40  Warhawks in combat missions in North  Africa, Sicily, and throughout Italy.  Later Tuskegee  graduates were  assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group and  began overseas combat operations in  Italy  flying  the  P–40  and  P–39  Airacobra.  Before the war ended, the Tuskegee  program had graduated 992 pilots and  450 Tuskegee Airmen had flown over  15,000  combat  sorties  overseas. Approximately 150 men had been killed  over the course of the program, with 66  killed in action. The combat record of  these  segregated  units was  superb.  They destroyed or damaged 136 enemy  aircraft in air-to-air combat and another 273 on the ground. They were  highly decorated with over 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses being awarded  to African American pilots.  The most impressive achievement of  the 332nd Fighter Group was  flying  over 200 bomber escort missions over  Central and Southern Europe without  losing a single bomber to enemy aircraft. This unprecedented record was  not lost on enemy fighter pilots who  often elected to avoid attacking bomber formations when they realized that  the  fighter escort was the Red Tail  fighters of the 332nd.  The  challenges  confronted by  the  Tuskegee Airmen were not limited to  the wartime skies over Europe. Each of  these men proudly met all challenges  with skill and determination when racism and bigotry had caused lesser men  to harass them and to seek their failure. There are a number of ways for  men to display courage in their lives,  but seldom are men confronted with as  many  tests of courage as were  the  Tuskegee Airmen; and very few men  can claim as successful and enduring a  legacy as they.  These combat pioneers distinguished  themselves throughout their service in  war and peace and over time redefined  America’s  understanding  of African  Americans as warriors and leaders and  set the stage for the racially integrated  Air Force that achieved so much in the  years to follow.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. PORTER) for  introducing this resolution. I feel very  fortunate to have had the opportunity  to address the House on this issue and  recognize  the  contributions  of  Tuskegee Airmen to America.

That was in his first  campaign he talks about the fact that  at one time when he came back from  the Navy and was going to be running  for office he thought that there was  going to be a discussion about issues  regarding taxes. He found out that, and  according to the article, the story was  that one of the biggest issues in East  Texas at that time was that they were  using dogs to hunt deer at that time  way back in the early 1960s. And they  got the  impression that Charlie was  against that, and they were extremely  angry with him and upset. So one of  the first things he talks about is going  to deliver a speech among 3,000 people  and bringing about five or six hounds  with him.  So he was and is a very colorful individual. I take pride in being the manager for this bill, and I ask for the  naming of the VA clinic in his name  and in his honor.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2004

A  fellow Texan, Charlie Wilson was educated at the U.S. Naval Academy and served  overseas as well as at the Pentagon. After retiring from the Navy in 1960 with the rank of  Lieutenant, he returned back to Lufkin and ran  successfully for the Texas Legislature, serving  in that capacity for twelve years.  In 1972, Charlie was elected as  the U.S.  Representative for the 2nd Congressional District of Texas and began has distinguished 24-  year career in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Naming  the Lufkin VA Clinic  in honor of  Congressman Wilson would be a fitting tribute  to such a devoted public servant.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, Senate Bill 1233, introduced by Senator BARBARAMIKULSKIof  Maryland and amended by the Committee on the Judiciary, authorizes assistance for the National Great Blacks  in Wax Museum and Justice Learning  Center located in Baltimore, Maryland.  Mr. Speaker, the Great Blacks  in  Wax Museum was founded in 1983 by  Doctors Elmer and Joanne Martin, two  Baltimore educators who used  their  personal savings to purchase wax figures which they displayed in schools,  churches, shopping malls, and festivals  in the mid-Atlantic region. The goal of  the Martins was to test public reaction  to the idea of a black history wax museum. So positive was  the  response  over time that the museum has been  heralded by the public and the media  as a national treasure.

For that reason, I had concerns  about the bill as reported by your Committee. My staff has had discussions with  staff for the sponsor of the companion House  measure, Rep. Cummings,  and we  have  reached a mutually agreeable compromise to  resolve these concerns. A copy of the compromise language is attached.  I understand that through staff discussions  you have indicated your willingness to take  the bill to the floor under suspension of the  rules and use the attached compromise language as the manager’s amendment when  you do so. I also understand that you will  use your best efforts to get the bill scheduled  for floor consideration as soon as you are  reasonably able  to  schedule  it with  the  House leadership.  Based on your willingness to follow this  course, I am willing to waive further consideration of the bill in the Committee on the  Judiciary so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the floor. The Committee on the  Judiciary takes this action with the understanding that the Committee’s jurisdiction  over the bill is in no way diminished or altered. I would appreciate your including this  letter and your response  in the Congressional Record during consideration of the  legislation on the House floor.  I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.  Sincerely,  F. JAMESSENSENBRENNER, JR.,  Chairman.  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  COMMITTEEONRESOURCES,  Washington, DC, March 25, 2004.  Hon. F. JAMESSENSENBRENNER, JR.,  Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your  letter regarding S. 1233, a bill to authorize  assistance for the National Great Blacks in  Wax Museum and Justice Learning Center. I  am delighted that you were able to negotiate  a suitable source and amount of funds for the  project.  The  Committee  on Resources will  be  pleased to take up your negotiated text on  the Floor when S. 1233 is considered by the  full House of Representatives. I also agree  that I will place your letter and this response in the Congressional Record to memorialize this agreement. Finally, I agree that  by allowing the Committee on the Judiciary  to be discharged from further consideration  of the measure, you have not waived or otherwise compromised your jurisdiction over  the subject matter of S. 1233.  Thank you for your cooperation on this  bill and for the good work of Joseph Gibson  of your staff. I look forward to other mutually beneficial dealings in the future.  Sincerely,  RICHARDW.

986,22,2004-06-01,Mr. RODRIGUEZ.," Mr. Speaker, the  Great Blacks  in Wax Museum  is a  unique education facility, well-deserving of the enormous support that it receives. The gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. CUMMINGS), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a sponsor of  the companion legislation here in the  House, and Senator MIKULSKIare to be  congratulated for their tireless efforts  on behalf of this facility and this important piece of legislation.  The museum expansion plans are ambitious, and I urge my colleagues to  support S. 1233 to help them on their  way.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2004

988,22,2004-06-01,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the National Great Black Americans Commemoration Act, an  important measure put  forth by Hon. ELIJAHCUMMINGSwhich gives  long overdue commemoration  to  the many  Black Americans who have served honorably  in this Nation.  By expanding the Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland, to establish the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum  and Justice Learning Center, Congress is acknowledging the monumental contributions of  African Americans who have served  in  the  Senate and House of Representatives; the judiciary and the field of law; various military engagements, including the Buffalo Soldiers and  Tuskegee Airmen; senior executive branch positions;  and  numerous  other  occupations  which have advanced the goals and causes of  the United States over the more than 400 year  history of people of African descent in America. The museum, which is currently visited by  more than 300,000 people annually, will employ the most skilled artisans in the wax medium  to  accurately  and  honorably  portray  those Black Americans who, with ability and  perseverance, have worked tirelessly for justice, equal rights, peace, and rule of law in our  great Nation.  The National Great Black Americans Commemoration Act is certainly worthy of support  by this body, particularly as it is a key complement  to  the National Museum of African  American History  and Culture Act,  championed by Hon. JOHNLEWISand signed into  law December 16, 2003. However, these gestures are but first steps in the directions of endowing esteemed Black Americans with  the  veneration that they deserve. More efforts like  this Act are needed if proper homage is to be  paid to those great Black pioneers who truly  laid the foundation upon which this Nation has  been built.  ",2004
989,22,2004-06-01,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of passage of  the National  Great Black Americans Commemoration Act of  2003, H.R. 2424 and S. 1233, companion legislation that I introduced along with my friend  Senator MUKULSKI. This bill has received bipartisan support in both committees of jurisdiction in the House, as well as bicameral support where it passed quickly to the floor out of  the Senate Judiciary Committee. I urge all of  my colleagues to vote in support of this measure and I urge the President to sign this important bill into law when it reaches his desk.  With valued input from Drs.

990,36,2004-06-01,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise with pride and pleasure  to recognize this June 1 as the first  time  in history that the seniors of  America have had the opportunity to  purchase a Medicare drug discount card  as the first step, but only the first step,  in reducing the cost of their prescription drugs.  My colleagues have heard a lot here  tonight. We have heard  some very  sharp things from the speaker who just  preceded me. But listen to this: this is  a widow in my hometown of New Britain who takes Zithromax; and because  of this discount card at a local pharmacy in New Britain, instead of paying  $46.50 for her Zithromax, she will now  pay $39.44. She takes Nystatin. Instead  of paying $35 for Nystatin, she will now  pay $15 for Nystatin. And so it goes.  One of the other drugs she takes costs  $40 and now will cost $11.50.  Mr. Speaker, this widow for whom  every dollar is precious will save $730  on her prescription drugs every year,  including this year. Now, that may not  be a lot to my colleagues, but for someone spending $2,000 on drugs a year, a  little over $2,000 on drugs a year, that  is a lot. That is 29 percent, almost 30  percent, of her drug costs.  So this is a good day for seniors, and  I and my colleagues are going to talk  about a lot of the things we have been  told  tonight about  this prescription  drug program. But we are here to say,  you be the judge. We are here to say,  do not let nay-sayers, do not let others  rob you of the hundreds of dollars of  savings on the prescription drugs on  which your health and well-being depend. You be the judge. You find out  the facts. You be the judge. It is real  simple.  But to start off tonight, let me turn  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. ENGLISH), a very good friend of  mine on the Committee on Ways and  Means.  ",2004
991,36,2004-06-01,Mr. ENGLISH.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to thank the gentlewoman. I want to  rise today not only to mark this historic day for Medicare beneficiaries because today, for the first time since the  program’s inception, Medicare, through  a discount card, will be providing real  relief to seniors who struggle to pay for  their prescription medicines.  I want to acknowledge that, but I  also want to especially acknowledge  the  efforts  of  the  gentlewoman  as  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on  Health for making this legislation possible. I am very proud to have been  part of the team that helped put this  legislation together and see it through  to the end; and I am also glad to be on  the floor tonight, having heard some of  the extraordinary claims from a number of Members who consistently voted  against prescription drug benefits for  seniors. They are now trying to run  down  the program  that we put  together, we fit into a budget, and we got  passed in the House. The record shows  that they did not offer a credible alternative, they did not offer a budget that  they could fit it into, and they were  talking a lot about seniors, but not delivering.  The discount card program that was  created under the Medicare reform bill  that we passed will also ultimately create a prescription drug program that  will be available by  2006  for every  Medicare  beneficiary. But what we  have done, which is so important, is  offer an  interim program to provide  immediate relief for seniors. Because I  know, as the gentlewoman found in her  district in Connecticut, in my district  in Pennsylvania, what seniors wanted  was some help that would be available  quickly. And when I brought the head  of CMS into my district for a town  meeting and he said it would take a  couple of years to ramp up a prescription drug program, they made it very  clear, that group of seniors in Mercer  County, Pennsylvania, they wanted to  see  something quicker, and  that  is  what we have been able to do.  These discount cards are meant to  provide a transitional program, especially for the approximately 10 million  Medicare beneficiaries who have no  drug coverage. Seniors have been enrolling in the numerous discount cards  in their area since May 3; and today,  many seniors will begin to enjoy savings on their medicines. CMS, the Center For Medicare and Medicaid Services which administers the Medicare  program, estimates that seniors will  save between $3.8 billion and $5.1 billion over the 2-year duration of the  program. This is a substantial amount  of money.  For an annual enrollment fee of no  more than $30, seniors will enjoy savings on drugs of up to 30 to 60 percent  on generic drugs, 16 to 30 percent or  more on usual retail prices, and 11.5 to  17 percent off average retail prices with  significantly larger discounts available  on mail order drugs. This is in real contrast with the message we have heard  from some of the critics. These are real  savings.  Even better, beneficiaries can choose  the card that gets them the  lowest  prices; and if they wish, they can also  get help finding low or no-fee cards,  cards that  include specific neighborhood pharmacies and/or cards from specific sponsors. But the important thing  is,  this  drug  card,  I  think  appropriately, provides additional assistance  to low-income seniors through a direct  subsidy. This is a big benefit to seniors  in my district.  Today, seniors with  limited means  are eligible  for a $600 annual credit  that goes a long way toward paying for  their medication. In my home State of  Pennsylvania, we have had a great program for low-income seniors called the  PACE program, which provides a prescription drug benefit for low-income  seniors who do not otherwise have such  a benefit. This has been, I think, the  hallmark of Pennsylvania State government  for many years and an extraordinary success for those who are  eligible.  With this new Medicare legislation,  the $600 credit will go directly to PACE  and allow them to automatically enroll  about 150,000 low-income seniors, lower  PACE’s costs, and allow PACE to waive  some $6 co-pays which low-income seniors would otherwise have had to pay  to get their medicines.  PACE beneficiaries will continue to  use the card PACE issues them to receive the benefits of the new program,  and seniors enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan like Security Blue in my  district will receive a drug discount  card from that plan.  Other eligible Pennsylvania seniors  can choose between 43 drug cards to  find the benefit that is best for them.  And as  I think the gentlewoman  is  about to point out, they have one number that they can call to get the information that they need.  Mr. Speaker, signing up for the drug  discount card and getting information  on the plans offered in their area could  not be easier. Seniors who want help in  selecting  a  card  should  call  1–800–  MEDICARE or visit the Medicare Web  site at www.medicare.gov; and there it  is, right there. There are 3,000 customer service representatives available  24 hours a day, 7 days a week to answer  these questions. To enroll  in a particular card, beneficiaries should contact that card and receive an application. There is a standard enrollment  form that will be accepted by all cards.  Mr. Speaker, what is interesting to  me is some politicians and special interest groups with their own narrow  agendas have run down the prescription drug benefit as ineffective. But I  VerDate May 21 2004  03:48 Jun 02, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01JN7.077 H01PT1 ",2004
992,43,2004-06-01,Mr. STRICKLAND.," Mr. Speaker, we  are told that these drugs will provide a  10 to 25 percent discount. There is no  guarantee of that, obviously. But we  are told that is likely to happen. But  here is what has happened. The drug  companies have raised their prices already. So  as  someone  said  earlier  today, it is like going to a used car lot  to buy a used car, and there is a sign on  the windshield which says reduced $300.  And the person buying the car does not  realize, although they are buying a car  that has a sign reduced $300, the day  before the car dealer had upped the  price by $400. That is what we are seeing here.  The drug companies have dramatically increased the cost of their drugs  over the  last year. Even AARP has  complained that drug companies have  upped  their price. Now  these cards  come along, and seniors are told you  are going to get a 10 to 25 percent discount, when the prices have already  gone up so far it has made any discount  meaningless.  I was here earlier, and I described  something that obviously made some  of my friends on the other side of the  aisle quite upset. My colleague from  Georgia was talking about the gentleman from Ohio, and I suppose he was  talking about me. The  fact  is I described what happened in this Chamber. They do not like to hear what happened in this Chamber, but the American people need to know. This over-  700-page bill was given to us on a Friday. We began to debate that afternoon  and evening, debated until 3 a.m. when  most normal Americans are asleep.  Now  there  is nothing wrong with  working late or throughout the night if  it is necessary; but there was no reason  for us to do it in the middle of the  night, no reason at all.

1035,78,2004-06-01,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, the  Senate  recently  confirmed  Debbie  Hersman to become a member of the  National Transportation Safety Board.  She has served the Commerce Committee for 5 years, and all of us will  miss her presence. We all wish her the  best in her new position and know that  she will serve with honor and integrity.  I ask unanimous consent that the following statements that are part of the  hearing record on her nomination be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  STATEMENTOFSENATORERNESTHOLLINGSON  THENOMINATIONOFDEBBIEHERSMAN  Mr. Chairman, I know Senator Hutchison  would agree that the most important character a member of the National Transportation Safety Board can have is independent  thinking. I don’t want someone going to an  accident, mind already made up, sharp elbows telling everybody what they are supposed to find, and everything like that.  What I want is someone who can look at  all sides of the issue. Someone who can challenge people to make the right decisions.  Someone who can manage the non-partisan  professionals doing the work. And someone,  who at the end of the day, will give a fair  and unvarnished response on what happened.  I pick NTSB members like George Bush  picks vice presidents. You can search the  country, far and wide, but the best of the  best in transportation safety, is right here in  the  room,  everyday  with  us,  Debbie  Hersman.  She has worked for the committee for almost 5 years. I’ve had her focus on rail, because of the tremendous needs we have to  modernize Amtrak and  improve passenger  and safety issues.  But she also has taken on oversight of  truck and bus safety, pipeline safety, hazardous materials transportation safety. And  post 9–11, I’ve asked her to oversee transportation security issues, insofar as air, rail,  ports, and trucking. In other words, she is  well-rounded in all aspects of transportation.  Her experience belies her youthful appearance.  Prior to joining our staff, Debbie was the  staff director for Congressman Bob Wise of  West Virginia, who served on key transportation and infrastructure committees. She  holds a bachelor’s degree from Virginia Tech  and a master’s degree from George Mason.  We still have much work to do on this  committee on transportation issues, and I  hate to lose my right arm. She is as hard a  worker, as smart as any, as competent a professional as any Senator could ask for. But I  know the country is better off, if Debbie is at  NTSB, and I proudly endorse her nomination.  ",2004
1036,78,2004-06-01,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  we hold many nomination hearings in  this  committee,  and we  say many  things about the nominees, usually in  praise of  them, but at  times questioning them. This nomination is a personal one for many of us, as we have all  watched Debbie work tirelessly on behalf of us and our constituents.  Before I discuss all of the reasons  that Debbie is absolutely the right person for this position, I want to proudly  state she is a West Virginian. Both of  her parents were raised in Roane County, WV.  In addition, she has many  proud relatives in Spencer and Charleston, WV. I know that the people of  West Virginia share my pride in all of  Debbie’s accomplishments.  Before coming to the Senate Commerce Committee, Debbie worked for  then Congressman Wise of West Virginia  in many  capacities,  including  chief of staff. Governor Wise called me  to  support her nomination, and we  wholeheartedly agreed that there was  no better person for the job. Debbie has  spent a career for the people of West  Virginia, and I know the entire country will benefit from her presence on  the National Transportation Safety  Board.  Each of us has had to call on the National Transportation Safety Board, or  watched on CNN, the work that they do  in sifting through a disaster site and in  dealing with family members following  an aviation tragedy. We rely on their  independence to provide Congress and  the transportation regulatory agencies  recommendations to improve safety. It  is a critical role that they play, and  one divorced  from politics and partisanship. The National Transportation  Safety Board  deals with  situations  where tragedies affect many people and  that makes it all the more important  that we select someone with both the  technical knowledge to contribute to  the board’s work and the human compassion needed in the context of these  tragedies. Debbie melds these two important requirements in a particularly  special manner.  Each Board member  is  an  independent source of knowledge and information. While the Board votes on matters, and we hope that all agree on the  safety  recommendations,  each  is  charged with independently making a  decision based on the facts and analysis of its expert staff. A small agency,  with some 429 employees, its expertise  and knowledge  is  recognized around  the world.  Debbie, who has worked on this committee for 5 years, has worked with all  of us on transportation safety and regulatory issues, using her expertise and  talents to push for improvements. Her  primary focus has been surface transportation, but  I know that she has  spent a considerable amount of time on  aviation safety issues, and helped with  aviation security matters following 9/  11. I know she worked on the highway  bill while a House staff member, and  that knowledge will help her in her  new position.  Her talents, wit, charm and expertise  will be sorely missed. I wish her the  best of luck in her new position, and  while none of us hope to see her about  a tragedy in our states, we know that  whatever the situation, the NTSB will  be in good hands with Debbie there.

1038,92,2004-06-01,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  as  Chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I have today introduced,  at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 2484, a proposed bill to  simplify and  improve pay provisions  for physicians and dentists, and to authorize alternate work schedules and  executive pay  for nurses. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted  this proposed legislation to the President of the Senate by letter dated July  18, 2003.  My introduction of this measure is in  keeping with the policy which I have  adopted of generally  introducing—so  that  there will be  specific bills  to  which my colleagues and others may  direct their attention and comments—  all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the Committee on  Veterans’ Affairs. In this case, I delayed introduction of this measure so  that certain provisions of the proposed  legislation, which proposes extensive  changes in the physician pay policies of  the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA), might be reviewed by the Committee’s staff, and by potentially-interested parties, prior to its introduction.  I am pleased to state that many constructive  ideas have been expressed,  and  the Committee’s  staff, working  with the VA, the National Association  of VA Physicians and Dentists, the  American Federation of Government  Employees, the National Federation of  Federal Employees,  and  other  representatives of VA’s labor force, have  identified prospective modifications to  the proposed bill’s text which, all appear  to agree, would  represent  improvements over the language of the  legislation forwarded to the Senate in  July 2003.  Even so, the bill I introduce today is  the bill which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs sent to the Committee in  July 2003. I have introduced that bill so  that the original ‘‘by request’’ legislation might be available to the Senate,  and to the public, as part of the public  record. As is always my policy with respect to any such ‘‘by request’’ legislation, I reserve the right to oppose the  provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this legislation. Indeed, as I  have indicated, the Committee’s staff,  with the assistance of VA and other interested parties, is already working on  modifications to the bill as proposed by  the administration.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD, together with the transmittal letter and a section-by-section  analysis which accompanied it.  There being no objection, the material  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  S. 2484  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department  of Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel  Enhancement Act of 2003’’.  SEC.  2. REFERENCES  TO  STATES CODE.  TITLE  38, UNITED  Except as otherwise expressly provided,  whenever in this Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a section or other provision, the reference shall  be considered to be made to a section or  other provision of title 38, United States  Code.  SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT AND SIMPLIFICATION OF  PAY PROVISIONS FOR PHYSICIANS  AND DENTISTS.  (a) Chapter 74 is amended—  (1) In section 7404(b)—  (A) by striking ‘‘(1)’’ after ‘‘(b)’’.  (B) by striking the list of position grades  in  lieu  inserting  under the caption, ‘‘PHYSICIAN AND DENTIST  SCHEDULE’’  and  thereof the following:  ‘‘Physician grade.  Dentist grade.’’  (C) by striking paragraph  tirety.  (2) In section 7404(c) by striking ‘‘special’’.  (3) By striking Subchapter III in its entirety and inserting in lieu thereof the following new sections:  Subchapter III—Pay for Physicians and  Dentists  (2)  in  its en§7431. Pay authority.  (a) In order to recruit and retain highly  qualified physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health Administration, the Secretary  shall establish and periodically adjust the  rates of pay  for physicians and dentists  based upon  the  factors  specified  in  subsection (b). Total pay shall be benchmarked  to representative salaries of non-Department  physicians, dentists, and health care clinician-executives.  (b) Pay for physicians and dentists employed in the Veterans Health Administration shall have three components:  (1) Base pay.—This shall be a uniform pay  band applicable nationwide. The minimum  rate shall be the maximum rate for Chief  grade in the Veterans Health Administration  Physician and Dentist Pay Schedule in effect  on the day before the date of enactment of  this Act. The maximum rate may not exceed  the rate of basic pay authorized by section  5316 of title 5 for Level V of the Executive  Schedule. The Secretary shall adjust annually the minimum rate by the same percentage as the adjustment under section 5303 of  title 5 in the rates of pay for the General  Schedule, and the maximum rate in accordance with section 5318 of title 5. Administration facilities, under regulations prescribed  by the Secretary, may set individual base  pay anywhere within the pay band.  (2) Market pay.—This shall be a variable  pay band based on geographic area, specialty, assignment, personal qualifications,  and individual experience, and shall be established and adjusted locally in accordance  with regulations prescribed under subsection  (c). Administration facilities will set individual market pay in accordance with regulations prescribed by  the Secretary. The  Under Secretary  for Health shall periodically review and recommend to the Secretary adjustments to the market pay band  based on published healthcare workforce employment and compensation data. The Secretary may adjust the market pay band periodically based on the recommendations of  the Under Secretary and  in  response  to  changing health-care labor trends.  (3) Performance pay.—  (A) There shall be a variable pay band  linked  to  the  physician’s  or  dentist’s  achievement of specific corporate goals and  individual  performance  objectives. Physicians and dentists other than those specified  in subsection (f)(1) shall not be eligible for  this component during the first year of appointment. The amount payable to a physician or dentist for this component may vary  based on individual achievement. The performance component paid to any physician  or dentist other than those specified in subsection (f)(1) will be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary and may  not exceed $10,000 in a year.  (B)  In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, ten percent of the  benchmarked total pay for physicians and  dentists specified in subsection (f)(1) shall be  linked  to  the  physician’s  or  dentist’s  achievement of specific corporate goals and  individual performance objectives as a performance component. Administration facilities may set the performance pay in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.  (c) Compensation paid under  this  subchapter shall be considered pay for all purposes, including but not limited to retirement benefits under chapters 83 and 84 of  title 5, United States Code, and other benefits. Notwithstanding  the  preceding  sentence, amounts paid  for performance pay  under subsection (b)(3)(A) shall not be considered pay  for retirement benefits under  chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States  Code.  (d) Any decrease in pay that results from  an adjustment to the market or performance  component of a physician’s or dentist’s total  compensation does not constitute an adverse  action.  (e) In no case may the total amount of  compensation paid to a physician or dentist  under this title in any one year exceed the  amount of annual compensation (excluding  expenses) specified in section 102 of title 3,  United States Code.  (f)(1) COVEREDPOSITIONS.—This subsection  applies to physicians and dentists in the following positions: Chiefs of Staff or equivalent facility-level and Network-level clinical  management positions  (including Network  Clinical Service Managers), facility and Network or Regional executive positions  (including Network Service Line Coordinators  and Medical Center/Health Care System Directors), Central Office executive positions,  and such other positions under this title as  the Secretary may determine in accordance  with regulations prescribed  in accordance  with section 7434(a).  (2) Notwithstanding the special relationships of the Veterans Health Administration  with affiliated  institutions under  section  7302, physicians and dentists serving in covered positions and receiving compensation  under this subchapter may not receive any  compensation on or after the date specified  in  regulations  issued  by  the Secretary,  through employment or contract with, or negotiate or accept any offer of employment  from, any institution or other entity that is  affiliated with the VA medical center to  which they are assigned, or affiliated with a  VA medical center which falls under their official responsibilities. This limitation shall  include receiving compensation through or  from practice groups or any other entities  associated with the affiliated institution(s),  or from entities under contract with the affiliated  institution(s).  Compensation  includes anything of monetary value, including but not limited to honoraria, salary, and  any fringe benefits such as: tuition waiver,  insurance protection, contributions to a retirement  fund, payment  for books, below-  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:39 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S01JN4.REC S01JN4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

For his Eagle  Scout project, James organized a project  to  teach tree pruning techniques to other Scouts  and  Leaders  and  then  pruned  the  trees  around the four mile walking trail in Kearney,  Missouri.  James will be serving the United States of  America by enlisting in the Marine Corps and  will be leaving by the end of this month for his  induction.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending James Parker Southworth for his  accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts  of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

It is a fabric of patriotic Americans who  work hard, respect their neighbors, and stand  proud for this nation. It is a fabric of families  that heaps admiration on  the  fathers and  mothers and  the sons and daughters who  serve in our Armed Forces with selfless dedication. And it is this same fabric of families  who sacrifice so much for this country.  Our soldiers stand resolved to protect our  families and our children from danger and attack.

1042,3,2004-06-09,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, what  distinguished President Reagan among  American Presidents in the last century? Where many Chief Executives  saw gray and moral relativism on the  international landscape, he saw good  and evil, right and wrong.  What relationship should we in the  United States have with the Soviet  Union, a tyranny that trampled freedom,  starved  its people,  imprisoned  dissidents,  choked  its  economy and  wrapped its tentacles around its neighbors? Do we engage them? Do we fight  them in one corner of the world while  doing business with them in the other?  Can we coexist under  the constant  threat of mutual destruction and endless arms races? Do we practice detente, containment?  Ronald Reagan was  the President  who said, Americans cannot live like  this, and I do not think the world’s  other citizens should. The day he stood  at the Berlin Wall and defiantly challenged the Soviet tyranny with the unforgettable words, Mr. Gorbachev, tear  down this wall, was the beginning of  the end of the Cold War. God bless  President Reagan.  f  PROGRESS IN THE FREEDOM OF  IRAQ  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1043,3,2004-06-09,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the  midst of our national loss, gain. In the  progress  of  freedom  in  Iraq,  after  months of sacrifice by U.S. and coalition forces, yesterday the United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to a resolution outlining a free  and democratic future for the people of  Iraq.  By a 15 to 0 vote, which included  France, Germany  and Russia,  the  United Nations agreed to declare a formal end to occupation on June 30 and  set into motion the process of an interim and permanent democracy  in  Iraq.  Make  no mistake  about  it, Mr.  Speaker, international approval of the  progress of freedom in Iraq is a victory  for this President and, I would add, a  fitting  tribute  to  the President  in  whose memory we will gather  later  today.  f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT  RONALD WILSON REAGAN  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1044,3,2004-06-09,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  this morning with  so many of my  friends to pay tribute to the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan, and to extend my condolences to his wife Nancy and to his  family.  President Reagan will always be remembered as the architect of policies  that ended the Cold War, peace through  strength. He more than anyone else  was directly responsible for giving us  the possibility of a world that could  live in peace. He ended the Cold War.  He ended the threat of hostilities between the United States and Russia,  and he brought an end to the Soviet  domination in Eastern Europe.  He unleashed the power of the American economy. Yes, it cost money to  defeat the Soviet Union. It cost money  to defeat Soviet tyranny, but in the  long run, was it worth it? You bet it  was, for this generation and for the  generations to come.  f  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS  AN INSPIRATION  (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1045,3,2004-06-09,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, President  Ronald Reagan was an inspiration to  me and millions of others throughout  the U.S. and even all over the world.  He saw the American dream come true  in his life, rising from humble beginnings and achieving great, great success in almost every way.  He will certainly go down in history  as one of our greatest Presidents, but  his greatness may have been achieved  in large part because, as one of his  closest friends said a couple of days  ago, he did not worry about how history would view him.  It has been said his greatest legacy  will be leading us to victory in the Cold  War, but his domestic achievements  were great, too, especially in lowering  taxes and helping curb the greed of  government.  I had the privilege of meeting President Reagan on many occasions, starting when he was Governor of California. He was always so kind to me  and to everyone, and possibly one of  his greatest attributes may have been  in showing us that you can have strong  views on  important  issues, but still  treat opponents with kindness, compassion and even good humor.  We are all better people, Mr. Speaker, because of the life and example of  President Ronald Reagan.  f  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS  LIVING PROOF THAT IDEAS WIN  BATTLES  (Mr. EHLERS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1046,3,2004-06-09,Mr. EHLERS.," Mr. Speaker, for many  years I have heard comments about the  power of ideas. I learned as a youngster  that the pen is mightier than the sword  and that there is nothing so powerful  as an idea whose time has come. President Ronald Reagan demonstrated that  these and similar statements, are true.  He was living proof that ideas win battles.  He was not regarded as an intellectual, but yet he understood the importance of the basic, simple ideas that  this country is founded upon, the ideas  of peace and freedom, freedom to worship, freedom to speak, freedom of the  press, but he also went beyond that. He  recognized that these are not ends in  themselves, but these are means to an  end, and freedom to worship is meaningless unless you use it to worship.  Freedom of the press is meaningless  unless you use it to print ideas that are  for the betterment of the Nation.  Simple  ideas, valiantly  fought  for.  With grace, charm and a twinkle in his  eye, he succeeded where others had  failed. He inspired a troubled Nation.  He brought us together. He conquered  the symbolic Iron Curtain and brought  it down, along with the very real Berlin Wall. He  led  to nuclear  disarmament, the greatest threat to humanity during his tenure.  I  rise  today  to  thank President  Reagan for what he did for this country, for the ideas he fought for and the  transformation he made in the culture  and the attitudes of this Nation.  f  RONALD REAGAN DEFINED THE  AMERICAN DREAM  (Mr. SHUSTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

1047,3,2004-06-09,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, we rise  today with solemn hearts for the loss  of an American hero, a man with an optimistic vision of this country that was  infectious. I stand as an individual who  felt the energy of the Reagan era.  As a 19-year-old in 1980, I attended  my first Republican convention where  Ronald Reagan accepted the GOP nomination for President. My first vote for  President was for Ronald Reagan, and I  spent the beginning of adulthood under  the spirit of a man who defined the  American dream.

1049,10,2004-06-09,Mr.  RADANOVICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I rise in support of the resolution  paying  tribute  to President Ronald  Reagan who once said, ‘‘America is too  great  for  small  dreams.’’ Whether  through his faith in God’s providence,  his deep love for his wife, Nancy, his  career as an actor, his service as Governor of the State of California and ultimately as our Commander in Chief,  President Ronald Reagan envisioned  and achieved big dreams. These dreams  included lowering the tax burden on  citizens through his advocacy of smaller government and striving for peace in  the tenuous times of the Cold War.  As a boy in the fourth grade, I had  the honor of  shaking Mr. Reagan’s  hand at the Mariposa airport when he  was on his way to Yosemite after he  became the Governor of the great State  of California. He  is the very reason  that I later became a Republican and  devoted my life to public service.  President Reagan died on the very  weekend of the commemoration of D-  Day where just 20 years ago he heralded the heroes that lay before him in  Normandy as those who ‘‘helped end a  war.’’ Fittingly, we now herald this  American  hero  for  his  unmatched  achievements,  including  ending  the  Cold War. History will forever remember him for removing this threat of nuclear holocaust.  There are good men in the world, and  there are great men. Great men employ  their power humbly and create peace  quietly. President Reagan  embodied  these traits and reminded us to believe  in ourselves as the greatest country in  the world.  ",2004

1052,10,2004-06-09,Mr. NORWOOD.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from California for yielding me  this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the floor today  to join my colleagues and the legions  of Americans and freedom-loving people around the world in honoring the  memory and the legacy of President  Ronald Wilson Reagan.  In  the days  that  have  passed  since  President  Reagan slipped the surly bonds of this  world, much has been said about our  Nation’s 40th President, of his boundless energy, eternal optimism, strong  character, good  judgment and, most  important of all, his unmatched ability  to lead and to deliver hope to America  and the world at a time when it was  needed most. Despite those who would  suggest  otherwise,  the  accomplishments and good fortune that befell this  Nation and ultimately those behind the  Iron Curtain on President Reagan’s  watch did not happen accidentally or  through luck or simply being in the  right place at the right time.  b1115  No, Mr. Speaker. Providing unfailing  hope and guidance to a grateful Nation  and all the world in a time of much despair is not luck. It is called leadership. And President Reagan will be remembered as a leader without peer, period.  Winston Churchill once said,  ‘‘The  price of greatness  is responsibility.’’  President Reagan understood and accepted that responsibility like no one  else, and he left greatness in his wake.  Mr. Speaker, if the measure of a man  is the difference that he makes, then  history will record that President Ronald Reagan was nothing less than a  giant. He will be missed, but his legacy  of leadership will live on in the history  of this Nation.  ",2004

1054,10,2004-06-09,Mr. COX.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana  (Mr. PENCE), a distinguished Member of  this body, a true Reaganite.  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1055,10,2004-06-09,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman, my favorite Reagan protege  in the Congress, for yielding me this  time.  Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan will be  remembered as a great man and a great  American leader, who personified the  highest ideals of the American people  at home and abroad. After 8 years of  his Presidency, the communism of Soviet Russia was collapsing, the American military was rebuilt, the Nation’s  economy restored, and its moral fabric  renewed.  Many remember him as the ‘‘Great  Communicator,’’ but as the President  said many times, he was not a great  communicator, he communicated great  things. Those were  the  traditional  American values of this Midwesterner  turned  national  leader. They  came  from the profound Christian faith inculcated in a young Dutch Reagan by  his beloved mother Nelle and from his  heart. And,  as  the President  said,  ‘‘They came from the heart of a great  Nation.’’  Those  ideas were simple, straightforward,  and  distinctly  American.  President Reagan believed that  freedom depended on limited government.  He fiercely advanced the principles of  less government, less taxes, a strong  military, and a commitment to traditional moral values.  And President Reagan changed the  course of my life. While youthful ambition led me to politics, it was the voice  and the values of Ronald Reagan that  made me a Republican. The Bible says,  ‘‘If the trumpet does not sound a clear  call, who will get ready for battle?’’  Ronald Reagan’s  great  gift was  to  sound a clear call to return our Nation  to the ideals of its Founders, and it was  said that when he spoke, people just  did not just agree. From coffee shops to  tractor seats to high offices  in tall  buildings, when the American people  heard Reagan speak, they said, ‘‘Darn  right.’’  I had the privilege in 1988 as a candidate  for Congress to sit with the  President  in the Blue Room of the  White House and speak to him personally, and on that occasion, that great  privilege of my life, I was able to look  the President in the eye as he asked me  how my campaign was going. I said,  ‘‘Mr. President, it is going fine, but I  just want to thank you for everything  you have done for our country and to  encourage my generation of Americans  to believe in this country again.’’  I said then, and I say again, thank  you, Mr. President. May God bless you,  as, through you, God most certainly  blessed the United States of America.

1057,17,2004-06-09,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, today our  Nation weeps in a very sad week when  we recognize that we have lost a President who changed the Nation and acted  upon a policy  that created positive  change not only for this Nation, but for  the entire world.  Those of us who went into politics in  the 1980s, as I did, many of us went in  because we were  inspired by Ronald  Reagan. I actually ran for office the  first time in 1980, and something that I  will never forget is that Ronald Reagan  took the time for a young, just-getting-started fellow who is running for  the State representative in Texas, to  drop me a personal note of encouragement. Here was a man who was going  to lead the Nation, and yet he took the  time for one small elected official. I  will never forget that.  Ronald Reagan believed in America.  He knew America to be the most noble  Nation on the face of the Earth, and he  absolutely trusted the American people, that they would do the right thing,  because he knew them to be the noble  people who created this Nation. That  message, as he  inspired our country  with that message, brought us out of  malaise and started us on the path of  glory to know that we are doing the  right thing.  We have missed Ronald Reagan. We  will miss him tremendously because he  inspired us to the greatness that we  have, and for that reason, he has been  a blessing upon this Nation. We will  not forget.  Back in Williamson County, where I  come from, we celebrate Ronald Reagan’s birthday every year, and that is  our big birthday celebration because  we know Ronald Reagan is the modern  founder of the Republican Party today,  and that inspiration causes us to celebrate his birthday.  Our thoughts and prayers are with  his family, and we hope that they get  through this with not too much crisis  for all  the blessings  they have bestowed upon our Nation.  ",2004

1059,17,2004-06-09,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today with a heavy heart to honor one  of America’s greatest statesmen, President Ronald Reagan.  As Ronald Reagan makes his final  trip to Washington, we remember this  truly humble American hero. We remember a man with an ordinary beginning who went on to do extraordinary  things, to chart the course for a generation, for a Nation and for the world.  Mr. Speaker, Washington is a town of  leaders, and each of us who comes to  Washington has a vision for the direction of our Nation. Rarely is there a  man like Ronald Reagan who cannot  only lead leaders, but who can do so  with such integrity, principle and honesty.  In the midst of a Nation whose spirit  had been crushed with war and economic burden, in the midst of people  gripped with fear from the spread of  communism, Ronald Reagan picked us  up and breathed hope into our hearts.  He reminded us of what we were fighting for. He said, ‘‘The ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on  for the world will not be bombs and  rockets but a test of wills and ideas, a  trial of spiritual resolve: the values we  hold, the beliefs we cherish and the  ideals to which we are dedicated.’’  He reminded us that as Americans we  have a responsibility to help those in  need:  ‘‘We  cannot  turn  away  from  them,’’ he said, ‘‘for the struggle here  is not right versus  left;  it  is right  versus wrong.’’ How true his words still  ring today.  Ronald Reagan reminded us that government is not the answer to our problems, people are.  ‘‘The government’s  view of the economy could be summed  up in a few short phrases,’’ he said. ‘‘If  it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving,  regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.’’  By exposing and destroying burdensome and oppressive  regulation and  taxes, he restored the spirit that America’s built upon: optimism, opportunity  and self-reliance. In doing so, he not  only energized the economy, but he rejuvenated the pride and self-worth of  Americans.  Finally, Ronald Reagan reminded us  of the importance of faith in our democracy. He said, ‘‘Freedom prospers  when religion is vibrant and the rule of  law under God is acknowledged.’’ He  will be missed, but his words and spirit  will continue on.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.  Mr.  Speaker,  President  Reagan  changed our hearts with his optimistic  outlook on life, the world and our place  in it. He came to office at a time in our  history when we were a little bruised  and  battered,  and,  simply  said, he  pulled us up by our bootstraps and  taught us how to get back on the horse  that knocked us off.  ‘‘America  is  too  great  for  small  dreams,’’ he once said, but to Ronald  Reagan these were not merely words  that were used in a 30-second sound  bite. These were words that went to the  core of the man.  He reminded us that even though we  may have our differences, our common  bond as Americans sets us apart from  the rest of the world. He believed in all  that is good in America because he believed there is good in every American.  Ronald Reagan was a hero to me and  a hero  to an entire generation. He  leaves a legacy of hope and prosperity  that will last for generations to come.  I know there is a special place in  heaven for Ronald Reagan, and I know  in my heart he heard the words, ‘‘Well  done.’’  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. COX) for  the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  man who I believe to be the greatest  American President of the 20th century. President Ronald Reagan  defeated  the most powerful and dangerous military empire in the history  of the world without  firing a single  shot. President Reagan knew instinctively that America represents good,  and he knew  that communism  represents evil. He never wavered in his  conviction that freedom is the birthright of all mankind.  The enemies of the United States  never forgave him for his firmness, for  his character, for his faith in the people of the United States and his faith  in the cause of liberty. Even in his  death, they continue to attack him.  His hatred is evidenced by the declaration made by the tyrannical regime in  Havana a  few hours ago:  ‘‘He, who  never should have been born, has died.’’  That monstrous statement illustrates  the ultimate evil of the tyrant who has  enslaved the Cuban people for over 45  years. President Reagan knew that the  Cuban tyrant and that Communist tyrants everywhere have represented and  represent  the  antithesis  of  liberty,  freedom and human dignity.  I think he was an extraordinary leader, Mr. Speaker, someone who inspired  us all, changed America for the better  and saved the world from tyranny.  May Ronald Wilson Reagan, apostle  of  freedom,  democracy  and  human  rights, rest in peace.  b1215  ",2004

1064,24,2004-06-09,Mr. MCNULTY.," Madam  Speaker,  President Reagan’s long struggle with  Alzheimer’s disease has ended, but the  legacy of his extraordinary  life  remains.  In 1998, my mother died as a result of  the impact of Alzheimer’s disease; so I  know what families go through during  times like that. And I will always be  inspired by Nancy Reagan and  the  other members of the family for their  tender caregiving to the former President over that very long period of time.  Many people today have mentioned  the occasion of the tearing down of the  Berlin Wall by the people, and I recently looked at those pictures of the  former President when he participated  in chipping away at the wall. I was on  the Committee on Armed Services at  the time, and I had a chance to do that,  too. As I was standing there watching  people chipping away at the wall, tearing it down piece by piece, I noticed as  the pieces were  falling off the wall,  some of them would catch the pieces  and put them in their pockets. I said to  myself, aha, they are taking souvenirs  of the Berlin Wall, and I thought I  might like to do that.  And already capitalism being in evidence, I looked down, and there were  vendors selling pieces of the wall. They  were  in  little  cellophane wrappers  marked with the date they were taken  off the wall. But ever the skeptic, I  said to myself, how do I know that  those pieces came off the wall?  So I further looked around, and I saw  this guy walking back and forth with  hammers and  chisels,  renting  them  out. So I went over with my translator  and made the deal and gave him some  money,  and  I  did what President  Reagan did, and I chipped off some  pieces of the wall. I brought them back  home, and I gave them to veterans as a  thank you to them for their dedication  through the years and for the fact that  they were responsible  for what was  happening on that particular day and  at that particular time in history.  President Reagan was a proud and  patriotic American whose persistent  advocacy for democracy led in part to  the breakup of the Soviet Union and its  devolution  into  15  individual democratic republics. And I was in one of  those republics as a member of a delegation  from Congress on their  independence  day.  In Armenia,  and  I  watched in awe as 95 percent of all of  the people in that country went out  and voted. I watched them stand in  long lines for the privilege of voting in  a free election for the first time in  their lives. I noticed they brought covered dishes with them, and after they  voted, they held little celebrations and  banquets in each of the polling places.  And what a thrill it was to be with  them the next day in the streets of  Yerevan, their capital, as they danced  and  shouted and  sang,  ‘‘Ketze asat  ankakh  Hayastan,’’  which  means  ‘‘Long live free and independent Armenia.’’ Then they pointed to the United  States of America as their example of  what they wanted to be as a democracy.  So I thank all of the men and women  who  served  in  the uniform  of  the  United States military  through  the  years for helping to make that happen,  and I also thank the Commander-in-  Chief for 8 years, Ronald Reagan, for  helping to make that happen.  Today I join with all Americans in  mourning his passing and in expressing  deep gratitude for his tremendous public service as both Governor and as  President.  ",2004

Madam Speaker, I rise to proudly pay  tribute to the greatest President of the  20th century, Ronald Wilson Reagan,  whose suffering has ended and heavenly  life begun.  My  fellow Minnesotans  join me  in  mourning the loss of America’s 40th  President and celebrating the life of a  man who personified both the greatness  and  goodness  of America. All  Americans and freedom-loving people  around  the  world  owe  President  Reagan our deepest gratitude for his  strong,  principled  leadership  that  ended the Cold War and brought freedom to millions of people.  As we celebrate President Reagan’s  remarkable career and historic legacy,  we also celebrate a man of strong character, deep conviction, unforgettable  charm, and wonderful wit. No Minnesotan will ever forget President Reagan  braving  the below-zero windchill  to  ride in a convertible in St. Paul’s Winter Carnival Parade and proclaim, ‘‘I  thought my ears would fall off.’’ It was  that cold.  Madam Speaker, as America honors  our beloved 40th President, we also  thank God for a leader who restored  pride and made the American people  believe  in themselves again. Always  the eternal optimist, President Reagan  instilled confidence and optimism at a  time both were in short supply in our  country.  Thanks to President Reagan’s strong  leadership and undying belief in free-  market capitalism, the great entrepreneurial spirit of the American people  was unleashed, and prosperity was restored here at home.  Madam Speaker, our hearts go out to  Nancy Reagan and the Reagan family  on their great loss. Mrs. Reagan has  showed the whole world the true meaning of love and loyalty these past 10  very painful years as her beloved husband suffered from cruel Alzheimer’s  disease, the same deadly, debilitating  disease that took the life of my own  mother just months ago.  So today, Madam Speaker, as we celebrate the life and legacy of Ronald  Reagan, let us honor this great President by keeping his legacy alive, a legacy  of  love  for  his  faith,  family,  VerDate May 21 2004  00:58 Jun 10, 2004 Jkt 29060 PO 00000 Frm 000024 Fmt 04634 Sfmt 00634 E:\CR\FM\K09JN7.051 H09PT1 ",2004

1069,31,2004-06-09,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. Speaker, once or  twice a century we are given a President who stands above the rest. President Reagan was such a  leader. He  united this country in a way that we  have not been united since. He did so  by simply speaking out for what the  vast majority of the people of this  country knew to be the truth: President Reagan declared that there is a  God and that we, as a Nation, are under  his authority.  Like President Washington  before  him, he made no apology to anyone’s  sensibilities. He called the Evil Empire  of communism exactly what it was and  committed this Nation to defeating it.  He was the first President to begin the  battle to reverse the overreach of Federal bureaucracy in the lives of our  citizens.  Let us truly honor the memory of  Ronald Reagan by never ending the  fight he so nobly waged for God and for  country.  ",2004

1073,31,2004-06-09,Mr. HOSTETTLER.," Mr. Speaker, on  behalf  of  the  citizens  of  Indiana’s  Eighth Congressional District, I rise  not only to pay tribute to Ronald Wilson Reagan but to also thank him for a  Commander in Chief we could always  be proud of.  The most  important  role  of  any  American President  is that of Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces;  and I, for one, do not need to wait for  history to conclude that he was one of  the greatest Commanders in Chief this  Nation has ever had.  Last year, my son Matthew and I  were honored to attend the commissioning of the newest U.S. Super Carrier, CVN–76. I could not think of a better namesake for CVN–76 than Ronald  Wilson Reagan. The ship’s motto is appropriately,  ‘‘Peace  Through  Strength.’’ While he  is  rejoicing  in  heaven, the American people should  feel comforted in knowing that his legacy lives on in a mighty U.S. warship  that bears his name and will provide  firepower for freedom for another 50  years.  So Communists and terrorists and  other enemies of  freedom, you have  been forewarned. You have not heard  the last from Ronald Reagan. And as  he used to say when he was President,  ‘‘You can run, but you cannot hide.’’  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, may the  prayers and thoughts of a loving free  world comfort his wife, Nancy, and  their children during their time of supreme sorrow and unimaginable loss.  ",2004
1074,31,2004-06-09,Mr. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is truly unfortunate that it takes a time of crisis or  tragedy to bring our Nation together.  This week, for example, we have seen  and heard from Members of both sides  of the aisle a tribute to a great President, Ronald Reagan. He was a humble  man; he was a gracious man and kind.  We may have had differences of opinion  on policy, but I think we all concede he  was a good, good, decent man.  I never presume to speak  for my  friends on the other side of the aisle,  but I think all of us would agree that  we have the greatest Nation  in the  whole world, and one of the things that  makes us so great as a Nation are the  personal liberties and individual freedoms that we all share here in this  country. The Bill of Rights of our Constitution gives us more economic and  personal freedoms than people almost  anywhere in the world, and we are a  better Nation  for that. And I think  that  is  something Ronald Reagan  would say if he were here right now.  I think we can learn a lot of important things, and a lot of speakers on  both sides of the aisle have annunciated some of those things this morning. We should try harder to disagree  without being disagreeable. We should  always treat each other with respect.  And we should understand that we are  all Americans and we are all in this together. We all want basically the same  thing for our country and for our people.  If we can do that, I think we are  going to be better as a Nation and  stronger as a people. We need to find  ways to bring us together and not to  divide us. I think 85 to 90 percent of the  people in this body are good, decent,  honorable people who want to do the  right thing  for our country, Republicans and Democrats.  We need  to understand  that even  when we have honest good-faith differences on policy issues, such as the $7  trillion debt we have right now, and  the $500-plus billion deficit, this should  not be about Republicans and Democrats; this should be about what  is  right for our country, and this should  be about what is right for our children  and our grandchildren and future generations in this country.  I hope that we will take this occasion, the passing of a great President,  Ronald Reagan, to come together and  again dedicate ourselves to doing what  is right for our country and putting  aside partisan politics.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add  my voice to the chorus extolling the  life of President Ronald Reagan. On a  similar occasion, over a century ago,  Lincoln said of Washington, ‘‘How do  you add glory to the sun?’’  I was at President Reagan’s  inauguration, and when he said, ‘‘It is time  for us to realize that we are too great  a Nation to limit ourselves to small  dreams,’’ my spine stiffened, and so did  that of so many people in the crowd. I  got goosebumps when he called out  that ‘‘peace is the highest aspiration of  the American people. We will negotiate  for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever.’’  From that day on, I knew America  was back. You see, many people speak  of the Reagan Revolution. I  like to  think of it as the Reagan restoration.  Reagan restored our optimism, our belief in our ability to create, and the belief that God put man on this Earth to  be free and that he made America to  prove it.  President Ronald Reagan  changed  the paradigm. He changed America’s  foreign policy from one of benign containment to active confrontation. And  for the  first time since communism  began extending its sinister reach, we  saw its hand pushed back.  Our sympathies certainly go to the  entire Reagan family.  ",2004

And though I am certain that the human race will survive;  for a Nation to survive these challenges, each generation must continually produce men and women who are  sufficient to the moment and equal to  the task. It needs to generate men and  women who see without  limits, who  work without tiring, and who sacrifice  without restraint. A nation must find  within itself in these times of trouble  those who will forego comfort and give  up the beaten paths of certainty to find  new courses of action and overcome all  obstacles  in pursuing the truth. Mr.  Reagan was sufficient for the moment  and equal to the task.

1080,38,2004-06-09,Mr. SCHROCK.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor and  remember a great man, a great  leader and a great President.  Ronald Wilson Reagan is a man none of us  will soon forget. In the annals of American and  world history, Ronald Reagan will be recognized and remembered with the great leaders  of our past  like Winston Churchill, George  Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  As a principled leader, he challenged political leaders in our Nation, in both parties, to  go beyond the status quo, to think beyond the  realms of the possible, to reach new heights  in public discourse by doing more than debate  the problems ailing the American people, and  to actually find a solution.  He actively worked  to enact new policies  that brought our Nation out of the malaise of  the 1970’s.  He fought communism and tyranny, bringing  freedom to more people in the world than has  ever been achieved in history.  His principle of, ‘‘Peace through strength,’’  not only  led our Nation  to become  the preeminent superpower in the world, but it also  brought the Soviet empire down to its knees,  ending the Cold War once and for all.  When was  the  last  time we have seen a  world leader stand boldly on the doorsteps of  an enemy and challenge him to ‘‘Tear down  this wall’’? President Reagan knew what had  to be done and he did it. Why? Because it  was the right thing to do.  I think most Americans will remember Ronald Reagan for the inspiration he gave us all.  He helped us to believe in ourselves again.  After our failed efforts in Vietnam and the protests and marches against our actions there,  after Watergate, after economic malaise, and  after the Iran Hostage Crisis, America was in  a state of despair with very little hope in the  future.  But President Reagan helped us to believe  we could be better, and became better. He  showed us America could be strong and win  the Cold War, and we became strong and won  it. He promised us he would  invest  in  the  American people to turn the economy around.  He made  that  investment and dividends are  still paying off today.  President Reagan optimistically led the way.  The Nation followed and we are better off because of it.  In spite of all that President Reagan did for  our Nation, the one thing that speaks volumes  about his character and the man that he was,  was the way he loved Nancy. He was not embarrassed about his  love  for her,  rather he  demonstrated it at every opportunity.  President Reagan was committed  to his  family, to his Nation and to the world. He was  dedicated  to his  integrity, principles and  the  belief that America could become that shining  city on a hill.  Today, we say goodbye to this great man,  leader, President  and  husband. We miss  President Reagan. May God bless him and his  family.  ",2004
1081,38,2004-06-09,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Speaker, my memories of  Ronald Reagan are much like the memories of  so many of those who met President Reagan  and who were absolutely charmed by him.  Ronald Reagan wasn’t just called the ‘‘Great  Communicator’’ because he could give good  speeches; he was a brilliant communicator on  all  levels. He understood how  the everyday  person on the street understood issues, and  he framed things in such a way that people  believed him. He presented his ideas simply  and eloquently.  He was also excellent one-on-one. His Irish  charm was all encompassing. That  charm  made him an agreeable opponent when we  disagreed on issues. He welcomed opposition  on a matter; he understood  that democratic  societies only flourish when both sides of an  issue are clearly heard. He relished debate.  President Reagan’s acting career was helpful to him in his political career, although his  detractors often denigrated him for it. But he  was a good actor; his performance in Kings  Row was widely hailed. But World War II intervened and his advancing career was diverted  to military service, making movies  for  the  troops.  My personal memories of  the President  were times we saw each other in the White  House or the Capitol. The first time we met,  my 10-year-old daughter, Yvette, accompanied  me to the White House party for new Members of Congress. After being rebuffed by a  security guard when she asked if she could  get Reagan’s autograph, the President found  out and obliged her with his autograph.  I remember another meeting with him that  was  rather high stakes on  the  international  stage. I’d just returned from El Salvador in the  mid 1980s with a CODEL of House Members  where we’d sought to bring back good information about  the  rebel uprisings  in Central  America, particularly there in El Salvador.  Talking about—and debating at points during the conversation—international policy with  the President of the United States in the Oval  Office was a heady moment. We marveled  that a migrant worker from Robstown and a  lifeguard  from  Illinois would wind up  in  this  room, talking about such important things.  He loved this Nation and felt a great responsibility to it. When his tax cuts and economic  policies produced mountains of massive deficit, he stepped up and reversed his policy,  raising taxes higher than any president before  him—or since—has ever done. His insistence  that the Soviets tear down the Berlin Wall rang  truer than anyone would have believed at the  time.  He had a sweet soul. This was one of the  central tenets of the man. He loved his wife  deeply, and  the entire Nation has come  to  love her even more after they left the White  House. Nancy Reagan’s monumental strength  in the face of facing her dear husband’s illness, without him entirely with her, might have  broken lesser people.  One of the President’s greatest contributions  to humanity, and  to  this Nation, may have  come after he left office to begin the long dark  walk away  from us, and his beloved  family.  That  this strong, vigorous man was so  removed, so empty, was chilling  for all of us.  The eyes that danced with Irish charm began  to narrow with confusion.  The Nation was deeply moved watching this  much-loved president  face  the  indignities of  Alzheimer’s so bravely and with such conviction. We have been moved  to  seek new  science and new treatments for the cruel disease  that claims  the  last decades of many  Americans, and drains their families.  For all we have said here  today, Ronald  Reagan will be remembered most profoundly  as an eternal optimist, embodying  the quintessential American spirit. At our core, we are  all optimists, thinking about tomorrow. Former  House Speaker Tip O’Neill once  illustrated  President Reagan’s indomitable optimism with  a  story  the President  told him. President  Reagan compared himself  to  the kid who  walks into a room full of horse dung, and asks  excitedly, ‘‘Where’s the pony?’’  I join the House of Representatives today in  honoring the life and service of Ronald Wilson  Reagan and offer my condolences, those of  my family, and those of my South Texas constituents, to Mrs. Reagan and the rest of their  family.  May  the Lord bless President Reagan’s  soul, and comfort Mrs. Reagan and their family in this time of loss.  ",2004

1083,45,2004-06-09,Mr. GARY G.," MILLER of California. Mr.  Speaker, President Ronald Reagan will be remembered in the annals of history as one of  the greatest leaders of the United States. His  deeds and words will echo in time as the foundation  for a smaller, more efficient government, a fairer tax system and the liberation of  millions of oppressed people  throughout  the  world.  Ronald Reagan was known as  the Great  Communicator. His words brought hope  to  those in need, comfort to those who suffered  and optimism to an entire Nation trampled by  economic and governmental  insecurity. Yet  President Reagan’s ability  to  communicate  went beyond  the words  that he spoke. He  reached out to the nation and the world using  not only his voice, but his strength of spirit and  supreme character.  President Reagan’s passing is mourned by  each of us. But his  legacy will  continue  through the ideals he aspired for America. A  grateful Nation thanks Ronald Reagan, a true  American Hero.  ",2004
1084,45,2004-06-09,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself and the people of the 10th Congressional District of Florida who I have the  privilege to represent here in the United States  Congress, I rise in support of this resolution to  pay  tribute  to  the  life of President Ronald  Reagan and  to express condolences  to his  family.  President Reagan was a true American patriot who always kept  life’s priorities—God,  country, and family—in order. He assumed the  Presidency at a  time when Americans were  being held hostage in Iran, our fighting forces  were fraying around the edges, and raging inflation and  interest  rates were  stifling our  economy, sending our Nation into the turmoil  of  recession,  and  driving  our  government  deeper and deeper into debt.  Beginning with his swearing-in as the 40th  President  of  the United States, President  Reagan  restored  in  the American people a  feeling of pride and patriotism that had been  lost  in  the  late 1970s. The hostages were  brought home,  the morale of our  fighting  forces rose, and  the economy began  to rebound.  People  flew  the American  flag with pride  again. The United States resumed its leadership  role  in protecting  freedom and peace  around the world and at the pinnacle of the  world economy. He stared down communist  leaders throughout the world and set the stage  for its fall in the Soviet Union and throughout  Eastern Europe. He reduced the world’s supply of nuclear weapons and allowed democracy to flourish again in our hemisphere and  eventually in the former Soviet states.  He battled Congress  to  reduce  taxes  to  allow  the American people  to keep more of  their hard earned money and  to reduce  the  size and scope of the government programs  and bureaucracy. He also ensured  the  long  term security of the social security trust fund  by leading a bipartisan legislative effort to preserve and protect  the retirement benefits of  workers long into the 21st century.  President Reagan was our Nation’s leading  cheerleader and consoler. He used his wit and  humor to entertain and to drive home an important point. He  led a Nation  in mourning  when we  lost  the Challenger crew and our  Marines  in Lebanon. Throughout his eight  years  in office we  laughed  together and we  cried  together.  In  the end  though, we all  gained a  renewed sense of pride  in being  Americans.  He  taught  us  the  value  of  the  simple  phrases  of  ‘‘peace  through  strength’’  and  ‘‘trust but verify’’ and he shared with all of us  his simple vision of a nation where we would  be the ‘‘shining city on the hill.’’  The United States and the world are better  places  today because of Ronald Reagan’s  service not only as President of our great  country, but as a true patriot. He was a good  man whose love and commitment to his wife  Nancy was an inspiration to us all.  Perhaps  the  greatest  testament  to  his  strength of personality, of character, and of  leadership is the fact that even in death he  can make us feel good about ourselves as individuals and as a Nation. You can feel the  pride of our Nation surge yet again as we reflect on his life and times.  Mr. Speaker, we all will recall that President  Reagan would end his  conversations with  America by saying ‘‘God Bless America.’’ This  week, Mr. Speaker, our Nation and the world  say ‘‘God Bless Ronald Reagan.’’ Thank you  for your lifetime of reminding us to always take  pride  in  living  in  the greatest Nation  in  the  world.

1085,45,2004-06-09,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Speaker, today as this  House honors the life of the Fortieth President  of the United States, Ronald Reagan, we remember both the man and the public servant.  As President Reagan lies in state under the  dome of this Capitol, the American people reflect on a man of optimism, a  leader committed to freedom and a citizen who personified the American spirit of boundless ambition  and achievement.  President Reagan  lived a  life unlike any  other American president. A sports broadcaster, a movie star and a television personality, President Reagan entertained Americans  with his charm, smile and warmth. He combined the skills of an actor with the determination of a pioneer to transform public life as he  entered the political realm in California and finally was elected by the American people to  the White House.  As President of the United States, Ronald  Reagan won  two  large election victories  in  1980 and 1984 to set this Nation on a course  to transform our economy and confront communism. The outcomes and consequences of  his policies will be interpreted by historians for  years to come, but there is no doubt President  Reagan motivated a new generation of conservatives  to  join his crusade as well as a  generation of progressives to unite in pursuit  of an alternative path of action.  Our State of Minnesota had a unique relationship with President Reagan. Minnesota  was the only State in the Union to never give  President Reagan an electoral victory. Minnesotans stood  twice with our homegrown  son, but we respected the President, his skills  as a communicator and his determination to  elevate the American spirit.  President Reagan lived a truly American life  and, in his final years, stood hand in hand with  Mrs. Reagan  to encounter Alzheimer’s with  dignity  and  grace.  The  life  of President  Reagan  the  leader and Ronald Reagan  the  man will be remembered, honored and celebrated this week by Congress, the American  people and people  in nations around  the  world.  On behalf of  the  families of Minnesota’s  Fourth Congressional District, we extend our  prayers and sincerest condolences  to Mrs.  Nancy Reagan, her children and all of  the  family and friends of President Reagan.

1092,52,2004-06-09,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I wish to  make a few remarks regarding President Ronald Reagan. It was in January  1977, as Jimmy Carter prepared to take  the oath of office as President, that  Ronald Reagan met with the man who  would become his chief foreign policy  adviser  for  the next  several years,  Richard Allen.  The two spent several hours together  discussing in detail the vast array of  issues. As Allen recalls—and some people have heard this on the news—as he  has recounted it, Reagan said a whole  range of memorable things, but none  was more profound than this:  My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple and some would say  simplistic. It is this: We win and they lose.  What do you think of that?  Ronald Reagan’s words would have  been shocking to the trained ears of  any foreign policy expert of that day.  The consensus was the cold war simply  could not be won. We could not defeat  communism.  That  is  what  people  thought. That is what they felt. All we  could do was to hope to contain the Soviet Union and chip away at the fringes  of its influence.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Much has been said, much has been  written about our 40th President and  the impact he had on our Nation and  the world. In at least one respect, I believe  part  of  his  legacy  has  been  mischaracterized, and I rise today, as  has my friend and colleague from Missouri, to set the record straight.  The issue that I would like to address  is Ronald Reagan’s view of the size of  Government. It is true that President  Reagan believed the Federal Government was too large and too costly, but  he did not believe that was true of all  governments.  As a former Governor of California,  he believed governments closer to the  people, governments at the State and  local level, had the primary responsibility for essential public service and,  thus, they should have the resources to  respond to public needs.

1096,66,2004-06-09,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  rise today because a mighty oak has  fallen. Ronald Reagan has left his life  here on Earth, but oh what a life it  was. Born in the middle of our great  Republic in the beginning of the last  century, his was an American tale from  start to finish.  Jack and Nelle Reagan brought a son  into the world in Tampico, IL, in 1911.  Jack was a shoe salesman with an  Irishman’s flare for storytelling. Nelle  was a devout Christian who made ends  meet by doing other people’s sewing  out of their home. When Jack first saw  their healthy baby  in his  crib, he  looked at this little baby and said he  looked like a ‘‘little fat Dutchman.’’  And the nickname stuck, ‘‘Dutch.’’  Times were hard for the Reagans. He  commented years later that:  Our family didn’t exactly come from the  wrong side of the tracks, but we were certainly within sound of the train whistles.  Even then, it was in Ronald Reagan’s  character to look for the Sun behind  the clouds. Growing up, he lived a typical American boy’s life. He was a lifeguard in the summer and a football  player in the fall. In the fading years,  when Alzheimer’s robbed him of most  of his memory, he could still summon  up his youth in Illinois, proudly recalling the 77 lives he saved as a lifeguard  from the teeming Rock River, notching  each one on a log on the shore.  In Illinois, he discovered there was  more to  life than  just  football and  lifeguarding. There was also acting.  Connecting with an audience plugged  him into a broader world. As he later  said:  For a kid suffering childhood pangs of insecurity, the applause was music.  Ambition led him westward out of Illinois; Hollywood, to be exact. There,  as we all know, he started his successful acting career and, more  importantly, met a young actress from Chicago named Nancy Davis. She became  the love of his life. Nancy was focused,  smart, and loved her Ronnie. Jimmy  Stewart once remarked:  If Ronnie had married Nancy the  first  time, he would have won an Academy Award.  But gradually his time in front of an  audience changed from the stage and  screen to the assembly hall. Time constraints prevent me from following his  ascent to the highest office in the land.  Let me simply comment that for most  of us being a  successful actor and  pitchman, union president, two-term  Governor of our Nation’s largest State,  and a national figure to boot would  have been enough of a career, especially at the age of 69. But Ronald  Reagan had other  thoughts, and  so  began his run against President Jimmy  Carter for the Presidency in 1980.  Neck and neck until the debate a  week before the election, Reagan broke  it wide open when he closed by asking  Americans a simple question: Are you  better off than you were 4 years ago?  On  election  day, Reagan won  a  smashing victory, winning  44 of  50  States. He would top that mark in 1984,  winning 49 out of 50 States.  I have listened to and read countless  people  reflecting on what President  Reagan meant to them and to America.  Were there enough time, I would fill up  the  rest of  the afternoon with my  thoughts about this great man. But I  will limit my observations to what I  think will be, in addition to restoring  America’s faith in itself, the way history will remember Ronald Reagan, the  peacemaker.  I want to address the question, What  does it mean to have won the cold war?  Revisionists  suggest  that  Ronald  Reagan had little to do with the Soviet  Union’s fall which they now claim was  just inevitable. I can tell you no one  thought that in 1979. Communism was  on the rise and freedom was in retreat.  The United States was the toothless  tiger with the uncertain future. Energy  shortages  crippled us, and  rampant  crime hunted us down. Interest rates  for homes, cars, and businesses were  sky high. Our economy was wrenched  back and forth between bouts of recession and inflation, both at the same  time. America’s decline was marked by  new,  unfamiliar words. We  learned  stagflation,  ‘‘taxflation,’’  and,  of  course, we learned malaise.  America’s economy was not the only  thing in decline. So, too, was our foreign policy. Still suffering from a Vietnam syndrome, we watched and did  VerDate May 21 2004  02:20 Jun 10, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09JN6.022 S09PT1 ",2004
1097,73,2004-06-09,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Illinois.  ,2004
1098,73,2004-06-09,Mr. FITZGERALD.," Mr. President, as  one of the two Senators from Illinois, I  am very proud of Ronald Reagan and  his contributions to this country. Ronald Reagan is the only American President who was, in fact, born in Illinois.  Many people think of Abraham Lincoln  as having been born in Illinois, but he  was actually born  in Kentucky and  later moved there. Of course, I think  there  is  no  question  that Ronald  Reagan will join Abraham Lincoln as  one of our Nation’s greatest Presidents. I only want to say a few words  about him.  I didn’t actually serve in the Senate  when he was President. I didn’t ever  have the opportunity to get to know  him.  I did, however, get the opportunity to meet him once as a very  young man, when I was about 20 years  old or so and he was campaigning for  President in 1980.  But my first real recollection of him  came from watching his address on television in 1976 at the Republican National Convention. He had lost the primaries to incumbent President Gerald  Ford but had nonetheless had a very  strong showing. He gave a speech at  that  1976  convention  that  literally  brought down the house and fired up  the delegates.  I  remember watching  that at home and thinking, What an  outstanding leader. You could see that  this man certainly still had a great  contribution to make.  He won against all the odds. All the  pundits and many of the commentators  dismissed  Ronald  Reagan.  They  thought he was too old. They thought  he was too conservative to run and be  elected President in 1980. But he proved  them all wrong.  I think a pivotal moment came in  1980 during his primary elections. At  that time he lost the Iowa caucuses  and he had a lot of pressure on him to  win the New Hampshire primary. Many  of us will recall that New Hampshire  primary debate where he grabbed the  microphone as they tried to shut it off.  He grabbed the microphone and said:  ‘‘Mr. Green,  I paid  for  this microphone.’’ He wanted his other opponents  to be allowed the opportunity to speak  at that debate, as opposed to just having a one-on-one debate with George  Bush, who later became his Vice President and succeeded him as President.  I remember watching that Nashua,  NH, debate in 1980 from the basement  television room of my fraternity house  in Hanover, NH, at Dartmouth College.  I was very much paying attention to  that primary because it was happening  in New Hampshire where I was attending college. I will never forget seeing  Ronald Reagan in that debate and his  remarkable performance.  Later, in 1980, I had the opportunity  to meet him when he came to Illinois  to campaign  for a U.S. Senate candidate  in October of  1980, about a  month  before  Reagan  was  elected  President. I was actually an intern on  the campaign of a fellow by the name  of Dave O’Neal who was running for the  Senate in Illinois. He actually lost. But  as an intern on that campaign, I had  the  opportunity  to  meet  Ronald  VerDate May 21 2004  03:50 Jun 10, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09JN6.051 S09PT1 ",2004
1099,80,2004-06-09,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I want  to take a few moments today to join  my colleagues in celebrating the life of  our  40th President, Ronald Wilson  Reagan.  In many ways, Ronald Reagan embodied the American dream. He was  born in the small town of Tampico, IL,  and grew up 30 miles down the road in  Dixon, another small town. His was a  normal, middle class American family,  and he was the all-American boy-next-  door: Good-looking, popular, an actor,  and an athlete. And from that modest  background he fulfilled the American  democratic  ideal  that  anybody  can  grow up to become President of the  United States.  That ideal—that anyone can grow up  to become President—captures America’s optimism, so it is fitting that the  word that comes most to mind when  remembering President Reagan is exactly  that:  optimism.  President  Reagan was an incurable and infectious  optimist when it came to America. By  insisting that, as he said, it was morning again  in America, he connected  with Americans,  lifted  their  spirits,  and restored their confidence in our future.  This power to communicate and connect with Americans from all walks of  life was central to his success as President. He  could  sway  skeptics  and  charm supporters with his simple eloquence and self-deprecating wit. People  came to know him and feel comfortable  with him; and they were moved by his  simple,  clear  messages.  President  Reagan perfected the art of selling his  policies to the American people and  using that ability to pressure Congress  to work his will. Not surprisingly, the  Great Communicator, as he came to be  known, left office with the highest approval rating of any recent President.  President Reagan was one of  the  truly  larger than  life  figures of the  post World War II era. He brought a  new  conservative philosophy  to  the  White House, and he championed freedom at home and abroad. One of the  reasons for his success, I believe, was  his willingness to compromise, to put  aside partisan politics and ideological  purity to do what was right for the  country. When his 1981 tax cuts caused  deficits  to  skyrocket,  President  Reagan supported tax increases in 1982  and 1983 to contain the damage. After  tagging the Soviet Union as the Evil  Empire, he negotiated historic arms  control treaties with the Soviets, coining  the  famous  phrase  ‘‘trust,  but  verify’’ in the process. He had, as his  chief of staff Howard Baker once put it,  ‘‘a capacity to surprise.’’  And throughout it all, he was a wonderful man, someone who you couldn’t  help but enjoy being with. I met with  president Reagan several times during  the last years of his presidency. The  last time I was with him, President  Reagan was telling two or three of us  in the White House an Irish story full  of warmth and wit. I believe that best  describes President Reagan himself—a  man of endearing wit and great personal warmth.  As America mourns his passing, my  thoughts and prayers are with Nancy  and the rest of President Reagan’s family and many, many friends. It is my  hope that their memories of his life,  laughter, and legacy will be of some  small comfort in these days and weeks  ahead.  ",2004
1100,80,2004-06-09,Mr. CORZINE.," Mr. President, on Saturday, June 5, 2004, President Ronald  Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of  the United States, passed away after a  decade-long  battle with Alzheimer’s  disease.  I  extend my  deepest  sympathies to the members of his family,  who have suffered a terrible loss, and I  want them to know that Americans  throughout our Nation, regardless of  their political party or ideology, share  in their loss and mourn with them.  Ronald Reagan was an exceptional  national leader who loved this country  and its people. He will long be remembered for his infectious optimism and  his faith in America’s future. To President Reagan, America was always a  shining city on a hill—a beacon of hope  for all mankind. He understood  just  what a great country America is, and  always remained a committed advocate  for the ideal of freedom that helps define us as Americans.  President Reagan was known as the  Great Communicator, and he richly deserved the accolade. Few politicians, if  any, have had his ability not just to  connect with the American people but  to  inspire them. His speeches didn’t  just make a point,  they  touched a  chord. He talked to Americans  in a  powerful and personal way.  As  is widely  understood, Ronald  Reagan had strongly held views about  public policy,  from his  support  for  lower  taxes  to  his  strong  anticommunism. But as is less widely  appreciated, President Reagan was not  inflexible or dogmatic. He actually was  a practical and pragmatic leader who  was willing  to adjust his approach,  sometimes  dramatically,  when  circumstances called for change.  For example, after pushing through a  large tax cut at the start of his Presidency, he reversed course and increased  taxes when the deficit started to explode. Perhaps most importantly, after  denouncing the Soviets as an ‘‘evil empire,’’ he was willing to work closely  and cooperatively with Mikhail Gorbachev, helping not only to end the cold  war but to liberate millions of people  and change the course of world history.  In doing so, he was not following his  party. He was not following the polls.  He was following his conscience. And  the entire world community owes him  a deep debt of gratitude for his vision  and his leadership.  There were many issues about which  I  strongly disagreed with President  Reagan. But I always had great respect  for him personally and for the way he  conducted  himself while  in  office.  President Reagan knew how to disagree without being disagreeable. He  knew that those  in the other party  were not enemies. He knew that, at the  end of the day, we are all Americans  and, though we may disagree about  particular policies, we all share a love  of our country and a commitment to  its future.  President Reagan’s life was marked  by his fundamental personal decency  and his  sense of dignity. That was  never more evident than when he announced to the world his struggle with  Alzheimer’s disease  in 1994. His and  Nancy  Reagan’s  courageous  fight  against  this  debilitating  disease  brought a new awareness to the devastation that accompanies this illness. I  hope it also will bring a new commitment to do what it takes to find a cure  for this horrible affliction.  In conclusion, Americans throughout  our Nation are saddened at the passing  of President Reagan, and our hearts go  out to his family. Ronald Reagan was  an extraordinary man whose impact on  our Nation, and our world, will be felt  for generations to come. Today, we join  together to honor his memory and to  give thanks for his historic service on  behalf of the country he loved so deeply.  ",2004

1102,87,2004-06-09,Mr.  BINGAMAN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am pleased to introduce a bill  that authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in eastern  New Mexico develop the Eastern New  Mexico  Rural  Water  System  (ENMRWS). The water supply to be  made available by this project is absolutely critical to the region’s future. I  look forward to working with my colleagues here  in  the Senate  to help  make this project a reality.  The source of water for the ENMRWS  is Ute Reservoir, a facility constructed  by the State of New Mexico  in the  early 1960s. In 1966, Congress authorized  Reclamation to study the feasibility of  a project that would utilize Ute Reservoir to supply water to communities  in eastern New Mexico (Pub. L. 89–561).  Numerous  studies were  subsequently  completed, but it was not until the late  1990s that several communities, concerned about their reliance on declining and degraded groundwater supplies  in the area, began to plan seriously for  the development of a regional water  system that would make use of the renewable supply available from Ute Reservoir.  As part of that process, the Eastern  New Mexico Rural Water Authority  was formed to carryout the development of the ENMRWS. The Authority  consists of nine communities and three  counties in eastern New Mexicop and  has been very effective in finalizing the  studies and planning necessary to move  forward with the project.  This is a very important bill to the  citizens of New Mexico.  It has  the  broad support of the communities in  the region, as well as financial support  from the State of New Mexico. There is  no question  that completion of  the  ENMRWS will provide communities in  Quay, Roosevelt, and Curry counties  with a long-term renewable source of  water that is needed to sustain current  economic activity and support future  growth and development in the region.  I hope my colleagues will support this  legislation, thereby helping to address  water needs in the rural West.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 2513  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Eastern New  Mexico Rural Water System Act of 2004’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.  (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—  (1) the Entrada Aquifer and the Southern  High Plains (Ogallala) Aquifer—  (A) provide 100 percent of the municipal  and  industrial water supplies  for communities in East Central New Mexico; and  (B) serve a large majority of the agricultural water users in East Central New Mexico;  (2) the Entrada and Southern High Plains  Aquifers are declining in quantity and deteriorating in quality;  (3) despite voluntary conservation efforts  and improvements in agricultural water use  efficiencies, current estimates indicate that  present levels of groundwater use in some  areas of eastern New Mexico are not sustainable beyond 12 to 25 years after the date of  enactment of this Act;  (4) in 1959, the State of New Mexico began  construction of the Ute Dam and Reservoir  on the Canadian River to develop a long-  term sustainable water supply for eastern  New Mexico;  (5) section 2 of Public Law 89–561 (80 Stat.  711) authorized the development of a feasibility study for a water supply project in  eastern New Mexico;  (6) since the feasibility study was authorized, a number of studies have been completed as part of the feasibility study process, including a 1994 study by the New Mexico  Interstate  Stream  Commission  estimating the firm annual yield of water from  Ute Reservoir at 24,000 acre-feet per year;  (7) in March 1997, the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission and the Ute Water  Commission entered into an agreement for  the purchase of 24,000 acre-feet of water per  year for beneficial consumptive use in eastern New Mexico;  (8) the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water  Authority was established to plan, finance,  develop, and operate the Eastern New Mexico  Rural Water System;  (9) the conceptual design report for the  Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System—  (A) was finalized in August 2003;  (B) incorporates a Bureau of Reclamation  willingness and ability to pay report prepared in August 2002; and  (C) was subject to a peer review process  that resulted in a supplement to the conceptual design report, the Eastern New Mexico  Rural Water System Conceptual Design Peer  Review Final Report (December 2003);  (10) the State of New Mexico—  (A) strongly supports the development of  the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System; and  (B) has appropriated amounts to the New  Mexico Water Trust Fund to assist communities in eastern New Mexico in securing the  financial resources necessary to provide an  acceptable cost share for development of the  system; and  (11) completion of the Eastern New Mexico  Rural Water System would provide Quay,  Roosevelt, and Curry Counties in the State  of New Mexico with a long-term reliable and  renewable source of water that would—  (A) sustain current economic activity; and  (B) support future economic development  and growth in the region.  (b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to  authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  provide financial and technical assistance to  the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority to plan, design, and construct the  Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System to  provide a long-term reliable and renewable  source of water to communities in eastern  New Mexico.

1107,101,2004-06-09,Mr. GARY G.," MILLER of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise to pay tribute today to a man  who served his country with dignity, and lived  his life with honor. Mr. Kenneth Wents of Hacienda Heights, California, will always be  remembered for his courage and heart.  Mr. Wents led a full and exciting life. Even  as a prisoner of war during World War II for  forty-two months, he faced extraordinary challenges with determination and optimism.  Mr. Wents touched the lives of many, especially the generous volunteers of the Greater  La Puente Valley Meals on Wheels, who valued him and appreciated his warm spirit.  Mr. Speaker, the life of Mr. Kenneth Wents  has greatly impacted the lives of many in a  positive way. It is my honor to join his family  and friends in commemorating his legacy. f  150TH ANNIVERSARY OF FLOWER  MOUND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH  HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 9, 2004 ",2004
1108,101,2004-06-09,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, heralded as  the first Presbyterian church in Denton County, Flower Mound Presbyterian Church is celebrating its 150th Anniversary. I am proud to  congratulate Flower Mound Presbyterian on  this great accomplishment.  Flower Mound Presbyterian Church’s main  priority is to foster a sense of ‘‘family’’ within  its membership and, at the same time, open  its doors wide  to welcome  the community.  They continue the church’s rich legacy of religious service to Flower Mound residents.  The church has lovingly preserved its original furnishings and all of the cherished memories  that go with  them. Each Sunday,  the  sanctuary is flooded with music from an oldstyle piano donated years ago. The original  pews still sit in their initial circular arrangement  around the lectern which also dates back to  the church’s beginnings in 1854.  The church remembers its past with numerous photo albums depicting the congregation  as  it has grown  in number and  traditions  through  the years.  Images of  the church’s  steeple being constructed provide a visual representation of the changes the church has undergone over time.  The church’s white clapboard building,  located in the area formerly known as ‘‘the Long  Prairie,’’ witnessed Flower Mound’s growth  from a sleepy rural hamlet to a vibrant suburban community. Flower Mound Presbyterian  Church will commemorate  its 150 years by  erecting a historical marker in its cemetery.  Congratulations to the congregation at Flower Mound Presbyterian Church on their anniversary. One hundred and fifty years of worship is a milestone to be celebrated. HONORING THE MARIPOSA COUNTY COURTHOUSE ON  ITS  150TH  ANNIVERSARY  HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 9, 2004 ",2004
1109,101,2004-06-09,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  the Mariposa County Courthouse on its 150 years of service to the needs  of the community of Mariposa. The courthouse  is  holding  numerous  anniversary  events  throughout 2004 leading up to the actual anniversary.  Founded on September 8, 1850, the courthouse was built on land donated by Mr. John  C. Fremont and cost a mere $9,300 to construct. Throughout the last century and a half,  the courthouse underwent several additions,  including a clock tower in 1866, its first telephone in 1895, and electric lights in 1907. In  1958, the courthouse was officially recognized  as a California State Landmark and was  added  to  the National Register of Historic  Places in 1977.  The court has operated continuously ever  since it’s opening in 1850, making it the oldest, active  courthouse west of  the Rocky  Mountains. Today, the original clock keeps the  residents of Mariposa on time, just as it had  done for the last 100 years. In addition, the  services of  the  court have expanded  into  seven departments, including criminal, family  law, small claims and traffic.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is my sincere pleasure  to  congratulate  and  honor  the  residents  of  Mariposa for their preservation and dedication  to  the Mariposa County Courthouse  for  the  last 150 years. I urge my colleagues to join  me  in wishing  the Mariposa County Courthouse many more years of continued success. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. JOHN R.

1111,101,2004-06-09,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of Mr. Robert Ervin Taylor in honor  of his retirement as City Manager of Colonial  Heights, Virginia for serving 20 years of dedicated service from 1984 to 2004.  In 1968, Mr. Taylor received his Bachelor of  Science in History and Political Science from  Appalachian State University. Upon the completion of his Master of Public Administration  from the University of Tennessee in 1972, he  became  the Senior Administrative Analyst  in  the Budget Office of the Finance Department  for  the City of Nashville-Davidson County.  From 1973 to 1979, Mr. Taylor served as Assistant  to  the City Manager and Director of  Personnel and Budget for the City of Suffolk,  Virginia. He  later served  five years as City  Manager for the City of Red Bank, Tennessee.  As City Manager for Colonial Heights, Mr.  Robert Ervin Taylor has been responsible for  the implementation of policies adopted by the  City Council under the direction of five mayors  and 22 council members. In addition, he has  been in charge of enforcing all city laws and  ordinances, the appointment and supervision  of heads of 12 departments, and the preparation and execution of an annual $38 million  operating and $3.5 million capital  improvements budget.  With a penchant for community service and  natural leadership, Mr. Taylor has served on  several state, local and regional organizations.  He has served as chairman of the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority and  the  South Central Wastewater Authority. Moreover, he was  the Treasurer/Secretary of  the  Appomattox River Water Authority, and was  on the Board of Directors for the Crater Planning District Commission and  the Colonial  Heights Chamber of Commerce. Additionally,  he served as  the President of  the Colonial  Heights Kiwanis Club.  Mr. Taylor has worked closely with the community to ensure the best quality of care for  the citizens of Colonial Heights. He has been  instrumental in carrying out the vision that has  been set forth for the community; as such, the  people have been able  to rely on  the dedicated and dependable service of Mr. Taylor.  Because of Mr. Taylor’s  resounding success, and his dedicated years of service the  Colonial Heights community has benefited immensely from his leadership. He has consistently demonstrated a remarkable spirit of unity  in his relations with other leaders in the community and an equal level of enthusiasm for  serving the Colonial Heights area.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Mr.  Robert Ervin Taylor for his loyal and dedicated  service and  the many contributions he has  made to his community. f  A TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR  CHIEN-JEN CHEN  HON.

C.J. Chen has a long and distinguished career in public service. A highly-respected academic, he still holds the position of Associate  Professor at  the Graduate School of Diplomacy at National Chengchi University.  Prior to his appointment as his nation’s representative to the United States, Ambassador  Chen served  in  the Legislative Yuan of  the  Republic of China, rising  to  the position as  Chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Immediately preceding his current assignment,  he served as Taiwan’s Foreign Affairs Minister.

1113,3,2004-06-21,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, energy  independence should be a goal of this  Congress. Worldwide demand for petroleum has increased during the last decade, and the growth of production has  been relatively flat. The inevitable result is higher prices at the gasoline  pump, and the reality is that it takes  time to go from the oil field to the gasoline station, and we have lost considerable time in this regard.  In 1995, in the 104th Congress, H.R.  2491, which was passed, would have allowed oil exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The Department of Energy has estimated that between 1 and 1.3 million barrels of oil a  day could be derived from this source.  Unfortunately, in 1995, that legislation was vetoed by then-President Clinton.  That was nearly 10 years ago; and  given a time line of 7 to 14 years for  building the pipeline structure, it is  time we can scarcely afford.  Mr. Speaker, I have been to ANWR.  The vast coastal plain is unsuitable for  habitation during the summer months  because of its marshy consistency. Any  caribou unlucky enough to calve  in  this  region would  likely  die  from  exsanguination at  the hands of  the  mosquitoes there.  The people in ANWR are counting on  this Congress to do the right thing and  allow  them,  the  rightful owners of  these mineral rights, to begin developing the resources that are granted to  them upon statehood in 1959.  As we say in Texas, ‘‘Time’s a wasting.’’  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2004

RES. 591  Whereas, since our Nation’s founding, community banks have supported their communities as they prospered and grew, and today  more than 8,700 community banks continue  the tradition of giving back to their local  communities through nearly 40,000 banking  offices;  Whereas, with more than $2,275,000,000,000  in assets, community banks know that when  money stays in town it becomes a renewable  resource, creating an economic cycle that  constantly revitalizes and stimulates local  communities;  Whereas community banks are working  citizens in their communities in every sense  of the word with more than 514,000 full-time  and part-time employees;  Whereas these banks have made significant  contributions to the economic well-being of  our Nation through their financial support,  their  dedication  as  good neighbors  and,  above all, their service as financially sound  and reliable sources of economic lifeblood in  our communities;  Whereas the Nation’s community banks  focus on the prosperity of individuals and  small businesses  in their hometowns and  have reinvested, on average, 95 percent of  their  loan portfolio  in their own communities through home mortgages and small  business, agricultural, and student loans;  Whereas community banks play a significant role in local economic development efforts by financing new businesses and stimulating the economy to produce jobs and new  opportunities and, as a group, they contribute an important and strong part of the  Nation’s economic fabric;  Whereas  community  banks  have made  nearly 3,160,000 loans to small businesses, totaling over $275,500,000,000 and nearly 720,500  loans  to  small  farms,  totaling  nearly  $37,500,000,000;  Whereas community banks also enjoy the  trust of their customers; indeed, community  banks are just neighbors are helping neighbors build their homes, save for higher education, plan for retirement and fulfill other  dreams; and  Whereas  community  banks  have  long  helped in the development of our communities and the Nation as a whole, and are  fully prepared to make many more contributions: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That—  (1) the House of Representatives expresses  its gratitude for the contributions made by  America’s community banks to the Nation’s  economic well-being and prosperity; and  (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that—  (A) a ‘‘Community Banking Month’’ should  be designated to raise public awareness of,  and public appreciation  for, the contributions of the helpful institutions that are our  Nation’s community banks; and  (B) the President should issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United  States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.

1119,3,2004-06-21,Mr. RENZI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 591 expresses  the  gratitude  for  the  contributions  made by America’s community banks  to the Nation’s economic well-being  and prosperity and the sense of the  House of Representatives that a month  should be designated as Community  Banking Month. This legislation was  introduced by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BACHUS) to recognize community banks for their contribution to  the very fabric of our community.  Community banks help to shape communities into centers of commerce and  entrepreneurship and provide for community and industrial development.  Community bankers are themselves  among the leading leaders of our community, engaging in civic and benevolent activities. Nationwide, there are  over 8,700 community banks serving  their  local communities through almost 40,000 banking offices.  Community banks have reinvested on  average 95 percent of their loan portfolio in their own communities through  home mortgages and small businesses,  agricultural, and student loans. This  reinvestment plays an important role  in local economic development and in  efforts to finance new businesses, as  well as stimulating the local economy  to produce jobs and new opportunities.

The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 3751  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.

1125,17,2004-06-21,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I might consume.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Committee on Government Reform, I rise  in support of H.R. 3751, an important  piece of legislation for all Federal employees. This bill requires the Federal  Government to analyze available options to provide those who work in the  civil service with better dental and vision benefits. These benefits may be  provided through the existing structure of the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program or as stand-alone additional coverage.  Specifically, H.R. 3751 requires the  Office of Personnel Management  to  study and to submit a report to Congress on how the government can provide dental and vision benefits to Federal employees.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentlewoman  from Virginia  (Mrs. JO  ANNDAVIS), the distinguished Chair of  the Subcommittee on Civil Service and  Agency Organization, for offering H.R.  3751; and I certainly congratulate her  today for moving the bill to the floor  today. Along with the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. TOMDAVIS), the chairman of the full Committee on Government Reform, as well as my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. DAVIS), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Civil Service and Agency Organization, the gentleman  from Virginia  (Mrs. JOANN  DAVIS) is a leader in the Congress in  representing the Nation’s integral and  steadfast Federal employees.  Every single day, civil servants protect the Nation’s streets. They teach  our children, they deliver the mail,  they treat the sick, the injured. They  perform countless other duties  that  help make America thrive.  H.R. 3751 a terrific step towards providing  these  individuals  with  the  health benefits that they have earned  and deserve. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
1126,17,2004-06-21,Ms. NORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, visual health and oral  health  are  integral  to  our  general  health, as the House well knows. Oral  and eye diseases are progressive and  become more complex over time. Our  ability to eat, see, read,  learn, and  communicate all depend on good visual  and oral health.  Periodic eye and dental examinations  are an important part of routine preventive health care. Many visual and  oral  conditions  present  no  obvious  symptoms. Therefore, individuals often  are unaware that such problems exist.  There are safe and effective measures  to prevent the most common eye and  dental diseases. That is why early diagnosis and treatment are important for  maintaining  good  visual  and  oral  health and why a vision and dental  benefit should be made available to  Federal employees and annuitants.  We know that in 1987 the Office of  Personnel Management stopped plans  in the Federal Health Benefits program  from adding new vision and dental  packages. OPM did so for various reasons. However, the decision was made  over 15 years ago, and it is time to take  a fresh look at how we can meet the  visual and oral health needs of Federal  employees.  In  the  long  run, preventive  care,  through  periodic  examinations  and  doctor visits, will help keep down long-  term vision and dental costs due to  early detection.  To further improve the bill, during  subcommittee  consideration  of H.R.  3751, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  DAVIS) offered an amendment requiring  OPM to  include glaucoma screening  and hearing benefits in its study.  The amendment would require OPM  to study the  feasibility of providing  hearing benefits to Federal employees  and retirees. Currently, over 28 million  Americans suffer hearing loss, half of  whom are under the age of 50. Hearing  loss  is not  just a problem affecting  adults. Thirty-three children are born  every day with some form of hearing  loss. With early detection and treatment, these children can be taught in  regular classes, saving a school system  as much as half a billion dollars during  a 12-year education.  Like vision and dental benefits, most  insurance plans do not provide hearing  benefits, such as coverage for hearing  aids. We believe the Federal Government should consider taking a lead in  this area.  In addition to hearing benefits, the  gentleman  from Illinois’  (Mr. DAVIS)  amendment required OPM to include  VerDate May 21 2004  03:45 Jun 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K21JN7.017 H21PT1 ",2004

He retired all  27 Atlanta Braves he faced to lead his  team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, to a  2–0 victory. It took him 117 pitches to  throw the first perfect game, and first  no-hitter,  in Diamondbacks’ history.  Johnson became only the 17th pitcher  in major league history to pitch a perfect game. On this day in May, Randy  Johnson was,  indeed, perfect. He recorded 13 strikeouts, and he put out the  other 14 Atlanta hitters during his dazzling display of pitching dominance.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3846 would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture and  the Secretary of the Interior to enter  into an agreement or contract with Indian tribes meeting certain criteria to  carry out projects to protect Indian  forest land.  Last summer, reservations were invaded by catastrophic fires from adjacent Federal lands. In southern California, 11 reservations were burned, 2  completely, and a number of lives were  tragically lost. After witnessing firsthand the horrible aftermath of these  fires, the chairman of the Committee  STEIN on Resources, the gentleman from California  (Mr. POMBO), promised to develop and move legislation that would  help tribes protect their Land.  To follow through with that pledge,  and in the spirit of bipartisan Healthy  Forest Restoration Act, Senator FEINand the gentleman  from California (Chairman POMBO) adopted and  introduced the Tribal Forestry Protection Act. This legislation will provide a  process whereby tribes can engage in  projects on adjacent Forest Service and  BLM lands to treat excessive fuels and  engage in other restoration activities.  By passing this legislation, Congress  will be sending a strong and clear message to the agencies that tribes need to  be an integral part of the thoughtful  management of our Federal lands, for  the betterment and safety of all.

1140,38,2004-06-21,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  last week, on the floor of this Chamber,  there were two interesting 1-hour presentations. The first hour came from  the other side of the aisle, from the Republican side. Members from Texas and  SCHAKOWSKY). We,  Illinois, Members  from Arizona and  West Virginia, Members from Florida,  Indiana,  from my State of Ohio all  spoke on the floor and talked about the  growing economy, how the American  economy is back.  They talked about corporate profits  being up. They talked about economic  prosperity. They said that our economy was in fine, fine shape. In fact,  they  quoted President Bush’s Secretary of Commerce who said,  ‘‘It is  the best economic climate in my lifetime.’’ That was the first hour.  The next hour a group of us from  mostly Ohio, the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. RYAN),  the  gentlewoman  from  Ohio (Mrs. JONES), the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. STRICKLAND), was joined by  the gentlewoman  from  Illinois  (Ms.  instead of sort of  cheerleading this economic growth, we  talked instead or related stories from  people in our districts and letters we  had received about people struggling  with stagnating wages, with tuition increases. Ohio State’s tuition will go up  13 percent this fall. Akron University’s  tuition went up 16 percent last fall. We  talked about gas prices, people’s difficulty  of  dealing with  higher  gas  prices, of diminishing health care benefits, the employers cutting prescription  drug benefits, all of that.  In my State of Ohio, we have lost one  out of six manufacturing  jobs since  President  Bush  took  office.  Some  228,000 jobs overall have disappeared in  my State since the President took the  oath of office in 2001. In fact, because  we have lost 2.5 million jobs since he  took office, President Bush will be the  first President since Herbert Hoover to  have had a net loss of jobs.  Now, we can talk about how much  corporate profits are up, and that is a  good thing for sure. We can talk about  some economic growth, and this is a  good thing; but when we look at the  economy and we look at the kinds of  job loss and we think about what that  job loss means, first of all, a steelworker in Canton, Ohio; an auto worker in Lorain, Ohio; a textile worker in  North Carolina that loses a job that  pays $10 or $12 or $15 or $20 an hour, depending on the plant and the location,  what  that means when  that  family  loses that job, if perhaps the members  of the family can find another job, that  certainly will pay less, if they can find  anything else, but  think what  that  means to that family and those children and to the schools in that district  where that plant closed down.  The city of Cleveland  laid off 600  teachers starting this fall. Classrooms  in Cleveland now will average 30 students per classroom. Layoffs  in my  home city of Lorain,  several dozen  teachers  lost  their  jobs because we  have lost industrial jobs. Police and  fire are  laid off, which  is a greater  hardship on those families and greater  hardship on the communities that they  face, which will then have slower police and fire response time.

1141,45,2004-06-21,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr. Speaker,  reclaiming my time, I think it is important to note that. Again, I am not sure  about whether it was an aspirin factory, but I think what is really important is the point that the gentleman  from Hawaii  just  made about oversight.  It is clear that there are no weapons  of mass destruction. It is clear that the  kind of relationship that has been suggested by the administration, particularly the Vice President and the President, does not exist. It is, I dare say,  hurting our credibility.  We come to this as Americans. You  know that, I know that, and we all  know that. And this information comes  from a variety of sources, whether it be  from Bob Woodward, who describes a  conversation  that Secretary Powell  has, or whether it is Paul O’Neill.  In the case of Richard Clarke, the  terrorist chief, in the aftermath of 9/11,  he writes in his book he expected the  administration to focus its military response on Osama bin Laden and al  Qaeda. He says he was surprised that  the  talk  quickly  turned  to  Iraq.  ‘‘Rumsfeld was saying that we needed  to bomb Iraq,’’ Clark said, ‘‘and we all  said no, no. Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan.  We need to bomb Afghanistan. And  Rumsfeld said, there aren’t any good  targets in Afghanistan, and there are a  lot of good targets in Iraq.  ‘‘Well, there are a lot of good targets  in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing  (Mr. ABERCROMBIE)  to do with 9/11.  Initially  I thought  when he said there are not enough targets in Afghanistan, I thought he was  joking. They wanted to believe there  was a connection, but the CIA was sitting at that particular meeting, and  the FBI was sitting there, and I was  sitting there, and we  looked at the  issue for years, and we reached a conclusion that there was no connection.’’  The point is, let it go. To follow the  admonition of David Kay, it is time to  acknowledge our mistakes as a Nation  and to begin to restore some of our  credibility internationally.  I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE).  b2100  ",2004
1142,45,2004-06-21,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to make a comment. I want to  pose a important question to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) if he  could help us out.  My comment is on the difference between connection and action and collaboration. I do not think there is any  question  that  there had been  some  communication between al-Qaeda and  some  Iraqi officials.  I think we all  agree on that, and have for a long period of time. The September 11 Commission reported that back in 1994, bin  Laden had essentially asked for help  from Iraq but Iraq said no deal. We are  not going to help you.  And  from  that,  the September  11  Commission  concluded,  a  bipartisan  commission concluded there had been  no collaboration and there had been no  active work between the two. In fact,  the two highest bin Laden associates  we have in custody have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al-  Qaeda and Iraq.  I think an accurate picture that has  been stated is that there were some  contacts and that bin Laden had asked  for help and Iraq had refused to give  him help. And yet the President started this war. Now, the question I have is  what was the President trying to do in  this conversation with the American  people? It appears to me that he was  trying to create an impression in the  American people that Iraq was behind  the attack of September 11. Let me  give you just one quote that fits into  that impression. On September 14, 2003,  Vice President CHENEYsaid ‘‘If we are  successful in Iraq, then we will have  struck a major blow right at the heart  of the base, if you will, the geographic  base of the terrorists who have had us  under assault now for many years, but  most especially on 9/11.’’  That is just one of hundreds of statements made by  this administration  that to me was responsible for creating  an impression in at least 69 percent of  the American people that Iraq was behind  it and that this was pay-back  time. In fact, I remember seeing a tank  as it entered Baghdad with it was lettered on the side ‘‘pay back time.’’ And  I can understand why soldiers felt that  way  if the President of the United  States was creating an impression that  Iraq was responsible for September 11.  It was not an impression that led this  country to war that bin Laden had  asked for help, but Iraq had said no,  that is not the salient feature that led  to this war. What led to this war was  the President succeeding in creating an  impression in America that Iraq was  behind  this venous and evil attack  against us on September 11.  So the question to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) if I can ask  him, just kind of two questions, does  he share my view that probably a majority of Americans had the impression  as the result of  its Federal Government’s dissemination of  information,  the administration, that Iraq was behind  in some  fashion, or associated  with the attack on September 11?  And if that is true, does he think the  President of  the United States did  enough to be candid with the American  people to tell the American people that  no, we do not have any evidence of collaboration resulting in the attack of  September 11. Sincere question.  ",2004
1143,45,2004-06-21,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is the President went to war with Iraq because of  two reasons: One, weapons of mass destruction; and two, the threat to security in the Middle East and the United  States of America, and because there  were indications of a connection between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.  And there is documentation even stated in the 9/11 Commission report or in  the 9/11 Commission statement.  ",2004
1144,45,2004-06-21,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr. Speaker,  reclaiming my time, if one reviews the 9/  11  report,  they are very clear  that  there were more  connections, more  connections between Lebanon, between  Iran and al-Qaeda than there ever were  between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda, in fact, Osama bin Laden, in  1990 right after the invasion of Kuwait,  went to Saudi Arabia and met with  Prince Sultan, who was the defense  minister and said that we have to do  something about that secularist. Let  us join forces and destroy Saddam Hussein. He considered Saddam Hussein as  an apostate, a corrupter of Islam.  The point is, and again, another report that came out today, Chairman  Kean, again suggests that the connections between Pakistan, between Iran  and Hezbollah, far exceeded the connections between Saddam Hussein and  al-Qaeda. There was no collaborative  relationship. We  continued  to hear  about al-Qaeda bases  in  Iraq. They  were in northern Iraq under the protection of the no-fly zone.  ",2004

1146,52,2004-06-21,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas  for that very comprehensive talk.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. KENNEDY).  ",2004
1147,52,2004-06-21,Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Indiana for yielding to me.  There are some, both at home and  abroad, who would have us believe that  Abu Ghraib is the true face of this war,  that the acts of a few troubled individuals  represent our  cause.  I believe  there is a dramatically different face,  and I would like to describe it to the  Members.  In a recent news story, Lt. Riley  Sharon,  an Army  emergency  room  charge nurse  from St. Cloud, Minnesota, a city I am proud to represent,  and a fellow alumnus from St. John’s  University, tells of  incidents at the  Abu Ghraib prison when it came under  attack  from mortars  fired by  insurgents, killing scores of prisoners and  wounding hundreds of detainees.  In  one  4-hour  period,  insurgents  killed 22 detainees and Lt. Sharbonno’s  group treated over 100 enemy detainee  patients. At the time Sharbonno and  his fellow soldiers were fighting to save  the lives of those who might have gladly taken theirs, they were under such  heavy fire, they had to wear a Kevlar  helmet and a bullet-proof vest.  As Lt. Sharbonno said,  ‘‘I am unaware of any military in the history of  war that has built an entire hospital  for the exclusive treatment of enemy  detainees or POWs. I don’t understand  the media’s insistence on ignoring the  atrocities committed by anti-coalition  forces or the amazing things that the  military has accomplished over here.’’  The brave work of the likes of Lt.  Sharbonno is the real face of this war.  This is the courage, compassion, and  humanity of the American soldiers who  fight for us all in this war on terror.  Too little attention has been paid to  their noble work and sacrifices. Too  little attention has also been paid to  recent successes  in moving  Iraq towards a democratic  form of government.  The  Iraqi Governing Council  has  shown some real  initiative recently.  They selected a president America supposedly did not want and a prime minister the UN did not want. But by  showing independence, they now have  more credibility amongst  Iraqis and  the international community. The Security Council approved of a new government by a unanimous 15-to-nothing  vote. The new interim government got  to work early,  integrated the many  independent militias so that they are  now part of the solution, not a potential problem, and reorganized Iraqi security forces. Al Sadr is now trying to  be a political force rather than a leader  of a rebellious militia.  There is no doubt that there will be  further bumps in the road on the way  to an elected government, but there  can also be no doubt that significant  progress has been made.  And then we look at the actions of  our enemies. If there is any remaining  doubt that this is truly a war between  good and evil, it should be gone. One  can have no doubt at the depths of the  enemies will or hatred when we are  forced to confront the atrocities committed against Nick Berg and Paul  Johnson.  The insurgents attack oil pipelines, a  source of hope  for the Iraqi people.  What is the point in this? Since the liberation of Iraq, the wealth of her natural resources is hers again. An Iraqi-  led Oil Ministry controls the pipeline  with revenues going to the Iraqi treasury. Iraqi officials disburse the profits  for the benefit of Iraqis.  With the fall of the dictator’s regime,  the money no longer goes to encourage  hopeless and desperate Palestinian use  to kill themselves while they murder  innocent. The revenues no longer subsidize a megalomaniac’s architectural  fantasies in the form of grandiose palaces. It no longer subsidizes the sadistic whims of the dictator’s sons.  The  revenue  from  Iraqi oil are a  chance for the Iraqi people to use their  own natural resources to educate Iraqi  children, to build an Iraqi health care  system, an infrastructure, and a strong  Iraqi economy.  Mr. Speaker, the important question  we should ask ourselves is why are the  terrorists so desperate? Why are they  willing to commit so many inhumane  acts not just against Americans, but  against the Iraqi people as well? The  terrorist leader Zarqawi’s memo to Al  Qaeda’s leader, Osama bin Laden, in  that we find the explanation for their  desperation.  When pleading for bin Laden’s assistance in the Iraqi insurgency, Zarqawi  makes clear that his insurgency has  failed to engender support within the  country. Zarqawi also acknowledges  that they have been unable to scare  Americans  into  leaving, having been  disabused of the idea that he had earlier  professed  that Americans were  ‘‘the biggest cowards that God has created.’’ We have certainly proved him  wrong. He believes that the insurgents  might be able to win if they are able to  kill enough Shiites so that the Shiites  will attack the Sunni minority, that  by creating such turmoil, there will be  a civil war. They clearly understand  what is at stake, the terrorists do. I  hope we do.  ",2004
1148,52,2004-06-21,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that eloquent statement.  Let me say that the gentleman from  California (Mr. ROHRABACHER) will be  going into detail in just a few minutes  about the reasons why 9–11 occurred.  And let me say one more thing, Mr.  Speaker, and that is if we had had foresight that Winston Churchill had prior  to World War II, we would have saved  50 million  lives. President Bush has  that  foresight, and he  is doing the  right thing right now.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on June  30th, Iraq will assume control of its own destiny. Iraq will enter the post-Saddam era with  the hope of the world resting upon them. No  longer will the Iraqi people be subjected to a  climate of  fear and desperation. Saddam’s  murderous,  thieving cronies have been  removed. Uday and Qusay’s henchmen likewise,  will no longer be free to roam the streets, terrorizing their people.  The challenge now for the Iraqi people and  their new government is to set their future on  a course for open thought, popular choice of  their leaders, and freedom of action in which  to conduct their lives and their futures.  The Iraqi people must understand that, with  this new-found freedom comes responsibility—  a responsibility to remember the interests of  all Iraqis. Each and every Iraqi has a stake in  that nation’s future and now with our transfer  of sovereignty to them, that stake can be fully  realized.  We are thrilled to have played a role in empowering the Iraqi people and supporting them  in  their efforts  to rebuild  their country, after  decades of corruption and oppression. They  have  the opportunity  to make  their nation a  shining light for all to see, not only in the Middle East, but around the world. A nation filled  with talent beyond imagination, Iraq can create  a climate of freedom and opportunity for others to emulate.  Problems have arisen.

France and Germany in particular are pushing to lift the arms embargo;  France because  the government  is under  pressure from its defense industry to resume  arms sales; and Germany because it wants to  maintain its currently good and close relationship with Beijing.  Opponents to lifting the ban include, most  vociferously, the USA. . . .  Richard Fisher, from the Jamestown Foundation,  told  [Janes  Intelligence Review]:  ‘‘The real impact of a deep and wide EU-PLA  [People’s Liberation Army]—  The army of China, the People’s Republic of China—  military alliance will fall on the USA, in  terms of accelerating a military-technical  arms race that will burden U.S. taxpayers  and place ever greater pressure on the U.S.  political/military alliance system in Asia.’’  Who are these countries protecting  or helping in this language I want to  strike out of this bill that have these  offsetting reciprocal agreements with  the United States? They include Belgium,  Denmark,  Germany,  Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland—  all European Union countries. Others  that are also exempt by other features  include France,  Italy,  and Luxembourg—all European Union countries.  We are going to contribute to their  building up their defense  industries,  and  then  they  are  going  to  turn  around, most  likely,  soon and  sell  those products, that technology, those  military advantages to a country in opposition  to  our  foreign  policy  and  against our own military  interests,  against our own national security interests.  That is just one example of how this  kind of expediency and also the corporate pressures that drive some of it  are a danger to our national security  and to our future economic strength.  In conclusion, for the last 70 years,  ‘‘Buy America’’ has worked for America, and it has helped Americans work  in America to build a strong national  defense,  to build a  strong national  economy, and to build a strong American industrial base until this administration arrived. The Bush administration believes evidently we can have a  strong national defense and a strong  national  economy without a  strong  American  industrial  base,  without  Americans making American products  in American communities. They are so  indifferent to that need that at a time  when the United States has lost over  2.5 million manufacturing jobs held by  2.5 million American workers in the  last 31⁄2 years, they support this bill  and its language to send more American taxpayers’ dollars to pay for foreign products made by foreign workers.  Maybe those who do not care about  other Americans’ jobs should offer to  give up their own job. Practice what  they preach and  find out  for themselves what unemployment  is really  like. But it is our responsibility, exercising our collective wisdom, to act in  the best interests of the United States  of America.  I know my colleagues share that desire. We may have our honest differences and disagreements, but I beseech my colleagues in this instance to  review this measure and this language  and consider the consequences of it for  our military  strength,  for our economic strength, as well as for the jobs  of Americans and the quality of products and the security of products provided to the men and women serving  courageously around the globe.  I yield the floor.  EXHIBIT1  [From Jane’s Intelligence Review, June 1,  2004]  EUROPECONSIDERSENDINGCHINESEARMS  EMBARGO  (By John Hill)  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began his  first official visit to Europe on 5 May with  the  issue of  lifting the European Union’s  (EU) ban on the sale of weapons systems to  China high on his agenda.  Beijing had hoped that a decision to end  the ban would be made at the meeting of EU  foreign ministers on 26 April, but at the annual Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) held in  Dublin a week earlier, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Brian Cowen, said that a change  in the issue was unlikely during Ireland’s EU  presidency. Undaunted, in Brussels on 5 May,  Wen  said:  ‘‘I have great confidence  that  there will be a solution to this problem.’’  For months now it has appeared that the  arms embargo, which was imposed following  the Tiananmen Square  violence  in  1989,  would be scrapped, and Beijing certainly has  many powerful European friends working on  its behalf. Javier Solana, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Policy, as well as  representatives from both France and Germany have in recent months assured the Chinese publicly that they think the time has  come to resume arms sales.  On the European side, the attractions of  tapping China’s defence market are significant: China is the world’s largest importer of  defence equipment (US$3.6bn-worth in 2002),  and currently Russia is the main beneficiary.  According to Jean-Pierre Cabestan of the  French National Centre for Scientific Research, France and Germany in particular  are pushing to lift the arms embargo: France  because the government is under pressure  from its defence industry to resume arms  sales; and Germany because  it wants  to  maintain its currently good and close relationship with Beijing. Both the European  Aeronautic Defence  and Space Company  (EADS) and the French electronics company  Thales told JIR that although they do not  currently  export military  equipment  to  China, they are monitoring the situation.  Opponents to lifting the ban include, most  vociferously, the USA. In January, Richard  Boucher, spokeswoman for the US Department of State, said: ‘‘Our statutes and regulations prohibit sales of defence  items to  China. We believe that others should maintain their current arms embargoes as well.  We believe that the US and European prohibitions on arms sales are complementary,  were imposed for the same reasons, specifically serious human rights abuses, and that  those reasons remain valid today.’’ The UK  is  remaining circumspect; although obviously its defence industry would like to sell  to the Chinese market, the government is reportedly upholding the US line on the issue.  There is debate over the consequences that  lifting the ban would have. Professor Shen  Dingli, an expert in International Relations  at Shanghai’s Fudan University, told JIR:  ‘‘[Ending the embargo] won’t be significant,  as China has its own arms research, development and manufacturing capability, and can  access Russia’s military aircraft and ship  technology. Reportedly, soon China will acquire its own manufacturing capability of  more modern military aircraft, and by that  time, China will export its own technology.’’  However, the USA remains worried that  the end of the embargo could spark an arms  race. US China analyst Richard Fisher, from  the Jamestown Foundation, told JIR: ‘‘The  real impact of a deep and wide EU–PLA [People’s Liberation Army] military alliance will  fall on the USA, in terms of accelerating a  military-technical arms race that will burden US taxpayers and place ever greater  pressure on the US political/military alliance system in Asia.’’ Fisher argued that if  the ban was  lifted, the French would be  ‘‘first out of the gate’’ with submarine and  satellite technology. He added that the competition would also spur on the Russians,  who ‘‘are now openly talking about selling  advanced  SSK  [submarine]  co-production  rights to the PLA to trump the EU’’.

1162,94,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," I will not characterize  it as opposition, but a Senator on this  side has indicated to me that he wishes  to address this amendment before I as  manager can speak for the committee.  Actually, this is a matter now before  our committee. Out of respect for him,  I just ask it be laid aside.  ",2004
1163,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," I have no problem with  laying that aside.  I have one other additional question  so that our record can be clear. Perhaps this has already been stated. As I  understand it, under the current state  of the law, the situation that the State  Department has determined  is  that  when the CPA goes out of existence on  the 30th, the inspector general goes out  of existence with them. As I understand it, the State Department would  like to take the $65 million in appropriated funds remaining in the CPA inspector general’s account and apply it  to some other purpose in that kind of  oversight.  Is that the understanding of the Senator?  ",2004
1164,94,2004-06-21,Mr. FEINGOLD.,"  I  am  concerned.  What the State Department proposes  to do here is, instead of continuing the  independent  inspector  general  who  would have the ability to report both  to the Defense Department and the  State Department—what the State Department partly wants to do is simply  subsume this function within its normal inspector general and reinventing  the wheel, which is not what we should  be doing at this point. But I do believe  the Senator  has  characterized  correctly what we have been  told  the  State Department would prefer to do  here.  ",2004
1165,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.,  It  is also my understanding that the CPA inspector general has about 40 auditors and investigators  in Iraq—that the State Department apparently does not have  plans to establish an  inspector general’s office of any size in Iraq. Is that  understanding correct as  far as the  Senator knows?  ,2004
1166,94,2004-06-21,Mr. FEINGOLD., I do know that the  State Department  certainly  doesn’t  have people on the ground. It is definitely the case that the inspector general  for the CPA has people on the  ground—substantial  staff working—I  believe 80 people.  Let me check that.  ,2004
1167,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, we have  provided  in  the  supplemental  bill  which was enacted last year $18 billion  in a special fund for the reconstruction  of Iraq, and created an inspector general, giving that inspector general responsibility for auditing the expenditure of these funds. We appropriated  money for that inspector general’s activities. It seems to me the Senator  from Wisconsin, as he so  frequently  does, put his finger on a very important accountability issue to make sure  the  taxpayers’  funds  are  properly  spent.  This is a huge expenditure of American taxpayers’ funds. We have to find  a way—and I think the Senator from  Wisconsin has identified the path—that  we can continue this function in a way  to protect the taxpayers’ funds.  I congratulate the Senator for this  amendment, and I ask to be added as a  cosponsor.  ",2004

1169,94,2004-06-21,Mr. FEINGOLD.," I thank the Senator  from Michigan.  I misspoke when I said 80 staff members. There are 60 staff members at this  point, including 20 auditors and investigators in Iraq.  The point the Senator from Michigan  has already made is that the State Department  itself  indicates they would  have to start  from ground zero and  staff up for this. We have excellent people already conducting a number of audits, and they are on the ground. It  would not make sense to do it.  I am delighted the distinguished Senator from Michigan is a cosponsor. I  look forward to further debate.  ",2004
1170,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN., I have no objection to  the amendment being laid aside for the  purpose the chairman has  indicated.  That is perfectly fine.  ,2004
1171,94,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," I thank my colleague.  Now, after the votes now scheduled  to start momentarily, it would be our  hope—I hope we share this—that you  could bring up  this very  important  amendment you have on missile defense and that it could be debated immediately following this vote. Debate  might not be concluded tonight, but at  least we can cover a significant portion  of it. Am I correct?  ",2004
1172,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," The amendment does relate  to homeland  security needs  to  fissile material security and to missile  defense all in one amendment. I am  happy to begin the debate tonight, but  I do not want to complete the debate  tonight given the fact the vote is tomorrow.  ",2004
1173,94,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," The Senator made  that clear. So we begin debate right  after that for such period of time as  the  Members  involved  debate—of  course you, the presenter, I would be in  opposition, and I am planning to have  one or two others from my side in opposition—and  that  could  consume,  would the Senator estimate, maybe an  hour, an hour and 20 minutes?  ",2004
1174,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," Depending on how many  people are on the other side of the  issue, it could be that long.  ",2004
1175,94,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," I thank the Senator.  I am wondering, I will inquire whether or not we could go ahead and start  the votes and use that time productively.  Mr. President, I now understand that  is not  feasible because Members are  travelling to the Senate from considerable distances.  ",2004
1176,94,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," In addition, I believe one  of the sponsors of the amendment may  be on his way here and perhaps could  use the few minutes that have been allocated.  ",2004

1188,94,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I will  divide such time as I have. I believe it  is 2 minutes. I will take 1 minute and  give the Senator a minute.  We had a very good debate. It involves an extremely sensitive subject,  the handling of the remains of those  who die or perish one way or another in  these theaters of conflict as they are  brought to the United States.  The amendment in the second degree  is drawn to preserve the most important priority, and that is the privacy of  the families. It is, therefore, my position that the better course of action  for the Senate is to go with the amendment in the second degree which is before all parties tonight and not open  this matter to great scrutiny by the  press, as does the underlying amendment in the first degree.  I yield the floor.  ",2004
1189,94,2004-06-21,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I rise to  explain why I cannot support either  the Warner or the Lautenberg amendment regarding the return of the remains of military personnel to Dover  Air Force Base.  The Warner amendment was an endorsement of the current policy, which  prohibits any news coverage. The Lautenberg amendment would allow  for  news coverage in all cases. I do not believe either approach is correct.  VerDate May 21 2004  02:40 Jun 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21JN6.066 S21PT1 ",2004

1192,101,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," I think it would be easier  to not modify it. That is not my plan  at the moment. I don’t think it will be  in the morning. But I would not even  seek  to modify  it  in a way which  changes its character, nor would I ask  for the right to do so.  ",2004
1193,101,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," I thank my colleague.  Madam President, our distinguished  colleague from Arizona has waited a  very  long time. Consequently,  I am  going to yield the manager’s slot here  to my good friend who will do an able  job.  ",2004
1194,101,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," If the Senator from Arizona will yield for one inquiry, I have  to leave the floor for a couple of moments.  Is  it  the Senator’s understanding  that after Senator KYLhas completed  there are no more speakers? After Senator KYL has completed  this  statement, there are no more speakers?  ",2004
1195,101,2004-06-21,Mr. WARNER.," That is correct.  Before the Senator leaves, perhaps to  acquaint our colleagues about what we  hope to achieve tomorrow morning, I  hope we  could  include  the Dayton  amendment and address it in the morning. Could the Senator consider that?  ",2004
1196,101,2004-06-21,Mr. LEVIN., The current unanimous  consent provides after an hour debate  on my amendment we would vote on  my amendment with no  intervening  first-degree or  second-degree amendments.  ,2004

1207,101,2004-06-21,Mr. KYL.," Madam President, I appreciate the chairman of the committee  yielding time for me to respond to the  amendment of our colleague, the Senator from Michigan. I will respond directly to some of the last points the  Senator made as I get further into my  remarks.  I begin by simply describing first of  all the essence of this amendment and  why it must be opposed. It would cut  after  the  $515.5 million from the Missile Defense  Program. That is over $1⁄2 billion. It  adds that funding to a variety of other  programs, all of which are adequately  funded. We have added funding to some  of them, and in some cases we could  not even spend the money that would  be allocated. I will get into those matters later.  Let me begin by discussing the harm  that would be done to the Missile Defense Program—which we have all committed to pursuing under the Clinton  administration—as  a  result  of  the  adoption of the Levin amendment.  Specifically, as he described it, the  amendment cuts funding for additional  ground-based  interceptors. These are  missiles that go into the ground, primarily into the State of the Presiding  Officer. This is the heart of our ground-  based missile defense system.  The missile defense opponents contend we are spending too much money  on a system that has not yet been proven to work, and they  further claim  that deployment is premature because,  as the Senator from Michigan argued,  operationally realistic testing has not  been completed, and the administration, he contends,  is not complying  with U.S. acquisition laws that require  such operational testing and evaluation.  We  are  complying with  the  law.  There is no question about that. It appears that the objective critics want to  achieve in demanding the missile defense system be operationally tested  before deployment is actually to halt  the program altogether. I will explain  why.  The bottom line is we need the interceptors that would be eliminated as a  result of eliminating this spending. We  need them to do the very tests our critics are demanding be done. In other  words, it is a Catch-22: You have to do  operational  testing, but we are not  going to give you the money to get the  missiles to do the testing. That makes  no sense.  Moreover, by adding these missiles to  the first 20 that will be purchased, we  have an additional capability to actually defend ourselves. I know that is  troublesome to some, that we would  actually be able to defend ourselves in  the event that a nation accidentally  launched a missile defense at us—and  there are at least three or four countries today that could do that—or, God  forbid, a country deliberately launched  a missile defense at us.  So these missiles not only are available for testing but also would actually  be able to defend the country for the  first time since Ronald Reagan in 1983  announced our intention to work on a  missile defense system. At that time,  he said it could take decades, but I  don’t  think he anticipated  that we  would research it to death; in other  words, that we would be willing to  spend more and more and more money  but never, as they say in the military,  bend metal; in other words, never actually produce the product that would  VerDate May 21 2004  04:14 Jun 22, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A21JN6.023 S21PT1 ",2004
1208,108,2004-06-21,Mr. CARPER.," Madam President,  I  pay tribute today to Alan Milbauer  upon his retirement as vice president  of public affairs for AstraZeneca. His  dedication has won him the respect of  coworkers and friends alike, along with  the gratitude of many in our State. He  has been, and remains, a trusted friend.  A native of Brooklyn, NY, Alan was  born on August 30, 1943, to Francis and  Irving Milbauer. He received his early  education in Brooklyn and went on to  earn degrees in pharmacy and law at  the University of Connecticut in 1965  and 1968, respectively.  Alan has spent most of his career in  the pharmaceutical  industry,  except  for a brief experience in the field of  consumer  marketing  research.  He  began his industry experience as attorney for the Pharmaceuticals Research  and  Manufacturers  of  America,  PhRMA, before coming  to Delaware  and joining Zeneca Pharmaceuticals—  then Atlas Chemicals—in 1969. In 1976,  he was appointed director of regulatory  affairs. He became vice president of  planning in 1985 and vice president of  marketing in 1991. Prior to the merger  of Astra and Zeneca, Alan served as  vice president of external affairs for  Zeneca Pharmaceuticals.  As a member of the U.S. AstraZeneca  leadership team, Alan’s responsibilities  include Federal and State government  affairs, corporate external communications, public relations and ally development, corporate and community affairs, and public policy. As a major  international healthcare business engaged  in the research, development,  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare  services,  Alan has provided  strong  leadership  and served as a role model to many.  According to friends, he has been described as  the  ‘‘conscience’’  for  the  company. He has long sought to ensure  that AstraZeneca was mindful of its  corporate responsibility to the community. Alan brought the human side to  the corporate world. He also played a  role  in helping bring AstraZeneca’s  United States headquarters to Delaware during my years as Governor.  Alan serves as a board director for  the Delaware Theatre Company, Delaware Public Policy Institute, and is a  trustee  of  the  University  of  the  Sciences in Philadelphia. He is also a  member of the board of directors of the  Vox Medical Center for Patient Education and Health Literacy, and is a  member of the Connecticut Bar. Alan’s  leisure  interests  include travel, theater, reading, and playing golf.  Alan and his wife of 37 years, Nancy,  live  in Wilmington, DE. They have  three  children, Karen, Stephen  and  Jennifer, and two grandchildren, twins  Jacob and Rachel.  Through Alan’s efforts, he has made  a real difference in the lives of thousands of individuals and enhanced the  quality of life for our State. Upon his  retirement, he will leave behind a legacy of commitment to public service  for both his children and grandchildren  and for others to follow. I thank him  for the friendship that we share, and I  congratulate him on a remarkable and  distinguished career. I wish him and  his family only the very best in all  that lies ahead for each of them.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 1:24 p.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the House has passed  the following bills, in which it requests  the concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 4567.

JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 18, 2004  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 4567) making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes:  ",2004
1212,122,2004-06-21,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the Roybal-Allard amendment  to  the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. This amendment stops  the privatization of nearly 1,500  employees that are critical to our Nation’s security.  The American people depend on these federal employees  to process,  investigate, and  adjudicate applications  for  immigration rights  and benefits in a timely and thorough manner.  They also weed out frivolous and fraudulent  applications and identify criminals and terrorists attempting to abuse the process. These  federal employees perform background checks  and search classified databases to investigate  people that want to enter our country.  Why do we want an unaccountable and low-  bid contractor to have the power to allow another 9–11 by cutting corners or not reading  all the background? We cannot allow the profit  margin to exist in our commitment to homeland security! Why did we  federalize airport  security if we are going to fire the federal employees that prevent terrorists from getting into  our country?  Another important reason why we need to  stop privatization of  these employees  is because immigrants and their families depend on  them to navigate through the complex maze of  immigration laws and regulations. Immigration  Information Officers, for instance, are the last  remaining federal employees that help immigrants with legal advice. The toll free phone  line, since  it was privatized, has simply become a phone  line  that  reads out  internet  based information. It would be hypocritical to  punish immigrants for minor mistakes in their  immigration, but deny  them  the  legal advice  necessary to comply with the law.  For the security of our Nation and to ensure  immigrants get sound  legal assistance, we  must prevent the privatization of Immigration  Information Officers, Contract Representatives,  and Investigative Analysts.  I urge my colleagues to support the Roybal-  Allard amendment.  A SALUTE TO MEDAL OF HONOR  RECIPIENT WESLEY FOX  HON. FRANK R. WOLF  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 21, 2004  ",2004
1213,122,2004-06-21,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure  today to recognize the outstanding service of  Colonel Wesley Fox, USMC (retired), of Front  Royal, Virginia. Colonel Fox was one of only  five Marines to receive the Medal of Honor for  their valiant heroism during Operation Dewey  Canyon in Vietnam and he was the only one  who survived to wear it. A bronze plaque will  be placed in the Warren County Courthouse  on July 7 honoring Colonel Fox.  Raised in Front Royal with ambitions toward  farming, Colonel Fox followed his cousins into  the armed services at the onset of the Korean  War. At the age of 18 he was thrust into intense  fighting after only  five months  in  the  U.S. Marine Corps. Just nine months later, he  was carried off  the  field of battle due  to  wounds that would alter his life plan. He would  remain in the Marine Corps and over the following 16 years he worked his way through all  the enlisted ranks to first sergeant.  Instead of taking the more conventional path  of retirement, Colonel Fox chose to begin the  climb through the officers’ ranks. His tour of  duty took him again to the battlefield of Vietnam as a first lieutenant. In Operation Dewey  Canyon he led his 1st Battalion 9th Marines,  called  the  ‘‘Walking Dead.’’ Despite  losing  three quarters of his men and receiving several wounds, Colonel Fox continued  to valiantly lead his troops. By the end of the war  he would be awarded the Medal of Honor by  President Nixon and would rise to the rank of  captain.  Forced to retire at age 62 after an unprecedented 43 years of service, Colonel Fox continued to serve his country working with the  Corps of Cadets at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He had the unique distinction of working  his way  through every  rank  from private  to  colonel. Colonel Fox  is a member of  the  United States Marine Corps Hall of Heroes.  Front Royal has the distinction of being the  only town in the United States that has produced two Medal of Honor recipients. It is my  honor and privilege to salute Colonel Fox and  extend gratitude and congratulations to him as  our country did 33 years ago with our Nation’s  highest award for military heroism. We say to  him, ‘‘Semper Fi!’’  f  A PROCLAMATION THANKING SPECIALIST FIRST CLASS LORI ANN  PIESTEWA FOR HER SERVICE TO  OUR COUNTRY  HON. ROBERT W.

1216,6,2004-06-25,Ms. LOFGREN.," Mr. Speaker, the sad  tale of our energy rip-off in the western  United States is really before us today.  We started out reacting in a bipartisan  way, but, in reviewing the history, I  note that after House Republicans met  with the Vice President on May 1, 2001,  that bipartisan effort did stall.  We have tried for 4 years to get results. In June, 2001, the California delegation asked for amendments to H.R.  2246; and the Committee on Rules refused  to  allow  those  amendments  which would provide a refund for unjust and unreasonable rates.  In July, 2001, amendments were offered in the markup in the Committee  on Energy and Commerce; and Republicans refused to allow the requirement  of refunds in overcharges.  In August of 2001, the Committee on  Rules  refused  to make  in order an  amendment to require refunds of overcharges.  In June of 2002, the GAO report indicated that the FERC was really not  doing the job, but Congress and the administration did nothing about it.  In April, 2003, the effort was made  again through H.R. 6 to refund all unjust and unreasonable  charges, but,  again, we were blocked in that effort.  Finally, in May, 2004, Californians,  including  the attorney general,  the  chief  law enforcement officer of the  State of California, filed a lawsuit to  try and get the law followed.  Now, what is the problem here? We  had energy manipulation. We had a  theft. California was a crime victim.  When  there was  a  fire,  they were  quoted as saying,  ‘‘burn, baby, burn,  that is a beautiful thing,’’ the trader  said about the massive fire; and they  also said he is just F-ing California,  meaning he steals money from California to the tune of about a million.  Mr. Speaker, we need to do something about this. Yesterday, we asked  that the Eshoo amendment be made in  order so we could get the refunds and  relief that citizens in the West are due.

1218,20,2004-06-25,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY) for yielding me this time.  While we do not agree on the issue  that I will be speaking on, he is a very  good friend and a very good Member of  Congress, and I appreciate his courtesy  today.  I would like to begin by thanking the  Committee on Rules for not allowing  language  that would  have  allowed  budget gimmicks to pay for the Yucca  Mountain Project.  I strongly oppose funding for the proposed Yucca Mountain Waste Repository. There is no single greater threat  to the health and safety of Southern  Nevada residents than the Bush administration’s plan to dump high-level nuclear waste in the Silver State. The  Nuclear  Waste  Technical  Review  Board, not a friend of the State of Nevada, has said that there is no question  that canisters stored in Yucca Mountain will corrode, allowing deadly nuclear waste to escape and contaminate  water supplies.  Listen to the language of the Nuclear  Waste Technical Review Board. They  said the canisters will leak and deposit  thousands of tons of radioactivity into  the groundwater at Yucca Mountain.  Decades  of  scientific  study  have  failed to answer even the most fundamental questions about Yucca Mountain’s  ability  to  withstand  earthquakes, volcanic activity, and now perhaps more immediate coordinated terrorist assault.  No plans have been put in place to  address the risks that will be created  by thousands of shipments of nuclear  waste,  traveling  past  schools,  hospitals, churches, and through communities across 43 States in this country,  across hundreds, literally hundreds, of  congressional districts, to be buried in  a hole in the Nevada desert. One terrorist strike or accident involving a  load of high-level nuclear waste could  seriously  injure or kill those  living  nearby and cause millions of dollars of  environmental damage.  Who will pay for this damage? Who  will pay for the loss of property? Who  will pay for the environmental damage? Who will pay to clean up the spill?  Who will pay for the loss of life?  Fire  and  police  departments  are  unequipped and untrained to deal with  the  hazards  presented  by  nuclear  waste, and no study has been completed to date on the vulnerability of  shipments to a 9–11 terrorist-type attack.  I would also remind my colleagues  that despite the administration’s approval of Yucca Mountain, a license to  construct the repository has yet to be  issued, and with close to 200 scientific  and  technical  questions  left  unanswered, the project is in real danger of  collapsing as a result of a long list of  problems that have been identified and  remain uncorrected.  And if the Members want to have a  chilling conversation, I invite them to  speak  to  the  representatives of  the  GAO, who did an exhaustive 10-month  study and determined that there are  over 200 remaining scientific and technical problems to work out before this  project can be approved.  The State of Nevada has filed numerous lawsuits that are now pending in  federal court which raise serious questions about the legality of DOE’s design for the repository.  b1100  It is sloppy science. The State of Nevada would also  like to recover the  oversight  funding  stripped  from  the  State of Nevada. So we do not even  have the money to protect our own  people.  Rather than waste one more cent on  this  dangerous  and  ill-conceived  project,  it  is time that we put the  health and  safety of all Americans  above the profits of the nuclear industry. Transporting nuclear waste  to  Yucca Mountain will require decades of  shipments that will leave our communities vulnerable to accident and will  provide inviting targets for would-be  terrorists.  It is beyond comprehension that the  Members of this body would accept  this. I urge Members on both sides of  the aisle to reconsider their position  and vote against this ridiculous, expensive, dangerous project.  ",2004

First, however, I want to offer my thanks to the  chairman and the ranking member for  their work and leadership on this bill.  As many of my colleagues who have  DOE facilities in their district know,  there is a significant backlog of applications  for employee security clearances, especially  those known as Q  clearances. Many qualified and capable  trade workers are unable to start work  on a timely basis or sometimes are not  able to work for the national laboratories at all. That means the jobs important for our national security are  not getting done. It also means that  citizens living near the national laboratories are not afforded the economic  opportunities  that  should  be made  available to them.  Although I recognize the difficulties  the investigative agencies face in processing security clearances in light of  VerDate May 21 2004  06:43 Jun 26, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JN7.030 H25PT1 ",2004
1220,27,2004-06-25,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today in support of H.R. 4614, the Fiscal Year  2005 Energy and Water Appropriation’s bill.  First, let me thank the distinguished Chairman of this Committee, DAVEHOBSON, for this  work in crafting this legislation. He and ranking  member PETEVISCLOSKYhave drafted an excellent bill that focuses on our national priorities.  Mr. Chairman, our country continues to benefit from advances in science, technology and  engineering. We’ve discovered  the potential  for  fusion energy, advanced  renewable energy, and improved energy efficiency. Through  cutting research and the development of these  programs at the U.S. Department of Energy,  we are rapidly advancing our scientific knowledge.  Mr. Chairman, I have long supported funding for renewable energy sources. The Committee’s investment of $343 million in renewable energy resources will be integral to creating alternative energy solutions for our nation. The Department of Energy  is pursuing  other new technologies to meet future energy  and environmental needs. These technologies  will change how we use and produce energy.  The DOE, with  this Committee’s support,  is  pursuing a path  towards making affordable,  safe zero emission fuel cell vehicles.  I am pleased that year after year this Committee continues  to  recognize  the  incredible  potential of fusion energy by providing a $12  million dollar increase in funding for a total of  $276 million in funding for the program—which  will advance the vital work of the domestic fusion community  to prosper at sites such as  New Jersey’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.  The Committee also continues  to address  electricity reliability, of special  importance  to  the East Coast with last summer’s blackout.  We’ve  included  funds  for  transmission  reliability, research and development.  Since 1775 when the Continental Congress  authorized  the  first Chief Engineer—whose  first task it was to build fortifications near Boston at Bunker Hill—the Army Corps of Engineers has grown to be the world’s largest public engineering, design and construction management agency.  The Army Corps keeps our waterways open  for business, prevents our communities from  flooding and our beaches from eroding.  In New Jersey alone, the Army Corps budget helps keep the 127 miles of New Jersey  coastline open  to visitors  from across  the  country. Serving as one of New  Jersey’s  greatest attractions, our beaches generate  over 30 billion dollars for our state’s economy  each year, while providing over 800,000 people with jobs.  One of  the most  important Army Corps  projects is the Port of New York and New Jersey Harbor Deepening. For the second year in  a row, President Bush’s budget message recognized the dredging of this port as a national  priority and called for it to be one of five national navigational projects.  It goes without saying that projects like the  Port drive our national economy it is a national  secret asset. As the largest port in the northeast and a leading job center for the New Jersey/New York Metropolitan area, we must  continue to focus our efforts on deepening its  major navigation channels so that the port is  able to meet the 21st Century needs of our  economy.  The importance of the Army Corps budget is  not limited to just navigational projects. In an  effort to protect New Jerseyans, their homes,  and their businesses from the destruction and  devastation of flooding, this bill also provides  the  framework and  the  funding  to purchase  wetlands  for natural storage areas, and  to  work with  the  local governments  in across  northern New Jersey to develop long-term solutions to re-occurring floods. In New Jersey  this means  that projects  like  the  Jackson  Brook Flood Control project in my own district  and the dredging of the Hudson Raritan Estuary Lower Passaic River Restoration, among  several other critical  local projects have  the  funding to remain on track.  Mr. Chairman,  for all of  these  reasons,  I  urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.  ",2004
1221,27,2004-06-25,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  strong support of the Energy and Water bill. I  want to commend Chairman HOBSONand the  ranking member, Mr. VISCLOSKY, for producing  a bill that should enjoy the support of every  single member of  this chamber.  I am  impressed by the way in which Chairman HOBand Mr. VISCLOSKYworked  together  to  produce  the Energy and Water bill and you  both should be congratulated  for  the bi-partisan way in which you wrote this bill.  This bill is certainly a good bill for my home  state of Idaho—and I want to thank the committee for that. But more importantly, this is a  good bill for the nation as a whole. It addresses national and international needs by improving our nation’s water infrastructure, expanding our efforts to produce more energy for a  growing economy, and protecting nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists.  I fully support the Subcommittee’s efforts to  demand some accountability  from  the DOE  and the Russians regarding our efforts to help  secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet  Union.  Spending money in Russia and the former  Soviet Union to locate, identify and secure nuclear materials is clearly in our own national  interest as well as the interests of the rest of  the world. However, as  I have  repeatedly  pointed out to Russian officials, I cannot explain to my constituents why we spend American taxpayers’ money to secure nuclear materials in Russia while at the same time Russia is planning to cooperate with Iran in their  SON VerDate May 21 2004  04:57 Jun 26, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A25JN7.047 H25PT1 ",2004

It establishes a deadline for completing the general reevaluation report  for the Mill Creek, Ohio, project and  adds a planning requirement. This constitutes  legislating on an appropriations bill in violation of House rules.  The CHAIRMAN. Does  any  other  Member wish to be heard on the point  of order? If not, the Chair will rule.  The Chair finds that this provision  includes language imparting direction  to the Secretary of the Army. The provision, therefore, constitutes  legislation under clause 2 of rule XXI.

1223,34,2004-06-25,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Chairman, I raise  a point of order against section 108.  This provision violates clause 2 of rule  XXI.  It authorizes the Secretary to  provide certain credit to the non-Federal sponsor  for the project at Ashtabula River, Ohio. It, therefore, constitutes  legislating on an appropriations bill in violation of House rules.  The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member  wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair  finds this provision  includes language imparting direction to  the Secretary of the Army.

It directs the Corps of Engineers  to proceed to the design phase of the  Central Riverfront Project on the Ohio  riverfront in Cincinnati. This, therefore, constitutes legislating on an appropriations bill in violation of House  rules.  The CHAIRMAN. Does  any  other  Member wish to address the point of  order? If not, the Chair is prepared to  rule.  The Chair  finds this provision  includes language imparting direction to  the Secretary of the Army. The provision of the legislation is in violation of  clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order  is  sustained,  and  the  provision  is  stricken from the bill.  ",2004
1225,34,2004-06-25,Mr. DUNCAN.," Finally, Mr. Chairman, once again, on behalf of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure  and  the  gentleman  from  Alaska  (Chairman YOUNG), I raise a  point of order against section 110. Mr.  Chairman, this section violates clause  I  2 of rule XXI. It prohibits amounts in  the Corps of Engineers revolving fund  from being used  for certain maintenance work on corps dredges. It limits  the use of funds not made available in  this bill and, therefore, constitutes legislating on an appropriations bill  in  violation of House rules.  The CHAIRMAN. Does  any  other  Member wish to address the point of  order? If not, the Chair is prepared to  rule.  The Chair  finds this provision addresses funds and other acts. The provision, therefore, constitutes legislation  in violation of clause 2, rule XXI. The  point of order is sustained. The provision is stricken from the bill.  Are there any amendments to this  portion of the bill?  ",2004
1226,34,2004-06-25,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like today to  rise in strong support for what the gentleman  from Wisconsin was  so eloquently up here speaking about before,  the Environmental Management Program.  This is a program that provides critical resources to keep the Mississippi  River healthy and enjoyable for all of  our citizens. The Mississippi River is a  working river, and it is a river, which,  when  navigation  takes  place  and  projects by the Army Corps are put in  effect  for  flood control projects, we  quite often find ourselves with unintended  consequences  to  the  river’s  habitat.  Without additional funding, the river  habitat will continue to be lost and  hundreds of species that depend upon  the health of the river will struggle to  survive, but it is not just fish and wildlife at stake. Millions of visitors spend  annually billions of dollars on recreating along the Mississippi-Illinois rivers supporting thousands of jobs.  The Mississippi River is also a source  of drinking water for millions of Americans. The Environmental Management  Program is the Nation’s premier large-  river monitoring and restoration program. It is a model for interagency and  interstate cooperation on an equal system level national resources management.  This  is a very  important management program; and as the committee  moves forward, I would encourage it to  look for any additional funding dollars.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:  TITLE III  DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY  ENERGY PROGRAMS  ENERGYSUPPLY  For Department of Energy expenses including the purchase, construction, and acquisition of plant and capital equipment, and  other expenses necessary for energy supply  activities in carrying out the purposes of the  Department of Energy Organization Act (42  U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), including the acquisition  or condemnation of any real property or any  facility or for plant or facility acquisition,  construction, or expansion, and the purchase  of not to exceed 9 passenger motor vehicles  for replacement only, and one ambulance,  $817,126,000, to remain available until expended.

1228,34,2004-06-25,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent that debate on this  amendment  and  any  amendments  thereto be limited to 24 minutes to be  equally divided and controlled by the  proponent and myself, the opponent.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Ohio?  There was no objection.  The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. SANDERS) is recognized for 12 minutes.  ",2004
1229,34,2004-06-25,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.  Chairman,  let me  begin  by  thanking  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Chairman HOBSON) and the gentleman  from Indiana  (Ranking Member VISCLOSKY) for all of their hard work on  this important legislation.  The amendment that I am offering is  cosponsored by  the gentleman  from  New York (Mr. HINCHEY) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).  Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals,  in  fact, with one of  the  important  issues of our time, and that is, whether  the United States Government will  take the bold step to break our dependency on fossil fuels, break our dependency on nuclear power and move forward as aggressively as we can into the  new world of safe, clean, cost-effective,  sustainable energy.  The truth is that we have made some  progress in recent years, but the truth  also is that we have a long, long way to  go; and this amendment will help us  move in that direction.  Mr. Chairman, specifically, the legislative intent of this amendment is to  increase funding for renewable energy  programs such as solar energy, wind,  biomass,  clean  hydrogen,  and  geothermal by $30 million, to be offset by  a decrease of $30 million in funding for  the nuclear weapons advance simulation and computing program  in the  weapons activities budget. That offset,  by the way, is a decrease of less than 5  percent for this program and a tiny  fraction of the $6.5 billion for weapons  that are funded in this bill.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  would bolster critical research and development so that we can deliver unlimited clean energy for generations to  come.

1230,41,2004-06-25,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 7  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. OSE).  ",2004
1231,41,2004-06-25,Mr. OSE.," Mr. Chairman, we talked  about this a little earlier today. I was  listening to the minority leader’s comments very carefully in my office, and  I ran over here. I apologize for being a  little short of breath.  I  just want to refresh everybody’s  memory about what happened in 2000  and 2001 and to point out the empirical  fact that there have been no statewide  blackouts or brownouts in California  since,  frankly,  the Republican-dominated FERC got put into place.  First of all, the law was very clear.  When the previous administration was  in control, these same complaints were  uttered,  the  same  concerns  were  brought to the floor, and the same response was given by FERC down to the  last period or punctuation mark. You  got no more response from the FERC  under Clinton-Gore than you are complaining about today. The reason  is  that the law is clear. If you are unhappy about that, change the law.  The prohibition of  funds that the  gentlewoman  is asking  for here will  not do one thing to create another  megawatt of power for California. It  will not do a single thing to help us replace the carbon-based, high-polluting  facilities that exist in California today  with much more efficient and less adverse  impact to the environment. It  does not do a single thing to reduce the  pricing that the California PUC board  regulates which is dominated by appointees  of  former Governor Gray  Davis. It does not do a single thing to  solve  the problem on  forward  contracting for investor-owned utilities.  I repeat my invitation. I said Horatio  earlier. I meant Hannibal. Rather than  acting as Hannibal at the gates to the  valley of solutions, stopping us from  entering, come over and join us. Help  us put in place the infrastructure and  the technology that California  is so  good at creating. Help us put that in  place to create the megawatts of power  that our people need and our factories  depend upon. Help us bring power to  the peninsula of San Francisco which  is probably one of the most difficult  places to get power to in the entire  United States. Help us eliminate the  variability in power that Santa Clara  depends upon. Help us bring power to  our food processors up and down the  State where agriculture remains the  largest  industry. Abandon this Hannibal at the gates concept and come  over here and help us. Instead of haranguing us about past history and attempting to rewrite it, come over here  and propose your solutions.  This is not a witch-hunt. It should  not be a witch-hunt. The response you  are getting today is the same response  you got under Clinton-Gore. The law is  very clear about what FERC’s prerogatives are. So come over here and help  us find solutions. Help us create the  technology and put it in place that allows us to create power at less adverse  impact to our environment.  I know you are environmentalists. I  know you are, because I watch you  very carefully. One of my models on  environmental issues is the gentleman  from California (Mr. GEORGEMILLER),  one of your fine, outstanding Members  and one of your leaders. Help us put  that  technology  in place and make  California’s  environment  even more  suitable for our use. I know that PG&E  is based in San Francisco. They have  just gone through a horrendous bankruptcy. I know the gentlewoman as the  minority leader is very curious about  the outcome.  I am trying to  find solutions. We  need to work together on this.  ",2004
1232,41,2004-06-25,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr.  Chairman, will  the  gentleman  yield?  ",2004
1233,41,2004-06-25,Mr. OSE., I yield to the gentleman  from California.  ,2004
1234,41,2004-06-25,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  I thank the gentleman  for his comments, and I thank the gentleman for  his work. But as the gentleman knows,  we have been working on some of those  solutions. As the gentleman knows, I  have been  involved  in the plants  in  Yolo County and Solano County and  Contra Costa County where we have  brought on new generation, clean generation, site-based generation, replacing old, inefficient production of energy. We are working on a cable system  now to go under the bay to put power  from the East Bay into the South Bay,  into San Francisco.  b 1230  We are working on more efficient  pipelines to move fuel around Northern  California. So I mean I think clearly  those are there.  This amendment is a little different.  This is about people who stole money.  This is not about people who are building power plants. This is about people  who took power out of service. Knowing that if they removed 1 or 2 percent  of the power, they would drive up their  revenues by hundreds of percent.  ",2004
1235,41,2004-06-25,Mr. OSE.," Madam Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman,  who is a neighbor of mine, because all  of those are good ideas. And to the extent that we have bad actors that have  manipulated the system, we are going  to get at it because the chairman is  going to probably accept this amendment.  But the point is that we cannot sit  here flailing away at the past history.  We have to come to a solution, and the  solution is along the lines that you  would otherwise advocate for and advocated for when President Clinton was  here and Vice President Gore was here  and advocated for when Governor Davis  was in office and now that he is not and  those people are gone, you are opposing  them. We want to get at the bad actors. There are two or three who manipulated the market. There is no question about it. And they did it to the  detriment of every single one of us who  lives in California. Every single one of  us.  Whether one lives in San Francisco  or Modesto or Santa Clara, every single  one of us suffered from that. But I ask  you to come over here and help us find  solutions on a bipartisan manner, on a  manner that does not attempt to rewrite history. History is history. It is  gone. It is done. It is over. Clinton is  gone. Davis is gone. There is no point  in pointing the finger. We know what  the facts are. Help us put in place the  facilities that give us power with the  least detriment to our environment,  that give us power at the lowest price,  that give our investor-owned utilities,  who employ thousands of people up and  down the State, who give our investor-  owned utilities the opportunity to forward contract because if they had the  opportunity to do that, to remove the  uncertainty on supply, the very same  thing that Governor Davis was asked  to do, that the PUC was asked to do,  that both declined to do, if we gave  them that power, we would not have to  VerDate May 21 2004  06:43 Jun 26, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JN7.069 H25PT1 ",2004

And I should tell the gentleman that  I have been out there and looked at  these tanks, and also, as the gentleman  spoke about last year, we made him a  promise we would take care of the unlined trenches, and I believe, as of yesterday, their record of decision is that  the citizens out there deserve this, and  I think it is going to go forward.

So any conclusion must be comprehensive and consistent nationwide.  ",2004

1246,55,2004-06-25,Mr. HOBSON.,  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.  ,2004
1247,55,2004-06-25,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman, I  appreciate the chairman’s willingness  to enter into a colloquy and to yield to  me on this issue. I would just say to  him that Missouri is downstream from  where I live.  Mr. Chairman,  I had authored an  amendment  to  this  legislation  that  would prohibit funds intended for use  for endangered species’ habitat restoration from being used by the Fish and  Wildlife Service  and State Departments of Natural Resources. I am not  pursuing this amendment because the  good gentleman from Ohio has agreed  the funding in this act should be used  for its intended purposes.  As the Members of this body may remember, every year the energy and  water development appropriations bill  brings to light the issues of the Missouri River, which flows along the border of the district I represent in western Iowa. In the ecosystem of the Missouri River, there are three endangered  species, the least tern, the piping plover, and the pallid sturgeon. A dire legal  situation involving regulation of the  Missouri River  flow has resulted  in  complex reg. issues that impact the entire Missouri River basin. A multiplicity  of  interests,  including  agriculture,  flood  control,  river  freight  transportation, electrical generation,  water, recreation, and the environment  have been impacted by decisions affecting the flow of the river.  Currently, the Army Corps of Engineers is working on a habitat restoration for the two birds and the fish that  have created such a problem for people  who need the river for economic reasons. As they have been working to reestablish this habitat, we have discovered some of the money that  is diverted to Fish and Wildlife and State  Departments of Natural Resources to  help with this effort is being used for  other purposes, such as duck habitat.  Mr. Chairman, my father took me to  the duck blind when I was two years  old. I have been going there ever since,  that is half a century or more, and I  can tell you there is no endangered species of ducks in my district. As much  as I like duck habitat, it should not be  at the expense of funds that are directed to priority habitat for endangered species, which can go a long ways  towards resolving this Missouri River  issue.  So not only do I care to see the issues  of the Missouri River resolved, as a responsible Member of this body, I also  believe it is our responsibility to stop  abuse  in  its tracks. My amendment  would have alleviated both of these  problems.  ",2004
1248,55,2004-06-25,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr.  Chairman,  reclaiming my time, I agree with the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) that  the purposes and intentions of this act  should be met. The funds appropriated  for endangered species habitat restoration on the Missouri River should be  used for those purposes.  As  the Army Corps of Engineers  works to that end, let us encourage the  Corps  to properly oversee  that  the  funds are being utilized for their purposes.  ",2004
1249,55,2004-06-25,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Mr. Chairman, if  the gentleman will continue to yield, I  thank the distinguished chairman for  his consideration of this issue.  ",2004
1250,55,2004-06-25,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word, and I seek this  time to enter into a colloquy with the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. PORTMAN).  ",2004

1253,55,2004-06-25,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  wanted  to  rise  to congratulate  the  chairman on balancing difficult competing  interests  in  this  legislation.  Once again, I think we will see on final  passage what a good job he has done.  But in particular, I want to thank  him very much for helping with regard  to our energy needs at the Port Smith  Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Once again,  he has provided the President’s request  and has been  instrumental  in being  sure that we have not only  jobs  in  southern Ohio but that the centrifuge  technology moves forward, which is so  critical to our Nation’s energy security.  So, again, I rise to congratulate the  chairman, and I look forward to working with him going into the future, and  congratulate  him  on  his  bill  and  strongly support it this afternoon.

1257,62,2004-06-25,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to spend a few minutes to talk  about some developments recently in  the country of Turkey, some of which  we celebrate, some of which we have  great concern about.  Let me first, by the way, extend my  condolences to victims of yesterday’s  terrorist bombings in Turkey and to  the families of the victims. Certainly  we want the perpetrators brought to  justice quickly.  But I rise to celebrate a small, but  very  important,  victory  for human  rights that took place last week. Four  human rights prisoners in Turkey were  released. Leyla Zana,  a  prominent  Kurdish advocate  for human  rights,  and her colleagues, Hatip Dicle, Slim  Sadak and Ornhan Dogan, were  released from prison following a June 9  appeals court ruling in their favor.  These were Kurdish citizens of Turkey. These were  citizens who were  elected by majority vote to the Turkish Parliament. These were Kurds who  had the nerve to speak their own native language, Kurdish, in the Turkish  Parliament; and  they were arrested  and sentenced to 15 years in prison.  Amnesty  International  declared  them prisoners of  conscience. They  have been there 10 years.  Leyla Zana was probably the best  known of the four prisoners. She was  the  first Kurdish woman elected  to  Turkey’s Parliament who openly and  proudly identified herself as a Kurd. In  fact, the European Parliament awarded  her a Sakharov Prize in 1995 for defending human rights.  I had the great pleasure of getting to  know her husband, Mayda, who traveled around the world to talk about the  injustice of his wife being in prison. I  spent time with her son Ronee who was  for a short time a student in Los Angeles. This was a whole family dedicated  to human rights for all, and especially  to the Kurdish minority who has been  denied them in Turkey.  The release of these prisoners of conscience was a result of international  pressure, and I want to thank the 21  Members of Congress who joined with  me in H. Res. 302 that called for the release of these four parliamentarians.  The Kurdish community in the United  States, as well as human rights advocates across the country, played an important role in gaining their release.  So we welcome the release of these  prisoners of  conscience, as well as  other reforms in Turkey, including the  introduction of public broadcasting in  minority languages. However, serious  human rights and repression of the  Kurds continue in Turkey.  From  June  8–10,  Human  Rights  Watch, Amnesty International, and the  International Federation  for Human  Rights  joined with Turkish human  rights groups in a joint delegation to  investigate the situation  in Turkey.  They heard continuing allegations of  torture and violations of freedom of expression, assembly, association,  religion, and the right to a fair trial. They  expressed concern about prisons, national minorities,  the  lack of  independent  investigations  into  human  rights violations, and internal displacement.  The State Department human rights  report, released just in February, also  found that serious human rights problems exist. The report says that security forces killed 43 people last year  and participated in widespread torture,  beatings, and other abuses. The Turkish Government continued to limit free  speech in the press and, in particular,  restricted expression by people sympathetic to Kurdish cultural or nationalist viewpoints.  So we are pleased at the release of  Leyla Zana and her colleagues, but we  are not placated by this good news. We  demand greater progress. The European Union should insist that Turkey  take greater  strides  to  improve  its  human rights record and treatment of  the Kurds before joining the European  Union. Turkey needs to realize that its  Kurdish citizens enrich  the country  rather than threaten it.  President Bush will visit Turkey for  a NATO summit next week. He should  use this opportunity to press for greater respect for human rights. I would  hope that he meets with Leyla Zana  and shows his respect for human rights  for the Kurdish minority in Turkey.  f  ",2004

They went on to cite a long string of  abuses and usurpations pursuing  invariably the same object of absolute  despotism,  and  claimed with  their  lives, their fortunes and their sacred  honor that it was their right and their  duty to throw off such government.  One independence day.  The other will take place for the first  time this coming Wednesday, not an  18th century colonial nation, but a 21th  century modern power in the Middle  East whose freedom is also being born  at this very hour in violent conflict,  aided by the armies of a liberty-loving  ally to throw off the despotism and  tyranny that has beset its people for  decades and of their freedom the people  of Iraq wrote these words in the preamble to their Constitution:  ‘‘The people of Iraq, striving to reclaim their freedom which was usurped  by the previous tyrannical regime, rejecting violence and coercion in all its  forms, and particularly when used as  instruments of governance, have determined that they shall hereafter remain  a free people governed under the rule of  law.’’  Two Independence Days: One, 228th  anniversary of ours on the 4th of July;  and the other, the first-ever Independence Day for a free and democratic Iraq  on a day that will live in history for  the people of that great nation as a day  of celebration, June 30, 2004.  b1530  Two independence days.

1264,69,2004-06-25,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding, and I would  recognize that the Governor of New  Mexico really put it in perspective before the 2003 session. He declared that  tax cuts create jobs, and the Democrats need to get over that and pass the  tax cuts. That was the tax cut in New  Mexico passed in 2003.  ",2004
1265,69,2004-06-25,Mr. DREIER.," If I can reclaim my  time just to remind my colleagues, the  Governor  of New Mexico  formerly  served in this House. He was elected to  this House one term after I was elected  here. It is Bill Richardson, who served  with great distinction as the Ambassador to the United Nations and the  Secretary of Energy, and I worked very  closely with him on global trade issues.  He is now the Governor of New Mexico  and has  talked about and put  into  place important tax cuts to stimulate  growth in your economy.  ",2004
1266,69,2004-06-25,Mr. PEARCE.," And he did stimulate  growth in the economy. At one point,  July of  last year, New Mexico was  number two  in  job growth. Keep  in  mind, they were like 43rd or 44th in per  capita income. So job growth that high  is tremendous.  The next thing that I would observe  is that since I graduated from college,  tax freedom day, that is the day which  we all work until to pay the taxes, tax  freedom day has always been in late  May, early June. And now, because of  the tax cuts we have given, tax freedom day this year occurred on April 11,  and I hear people telling me thank you.  A gentleman in Ruidoso, New Mexico, grabbed me the last time I was  there, shook my hand and said, ‘‘I have  six kids,’’ and he said, ‘‘I will tell you  that I saw the tax breaks in my paycheck.’’  Watson Trucking Supply in Hobbs,  New Mexico, are goods friends of mine;  I have known them throughout my career there in Hobbs. They were set to  lay off people before our tax cuts. They  had run completely out of manufacturing back orders, no new business;  they were set to lay off. The day that  we passed the tax and jobs bill here in  Congress, he got more back orders than  he had ever had, he had 2 years’ worth  of work laid out in front of them; and  instead of laying off people, they began  to hire people.  The potash mines  in New Mexico  have begun to hire because now the  potash market is lifting with the overall market.  The copper mines  in western New  Mexico, Phelps Dodge has put miners  back  to work  there mining copper.  They have told me in my office that if  they had regulatory certainty, that is  not to roll back regulations, but the  certainty that they would be able to  get the rules that are in place and keep  the rules that are in place, that they  would open a smelter and hire 600 people for very good, high-paying jobs in  an area that has just been decimated.  We have an MPC plant going into  New Mexico, only  the  second MPC  plant in the world; and that is going  into New Mexico. There are going to be  about 200 jobs there, all good, high-paying jobs.  I have seen in New Mexico the fact  that these tax cuts have really created  job opportunities, the  job growth  in  New Mexico continues to today, and I  appreciate the gentleman yielding time  to talk about these exact examples.  ",2004
1267,69,2004-06-25,Mr. DREIER.," Reclaiming my time, I  thank my friend for pointing to the  tremendous benefits that these reductions in the tax burden have had on the  economy of New Mexico; and, frankly,  they could take place in the economy  of Mexico, too, if we could encourage  that, and  that  is one of  the other  things. Global trade is a very important part of this component.  I  thought  before yielding  to my  friend from Indiana that I would take a  moment to juxtapose, as I was saying  earlier, the things that are being said  and the proposals that were offered  back in 1984, to what has taken place in  2004.  As we all know, 1984, like 2004, was a  Presidential  year.  The  incumbent  President, Ronald Reagan, had inherited a very troubled economy 4 years  earlier. We all spent a great deal of  time talking about that just a couple  of weeks ago as we were memorializing  Ronald Reagan. You  remember  the  terms that were used, the  fact that  President Carter had referred to our  Nation as being in a state of malaise.  We saw a tremendous, tremendous increase in the interest rates, we saw a  very high rate of inflation; and we saw,  frankly, a devastated economy  that  Ronald Reagan inherited.  But clearly, and I am very proud, I  was elected to the Congress the day  Ronald Reagan was elected President,  and I stood here in this well in May of  1981, before my colleagues were born,  and at that time when I stood here in  that well, we were able to cast the deciding vote with bipartisan support for,  first what was known  then as  the  Gramm-Latta budget package, which  reduced  by  17  percent  the  rate  of  growth of Federal spending. It did not  cut back Federal spending as much as  we all were trying to do, and we are  still working on that effort, but it did  reduce  the  rate of growth. Then  3  months  later,  in August of 1981, we  passed what was known as the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.  As we put those very, very important  job-creating  economic-growth-stimulating packages into place, we saw by  1984 that the economy had been turned  around through cutting taxes and by  empowering companies to become more  competitive, and tearing down the barriers, as I mentioned when I accidentally said Mexico as opposed to New  Mexico, tearing down the barriers to  the free flow of goods and services and  capital.  Yet inexplicably, the candidate ran a  campaign  in 1984 of economic  isolationism. He ran a campaign based on  pessimism about the present and the  future, and he called for America to retreat into its borders and restrict the  freedom of individuals to engage in the  global marketplace. We all know that  candidate was our  former colleague,  the  former Vice President  of  the  United States, Walter Mondale.  In that 1984 campaign, he said when  the American economy leads, the jobs  are here. The prosperity is here for our  children. But that is not what is happening today.  Again, this is Walter Mondale speaking in 1984. He said, ‘‘This is the worse  trade year in American history. Three  million of our  jobs have gone overseas.’’ That is what he said in 1984.  Speaking of the American companies  that were global leaders in fields from  manufacturing, to finance, to the burgeoning high-tech industry, which was  in its infancy in the 1980s, Walter Mondale said, ‘‘To big companies that send  our jobs overseas, my message is, we  need these jobs here at home, and our  country won’t help your business unless your business helps our country.’’  That is what Walter Mondale said as  a candidate challenging Ronald Reagan  back in 1984.  2004, Mr. Speaker, is a Presidential  election year. We have an incumbent  President who  inherited an economy  that was heading for recession, shedding jobs and reeling from a stock market whose bubble had burst. These circumstances were then compounded by  the worst terrorist attack in American  history, as I was saying, several high-  profile corporate scandals, and the uncertainty and anxiety of the ongoing  war on terror, including our challenge  in Iraq.  Again, President Bush, like Ronald  Reagan in the early 1980s, was able to  turn the economy around with an agenda of cutting taxes, improving the regulatory  environment  for U.S.  businesses, and knocking down barriers to  trade, both here and abroad.  Again, despite the tremendous success that these policies have met, the  challenging candidate, our colleague,  Senator KERRY, is running a campaign  based on raising taxes and reversing  our trade  liberalization agenda. The  Mondale quotes that I just shared with  our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, could easily be slipped into a JOHNKERRYcampaign speech, and they would be right  at home in the midst of that speech.  In fact, we know that KERRY’s whole  platform could well be called the Mondale  legacy campaign. JOHNKERRY’s  term for the heads of U.S. companies  that are global leaders, creating jobs,  investing in growing overseas markets,  is, as we all know, Benedict Arnold  VerDate May 21 2004  06:43 Jun 26, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K25JN7.134 H25PT1 ",2004
1268,83,2004-06-25,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, our  Nation cannot be the  ‘‘shining city  upon the hill’’ without the respect and  recognition  of  the  inalienable  personhood of every American from the  moment of conception until natural  death. Reagan  realized and declared  this. The Reagan Cultural Doctrine is  synonymous with the culture of life.  President Reagan’s commitment to the  culture of life was evident from the  first days of his Presidency.  In recent days, some have implicitly  questioned President Reagan’s  commitment to the inalienable personhood  of every American by suggesting that  destructive embryonic  stem cell  research should be conducted in President Reagan’s name. And here we are  not talking about adult stem cell research or umbilical cord blood which  are supported by virtually everybody  and are producing true results—here  we are talking strictly about destructive  embryonic  stem  cell  research  which results in the death of a young  human embryo after its conception.  To suggest that this should be conducted in President Reagan’s name is a  completely  contrary  view  of  the  Reagan Cultural Doctrine. It is a misappropriation  of President Reagan’s  legacy, and it is damaging to the culture of life that President Reagan was  so steadfast in defending. It is an assault on the Reagan Cultural Doctrine.  As former Reagan National Security  Adviser and Interior Secretary William  Clark noted in the New York Times recently,  Ronald Reagan’s record reveals that no  issue was of greater importance to him than  the dignity and sanctity of all human life.  ‘‘My administration is dedicated to the preservation of America as a free land,’’ he said  in 1983. ‘‘And there is no cause more important for preserving that freedom than affirming the transcendent right to  life of all  human beings, the right without which no  other rights have any meaning.’’ One of the  things he regretted most at the completion  of his Presidency in 1989, he told [William  Clark], was that politics and circumstances  had  prevented  him  from making more  progress in restoring protection for unborn  human life.  Continuing in his New York Times  piece, Clark then addressed Reagan’s  early  efforts  to  protect  innocent  human life through halting Federal efforts on destructive research involving  human embryos. Here we  find  that  President Reagan himself pushed  to  stop destructive human embryonic research.  Clark says:  Reagan consistently opposed federal support for the destruction of innocent human  life. After the charter expired for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s ethical advisory board—which in the 1970s supported destructive research on human embryos—he began a de facto ban on federal financing of embryo research that he held to  throughout his presidency.  I ask unanimous consent a copy of  William Clark’s June  11,  2004, New  York Times op-ed piece titled  ‘‘For  Reagan, All Life Was Sacred,’’ be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, June 11, 2004]  FORREAGAN, ALLLIFEWASSACRED  (By William P. Clark)  PASOROBLES, CALIF.—Ronald Reagan had  not passed from this life for 48 hours before  proponents of human embryonic stem-cell  research began to suggest that such ethically questionable scientific work should be  promoted under his name. But this cannot  honestly be done without ignoring President  Reagan’s own words and actions.  Ronald Reagan’s record reveals that no  issue was of greater importance to him than  the dignity and sanctity of all human life.  ‘‘My administration is dedicated to the preservation of America as a free land,’’ he said  in 1983. ‘‘And there is no cause more important for preserving that freedom than affirming the transcendent right to  life of all  human beings, the right without which no  other rights have any meaning.’’ One of the  things he regretted most at the completion  of his presidency in 1989, he told me, was  that politics and circumstances had prevented him from making more progress in  restoring protection for unborn human life.  Still, he did what he could. To criticize the  Roe v. Wade decision on its 10th anniversary  in 1983, he published his famous essay ‘‘Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation’’ in  The Human Life Review. ‘‘We cannot diminish the value of one category of human life—  the unborn—without diminishing the value  of all human life,’’ he wrote. He went on to  emphasize  ‘‘the  truth  of human  dignity  under God’’ and ‘‘respect for the sacred value  of human life.’’ Because modern science has  revealed the wonder of human development,  and modern medicine treats ‘‘the developing  human as a patient,’’ he declared, ‘‘the real  question today is not when human life begins, but, What is the value of human life?’’  In that essay, he expressly encouraged continued  support  for  the  ‘‘Sanctity of  life  ethic’’ and rejection of the ‘‘quality of life  ethic.’’ Writing about the value of all human  life, he quoted the British writer Malcolm  Muggeridge’s statement that ‘‘however low  it flickers so fiercely burns, it is still a divine flame which no man dare presume to  put out, be his motives ever so humane and  enlightened.’’ And in the Roe v. Wade decision, he insisted, the Supreme Court ‘‘did not  explicitly reject the traditional American  idea of  intrinsic worth and value  in all  human life; it simply dodged the issue.’’  Likewise,  in his  famous  ‘‘Evil Empire’’  speech of March 1983—which most recall as  solely an indictment of the Soviet Union—  Ronald Reagan spoke strongly against the  denigration of innocent human life. ‘‘Abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to  one and half million unborn  children a  year,’’ he said. ‘‘Unless and until it can be  proven that the unborn child is not a living  entity, then its right to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness must be protected.’’  His actions were as clear as his words. He  supported  the Human Life Amendment,  which would have inscribed in the Constitution ‘‘the paramount right to life is vested in  each human being from the moment of fertilization without regard to age, health or  condition of dependency.’’ And he favored  bills in Congress that would have given every  human being—at all stages of development—  protection  as  a  person  under  the  14th  Amendment.  Aside from the moral principle, President  Reagan would also have questioned picking  the people’s pocket to support commercial  research. He understood the significance of  putting  the  imprimatur  of  the  nation,  through public financing, behind questionable research.  He consistently opposed federal support for  the destruction of innocent human life. After  the charter expired for the Department of  Health, Education and Welfare’s ethical advisory board—which in the 1970’s supported  destructive research on human embryos—he  began a de facto ban on federal financing of  embryo research that he held to throughout  his presidency.

1269,90,2004-06-25,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, on June  23, 2004, I gave a statement on the  Feingold amendment concerning  the  Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional authority. When it appeared in  the RECORD, text was somehow inadvertently added to my statement. My  statement should have ended after the  sixth full paragraph of column three on  page S7266. I can certainly understand  how something  like this could have  happened as we were all working late  into the night under very tight deadlines. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened and I bet  it won’t be the last.  Of course, this is no fault of the good  people of the Official Reporters of Debates. They do outstanding work and I  know this will continue.  The following is how my statement  should have appeared:  I rise today to express my strong support  for the amendment offered by Senator Feingold.  Senator Feingold’s amendment, which  I  am a proud co-sponsor, would allow the work  of the Inspector General of the Coalition  Provisional Authority (CPA–IG) to continue  its work uninterrupted after the June 30  handover.  This is critical. Congress provided more  than $18 billion to rebuild Iraq, roughly the  same amount that we spend on the rest of  the  world  combined.  Congress  jammed  through the  Iraq supplemental appropriations bill in an extremely short time, without a sufficient number of hearings, into a  very chaotic environment without the usual  financial controls.  Recognizing this reality, Congress created  a strong, independent Inspector General to  help police these funds.  In the months that followed passage of the  Iraq Supplemental, we heard numerous reports of waste, fraud and abuse. If anything,  this should have send a clear signal to the  administration and Congress that we need  more—not less—oversight of these funds. It  defies logic, then, that the State Department  is now proposing to weaken the one entity  that Congress specifically tasked with keeping track of these tax dollars.  The State Department’s plan could undermine the independence of this Inspector General and disrupt this important work, reducing Congress’s ability to account for these  funds. It’s unlocking the vault to those who  want to cheat us.  The State Department also has told the  Appropriations Committee that it will have  to create 25 new positions to handle the work  in Iraq.  Let me get this straight. We want to close  down an IG that has about 60 people in place,  which are actively conducting audits and  rooting out waste fraud and abuse.  After the administration is finished closing  down that office, they will turn around and  hire 25 new people to do the same work—only  through at a lower level office at the State  Department.  Why on Earth would we want to do this?  At a time when we are hearing weekly reports of abuse by Haliburton and others, why  would we want to re-invent the wheel? Why  would we downgrade the status of the CPA–  IG and undermine its independence? It just  does not make any sense.  This is why the amendment offered by Senator from Wisconsin is so important.  This is why I support his amendment.  I thank the chair for allowing me to  make this correction.  f  PEER-REVIEW PROSTATE CANCER  RESEARCH PROGRAM  ",2004

1271,97,2004-06-25,Mr. LEAHY.," I am pleased that today  the Senate will pass the Cooperative  Research  and Technology Enhancement Act, the CREATE Act of 2004. As  I have noted before, the United States  Congress has a long history of strong  intellectual  property  laws,  and  the  Constitution charges us with the responsibility of crafting laws that foster  innovation and ensure that creative  works are guaranteed  their  rightful  protections. This past March, I joined  with Senator HATCH, Senator KOHL,  and Senator FEINGOLD in introducing  the CREATE Act, which will provide a  needed remedy to one aspect of our nation’s patent laws.  Our bill is a narrow one that promises to protect American jobs and encourage additional growth in America’s  information economy.  In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-  Dole Act, which encouraged private entities and not-for-profits such as universities to form collaborative partnerships that aid innovation. Prior to the  enactment  of  this  law, universities  were issued fewer than 250 patents each  year. Thanks to the Bayh-Dole Act, the  number of patents universities have  been issued in more recent years has  surpassed  two  thousand—adding billions of dollars annually to the US  economy.  The CREATE Act corrects for a provision  in the Bayh-Dole Act which,  when read  literally, runs counter to  the intent of that legislation. In 1997,  the United States Court of Appeals for  the Federal Circuit ruled, in Oddzon  Products, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that  non-public information may in certain  cases  be  considered  ‘‘prior  art’’—a  standard which generally prevents an  inventor from obtaining a patent. The  Oddzon ruling was certainly sound law,  but it was not sound public policy, and  as a result some collaborative teams  have been unable to receive patents for  their work. As a consequence, there is  a deterrent from forming this type of  partnership, which has proved so beneficial to universities, the private sector, the American worker, and the U.S.  economy.  Recognizing Congress’ intended purpose in passing the Bayh-Dole Act, the  Federal Circuit  invited Congress  to  better conform the language of the act  to the intent of the legislation. The  CREATE Act does exactly that by ensuring that non-public information is  not considered ‘‘prior art’’ when the information  is used  in a collaborative  partnership under the Bayh-Dole Act.  The bill that the Senate  is passing  today also includes strict evidentiary  burdens to ensure that the legislation  is  tailored narrowly  so as only  to  achieve this goal that—although narrow—is vitally important.  I also wish to draw attention to Senator HATCH’s thoughtful explication of  some of the more complex issues surrounding the CREATE Act. I agree entirely with his comments, which I believe will prove useful for those seeking a background understanding of this  legislation.

1277,104,2004-06-25,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker I rise today  in the spirit of Independence Day to recognize  the will and strength of our men and women  in uniform as  they  fought  in wars past and  continue  to maintain our commitment  to democracy  throughout  the world. Our veterans  are living examples of the ideals of our founding fathers and it is those same ideals that are  inspiring a new generation of veterans.  More than 300 years ago, the first generation of American veterans fought a war to establish our sovereignty. Along with our independence came the understanding that America would need protection, and we would need  a constant military force to ensure the preservation  of  these  freedoms. Americans  answered the call to duty, and the willingness of  our troops to boldly go into harms way in the  defense of democracy has not wavered.  As our nation’s veterans volunteered to risk  their lives for our protection, our country and  its leaders have an obligation to provide them  with  the care and resources  they need and  are entitled to once they retire. Veterans have  made significant, personal sacrifices and have  earned the very best we can offer them.  Yesterday marked  the 60th anniversary of  the GI Bill, an important step our leaders took  to recognize the commitment we owe our veterans. Because of  the GI Bill, our veterans  were given assistance with the costs of a college education and helped with the purchase  of a home or business.  A lot was done, but there is still much to do.  Health benefits need improving, the Widow’s  Tax and Disabled Veterans Tax need ending  and education benefits should still be expanded. We cannot  increase  their costs  for  health care, and we must not cut funding to  their system.  George Washington said  ‘‘the willingness  with which our young people are  likely  to  serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall  be directly proportional to how they perceive  the veterans of earlier wars were treated and  appreciated by their nation.’’ Our nation’s veterans served and protected us, and they inspired the soldiers who responded to the call  after them. They fought for our country, for the  continued prosperity of our government, and  once their service has ended, they should not  have to fight the government for the benefits  they deserve.  I call on my colleagues in Congress to continue to work together to provide veterans with  the best healthcare and  the highest compensation, as it is the least they have earned  for their years of service. PAYING TRIBUTE TO TAMERA  BICKETT  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 23, 2004 ",2004
1278,104,2004-06-25,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to pay tribute to the life  and legacy of Tamera ‘‘Tami’’ Bickett of Powell Butte, Oregon. Tami bravely battled  the  Storm King Mountain Fire outside the town of  Glenwood Springs, Colorado in 1994, but succumbed to the blaze along with thirteen fellow  firefighters while working to protect the City. I  personally served as a firefighter and understand the risks they face each and every day.  Witnessing the awful inferno that fateful July  day, I know Tami and her comrades battled  the  fire with  the utmost courage and valor.  With the tenth anniversary of the Storm King  Fire approaching,  I believe  it appropriate  to  recognize  the sacrifice Tami and  the Storm  King Firefighters made on behalf of a grateful  community, state and nation.  Born and raised in Lebanon, Oregon, Tami  was a competitive athlete in high school, participating on the cross-country and volleyball  teams. In her senior year of high school, she  represented her community as a Strawberry  Festival princess. Tami joined the U.S. Forest  Service in 1988, and was a Squad Boss for  the Prineville Hotshots, an elite group of firefighters who specialize  in wildland  fire suppression. She enjoyed the challenging rigors  of fighting fires, even when injuries sustained  on the job made her work difficult. She was a  dedicated member of her crew, and received  a great deal of satisfaction from helping others. Above all, she was devoted to her family  and friends.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to rise before  this body of Congress and this nation to pay  tribute  to  the  life and memory of Firefighter  Tamera Bickett. Tami personified the Hotshots  credo  of  Safety,  Teamwork  and  Professionalism; putting herself in harm’s way for unfamiliar people and places. She made the ultimate sacrifice doing what she  loved, and  I,  along with the Glenwood Springs community  and the State of Colorado are eternally grateful to this brave young woman. f  TRIBUTE TO BISHOP VERNON  RANDOLPH BYRD  HON.

1279,104,2004-06-25,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to Bishop Vernon Randolph Byrd,  one of eight legendary leaders of the African  Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) who will  be  retiring at  this  year Quadrennial Conference  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana. A native of  South Carolina, Bishop Byrd received a public  school education. After graduating  from Bell  Street High School, he enrolled at Allen University, where he  received  the Bachelor of  Arts degree. He later received a Master of Sacred Theology degree from Boston University.  Called to preach at the age of 12, Bishop  Byrd was licensed to preach at the age of 17.  His ministry included pastorates at Macedonia  AME Church  in Seaford, Delaware  (1954– 1959); St. Paul AME Church in Hamilton, Bermuda  (1959–1966);  and Macedonia  AME  Church in Camden, New Jersey (1979–1984).  He also served as Presiding Elder of the Newark District from 1966–1967.  Bishop Byrd was elected the 105th Bishop  of the African Methodist Episcopal Church at  1984 General Conference and was assigned  the 14th Episcopal District. He initiated numerous projects under his administration—one in  particular was  the Frank Curtis Cummings  Health Clinic, which was built in Monrovia, Liberia.  During his tenure he presided over the 16th,  13th, and 5th Episcopal Districts, where his  mission continued to be saving souls for the  building of God’s kingdom. His motto is ‘‘Unless  souls  are  saved,  nothing  is  saved!’’  Bishop  Byrd  holds memberships  in  the  NAACP, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., and  the Royal Lodge of Scotland.  Bishop Byrd is married to Theora Lindsey  Byrd. They are the parents of four.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to join me in paying tribute to Bishop Vernon  Randolph Byrd upon his retirement from the  Bishopric. He has provided tremendous leadership for the AME Church, and his long history of educational leadership and service will  influence future generations for ages to come.  AME founder Richard Allen would be deeply  proud of his Episcopal descendent. f  A  TRIBUTE  IN  HONOR  OF  2004  LEGRAND SMITH OUTSTANDING  TEACHER AWARD WINNER LOLA  COLLINS OF PARMA, MICHIGAN  HON.

The formidable responsibility of molding and inspiring young minds to  the avenues of hope, opportunity and achievement partially rests in the hands of our teachers. Today, I would like to recognize a teacher  from Parma, Michigan that significantly influenced and motivated exceptional students in  academics and leadership who were winners  of the LeGrand Smith Scholarship.  Lola Collins teaches fourth and fifth grade at  Parma Elementary in Parma. She is credited  with instilling in students an enthusiasm for not  only these subjects, but also for life.

1281,111,2004-06-25,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I want to explain  why I voted against the Rapid Acquisition Authority  for Combat Emergencies Bill  (H.R.  4323), when it was added to the suspension  calendar for a vote earlier this week.  During  the past year, we have seen  repeated examples of waste, fraud, and abuse  in contracts awarded by the U.S. Defense Department  to  the Halliburton Corporation and  other military  contractors  that have poorly  served our  troops and  the American  taxpayers. Not only do  I  lack confidence  that  such procurement sloth has stopped, those of  us in Congress who have called for in-depth  congressional investigations have been stonewalled.  In light of this dismal track record, Congress  should not open the door even wider and provide even greater authority for the Pentagon to  award lucrative contracts to contractors without competition and with even  less scrutiny  and  congressional  oversight. Nevertheless,  H.R. 4323 would waive existing safeguards  against war profiteering and other contract  abuses.  Congress  is already moving  to authorize  and appropriate up to $1.2 billion to provide  additional equipment for our troops in every instance where critical shortages have been  identified. That is one of the important reasons  why I voted in favor of the FY 2005 Defense  Authorization Bill, when the House passed it  last month.  Finally, the supporters of this bill claim it is  needed to cut through existing, cumbersome  Pentagon acquisition regulations to respond to  urgent needs of our troops in combat emergencies. But there is mounting evidence to the  contrary.  I believe  the equipment shortages  among some of our troops in Iraq during the  past year resulted from poor pre-war planning  and serious miscalculations  in  the Pentagon  by the architects of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Quite simply, U.S. Army war planners didn’t  issue enough purchase orders, before the invasion of Iraq was launched, to ensure that all  of our troops on the ground in Iraq had what  they needed during the conventional combat  phase of this conflict. Those mistakes and the  equipment  shortages  they  caused became  even more costly since President Bush announced the end of combat in Iraq on May 1,  2003, and  the nature of  the military  threat  changed and the armed insurgency expanded.  This Congress should act  to address  those  mistakes, not use them as an opportunity to  hand out more no-bid contracts.  I believe H.R. 4323 could actually make a  bad situation worse. f  IN HONOR OF EDWARD LICHT  HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004

A life-long resident of Cuyahoga County, Mr.  Licht served as a Special Agent with the U.S.  Treasury Department  for  twenty-five  years.  During his tenure as Special Agent, Mr. Licht  assisted  in  the  investigation, apprehension  and conviction of criminals involved in major  gambling, illegal drug and money laundering  operations. For his  invaluable  service, Mr.  Licht was honored with several awards, including two Special Achievement awards, One Superior Service award, and an Honorable Mention  for  Outstanding  Community  Service  award. Since 1999, Mr. Licht has held the position of Baliff with the Garfield Heights Municipal Court. His  unwavering  integrity,  outstanding communication abilities and strong  work ethic continues to uplift all facets of this  regional court system.  Beyond his significant professional contributions, Mr. Licht continues to volunteer his time  and  talents within our community. He continues to be an active member of the Democratic Party within our community. A long-time  member of the Cuyahoga County Democratic  Party, Mr. Licht currently serves as Deputy  Treasurer. He has also been very active in the  Independence Democratic Party  for many  years, as a member and an officer. Moreover,  Mr. Licht continues to make an impact upon  the lives of many as a volunteer probation officer with  the Bedford and Garfield Heights  court systems. His positive outlook and kind  nature, combined with his sense of compassion and wonderful sense of humor, continuously serves to uplift those around him.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor and recognition of Mr. Ed Licht, upon  being selected as the Regional Court Officer  of the Year. Mr. Licht’s professional contribution  to our  federal and regional  justice system—reflected by strong ethics and a high  level of  integrity, continues  to be significant  and invaluable. Moreover, Mr. Licht’s concern  for his community and commitment  to  the  democratic process continues to instill strength  and integrity throughout the Democratic Party,  and serves to strengthen our entire community. f  HONORING EXEMPLARY  EDUCATOR KATHY PUTMAN  HON.

1283,111,2004-06-25,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize Kathy Putman, an exemplary educator, who is retiring after forty years in the  classroom at John F. Kennedy High School in  Fremont, California.  Immediately after graduating from San Jose State University, Kathy’s  career  in education began at Kennedy High  School.  She was among  the  first  instructors when  the new high school was opened  in 1965.  Teaching Government and Economics to high  school seniors at Kennedy High School is the  only job Kathy has ever had. She was only a  couple of years older than her first students.  Over the decades, she has taught many children of former students in her class.  For years Kennedy High School had a contest for ‘‘Most Popular Teacher.’’ Kathy won so  often the contest was discontinued. Each year  her yearbook is filled with the penned thoughts  of adoring students. Thousands of young Fremont students have passed through her classroom where the walls are covered with photographs and notes  from  former students. Assuming Kathy had 200–300 students a year,  for 40 years, this adds up to between 8,000– 12,000 students she has touched during her  career.

1284,118,2004-06-25,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to a fallen hero, Petty Officer 1st  Class Brian J. Ouellette of Maynard, Massachusetts. He gave his  life  in service  to our  country, and we will forever be grateful.  Brian was a U.S. Navy SEAL deployed as  part of Operation Enduring Freedom and serving with the elite Navy Special Warfare Group  Two based out of Little Creek, Virginia. He  died tragically on May 29th along with three of  his comrades when their Humvee hit a landmine in the Zabul province of Afghanistan.  Petty Officer 1st Class Ouellette grew up in  Waltham, Massachusetts and graduated from  Waltham High School  in 1985. His parents,  Jack and Peg, now reside in the town of Maynard in my congressional district.  A fourteen-year veteran of the Navy, Brian  joined  the service  in 1990 and became a  member of  the elite SEAL  team  in 1991.  Friends remember him as a great teammate  and tough opponent on the football field and  a fierce competitor in Kempo-style karate.  Brian’s parents are proud, not just for the  supreme sacrifice he made on behalf of his  country, but for the honor he brought to them  as a Navy SEAL and loving son. Despite his  tough exterior, Brian’s family describes him as  compassionate and nurturing brother of seven  siblings and uncle to nine nieces and nephews. Brian’s  family deeply  impacted his  life,  and he left an indelible imprint on them.  Petty Officer 1st Class Ouellette was a  brave sailor who gave his life to restore freedom and democracy in the war-torn country of  Afghanistan and support the global war on terrorism. It is lives like his, taken too soon, that  remind us of the true price of freedom.  I have requested an American flag be flown  over the United States Capitol in memory of  Brian to honor his brave service to our country. This flag will be delivered to his family.  Brian died fighting for the country he loved,  alongside the fellow sailors he respected and  with the family he adored forever in his heart.  Our Nation  is humbled and grateful  for his  sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, we should all take a moment  to  recognize Petty Officer 1st Class Brian  Ouellette of the United States Navy SEALS for  his ultimate service to our Nation. HOMEOWNERSHIP BUILDS STRONG  COMMUNITIES  HONORING FUTURE UNLIMITED  AWARD RECIPIENTS  HON. ROB PORTMAN  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1285,118,2004-06-25,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, June is National Homeownership Month. Stronger  families,  better  schools,  and  homeownership  produce healthy neighborhoods and communities.  When people own their homes, other benefits follow, such as economic security and family stability. Over the years, home values have  generally increased, making them a good investment and a great way for families to build  up assets  that can be used  for everyday  needs, unexpected setbacks, and even helping to send a child to college.  Neighborhoods where people own homes  are more stable. People  tend  to  take better  care of property  they own and care more  about  the rest of  the neighborhood as well.  Homeownership also leads to a more vibrant  community because home sales attract grocery stores, restaurants and other small businesses that add stability and job opportunities.  With all  these benefits,  it  is discouraging  that  there are some areas  in our country  where the homeownership rate is very low. In  my home state of Ohio, the City of Cincinnati’s  homeownership rate is 39 percent, far below  the national average of 68 percent. And even  in the rural areas of my district where the percentage of home owners is higher, we are still  well below the national average.  Ohio has a shortage of affordable homes in  inner-city and rural areas. This is also true in  many other states. To help address this problem, Representative BENCARDINand I introduced H.R. 839, the Renewing the Dream Tax  Credit Act, which is based on a proposal advanced  by President Bush. The measure  would make a  tax credit available  to developers or  investors  that build or  rehabilitate  homes for sale to low- and moderate-income  buyers in these areas. H.R. 839 has the support of nearly 300 House members, and would  make it more attractive for developers to create affordable housing  in urban and  rural  areas in which the need is greatest.  Mr. Speaker, when people buy a home, they  make an investment in that community. Enacting H.R. 839 will help make homeownership  achievable for more Americans. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 17 New  Hampshire students who graduated at the top  of their high school class and are being recognized for their academic achievements by the  Knights  of Columbus  in Rochester, New  Hampshire.  The Rochester Knights of Columbus Council  founded the Future Unlimited Banquet in June  of 1998  to honor students  from  the Greater  Rochester area who have achieved high levels  of scholastic excellence. The  ‘‘brainchild’’ of  Don Leeman,  the banquet honors valedictorians  and  salutatorians  from  eight  high  schools in the region for their academic excellence and contributions to the community. The  Council has had much positive feedback from  the greater community for their efforts to promote intellectual fellowship, and plan to extend  this successful recognition banquet across the  state and country.  The students to be honored for their scholastic achievements are:  Bryn Paslawski of Durham, valedictorian at  St.  Thomas Aquinas High School; Marie  Osborn  of Portsmouth,  salutatorian  at St.  Thomas Aquinas High School; David Thompson of Kittery, Maine, salutatorian at St. Thomas Aquinas High School; Trevor Sherwood of  Barrington,  valedictorian  at  Dover  High  School; Brittany Soper of Dover, salutatorian  at Dover High School; Kristen Couture of  Somersworth,  valedictorian at Somersworth  High School; Danielle Daigle of Rollinsford,  salutatorian at Somersworth High School; and  Khari Lizotte of Rochester, valedictorian at  Spaulding High School.  Kimberly Montini of Rochester, salutatorian  at Spaulding High School; Katy Huppe of  Farmington, valedictorian at Farmington High  School; Casey Raasumaa of Farmington, salutatorian  at  Farmington High School;  Jacqueline Elliott of Milton, valedictorian at Nute  High School; Kayla Gagne of Milton, salutatorian at Nute High School; Tonya Prescott of  Laconia, valedictorian at Alton High School;  Meredith Roy of Alton, salutatorian at Alton  High School; Meaghan Maguire of Wolfeboro,  valedictorian  at Kingswood Regional High  School; and, Jamison Costello of Wolfeboro,  salutatorian  at  Kingswood  Regional  High  School.  These 17 students are excellent examples  of the hard work, energy and dedication that  is necessary  to pursuing higher academic  goals. They are among the brightest students  in the state and offer much hope for the future. They truly exemplify what is good about  today’s youth. I congratulate all of the students  for a job well done, and I also congratulate the  members of the Rochester Knights of Columbus for their efforts to recognize outstanding  students.

1287,125,2004-06-25,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Margaret Sims. Over 1,252 of  our soldiers have a new friend in Ms. Sims,  who a year ago began writing to a soldier she  did not know  from her hometown of Gulf  Breeze, FL. At 19 years of age and a rising  sophomore at the University of West Florida,  Margaret epitomizes patriotism  in  the United  States. Margaret not only corresponds with  many of the troops in Iraq on a regular basis  in something she calls ‘‘Project Appreciation,’’  but also stands outside the local grocery store  during the weekends gathering signatures for  ‘‘Thank You’’ banners. She has been known to  gather 400 signatures per banner, sending  them to troops in places like Tikrit and Kirkuk,  as well as making care-packages  filled with  cans of  tuna, crackers, and  toiletries  for a  lucky few that have become her regular recipients. She has been honored in the Pensacola  News Journal and throughout the First District  of Florida, but it is time that she is recognized  for her efforts by Congress.  Patriotism is not only shown by our soldiers  in the field but by our people at home. Her  love  for our country and her support of  the  troops is the true essence of patriotism. She  shows our men and women in the field how  valued and supported  they are, giving  them  hope and faith from back home. By sending  letters and care packages, and by taking the  time  to gather signatures on a banner  from  people throughout her community, Ms. Sims is  making a true difference in America, a model  patriot for all of us to admire.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress I would like to thank Margaret Sims  for her patriotism and support of our troops.  What we need in this country are more young  men and women like her. f  70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL CREDIT  UNION ACT  HON. SPENCER BACHUS  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1288,125,2004-06-25,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor the 70th anniversary of the passage of  the Federal Credit Union Act on June 26,  1934. Since the passage of this momentous  legislation, federal credit unions have consistently proven themselves to offer high quality financial services at low costs to over 85 million  Americans.  As members of this body, many of us are  well aware through first-hand knowledge of the  importance of federal credit unions. Owned by  their members, federal credit unions are financial institutions that embrace the true spirit of  volunteerism. Federal credit unions are run by  volunteer boards of directors that are elected  by their members, and encourage the value of  saving regularly to build economic security for  the future.  The entire premise of the credit union movement is the commitment to values that we can  all embrace. Folks with modest means who oftentimes are overlooked by other types of financial institutions are assured of access to financial services  thanks  to America’s credit  unions. Driven by a deeply held commitment  to member service rather than financial profits,  credit unions offer not only low-cost financial  services but also much-needed financial education to some of the most neglected sectors  of our society.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize and applaud the passage of the  Federal Credit Union Act seventy years ago.  In conjunction with all the fine work of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions  (NAFCU),  the  trade association  that exclusively represents the interests of federal credit  unions, there is no doubt in my mind of the  benefits Americans across the nation will continue to gain because of the good work of our  nation’s federal credit unions for many more  years to come. f  INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION  ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 SPEECHOF  HON.

1289,125,2004-06-25,Mr. SHAYS.," Mr. Chairman, from its inception in 1996, the United Nations’ Oil-for-Food  Program  (OFF) was susceptible  to political  manipulation and financial corruption. Trusting  Saddam Hussein to exercise sovereign control  over billions of dollars of oil sales and commodity purchases  invited  the  illicit premiums  and kickback schemes now coming to light.  But much is still not known about the exact  details of Oil-for-Food  transactions. That  is  one reason my Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and  International  Relations convened a hearing on April 21st to  help  pierce  the  veil  of  secrecy  that  still  shrouds the largest humanitarian aid effort in  history.  This much we know: The Hussein regime  reaped an estimated $10.1 billion  from  this  program: $5.7 billion in smuggled oil; and $4.4  billion in oil surcharges and kickbacks on humanitarian purchases through the Oil-for-Food  Program. There is no innocent explanation for  this.  At the hearing, the Subcommittee heard the  program, while successful in many ways, was  riddled with corruption and the independent efforts of the Iraqis to investigate the fraud was  being stifled by the Coalition Provisional Authority.  We want  the State Department,  the CPA,  the  intelligence community, and  the U.N.  to  know there has to be a full accounting of all  Oil-for-Food  transactions, even  if  that unaccustomed  degree  of  transparency  embarrasses some members of the Security Council.  Two months ago, U.N. Secretary General  Kofi Annan assured me he wants to get to the  bottom of this scandal and restore faith in the  ability of the U.N. to do its job. Subsequently,  the Secretary General appointed Paul Volcker  to lead an independent panel to look into the  Oil-for-Food Program. While Mr. Volcker brings expertise and prestige to the task, we are concerned about the  slow  pace  of  the U.N.  investigation. The  Volcker panel has just announced the hiring of  senior staff. Nevertheless,  they continue  to  say an  interim report, possibly  this summer,  will address the conduct of UN employees and  allegations  about  the Secretary General’s  son’s involvement.  But we also need to know more than what  just happened at the U.N. We also need to  know what happened at the US Mission.

1290,132,2004-06-25,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor  the  life of Mr. Charles B.  ‘‘Sonny’’  Towner, Jr., who passed away on June 2,  2004. A dedicated member of the Santa Cruz  community, Charles  is survived by his wife  Ellen, and will be greatly missed.  Charles led a life of public service, first serving in the 6th Aircraft Repair Unit Floating during World War II. Following the war, Charles  returned to California to sell sporting goods,  becoming a prominent businessman  in  the  Bay Area  for over 30 years. Continuing his  public service, Charles also became the business manager for the Cambrian School District  in San Jose  for  ten years. During  this  time, Charles was an active member of  the  Camden High School Booster Club and volunteered  for  the Cambrian Park Little League  and Pony League.  Following his  retirement  in 1990, Charles  continued his commitment to his community,  as he volunteered with the Trinity Presbyterian  Church, Santa Cruz Gardens School Volunteer Program and the California Grey Bears.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to express my  deepest  sympathy  to Charles’  family  and  honor him by celebrating his life and contribution to society. As a prominent member of the  Santa Cruz community, Charles Towner, Jr.  will be missed. f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO LESLIE  BAILEY  HON. SCOTT McINNIS  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1291,132,2004-06-25,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take  this opportunity  to pay  tribute  to Leslie  Bailey and thank her for the remarkable civic  contributions she has made to her Fort Collins  community, the State of Colorado and this nation. Leslie started her career volunteering her  services to the Federal Emergency Management Agency following the flood disaster that  struck Fort Collins in the summer of 1997, and  has remained in public service ever since. I  am pleased to be able to pay tribute to Leslie,  and thank her for her tireless work.  After helping her community’s flood victims  in 1997, Leslie was asked to join FEMA as a  Disaster Assistance Employee. Since  that  time, she has served in Community Relations,  Public Affairs, and Congressional Affairs, with  a focused area of expertise on Congressional  and Intergovernmental liaison functions. From  1998 to 2004 Leslie served as one of FEMA’s  primary Congressional and Intergovernmental  Affairs Liaisons. She has held the position of  Congressional Liaison, on over 40  federally  declared  disaster  operations  including  response efforts to the September 11th attacks  and preparing for the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Leslie currently serves as the Lead Congressional Liaison on one of three national Emergency Response Teams  for FEMA, and  frequently works as part of the Office of Legislative Affairs Disaster Team. Her hard work has  made her a national asset to the agency and  to this nation.  Mr. Speaker it is clear that Leslie Bailey is  a woman of great commitment to humanitarian  efforts in the State of Colorado and our country. Her hard work and willingness to give of  her time to help federal disaster victims is worthy of  recognition before  this body of Congress  today.  I wish  to extend my sincerest  thanks to Leslie for her continuing work on behalf of a grateful nation. f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1292,132,2004-06-25,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, every visitor  who comes  to my office  is greeted by a  plaque  that bears  the  inscription of Ronald  Reagan’s signature and  this quote,  ‘‘There’s  no limit to what a man can do or where he  can go if he doesn’t mind who gets the credit.’’  These words are characteristic of  the great  man that served as the fortieth President of  the United States of America. I am involved  with politics today because of the inspiration I  received  from Ronald Reagan.  I believe he  was  the  true example of what a statesman  can be, and I hold that example close to my  heart as I carry out my own duties.  President Reagan will always be  remembered as an unabashed patriot. He was convinced of  the ability of  the United States  to  provide the hope of freedom to those enslaved  by totalitarianism and communism. President  Reagan’s vision of the world and the future of  this country would not be dimmed or daunted  by ideological threat, and he was not afraid to  stand up to tyranny and aggression. From the  beginning of his presidency, President Reagan  realized  the potential cost of  inaction and  weakness in the face of Soviet defiance and  nuclear threat, and he took action. Through a  series of defense budgets, he increased defense spending 35 percent during his  two  terms, ensuring the country the resources necessary  for  security. Additionally, President  Reagan managed to negotiate the first U.S.Soviet treaty to reduce the number of nuclear  weapons through a series of four summits with  Mikhail Gorbachev. President Reagan was always clear about what he expected and never  more  so  than when  he  pleaded  at  the  Brandenberg Gates,  ‘‘Mr. Gorbachev,  tear  down this wall!’’  President Reagan planted democracy in regions of the world that have never tasted the  joys of  freedom. He  taught newly  liberated  people across the globe that hard work and  faith in God could result in prosperity, a sense  of satisfaction in one’s own legacy, and a better outlook for tomorrow. He wanted the American dream  to be a  reality  throughout  the  world.  President Reagan will also be remembered  as a man of humble beginnings. He proclaimed America as a place where ‘‘everyone  can rise as high and as far as his ability will  take him.’’ Born in Tampico, Illinois, President  Reagan used his abilities to establish a career  in Hollywood. He continued to work and learn  as he rose through California politics and went  on to serve two successful terms as the leader  of our nation. He wanted all Americans  to  have  the same  freedom and opportunity  to  pursue success, and he consistently promoted  that  ideal  through policies of  limited government. He said,  ‘‘Government can and must  provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.’’  What makes Ronald Reagan most unforgettable was his unfailing optimism. Even as our  nation mourns, we cannot help but smile at  the thought of his cheerful and radiant personality. President Reagan possessed a sense of  humor strong enough  to withstand even  the  pain of an assassin’s bullet. Demonstrating his  trademark good nature, he said to the doctors  about to operate on his bullet wounds, ‘‘I hope  you’re all Republicans.’’  It was  this  characteristic sanguinity  that swept up a downtrodden America and reenergized its faith in  freedom, the Presidency, and our military.  Ronald Reagan was many things. He was a  man of reason, a man of sincerity, a man willing to listen. And he is a man whose character,  grace,  and wisdom will  be  deeply  missed by this nation. f  TO HONOR KATY DOYLE  HON. NICK LAMPSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1293,132,2004-06-25,Mr. LAMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I want to take  this opportunity  to recognize  the exceptional  athletic achievements of an outstanding individual, personal friend, and fellow Texan.  Katy Doyle, a member of the Texas A&M  track and field team, led her team with an incredible athletic performance in the 2004 Big  12 Outdoor track and field conference championships. In the javelin competition, Doyle’s  throw of 54.75m put her team in first place in  the event, and shattered a conference record  that had stood for five years.  Doyle’s gold medal performance at the conference championship added to her two previous wins  in  the same event  in 2000 and  2003 conference meets.  Mr. Speaker, being a personal friend of both  Katy and her family, I can say her on-field performance is a testament to her character off  the field. Coming off a seemingly debilitating  injury that kept her out of competition in 2001  and 2002, she persevered and ultimately regained her championship form.  I am honored to give credit to this talented  athlete, deserving individual, and great Texan. f  THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  U.P.C. BAR CODE  HON. JOHN A.

1294,132,2004-06-25,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  join with my constituents and friends in Troy,  Ohio to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the  U.P.C. bar code. When a pack of Wrigley’s  chewing gum was scanned by a cashier at the  Marsh Supermarket in Troy on June 26, 1974,  few understood the impact this simple action  would have.

1295,139,2004-06-25,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, we rise today  in honor and remembrance of former Cleveland Mayor Ralph S. Locher—Devoted family  man, accomplished attorney, Ohio Supreme  Court justice, community leader, and admired  friend and mentor. Mr. Locher’s term as Mayor  of the City of Cleveland during a turbulent period of Cleveland’s history, solidified his reputation as a man of honesty,  integrity and  heart.  Mayor Locher was born  in Romania  to  American parents. His family left Europe to return  to America,  settling  in western Ohio.  Mayor Locher graduated from Bluffton College  in 1936 and graduated from Western University School of Law three years later. He practiced  law  in Cleveland with Davis & Young  until 1945, when he left for Columbus to accept the position of secretary of the Industrial  Commission of Ohio.  His political career began  in 1953, when  Mayor Locher was appointed by Cleveland  Mayor Anthony Celebrezze as the city law director. Mayor Locher did not seek elected office—it  sought  him.  In  1962,  Mayor  Celebrezze resigned his post to accept an appointment by President  John F. Kennedy,  which immediately plunged Mr. Locher into the  role as Mayor of Cleveland. Mayor Locher significantly trounced his opponent at the special  election, and ran unopposed for a full term the  next year.  Following his departure from office, Mayor  Locher went on to be elected as probate judge  in 1972. In 1976, Mayor Locher was elected  as an Ohio Supreme Court justice, where he  served until retiring from the bench in 1988.  Mayor Locher served the bench with honor, integrity and concern, and garnered the admiration and respect of everyone associated with  the court.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join us  in honor, gratitude and remembrance of Mayor  Ralph S. Locher—An outstanding citizen, devoted  husband,  father,  grandfather  and  greatgrandfather, and an exceptional man and  caring  leader whose  life positively  impacted  the lives of countless. We extend our deepest  condolences to Mayor Locher’s beloved wife,  Eleanor, his daughter, Virginia Wells, and his  grandson, and great-granddaughter. His passing marks a deep loss for so many of us who  called him friend. Mayor Locher’s flawless legacy of exceptional leadership, judicial integrity  and sincere concern for others will be remembered always by the people of Cleveland—and  far beyond. Moreover, his kindness, grace,  and quiet dignity will always serve as example  of a successful leader and more importantly— an exceptional human being. f  APPLAUDING BETTY DUKES FOR  HER COURAGE IN STANDING UP  FOR WOMEN WORKERS AT WALMART  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 25, 2004 ",2004
1296,139,2004-06-25,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, last month, Vice President DICKCHENEYvisited the corporate headquarters of WalMart and praised the company for the example it is setting for American business. Here is  the example that Wal-Mart has set for American business:  If you violate workers’ organizing rights, you  can get away with it, receiving just a slap on  the wrist  from weak and  ineffective  federal  labor laws.  If you shift  the cost of health care onto  workers who cannot afford it, you can increase  your profits and have  taxpayer-funded programs like SCHIP pick up the tab.  If you distrust your own workforce enough to  disregard their safety, you can lock them inside your store overnight without a key.  If you want to increase the wealth of one of  the wealthiest families in the world, you can  maintain the lowest wages in the industry, laying off your most senior and loyal employees  and replacing them with lower-paid entry-level  workers.  If you want to eliminate competition in your  industry by lowering your wages and prices,  you can force U.S. suppliers to outsource their  manufacturing jobs, so that you can reap the  benefit of cheap  labor  from countries with  even worse workers’ rights records than our  own.  All of  these  reprehensible  labor practices  are detailed in the February 2004 report which  I commissioned, ‘‘Everyday Low Wages: The  Hidden Price We All Pay for Wal-Mart.’’ I urge  Vice President CHENEY to read it.  Today I submit to you, contrary to the Vice  President’s  remarks,  that  the employees of  Wal-Mart are beginning to set an example for  American workers—by fighting back on behalf  of  themselves and others who are unfairly  treated by their employer. This week, as the  attached L.A. Times article explains, a judge  in California certified the largest employmentdiscrimination class action in history. A class  of 1.5 million women who have worked at  Wal-Mart are suing the retail giant for sex discrimination. According to papers submitted in  court,  female employees are paid  less  than  their male counterparts, promoted  less  frequently than their male counterparts, and retaliated against when they complain. In today’s  workplace—all  too often  rife with employer  threats and intimidation—it takes a great deal  of courage from workers to stand up for their  rights. So I rise to salute one of those workers, a brave woman from my home district,  Betty Dukes of Pittsburg, California, one of  the lead plaintiffs in this historic lawsuit. She  has worked at Wal-Mart for ten years and simply wants a fair opportunity to succeed. She is  now  standing up  for over a million other  women who have punched the cash registers,  stocked  the shelves, and greeted customers  for years without that opportunity. Her courage  is  to be commended. And  I hail her as an  American hero. [From the LA Times, June 24, 2004]  WAL-MART PLAINTIFF STILL LOVES THE  STORE: WORKERWHO ISSPEARHEADING LANDMARKGENDERBIAS SUIT SAYS JUSTWANTSACHANCETOADVANCE  A  SHE  (By Donna Horowitz, Eric Slater and Lee  Romney)  Pittsburg, CA.—Less than 24 hours after a  federal judge ruled that 1.5 million women  who have worked for Wal-Mart could pursue  a class-action gender discrimination suit,  the lead plaintiff in the case was back on the  job here Wednesday nattily dressed, quick  with a smile and talking about how much  she likes the company she’s suing.  All Betty Dukes wanted, the 10–year veteran of the company said, was ‘‘the opportunity to advance myself with Wal-Mart.’’  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Martin J.  Jenkins in San Francisco ruled that the suit  originally  filed by Dukes and  five other  women could be expanded to virtually every  woman who has worked at the world’s largest company since late 1998. The suit alleges  that Wal-Mart pays women less than men for  performing the same job, passes over women  to promote less-qualified men and retaliates  against women who complain.  The judge’s ruling set the stage for what  could be the giant retailer’s greatest test  ever. The sheer number of plaintiffs means  that a loss or even a settlement could cost  the company billions of dollars.  As Dukes was receiving minor-celebrity  treatment from customers and co-workers— ‘‘Did you see my story in the paper today?’’  she asked customers, holding up a copy of a  local newspaper—officials from the Arkansas  retail colossus emphasized that Tuesday’s  ruling did not address the merits of the case  and said it would do nothing to influence the  company’s plans to expand in California and  elsewhere.  ‘‘It really doesn’t change anything,’’ said  Robert McAdam, the firm’s vice president for  state and local government relations. ‘‘Nothing is different as it relates to our development plans or our prospects for growth in  the state.’’  The company has weathered a series of  high-profile  tests,  most  recently  in  Inglewood, where Wal-Mart went so far as to  ask voters to allow a Supercenter in their  community only to be rejected. At the same  time, other communities in the state have  actively courted the retailer.  As Dukes smiled and welcomed customers  to the store in this town of 48,000 about 40  miles northeast of San Francisco, many of  the mixed emotions that Wal-Mart tends to  evoke were in evidence around her.  Lorell Belarde, 39, seemed to embody the  dichotomy of some customers.  ‘‘I really don’t even like the store,’’ said  the property manager after a short shopping  VerDate jul 14 2003  07:28 Jun 26, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A25JN8.050 E25PT1 ",2004
1297,146,2004-06-25,Mr. MICHAUD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  introduce a bill I authored that will create the  Northeast Regional Development Commission.  The Commission would be charged with  investing federal resources for economic development and  job creation  in  the most distressed  areas  of Maine, New Hampshire,  Vermont and New York.  This is an idea whose time has come. Its  roots can be traced as far back as 1965, when  Congress approved the creation of the Appalachian Regional Commission  (ARC). This  unique Federal-State partnership was charged  with promoting development in the depressed  Appalachian area  through  regional planning,  technical assistance, and funding of projects  aimed at encouraging economic prosperity.  It was a bold idea, and it worked. According  to  the National Association of Development  Organizations, since its creation, the ARC has  reduced the number of distressed counties in  their region from 219 to 100. It has cut the  poverty rate  from 31 percent  to 15 percent,  and helped 1,400 businesses create 26,000  new jobs in the region since 1977.  With a record like that, other regions began  to  look at  this model, and realize  that  they  needed the same thing in their own area. Over  the past decade, this has led to the creation  of three additional commissions and proposals  for two more.  When I arrived in Congress and saw these  proposals, it became clear that other regions  were catching on to a good idea, but that the  Northeast could be missing the boat. There is  currently no single body focused on the need  for  jobs and economic development  in  the  Northeast region.  The Northeast has a clear, compelling case  for coordinated federal investment. Compared  to the counties of some of the other regions  that have an existing or proposed commission,  a sample of Northeast counties along  the  Northern border  showed higher unemployment, much  higher  outmigration,  and  extremely similar, and  low, household  income.  All of these measures were far worse than the  national average.  Creating a regional commission would give  us the chance to look at economic development in a whole new way: as a challenge that  we can tackle together as a region. Together  we all face declining natural resource industries, aging infrastructure, and youth who are  leaving to seek opportunity elsewhere. But together, we also still possess abundant  resources, a good geographic location with opportunities to ship our products to the world,  and a trained workforce that is ready to take  on new challenges. The Commission created  in my bill would  utilize  the successful ARC approach where  local development districts and other non-profit  organizations bring project ideas and priorities  to  the Commission  from  the  local  level. Because local plans are approved by the state,  no state would have mandates thrust upon it  from outside.  Whether the need is new irrigation systems  for agriculture, land and forestry conservation  to maintain productive traditional uses, investment in our fishing infrastructure, new roads,  or health care facilities—a Federal commission  can play a key role in investing in our economy. Our region needs this kind of investment.  Already, the interest that this proposal has  generated among many diverse groups has  been a step in the right direction, as it has  helped to bring people together from many different sectors  to  think creatively, constructively, and cooperatively about our future. We  are off to a good start, and now there is a lot  more work to be done. f  HONORING JOSEPH A. PICHLER ON  HIS  RETIREMENT  FROM  THE  KROGER COMPANY  HON. ROB PORTMAN  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 25, 2004 ",2004
1298,146,2004-06-25,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a  friend and constituent, Joseph A.  Pichler, who  retired on June 24, 2004 as  Chairman of the Board of The Kroger Company, which is headquartered in my hometown  of Cincinnati. He has been an exemplary leader in academia, business and our community.  After earning an undergraduate degree from  Notre Dame and a Master’s and Ph.D. from  the University of Chicago, Joe taught for 15  years at the University of Kansas School of  Business, and served as Dean for six years.  From 1968 to 1970, he was Special Assistant  to  the U.S. Department of Labor’s Assistant  Secretary for Manpower.  Joe has had a truly extraordinary business  career, bringing energy, hard work and leadership to every assignment. Before his election  as Kroger’s Chairman, Joe served  the company as Chief Executive Officer; President and  Chief Operating Officer; and Executive Vice  President.  Joe  joined Dillon Companies  in  1980 as Executive Vice President, and was  elected to Kroger’s Board of Directors when  Dillon merged with Kroger in 1983.  Joe has pursued community service in our  area with equal enthusiasm. He heads  the  Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation’s  (3CDC) working group  that created a  new  development  strategy  for Cincinnati’s  Washington Park area. For many years, Joe  and his wife, Susan, have volunteered in the  historic Over-the-Rhine  neighborhood  near  Kroger’s  headquarters  building,  and  we  worked together on the new National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.  Last year, Joe asked me to help craft a legislative solution  that would allow Cincinnati’s  ‘‘One Stop’’ Employment Center  to continue  serving clients  in  the Over-the-Rhine area.  Since then, other Ohio counties have received  similar  legislative assistance.  Joe’s  role  in  keeping these key job training facilities open  cannot be overstated.  All of us in Cincinnati congratulate Joe on  his retirement from Kroger and wish him the  best in the new challenges ahead.

1299,153,2004-06-25,Ms. HOOLEY of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of  the passage of the Federal Credit Union Act.  Recognizing that every credit union exists ‘‘for  the purpose of promoting  thrift among  its  members and creating a source of credit for  provident or productive purposes,’’ Congress  passed the Federal Credit Union Act on June  26, 1934 and in so doing gave birth to the network of federal credit unions that continues to  serve our nation’s citizens today.  While  federal  credit unions have grown  since 1934,  their basic mission remains  the  same today as it was 70 years ago:  Federal credit unions now as they did then  provide  low cost  financial services  to  their  members; and  Federal credit unions now as then continue  to emphasize their traditional cooperative values of democratic control and volunteerism.  The unique democratic spirit of credit unions  is what sets them apart from other financial institutions. Seventy years after passage of the  Federal Credit Union Act, federal credit union  boards of directors are still elected democratically with every single member of the credit  union (regardless of the amount of his or her  savings) having an equal vote. What’s more,  the vast majority of credit union board members volunteer their time for the betterment of  the credit union, without compensation of any  kind.  Although credit unions are a very small segment of  the  financial services  industry,  that  democratic spirit and sense of volunteerism  has helped them grow over the course of the  past seventy years to serve more than 85 million Americans. Today, credit unions serve as  a viable, healthy alternative to other traditional  providers of financial services.  Credit unions also continue to serve a growing number of people of modest means. By  building branches in distressed neighborhoods  absent other  traditional  financial  institutions,  credit unions have helped encourage entrepreneurship and improve access to basic financial  services.  I  commend  the Nation’s  federal  credit  unions for the good work they have done for  the last 70 years and the good work they will,  no doubt, continue to do for the next 70 years. f  CHILD NUTRITION AND WIC  REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004 SPEECHOF  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1300,153,2004-06-25,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  strong support of S. 2507, the Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, which  both reflects—and improves upon—the bipartisan child nutrition bill we passed  in  the  House on March 24 of this year.  Like H.R. 3873, the Child Nutrition and WIC  Reauthorization Act will provide food security  to more children and families than ever before,  eliminate needless paperwork for program providers and place a renewed emphasis on obesity prevention through improved nutrition and  greater exercise.  But—fortunately  for America’s children—S.  2507 goes  further.  It expands  the popular  Lugar summer  food pilot  to  two additional  states.  It gives  five states new authority  to  look at eliminating  the  ‘‘reduced price’’ category for school lunch. It establishes important  new cost containment measures to ensure the  integrity of  the WIC program. And—perhaps  most significantly for those of us interested in  increasing participation  rates among eligible  children—S. 2507 provides mandatory funding  for all schools to directly certify food stamp-eligible children for free school lunch by 2008— and greater flexibility for schools to verify income  through  third party sources  like TANF  and Medicaid. These measures take an important step towards eliminating at least some of  the barriers that currently keep otherwise eligible children from accessing these critical programs.  Mr. Speaker,  in closing  I’d  like  to  thank  Chairman BOEHNER, our ranking member Mr.  MILLER, Mr. CASTLEand Ms. WOOLSEY—along  with Senators COCHRANand HARKIN—for all of  their hard work on this important legislation. I  think we can all be proud that—at least on this  issue—we have done the people’s work. f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Had  I  been present for legislative business on June  18, 2004, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on House  Amendments 580, 581, 585 and 592; and  would have voted  ‘‘nay’’ on House Amendments 578, 583, 584, and 589.  In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would have voted  ‘‘yea’’ on final passage of H.R. 4567, the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. HONORING THE LIFE OF GUAM’S  FIRST CHAMORRO TERRITORIAL  LIBRARIAN:  MAGDALENA  ‘‘MAGGIE’’ SANTOS TAITANO  HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO  OFGUAM  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 24, 2004 ",2004
1302,153,2004-06-25,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the memory of Magdalena ‘‘Maggie’’  Santos Taitano, Familian Oncho, who passed  away on June 17, 2004.  I also extend my  deepest sympathies and prayers to her family  and friends.  Maggie was born on July 1, 1928. She was  married to the late Guam Senator Richard Flores Taitano, and was mother to Taling Maria,  Richard  Jr.,  John  Joseph,  and  Carmen  Teresita. She was also a grandmother, greatgrandmother, wife, sister, auntie, godmother,  and  friend. A  devoted mother  and wife,  Maggie was also a religious person who demonstrated her commitment  to her community  through her involvement in various civic organizations. She was active politically as well,  and recognized  the  importance of protecting  Guam’s heritage and history for future generations.  This belief was reflected in her passion for  the  library sciences, an  interest Maggie  first  developed while working in a library while still  in high school. After graduating from George  Washington High School  in 1950, Maggie  began working as a  library assistant at  the  Guam Public Library. From there, Maggie pursued higher education, receiving a full scholarship to attend Mount Mary’s Catholic College  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she received  her Bachelor’s in business administration. She  continued her studies at Texas Women’s University  in Denton, Texas, becoming  the  first  Chamorro to earn a Master’s degree in library  sciences.  Maggie then returned home to begin a distinguished career in service to the people of  Guam.  In  1960,  she  became  the  first  Chamorro Territorial Librarian of  the Guam  Public Library—later renamed the Nieves M.  Flores Memorial Library. Some of her achievements included instituting the Summer Reading Program,  the Saturday Storytelling Program, the Pacific Area Collections, and making the library more accessible to the community. Although Maggie  retired  in 1987, she  could not stay away from the library for long,  returning to serve part-time at the University of  Guam’s Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Library.  She later transferred to the Micronesian Area  Research Center (MARC) where she had a  prominent role in putting together the papers  of public officials, including those of my husband,  the  late Governor Ricardo Bordallo.  It  was fitting that in 1997, MARC was renamed  the Richard F. Taitano Research Center  in  honor of the institution’s creator, her late husband.  I have been blessed to also call Maggie a  friend. We  first  knew each other  in high  school, and I was honored to be Godmother to  her daughter Carmencita. Our husbands were  also running mates in the 1970 Gubernatorial  election, running on the slogan ‘‘A New Day  for Guam.’’ I am deeply saddened by Maggie’s  passing, but know that she has left behind a  legacy that will be treasured for generations to  come.

1304,5,2004-07-06,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments and just to say again  that we had the opportunity, myself  and  the  gentleman  from California  (Chairman POMBO) of the Committee  on Resources, to travel with Secretary  Gale Norton, Secretary of the Interior,  to the Marshall  Islands earlier this  year, and were able to meet with the  President and others. I know they appreciate this gesture, and we have no  greater  friend than the Marshall Islands.  ",2004
1305,5,2004-07-06,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 410,  to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Constitution of  the Republic of  the Marshall  Islands and  that  the Marshall  Islands  is a  staunch ally of  the United States.  I want  to  begin by commending my  friend,  the Gentleman from Arizona Mr. FLAKE, for his leadership in introducing this worthwhile resolution of  which I am an original cosponsor.  The Republic of  the Marshall  Islands suffered for 400 years under the colonial regimes  of Spain and Germany. In the 20th century,  under the League of Nations system for governance of  territories, Japan governed  the  Marshall  Islands. During World War  II,  the  Marshall Islands were liberated from Japanese  rule  through  the  cooperation between  the  Marshallese people and the Armed Forces of  the United States.  In a 1947 agreement between Congress  and the United Nations Security Council, the  United States assumed trusteeship of the Marshall Islands. During the period from 1947 to  1979, the United States promoted democratic  self-government and self-determination in the  Marshall Islands. In 1979, the Marshall Islands  adopted  their own constitution and declared  themselves  the Republic of  the Marshall  Islands.  Since that time, the Republic of the Marshall  Islands has proved itself a staunch ally of the  United States and a model for transition from  a non-self-governing territory ravaged by war  to a stable and democratic example of institution building for the Pacific region and the rest  of the world.  On June 17, 2004, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Kessai Note wrote  to U.S. Senator DANIELAKAKAexpressing his  continued concern for the people of Ailuk Atoll  near which the United States tested the thermonuclear weapon Bravo in 1954. The people  of Ailuk and others still suffer from the fallout  of those tests. I support President Note in his  desire to have the people of Ailuk receive the  support and assistance they badly need.  Mr. Speaker, this is worthy resolution, which  is deserving of all our support and I urge all  my colleagues to support its passage. And I  look forward to the continued friendship of the  United States and the Republic of the Marshall  Islands.  Mr. BURTONof Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize the 25th anniversary of the  adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of  the Marshall Islands, and to pay tribute to a  staunch ally of the United States and a people  committed to the principles of democracy and  freedom  for all people of  the Pacific region  and the world.  It is perhaps fitting that on May 29, 2004,  America dedicated the National World War II  Memorial in recognition of the duty, sacrifices,  and  valor of  the members of  the Armed  Forces of  the United States who served  in  World War II. The beginnings of our Nation’s  close relationship with the people of the Marshall Islands are deeply rooted in that titanic  struggle. In 1944, risking their lives to aid the  Armed Forces of the United States and our Allies,  the Marshallese people  joined with  the  U.S. to liberate the Marshall Islands from Japanese military rule. Some of the most horrific  battles of World War II occurred on the Marshall Islands before the Japanese military occupation was finally put to an end. The momentous events brought together the people  of these two great lands in a common bond  that has resulted in more than five decades of  friendship and strategic solidarity between the  Marshall  Islands and  the U.S. That relationship is as strong today as it ever was.  Comprising 30 atolls and 1,152 islands, the  Republic of the Marshall Islands represents a  total  land mass  that  is almost equivalent  in  size to Washington, D.C., but covers roughly  770,000 square miles of the western Pacific  Ocean. Unfortunately, due to the vastness of  the world’s  largest ocean, and  the distance  between us, the culture, history, and people of  the Marshall  Islands are  largely unknown  to  most Americans, except perhaps as the place  where the United States tested more than 67  nuclear weapons during  the development of  our Nation’s strategic arsenal. Although  that  testing left a legacy that we continue to address to this day, it would prove critical to the  success of our country during the Cold War.  The United States nuclear testing program  put the people of these remote islands on the  front line in the Cold War struggle to preserve  international peace, promote nuclear disarmament, support nuclear nonproliferation, and  provide facilities critical to the development of  a deployable missile defense system. The  hardships and suffering endured by Marshall  Island citizens during the testing program directly contributed to the positive and peaceful  end to the Cold War. Their importance to the  emergence of democracy across  the globe  cannot be understated. The people of  the  United States, and  indeed  the entire Free  World, owe the people of the Marshall Islands  an enormous debt of gratitude for their sacrifices.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands has an  unmatched  record of working  in conjunction  with the United States in the pursuit of international peace and security,  the  rights and  well-being of the peoples of the world, and in  the War on Terror. I have been fortunate to  have many great  friends who hail  from  the  Marshall  Islands, and  I will never  forget  the  openness and kindness with which I was received. I congratulate the people of the Marshall Islands on the 25th Anniversary of their  Constitution; and I commend them for the undying commitment to democracy and freedom.  The United States is fortunate to have such a  loyal friend and ally in the Pacific region. I look  forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship between our  two great Nations  for  many more years to come.  ",2004
1306,5,2004-07-06,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker, throughout my  tenure  in Congress,  I have worked  closely with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) on many issues arising in the Pacific region. The RMI has always been, and  continues  to be, a great ally of  the United  States and is dedicated to international peace  and freedom. Therefore, I rise today in support  of H. Con. Res. 410.  By the beginning of the 1900’s, the RMI was  annexed by Spain, Germany, and Japan.  In  1934,  the Allied  invasion and occupation of  the RMI began. In 1947, the RMI became one  of six entities in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established by the United Nations  with  the United  States  as  the  Trustee.  Throughout all these years of being occupied,  the people of RMI never lost their self-identity  or hope for their own country. This hope grew  in the decades after World War II as a local  form of self-government was established. This  led to the convening of a constitutional convention.  In 1979, the people of the RMI adopted a  constitution and chose  their  form of government, a republic. With separation of powers  and a Bill of Rights listing guaranteed rights,  the RMI is based on the same principals and  freedoms that the United States was founded  on hundreds of years ago. Similar  to our  founding, it was the will of the people driving  the process and making the decisions.  The RMI is now a sovereign nation. As a  sovereign nation,  the RMI has aligned  itself  closely with the U.S., particularly in a number  of defense and strategic issues. Recently, we  have renewed our mutually beneficial relationship by reauthorizing the Compact of Free Association. This has guaranteed  that our alliance will continue for another 15 years.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting this resolution and recognize the 25th  anniversary of the adoption of RMI’s constitution. Their  commitment  and  dedication  to  peace and democracy should be commended.  ",2004

1310,12,2004-07-06,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H. Con. Res. 257, a resolution that would urge the President to posthumously award Harry W. Colmery of Topeka,  Kansas, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  In order to receive the Presidential Medal of  Freedom, a person must have contributed in  one of the following areas: the security or national  interest of  the United States, world  peace, or another significant public or private  endeavor. Harry Colmery’s work to bring the  gift of education to so many millions of American service members certainly qualified.  Harry Colmery answered the call of duty in  World War I by serving as a first lieutenant in  the Army Air Service. Aviation was a new concept in those days, and Mr. Colmery showed  exceptional bravery and  faith by serving his  country in the air.  Harry Colmery  also  served  the United  States as a lawyer, having received his law  degree  from  the University of Pittsburgh  in  1916. He used his education well and argued  two successful cases before  the U.S. Supreme Court. In his personal life, Mr. Colmery  was active  in  the American  legion, and  its  members elected him National Commander in  1936.  In December of 1943, Mr. Colmery’s law career and his devotion  to his country  intersected. Millions of young Americans had answered the call of duty and served in World  War II and were starting to return home. Harry  Colmery and the American Legion wanted to  ensure that these returning soldiers would be  able  to  transition back  into civilian  life.  In  Room 570 of the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., Mr. Colmery outlined the legislation that became the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, better known now as the  G.I. Bill of Rights.  The G.I. Bill has helped  to create over  250,000 engineers 238,000 teachers, 91,000  scientists, 67,000 doctors, and 22,000 dentists  since being signed into law. Thanks to these  men and women, bridges, buildings, and ships  have been built; children have realized  their  dreams, scientific mysteries have been solved,  and patients  in need of  care have been  healed.  As an active member of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee,  I  am  proud  that Mr.  Colmery’s work on  the G.I. Bill of Rights  is  something we have built upon. In the 107th  Congress, my colleagues and  I worked  to  pass legislation to expand educational benefits  for veterans. This legislation, The 21st Century  Montgomery G.I. Bill Enhancement Act,  included an increase in basic education benefits, an increase in the rate of survivors’ and  dependents’ educational assistance and an  expansion of the work-study program.  Today, the military operations in Afghanistan  and Iraq are creating a new generation of veterans. Harry Colmery’s foresight has secured  valuable educational benefits  for  these men  and women who are so bravely defending  freedom in the war on terror and gives them  opportunities for their futures.  I am pleased that my colleague, Mr. RYUN,  has been successful in bringing this resolution  to the House floor, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of  this  resolution  to posthumously  award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to  Mr. Harry W. Colmery.  ",2004
1311,12,2004-07-06,Mr. SIMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H. Con. Res. 257, expressing the  sense of Congress that the President should  posthumously award the Presidential Medal of  Freedom to Harry W. Colmery. Harry Colmery  is truly an American treasure. In December of  1943, Mr. Colmery sat  in  room 570 of  the  Mayflower Hotel drafting what arguably became our most successful domestic program  ever, possible even more remarkable than the  Homestead Act.  I believe Mr. Colmery simply wanted a decent opportunity  for  the 14 million GIs we  brought home after World War II. The GI bill  provided veterans with opportunities that were  limited only by their own aspiration, ability and  initiative. The VA provided the opportunity; the  veterans provided the initiative.  On June 20, 2002, I joined Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi, House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman CHRISformer Senator Bob Dole,  former House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs  Chairman G.V. Sonny Montgomery, Congressman JIMRYUN—who authored the legislation  we  are  considering  today—author Michael  Bennett, and National Adjutant Robert W.  Spanogle of The American Legion, at  the  Mayflower Hotel  to dedicate room 570. This  was our first step to recognize the man who  authored  legislation which, unbeknownst  to  him, would create the modern middle class.  After the ceremony, this distinguished group  of individuals wrote letters in support of honoring Mr. Colmery with the Presidential Medal  of Freedom. This was followed by Congressman RYUN introducing H. Con. Res. 257, of  which I am proud to co-sponsor.  Harry Colmery was a visionary and deserves the Nation’s highest honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The GI bill transformed America. Former President George  Bush put it best, ‘‘The GI bill changes the lives  of millions by  replacing old  roadblocks with  paths of opportunity. And,  in so doing,  it  boosted America’s work  force,  it  boosted  America’s economy, and really, it changed the  life of our Nation.’’  Mr. Speaker, let us honor the man who redefined our way of life. I urge my colleagues  to support this resolution.  ",2004

1313,19,2004-07-06,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2004
1314,19,2004-07-06,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, coming  back into town today and picking up a  copy of one of the local papers, I read  the headline, ‘‘Members Seek UN Election Monitors.’’ Quoting from today’s  Roll Call, ‘‘a dozen Democratic House  Members  last week  called  on  the  United Nations to send monitors to  oversee November’s U.S. presidential  election.’’  Mr. Speaker, I submit that I was astounded  to  read  that  in  the paper  today. It seems that there are people in  this House who cannot get over the  facts of the election that was held in  the Year 2000, and the facts are that  George W. Bush won that election. He  won  it  in  the constitutionally prescribed manner of a majority of electoral votes; he won on election day;  and he won on every single recount  held  thereafter,  until  the Supreme  Court said enough recounting 34 days  later, and the counts were stopped.  But the President even won in the  Miami Herald’s recount that came out,  I forget, in February or March of 2001,  well  into the President’s  first term.  The Miami Herald  finally acknowledged the fact that indeed George Bush  had won Florida’s electoral votes and  had indeed won the election.  Those 34 days of transition time were  critical to the start of this administration. We had an economy that was  headed  into a recession, and, as we  found out later in that year, we had enemies of this country who were gathering strength and preparing to attack  this country. Thirty-four days in transition were critical days that were lost.  But now comes this group who says  that the events of the 2000 election are  so serious that UN monitors are required on U.S. soil to monitor our electoral process.  Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that the  constituents of my district just simply  do not understand what goes on  in  Washington, D.C. We have a candidate  for the highest office in this land who  says that foreign leaders would prefer  him to be the President.  Mr. Speaker, we have got a judicial  branch that seems to keep its eye on  what the foreign courts are ruling and  what they are deciding.  Now, I am sad to say, we have Members of this body who simply do not understand what  ‘‘sovereignty’’ means,  and how ironic is that at a time when  we are celebrating sovereignty in the  country of  Iraq, we  just celebrated  Independence Day in this country, and  Members of our own body do not grasp  that simple concept.  Mr. Speaker, when I was sworn in  here 18 months ago, I swore an oath to  uphold the Constitution. I think that is  a good idea, to have that oath, to swear  to uphold the Constitution. I think it  might be a good thing if other Members  of this body remembered why they are  here.  f  CRITIQUING THE ADMINISTRATION  ",2004
1315,19,2004-07-06,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman  from  Washington  (Mr.  MCDERMOTT) is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2004
1316,19,2004-07-06,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  if  the last speaker had ever traveled outside the United States, he might understand why it is that every country in  the world wants George Bush replaced.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to rise today  to address the policies of this administration. I intend to use the ‘‘F’’ word,  so be forewarned.  During the administration’s watch,  America has lost nearly 2 million jobs  in the private sector. Through no fault  of their own, Americans who are out of  work cannot find a job. The administration’s response is to classify flipping  hamburgers as a manufacturing job.  We  could  have  helped Americans  weather the storm by extending unemployment benefits, but the administration turned a deaf ear.  Health care costs have skyrocketed  in America, up to an average of 49 percent in 3 years. One in seven American  families are struggling to pay medical  bills,  families  are  being  forced  to  choose between food, housing and medicine. Unpaid medical bills are a leading cause of personal bankruptcy.  So what does the administration do?  Provide health care for everybody in  Iraq; muzzle  the expert who knows  what the prescription drug bill would  really cost; and passes a drug bill for  seniors  after  drug  companies  raise  prices three times the rate of inflation,  negating any possible benefit from a  prescription drug card. There is an ‘‘F’’  word in there someplace.  Today, one out of every three Americans breathes unhealthy air. Thanks to  this administration, existing rules are  being rolled back so that old, dirty  power plants can keep belching their  pollutants  into the atmosphere. The  American Lung Association calls it the  most harmful and unlawful air pollution initiative ever undertaken by the  Federal Government.  b1945  100 million Americans live in places  where the air is not fit to breathe. The  administration’s response  is to  label  science as fiction and then work to undermine environmental protection. We  know the sources of pollution. Coal-  fired power plants and diesel trucks are  two big culprits. We know how to clean  up the air. What does the administration do? Choose polluters over people.  Choose polluters over protection. The  administration wants to  let oil rigs  into the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The oil companies cannot  wait. The  only  thing  greater  than  America’s greed for oil is the insatiable  desire for profits by oil companies.  Certainly there must be an ‘‘F’’ word  that applies when oil companies post  300 percent profits. The administration’s civilian leaders must have lots of  ‘‘F’’ words when the world first learned  about the prisoner abuse scandals in  Iraq. First they denied knowing anything. That was followed by media revelations of what they knew and approved in advance. The Geneva Conventions was something to embrace, not  follow. That is the bottom line of the  internal White House memos.  Need something else to use the ‘‘F’’  word? The administration has launched  an undeclared draft in America. The  undeclared draft compels current and  former soldiers to fight in Iraq, even if  they  have  already  served.  The  undeclared draft uses rhetoric to mask  reality. The military does not have  enough  soldiers. The administration  knows they will be thrown out of office  if they told America the truth. So the  undeclared draft  is called something  else for now. Wait till after the election if George Bush wins.  The veterans seeking health care, the  administration has a new plan. Bring  your checkbooks and get in line. The  administration wants to cut hundreds  of positions in the VA. They want veterans to pay even more of the financial  burden for the purchase of prescription  drugs, and it wants veterans to pay a  new enrollment  fee. The administration’s proposed budget for the VA is  $2.5 billion too low, but that is nothing  compared to what the administration  intends to do to education in title I  funding which helps disadvantaged kids  across America. This administration  underfunds title I by over $7 billion  next year.  Half of every eligible school district  in America will  receive  less  grant  money. The need is greater, but that  does not matter. Only the rich have  strong advocates  in this administration.  From education to the environment,  from veterans to health care, from the  economy  to  forced military  service,  from moral leadership to global credibility, one word applies to this administration: the ‘‘F’’ word, failure, the administration’s  failure  to create  jobs  that Americans want and deserve; the  administration’s failure to protect our  land, air, water, and people; the administration’s failure to confront military  reality; the administration’s failure to  invest in our future leaders; the administration’s failure to address the needs  VerDate May 21 2004  04:03 Jul 07, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06JY7.038 H06PT1 ",2004

1320,26,2004-07-06,Mr. HUNTER.," I thank the gentleman.  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I want to also join in thanking the gentleman from Hawaii for his  constructive suggestion.  But I want to reiterate again too  that the war we are into, this global  war on terrorism, is not something the  United States sought. It is my humble  opinion that the first attack was really  in 1979, with the attack on our embassy  in Tehran. We can all remember the  signs that were carried at that time  were ‘‘death to America.’’ It does not  need a discussion. That is what the intent is. And the reason for this feeling  is because the United States represents  freedom of association, of speech, as we  just saw, freedom of women to participate in society, and freedom of media.  All of this is being opposed by people  who want to construct a 14th century  life-style.  This is not a religious war. To me, it  is a group of extremists who, as we saw  last week, there was a heinous suicide  bomber who attacked a Shiite mosque  in  Pakistan.  Imagine  just  going  straight into a mosque and killing 20  people. This is just something that has  to be  faced, and we either  face the  enemy overseas or we will again see  them here in the United States, as we  did on September 11.  September 11 was the culmination of  a direct attack on the United States in  1993 on the World Trade Center, a direct attack on our embassies in 1998, at  embassies all throughout Africa, and  then, of course, the infamous attack on  U.S.S. Cole in Yemen in the year 2000,  and finally the attack of September 11,  2001. America is responding.  And I am very grateful that just as  after World War II we helped rebuild  Germany so it would not be a breeding  ground for communism, we are helping  to rebuild Iraq. I am sorry that it does  not get the attention it should. It is  probably just dull to hear that there is  freedom of the press and media in Iraq.  It is dull to hear the schools have been  reopened. It is dull to hear the hospitals have all been reopened and the  health clinics are available. But it is  not dull. It is creating a civil society  that protects the American people. We  were able to protect the American people and defeat communism, and I am  confident we can do the same thing in  defeating terrorism.  I am so happy the gentleman brought  up Ronald Reagan. It was 20 years ago  virtually this minute that he was attempting to win the Cold War by putting Pershing missiles in Western Europe. Millions of people demonstrated  against that in the United States and  Western Europe.  It  ultimately  led,  again, to our victory.  I had the extraordinarily opportunity  Sunday to meet with people at our  church who are from Russia, and I was  telling them how incredible it was for  me to be there with them, because 15  years ago we were told that they like  living under communism; that due to  their serf background, they liked being  slaves; that they really did not want to  have to make decisions of who to elect  and how to elect, what jobs to take,  how much money to earn, whether they  could buy a car or not; that they really  enjoyed living in oppression.  b2045  We know that is not true. The dear  Russians that I met with on Sunday  said how much they appreciated what  President Reagan and the American  people have done to provide for their  liberation. The same analogy applies to  the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. It  is such a positive time to see what our  troops are doing.  ",2004
1321,26,2004-07-06,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield to  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr.  GINGREY), also a great member of the  Committee on Armed Services  ",2004
1322,26,2004-07-06,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, let me  thank the distinguished chairman of  the Committee on Armed Services. I  know if the troops who are so bravely  defending us, our liberty in Iraq and  Afghanistan, if they have any opportunity to read a newspaper or listen to  a radio or watch television, I know  they know that if there is any greater  friend than the chairman of the House  Committee  on Armed Services,  the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  HUNTER), it is possibly the Commander  in Chief, George W. Bush. I thank the  gentleman  for giving me an opportunity to say a few words tonight during this important hour.  Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the  108th Congress appropriated some $187  billion  to Operation  Iraqi Freedom.  $18.5 billion was to restore the infrastructure of this Middle Eastern country long neglected by their dictator,  Saddam Hussein. While Saddam Hussein was incurring huge debts, some  say as much as $100 billion to build up  his own personal military and to construct numerous palaces, compounds to  his own glory and edification, those of  us on both sides of the aisle of the committee, we were there and saw these  palaces. While at the same time the  typical  Iraqi  citizen,  especially  the  Shiite majority and the Kurds, was not  only suffering from a lack of the basic  necessities of life, but they were also  being killed and tortured with reckless  abandonment.  Mr. Speaker, I could talk more time  than I am allotted about how we are  expending this $18.5 billion appropriation to restore the infrastructure, the  needs, basic needs such as water and  sewer plants, electricity, and schools;  but let me use the time that I have got  to discuss something that I know a little bit about and that is called health  care.  I am a physician member of  the  House of Representatives; and along  with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, I care deeply about the health  care, most basic health care needs of  the impoverished Iraqi people.  Mr. Speaker, let us do a little before  and after comparison on health care  expenditures in Iraq. Saddam Hussein’s  regime provided only $16 million for  the ministry of health in 2002. That was  less than $1 per person. This is a 23 to  24 million  population  country. The  Iraqi medical system severely lacked  medical  equipment  and  capabilities.  Doctors’  salaries were  about  $20  a  month.  Today, Iraq’s 2004 budget for health  care is $950 million, a $934 million increase over 2002. All 240 hospitals and  more than 1,200 health clinics are now  open. The minister of health assumed  full  independent authority on March  28, 2004, and the minister of health is  addressing drug shortages by making  emergency drug purchases. Health care  spending in Iraq has increased 30 times  over its prewar levels, and children are  receiving crucial vaccinations for the  first time. Over 5 million children have  been immunized for measles, mumps,  and rubella. Every child in our country  gets that basic right. It is estimated  that 85 percent of Iraqi children now  have been immunized.  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I was listening to some discussion on this floor  of the House earlier and a member on  the other side of the aisle spoke about  fairness. He used that little cute way of  saying the F word, and the F word  being fairness, and said it was not fair  for us to be spending money on the  health of the Iraqi people when it is estimated 40 million Americans do not  have health insurance. But, Mr. Speaker, they have health care. They may  not have health  insurance, but they  have basic health care; and I would remind my colleagues on September 11,  2001, 3,000 of our citizens, citizens of  other countries, had good  jobs with  health care and health insurance, but  they were killed. They are not with us  today. Their families no longer have  their presence, and yet they had great  health care. So it is hugely important  that we provide  this  infrastructure,  this basic health care need to the Iraqi  people.  It would be unconscionable to free  them from the dictatorship of Saddam  Hussein and leave them in poverty and  squalor without having  these  basic  health  care needs met, because we  would just be creating yet another dictator to take Saddam Hussein’s place. I  think it is entirely appropriate that we  spend this money to restore the infrastructure,  including the health care,  the basic health care needs, of the Iraqi  people. With that I yield back to my  chairman.  ",2004

1324,33,2004-07-06,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think it is important to note that the  Democratic minority in this House attempted to add an enhancement of the  penalties for fraud and abuse and profiteering, and yet the majority in this  House and in the Senate denied that  proposal.  I would like to conclude, and I will be  very brief because I think we have got  to go back to the initial question I  think that was raised by the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. INSLEE), how did  we get here?  If we are to believe Richard Clark,  who led the anti-terrorism effort under  both Presidents Clinton and Bush until  his retirement 2 years into the Bush  administration, if we are to believe the  highly  respected,  again, Republican  conservative, who initiated the term of  this administration as Secretary of the  Treasury, Paul O’Neill,  it was one  week, one week after the inauguration  that there was a meeting of the National Security Council and what was  discussed there was the need for regime  change  in  Iraq. Nothing about  terrorism. And again, 6 weeks later, according to Paul O’Neill, there was a  meeting of the National Security Council where it was discussed how the oil  fields in Iraq were to be divvied up and  divided among nations and corporations. That is according to Paul O’Neill  and that is according to Dick Clark.  ",2004
1325,33,2004-07-06,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," There  is an important article that was written  in Harper’s Magazine by David  Armstrong back just before the outbreak of the war. The title of the article was ‘‘DICKCHENEY’SSong for America.’’ In there he goes back and talks  about the concept for this plan being  hatched by the then-Secretary of Defense and the two Under Secretaries  which at the time were Paul Wolfowitz  and Richard Perle. The goal was to be  the lone force in the Middle East. The  plan that was put forward was a bold  one: To go forward and overtake Baghdad.  It was rejected at the time. It was rejected by Colin Powell. It was rejected  by Bush the elder. It was rejected by  the most outspoken people against this  war back in 2002 in this invasion and  that was Jim Baker, Brent Scowcroft  and Eagleburger.  So as the gentleman said at the beginning, this is not a partisan effort.  This is an understanding of the wrong  turn the Nation has taken with respect  to foreign policy. Again, I commend  the members of the  Iraq Watch  for  their vigilance.  ",2004

1327,33,2004-07-06,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  note getting back to the war on terrorism, where  is Osama bin Laden?  Where is Osama bin Laden? Why is the  President not talking about Osama bin  Laden, who is free tonight threatening  our citizens where they  live  in our  neighborhoods?  We found out last week that this administration  is  spending  five  times  more money tracking people who travel to Cuba than they are trying to  interdict the money going to Osama  bin Laden, who is continuing a threat  to this country.  This is one example of this administration taking their eye off the ball of  the guy who killed almost 3,000 Americans. We are going to continue this discussion.  ",2004
1328,33,2004-07-06,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Mr. Speaker, I  believe we are down to our last minute  or so. I do want to indicate to members  of Iraq Watch that are here tonight  that the chairman of the Committee on  Armed Services in the previous hour  indicated that he and perhaps other  Members might be interested in having  a dialogue with us and perhaps even  combining hours, if that is acceptable  under the House rules, perhaps this  week or as soon as possible. And if it is  okay with everybody, I wanted to pursue that, and I have indicated to the  Speaker as we began the hour that that  was contemplated and we will try to  pursue that with the leadership.  b2200  Mr. Speaker, I believe we have come  to essentially the end of our hour.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  GINGREY).

1330,33,2004-07-06,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Georgia  for the opportunity to speak for 5 minutes. Two of  our esteemed colleagues are en route  here, and I would like to take this 5  minutes to further thank the Members  who have been  involved  in the Iraq  Watch.  I say so from the bottom of my heart  because I think at the end of the day  there has been a great discussion that  has been going on within this body, but  unfortunately, in so many respects, it  has not  fully reached the American  people, or it has in drips and drabs; and  I commend our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle who were down here in  the previous hour.  I think, as the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. ABERCROMBIE) has suggested,  we need to have that kind of frank discussion and debate that all too often  really does not take place on this floor.  It is an important dialogue that the  American public needs to hear.  I believe in the final analysis it is not  the shock and awe of our military and  the strength that  it has that determines America’s greatness, but rather,  the strength of our ideas and our ability to express those ideas not only here  on the floor but for citizens who are  out there listening, for them to partake and ultimately put in their own  words, with their own voice, from their  own heart and head,  their  feelings  about these issues.  So often I go back to my district and  so many of them will ask why is no one  speaking out about these issues, and  not understanding the workings of the  House of Representatives and not understanding that so many times meetings are actually going on in committees that do not happen to make it on  to C–SPAN, but also wondering where  the voice and conscience of the country  is, and the Iraq Watch has done an outstanding job in terms of making sure  that there has been this opportunity to  reach out to the American public and  inform  them  in a nonpartisan way  about these issues and raise these questions that are so  important  for the  American people to digest, especially  as we face upcoming elections that will  determine the fate and course of the  Nation.  If we consider that in the previous  election, less than 50 percent of the  American  people  voted  and  understanding that in the aftermath of September 11 there has been a great outpouring of patriotism and citizenship,  and what better way to express that  than by going out and voting and immersing and involving one’s self in the  issues of the day, it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to make  sure that we inform and educate the  general public; but it is equally responsible that the public have an opportunity to express their concerns.

The  growth of Federal spending also concerns me. I agree in general concept  with your ideas you spoke about. We  all want what is best.’’ But a Republican concerned about Federal spending.  The one I want to end on here, ‘‘Dear  Members, this is a note to ask for help  in getting a state of emergency declared for the unemployed.’’ State of  emergency. He  is a union member.  ‘‘Talented trades and craft union people  are  proud,  hard-working, well-  trained people who  seem  to always  have work. Things have really slowed  all over the country or gone to low  paying, no benefit, nonunion contractors. We serve 4 to 5 year apprenticeships to learn our jobs properly as well  as yearly updates to stay current, and  we don’t need to retrain.’’ He says, and  this is interesting, ‘‘I wish you would  look into this matter, as time is crucial. We need your support right now.  We union folk are in great numbers and  a little help from you could mean a  lot.’’  These are people that are out struggling. And the CEO of Aetna, and I do  not know if you saw this quote, the  CEO of Aetna said, ‘‘We are pretty sure  that the jobs that are going to be created will not have health care benefits  associated with them.’’  So talk about two Americas. I mean,  literally, you are going to have millions and millions more than we have  now of people who are going to be without health care. There is not a bigger  stress that you could have as a parent  than thinking, I cannot take my kid to  the clinic, I cannot take my kid to the  doctor, to the hospital, because I cannot afford it, and then when you do go,  you go to the emergency room. That is  no way.  I think we do have universal health  care in this country, but it is just administered  through  the  emergency  rooms, and that is the worst way to do  it, it is the most inefficient way to do  it, and it is the most costly way to do  it. Instead of providing the prevention  up front, which would save everybody  money in the long run, we wait. Instead of going to the doctor with a  cold, you go to the emergency room  with pneumonia, and it costs the taxpayers a lot more money. It just is a  bad  way  to  administer.

1338,47,2004-07-06,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, I want to  spend a few minutes on what the Senate will be addressing over the next  several hours. That  is the consideration  of  the  nomination  of  Leon  Holmes to be a Federal district court  judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas. His nomination has  been  languishing since January 2003. It is long  past time that the Senate give Mr.  Holmes  the up-or-down vote he deserves.  Mr. Holmes is known in his home  State of Arkansas as a brilliant and  impartial jurist who follows the law.  His nomination has brought substantial opposition from some liberal activists in Washington. But in Arkansas,  he has earned respect and support from  liberals and conservatives alike.  These  supporters  include  Kent  Rubens, who  led the  fight to strike  down Arkansas’s pro-life laws in the  wake of Roe v. Wade. Rubens writes in  a letter to Chairman HATCHand Senator LEAHYon March 21, 2003: I cannot think of anyone who is better  qualified to serve . . . As someone who has  represented the pro-choice view, I ask that  you urge your members to support this confirmation. Or you can listen to this letter from  Ellen Woods Harrison  to Chairman  HATCHand Senator LEAHY: I am a female attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. I am a life-long Democrat and am  also pro-choice . . . I commend Mr. Holmes  to you. He is a brilliant man, a great lawyer  and a fine person. And the editorial board of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette  supports Mr.  Holmes’ nomination. They write: What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is the rare  blend of qualities he brings to the law—intellect,  scholarship, conviction, and detachment . . . He would not only bring distinction to the bench, but a promise of greatness. I should also note that Arkansas’s  Democratic Senators, Mark Pryor and  Blanche  Lincoln,  strongly  support  Leon Holmes.  In light of this broad support for Mr.  Holmes, one wonders if some activists  in Washington are more interested in a  witch hunt than in fairness. This body  should not erect  religious  tests  for  judges. One’s personal  religious beliefs—in Leon Holmes’ case, his Catholic beliefs—should not disqualify anyone from serving on the bench. I fear  that the arguments put forth by some  of my colleagues may lead to the disqualification of judicial nominees who  are Catholic or Baptist or who hold  deeply held religious views.  Nominees should be judged on their  temperament and their ability to impartially uphold the law. The Framers  of the Constitution wisely rejected religious tests for officeholders. I would  hate to see this body try to upend that  wise judgment of our Founders.  A judge should know how to separate  his personal views from those of the  law, and Leon Holmes’ record of impartiality speaks for itself.  Mr. Holmes finished law school at the  top of his class. He was inducted into  Phi Beta Kappa while a doctoral student at Duke University. His doctoral  dissertation discusses the political philosophies of W.E.B. DuBois and Booker  T. Washington, and it analyzes the effort Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made  to reconcile their divergent views. Mr.  Holmes was habeas counsel for death  row inmate Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally  retarded man whose execution  then-Governor Clinton refused to commute during the 1992 Presidential election.  Clearly, his record speaks of a man  who is compassionate, thoughtful, and  fairminded. Taken together, I believe  Leon Holmes will be a just and impartial  jurist. He deserves the Senate’s  support, and I trust that my colleagues  will join me in voting to confirm him  later today.  I yield the floor.  f  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY  LEADER  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished minority leader is recognized. f  ON OPTIMISM AND THE ECONOMY  ",2004
1339,47,2004-07-06,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, we  hear a lot these days about how essential optimism is to economic growth  and progress. These discussions remind  me of that old saying that ‘‘an optimist is someone who believes we’re living in the best of all possible worlds,  and a pessimist is someone who fears  this may be true.’’ By those definitions, there are probably very few optimists or pessimists in America because  we all know that America’s economy  today is not the best possible.  This morning, I want to say a few  words about how we can strengthen our  economy and create new  jobs and a  brighter future for hard-working middle-class families in America.  We are all relieved that the economy  has finally started adding more jobs  each month than it is shedding. After  21⁄2 years in which our economy lost  jobs every month, these new jobs are  good news—especially for the millions  of Americans who are looking for work.  But there are still over a million fewer  jobs in America today than there were  4 years ago. In addition, the latest jobgrowth  figures, released  last Friday,  were considerably weaker than most  analysts  had  predicted.  That  disappointing news reminds us that optimism alone is not a national economic  policy. What we need is realism.  Many proposals have been introduced  in this Senate to create jobs and to  help people who have lost jobs find new  ones. We owe it to the American people  to consider a variety of ideas. And in  weighing our economic options,  the  question we ought to ask ourselves is  not whether an idea is optimistic or  pessimistic. The question we  should  ask about every proposal is: Does it do  right by America? Will it lead to the  kind of economic growth that benefits  all Americans, not just the fortunate  few? Does it provide incentives to encourage companies to create  jobs  in  America—rather  than  encouraging  companies to ship American jobs overseas? Does it help the people and communities that have lost jobs these last  4 years? Does it give them the tools  and the opportunities to replace those  lost jobs with better jobs? Or does it  just write them off? Does it do right by  the millions of middle-class  families  who are working harder every year but  are still losing ground economically?  Optimism alone can’t stretch a paycheck, or pay a mortgage, or put your  children through college.  Some people point to the fact that  the economy has finally started to create jobs as proof that we have solved  the jobs problem. They say that all we  have to do now is stay the course and  be patient. I wish the people who say  that would come to North Sioux City,  SD, and some of the communities that  surround it. Until very recently, North  Sioux City was the headquarters for  Gateway computers, one of the largest  private employers  in South Dakota.  Four years ago, Gateway  employed  6,000  people  in  the Siouxland  area  around North Sioux City. But the recession and the shakeout in the technology sector hit Gateway hard, as it  did many tech companies. Today, only  1,700 people work for Gateway in the  North Sioux City area. I am not sure if it is a blessing or a  curse, but the job losses at Gateway  didn’t come in one crushing blow. They  came instead as a steady stream of layoffs. While none was large enough to  grab national media attention, the cumulative impact of these layoffs on the  families  and  communities  in  the  Siouxland area around North Sioux  City has been devastating. Some of the  laid-off workers  received  severance  packages. Some have found new jobs  that pay less. Many are still looking  for work. There are many more good  workers today in the Siouxland area  than there are good jobs.  These times are tough even for many  people who are working. Over the past  year, real weekly earnings actually fell  for the average worker, according to  the Department of Labor. In South Dakota and across America, workers are  earning less than they did a year ago,  but  they are paying more—for gas,  health care, tuition, and other basic  necessities.  Even with the recent easing of prices,  gas still costs 30 cents a gallon more in  South Dakota today than it did a year  ago.

I urge  her to reconsider the position she has  taken, although I know she has taken  it carefully and I doubt that is likely.  But I urge her and others to consider  what we are doing here, about how we  vote on judges.  Let me just say that Americans and  people around the world have various  beliefs, and to some people different beliefs are viewed as strange. Those with  religious beliefs may have different  views on some issues than those who  don’t have religious beliefs. There is  quite a lot of that. We don’t all agree.  We have different views about whether  there  is a Trinity, or what do you  think about the virgin birth, and issues  of all kinds. We have a  lot of differences of opinion.  We have a view in this country that  there cannot be a religious test for a  judge or any other position in Government. There cannot be a religious test  that you can put on them, saying you  have to have a certain religion or certain belief before you can be an official  in this Government. No, that is not  true. We should not do that.  I guess what I will first say—and I  hope I can be clear about this—we differ in our religious principles. It has  been suggested that Mr. Holmes’ religious principles are extreme. I say to  you that his principles are consistent  with the Catholic Church’s principles.  What he has said in every writing I  have seen, and as I understand it, they  are perfectly consistent—in fact, he defended classic Catholic doctrine. He defended classic Catholic doctrine. Regardless of whether he had a personal  view that was somewhat unusual about  his religious faith, that is not the test  we have here. The question is, Will his  personal religious beliefs he may adhere to strongly interfere with his ability to be a good judge?  He and his wife wrote a letter to a  church in a church newspaper to discuss how they have ordered their marriage, and they have ordered it in the  classical terms of Christianity. As a  matter of  fact,  I think the Baptist  Church recently affirmed a similar position in their denomination. It is the  second  largest denomination  in  the  U.S.—second to the Catholic Church.  That is not an extreme view. Whether  you agree with it, it is scriptural, it is  Christian doctrine. He defended and explained and wrote about that.  Isn’t it good that we have a nominee  for the Federal bench who is active in  his church, who thinks about the issues  facing his country and writes about  them and talks about them? That is a  healthy thing. The question is—and it  is legitimate for those who are concerned about those views—if they don’t  agree with his view on abortion or on  how marriage is arranged, to inquire of  the nominee whether those views are  so strong they would affect his or her  opinions from the bench. That is the  test. If we get away from that, we have  a problem.  What  is going to happen when we  have a Muslim who has been nominated  here or an Orthodox Jew, or any other  denomination that doesn’t agree with  us on religious beliefs? Are we going to  demand that they come before the Senate Judiciary Committee and renounce  their faith as a price to be paid before  they can be a Federal judge? No, sir,  that is wrong. This is big-time stuff;  this is not a little iddy-biddy matter,  Mr. President. We should not be in that  position. Yes, inquire if the person’s  views are so strongly held that they  would impair his ability to be a Federal judge. Yes, ask whether they are a  good lawyer, or do they have a good  reputation among the bar, or do people  respect their integrity, do they have  good judgment, do people like and admire  them. Ask  those  things. Ask  whether the person has lack of judgment. But don’t say: I don’t agree with  your  theology on marriage;  I don’t  agree with your church’s view on abortion; therefore, I am not going to vote  for you. That is a dangerous thing. It  should not be done. It is a mistake for  us to head down that direction. I cannot emphasize that too much.  This is wrong. We should not do this.  It is not the right way to evaluate Federal judges. I understand when somebody says: I just feel strongly about  this deal on marriage that he and his  wife wrote. I feel, feel, feel. We need to  stop thinking like that and not be so  much worried about how we feel, and  we  better  think  about  the  consequences of our actions and our votes. This is a dangerous precedent. I respect Judge Holmes. He is a man who  has reached out to the poor, helped  women lawyers to an extraordinary degree, helped them become partners in  his firm. He has a wonderful wife who  respects him and defended him in a real  hot letter in response to the criticism  of  the  article  that  she  and Judge  Holmes wrote. I think we ought to look  at that.  We have confirmed people  to  the  bench that have made big mistakes in  my judgement—we have confirmed people to the bench that have used drugs,  yet, we are now debating keeping this  man off the bench  for his religious  writings. Would Mr. Holmes be in a  better position with members of this  body if he had smoked dope instead of  written religious articles? That should  not be so.  Let’s look at his basic background  and  reputation  for  excellence.  Of  course, we know the two Democratic  Senators from his home State of Arkansas support his nomination. So he  has home State support.  We know the American Bar Association rated him their highest rating,  ‘‘well-qualified.’’  We know he is probably the finest appellate lawyer in the State of Arkansas.  We  know  the Arkansas  Supreme  Court, when at various times they need  a lawyer to sit on that court, they have  called him two or three times to sit on  the court.  He is one of the most respected lawyers in the State of Arkansas.  He was Phi Beta Kappa at Duke University. I think he was No. 1 in his  class in law school.  This is a man of integrity, of religious faith and conviction, who is active in his church, who has reached out  to the poor all his life, tried to do the  right thing, and he  is the one who  comes up here and gets beaten up.  This  is what his hometown newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette,  said. These are the kinds of comments  from the people who know him: What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is a rare  blend of qualities he brings to the law—intellect, scholarship, conviction, detachment, a  reverence not just for the law but for ideas,  for the life of the mind. All of that would  shine through the clutter of argument that  awaits any judge. He would not only bring  distinction to the bench, but promise. In  choosing Leon Holmes, the President could  bequeath a promise of greatness. I think that is high praise. That is a  beautiful comment. I suggest that is  something anyone would be proud to  have said about them.  He has practiced commercial litigation at the trial and appellate level in  State and Federal courts. He has acquired  significant  courtroom  experience. He  is currently a partner at  Quattlebaum, Grooms, Tull & Burrow  in Little Rock. He was rated  ‘‘wellqualified’’ by the ABA.  He knows the value of hard work. He  came  from humble roots and  is the  only one of his seven siblings to attend  college. He worked his way through  college, finished law school at night  while working a full-time job to support his family.

1342,75,2004-07-06,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise today  to respond briefly to the comments  made by Members on the other side of  the aisle about the nomination of J.  Leon Holmes to be a District Court  Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  Mr. Holmes has been criticized for a  number of comments—some of which  are more than two decades old. Yet his  opponents  ignore  the  best  evidence  about Mr. Holmes: the people who have  known him well throughout the past  two decades of his legal career. As Senator LINCOLN of Arkansas  recently  noted  in reaffirming her support  for  Mr. Holmes, letters of support from: the legal community in Arkansas, many of  whom share different views than Mr. Holmes  . . .  describe  him  as  ‘‘fair,’’  ‘‘compassionate,’’ ‘‘even-handed,’’ and ‘‘disciplined.’’  His colleagues hold him in high esteem. PRYOR That is from a press release of Senator BLANCHELINCOLN, April 11, 2003.  The other home State Senator, Senator  also, of course, a Democrat— supports Mr. Holmes.  Additionally, the strong support of  Mr. Holmes’ colleagues  in the  legal  community caused the American Bar  Association to give him its highest rating of ‘‘well-qualified.’’ Finally, the Arkansas  Democrat-Gazette,  Holmes’  hometown paper, is intimately familiar  with his record and strongly supports  him. The  paper, writing while Mr.  Holmes was being considered, indicated  that Mr. Holmes was a well qualified,  mainstream nominee: What distinguishes Mr. Holmes is the rare  blend of qualities he brings to the law—intellect,  scholarship, conviction, and detachment. A reverence not just for the law but  for ideas, for the life of the mind. All of that  would shine through the clutter of argument  that awaits any judge . . . . He would not  only bring distinction  to  the bench but  promise. . . . In choosing Leon Holmes, [the  President]  could  bequeath  a  promise  of  greatness. That is from an editorial, Name on a  List in a Field of Seven, One Stands  Out, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Dec.  1, 2002, at 86.  It is easy to use out-of-context comments to paint an incomplete and inaccurate picture of a person. By looking  at the entire context of Mr. Holmes’  career, it is clear that he is held in  high regard by those who know him  and his work. This includes those who  hold views contrary to those of Mr.  Holmes,  such as Stephen Engstrom,  who on March 24, 2003 wrote to Chairman HATCHand Senator LEAHY: I heartily commend Mr. Holmes to you. He  is an outstanding lawyer and a man of excellent character. Leon Holmes and I differ on  political and personal  issues such as prochoice/anti-abortion. I am a past board member of our local Planned Parenthood chapter  and have been a trial lawyer in Arkansas for  over twenty-five years. Regardless of our  personal differences on some issues, I am  confident that Leon Holmes will do his duty  as the law and facts of any given case require. Letters like this, from people who  have known Mr. Holmes well in the  context in which he would serve, are  the  best  evidence  regarding  Mr.  Holmes.  It  is always appropriate to  consider questions raised about comments that a nominee has made in the  past, and there certainly has been controversy about some of Mr. Holmes’  statements. In this situation, I defer to  those who know the nominee, and who  are  in the best position to put his  statements into context. In this case,  Mr. Holmes has overwhelming bipartisan support from those in his home  State, especially  those  in  the  legal  community, who have known him over  the past two decades. Based on this evidence, I will support Mr. Holmes’ confirmation to the Federal bench. ",2004
1343,75,2004-07-06,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to speak on the nomination of  Leon Holmes to be a district court  judge for the U.S. District Court of Arkansas.  The ‘‘advice and consent’’ role given  to the Senate in the U.S. Constitution  is one of the Senate’s most solemn duties, and one to which I give the utmost care. Since Federal judges serve  for lifetime terms, I carefully review  every nominee to ensure that he or she  is well-qualified  and  possesses  the  proper professional competence and integrity. Although, naturally, I apply  no litmus test with respect to a nominee’s personal beliefs, a commitment  to following the law and applying it  soundly is critical.  Perhaps the most important factor in  evaluating a nominee is whether the  person has the proper  ‘‘judicial temperament.’’ There are  two elements  that must be considered when making  this determination. The first involves  what we would commonly understand  the characteristics of good temperament  to entail: would  the nominee  show courtesy and respect toward the  practitioners and parties in his courtroom, while at the same time remaining confident and firm. From all I have  heard about Mr. Holmes, he has a fine  reputation for being both civil and professional, and I have no concerns about  his nomination in this regard.  The second element of judicial temperament  is more  troubling  in  this  case.  It  involves  the  deliberative  mindset that is so valued in our jurists—the ability to separate emotion  and personal views while applying the  laws in a neutral and impartial manner. A judge must be able to transcend  personal views in ruling on the matters  before the court. It is for this reason  that I am concerned about whether Mr.  Holmes has the proper  judicial temperament to receive a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.  After a careful review of the Judiciary Committee proceedings and Mr.  Holmes’ record, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Holmes has not demonstrated the requisite ability to put  aside his personal views and follow settled law. Over many years, Mr. Holmes  has made a number of public statements, many in letters to the editor or  in published articles, that raise serious  questions about his ability to set aside  his deeply held beliefs in order to impartially apply laws with which he disagrees. In fact, Mr. Holmes himself has  characterized  some  of  his  previous  comments as ‘‘strident and harsh rhetoric.’’ These statements were not made  in the midst of casual conversation;  they were largely written pieces that  reflected the thoughts of Mr. Holmes  on these matters.  In one extremely troubling instance,  Mr. Holmes wrote that  ‘‘concern for  rape victims is a red herring because  conceptions from rape occur with approximately  the  same  frequency as  snowfall  in Miami.’’ This  appalling  statement was not a chance comment,  instantly  regretted.  Rather,  Mr.  Holmes included this statement in a  letter he submitted for publication in  The Daily Dispatch. In addition to the  insensitivity  and  inaccuracy  demonstrated by this comment, I believe it  demonstrates that Mr. Holmes  lacks  the measured approach that is critical  for sound judicial decision-making and  the ability to set aside his personal  views to apply settled principles of law.  In an April 11, 2004 letter to Senator  LINCOLN, Mr. Holmes stated, ‘‘I do not  propose to defend that sentence, and I  would not expect you or anyone else to  do so.’’ While in this same letter Mr.  Holmes went on to apologize for this  remark, he also acknowledged that his  comment ‘‘reflects an insensitivity for  which there is no excuse.’’ I agree with  Mr. Holmes that there is no excuse for  this statement, and his belated apology  came only after he was nominated for  the Federal bench.  Unfortunately, this type of comment  is not an isolated one, but one in a series  of  unsettling  statements Mr.  Holmes has made in his writings over  many years. For example, Mr. Holmes  authored an article in 1997 in which he  wrote that ‘‘the wife is to subordinate  herself  to her husband,’’  and  ‘‘the  woman is to place herself under the authority  of  the man.’’  In  1982, Mr.  Holmes authored another letter for the  Arkansas Gazette, entitled ‘‘The Scary  New Argument for Abortion,’’ in which  he compared certain arguments justifying abortion to arguments used to  justify the actions of Nazi Regime. In  2001, he authored a comment for another publication in which he criticized  both  Roe  and  Casey  as  ‘‘constitutionaliz[ing]  the  theory  of  moral relativism.’’  Mr. President, let me be clear that I  respect Mr. Holmes’ personal views on  abortion rights and am not opposing  his nomination on those grounds. In  fact, I have voted for many judicial  nominees whose personal views were  different  from mine on the right to  choose, among other issues. Nor do I  believe that a nominee should be required to indicate how he would decide  issues of  substantive  law  that may  arise in future cases. That is not the  issue. The issue is whether Mr. Holmes  VerDate jul 14 2003  06:44 Jul 07, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JY6.013 S06PT1 ",2004
1344,82,2004-07-06,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Vermont.  ,2004
1345,82,2004-07-06,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, the current version of class action legislation  has undergone a number of changes  since it was reported by the Judiciary  Committee. Some  of  these  changes  have been  improvements.  I want to  note that. Some have not. I know that  Senators DODD, LANDRIEU, SCHUMER,  KOHL, and CARPER negotiated  some  procedural improvements to S. 1751. I  believe these do help. I appreciate their  efforts to rein in some of the worst aspects of the bill.  For example, these improvements restricted the use of worthless coupon  settlements. I agree with that. To hear  some of the commentators about this  bill, you would think that was not in  there, but I want everybody to know it  is. They also eliminated some provisions that were harmful to civil rights  and consumer plaintiffs who endure  hardships as a result of initiating and  pursuing litigation.  But in other aspects, the compromise  failed to achieve their intended goals.  For example, one provision seeks to reduce the delay plaintiffs can experience  when a case  is removed to Federal  court. It sets a time limit for appeals  and remand orders. But there is not a  concomitant measure that would set a  timeline for the district court to rule  on the actual remand motion.  This may seem like a bit of arcane  lawyer’s jargon, but it is a lot more  than that. It means that you could be  a plaintiff, be  in State court  legitimately. You suddenly get plucked out  of State court. But then they could put  you on the Federal docket. Somebody  could say, OK, we are just going to  leave it there year after year after year  after year, and there is nothing you  could do about it. There is no recourse.  I understand that Senator FEINGOLD  will offer an amendment to set a reasonable  time  limit  for  the district  court to rule on these remand orders.  It seems like common sense. Rule them  up or rule them down, but have a time  to do it. I hope all Senators will support him.  In addition, I am disturbed the bill  may deny  justice to consumers and  others in class actions involving multiple State laws. The recent trend in  the Federal courts  is to not certify  class actions if multiple State laws are  involved; thus, the class action bill  could  force nationwide class actions  into Federal court and then just be dismissed for involving too many State  laws. It is kind of a way of making sure  that you never reach the merits of the  VerDate jul 14 2003  05:20 Jul 07, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G06JY6.083 S06PT1 ",2004
1346,89,2004-07-06,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent to print the  full  text of the article in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  THEAMERICAI LOVE  (By Elie Wiesel)  Born in Sighet, Transylvania (Romania),  Elie Wiesel became a U.S. citizen in 1963.  Since then, Wiesel—a Holocaust survivor,  Boston University professor and the author  of more than 40 books—has become one of  our nation’s most honored citizens. In 1985,  President Ronald Reagan awarded him the  Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor  Congress can bestow on a civilian. In 1992,  President George Bush  recognized Wiesel  with  the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Wiesel, who has been an outspoken advocate  of human rights around the world, won the  Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.  The day I received American citizenship  was a turning point in my life. I had ceased  to be stateless. Until then, unprotected by  any government and unwanted by any society, the Jew in me was overcome by a feeling  of pride mixed with gratitude.  From that day on, I felt privileged to belong to a country which, for two centuries,  has stood as a living symbol of all that is  charitable and decent to victims of injustice  everywhere—a country in which every person is entitled to dream of happiness, peace  and liberty; where those who have are taught  to give back.  In America, compassion for the refugee and  respect for the other still have biblical connotations.  Grandiloquent words used for public oratory? Even now, as America is in the midst  of puzzling uncertainty and understandable  introspection because of tragic events  in  Iraq, these words reflect my personal belief.  For I cannot forget another day that remains alive in my memory: April 11, 1945.  That day I encountered the first American  soldiers  in  the Buchenwald concentration  camp. I remember them well. Bewildered,  disbelieving, they walked around the place,  hell on earth, where our destiny had been  played out. They looked at us, just liberated,  and did not know what to do or say. Survivors  snatched  from  the dark  throes of  death, we were empty of all hope—too weak,  too emaciated to hug them or even speak to  them. Like lost children, the American soldiers wept and wept with rage and sadness.  And we received their tears as if they were  heartrending offerings from a wounded and  generous humanity.  Ever since that encounter, I cannot repress  my emotion before the  flag and the uniform—anything  that  represents American  heroism in battle. That is especially true on  July Fourth.  I reread the Declaration of  Independence, a document sanctified by the  passion of a nation’s thirst for justice and  sovereignty, forever admiring both its moral  content and majestic intonation. Opposition  to oppression in all its forms, defense of all  human liberties, celebration of what is right  is social intercourse: All this and much more  is  in that text, which today has special  meaning.  Granted, U.S. history has gone through severe trials, of which anti-black racism was  the most scandalous and depressing. I happened to witness it in the late Fifties, as I  traveled through the South. What did I feel?  Shame. Yes, shame for being white. What  made it worse was the realization that, at  that time, racism was the law, thus making  the law itself immoral and unjust.  Still, my generation was lucky to see the  downfall of prejudice in many of its forms.  True, it took much pain and protest for that  law to be changed, but it was. Today, while  fanatically stubborn racists are still around,  some of them vocal, racism as such has vanished from the American scene. That is true  of anti-Semitism too. Jew-haters still exist  here and there, but organized anti-Semitism  does not—unlike  in Europe, where  it has  been growing with disturbing speed.  As a great power, America has always  seemed concerned with other people’s welfare, especially in Europe. Twice in the 20th  century, it saved the ‘‘Old World’’ from dictatorship and tyranny.  America understands that a nation is great  not because its economy is flourishing or its  army is invincible but because its ideals are  loftier. Hence America’s desire to help those  who have lost their freedom to conquer it  again. America’s credo might read as follows: For an individual, as for a nation, to be  free is an admirable duty—but to help others  become free is even more admirable.  Some skeptics may object: But what about  Vietnam? And Cambodia? And the support  some administrations gave to corrupt regimes in Africa or the Middle East? And the  occupation of Iraq? Did we go wrong—and if  so, where?  And what are we to make of the despicable,  abominable ‘‘interrogation methods’’ used on  Iraqi prisoners of war by a few soldiers (but  even a few are too many) in Iraqi military  prisons?  Well, one could say that no nation is composed of saints alone. None is sheltered from  mistakes or misdeeds. All have their Cain  and Abel. It takes vision and courage to undergo serious soul-searching and to  favor  moral conscience over political expediency.  And America, in extreme situations, is endowed with both. America is always ready to  learn  from  its mishaps. Self-criticism remains its second nature.  Not surprising, some Europeans do not  share such views. In extreme left-wing political and intellectual circles, suspicion and  distrust toward America is the order of the  day. They deride America’s motives for its  military interventions, particularly in Iraq.  They say: It’s just money. As if America  went to war only to please the oil-rich capitalists.  They are wrong. America went to war to  liberate a population too long subjected to  terror and death.  We see in newspapers and magazines and  on television screens, the mass graves and  torture chambers imposed by Saddam Hussein and his accomplices. One cannot but feel  grateful to the young Americans who leave  their families, some to lose their lives, in  order to bring to Iraq the first rays of hope— without which no people can imagine the  happiness of welcoming freedom.  Hope is a key word in the vocabulary of  men and women like myself and so many  others who  discovered  in America  the  strength to overcome cynicism and despair.  Remember the legendary Pandora’s box? It  is filled with implacable, terrifying curses.  But underneath, at the very bottom, there is  hope. Now as before, now more than ever, it  is waiting for us. f  111TH VIBORG DANISH DAYS  ",2004
1347,89,2004-07-06,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, I take  this opportunity to recognize the upcoming  Danish  Days  Festival  in  Viborg, SD. This annual event attracts  hundreds of people to the small South  Dakota town to celebrate the area’s  rich Danish history. I especially applaud the Danish Days planning committee and the Danish Heritage Association for their work to make this  event a success.  Denmark-native  Peter  Larsen  Christensen first settled near Viborg in  1864, establishing a small general store  on his homestead. Southwestern Railroad completed a line connecting Sioux  Falls  and Yankton  in  1893, which  passed through the present-day Viborg.  The community  incorporated on August 25, 1893, shortly after the railroad’s arrival, and quickly grew into a  bustling Danish community on the new  South Dakota prairie.  Today, this town of 800 remains a vibrant  community.  In  a  time when  small town stores continue to close,  Viborg’s Main  Street  features  full  storefronts offering a variety of services,  including a pharmacy, grocery  store and bank. The city’s industrial  park also continues to grow. Viborg’s  strong business community exists because of the town’s strong foundation  of community, established more than  100 years ago.  Each year, the Danish Days Festival  provides Viborg  residents, past and  present, with an opportunity to celebrate the community’s proud heritage.  The event will  feature a  leadership  luncheon  for Turner County’s public  servants and an honoring reception for  the decedents of 2004 Danish Days honorees, C.J. and Cena Glood. A parade,  community barbecue, car  show, and  fireworks display are also planned.  The C.J.  and Cena Glood  family  opened Viborg’s first hardware and implement store shortly after the community was incorporated, and their decedents  have  continued  to  impact  Viborg’s  prosperity  through  proud  leadership. Most  prominently,  their  eldest son, Royal, served 10 years in  South Dakota State Legislature, advocating  for  the  interests  of Turner  County.  Their daughter, Dagmar, maintained  a medical practice in Viborg for nearly  20 years and made numerous contributions to the community. The family  has  had  a  substantial  impact  on  Viborg’s development and are worthy  honorees.  Finally, the Danish Heritage Association will unveil Viborg’s first Danish  heritage museum during the festivities.

1362,4,2004-07-12,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of House Resolution 704, which  is legislation that I introduced. And  this legislation congratulates my alma  mater, the Cal State Fullerton Titans  baseball team, on winning the 2004 College World Series. I am pleased that  my  colleagues  from Orange County  have joined me in acknowledging this  triumphant season for the Titans.  For those of us who grew up in Orange County, this is a momentous occasion. This is the fourth time in the  school’s history that the Titans have  won the College World Series championship.  b1415  The Titans’ victory was far from predicted. They were the underdog from  the  start. They  started  this  season  with  a  15–16  won-loss  record  at  midseason. Despite their early struggles, the Titans continued to display  character and resiliency by working  hard. This scrappy Cal State-Fullerton  baseball team went on to beat the odds  and did so in the most humble fashion  possible,  through good old-fashioned  teamwork.  Cal State-Fullerton went on to win  the Big West Conference over perennial  conference  powerhouse Long Beach  State. This contentious conference is  hard fought year after year, with the  Titans always displaying consistency  and determination, although favorable  results are not always the outcome.  However, this season, as in some seasons past,  the Titans  emerged victorious  alongside  their  passionate  coach George Horton, who sees every  opportunity as one in which positive  results may rise.  The Titans continued their inspiring  display of teamwork and will to win  throughout the College World Series.  They defeated the University of Miami  Hurricanes and then the University of  South  Carolina Gamecocks  in  the  semifinals. This run of the Titans culminated with their sweep of the best-  of-three championship series by defeating the top-ranked University of Texas  Longhorns 6–4 and 3–2 in come-from-behind victories.  The Cal State-Fullerton Titans finished with an overall record of 47 wins  and 22 losses and a postseason record of  11 wins and 2 losses. This victory for  Cal State-Fullerton head coach George  Horton was bittersweet as he defeated  his longtime mentor and friend Augie  Garrido who led the Titans in the past  for 21 seasons during which he won  three national championships before  leaving  to  coach  the University of  Texas Longhorns back in 1996.  The atmosphere at both the stadium  in Omaha, Nebraska, and back home in  Orange County was electrifying. Fans  across Orange County displayed their  Titan pride in waves by wearing Cal  State-Fullerton  colors  identified  by  the distinguishable orange and blue.  The Titans were welcomed home by  an enthusiastic crowd of  supporters  upon their arrival in Orange County  where a parade took place in honor of  these exceptional college athletes.  Throughout the season, the Titans  were led by a gutsy group of players  such as All-Americans Kurt Suzuki,  who hit a single with two outs in the  bottom of the seventh inning driving  home  the game-winning  run  in  the  final game of the series, and Jason  Windsor, who pitched his second complete game of the College World Series,  earning him Most Outstanding Player  honors as they captured the NCAA Division I baseball championship.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Cal  State-Fullerton Titans’ players, coaches, staff and  fans who were  instrumental in bringing the College World  Series championship back to Fullerton  for a fourth time.

Res. 704, recognizing the NCAA men’s baseball championship  earned  by  the  California  State-Fullerton  Titans.  The  Titans  started 15–16, highly unusual, but they  capped a memorable run to the 2004 national championship with a 3–2 win  over Texas. Cal State-Fullerton’s All-  American catcher, Kurt Suzuki, hit an  RBI single in the bottom of the seventh  inning to put the Titans ahead to stay.  Despite the loss, Texas coach Augie  Garrido, the Texas players and their  fans should be proud of a well-played  VerDate May 21 2004  00:53 Jul 13, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12JY7.007 H12PT1 ",2004
1364,11,2004-07-12,Mrs. BONO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor a man who holds a distinguished record  of life-long public service to the United States.  President Gerald R. Ford, the 38th President  of the United States, celebrates his 91st birthday  today. Since 1913, President Ford has  been a diligent, humble steward of public service to our great country. He is a role model for  all of us involved with public office, and I am  fortunate  to also call him a dear  friend and  constituent. It is with great pleasure that I congratulate President Ford, and extend best  wishes to his family on this day of celebration.  President Ford’s public service began  in  high school, where he achieved the honor of  Eagle Scout. He later earned ten battle stars  as lieutenant commander in the Navy, served  the State of Michigan  in Congress  for 12  terms, eventually served as House Minority  Leader  in 1965, and  finally, he served our  country as the 38th President. As President,  he  lead America  through  the weakest economy of  the post-World War  II period, confronting tough issues as rising levels of both  inflation and unemployment.  After completing his term as President, he  returned to Rancho Mirage—a region of southern California that I have the privilege of representing. Now, even at the age of 91, he continues to invest time, energy, and experience  into improving our community. His investments  in the Rancho Mirage region helped to spark  unprecedented levels of economic growth that  began in 1983 and continue today. His commitments  include support  for  the McCallum  Theatre in Palm Desert, the Living Desert and  Desert Museum, and the Eisenhower Medical  Center and the Betty Ford Center.  In 1997, Ford joined Gen. Colin Powell in  Philadelphia  for  the  formation of America’s  Promise. In my district, he brought the goals  of helping young people to fruition by chairing  an  America’s  Promise  chapter  in  the  Coachella Valley.  President Bill Clinton presented Ford with  the Medal of Freedom in 1999, recognizing his  role in guiding the nation through the turbulent  times of Watergate, the Nixon resignation and  the end of the Vietnam war. Also in 1999, he  received  the Congressional Medal of Honor  for, ‘‘dedicated public service and outstanding  humanitarian contributions.’’  In my district, President Ford is heralded as  a man who consistently puts country over political party. He  is a respected and honored  leader, who tirelessly and passionately fights  for principles of  freedom, hope, and  justice.  On a personal note, President Ford has provided me with advice and inspiration to better  serve the people of the 45th District of California.  Ford and his wife, Betty, continue to support  numerous  local and national  charities and  service projects. Despite Ford’s  long  list of  honors, his humble spirit remains as a shining  example to us all. When asked about his and  Betty’s unrelenting investment of public service, he simply responded: ‘‘We’re trying to do  our  full share.’’ After decades of compassionate leadership, President Ford remains a  trusted, proven leader, who views giving back  to the community as a civic responsibility of all  Americans, not  just  the  task of elected officials.  On behalf of my constituents, the people of  California, and  the people of America,  I am  pleased to honor a man who has dedicated a  lifetime to public service on this very special  day. Happy 91st Birthday, President Gerald  Ford. You are a continuous  inspiration, admired leader, and valued friend.  ",2004

1385,53,2004-07-12,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Madam Speaker,  this evening I rise with several of my  colleagues  and  a number  from my  North  Carolina  delegation  to  talk  about our favorite son, JOHNEDWARDS,  as well as our ticket.  JOHNEDWARDS is from a little place  in Moore County called Robbins, North  Carolina. He currently resides in our  State capital of Raleigh.  I normally do not respond to things  some people say on the floor, and I find  it a bit of interest earlier that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  knew so much about him, they wanted  to quote from the Wall Street Journal.  There are a few people in North Carolina who read the Wall Street Journal,  but if he really wants to know about  JOHNEDWARDS, I would suggest he read  the Raleigh News and Observer, probably the Charlotte Observer or a lot of  our weekly papers, and he would find a  lot out about JOHNEDWARDS.  If he had been in Raleigh on Saturday, he would have had the opportunity to see about 20,000 people standing in the hot July sun, over 90 degrees  for 4 hours, to welcome home JOHNEDWARDSand Presidential nominee JOHN  KERRY and their wives Elizabeth and  Teresa to Raleigh, North Carolina. It  was a wonderful celebration of the first  North Carolinian on the Presidential  ticket in modern times.  I will have more to say about this in  just a moment, but first I want to yield  to my colleague, the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. MILLER), for some  comments.  Mr. MILLER  of North  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to  be here tonight. I did not think I would  be pleased to be here. In my office earlier, I was regretting greatly having  agreed last week to come down tonight  as I saw the time slip away and as I  was, instead of dinner, eating the complimentary North  Carolina  peanuts  that we pass out to our visitors, wondering when, if ever, tonight I would  get dinner.  Then I heard the speeches of a few  minutes ago by the gentleman  from  Georgia (Mr. KINGSTON) and by others  on the same topic but from a different  perspective, and I felt a new energy and  a new enthusiasm for our task tonight,  and I would like to address some of the  questions  that  the  gentleman  from  Georgia (Mr. KINGSTON) and the others  asked about JOHNEDWARDS.  First, the gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr. KINGSTON) asked why it was that  JOHNEDWARDSdid not have to answer  any of  the  insulting questions  that  were asked of Dan Quayle when the  first President Bush asked him to run  as Vice President in 1988, and I think  that there is a simple answer to that.  The gentleman  from Georgia  (Mr.  KINGSTON) said that Dan Quayle had  been in Congress for 12 years, JOHNEDWARDSin the Congress for only six, but  JOHNEDWARDShad not been asked why  he was qualified to be President when  that question was put very pointedly  to Mr. Quayle. The gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr. KINGSTON)  said he believed it must be because of the liberal  media. I think there is a different explanation.  JOHNEDWARDS is smart. JOHNEDWARDS is smart. Everyone knows he is  smart. Everyone who has spent any  time around him knows that. He  is  plenty smart enough to be Vice President. He is plenty smart enough to be  President.  Second, the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. KINGSTON) and all the others said  that this is a ticket of two crazy liberals, wild-eyed crazy liberals, out of  step with North Carolina or even, they  suggested, with Massachusetts, and I  just wish they would get their story  straight.  JOHNKERRYand JOHNEDWARDSare  the Huck Finns of American politics  because they got to attend their own  political funeral. In December of last  year and early January, they appeared  to be politically dead. Their campaigns  were not going anywhere. The former  governor of Vermont, Howard Dean,  appeared to be walking away with the  Democratic nomination. A  respected  political  reporter  here,  Stuart  Rothenberg, wrote a column that said,  ‘‘It ain’t over till it’s over, but it’s  over.’’ Howard Dean was assumed to be  the nominee.  So all the right-wing commentators  began talking about how the Democrats were going to nominate a crazy  liberal in Howard Dean; and, to establish that contrast, they said the Democrats were rejecting sensible, thoughtful, moderate  candidates  like JOHN  KERRYand JOHNEDWARDS. Things did  not go according to their script, and  now the ticket is JOHNKERRYand JOHN  EDWARDS, and those same thoughtful,  sensible, moderate folks that just a few  months ago they were praising, they  now are tarring with the same brush  that they tarred Howard Dean.  Also, they need to get their story  straight because just last week, in the  hours immediately after JOHNKERRY  had announced that he had asked JOHN  to run on the ticket with  him, the first response from the Bush-  Cheney campaign was a 26-page e-mail  that outlined all of these differences,  all these differences between KERRY  and EDWARDS, they just had nothing in  common, and it just showed how flagrantly political JOHNKERRYwas to  have asked  someone with whom he  EDWARDS VerDate May 21 2004  04:11 Jul 13, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12JY7.102 H12PT1 ",2004
1386,67,2004-07-12,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I have not  spoken to anyone, but it appears from  the body language I pick up and what I  believe I hear my friend from Pennsylvania  saying,  they do not  like  the  measure now before the body and they  want to change it.  That is the problem we have when we  report legislation directly to the floor  without the necessary hearings. As to  this matter that is now before the Senate, it is my understanding we have  not had hearings before the Judiciary  Committee where  they  should have  gone on. The Senate Chamber is not  the place to do what committees are  there to do.  If there  is some mistake or some  other amendment that the Senators  would  rather have on  the majority  side, I suggest they take this back to  the Judiciary Committee, have a full  hearing, and decide really what they do  want. It goes without saying it will not  wind up being very pleasant if, in fact,  we ever got to the resolution itself and  this  amendment were  open  to  the  amendment process. Everyone knows if  that happens, this amendment would  be bogged down with Christmas-tree-  like ornaments called amendments.  We  thought when we arrived and  worked  with  our Members—Friday  morning I personally called probably a  dozen telling them what our plan was,  not to have a procedural bottleneck to  this legislation—that we would move  immediately  to  that. That was not  really what some wanted to do. Some  wanted an up-or-down vote on the motion to proceed. We were able to show  them it was better for the system that  we move directly to the resolution.  We also thought we have so many  things to do. Just last week we had a  closed  evidentiary  presentation  on  what is going on around the world and  in our country with homeland security.  There are things we need to do in that  regard. Last week  the distinguished  Presiding Officer was here where my  friend, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, now stands trying to work  something out so that we could move  forward on  the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security bill.  That is something we should work on.  We have all the appropriations bills to  do. There is so much this body needs to  do and we were trying to open up as  much time in the remaining time we  have left in this short legislative session before the August break, before  the two national conventions, to provide more time on the Senate floor.  The leader told me last week one of  the things he was considering is going  to the Australian Free Trade Agreement. Some Members feel very strongly about that. I know the committee  has had hearings on this issue. I have  spoken to Senator HATCHon more than  one occasion.  My only point is that we should not  be amending  this  resolution on  the  Senate floor.  It is my feeling the best way to move  to this is to move immediately to the  resolution itself, do not have a motion  to proceed which,  if  cloture  is attempted on the motion to proceed, I do  not think we will ever get to the resolution, and that is not fair. People in  the State of Nevada feel strongly about  it, as in the State of Pennsylvania, the  State of Colorado, and the State of  Alaska, one way or the other.  We should have the opportunity to  vote up or down on this resolution, not  on some procedural issue. But it appears to me that is where we are headed. We are headed as we are doing on so  many other issues. Class action: I was  not a supporter of the class action legislation, but for the class action legislation there was a 5-foot jumpshot to  make that legislation succeed. I have  to say, the majority did not miss the  jumpshot; they did not even bother to  take the 5-foot jumpshot. They walked  away from that legislation.  I think the same thing has happened  on a number of other issues. It appears  to me what the majority wants is the  issue, not a resolution of the issue. And  now, if we are going to have to vote on  the motion to invoke cloture on the  motion to proceed, the majority can  walk out and  say: See what  those  Democrats did. They wouldn’t even let  us vote on the resolution.  I will tell everyone within the sound  of my voice, we will allow a vote on the  resolution. We want to go immediately  to the resolution that is now before the  Senate. I believe it is two sentences  long, so it should not take a lot of  thought as to what the resolution contains.  I would  say, with  the great  minds we  have  on  the Republican  side—and I do not say that in any way  to castigate anyone; I believe we have  people with great  legislative experience in the majority, and this issue has  been around for a long time—why in  the world would they bring something  before the Senate they do not want?  So I hope we can avoid procedural  pitfalls and move directly at a time  convenient.  I also say this: Senator KERRY and  Senator EDWARDSwould like to vote on  the resolution. But if we cannot set a  time certain, set a time uncertain, and  they may or may not make it. We do  want a time certain within a respectable period of time, but I hope this is  not being done, so they are being prevented from voting on it. As you know,  we had an important issue here a couple weeks ago where we set a time certain, we thought we had a time certain,  and,  as  a  result  of  our misunderstanding, Senator KERRY wasted  a  whole day here and was not able to  vote.  So for whatever reason the majority  appears not to want us to vote on the  resolution itself, I hope that can be resolved. We want to get along. We want  to allow as much time as possible on  other issues, so there can be adequate  debate on other legislation other than  this matter.  What is going to happen if we proceed  down this road, I would assume, is if  the majority leader decides to file a  cloture motion on the motion to proceed  tonight, we will  vote  on  it  Wednesday, and that will be the end of  this debate. That would be too bad, because I think people should vote on the  resolution itself and not be able to hide  under some procedural vote.  Maybe there are those on the other  side who would rather not vote on the  amendment itself. I think if we had a  good, straight, up-or-down vote on the  resolution, I would be surprised if we  did not get 8 to 12 Republican Senators  voting against the resolution now before this body. That may be another  part of what the leadership is doing in  this instance, saying simply: We are  not going to allow the embarrassment  to take place where this resolution  gets 40 or 42 votes, when 67 are needed.  There are many who have said—and  we have heard speeches on the floor—  why are we doing this? Why are we voting on something that is doomed to  failure? It will not pass. The constitutional amendment will not pass the  Senate. In fact, as I said, if we had an  up-or-down vote, maybe 42 votes would  be in favor of it. That is 25 short of  enough  to meet  the  constitutional  muster.  So for whatever reason, for whatever  plan the majority has, we want a vote  on the resolution. However, if the majority decides to bring this resolution  to the floor, and it is amendable, I do  not think the motion to proceed will  prevail. I cannot speak for every Senator over here, but I can speak for a  few of them.  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The  Senator from Pennsylvania.  ",2004
1387,67,2004-07-12,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Democratic whip to agree to having substantive votes because I think it is important to have a substantive vote. As  someone who  is a cosponsor of the  amendment, I will assure you, I have  no desire to have anything but an up-  or-down vote on the amendments that  have been talked about over here on  this side of the aisle.  The point I would simply want to  make to the Senator from Nevada is,  No. 1, this issue has had many hearings. There have been seven hearings in  congressional committees, four in the  Judiciary Committee,  ranging  from  one that was on September 4 of last  year, one on March 3 of this year, one  on March 23 of this year, and one on  May 13. The first three were in the Judiciary Committee. The Subcommittee  on Science, Technology and Space had  one on May 13.

1388,81,2004-07-12,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, the Senator  from Alabama  is  also  an  extraordinarily fine lawyer in his own right.  Of course, the answer is yes. Once the  Supreme Court has spoken, and there  is language in this Lawrence case that  suggests to many that the Court would  be inclined to rule in that fashion, then  the Court has just enunciated the supreme law of the land and no State  constitutional provision or Federal law  in any way could attempt to override  that. That would be the  law of the  land.  ",2004
1389,81,2004-07-12,Mr. SESSIONS.," If California passed  it with 90 percent of the vote, or 60 percent, as I believe they did pass a statute by ballot  initiative, no matter  what the people voted,  it would be  trumped and wiped out by the ruling.  ",2004
1390,81,2004-07-12,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, the Senator  from Alabama is correct. The Federal  Constitution  trumps State  constitutions. Even if the people of a State  amend their own State constitution,  were  the Supreme Court  to declare  that same-sex marriages are required  by the equal protection or the due  process clause of the U.S. Constitution,  that would be the supreme law of the  land, overriding any other Federal law,  State law, or State constitution.  ",2004
1391,81,2004-07-12,Mr. SESSIONS.," I thank the Senator  from Arizona.  Mr. President, I would like to share a  few thoughts this afternoon. I thank  him for his insight into the complexity  and the confusion that will result if we  don’t have a national standard as we  have always had on marriage.  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courage and compassion  and understanding of the importance of  family.  I thank the President  for his eloquent remarks last Friday on this important matter.  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, for his  brilliance and  for the comprehensive  statements he made today and Friday  concerning the need for and the custom  and the  legality of a constitutional  amendment on this question.  People say, Why do we need to do it  now?  I was in a hearing and one of the individuals said, Well, the State of Massachusetts may pass a constitutional  amendment, and that would sort of, he  indicated, solve the problem. I asked  him, if it is all right for the people of  Massachusetts or Michigan or Alabama  or Utah  to  pass  a  constitutional  amendment  that  defines marriage,  what is wrong with the people of the  United States and the Federal system  passing a constitutional amendment to  deal with marriage?  All of the people who seem to be  questioning and suggesting we should  not  go  forward with  this kind  of  amendment are doing so on the basis  that State  constitutions  are  being  amended. But as we heard from Senator KYL, a State constitution will not  solve the matter if the Supreme Court  acts as they have indicated they will. I  believe it is perfectly appropriate for  the people of the United States to consider whether  they would want  to  amend our Constitution.  Some say that marriage is just not  important, that this is not a matter we  ought to spend any time on, and why  now. They say, you are just bringing  this up because there is an election ongoing. Let me say that it was just last  year that the Supreme Court ruled in  Lawrence. It was less than a year ago  when Massachusetts ruled in their case  that made so much of an impact, and  the result of the Massachusetts case  was just brought into effect May 17 of  this year.  What started this debate was not  people who believe  in  family as we  have always known  it. They didn’t  start this debate. They didn’t start the  discussion, the debate and legal activism, that attempts to change a fundamental American  institution. It was  the courts that did so activist lawyers  and activist judges.  It would  indeed be unthinkable to  most people that we would ever need to  discuss a constitutional amendment to  defend marriage. Unfortunately, the integrity of the  legal system  is being  eroded as political agendas are being  implemented more and more through  rulings of the courts. That, let me say,  fundamentally goes to the heart of the  American democracy.  Democracy  in  this  country  rests  power with the people. But lifetime-appointed judges usurp this power—and it  does not even take all nine on the Supreme Court, or all seven on the Massachusetts Supreme Court. In fact, it was  four out of the seven judges on the  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court,  unaccountable  to  the  public,  who  issued an opinion and cannot be held to  account.  If we vote on issues the American  people do not affirm, do not approve of  and object to, we can be removed from  office. That  is the way the system  works.  We must not allow this power to go  to the courts. In fact, that is precisely  the issue that has driven the debate  ever since President Bush has been in  office, even going back to President  Reagan: What do you want out of  judges on the courts of America? Do we  want judges who impose agendas to do  what they think is right under the circumstances? Or do you want  judges  who follow the law—Judges who care  about the law and are respectful of it  and indeed respectful of the people of  the United States of America who,  through their elected representatives,  they believe should be setting social  policy in this country.  That is the challenge we are facing.  That is the second important part of  this debate. The first is marriage is an  institution of tremendous importance  and the rulings we have seen in courts  today will undoubtedly erode the validity, impact, and power of that institution that has helped raise healthy generations of Americans year after year.  That is one aspect.  The other aspect  is  the power of  unelected judges. That power is frightening. We have seen a number of opinions from the Supreme Court of the  United States that cause concern. We  saw the Supreme Court avoid ruling recently on the Pledge of Allegiance case  that challenged the ‘‘under God’’ language in the Pledge. They could have  ruled on that and nailed that  issue  down. I suspect it suggests the Court is  undecided about that. Certainly a number of their opinions have given a basis  for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  to  strike down  the Pledge of Allegiance.  The Supreme Court of the United  States, in my view, is seriously drifting  from its principles. We have had members of that court, more than one, start  talking about European  law as they  analyze legal matters. They have forgotten the American Constitution is a  contract between the American people  and their Government. It empowers our  Government to carry on certain powers  and not to do others and retain to the  democratic process other actions.  This amendment will have a twofold  impact. No. 1, it will protect the integrity of marriage, a critical institution  to our culture; No. 2, it will indicate to  our courts that the American people  are not  incapable of defending their  liberties when they are under attack  by courts. They seem to think this  issue will be stirred up for a number of  months and then it will settle down  and people will go away; that is the  way it is going to be, do not worry  about it. There will be editorials and  church people will carry a sign and  someone will sign a petition, but we  have lifetime appointments and we are  like philosopher kings. We can see the  long term and what is good for America. We have decided this is the right  thing for America to do. We will take  the heat for a few months or a year or  two and it will go away, we will be affirmed, and we will affirm our view and  stand by it and that will be the end of  that. These small-minded citizens will  go away.

1394,88,2004-07-12,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  rise to speak on this proposed amendment,  constitutional  amendment  to  protect marriage. I am an original cosponsor. I support the Allard amendment. He has done an absolutely fabulous job of bringing this forward. I will  articulate those reasons  for my colleagues and for others.  This is a critical battle. We are at a  critical stage  in the culture of the  United States. What happens on this  particular issue will have a profound  impact on the  future of the United  States of America. It is that which we  are actually debating today.  I have no doubt it is imperative we  act now by means of a constitutional  amendment  to protect marriage. As  some of my distinguished colleagues  have already pointed out, this action  has been made necessary not by election year politics but by the reckless  actions of a judiciary bent on radical  social experimentation.  Let there be no mistake, the stakes  in this battle of the future of our culture are enormous. This attempt by  the judiciary to radically redefine marriage is both a grave threat to our central social institution and a serious affront to the democratic rule in our Nation.  On our reaction to this threat hinges  the future of marriage and our future  as a self-governing people. Both are at  stake. Most Americans believe homosexuals have a right to live as they  choose. They do not believe a small  group of activists or a tiny  judicial  elite have a right to redefine marriage  and impose a radical social experiment  on our entire society.  Let us be clear, this is not a battle  over civil rights; it is a battle over  whether marriage will be emptied of its  meaning in contradiction to the will of  the people and their duly elected representatives. We are a democracy, not  a people ruled by a judicial dictator. In  order to reach a predetermined outcome with regard to marriage, judges  such as the five judges responsible for  the Goodridge decision  in Massachusetts  are  disregarding  thousands  of  years of custom and experience, the  laws of every society, and the beliefs of  every major religious tradition. Unless  action is taken by Congress to protect  marriage by means of a constitutional  amendment, the marriage laws of 50  States will be at the mercy of Federal  judges, and marriage itself will be redefined out of all recognition.  The Defense of Marriage Act passed  by Congress  in  1996  is not enough.  Without a constitutional amendment,  Federal judges will likely rule DOMA,  the Defense of Marriage Act, unconstitutional under the doctrine of full faith  and credit, and marriages recognized in  one State will be required to be recognized in all.  As several of my distinguished colleagues  have  noted,  challenges  to  DOMA are already making their way  through the courts. This radical attempt to redefine marriage also highlights the need to rein in an increasingly reckless judiciary. When activist  judges show no regard for legal intent  or precedent, using their positions to  achieve policy goals, they must be resolutely opposed. In fundamentally altering the definition of marriage and  changing duly approved marriage laws,  these  judges show contempt  for the  democratic process itself.  The choice is clear: Either we amend  the Constitution and protect the rights  of the people to self-determination in  this process or the Constitution will be  amended,  in effect, by the edict of  judges.  The time has come to act. If we continue to let activist judges determine  the fate of marriage, the battle may be  lost and we could lose the institution  of marriage. Marriage can be lost.  It is important to take a step back  from the heat of this controversy in  order to understand why defending the  institution of marriage is so important  to the Nation’s future. America’s political system is framed around a particular understanding of human freedom, an understanding of freedom not  as mere license but as something that  must be guided and governed by a fundamental internal moral code. In keeping with human nature, the direction is  toward both the individual good and  the common good.  Our great experiment and freedom as  a nation has not been without its difficult moments of trial when we have  struggled with our very identity as a  people as we attempted to resolve the  tensions inherent in the responsible exercise of  freedom. The attempts  to  grapple with the evils of slavery in the  19th century and civil rights struggles  of the 20th century are primary examples.  In the long view of history, it seems  likely we will look back at the social  changes identified with the decline of  marriage and the family, which began  to make cultural inroads in the 1960s,  and conclude that this vast cultural experiment has been a very harmful one,  particularly harmful on children. That  experiment, of course, continues today,  but there are indications America is  beginning to reevaluate that experiment, to assess where it is heading, and  whether, as a people, we need to correct course.  A vitally important part of this assessment is to study the social science  data regarding what happens when sexuality and children are taken outside  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:08 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S12JY4.REC S12JY4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

1397,95,2004-07-12,Mr. NICKLES.," Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report prepared by the  Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,  as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of  Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget  for 1986.  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2004 budget  through June  25,  2004—the  last day  that the Senate was in session before  the  recent  recess. The estimates of  budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical  and economic assumptions of the 2004  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget,  H. Con. Res. 95, as adjusted.  The  estimates  show  that  current  level spending is above the budget resolution by $8.6 billion in budget authority and by $28 million in outlays in  2004. Current level for revenues is $3.1  billion above the budget resolution in  2004.  Since my last report dated April 20,  2004, the Congress has cleared and the  President has signed the following acts  which changed budget authority, outlays, or revenues for 2004: the Surface  Transportation Extension Act of 2004,  Part II—P.L. 108–224; the TANF and Related Programs Continuation Act of  2004—P.L. 108–262; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004, Part  III—P.L. 108–263; the Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004—  P.L. 108–265; and, an act approving the  renewal of  import  restrictions  contained  in the Burmese Freedom and  Democracy Act of 2003—P.L. 108–272. In  addition, the Congress has cleared for  the President’s signature H.R. 4103, the  African Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act of 2004.  I ask unanimous consent that the  budget scorekeeping report be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. CONGRESS,  CONGRESSIONALBUDGETOFFICE,  Washington, DC, July 12, 2004.  Hon.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the  technical and economic assumptions of H.  Con.

1398,95,2004-07-12,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, today I  want to take a few minutes to remember Ronald R. Mazik and pay tribute to  the many contributions he has made to  his community, to his profession, and  to this country.  Ron played many roles and achieved  much in his lifetime. As an athlete, engineer and businessman, he excelled in  a wide array of endeavors. Of his many  achievements, one is particularly deserving of mention: as a pioneer in the  field of telehealth.

1399,102,2004-07-12,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. President, today  I have introduced the Veterans Benefits Outreach Act.  Caring for our veterans is a commitment  that  supersedes  politics. The  President and Congress are united in  our promise to provide veterans with  access to quality care and benefits.  Spending for veterans medical care  has  doubled  since  1993.  President  Bush’s budget for the VA increased by  9 percent in fiscal year 2002, 13 percent  in 2003 and another 4 percent in 2004.  We in the Senate passed a budget resolution calling for another 5 percent increase next year. We have begun giving  veterans concurrent  receipt of  their  disability and retirement benefits, and  are working to fix the survivor benefit  plan.  But what good are these benefits if  people don’t know they can apply for  them? According to an article that ran  on the front page of the St. Paul Pioneer Press today entitled:  ‘‘Wounded  and Forgotten,’’ there are an estimated  half a million veterans who are eligible  for Federal disability payments but are  not  receiving  them—simply  because  they don’t know that they can.  We need to do a better job of educating veterans about their rights. To  this end, my legislation calls for the  Veterans Administration to develop a  strategy each year to reach out to veterans who are not taking advantage of  the programs they’re eligible  for—to  give them a chance to make an informed  decision  about  the  benefits  America has promised them.  In addition to veterans who are not  getting their benefits because they are  unaware of them, there are some veterans who know they are eligible but  have been turned away because of lost  documents. You see, in 1973, the National Personnel Records Center  in  Missouri  caught on  fire, destroying  thousands  of  veterans’  personnel  records.  The law already calls for the VA to  give veterans the benefit of the doubt  when they are missing documents that  had been destroyed in the fire. But it is  clear that in practice this is simply not  the case. Too many veterans get nothing more than a postcard telling them  their case cannot be proven because of  the destruction of their records three  decades ago.  It  is  simply  unconscionable  that  these veterans should have to suffer because their records were ruined while  in the custody of the government. To  deal with this problem, my legislation  also directs the VA to set up an appeals  process  for those whose applications  are rejected because of documents lost  in that fire.  My  legislation  is about going the  extra mile to do the right thing. These  are not hand-outs, these are not new  entitlement programs—these are benefits prescribed under the law for people  who have already qualified for them by  serving  their  country. We must do  whatever  it takes to give America’s  veterans  the  benefits we  promised  them.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S. 2638  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans  Benefits Outreach Act of 2004’’.  SEC. 2. ANNUAL PLAN ON OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.

1400,109,2004-07-12,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Valley Center Municipal Water District, which meets the  water and wastewater needs of Valley Center  and its 23,000 residents.  Fifty years ago, on July 12, 1954, a group  of citizens formed an agency to build a water  storage and  transport system  to access  the  water  resources of  the San Diego County  Water Authority and  the Metropolitan Water  District of Southern California. At the time, securing these sources was imperative for continued community growth in a region that had  only limited rainfall.  Today, in addition to providing water supply  and sanitation services to their customers, the  Valley Center Municipal Water District has  promoted water conservation  through  incentives such as vouchers for ultra low flush toilets and high efficiency washing machines,  residential  landscape  assistance,  and  providing water conservation guidelines for their  customers.  Mr. Speaker,  the Valley Center Municipal  Water District has provided an invaluable service to the community it serves. This agency  continues to fulfill its mission of ensuring customer satisfaction  through quality service at  the lowest possible price. I would like to thank  the water district and its current and past employees  for  their hard work  in meeting  the  water needs of the residents and businesses  it serves. Their efforts have allowed a community to flourish in one of Southern California’s  most scenic and unique locations.  f  HONORING CADET JUSTIN B. COPE  HON.

1401,109,2004-07-12,Mr. FROST.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor Cadet Justin B. Cope for his recent appointment as a Chief Petty Officer of  the  United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps. The  United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps was  first established in 1958 in order to develop a  greater  appreciation  of  the United States’  naval history, traditions, customs, and significant role in defense. With only about one half  of one percent of Naval Sea Cadets receiving  the recognition and honor of being appointed  as a Chief Petty Officer, Cadet Cope’s ascension to the rank of Chief Petty Officer clearly  reflects his superior qualities in leadership, expertise in seamanship, and patriotic character.  Again,  I congratulate Chief Petty Officer  Justin B. Cope’s great achievement and wish  him all the greatest success in the future.  f  MOURNING THE DEATH OF C.  MICHAEL SAVAGE  HON. JESSE L.

1402,109,2004-07-12,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my privilege to pay tribute to the life of Clarence Michael Savage, a model of compassion,  commitment,  and  community  service, who  passed away on June 24. Mike was a man of  strong personal faith, and a devout advocate  of social justice.  A graduate of St. Louis University, Mike  began his career of service working on behalf  of  lower-income neighborhoods  in St. Louis  and migrant  farm workers  throughout  the  country. Mike was known as a champion for  the rights of people marginalized in our society. He served as  the CEO of  the Access  Community Health Network  in Chicago  from  1994 until his  tragic death  last month. Mike  was innovative in his approach to serving the  working poor, uninsured and medically underserved. During his tenure at Access, Mike led  the  organization  through  unprecedented  change as the organization grew from nine to  forty-one health centers serving more  than  160,000 patients annually.  Throughout his career, Mike was unyielding  in his pursuit of justice. Before joining Access,  Mike served as Executive Director of Fenway  Community Health Center in Boston. He also  worked for Heartland Alliance Travelers & Immigrants Aid and United Neighborhood Organization of Near Southwest Chicago. Mike was  also active  in many organizations nationally  and  locally,  including National Healthy Start  Association, United Power for Action and Justice, and the Chicago Chapter of Dignity USA.  Those of us who were privileged  to have  known him, will remember his incredible passion for addressing the underserved and his  commitment to those in the fight with him. He  was a visionary, he was a leader, and he was  a friend. I extend my deepest condolences to  Andy Swan, his partner, his  family, and all  those who  join me  in  treasuring Mike’s  memory.

1404,5,2004-07-16,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, in a few  minutes we will be closing out for the  weekend. I will briefly comment on a  couple of current issues before addressing some of the business before the  Senate.  The first issue is a brief comment on  President Bush’s decision or his administration’s decision yesterday to have  the Federal Medicare Program recognize obesity as a disease. Earlier today, we were talking about  public health issues, and I mentioned  in some African countries, because of  an HIV/AIDS virus, the total length of  life will be 33 years of age. In Botswana, if you were born in 1970, you  would live 17 years longer than if you  are born today because of that little  virus. I mentioned that. That has gotten worse over the last 30 years, which  we probably did not know anything  about in this country until about 20  years ago. And  it  is getting much  worse.  Another problem, very  similar  to  that, is one that is apparent to anybody who has kids today and picks  them up from school. If you just watch,  you see the kids are much heavier than  20 years ago, 30 years ago. And that has  lifelong consequences. It comes down  to obesity.

The unanimous consent request would have gone on to say 5  hours of debate, to be equally divided,  to be followed by a vote on the confirmation at 2:15 on Tuesday, July 20,  with no intervening action or debate.

1410,138,2004-07-16,Mr. BURR.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this misguided amendment that threatens not only the delicate balance achieved in  passage of  the  international  tax bill, H.R.  4520, but also the future of every farm program administered by USDA.  Tobacco simply happens  to be  first. More  crops will most certainly  follow. To my colleagues who produce feed grains, wheat, rice,  cotton,  tobacco, dairy,  soybeans, oilseeds,  peanuts, sugar, honey, wool, and certain other  crops: Your crops are next.  It  is also somewhat disingenuous  for proponents of this amendment to claim that they  are protecting  the American  taxpayer.  If  indeed ‘‘taxpayers’’ are impacted by the tobacco  reform provisions included in H.R. 4520, the  burden  falls only on  those who pay excise  taxes on  tobacco products. Any approach  other than the one proposed in H.R. 4520 will  actually result in a tax increase on those who  choose to use tobacco products. If that is what  colleagues really are seeking, they should say  so.  The facts, Mr. Chairman, are that tobacco  and tobacco taxes raise more than $30 billion  every year for states and the Federal government. We are only asking for a portion of this  money over five years to provide relief to our  struggling farmers and their communities.  f  DEPLORING MISUSE  OF  INTERNATIONAL  COURT  OF  JUSTICE  BY UNITED NATIONS GENERAL  ASSEMBLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE  SPEECHOF  HON. DAVID E. PRICE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 14, 2004  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to express my  serious  reservations  about House Resolution 713.  Israel’s construction of a security barrier has  been a source of great controversy within  Israel and in the international community.  The debate has less to do with the actual  construction of a barrier than with the route of  the barrier.  The government of Israel regards the barrier  as a form of self-defense—a legitimate means  for preventing further terrorist infiltration. Israel  has a right to self-defense, and if the Israeli  government believes that the security barrier  is the best means for protecting their citizens,  then I support their right to construct a barrier.  But as it now stands, the barrier has gone  deeply into territory beyond the 1967 borders.  That is the fact the authors of this resolution  choose  to  ignore: There would be no  International Court of Justice decision to condemn  if  Israel were building  the  fence along  the  Green Line.  The Supreme Court of  Israel  recently ordered portions of  the  fence  rerouted. The  Court held that the barrier’s current route ‘‘injures  the  local  inhabitants  in a severe and  acute way while violating their rights under humanitarian and international law.’’  American diplomats also have worked diligently  to modify  the barrier’s  route  in  their  dealings with the Israeli government.  This resolution threatens to damage these  efforts, implying an unqualified endorsement of  the barrier and warning the international community against efforts  to  influence  the situation.  Roughly one-quarter of the 420-mile barrier  has  been  completed—clearly  there  is  still  much at stake  for both  the  Israelis and  the  Palestinians. Our efforts should be directed at  negotiating borders  that will advance peace.  Resolutions such as the one before us today  do nothing to advance the peace process.  There are legitimate questions as to the propriety and wisdom of the action taken by the  International Court of Justice  in  this matter.  But this resolution goes too far. It condemns  the  ICJ and  ‘‘Palestinian Leadership’’  indiscriminately, and  it undermines worthy efforts  underway in Israel, the U.S., and internationally to promote Israel’s security in ways that  enhance the prospects for a just and lasting  peace in the region.  If we were  truly serious about promoting  peace in the Middle East, we would focus on  efforts like the Roadmap rather than pass resolutions such as H. Res. 713.  f  INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RENAME  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  VETERANS  AFFAIRS  MEDICAL  CENTER  IN AMARILLO, TEXAS,  THE  ‘‘THOMAS  E.  CREEK  DEPARTMENT  OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER’’  HON. MAC THORNBERRY  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 15, 2004  ",2004
1411,138,2004-07-16,Mr. THORNBERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I  have the privilege, along with the entire Texas  delegation in the House and Mr. Moran from  Kansas, to introduce a bill to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in  Amarillo, Texas,  the  ‘‘Thomas E. Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.’’  Lance Corporal Thomas E. Creek, USMC,  of Amarillo, Texas, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously by President Nixon. He was a true American hero, deserving of this recognition and honor.  On February  13,  1969,  Lance Corporal  Creek was an 18 year old Marine with Company I, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine  Division in Vietnam. He was part of a resupply  convoy that was ambushed by enemy forces  using mortars, mines, fragmentation grenades,  and small arms. According to the documents  recommending him  for  the Medal of Honor,  ‘‘[t]he  fierce combat  found  the men  firing at  point blank range.’’ Lance Corporal Creek was  wounded by a bullet in the neck, but then saw  a  fragmentation grenade  land between him  and  the rest of  the squad. He  then,  though  wounded, deliberately rolled on top of the grenade, taking the full impact of the explosion,  and saving the lives of 5 Marines nearby. His  act inspired the rest of the squad to defeat the  enemy and complete its mission to resupply  the forward combat base.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot help but be moved  by such acts of self-sacrifice and bravery.  They exemplify the highest standards of the  Marine Corps, our military, and our Nation.  The veterans community in the Amarillo area  suggested  this way  of  honoring Corporal  Creek. It is supported by the American Legion,  Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars,  Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS.  I also want to acknowledge and to thank all  those who have helped in this effort to recognize Lance Corporal Creek, especially Corporal Creek’s family, Selden Hale, and Larry  Milam, who were instrumental in this endeavor.  In some ways, 1969 seems like a long time  ago, yet acts of bravery like Corporal Creek’s  are timeless. They provide an example for us  all. Corporal Creek’s name will further magnify  the honor attached to those who have served  our nation and receive health care at this veterans’ facility. I urge my colleagues to support  the measure.  f  WELCOMING THE OPENING OF THE  ROBERT BROADBENT LAS VEGAS  MONORAIL  HON. JON C.

1412,138,2004-07-16,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  welcome the opening of the Robert Broadbent  Las Vegas Monorail today in Las Vegas, Nevada. This momentous achievement will expand  transit opportunities  for  residents and  visitors in Southern Nevada while enhancing  the environment, reducing congestion, and improving safety.  The Robert Broadbent Monorail is the most  technically advanced  transit  system  in  the  world. The first leg will run 4 miles along the  world famous Las Vegas Strip. The Broadbent  Monorail is built entirely with private money,  and shows the commitment to build for our future that southern Nevada is famous for. The  monorail is named after Robert Broadbent, a  long-time community leader who sadly passed  away  last year. Robert Broadbent was  the  chairman of the Monorail and served as Mayor  of  Boulder  City,  County  Commissioner,  McCarran Airport Director and Director of the  Bureau of Reclamation.  I invite all the members of the House to visit  Las Vegas and see  firsthand  the Broadbent  Monorail. I urge the House to join me in congratulating Chairman Jim Gibson, President  Cam Walker, and all of the men and women  who have contributed over  the years  to  the  success of this project. I look forward to extending  the monorail  in  the near  future  to  serve McCarran Airport, downtown Las Vegas,  and other points in southern Nevada.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JACK VALENTI  HON.

Serving  the people of  the Monroe County  region for 179 years, this newspaper has advanced its values of integrity, community, and  growth while remaining one of  the  few employee-owned newspapers in the country. The  Evening News has been recognized for more  than its longevity, winning several prestigious  awards including the Annual Award for Communications Excellence in 1996.  The Monroe Evening News has been published  from  its current  location since 1910.  Demonstrating an ongoing need to best serve  their  readers,  this  renovation,  costing  $3,000,000, will be the third renovation to this  building. The renovation has reconfigured the  entire interior of the building; creating an enhanced main entrance and expanding the customer-service area. While the interior has an  updated, contemporary look, the exterior and  additions will maintain the historic appearance  of the long-standing building.  As The Monroe Evening News opens  its  newly overhauled offices, I would ask that my  colleagues rise and join with me in congratulating a thriving, employee-owned daily newspaper on a successful, fruitful renovation. As  The Evening News approaches one hundred  years in the same building, let us wish them  the best of  luck  for  the next hundred years  and beyond.  I ask for unanimous consent to include in  the RECORD these  remarks  from celebrated  political columnist Jack Germond, who started  his legendary career at The Monroe Evening  News:  I am privileged to join John Dingell in congratulating The Evening News, a newspaper  that taught me many of the most valuable  lessons of journalism when I worked there as  a young reporter from 1951 through 1953. The  newspaper had standards that were a model,  and the publisher, JS Gray, was impervious  to pressure. When you wrote a story that was  accurate and fair it went into the paper no  matter who complained how loudly. There  were no sacred cows, not always the case everywhere. Looking back on more than 50  years in the business, I cherish the memories  of my time in Monroe.  IN MEMORY OF VICTOR G. REUTHER, JANUARY  1,  1912–JUNE  3,  2004  HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 15, 2004  ",2004
1415,145,2004-07-16,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, Victor G. Reuther was born January 1, 1912, in Wheeling,  West Virginia, where his father, Valentine, was  well known as President of  the Ohio Valley  Trades and Labor Assembly and as an active  churchman. Victor was educated in the secondary schools of that state, and along with  his brothers, by their father as well. The strong  religious influence of Victor’s early family life is  revealed throughout his life in his continuing  interest and activity in relating core ethical values to the broad field of social and economic  life. Victor studied economics and sociology at  the West Virginia University and at Wayne  State University. Years later he was awarded  the degree of Honorary Doctor of Laws by  both of those universities.  In 1932 Victor  joined his brothers Walter  and Roy in Detroit for work in the auto industry. Between 1932 and 1935, Victor and his  brother Walter, both unemployed, used  their  meager savings to travel and work their way  around  the world. They  traveled by bicycle  through Europe and Asia,  lodging with  farm  families and at hostels, and visited relatives in  Germany. They witnessed the beginning of the  Nazi government in Germany and the growth  of Stalin’s despotism in Soviet Russia, where  they worked at the Gorky auto factory. Those  observations  and  firsthand  experience  led  them to become strong, pro-democratic leaders for freedom and social justice. On return to  the United States, Victor went to work on the  assembly  line of  the Kelsey-Hayes Wheel  Company in Detroit where he plunged into the  struggle to organize the automobile workers in  Michigan and Indiana.  In a break from organizational drives, Victor  Reuther and Sophie Goodlavich were married  on July 17, 1936, on  the campus of  the  Brookwood Labor College—a rich marriage of  shared labor, love, family, friends, and a common commitment to social justice of 60 years.  A member of UAW Local 174, Victor was a  strike leader during UAW campaigns in Flint  and Detroit. He first came to public attention  through his role in the sit-down strike in the  winter of 1936–1937 against General Motors  in Flint where his voice from the sound truck  rallied the strikers and the women who supported  them. UAW  success  in  that  strike  played a key role in establishing the right of  workers to bargain with auto industry employers. From  that  time  forward he was closely  identified with the dynamic growth of industrial  unionism, not only in the automobile industry,  but throughout America’s basic industries organized by the CIO.  With  the onset of World War  II, Victor  served as Assistant Director of the UAW–CIO  War Policy Division, a department created by  the UAW–CIO to facilitate speedy and orderly  conversion and mobilization of the nation’s urgent defense production.  In  the  spring of  1946, Victor Reuther was appointed Director  of Education for the UAW. In this role he led  a  fundamental approach  in  the development  and consolidation of pro-democratic forces in  the UAW. In the years following World War II,  Victor assisted in the location of trade unionists and social democrats throughout Europe  who had escaped Nazi persecution, bringing  them  to  the attention of Allied occupation  forces in the search for leadership in the re-  establishment of civil democratic government.  He also represented  the CIO on  the Trade  Union Advisory Committee in the conduct of  the European Recovery Program—the Marshall Plan.  On May 24, 1949, in an attack identical to  that against his brother Walter, Victor was  shot by an unknown assailant while reading  the evening paper in his living room. He suffered very serious injuries including the loss of  his right eye.  Victor Reuther served as European Representative of  the CIO, with headquarters  in  Paris, France,  from  January 1951  through  1953. His work led to a greatly expanded program of assistance to the free European labor  movement. Representing  the CIO, he  implemented the program of trade union aid for the  democratic European  unions. Awards  bestowed by the governments of Germany and  Sweden, noted below, reflect the multiple contributions of Victor Reuther  in  international  leadership and accomplishments  in  freedom,  democracy, and social justice.  With  their  return  to  the United States  in  1954,  the Victor Reuther  family made  their  home in Washington, DC—the family home for  the next 50 years. That home not only served  the family, but it served as a most hospitable  refuge for friends, the extended family, trade  union colleagues, social activists and  international visitors for all those years.  On his return from Europe, Victor served as  Assistant to the President of the National CIO  and Director of the CIO’s Department for International Affairs. Following the AFL–CIO merger, he served as Administrative Assistant  to  the  President  of  the  International Union,  United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural  Implement Workers of America (UAW), and as  Director, UAW Department of International Affairs. His contributions  to  international social  development programs extended to Asia, Africa, and Latin America as well as in the United  States. He worked intensively in India, South  Vietnam, Israel and the Mediterranean countries for the purpose of initiating programs designed to deal with food deficits, the need for  democratic  leadership and skilled manpower  requirements. One of these undertakings was  the  joint effort of  the UAW with  the Peace  Corps under which the union participated in a  mechanical training program in the African Republics of Guinea and Gambia and in Bolivia.  Victor Reuther  retired  from his  formal  responsibilities in the UAW in 1972, but he always remained a committed member of that  union he loved. Throughout the following 28  years he continued  to direct his heart, his  mind and his voice in advocacy of democratic  trade  unionism,  social  justice,  and  understanding among all people. In his initial years  of  retirement he  researched and wrote The  Brothers Reuther, and the Story of the UAW,  A Memoir, a history of family and of the UAW.  In the early 1980s, with the strong encouragement of his wife, Sophie, Victor returned  attention to ongoing trade union issues. Joining with other activists he gave active support  to the Association for Union Democracy and to  Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which won  major changes in unions. He maintained close  fraternal  contact with  the Canadian Auto  VerDate May 21 2004  02:37 Jul 17, 2004 Jkt 029061 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15JY8.038 E16PT1 ",2004
1416,152,2004-07-16,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of S. Con. Res. 114, a resolution that recognizes the importance of food  distribution in schools and expresses gratitude  to  former Senators George McGovern  of  South Dakota and Robert Dole of Kansas for  their efforts to eliminate hunger and poverty.  The McGovern-Dole  International Food  for  Education program began in 2001 as an initiative called the Global Food for Education program. This program provided food to improve  nutrition for mothers, infants, preschoolers and  schoolchildren in developing countries.  During the pilot program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture donated about 800,000  metric tons of commodities, providing school  meals for nearly 7 million children in 38 countries.  Because of the Global Food for Education  program’s  success,  this  initiative was  expanded,  renamed  the McGovern-Dole  International Food for Education Program, and authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. As a conferee on the  Farm Bill, I am proud to have played a part in  enacting the McGovern-Dole program.  Through  the McGovern-Dole program,  the  USDA  is able  to distribute  foods such as  wheat, flour, rice, corn and other basic items.  Being from Kansas, I am glad that one of my  State’s main crops—wheat—goes  to such a  noble cause.  This noble cause includes three main goals:  to reduce hunger, to improve literacy and to  improve primary education. Private, voluntary  organizations, cooperatives, intergovernmental  organizations and governments of developing  countries all  contribute  to achieving  these  goals.  McGovern-Dole was launched on March 10,  2003, on the 50th anniversary of the creation  of the Foreign Agricultural Service. This timing  is appropriate since McGovern-Dole combines  two of  the USDA’s broad goals:  to provide  food in schools and to provide foreign food assistance.  About  120 million  school-aged  children  around the world are not enrolled in school, in  part because of hunger or malnutrition. A disproportionate number of  these children are  girls. By supporting this resolution, we in Congress can help reaffirm the U.S. commitment  to education and child development.  Supporting  this  resolution  demonstrates  support for a better future for our global society. By providing food for schoolchildren in developing countries, we can help to reduce poverty and malnounshment. We can increase the  number of children attending schools. By feeding and educating children around the world,  we are able to open doors for these children  and give  them a  real chance  to someday  achieve their dreams.  I want to thank Senator ELIZABETHDOLE for  introducing this resolution in the Senate and  my colleague, Congressman JAMESMCGOVERN, for introducing it in the House. I thank  these Members for recognizing the efforts of  my fellow Kansan and predecessor, Bob Dole.  I also thank the House International Relations  Committee for their consideration of this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Committee on Government Reform, I am  pleased to rise in support of H.R. 4381.  The Congress names post offices after  numerous Americans,  some  famous,  some anonymous, who devote inordinate time, energy, and resources to  constructive causes, to their communities, or to the greater public. And  today,  through  the consideration of  H.R. 4381, we recognize a couple that is  among the most deserving to be honored by Congress with a local post office.  Mr. Speaker, Harvey  and Bernice  Jones dedicated literally a lifetime of  service to the people of Arkansas. The  Joneses gave away literally millions of  dollars  to  schools,  to hospitals,  to  charities, most of them in northwest  Arkansas, through the Harvey and Bernice Jones Charitable Trust.  After Harvey died in 1989, Bernice established the Harvey and Bernice Jones  Eye Institute at the University of Arkansas Medical Center in Little Rock  in 1994. The next year Bernice opened  the Harvey and Bernice Jones Center  for Families and Children in Springdale. The  center, which  features a  swimming pool and ice skating rink,  continues to positively mentor youths.  President Clinton took notice of Mrs.  Jones’s work in his home State and  awarded Bernice the Presidential Citizens Medal for her benevolence to humanity on February 22, 1996.  Bernice  Jones  passed  away  September 10, 2003. And I thank the gentleman  from Arkansas  (Congressman  for advancing this  legislation on behalf of Harvey and Bernice  Jones. This beloved couple deserves to  be remembered by the people of Springdale  forever. This post office should  serve as a wonderful memorial to their  compassion.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
1425,11,2004-09-07,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the  House Committee on Government Reform, I am pleased to join with my colleagues  in the consideration of H.R.  BOOZMAN)  4381, legislation naming a postal facility in Springdale, Arkansas, after Harvey and Bernice Jones. This measure,  which was  introduced  by  the  gentleman from Arkansas (Representative  BOOZMAN) on May 18, 2004, and unanimously reported by our committee on  July 8, 2004, enjoys the support and cosponsorship of  the Arkansas delegation.  As my colleagues have heard, the  late Harvey and Bernice Jones were  founders of a nonprofit organization,  the Jones Center  for Families. The  mission of the center is to ‘‘serve families, strengthen community, and glorify God.’’ The organization, which provided a host of needed community services including health, education, and  recreational facilities, was founded to  improve the lives of those in need of assistance and guidance.  In  1996 President William Clinton  awarded Mrs. Bernice Young Jones the  Presidential Citizen Medal. Throughout her life, Mrs. Jones donated millions of dollars to assist  individuals  and families.  Mr. Harvey Jones, who built one of  the largest trucking companies in the  country, was also a generous contributor  to  charitable  organizations.  Sadly, he passed in 1989, and Mrs. Jones  passed away last year.  I commend my colleagues for sponsoring this bill, and I urge its quick  passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.

Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to  introduce legislation to my fellow colleagues to name the post office at 2811  Springdale Avenue in Springdale, Arkansas,  after  Harvey  and  Bernice  Jones. Harvey and Bernice Jones are  known throughout Arkansas for their  amazing generosity and compassion for  their community. Harvey Jones first  started the Springdale Transportation  Company in 1919 and soon changed the  name  to Jones Truck Lines,  Incorporated, which later became one of the  largest privately owned trucking companies in the United States. In 1938 the  couple married and together used their  success to further the improvement of  their community and their home State  of Arkansas.  The Joneses were instrumental in the  development of Springdale’s first hospital, and in 1992 Bernice Jones continued their support for the hospital by  pledging $25 million to the Northwest  Medical Center of Washington County.  Furthermore,  the couple provided a  wing of the hospital for family members who want to stay close to their  loved ones.

Mr.  Speaker, over 200 days ago I started  speaking about September 13. That is  the day when the assault weapons ban  that we have in place now is going to  expire.  Over the last couple of years, and  then even this week when we saw the  tragedy that happened in Russia, we  saw what terrorists could do when they  put their minds to having destruction.  They do not care about human life. We  are told that we have terrorists here in  this country waiting to do their destruction on us as American citizens.  We are told that when they can, they  will do as much destruction as possible.  Come September  13, at midnight,  your local terrorists, the gangs that  are in our streets, the drug dealers,  will be able to buy assault weapons at  your local gun store.  I do not understand this. We hear the  rhetoric all the time that the assault  weapons bill has not worked. Well, you  talk to the police officers that are  coming down here tomorrow to try to  convince the President to expand the  bill. We have seen a 60 percent drop in  killings with the guns that have been  banned.  b2015  Our local police say they are not prepared for this. The bulletproof vests  that we give our police officers are no  match to the guns that are going to be  back out on the streets. The large-capacity clips, right now we hold it at 15,  10, and yet  in our States when our  hunters go out shooting  for deer or  hunting, they are only allowed 6 bullets. But we are going to give people  anywhere like the killer today in Ohio  that used 50 rounds. Where is the common sense?  We have the majority of the American people wanting to keep this ban in  place. We have 56 percent of gun owners, NRA members that say, keep the  ban in place. Yet there is total silence  here in this House. The bill is not going  to be allowed to be brought up even for  a vote. But by the way, on Monday  there will be a suspension vote to allow  guns back into the D.C. area and not to  punish anyone that is carrying an unlicensed gun.  Is this where we as Americans want  to be? The rhetoric that we hear constantly, as if this is a slippery road, we  are out to take away everyone’s right  to own a gun. Well, that is not the slippery road. We are trying to save lives.  Ten years ago we put this bill  in  place because too many of our police  officers  were  being  killed  and  outgunned. Come Tuesday morning of  next week, September 14, when our  kids are going back to school, our police officers are going to be in harm’s  way once again. The President of the  United States has said that he would  sign the bill if it got on his desk. Well,  you cannot have  it  two ways, Mr.  President. You have to make the phone  call here. You have  to  tell DENNIS  HASTERT, we want the bill up here. And  like your  father  before you, make  phone calls to say, get this bill passed,  as Ronald Reagan did, as President  Carter did, and as President Clinton  did.  We cannot save every life. There is  no bill in the world that is going to be  able to do that. But when we have  something  in place  that has  saved  lives, why would we just let it go? The  NRA, are they that strong? Where are  the voices of  the American people?  Where is this House, and where is this  President? Whose side are they going  to be on? The police officers that we  talk about that are so heroic from 9/11  and  through  the  convention  and  through all of  the  terrorist  threats  that we have, where are the voices that  are going to protect those police officers? We are just going to let it go?  Who is going to face the families? Who  is going to talk to the surviving families when the  first police officer  is  mowed down? Who is going to do that?  It always seems that I am the one who  has to talk to the victims’ families.  We have several days left. We have  all of the police and the police chiefs  coming in tomorrow. Mr. President, I  am begging you, get on the phone.  Make this happen. We can pass it in  the Senate, and we can pass it here in  the House, but we need your help.

1444,25,2004-09-07,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, in November of 2000, America witnessed the  breakdown  of  its  electoral  system.  Four years later, as far as I can see,  nothing  that was  broken has  been  fixed. Many Americans  believe  the  same injustices to democracy that we  witnessed 4 years ago could occur once  again this November.  The very security of our democracy  is at stake. For all of the Bush administration’s talk about securing our Nation from the threat of terrorism, no  discussion of security would be complete if it did not address the need to  secure our national election system.  After the controversial election  in  2000, one would think President Bush  would do everything in his power to ensure the integrity of America’s election  system. I know that is what I would  have done had I become President of  this United States, particularly after  having lost the national popular vote  by more than half a million votes. But  unfortunately,  despite  some Democratic efforts here in Congress, this administration has failed to win back the  trust of our Nation’s voters.  The Help America Vote Act, which  was signed into law in the year 2002,  was designed to assist States in upgrading their fragile election systems.  I supported this legislation because it  took steps  in the right direction to  make  our  election  system  secure.  While some improvements have been  made because of this act, its most useful reforms, the reforms that would actually ensure security, will not be in  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:51 Sep 08, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07SE7.047 H07PT1 ",2004
1445,39,2004-09-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments, because we need to point to personal examples to show how the policies of this  administration are impacting real people, and I think that that is really one  of the best. I am sure that is one of  those tax loopholes that was put into  the jobs bill, or whatever that bill was  called, the tax bill of the Committee on  Ways and Means at the request of the  small aircraft companies, and it is just  incredible.  I want to yield to the gentleman  from Maine, but first, one of the people  that came into my office when I had an  open house one day, and I said it was  mostly about health care and the loss  of health insurance, was a guy from  Edison, New Jersey, which is my largest  town,  and  he worked  for  the  Frigadaire plant, which made refrigerators, air conditioners, that kind of  thing, and the plant closed this year  and there were 1,500 jobs, they all went  to China. And he came to my office because under the Job Retraining Act or  something that Republicans, whenever  they pass these trade bills, they say oh,  do not worry, because we are going to  provide all kinds of retraining. And as  my colleagues know, President Bush  has cut all of the retraining money, so  whatever was promised out there when  you lost your job that you are going to  get retrained, most of that has disappeared. In New Jersey, it has pretty  much dried up, the Federal dollars.  So he came in and he actually found  a job which paid a little less and did  not have quite the benefits of the one  he lost, but still was a pretty good job.  In order to get it, he had to go through  some training program that was supposedly funded by the Federal Government. When he showed up at the training program, they told him that the  money had been cut, there was not any  more money. So he actually lost the  job. It was an opportunity to find a job  that paid a reasonable amount, and he  lost  the  job  because  the  training  money was not there.  Every promise that we get from this  administration, whether it is prescription drugs, or expanded health care, or  more opportunities for college, or retraining, if you lose your job, it just all  ends up being not true. I mean I do not  know how to say it. I do not want to  say it is a lie, but it is just not true.  The funding is not there, the programs  are not there. It is just a lot of hype,  and that is what we are getting and  continue to get from this administration. But I want to thank the gentlewoman for providing a really good example. Thanks.  I yield to the gentleman from Maine,  one of our champions on the health  care issue.  ",2004
1446,39,2004-09-07,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  from New Jersey  for  holding this Special Order on whether  or not Americans are better off than  they were 4 years ago. I particularly  want to thank the gentlewoman from  Illinois, because I thought that was a  great example of how the very wealthiest among us can benefit enormously  from the administration’s tax cuts, and  yet the rest of the people are basically  left high and dry. That is why 50 percent of the American people have not  noticed any benefit at all  from the  Bush tax cuts.  But that is a very good example, because it is possible, as we all know in  politics, to repeat something over and  over again, even if it is not true, and  persuade a certain number of people  that it is. I give my colleagues this example. I was coming down from Maine  on the plane today and talking to the  fellow on the plane and we got talking  about these tax cuts which most people  know are weighted for the wealthiest  people in this country. And he said,  Well, but don’t these small businessmen and women, aren’t they the ones  who create most of the jobs? And you  realize what  the administration has  been able to do. They have been able to  hoodwink a certain percentage of the  American people  into believing that  the very, very wealthiest people in this  country are the small businessmen and  women. Well, small businessmen and  women in my State are not making $1  million a year. Maybe a few are, and I  hope we will have more of them. But  the cold, hard truth is, a lot of them  are struggling to get by. They are really struggling with the rapid rise  in  their health care costs, but it simply is  not true that the Bush tax cuts go to  the small business community in general.  But what  the  administration has  done and what the Republicans in Congress have done  is marvelous. They  have described as a small businessman  the typical person who is worth a half  a billion dollars, a half a billion dollars, and just because he or she has  some investment somewhere in some  small business, they are described as a  small businessman. That is what they  have done to distort the truth.  If you stand back and go to the question that you posed earlier, are most  Americans better off today than they  were 4 years ago? That is an appropriate question to ask. Because though  elections are about  the  future,  the  record of the incumbent is really something that needs to be examined. The  President and the congressional Republicans are saying, stay the course. We  are back on track.

1456,60,2004-09-07,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. Copps makes the  point that we give broadcasters the  right to use the airwaves in exchange  for their agreement to broadcast in the  public interest. They don’t own the airwaves. They are licensed to use them  in exchange  for broadcasting  in the  public  interest. They also earn substantial money in broadcasting properties  from advertising during  television campaigns. It is expected they  will earn nearly $1.5 billion from political advertising.  What do we get in return? We get almost no coverage any  longer, very  spartan coverage of the two political  conventions. Television and other executives say: That is because people  can watch the conventions on cable television. Well, there are more channels.  There is cable. But 35 million Americans don’t get cable television.  Let me take a look at what has happened, as Mr. Copps describes it in his  piece. On Monday, August 30, the Republican Convention was held in New  York. This is a Monday evening. None  of the networks decided they would  cover the Republican Convention. It is  strange for me to be protesting that,  but nonetheless I think the networks  have a responsibility and should have  had a responsibility to provide extensive coverage of both political conventions. So on Monday night, they did  not  show  the American people  the  speech by Senator MCCAIN, our colleague.  Incidentally,  I  think  that  speech should have been heard by the  American people. They didn’t air the  speech by Rudy Giuliani. The American people  should have heard  that  speech. Why is it they couldn’t have  done that?  Let me show you what they were airing on Monday evening. They had ‘‘Access Hollywood.’’ That was important.  Then they went to ‘‘Fear Factor.’’ That  is where you sometimes tune in and  you  see  people  eating  a  bowl  of  maggots or whatever other disgusting  thing happens on ‘‘Fear Factor.’’ I have  seen it as I have used the remote control to change the channels. ‘‘Complex  Malibu,’’  they  aired—eight  couples  begin the competition by working on a  master bedroom—and NFL preseason,  and the ‘‘Last Comic Standing.’’  The American people couldn’t get the  Republican Convention  that evening  because this is what was aired on television. This was a Monday evening, the  first evening of the convention.  What about the Democratic Convention?  The  networks  decided  they  wouldn’t broadcast on Tuesday evening  of the Democratic Convention. They  broadcast three nights, 1 hour each  evening for three nights. On Tuesday  evening, July 27, the keynote speaker  Barak Obama  spoke, Teresa Heinz  spoke. The American people didn’t get  to  listen  to  those  speeches. They  should have been able to.  Here  is what was going on. They  aired that evening ‘‘Trading Spouses,  Meet Your New Mommy,’’  ‘‘Wheel of  Fortune,’’  ‘‘Last  Comic  Standing,’’  ‘‘Quintuplets,’’  ‘‘The Amazing Race,’’  eight teams travel from Argentina to  St. Petersburg, Russia. The networks  were too busy. They didn’t want to put  on 2 hours a night for four nights, or  four hours a night, they used to do  that.  Some people say the conventions are  staged. Really? Well, there are a lot of  stories at the conventions. But those  stories are not covered these days by  the major broadcast networks. Why?  Because they are only broadcasting 1  hour a night, three nights; 3 hours,  total 6 hours, for both the Republican  and the Democratic National Conventions; 6 hours every 4 years. How does  that relate to the obligation to serve in  the public interest? How does that relate to what Senator LOTTand I and  others have been talking about, how a  few people decide what the American  people read or hear? How many people  do you think made the decision we will  only offer 3 hours to the American people of the Republican National Convention on the major networks? How many  people do you think made the decision  we will only offer 3 hours of the Democratic Convention?  I think both the Republican Convention and the Democratic Convention  were shortchanged. Why do I say that?  Because the fact is, we make decisions  in the political process. Our major national conventions are a  significant  part of the process. The dialog, the discussion, the debate in those conventions is a significant part of showing  and telling the American people what  these political parties are about.

1459,67,2004-09-07,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, the new  deficit numbers came out today from  the Congressional Budget Office. They  show that we will now run the largest  deficit in the history of the country—  some $422 billion. That is nearly $50 billion more than last year, and it should  alarm every Member of this body and  certainly every Member of the Congress. We are headed in a direction that  is utterly unsustainable.  When the President was asked about  this in a recent interview on NBC, the  questioner said this to him:  Let me ask you about deficits. This year,  $445 billion, ballpark. Do you think that’s  pretty good?  The President said:  Yes. I do. I do.  When you are running the worst deficits in the history of the country, to  think that is good news I find unusual.  This is not good news. It reminds me a  little of the captain of the Titanic when  the ship is going down saying: Well,  there is good news here because the  ship is not sinking as fast as I thought  it would.  We can’t continue with deficits of  this magnitude. This President ran on  the promise that he was going to be fiscally  responsible. But  look  at  his  record compared to the previous three  Presidents: President Reagan  ran a  large deficit; President Bush  1  ran  large deficits—in fact, the largest deficit in history in his final year; under  President Clinton, we had deficit improvement each and every year. We  climbed up out of the red ink, and for  several years—in fact, 4 years—we were  deficit free. Now President Bush took  over, and each and every year the deficits have gotten worse. In fact, we can  all recall that he inherited a substantial budget surplus—$127 billion. Then  each and every year the deficits have  gotten much worse.  One of the things that is most alarming and ought to concern people the  most is that the amount of deficit this  year—$422 billion—is not the amount  by which the debt will increase. I think  there is a lot of confusion.  I taught economics classes at the  universities  in my State during the  break. I find there is a lot of confusion  between the deficit and the debt. The  deficit, of course,  is the annual difference between what we  raise and  what we spend. That is the annual difference. The debt is the accumulation  of all the deficits over time. But it is  also true that the deficits printed in  the newspapers badly understate how  much the debt is increased. The biggest  reason for that is they leave Social Security  in the calculation. Of course,  Social Security is supposed to be separate, it is supposed to be apart, and  even by law Social Security is supposed  to be separate. But that is not the way  we have it treated in the newspaper.  They put  everything  into one pot.  When you do that, you hide the fact  that they are going to borrow this year  nearly $150 billion from Social Security. That gets added onto the debt, but  it doesn’t count as deficit.  It is kind of a bizarre way we do accounting here in Washington. There is  no other  institution  in the country  that would be able to do what we do  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:45 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S07SE4.REC S07SE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

1466,74,2004-09-07,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I want  to express my strong support for the  nomination of Justice Michael Schneider to serve on the District Court for  the Eastern District of Texas.  First, I say thank you to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as the ranking  member, Senator LEAHY, for working  with us to try to fill this important vacancy in the Eastern District of Texas.  The vacancy that will be filled by  this nomination was created by the untimely passing of Chief Judge John H.  Hannah, Jr. Judge Hannah was a good  man and a distinguished  jurist. His  family’s loss was also a great loss to  the State of Texas.  I have enjoyed working with Judge  Hannah throughout his career. I recall  working with him on a variety of matters when he served as secretary of  state of Texas from 1991 to 1994. And  Senator HUTCHISONand I worked closely with him just last year on legislation to authorize the Eastern District  of Texas to hold court in the city of  Plano. That bill, S. 1720, was important  to Judge Hannah, who always worked  hard to serve the citizens of the Eastern District. He passed away the day  after the President signed that legislation into law.  The death of Judge Hannah leaves  some big shoes to fill, but President  Bush could not have filled them better  than with the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Judge Michael Haygood  Schneider.  Justice Schneider will bring to the  Federal  district  court  the wisdom,  judgment, and experience of over a  quarter  century  of  service  on  the  bench. He understands—as any good  judge must—that the duty of a judge is  to interpret the law, not to legislate  from the bench.  Justice Schneider has held virtually  every position in the State court system that Texas has to offer. From 1978  to 1990, he served on the West University Place Municipal Court. Then, he  served on the 157th District Court of  Texas, located in Houston, until 1996.  Next, he became Chief Justice of the  First Court of Appeals in Houston. He  served there until 2002, when he was appointed Justice of the Supreme Court  of Texas, where I once served. He has  been honored as both Trial Judge of  the Year and Appellate Judge of the  Year by the Texas Association of Civil  Trial and Appellate Specialists.  In  addition  to  this  extraordinary  record  of  judicial  service,  Justice  Schneider also served the people of  Texas in the role of Assistant District  Attorney  for Harris County. Justice  Schneider is a graduate of Stephen F.  Austin State University, the University of Houston College of Law, and—  more recently—the LL.M. program of  the University of Virginia Law School.  And he has a distinguished record of  civic involvement.  Justice Schneider’s reputation as an  exceptional  jurist  and  a  true  gentleman is well known throughout the  State of Texas. It is also well known by  the American Bar Association, which  gave him its highest rating, when its  standing committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously certified him as  ‘‘well qualified’’ for the Federal bench.  And his nomination enjoys broad bipartisan  support  across  the  State  of  Texas. For example, Susan Hays, who  chairs the Dallas County Democratic  Party, has written a strong letter of  support.  Justice Schneider is also a humble  man. His profile on the Texas Supreme  Court’s website points out that ‘‘[h]e  held a variety of jobs during college  and law school,’’ including ‘‘searching  titles at a major oil company, managing apartments, driving ambulances,  operating a  school bus  for disabled  children, working at a funeral home,  teaching school, delivering milk, clerking for a law firm, managing a college  cafeteria, serving as a waiter, bell hopping at a hotel, and serving as an intern at the United States Attorney’s  Office.’’ I’m tempted to ask him which  of these jobs best prepares him for life  as a Federal district judge.  I am pleased that the President has  nominated Justice Schneider to serve  on the Eastern District of Texas, and I  look forward to his service on the Federal bench in the great State of Texas.  Daniel Webster said that justice is  the greatest desire of man on Earth. It  is, I suppose, the reverence we have for  the aspiration of justice that we honor  men and women by allowing them to  wear a black robe and to judge us.  Justice Schneider, as the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee has already  noted, has had a distinguished judicial  career of having served at all levels of  the Texas State  judiciary. Beyond  that, Justice Schneider has a reputation for being a gentleman, being an  honorable person and one who will do  well in this important position.  I ask my colleagues to support this  nomination. I say how delighted I am,  given this late point in the year when  many judicial nominations would not  ordinarily be brought up, that there  has been bipartisan consensus that this  good man and this good judge be put up  for an up-or-down vote.  I also ask unanimous  consent  to  print in the RECORDa letter from the  Dallas County Democratic Party.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  DALLASCOUNTYDEMOCRATICPARTY,  July 6, 2004.  Chairman ORRING. HATCH,  Senator PATRICKJ. LEAHY,  Senator JOHNCORNYN,  Members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.  Re Nomination of Michael H. Schneider, Sr.  for the United States District Judge for  the Eastern District of Texas  OF THE COMMITTEE:  THEMEMBERS TO I  write to encourage you to confirm the nomination of Justice Schneider. As the Dallas  County Democratic Chair, I supported Justice Linda Yan˜ez, Justice Schneider’s opponent in his 2002 race for the Texas Supreme  Court. During that election season I learned  a great deal about Justice Schneider, namely  how well-regarded and well-respected he is  by the bench and the bar in Texas. Even the  plaintiff’s bar in Houston, Justice Schneider’s home base, supported his race out of respect for his dedication to following the law.  During his tenure on the Texas Supreme  Court I have followed his performance closely. (I served as a law clerk on the court during the 1997–1998 term, and specialize in civil  appellate work in my law practice.) While on  the Court he has been a voice of moderation  and judicial conservatism. In the many conversations I have had with Texas appellate  lawyers—of  all  political  persuasions—the  overwhelming  consensus  is  that  Justice  Schneider has done a wonderful job on the  Court and fully deserves to be elevated to  the federal bench. Justice Schneider is dedicated to the rule of law and the integrity of  the judicial system. The only reservation I  have about his nomination is that I hate to  lose his  influence on the Texas Supreme  Court. In addition to being a Democrat, I am  a member of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association and the Dallas Trial Lawyers Association. Speaking both as a Democrat and as  a plaintiff’s lawyer, I urge the Committee to  confirm Justice Schneider.  While much has been made in the press  about partisan gridlock over judicial nominations, as a partisan leader and as a lawyer  I know there are times the parties should  come together to support a nominee. This is  such a time. I urge the Committee to vote on  Justice Schneider’s nomination at Wednesday’s hearing. A quick vote is critical this  late in an election year. if you have any  questions about my support of his nomination, please call me at 214–557–4819.  Sincerely,  SUSANHAYS,  Chair.  ",2004

MADD and its mission ‘‘to stop  drunk driving, support victims of this  violent crime and prevent underage  drinking’’  has  become  the  largest  crime victims’ assistance organization  in the world, with more than 3 million  members and supporters.  This month marks the 20th anniversary of South Dakota’s Pennington  County chapter of MADD. MADD Pennington County shares this anniversary with the enactment of the National Uniform 21 Minimum Drinking  Age Act, one of  the organization’s  greatest victories. Since the law was  passed in 1984, over 20,000 young lives  have been saved from highway crashes.  Much of  that  success  is  thanks  to  MADD’s efforts to change public attitudes and raise social awareness of the  dangers of impaired driving.  We still have much to do. Since 2000,  about half of all the traffic related  deaths in South Dakota were alcohol  related. In the face of this challenge,  the MADD  chapter  of  Pennington  County has been active in outreach, coordinating with the police department  to educate the owners and staffs of restaurants and bars, as well as high  school and college students.  Two women in particular have made  a difference, and they deserve special  recognition. Lila Doud, who is the current Chapter President,  and Janice  Morehouse,  the  Secretary/Treasurer,  have been working with the MADD  Pennington County chapter since its  inception 20 years ago. All the volunteers  and  sponsors  of MADD Pennington County have much to be proud  of and I am grateful for their commitment to public safety, victim services,  and education. All of South Dakota  owes them a great debt and we thank  them for their service.  f  THE RIGHT COURSE FOR THE  ECONOMY  ",2004

To that end, I would like to call the  Senate’s attention  to  two pieces of  commentary written by Leo Hindery,  Jr. and published over the summer recess.  Mr. Hindery, as many of my colleagues are aware, has served as the  CEO of TCI and AT&T Broadband, and  more recently as the chairman of the  YES Network. He has a keen understanding that corporations have obligations both to their shareholders, but  also to the communities in which they  operate, and the American economy  they fuel.  Mr. Hindery’s first piece is on the  subject of outsourcing, and he argues  that offshoring of  jobs  is not  inevitable, nor is it often the best long-term  strategy for American companies.  His second talks about the need to  see through the sky-is-falling claims of  some interest groups and weigh both  policy and electoral decisions on a simple standard—what is the best thing to  do, not just for a few who are well-off  and well-connected, but for the economy as a whole?  Again, I think these pieces of insight  and analysis would be of interest to  those of us who are entrusted to make  decisions about the policies America  adopts, and I ask unanimous consent  that they be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:45 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S07SE4.REC S07SE4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004
1473,88,2004-09-07,Mr. COLEMAN.," Mr. President, it is  truly an honor and a privilege to take  this opportunity to pay tribute to Paul  Molitor, an incredible individual and a  tremendous baseball player from the  city of Saint Paul, MN. Paul will forever be  remembered as one of  the  greatest to ever play the game, but  most of all he will be remembered as a  hometown hero to many Minnesotans.  In recognition of his achievements and  dedication to the sport, Paul has been  inducted  into  the National Baseball  Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. This  is a tribute not only to his abilities on  the field, but also to his commitment  to the community. It is my great privilege to highlight his accomplishments  before the United States Senate and  this Nation.  Paul’s humble beginnings were that  of many young Minnesotans. At the  age of four, it was clear that a passion  for  baseball was  developing  in  the  heart of this young Midwestern boy.  Every where he went, Paul would carry  his mitt with him. He shined as a star  athlete  for  the Raiders  of Cretin-  Derham Hall High School  in Saint  Paul. For his college education, he  stuck close  to home and became a  Golden Gopher by attending the University of Minnesota. At the U of M,  Paul was a three-year starter and a  two-time All-American before he made  the decision  to  sign with  the Milwaukee Brewers as the third overall  pick in the 1977 Major League Baseball  draft.  After only a short time in the minor  leagues, Paul earned a  role as  the  starting shortstop and  leadoff hitter  for the Brewers. This position would be  one of many that this versatile athlete  would  play  throughout  his  record-  breaking career. Paul reached many  milestones that few players would ever  meet. He is one of only five players  with over 3,000 hits and over 500 steals,  the others being legendary players Ty  Cobb, Honus Wagner, Eddie Collins,  and Lou Brock. Paul is in the top ten  all-time in at-bats, hits, singles, and  doubles, and in the top twenty all-time  in  runs  scored,  triples,  and  stolen  bases. Paul also tops the list as the  only player in Major League Baseball  history with 3,000 hits, 500 stolen bases,  and 200 home runs. All of these are  great accomplishments, but perhaps  his greatest feat came in 1993, when the  Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series and Paul was recognized as the  most valuable player.  Outside of baseball, Paul  is well-  known as one that actively gives back  to his community. In 1998, he was honored with the Branch Rickey Award,  which is given to baseball players that  show unparalleled devotion to serving  their community. In addition to this,  Paul was  also  recognized  for  his  strength of  character when he was  awarded  the Lou Gehrig Memorial  Award, given to those who best exemplify  the  giving  character  of Lou  Gehrig, another hall-of-famer.  Paul Molitor has come a long way  from the sandlots of Saint Paul to the  ballparks of Major League Baseball. In  twenty-one seasons, Paul played with  three major league clubs, before coming back home to play for his hometown team, the Minnesota Twins, in  1996. It is quite clear that Paul Molitor  is a person whose dedication and hard  work brought him to the pinnacle of  Major League Baseball. His  talent,  commitment, and  love  for the game  have led to his selection into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. It is my  distinct  pleasure  to  recognize  his  achievements before the United States  Senate, and I wish him all the best in  his future endeavors.  Paul, you have made many proud—  your fans, teammates, and the State of  Minnesota. You are a true hometown  her. Congratulations on your induction  into  the National Baseball Hall of  Fame.∑  f  HONORING ROY SNYDER  ∑",2004
1474,88,2004-09-07,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President, I honor a  great public servant, Roy Snyder. Roy  Snyder is retiring after 27 years of providing exemplary service to America.  His career began in 1962, with the Bureau of Land Management. He then  served our Country for over 10 years in  the United States Army where he attained the rank of Captain. He then  turned his abilities to Corps of Engineers. For the last 15 years, it has been  Montana’s fortune to have Roy as Operations Manager at Fort Peck Lake.  He assumed this position with the determination  to make  changes  that  would benefit the public. He accomplished that mission. Fort Peck Lake  saw many positive changes under Mr.  SNYDER’s oversight. Without his support and encouragement, Fort Peck  would still be a little known and little  used recreation site.  It has been my honor and privilege to  work with him on significant projects  that have  benefited not  just Montanans, but all recreational users of  Fort Peck. With Roy’s help the roads  around Fort Peck have been improved,  the campgrounds have been improved,  there is a breakwater, Lewis and Clark  sites, fishing access sites, a fish hatchery,  the  Interpretive Center. All of  these are due in large part, to Roy’s tenacious ability to make things happen.  Even more important, he has created  relationships between users that never  existed before. People who didn’t realize they had anything in common are  now working together. He has worked  to turn a lack of communication into  an open  line that benefits everyone  who uses Fort Peck.  Even in times of adversity, Roy has  been a stalwart supporter of the recreational users. He put the public’s  need before all others and worked to  ensure they had the chance to make  the most of Fort Peck Lake. It is my  honor to commend Roy Snyder for his  27 years of service. It is even more of  an honor for me to refer to Roy as my  friend. Roy, thank you for everything  you have done to make Fort Peck Lake  what it is today. We will all miss you.∑  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF J. IRWIN  MILLER  ∑",2004
1475,88,2004-09-07,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to honor the life of my fellow  Hoosier, Joseph Irwin Miller, who died  on Monday, August 16, at the age of 95.  J. Irwin Miller was a leading industrialist who used his business success as  an opportunity to give back to his  community  by  helping Hoosiers  in  need, advancing greater social change  through example and turning Columbus,  IN,  into an architectural  landmark.  Joseph Irwin Miller was a fourth-generation Hoosier, born in 1909 to Hugh  and Nettie Miller. He graduated from  Yale University in 1931 and joined his  family’s bank 3 years later. His family  also owned Cummins, a  local diesel  maker  that Miller would  transform  into a Fortune 500 company recognized  around  the world.  On  his watch,  Cummins increased its sales five times  over, to $100 million by 1955. From a  small-town company with 60 employees, J.

1477,123,2004-09-07,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Indiana is recognized.  ,2004
1478,123,2004-09-07,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President,  it  is a  privilege for me to join my esteemed  colleague Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania and Senators LIEBERMANand  MCCAINin this effort to implement the  9/11 Commission recommendations to  defend our country.  This is a bipartisan undertaking. We  have proven we can rise above partisan  politics. It remains to be seen whether  we can rise above the bureaucratic inertia, gridlock, and turf jealousy that  all too often afflict the Federal Government. I believe we must and I believe we can, if we are to uphold the  weighty responsibility placed on us by  our fellow American citizens.  The most  important thing we can  bring to this task is a sense of urgency.  What began as a wake-up call on September 11 may not be answered following  this November  2, unless we  maintain the momentum generated by  the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. All too often the country’s attention, this body’s attention, can be  diverted into other arenas, keeping us  from taking a difficult but necessary  action that sustained focus and attention can achieve.  So I am very insistent that we regain  the momentum, bring a sense of urgency and purpose to this calling, because it is what will be necessary to  break down some of the barriers that  too often in the past have kept us from  doing what we now know to be important in terms of defending this country.  Our proposal is the most comprehensive one before the Congress. It addresses not only identifying and cracking  down  on  terrorists who would  threaten to do harm to the American  people; it is also the only proposal that  deals with  the  causes—the  environment that gives rise to those violent  individuals in the first place. We have  to do both. If there is one thing I am  absolutely certain of, it is no matter  what resources, focus, and new structure we bring to the challenge of defending our country, we will not be  able to identify and bring to justice  every individual who wishes us harm.  We have to prevent them from being  created in the first place. We need to  do both. That is what this calls for.  We  emphasize  accountability  and  this is vitally important. If you look at  the failings that occurred before 9/11,  and at some of the weaknesses exposed  by the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, you can see there  were some significant problems with  our intelligence system. Yet, as far as  I know, no individual has been admonished, no individual has been demoted,  no  individual has been  fired. George  Tenet fell on his sword and took responsibility. But as far as I know, that  is as far as it goes.  Is this the best we can do in terms of  having a structure that assigns missions and holds people accountable for  successfully fulfilling them? I don’t believe it is. This proposal we have placed  before this Congress insists upon clearly delineated lines of authority, holds  people clearly accountable for carrying  out tasks, with consequences that will  be easier to impose if people do not do  the job we have a right to expect of  them. If I were the President asking  who was responsible or in charge or accountable for this, you would have a  half dozen different  individuals. But  the only individual you can look at and  say this person is in charge of a national security apparatus in this country is the President himself.  Well, that is not good enough because  with all the President has to be responsible  for, he needs to have someone  subordinate  to him, who  is  clearly  identifiable, to bring coherence and accountability to the national security  apparatus. That is what our proposal  would put into place.  Finally, let me say two things. We  need to increase the amount of information available  to our country  in  order to provide for our defense. No  matter what structure we provide, no  matter  how  comprehensive  or  how  much we emphasize accountability, we  simply need to know more about dangerous  individuals, dangerous places,  and what they are doing in an attempt  to harm America. There are glaring  blind spots today, when it comes to intelligence, that will make us unable to  defend our country. We are in the process of trying to correct some of those  blind spots, but more needs to be done.  This report focuses like a laser, particularly on  improving  the  level of  human intelligence that will augment  our technology, and other sources at  our disposal to provide for the common  defense.  In conclusion, let me say this. I am  reminded of the old adage, ‘‘Fool me  once, shame on you;  fool me twice,  shame on me.’’ It is no longer possible  to deny there are glaring weaknesses in  the national security intelligence apparatus that sprung up following World  War II. It was designed for a different  time and a different challenge. We  must seize this opportunity and put  into  place  truly  transformational  change that will enable us to defend  our country against the threats of the  21st century, not those that threatened  us in the recent past.  Those who would temporize, equivocate, and those who would unduly compromise will bear a very heavy burden  indeed should another tragedy strike  this country. Now is the time for bold  action. Now is the time to put aside  the bureaucratic turf jealousies, inertia, and divisions that afflict the Congress and the executive branch and  unite politically, unite across branches  of Government, unite in a common purpose of truly bold reform and change,  so that those who follow in our footsteps will know we have done everything humanly possible to protect this  country.  Some of the sacrifices need to start  with this Congress. Too often people  have committee  jealousies and they  want to protect turf. We need to put  that aside and unite as one people, one  Congress, to protect this Nation. That  is what this legislation does. So I am  pleased to join with my colleagues in a  bipartisan spirit to move the  intelligence  system  forward  and  defend  America.  I will conclude with a saying I once  read. I am a member of the Intelligence  Committee. At one of the briefings, we  got what was actually a cover sheet of  the budget for the intelligence community a couple of years ago. The budget  is classified, but this is not. It was a  quote from Napoleon Bonaparte, which  I  found  interesting. Napoleon Bonaparte once said ‘‘a well-placed spy is  worth at  least two divisions.’’ Well,  today a well-placed spy and access to  timely, accurate information could be  worth two American cities;  it could  mean the difference between hundreds  of thousands of lives saved or lost.  Let us not get embroiled in political,  bureaucratic, or other disputes when  the fate of our Nation hangs in the balance. Now is the time to act. I am honored to join with my colleagues in proposing that we do exactly that.  ",2004

These funding increases have allowed  the FBI  to  increase  the number of  Joint Terrorism Task Forces to 100;  create the Office of Intelligence; create  the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, which the administration has done  with FBI, CIA, Homeland Security,  who meet together every day; the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force;  and  the Terrorist Screening Center;  hire thousands of new agents and analysts and support staff, including 620  additional linguists; create new training programs for agents and analysts;  and upgrade the technology capabilities.

We need the jobs bill to help promote  job creation here in the United States  by reducing taxes on United States  manufacturers.  We need the jobs bill to update provisions in the tax code that are decades  old and penalize American companies  and keep them from competing with  foreign companies.  We need the jobs bill to move forward  in the spirit of the bipartisan progress  that has already occurred and has been  made on these issues.  The provisions that some are contesting here on the floor right now won  bipartisan support in the other body  and also here on the House floor. This  bill is not about moving jobs overseas.  It is about creating incentives to keep  jobs right here in the United States.  We need to move the jobs bill to conference, and we should do it without  delay. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to  instruct, to support going to conference  so that we can bring back a conference  report that everybody can support.  ",2004
1494,20,2004-09-29,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I think we  have the right to close, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL) is  not here, and I am not sure he will be  here. We would have divided the balance of the time. He is not here because of the memorial service for our  distinguished, and if I might say, beloved former colleague Frank Horton.  So,  therefore,  under  those  circumstances, I reserve the balance of  the time and I will close.  ",2004
1495,20,2004-09-29,Mr. THOMAS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman, and all of us who served  with the gentleman from New York,  Frank Horton, certainly feel saddened  by his passing.  I will tell the gentleman from Michigan, I have two additional speakers,  and he has the right to close. We will  conclude,  and  the  gentleman  from  Michigan can then close.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is my pleasure to  yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Mrs. JOHNSON), the  subcommittee  chair  of  the  Subcommittee on Health of the Committee  on Ways and Means.  ",2004
1496,20,2004-09-29,Mrs. JOHNSON of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I thank the chairman for the  time.  Let  us  look  at  this  issue  of  outsourcing. Last year, foreign investment in America doubled. That means  that other countries outsourced jobs to  America at twice the rate they had the  preceding year. We need them to keep  doing that!  Next, in the 1980s, I worked hard with  some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle to force Japanese companies producing cars in America to  buy American  parts; not  just hire  American people, buy American parts.  We forced them to do it because we did  not want ‘‘screwdriver’’ plants.  Well, when we produce airplanes in  other countries  for  those countries,  when GE gets a contract to produce locomotives in Russia and rehabilitate  all the Russian locomotives, do my colleagues not think Russia wants some of  those jobs? Do my colleagues not think  Russia wants  some  of  those  parts  bought in Russia? Of course, they do,  but expensive, high-value parts come  from New York State and have kept  our ability to produce locomotives as  one of the foremost capabilities in the  worldwide market.  So, yes, outsourcing is a worldwide  phenomenon, and we are  the beneficiaries far more often than we are the  losers. In net, we are by far the winners.  Secondly,  competitiveness,  absolutely, top in communications, top in  medical technologies. Take the Department of Commerce’s list of the 18 top  technologies, and we are the highest  quality producer and the lowest cost  producer  in two-thirds of them. So,  yes, we are driving the economic forces  of America into the international market, but we must do more. We must  help our companies compete.  We must pass  this  legislation  to  eliminate the retaliatory tariffs that  have been put on American goods,  thereby increasing their price abroad  10 percent and soon to be 15 percent.  We must reduce taxes on our manufacturers that compete internationally.  We must do what we do in this bill,  make it cheaper for them to invest in  machinery  and  equipment  and hire  more people, and yes, we must go further.  We are going to have to do something  to control and reduce health care costs  so they can compete internationally.  We are going to have to eliminate frivolous litigation and all the costs that  that imposes on our industry and particularly on manufacturing, driven by  pure greed.  So let us get with it. Let us pass this  bill, and then let us go right down the  agenda of the things we need to do to  make American manufacturing more  competitive in the international global  market, but let us not pretend that  outsourcing is the villain here. It is  something we need to be able to do  fairly and receive from other countries,  and I urge opposition to this motion.  ",2004

1499,20,2004-09-29,Mr. MCCRERY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the chairman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, this Democratic motion  to instruct conferees reflects what is  their increasingly obvious 19th century  state of mind. One would think, listening to the comments of our colleagues  on the left, that we are back in the industrial  revolution, or maybe,  they  have moved forward to the first part of  the  20th  century, mid-20th  century,  maybe even right after World War II,  when the United States was not only  the biggest and baddest bear in the industrial woods but just about the only  bear  in the  industrial woods. Those  times have changed. This is the 21st  century. The market has changed significantly.  One of my colleagues on the Committee on Ways and Means pointed out  that he learned from Goldman Sachs  that, over the last couple of years, we  have  seen  300,000  to  500,000  jobs  outsourced, in other words, American  companies creating 300,000 to 500,000  jobs off our shores in foreign countries.  That is true.  But what he did not tell my colleagues and what he could have found  out at Goldman Sachs or from our own  Department of Commerce is that, during that same period of time, even  more than 300,000 to 500,000 jobs were  created here in the United States by  foreign companies wanting to access  our market. That is the 21st century  market. No longer are we building infrastructure  to  transport American  made goods from the east coast to the  west coast like we did in the 19th century. Those were great days, but today,  American  companies  have  to  build  some of their things overseas to access  those markets, to compete with the numerous companies that are in competition with them today, unlike the 19th  century and mid-20th century.  In today’s market, we dadgum better  get over there and compete, or we will  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:43 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29SE7.053 H29PT1 ",2004

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 11⁄2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. CAPPS).  ",2004
1501,27,2004-09-29,Mrs. CAPPS.," I thank my colleague  from  the District  of Columbia  for  yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Our troops are struggling in Iraq. The budget deficit is at  an all-time high. The Republican-led  Congress has failed to finish its work  on the budget, on appropriations bills,  the highway bill, all of the legislation  vital to keeping our country going, and  the response from the Republican leadership? Pass a bill repealing gun laws  in the District of Columbia.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bad bill on its  own merit and an affront to the citizens of Washington, D.C. The citizens  of this District have the right to enact  laws to make their neighborhoods safer  without interference from the Congress  and the NRA. This is election-year politics practiced at the expense of District residents who do not even have a  vote in the House or the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, the fight against terrorism is a focus of this Presidential  campaign, as it should be, and the fight  against terrorism  is a given  in our  daily lives. We live in a time of high  alerts. Checkpoints now ring this Capitol. Yet passage of this bill into law  would certainly not aid  in our war  against terrorism. It would in fact encourage proliferation of weapons in the  immediate vicinity of the Capitol, the  White House, the Supreme Court, and  scores of Federal agencies and foreign  embassies located throughout this city.  One would think that our congressional leadership would want us to support the policemen and -women who  work to protect us and these institutions which are such national symbols,  all of which present tempting targets  for terrorists or the deranged.  But this legislation would undermine  the efforts of our local law enforcement and put our police at even greater risk. It is an antipolice bill, abuse of  congressional power, and an attempt to  draw attention away  from what we  should be working on. I urge my colleagues to vote down this ill-conceived  measure.

1503,27,2004-09-29,Mrs. MUSGRAVE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of this legislation. I learned  a long time ago serving in the Colorado  State legislature that criminals do not  care about the laws we pass. They do  not know who their Congressman is.  They do not know who their Senators  are. They do not have respect for law  or lawmakers.  Right here in Washington, D.C., there  are many things that we are extremely  proud of. One of the things, though,  that really is a blot is the infamous  distinction as the murder capital of the  world. I think that we need to give  criminals who would commit heinous  crimes  in this District of Columbia  pause. I think we ought to make them  wonder whether or not an individual  that they would harm, whether or not  they are going to harm a family or try  to rape a woman or murder someone,  give them pause, let these criminals  wonder if that individual might be able  to defend themselves.  It is important when we think that  businesses  in  this District, business  owners can have guns on the premises,  but individuals cannot have guns that  are ready to use in their homes to protect their family. All of us know that  our family members are more important to us than any material possession  that we have. We need to give individuals in the District a right to defend  themselves and we need to give these  criminals that make this the murder  capital of the world a doubt in their  mind as to whether or not someone will  be able to defend themselves.

1505,27,2004-09-29,Ms. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, let me say how much I appreciate  the Delegate from the District of Columbia for carrying on the good fight.  It is ironic that this bill proposes to  implement constitutional rights to the  District of Columbia when in fact this  body has not allowed the District of  Columbia to have a voting Member of  the United States Congress and voting  Members of the United States Senate.  This is a cruel hoax under the guise of  a constitutional amendment.  I watched some of the hearing yesterday, and it was ironic. This bill was introduced a year ago. Since it was introduced, I thought it had gone to the  mortuary and that rigor mortis had actually set in on it, and I was applauding it. But then I found out yesterday  that  it was  just  in a calling period  where people could come by the pew,  sign the book until you got over 200  signatures on the book, and then you  get it out.  This bill also came out after this  House celebrated the  life of Ronald  Reagan who was shot in this city, the  District of Columbia. And I apologize  to Mr. Brady who  is still paralyzed  from a bullet shot in this District. The  President said he wants more minorities to join the party of Lincoln because he was the Great Emancipator.  Lest we forget, Abraham Lincoln was  assassinated, too, by a bullet. He was a  Republican. Garfield was a Republican.  He was assassinated.  We are so patronizing. We know what  is best for the District of Columbia.  The chief of police said they do not  want the bill. The Mayor says he does  not want the bill. The council does not  want the bill. The newspapers had an  editorial against the bill, and we are  going to impose this anyway.  As we speak today, we are memorializing a police officer who came from  the gentleman’s district, Fort Wayne,  Indianapolis, and was killed last week  by a bullet. A month before that, we  memorialized  another  police  officer  that was killed by a bullet, and I bet  nobody on this bill ever visited one of  the families of the grandmothers that  were killed in this District.  This bill is one of the worst pieces of  legislation that I have seen as a Member of this House, and I apologize to  the grieving families for it.  b1330  ",2004
1506,27,2004-09-29,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  One would think that the District of  Columbia has a good  record  rather  than eight times the national average,  leading the Nation 14 of the past 15  years in the murder rate. As a former  mayor said, ‘‘Other than the killings,  their  crime  rate  is not  too  bad.’’  ‘‘Other than the killings’’ is a relevant  thing here. We are trying to make sure  honest citizens can protect themselves,  not just the criminals.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. CARTER), a member of the Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human  Resources Subcommittee, and a former  judge.  ",2004
1507,27,2004-09-29,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of this bill. I want to tell some  stories. For 20 years, I tried cases. I  tried  felony criminal cases, drive-by  shootings and other things which are  the kind of stuff we read in the newspapers in D.C. every day, and I can say  that the weapons that were used were  acquired  illegally and  illegitimately,  and  the  bad  guys  always had  the  chance to get their hands on guns. But  the good guys that have guns deter  crime.  We passed a right-to-carry permit in  Texas after a deranged person walked  into a Luby’s Cafeteria in Texas and  just began randomly shooting the diners in a crowded Luby’s Cafeteria. As a  result of that right-to-carry permit,  which enhanced our laws in Texas, the  amount of violent crime has fallen off  about 40 percent with the use of handguns. And what is interesting, if that  same person were to walk into a Luby’s  Cafeteria today, he would not know  whether or not there might be anywhere from two to 15 armed persons in  that place who could return fire, and it  would deter him from doing so. And  that is a proven fact.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:21 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29SE7.060 H29PT1 ",2004
1508,34,2004-09-29,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  two  weeks ago this House blocked consideration  of legislation sponsored by my colleague from  New York, Mrs. MCCARTHY, to extend the ban  on the manufacture, transfer, or possession of  semiautomatic assault weapons. The assault  weapons ban is supported by the International  Brotherhood of Police Officers, National Association  of  Police Organizations,  American  Nurses Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Public Health Association,  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  Urban  League,  National  Education  Association,  United Federation of Teachers, Children’s Defense Fund, NAACP, Anti-Defamation League,  and  the National Coalition Against Domestic  Violence.  The House  instead  today, voted  to enact  legislation which was introduced by a member  from Indiana to get rid of the ban on firearms  in the District of Columbia, against the wishes  of elected Mayor, City Council, and U.S. Delegate to Congress. Federal courts have upheld  the constitutionality of the DC ban.  These actions by  this distinguished body  distress me greatly because it was just a day  ago that a 4-year-old boy was shot to death  and a 7-year-old boy was injured in a shooting  Monday night at the Kirwan Terrace housing  community on St. Thomas in my District.  This heinous act has outraged my community which is seeking any and all assistance to  prevent  this kind of despicable crime, which  apparently was perpetrated through the use of  a high-powered  firearm,  from ever occurring  again.  Mr. Speaker, gun violence is reaching epidemic proportions  in all of our communities  and this body should be doing all we can to  reduce the number of guns that are available,  not increasing them. I urge all my colleagues  to support the Meehan discharge petition, H.  Res. 769, to allow a vote on Representative  CAROLYNMCCARTHY’s Assault Weapons Ban  and Law Enforcement Protection Act, H.R.  2038.  We have a responsibility as leaders of our  communities to do all that we can to keep our  citizens safe from the ravages of crime—particularly gun violence, such as what tragically  befell four year old Leon Bowery. May he rest  in peace.  ",2004
1509,34,2004-09-29,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong opposition to this legislation.  Nearly  thirty  years ago, handguns were  banned in Washington, D.C. by the will of the  people.

If  they oppose this motion to recommit,  they will deny many of America’s veterans access to VA health care, which  ought to be their right. This motion  would provide an additional $2.5 billion  above the President’s request to help  cut waiting lists, renovate crumbling  VA facilities and ensure timely quality  health care for America’s veterans.  The FBI is the Nation’s lead agency  for domestic counterterrorism, yet it is  the only component of our national security apparatus that will not have its  funding for fiscal year 2005 in place.  The motion would ensure that the FBI  gets its funding now, not later.  Failure to pass this motion to recommit would also shut down the Terrorist  Threat Integration Center and the Terrorist Screening Center. Neither  received funding in last year’s spending  bill, so neither would have their funding extended by the continuing resolution without this motion.  The motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, would also eliminate the nearly $1  billion in special student loan subsidies  being paid to lenders that instead could  be put to better use by helping students and families afford a college education. This House passed that amendment earlier this month on the Labor-  HHS bill  in the  form of the Kildee  amendment.  Also, Mr. Speaker,  failure to pass  this motion to recommit would deny  health  insurance  to  750,000  children  who could be covered under the State  Children’s Health Insurance Program,  or SCHIP. Currently  $1.1 billion of  SCHIP funds are available to States to  provide health insurance to children.  These  funds were accumulated while  the SCHIP programs were just being  organized, but  current  law  requires  that these  funds be returned to the  Treasury if they are not used by October 1. With more than 8 million children lacking health coverage, it makes  sense to give States more time to use  these funds and enroll children in the  SCHIP programs. We ought not be robbing these funds from children’s health  insurance programs because of an arbitrary deadline.  We also by this motion would provide  additional  funding  for education and  health care programs  funded by the  Labor-HHS-Education bill. We ask that  in  each  case  in  the  education and  health area that this bill be adjusted to  reflect the higher of the numbers between the House and the Senate bill.  The result of that, for instance, would  be to add $367 million to NIH to maintain momentum in research on diseases  like cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s,  et cetera. We also would try to deal  with the section 7 small business loan  program that was dealt with by this  House on a  similar motion  several  weeks ago.  Mr. Speaker, I would urge support for  the motion to recommit.  ",2004

1523,48,2004-09-29,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  this motion  to  recommit  actually  would be an appropriations bill. The  continuing resolution merely extends  existing  appropriations. All  of  the  issues in this motion are in the process  of being considered on regular appropriations bills.  b1545  For example,  I would  remind  the  Members that we had the issue of the  military housing cap in our appropriations bill that our committee strongly  supported; but on a point of order  raised by the Committee on the Budget, we lost that section of the military  construction bill. But as we produce  the military construction bill in conference, that provision will be in there.  The other issues in this motion are  VA medical, children’s health, higher  education; all of these issues are being  addressed as we address the balance of  the appropriations bills.  So this motion to recommit,  if  it  were successful, and I hope it will not  be, would actually turn this into an appropriations bill that would likely require conferencing and probably would  not be concluded by midnight tomorrow night, just because of the amount  of time it takes to conference a bill  and go to the other body and then  come back here  for conference, and  then to appoint the conferees. We are  running a deadline as of midnight tomorrow night.  So I would hope that while all of  these are very important issues in this  motion, and, frankly, I am supportive  of all of the issues that the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) would have  in this motion to instruct, this is not  the place to do it. This is a continuing  resolution that has to be on the President’s desk and signed before midnight  tomorrow night. We just really do not  have the time to deal with these issues  on this bill. We will deal with all of  those issues on the other bills that will  be working through the Congress in the  next few weeks.  So, Mr. Speaker, having said that,  basically all I can say is that I would  urge the Members to oppose this motion and to get on with the passage of  the continuing resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  FOLEY). Without objection,  the previous question is ordered on the motion  to recommit.  There was no objection.

Mr.  Speaker, I rise in very strong support  of H.R. 4231, as amended, the Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act of 2004. I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Health,  my  friend and colleague,  for  introducing this legislation, and for his astute judgment and perseverance that  was essential in bringing this bill before the House today. I also want to  thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  as well  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. EVANS),  because,  again, that partnership is so important  in bringing these veterans bills to the  floor; and I want to thank them for  their leadership as well.  As amended, H.R. 4231 would authorize  several new and  innovative approaches to help the VA maintain the  quality of  its workforce  in all VA  health care facilities. The bill would  establish a pilot program to use outside recruitment agencies with interactive and online technologies to improve VA recruitment of vital nursing  RODRIGUEZ),  personnel. It would also allow the VA  to offer three alternative work schedules for nurses so that employment in  VA can be more sensitive to family and  personal needs  for  scheduling  flexibility and career development.  It also contains a provision to aid  State veterans homes which care for  thousands of veterans in need of nursing home care each and every year.  One measure in the bill as reported  deserves a moment of discussion, because it caused some concern for members of the committee and organizations whose members might be affected. As reported, the bill would have  prohibited VA from denying employment  to a State-licensed  registered  nurse whose educational preparation  was other than a baccalaureate degree.  There is a well-documented shortage,  Mr. Speaker,  of  trained,  registered  nurses in the United States. Community  colleges  in  every State  have  stepped  forward to offer professional  nursing careers through associate degree preparation. Their success in preparing their students is reflected in the  rate at which associate degreed nurses  pass required State registered nurse examinations.  Associate degree nurses are systematically and vigorously recruited in almost every health care institution in  the United States. In the VA, there is  a preference  in hiring baccalaureate  graduates and a policy of excluding associate degree nurses from internal VA  promotions. At a time when nurses are  in short supply and when community  colleges are the primary source of new  nursing graduates, should the VA be  emphasizing baccalaureate degrees to  the exclusion of others who are fully  qualified as professional nurses? We  think not.  The  committee  is  concerned  that  these current VA hiring practices and  the variation in these practices noted  in the recent report of the VA’s National Commission on VA Nursing discouraged nurses with associate degrees  from even  seeking VA employment.  VA’s practice of exclusion in the face  of high demand and scarcity of nursing  personnel discourages qualified nurses  from  seeking VA employment. This  practice also adversely affects VA’s  ability to retain current nurses.  Following extensive discussions after  this bill was ordered reported, the bill  before the House today does not include section 4 of the bill as ordered reported. Section 4 was designed to keep  the VA competitive with the private  sector and to clarify that the lack of a  baccalaureate degree could not be the  basis to deny nurse employment in a  VA facility. However, the aim of the  provision was misread by some who believe that the best qualified nurses are  those who have a bachelor’s degree or  some advanced degree in nursing.  Most of us who seek health care look  to providers who are competent, compassionate,  critical  thinkers,  good  communicators, and who are dedicated  to expanding their knowledge of human  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:26 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A29SE7.086 H29PT1 ",2004
1529,69,2004-09-29,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the  life of William ‘‘Count’’ Basie and his  influence on  jazz and  swing music.  Born in Red Bank, New Jersey, Count  Basie began to learn the piano under  his mother’s  direction.  In  1924, he  moved to New York City to perfect his  talent and begin his remarkable career.  Throughout the years, he developed  and advanced his own music style. In  1935, Count Basie formed his own nine-  piece  group  called  the  Barons  of  Rhythm. The Barons of Rhythm’s style  was a powerful one. This earned Basie  the nickname ‘‘Count.’’ By the end of  the 1930s, the band was one of the most  popular in the world, with hits like  ‘‘One O’clock Jump’’ and ‘‘Jumpin’ At  the Woodside.’’  Count Basie continued to share his  talent with  the world  through  the  1970s. In 1985, one year after his death,  President Reagan  awarded him  the  Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1996,  the U.S. Post Office honored him with  a commemorative stamp.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we honor the  100th anniversary of the birth of Count  Basie and acknowledge the tremendous  impact he had on music. I congratulate  our colleague, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004

1532,69,2004-09-29,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague, the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. WOOLSEY), for yielding  me this time and for her role in bringing this resolution up on the suspension list today.  It is with distinct honor and pleasure  that I stand before this Chamber today  to speak in support of House Resolution 778. Count Basie was born in my  district and spent the first 20 years or  so of his life in my district, and I would  like to kind of recount some of the  events that occurred  in my district  during those early years.  This bill recognizes and celebrates  the incredible contribution that William ‘‘Count’’ Basie has made to jazz  and swing music. Furthermore, it is  only fitting we acknowledge his pivotal  role this year, marking the 100th anniversary of his birth.  He was born, as was stated previously  by my colleagues, on August 21, 1904, in  his parents’ home on Mechanic Streets  in Red Bank, New Jersey, which has  been in my district the entire time I  have been in Congress, and even prior  to the time I represented the area. And  Count Basie is highly regarded in our  area, as well as obviously nationally,  as one of the best and most influential  musicians and composers of the last  century.  The city of Red Bank, where he was  born, gave the young William Basie his  first exposure to music and the title of  one of the most famous tunes associated with his band, ‘‘The Kid From Red  Bank’’; and it is evidence the city of  Red Bank has had on his early musical  development.  As a child, Basie would do chores at  the Palace Theater  in Red Bank so  that he could get in free. One day when  the Palace’s house piano player was  unable to travel from New York, Basie  offered to fill in for him, but the manager declined the offer. Basie simply  waited until the picture had started,  then snuck  into the pit and accompanied the film anyway on the piano.  He was  invited  back  to  play  the  evening show.  Years  later, Basie would trace his  lifelong interest in the organ to his experiences at the Lyric Theater, another  theater  in Red Bank, New Jersey,  where he would  listen to the organ  played by Henry La Ross.  Many are surprised to learn that William Basie’s  first  love was not the  piano, but rather the drums. However,  his aspiration went towards a different  direction when he met Sonny Greer, a  young talented drummer from nearby  Long Branch, New Jersey, which is actually my hometown. The young men  quickly realized where their true respective talents really  laid, and the  drums and piano duo went on to win  first place in an Asbury Park piano  competition, one of the first of many  honors bestowed upon Basie throughout his career.  Asbury Park is also in my district,  Mr. Speaker, and  some of my colleagues know that Asbury Park was  made  famous  also  by  Bruce  Springstein, another one of our constituents.  b1815  Count Basie was awarded with a total  of nine Grammys throughout his career, including the Grammy Trustees  Award from the National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences in 1981. In  addition, he was the recipient of an  American Jazz Masters Award from the  National Endowment of the Arts  in  1983, and in 1996, he was bestowed the  honor of a Commemorative Stamp by  the United States Postal Office. And I  assure Members myself and many others in my district have lots of those  stamps.  Today, the Count Basie Theater in  Red Bank, New Jersey stands as a testament to the life, career and accomplishments of this innovative and ingenious musician. In 1984, the historic  theater, which first opened its doors in  1926, was  renamed  to honor Count  Basie. Much of the theater has been  preserved and remains true to its original appearance. The theater  is now  owned and operated by Count Basie  Theater, Inc., a nonprofit corporation  formed solely to operate the theater  for the benefit of the community, and  one cannot help but think this is exactly how the ‘‘Kid from Red Bank’’  would have liked it.  Mr. Speaker, once again I ask my  colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and pay tribute to the life and  career of an individual who revolutionized the face of jazz music and to this  day stands as a model for all those who  have followed him.

1535,69,2004-09-29,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of  William ‘‘Count’’ Basie, one of the leading figures of the swing era in jazz. Bandleader of  the renowned Count Basie Orchestra, Basie  was integral in establishing swing as the popular music of subsequent generations. His orchestra was a unique band during a unique  time  in  the history of  jazz and American  music.  Born in Red Bank, New Jersey on August  24, 1904, William ‘‘Count’’ Basie took an interest in music at an early age. He honed his  skills on both  the piano and drums  in  local  theatres in Red Bank before moving to New  York in 1924, at the age of twenty. It was in  New York where he was influenced by two of  the greatest early  jazz pianists, James P.  Johnson and Thomas ‘‘Fats’’ Waller. In 1927,  Basie moved to Kansas City, Missouri to capitalize on  its nascent  jazz scene. He  first  joined the Blue Devils Band, but soon after he  became a member of the famed Benny Moten  Orchestra. Basie later took over as bandleader  of Moten’s orchestra, which was renamed the  Count Basie Orchestra.  In 1937, Basie and his orchestra moved to  New York City and established  their home  base in Harlem, where they became one of  the leading big bands of the era. Basie’s orchestra was best known for its unique ‘‘Kansas City Sound,’’ exemplified  in such works  as,  ‘‘One O’clock Jump’’ and  ‘‘Swingin’  the  Blues.’’  Throughout his career,  ‘‘Count’’ Basie  received nine Grammy awards as well as a  Grammy Trustee award in 1981; he was also  posthumously recognized for lifetime achievement in 2002. William ‘‘Count’’ Basie was an  extremely  talented and ambitious musician  and bandleader; his  influence has persisted  throughout  time and among many different  generations. He made many  important contributions to swing, jazz, and American music.  Let us honor  this great musician and man  today. Central New Jerseyans are proud  to  say ‘‘such as he came from among us.’’  Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in support of H. Res. 778, a resolution to commemorate the 100th anniversary of  the birth of William  ‘‘Count’’ Basie, one of  America’s premier swing musicians who rose  to national prominence as a jazz pioneer while  playing at the Club Reno in Kansas City.  Born an only child on August 21, 1904 in  Red Bank, New Jersey, Basie moved to Harlem in 1920 to pursue a career in jazz music.  An aspiring pianist, he soon met Thomas  ‘‘Fats’’ Waller and developed a style of piano  VerDate Aug 04 2004  04:26 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K29SE7.126 H29PT1 ",2004

1543,83,2004-09-29,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) is  recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2004
1544,83,2004-09-29,Mr. OSBORNE.," Mr. Speaker,  this  past weekend, several of my colleagues  and I  journeyed to Baghdad and returned, and I would just like to make a  few observations. Obviously, this is a  very intense time in Iraq as the elections approaches, but I had three observations that I think were somewhat  meaningful.  Number one, we were tremendously  impressed by the morale and the attitude of our soldiers. One would say,  well, how in the world could that be? It  is  110,  115 degrees every day, body  armor, helmets, very difficult work,  some  danger,  considerable  distance  from family. I guess the main reason  that we felt we were observing this was  there seemed to be a very strong sense  of mission, a very strong sense of purpose and accomplishment.  One thing that I often heard from the  soldiers was this: they said, you know,  it seems like there are two wars over  here. There is the one that we see on  CNN: we see the IEDs, individual explosive devices; we see the car bombs; we  see the beheadings.  But the part of the story that we  think is meaningful is not being told.  They said, the thing that we see is that  in education, 2,500 schools have been  renovated, 30,000 teachers have been  trained, there is an 80 percent increase  in attendance in schools, and most of  that is girls who have not been going  to school at all under Saddam Hussein.  Health care, 240 hospitals operating,  1,000 clinics, 90 percent of the children  are  currently  vaccinated,  and  this  again is something that had not occurred before.  So health care has improved. Infrastructure is getting better. Water supply, power, sewage. It still needs improvement, but it is doing better, and  of course the provisional government  and the June 30 hand-off. So what they  were saying is please make sure the  people in the United States understand  that there is more going on than what  many times they are hearing about.  The second thing that I thought was  somewhat optimistic is that the Iraqis  are providing more and more security.  The goal  is  to  train  270,000  Iraqis;  135,000 police; 100,000 Army and National Guard; and then 32,000 border  guards. Right now we are a little bit  more than halfway there. We are making excellent progress.  So  in Najef, not  long ago,  Iraqi  troops led the charge and, along with  Ayatola Sustani, calmed a very dangerous situation. So we see progressively more and more operations with  Iraqis taking the lead.  The third thing that I would say that  was very encouraging to me is that in  talking to the Iraqis, they very much  want the elections. If the Iraqis do not  care or if they do not want elections,  then obviously the whole thing that we  are doing is for naught. I talked to an  Iraqi woman today and I asked her, I  said, are the Iraqis willing to line up  and take the risk on Election Day, and  she said, without question we will have  a tremendous turnout.  So Prime Minister Allawi told us last  week, and this was confirmed on our  trip, that roughly 15 out of 18 provinces  are sufficiently secure right now to  maintain elections, and the other two  or three are coming around. Splinter  groups who have been primarily terrorist-oriented in the past are now becoming politically active. They are beginning to realize that if they do not  become part of the political process,  they are going to be left out. So a lot  of things are changing very rapidly.  Iraqi women will tell you this, that  they see their future as being much  brighter. So when there is hope, I think  there is a good chance.  So if we pull out, as many are currently advising, we will tell the families of the 1,000 soldiers we have lost  that they have died in vain, and I do  not think we can afford to do that. Secondly, we will have broken our promise  to the Iraqis. We have told them that  we will absolutely not do that, and  many of them have trusted us. So if we  pull out now, literally tens of thousands of Iraqis are going to lose their  lives and will be sacrificed because of  our duplicity.  Thirdly, I think if we show vulnerability as a Nation; and if we show that  we do not have resolve and that we will  not see something through, and if terrorists can steer our agenda here, we  become more and more vulnerable to  terrorist activities. So I do not think  that we can afford to do this.  So at this point, as I see it, and I  think some of those who were on the  trip would also say that the only viable  exit strategy is to win. When we say to  win, we mean that we will stay the  course until the Iraqis themselves are  able to secure their country and be  able to govern their country. This is  not going to be easy, but we think it is  doable. We were encouraged by what  we saw.  f  ",2004

1549,83,2004-09-29,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Bush  administration  loves  to  tout  George W. Bush’s willingness to stay  the course as the source of his strength  as a President. Day after day,  the  President and his surrogates use this  ‘‘resolve’’  to  demonstrate  why  he  should be reelected.  The  sad  truth  is  that President  Bush’s resolve amounts to little more  than a campaign tool to disguise the  fact that his administration’s policies  have increasingly made Americans far  less safe in the world. The President’s  resolve is actually nothing more than  his attempt to lead our Nation while  wearing blinders.  President Bush failed to demonstrate  resolve  in  fighting terrorism  in the  days before the September 11 terrorist  attack. In fact, he vacationed at his  ranch in Crawford, Texas, for the entire month of August in the year 2001,  neglecting to act on his daily intelligence  briefings which  specifically  warned  against  terrorists  crashing  planes into large city buildings.  Since September 11, President Bush  has continued to fail in his resolve to  fight international terrorism. Despite a  promise  to  apprehend  Osama  bin  Laden, dead or alive, President Bush  actually pulled troops out of Afghanistan in the year 2002.

Next, I would like to yield to the gentlewoman  from  New  York  (Mrs.  LOWEY), another member of the House  Select Committee on Homeland Security, a lady who has shown not only  leadership on our committee on behalf  of homeland security but great leadership on the House Committee on Appropriations. She has also worked vigorously to protect her State from the  threat of terrorism, the great State of  New York. So it is a pleasure to yield  to her.  ",2004
1551,97,2004-09-29,Mrs. LOWEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  want to thank my good friend from  Texas for his leadership on this committee. He worked so hard and helped  us put together a really outstanding  plan. It is unfortunate that because of  various  interactivities of the Republican leadership that we have not been  able to take this plan to the finish line,  but I personally want to thank him for  his important contributions in helping  us work towards a plan that would help  keep America safe. So I thank him so  very much for his important leadership.  Mr. Speaker,  it really amazes me  that more than 3 years after September  11, we are still talking about gaps in  our  Nation’s  strategy  to  protect  against and prepare for another terrorist attack.  Several of my colleagues from the  Select Committee on Homeland Security have already highlighted ways in  which we can improve port and rail security; how can we better prepare public health communities to deal with a  biological attack; and how to protect  and secure our borders. We all agree  that more needs to be done and must  be done and that Congress should not  go home without addressing each of  these critical issues.  In my judgment, this administration  and this Congress need to beef up their  efforts to provide for first responders.  Local police, firefighters, EMS technicians  need  information. They  need  training. They need  the  life-saving  equipment necessary to protect them  from the dangers they face every day.  I was appalled when I read in yesterday’s New York Times that more than  120,000 hours of potentially valuable  terrorism-related  recordings had not  yet been translated by linguists at the  FBI. This is outrageous and particularly dangerous, especially for the residents of my home State of New York,  which is referenced in intelligence reports time and time again.  How can we expect first responders to  be able to adequately prepare for an attack when  the Federal Government  does not even have the capability to  analyze and share with them the intelligence information it has collected?  We can and we must do better.  As I travel throughout my district  and speak with first responders, like  Chief John Kapica from the town of  Greenburgh, Chief Robert Breen from  the town of New Castle, Chief Robert  D’Angelo from the town of North Castle and all the other chiefs with whom  I have been working closely, they all  tell me that implementing an interoperable  communications  system  is  one of their highest priorities and that  they have not received nearly enough  guidance,  support  or  resources  to  achieve this goal.

1552,111,2004-09-29,Mr.  INSLEE.," Madam Speaker, the  sixth question: Was the President right  or wrong when he told Americans that,  after the mission was accomplished and  the President made his grandiose landing on the aircraft carrier in full regalia with the wonderful flight suit and  helmet on, and stood in front of a banner that said ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’  and led Americans to believe it was  going to be a decreased violent situation, was he right or wrong? And let me  suggest that it was 800 lost American  heroes ago. He was wrong sadly.  But the problem with this is this is a  repeated circumstance with this administration. The administration said  that after the Iraqi Army collapsed,  things would  get  better. They  got  worse. The President said that when we  had the turnover, the purported turnover to a provisional Iraqi government,  things would get better. They have gotten worse. We are having an accelerated loss of men and women since the  turnover.  The President says after the election,  things will get better. The President  simply has been wrong time and time  again with his rose-colored glasses and  not facing the truth of the situation in  Iraq.  The seventh question: Was the President right or wrong when he decided  that the way he was going to do the reconstruction of Iraq was not to hire  Iraqis, not to hire Iraqi personnel to do  the work, not to hire poor Iraqis which  he might get off the street and reduce  unemployment, but  instead give the  contracts to his friends at Halliburton  so Halliburton could hire people from  the Philippines with  our  taxpayer  money? He was wrong in giving the  money to Halliburton and the reason  he was wrong is we know that every  employed Iraqi is one less potential recruit for the insurgency, and we have  been wasting billions of American taxpayer dollars, not using it effectively  in the reconstruction of Iraq.  Madam Speaker, my final question,  my eighth question is: Was the President right or wrong in saying now that  we have done enough, at a proper rate  of  training  the new  Iraqi  security  force, was he right or wrong?  I am going to give Members one tidbit that I read today. Today, a year and  a half after the invasion, this administration still has less than 40 percent of  the infrastructure for the military necessary to train the Iraqi Army. So here  we are with our GIs in harm’s way and  a year and a half later this administration has less than half of the people  they need to do the training of the  Iraqi Army, and they expect to have an  election in 3 months.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  DELAHUNT).  ",2004
1553,111,2004-09-29,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Madam Speaker,  here we are again late at night asking  questions.  Madam Speaker, it is a rare commodity, unfortunately, in Washington,  D.C., when one speaks of courage. We  witness courage all over America. We  witness courage in terms of our men  and women overseas risking their lives.  We observe courage every day in our  streets, particularly with our public  safety officials. We clearly witnessed  an extraordinary level of courage and  heroism on September 11, but we seem  to have a paucity of political courage  because I believe and I think that most  Americans share the view that political courage  involves admitting that  you are wrong when it is clear that you  have made a mistake.  Madam Speaker, all of the questions  that the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. INSLEE) posed to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. STRICKLAND) elicited an  obvious answer, that the President was  wrong.  b2330  But what I find most disturbing is  the inability of this President to summon the political courage to acknowledge that he was wrong. It is certainly  no disgrace to make a mistake, to be  wrong. We have all done it. I do it  every day. But what I think is particularly un-American, undemocratic, is a  reluctance to be forthright and honest  about your failures. We do not hear  that from this President. That is sad.  Because that kind of courage would be  the earmark of genuine leadership, of  leadership that would be embraced by  all of us, irrespective of partisan differences. But it is so sorely lacking at  this moment in our history.  We need a leader with political courage. I think it became clear to me last  March when David Kay, the man who  led this White House postwar effort to  find the weapons of mass destruction  that were purportedly in Iraq, called on  the President to come clean with the  American people. I think when he made  that call, he felt that the President  was receiving poor political advice and  that what was necessary was to acknowledge that a mistake had been  made. I know that the two of you remember his appearance before a committee in the other branch that appeared on the front page of, I think it  was Time magazine, but  it was eloquent in its courage when he said, ‘‘We  were all wrong.’’ It is not a sin to be  wrong, but it is not being patriotic and  American to lack the courage to admit  a mistake was made.  David Kay said, and I am quoting  from a  story  that appeared  in  the  Guardian, a highly respected English  magazine. He said that the administration’s reluctance to make that admission was undermining its credibility at  home and abroad. He called for a frank  admission, even though it was embarrassing.  Not only are we losing our prestige,  not only are we losing our claim to  moral authority but because of this  President’s  failure to admit he was  wrong, let me suggest we are losing the  war on terror, because we are losing allies every day and the American people  should know that. Because when you  review the hard evidence that shows  that incidents of terror are increasing  dramatically every day all over the  world, particularly in Iraq and in Afghanistan, I fear that we are losing  that war, a war that every American  wants to win. I thank the gentleman  from Washington for enumerating that  list of mistakes. But I could even forgive this President if he could accept  responsibility, but he cannot. That is a  failure of courage.  ",2004
1554,111,2004-09-29,Mr. INSLEE.," I think the ninth question dovetails with what you are saying so eloquently that all of us can  make mistakes. It is human. And these  are difficult situations, obviously. But  my ninth question, I think, goes to an  issue that exposes why we are in such  a difficult situation in Iraq. The ninth  question is, Is the President right or  wrong when he tells us, or leads us to  believe  that most  of  this  violence  against Americans in Iraq are outside  forces of Iraq, sort of these outside terrorists who are coming into Iraq to  commit  this  horrendous  violence  against us? The reason he has said this,  I think, is he wants to believe that because he does not want to believe that  the Iraqis themselves do not view us as  liberators, because he always believed  that apparently we would be greeted as  liberators. He apparently cannot get  out of that mind-set that some Iraqis  view us as occupiers.  So was the President right or wrong  when he says that most of the violence  against Americans is caused by people  from outside of Iraq? The President is  wrong. The reason I know that is they  finally did an evaluation of the people  in custody in our prisons, Abu Ghraib  where we obviously had a lack of leadership as far up as the Secretary of Defense; but what they found was of all  the people we had in custody, less than  2 percent were from outside of Iraq.  Less than one out of 50 of these people  that we had in custody were from outside Iraq.  What does that tell you? That is bad  news for us, because what it means is  that 49 out of 50 of those people are  Iraqis who are fighting, who are domestic and who  live there. That means  that the President’s working assumption from day one that we would be  seen as  liberators simply  is not the  case, and he refuses to recognize that  reality.  ",2004
1555,111,2004-09-29,Mr. STRICKLAND.," On this question,  this ninth question, I think the President is partly right.

1556,146,2004-09-29,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Maine.  ,2004
1557,146,2004-09-29,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I certainly understand the  intent of the  Senator from Pennsylvania in offering  this amendment. Indeed, he offered it  during  the markup  of  the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was debated at length.  Initially, in considering this issue, I,  too, was inclined to believe that the  new  national  intelligence  director  should have some sort of term of office.  However,  the  testimony we  heard  through our eight hearings changed my  mind in this regard.  Under our  legislation, S. 2845, the  NID serves as the principal adviser to  the President. The individual not only  manages the  intelligence community  and heads up the new national intelligence authority, but serves as the  principal adviser to the President. I am  stressing that role because I believe  that is key to why the director, in fact,  should not have a fixed term. It is essential that the NID enjoy the full confidence and trust of the President of  the United States. That was a point  made by the 9/11 Commission chairman, Tom Kean, at our very first hearing on July 30. But we heard that repeated  time and again by our witnesses. All of the  former DCIs who  came  before  the  committee,  representing a variety of times and administrations, were unanimous  in  their  view that the new NID should serve at  the pleasure of the President.  The then Acting Director of the CIA  John McLaughlin made the point at  our September 8 hearing that for the  NID to successfully clarify our assignment of serving as the principal adviser  to the President, he must enjoy the  President’s trust and confidence.  Consider a situation where the Presidency changes parties during that 10-  year-period. It would be very awkward  for a new President of a different party  to inherit the national intelligence director from the previous administration. Their world views and philosophy  may have nothing in common. Yet the  President has to have a close and trusting relationship with the national intelligence  director.  The  President  should be able to choose his or her own  person for that critical post.  Proponents of having a 10-year term  have frequently compared this proposal  to the 10-year term of the Director of  the FBI. I would note that I asked Director Mueller whether he thought the  new NID should have a 10-year term  similar to his. He said he did not think  a 10-year term or any fixed term was  appropriate  for  the  national  intelligence director. He said the role of the  FBI Director is very different from the  role of the national intelligence director.  Over and over again during our hearings, Senator LIEBERMANand I raised  this question with the witnesses because we, too, were trying to reach the  right determination. Over and over  again, the advice was the same, whether it was the 9/11 Commission, the Acting Director of the CIA, the former Directors of the CIA, or Director Mueller  of the FBI. Over and over again, they  advised against setting a term.  So we need to create a position where  the individual will enjoy the full confidence and trust of the President of  the United States. That is the only way  that  individual can effectively carry  out the role he is assigned in this legislation to serve as the President’s principal intelligence adviser.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment of  the Senator from Pennsylvania.  ",2004

1559,146,2004-09-29,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  also rise to oppose this amendment by  the Senator from Pennsylvania. This  is, as Senator COLLINShas indicated, a  matter we discussed in what I thought  was a very thoughtful discussion in our  committee deliberation on a similar  amendment.  There are good arguments on both  sides. The objective here is to balance  the independence we want our national  intelligence director to have with the  importance of having a trusting relationship with  the President of  the  United States. In the end, I concluded  it would be wrong to give a fixed term  to the national  intelligence director  for the reason to which I just heard  Senator COLLINSrefer.  Remember, we have given the national intelligence director two main  responsibilities. One is to administer  the intelligence community. The other  is to be the principal intelligence adviser to the President of the United  States. In fact, one could argue, although the national intelligence director as administrator has many customers, if you will, for intelligence, the  No. 1 customer is the President of the  United States as President and certainly as Commander in Chief. So that  is a relationship that must be a trusting relationship.  The  danger  is  that  an  incoming  President will be given  someone  in  whom he does not have that kind of  confidence. Unfortunately, history—recent history—gives us an example of  that, without attributing blame. President Clinton and then-Director of the  FBI, Mr. Freeh, had a relationship that  was  not mutually  confident,  and,  therefore, he had somebody  in that  critical position who had very  little  contact with  the President  of  the  United States. He was Director of the  FBI, not the principal personal intelligence adviser in the sense of giving  advice personally to the President of  the United States.  The concern about the independence  of the national intelligence adviser is  an important one. I feel very strongly  that in this bill Senator COLLINSand I  offer, and our committee offers to the  Senate, we have done a lot to protect  the independence of the national intelligence director.

1562,167,2004-09-29,Mr. MCCAIN.," That clears up the parliamentary situation.  I thank my friend from Montana. I  know how involved he has been on this  issue. I was referring back to a hearing  we had in 1997 on this issue. I do thank  him. This compromise is certainly not  what he wanted and it is not what I  wanted. I also thank Senator LOTT for  his good offices in helping, as well as  the cooperation of the staffs, as well as  that of Senator HOLLINGSand his staff.  Again, this  is not what I wanted.  This is not what Senator BURNSwanted. But this is a way to achieve the primary recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which is to free up spectrum  for first responders.  I will not quote again because I do  not have it right here, but it is important we get this spectrum to our public  safety and first responders so they will  be able to communicate in case of a  disaster or attack.  The compromise amendment modifies my proposal by eliminating the requirement that all broadcasters vacate  the analog spectrum by a date certain.  Significantly,  this  compromise  still  provides the certainty that public safety was seeking, that they will receive  the spectrum they were promised in  1997 by January 1, 2008.  This was not my preference on how  to proceed. I never believed in treating  broadcasters differently. However, this  amendment does so by requiring broadcasters on channels 62 through 69 to vacate their spectrum if there is a bona  fide request made by public safety. The  NAB is supporting this amendment and  has decided to treat its members differently.  This approach has been agreed to by  Senators BURNS, HOLLINGS, and myself.  Again, it was not my preference to proceed  in this discriminatory manner,  but in the interest of ensuring passage  this year, I thought this was a positive  step for public safety. However, I remind my  colleagues  this  disparate  treatment should be reviewed by the  FCC this year.  The FCC can remedy this discriminating  treatment by completing  its  work toward ending the DTV transition. I urge the FCC to do so. I also  urge the incoming chairman, Senator  STEVENS, and Chairman BARTONof the  Commerce Committee in the House to  review this discriminatory treatment  and  the  DTV  transition  upon  Congress’s return in January.  Lastly, I remind my colleagues that  this approach does not provide public  safety  the much needed money  for  equipment or consumers, a subsidy to  ensure all over-the-air viewers can continue to view television. It was not my  preference to strand public safety or  consumers in this manner. I hope in  the near term Congress will readdress  this need  to  support  public  safety  equipment  funding. I thank my colleagues.  Mr. President, I do not believe there  would be any further debate. I think  the Senator from Montana would agree  to have a voice vote.  ",2004

1573,167,2004-09-29,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator LIEBERMANI  propose an amendment that includes a  number of the national preparedness  provisions  recommended by  the  9/11  Commission and is similar to the related proposal we introduced as part of  S. 2774 on September 7. It does not address the issue of homeland security  grants or spectrum allocation, as those  issues will be addressed separately. I  believe that this amendment will be  non-controversial, and I hope that my  colleagues will support it.  One of the lessons that we learned  from  the  terrorist  attacks  of September 11  is that not only was our  country not prepared to prevent the  terrorist attacks, but we were not adequately prepared to  immediately respond to the attack. One of the fundamental lessons learned is that we need  to do more to prepare our first responders and the general public to respond to  a terrorist attack.  The stories of the New York City Police Department not being able to communicate with the New York City Fire  Department have led serious efforts to  increase the amounts of money devoted  to increasing interoperability. Lives of  the brave men and women of the fire  department and the people working at  the World Trade Center were lost during the terrorist attacks due, in part,  to a lack of communication and the  lack of a coordinated strategy to respond to large scale disasters. We must  continue to work to ensure that we  equip our  first  responders with  the  equipment and training necessary to  ensure both their safety and their ability to carry out their critical missions.  The Commission’s report emphasizes  the importance of teamwork, collaboration, cooperation, and the involvement of key decisionmakers. Their recommendations  build  upon  these  themes. The report recommends that  emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt the Incident Command System to ensure that there is a  command structure in place when responding to an emergency. This amendment expresses the Sense of Congress  that the Secretary for Homeland Security require homeland security grant  applicants aggressively implement the  ICS and unified command systems. The  amendment also would follow the Commission’s recommendation to remedy  the long-standing liability and indemnification  impediments to the provision of mutual aid in the National Capital Region.  Consistent with  the  recommendations, the amendment also would direct  the Secretary of Homeland Security to  work with  the Federal Communications Commission, the Secretary of Defense, and State and local government  officials to encourage and support the  establishment of consistent and effective  communications  capabilities  in  the event of an emergency in a high-  risk urban area. The Secretary is also  directed to work with the Secretary of  Defense  to plan  for  supplying additional back-up communications  support in the event of an emergency.  As pointed out by the 9/11 Commission, the private sector controls approximately 85 percent of the critical  infrastructure in the Nation, and the  report therefore places particular emphasis on the  importance of private  sector preparedness. The Commission  report endorses the American National  Standards  Institute, ANSI, and National Fire Protection Association,  NFPA, voluntary Standard on Disaster/  Emergency Management and Business  Continuity Programs. The amendment  would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to  promote private  sector preparedness  for terrorism and other emergencies,  including urging companies to adopt  this ANSI/NFPA standard.

He is always so good to work  with on so many issues, and we have  enjoyed working on this one as well.  I want  to  recognize  that Senator  LOTTwas also very involved in the negotiations and working with Senator  and me  to modify  this  amendment in a way to preserve the  goal of the amendment, and yet to address some concerns we had about creating a new board, unnecessary bureaucracy, or some duplication.  As I indicated when Senator WYDEN  first offered his amendment, I believe  he is addressing a very real problem,  and that is improving the way we classify and declassify documents. I know  the members of the Intelligence Committee have been very frustrated with  the process that they went through in  developing a lengthy report, only to  have so much of it redacted and to  have no good way of appealing those  redactions, no good way of challenging  what many members  of  that  committee, on both  sides of  the aisle,  viewed as excessive secrecy or excessive classification.  I have been concerned that the original amendment intruded unnecessarily  into the President’s constitutional prerogative and duplicated some of the  provisions  in our bill.  I believe the  LIEBERMAN changes we have worked out so cooperatively go a very long way toward  addressing the concerns we had while  advancing the goal.  Rather than creating a new board to  review the classification policy, Senator WYDEN’s amendment would now  ensure that Congress has an opportunity to make comments regarding  the Presidential review of classification policies already established under  the Collins-Lieberman bill, and even  more importantly to the Senator who  has said we need an independent place  for Congress to go to bring appeals regarding classification decisions, the revised amendment has agreed to build  upon a board that already exists, the  Public Interest Declassification Board.  The  amendment would  change  the  name of that board to the Independent  National Security Classification Board.  This board was established in 2001, but  it is still being put into place.  Under the Wyden amendment, it will  have specific authority to hear appeals  of classification decisions from specified  congressional  committees. The  board would then make a recommendation to the President, which the President could either accept or reject. If  the President rejects the board’s decision, then the President, as the Senator indicated, would have to send a  written justification of that decision to  Congress. This framework helped to address some of the concerns we had  about the original amendment.  I will note that this is not the administration’s  favorite amendment, even  in the revised form, but I believe we  have struck a fair balance and I am  prepared to recommend that we accept  the amendment once we get it. I understand it is going to be here momentarily. There were a  few  technical  glitches.  ",2004

1577,174,2004-09-29,Mr.  LIEBERMAN.," Mr.  President,  again, I thank Senator WYDEN. It was a  pleasure for us and our staffs to work  with him and his staff. As I said, this is  a substantial accomplishment. I particularly  enjoyed  the Senator’s  reference to the late, great Senator Pat  Moynihan. I have a vision of Pat in  Heaven smiling right now. I can see  that smile. He is probably not wearing  that hat that we all loved so much at  the time.  The important thing here is this is a  right of appeal, if you will, regarding  the President’s power to classify documents. That is a right that will exist in  a limited number of Members of Congress, interestingly and importantly, of  both  parties.  The  ultimate  beneficiaries, of course, are the American  people.  Members of Congress have access to  matters that are  fully classified. So  this  is  really  the public’s  right  to  know.

1580,202,2004-09-29,Mr.  SANTORUM.," Mr.  President,  today I am introducing along with Senator ROCKEFELLER the Fire Sprinkler  Incentive Act of 2004. Passage of this  bipartisan bill would serve to help reduce the tremendous annual economic  and human loss that fire in the United  States inflicts on our Nation.  In  the United States,  fire departments responded to approximately 1.7  million  fires  in 2002. Annually, over  500,000 of  these are  structural  fires  causing  approximately  3,400  deaths,  around 100 of which are  firefighters.  Fire also caused some 18.5 million civilian injuries and $10.3 billion in direct property loss. The indirect cost of  fire in the United States annually exceeds $80 billion. These losses are staggering. All of this translates to the fact  that fire departments respond to a fire  every 18 seconds. Every 60 seconds a  fire breaks out in a structure and in a  residential structure every 80 seconds.  There are literally thousands of high-  rise buildings built under older codes  that lack adequate fire protection. In  addition, billions of dollars were spent  to make  these and other buildings  handicapped  accessible,  but  people  with disabilities now occupying these  buildings are not adequately protected  from fire. At recent code hearings, representatives of the health care industry testified that there are approximately 4,200 nursing homes that need  to be retrofitted with fire sprinklers.  They further testified that the cost of  protecting  these buildings with  fire  sprinklers would have  to be  raised  through  corresponding  increases  in  Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to  the alarming number of nursing homes  lacking fire sprinkler protection, there  are literally thousands of assisted living facilities housing older Americans  and people with disabilities that lack  fire sprinkler protection.  The  solution  resides  in automatic  sprinkler  systems  that  are  usually  triggered within 4 minutes of the temperature rising above 120 degrees. The  National Fire Protection Association  (NFPA) has no record of a fire killing  more than two people in a public assembly, educational, institutional, or  residential building that has fully operational sprinklers. Furthermore, sprinklers are responsible for dramatically  reducing property loss.  Building owners do not argue with  fire authorities over the logic of protecting their building with fire sprinklers. The issue is cost. This bill would  drastically reduce the staggering annual economic toll of fire in America  and thereby dramatically improve the  quality of life for everyone involved.  This legislation provides a tax incentive for businesses to install sprinklers  through the use of a 5-year depreciation period, opposed to the current 27.5  or 39-year period for installations in  residential rental and non-residential  real property respectively. While only  a start, the bill will help eliminate the  massive losses seen in nursing homes,  nightclubs, office buildings, apartment  buildings,  manufacturing  facilities,  and other for-profit entities.  This bill enjoys support from a variety of organizations. They include: the  American  Insurance Association, the  American Fire Sprinkler Association,  the California Department of Forestry  and  Fire  Protection,  Campus  Firewatch, Congressional Fire Services  Institute,  Independent  Insurance  Agents & Brokers of America, International Association of Arson Investigators, International Association of  Fire Chiefs, International Fire Service  Training Association, National Fire  Protection Association, National Fire  Sprinkler Association, National Volunteer Fire Council, the Society of Fire  Protection Engineers, and the Mechanical Contractors Association of America.  The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of  2004 provides long needed safety incentives for building owners that will help  fire departments across the country  save lives. I ask my colleagues for their  support of this important piece of legislation.  ",2004
1581,202,2004-09-29,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  every  18  seconds a  fire department  somewhere in America responds to a  fire. And sadly, in 2001, not including  those killed in the terrorist attacks on  September 11, there were almost 4,000  deaths in America resulting from fires,  including the deaths of 99 firefighters.  Obviously, the Government cannot prevent every tragedy. But when we can  help, we ought to. That is why I am  proud to  introduce  legislation today  with my  friend  from Pennsylvania,  Senator SANTORUM, that will create incentives  for  the  installation of  fire  sprinkler  systems, which  are  indisputably effective in limiting death and  destruction by fires. The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2004 will make  retrofit installation of fire sprinklers  more affordable.  The National Fire Protection Association has no record of a fire killing  more than two people  in a building  that had a properly installed and functioning sprinkler system. Less important than saving lives, but still important, sprinklers can dramatically reduce the property damage caused by  fires. Because sprinkler systems are so  successful, many jurisdictions require  that newly constructed buildings be  built with proper fire suppression technology.  Unfortunately,  building  codes  for  new construction cannot protect the  many people who are living, working,  or meeting in older buildings that do  not have sprinklers. And because retrofitting buildings  is so expensive  few  property owners can reasonably afford  the upgrade. The legislation that the  Senator from Pennsylvania and I are  introducing today will provide some  tax relief to property owners who are  willing  to make  the  investment  in  sprinkler systems that can save lives.  A  business  that  operates  nursing  homes, for example, may not be able to  afford to retrofit  its older  facilities  without charging residents insupportable fees. The Fire Sprinkler Incentive  Act will help ameliorate the costs of  sprinkler installation by enabling property owners to depreciate the investment over a  five-year period. This  small change to the Tax Code can result in lives saved and property preserved.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues to get this important legislation enacted.

1589,258,2004-09-29,Ms. MAJETTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today to honor a true  patriot for his heroic courage under fire—Lieutenant Tyler Brown.  Lieutenant Brown, who was  from Atlanta,  Georgia, made the ultimate sacrifice on September 14, 2004, when he gave his  life  in  service to our country while on duty with the  United States Army in Iraq. His untimely and  unfortunate passing serves as a reminder that  freedom comes at a terrible cost, and that we  all live in a free land because so many like  Tyler have died  to protect  those cherished  freedoms.  Although Lieutenant Brown was with us but  for an all too brief time on this earth, he will  forever remain in the hearts of the family and  friends who so dearly loved him. The example  he set by his service, by his devotion, and by  his loyalty to his country will, like a beacon,  shine a ray of light through the darkness to  show the way for all those who follow in his  footsteps.  I’m confident that, by answering his nation’s  call to service, Lt. Brown understood all too  well  that he,  like so many other brave men  and women, could be thrust into harm’s way  in the pursuit of peace and liberty and the protection of freedom. These are perilous times,  and events taking place throughout the world,  even within our own borders, have sharpened  our  focus on  the grave dangers around us.  Yes, Lt. Brown understood the nature of his  service, and stepped forward proudly to represent the best that is within us. With great  admiration and respect, we honor him today.  In spite of the tears that are flowing, and the  sharp pain residing deep within us, may we be  comforted by the knowledge that Tyler is now  safely in God’s hands, that he has been welcomed home with a warm, secure and loving  embrace.  I offer my condolences  to his  family and  friends. We all share your grief; we all mourn  your loss. My prayers are with you. JOE SKEEN FEDERAL BUILDING  HON. MICHAEL BILIRAKIS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 28, 2004 ",2004
1590,258,2004-09-29,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, last week the  House approved H.R. 3734, which would designate the federal building located at Fifth and  Richardson Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico,  as the ‘‘Joe Skeen Federal Building.’’ Naming  this building after our late colleague would be  a  tremendous honor  to his memory and his  family, and I strongly support this legislation to  accomplish that goal.  Representative Skeen was a dedicated patriot who answered the call of his country by  joining the Navy and the Air Force Reserves.  He built his life on helping people, serving his  neighbors and fellow citizens in the New Mexico State Senate before being elected to the  U.S. House of Representatives as a write-in  candidate in 1980. He served in this venerable  body for 22 years, the longest-serving Member  of the House from New Mexico. He was respected by his colleagues and  loved by his  constituents  for being honest,  caring, and  hard-working.  I had the privilege of serving with Joe for 20  years in Congress, and I am proud to have  been his friend. I remember many conversations I had with Joe over the years. He spent  much of his  time on  this  floor sitting  in  the  ‘‘Florida corner,’’ delighting us with his wonderful sense of humor and thoughtful opinions.  He is greatly missed.  Mr. Speaker, Joe’s death from Parkinson’s  disease in December 2003 may have closed  the book on a life characterized by unfailing  public service, but  it did not extinguish his  memory, which lives on in the hearts of his  family, his  friends, and  the Members of  this  body. The ‘‘Joe Skeen Federal Building’’ will  stand as a testament to the great New Mexican who served his constituents and the people of the United States so tirelessly for many  decades. I thank my colleagues for honoring  Joe by approving H.R. 3734. f  HONORING THE MEMORY OF  CESAR HERNANDEZ  HON. HEATHER WILSON  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 28, 2004 Mrs. WILSON of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor  the memory of Cesar  Hernandez.  Cesar died on July 5th of this year at age  61. His contribution to New Mexico lives on.  Cesar was publisher of the Spanish language  newspaper, La Razon.  With a circulation of 17,000 copies, Cesar’s  newspaper is a major source of news and information for the substantial Spanish-speaking  population of New Mexico.  This newspaper’s importance to the population it serves is difficult to over-emphasize.  We  live  in an era of news up-to-the minute  and always available, but  to a person who  reads or understands primarily Spanish,  the  sources of information are often rare or incomplete. La Razon  fills  that gap and offers  its  readers valuable, practical information for their  day-to-day lives.  Cesar’s family will never forget the day they  became New Mexicans, because it was September 11, 2001. Cesar started his newspaper  one week later. Cesar logged decades of experience in radio and newspaper, and got his  start in Chicago, Illinois. Today, his work goes  on in New Mexico under the direction of his  wife, Antoinette, and his family.  In 3 years, Cesar contributed much to his  adopted state, New Mexico. As his daughter  Leslie put it, ‘‘My father loved the newspaper.’’  We’re proud  to recognize Cesar Hernandez,  and we honor his memory and contribution to  New Mexico. f  RECOGNIZING  THE  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WOMEN ATHLETES AT  THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPICS  HON.

1591,258,2004-09-29,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  on behalf of  the Congressional Caucus  for  Women’s  Issues and  its  leaders, Congresswomen  BROWN-WAITEand HILDAL. SOLISand myself,  to honor  the amazing achievements of  the  women athletes at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. In particular, I want to celebrate  the success of  the United States Women’s  Soccer Team, who made us proud by winning  a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics, beating  Brazil 2–1 in overtime, on August 26, 2004.  I would especially  like  to  recognize Julie  Foudy  and Brandi Chastain,  our  honored  guests for a Congressional Caucus for Women’s  Issues  reception  today, Tuesday, September 28, 2004, celebrating the accomplishments of  female U.S. Olympic athletes. As  Captain and 16-year veteran of the U.S. Women’s National Team, Julie Foudy is one of the  most influential athletes in the United States.  Through the end of 2003, she had started in  229 of the 239 games in which she appeared,  including all six of  the world championship  events played by the U.S. women. And if that  was not impressive enough, she scored in all  four of the Women’s World Cup tournaments.  Her teammate, Brandi Chastain, another longstanding player on the U.S. Women’s Soccer  Team, provided one of the greatest moments  in the history of sports with her penalty kick on  the USA’s  fifth shot  in  the 1999 Women’s  World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.  These women have become some of  the  most  famous athletic  role models on earth.  They have taught our children that if you work  hard and you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything. Indeed, these women are  helping  to  fundamentally change perceptions  about athletics. It is no surprise that our little  girls look up to these strong, motivated women  for inspiration. But to also see little boys wearing  jerseys emblazoned with  the names of  their  favorite women players  is a wonderful  sight. The accomplishments of this generation  of women athletes demonstrates the profound  impact that Title IX has had on increasing opportunities in sports for women and girls. Title  IX, part of the Education Amendments of 1972  requiring that public schools and colleges provide equal educational and athletic opportunities for girls and women, has unquestionably  been a tremendous success.

1592,265,2004-09-29,Ms. KILPATRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor one of the State of Michigan’s longest serving public officials Mr. Andrew Swiecki.  Andy was born on August 2, 1939 in the city  of Wyandotte, the forth of five children of Andrew and Sophia Swiecki. He attended school  in Wyandotte, and after graduating  from Mt.  Carmel High School he attended the University of Detroit and graduated with a degree in  Industrial Relations in 1963.  He is married to the former Pat Prosniewski,  and they are the parents of three children: Andrew Kenneth, Jeffrey Allen and Susan Nicole  Swiecki-Radel. Andy, and his wife Pat, have  three grandchildren and are expecting a fourth  grandchild in 2005.  First elected to Wyandotte’s City Council in  1967, Andy served on  the Council  for 12  years, being elected to six 2-year terms. He  was then elected Wyandotte’s City Treasurer  in 1979 and has been re-elected to that position 10 times. Andy has served the citizens of  Wyandotte for 37 years.  He is a member in good standing of many  clubs and professional organizations,  including: Wyandotte Goodfellows; Downriver YMCA  Board; Wayne County Treasurers Association;  Downriver Community Conference; Southeast  Michigan  Community  Alliance;  Municipal  Treasures USA/Canada Association; Chairman  of Wyandotte Employees Retirement  Commission;  the Polish Legion of American  Veterans; St. Stanislaus Kostka Club 30; Our  Lady of Mt. Carmel Church Ushers Club and  Holy Name Society; Polish Roman Catholic  Union; Knights of Columbus; and many others.  Andy was named Citizen of the Year by Wyandotte Service Clubs in 1990 and was honored as Volunteer of the Year by the YMCA in  2003.  As you can see Mr. Andrew Swiecki is well  deserving of our  recognition  for his many  years of service to his community. f  PLEDGE PROTECTION ACT OF 2004  SPEECHOF  HON. DENNIS MOORE  OFKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 23, 2004 The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2028) to amend  title 28, United States Code, with respect to  the jurisdiction of Federal courts inferior to  the Supreme Court over certain cases and  controversies involving the Pledge of Allegiance: ",2004
1593,265,2004-09-29,Mr. MOORE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  opposition to H.R. 2028, the Pledge Protection  Act of 2003.  The American flag is a symbol of liberty and  justice, of freedom of speech and expression,  as well as  the other  freedoms we cherish  which are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. But  even more important than the symbol are the  ideals and principles  that  the symbol  represents. I believe the best way to honor the  American flag is not to wrap ourselves in it,  but to respect and honor the values for which  it stands. That our nation can  tolerate disrespect for our flag is proof of the enduring  strength of our nation.  As a veteran who served in the U.S. Army  and Army Reserves, I know how deeply our  veterans  love and  revere our  flag.  I share  those feelings for our flag and all that it represents.  Our democracy has withstood many  tests  over time, and has been strengthened as a result. There  is no more  important protection  provided by the First Amendment than its protection of political speech and expression.  In a  letter  to Senator PATRICK of  Vermont dated May 18, 1999, now-Secretary  of State (then General) Colin L. Powell wrote,  to express his concerns regarding a constitutional amendment banning flag burning, ‘‘the  First Amendment exists to insure that freedom  of speech and expression applies not just to  that with which we agree or disagree, but also  that which we  find outrageous.  I would not  amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.’’  I agree wholeheartedly with Secretary Powell’s statement, and believe it applies here as  well. The Pledge of Allegiance is an invaluable  part of our national heritage, but we must also  bear in mind the immeasurable significance of  the First Amendment  to  the United States  Constitution.  Finally, I have deep concerns about current  efforts to deny the federal courts, including the  Supreme Court, the ability to review the constitutionality of our federal laws. I believe preserving our  three-branch system of government is in our nation’s best interest. LEAHY f  PAYING TRIBUTE TO JAMES  SULLIVAN  HON.

1594,265,2004-09-29,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  take this opportunity to pay tribute to James  Sullivan and thank him for his exceptional contributions to his community and the State of  Colorado as a Douglas County Commissioner.  A county commissioner since 1989, James is  a dedicated public servant and leader in his  community and I am honored to recognize his  accomplishments before  this body of Congress and this Nation today.  James  is  the president of  the Douglas  County Water Resource Authority, where he  dedicates his time to preserving underground  water supplies and building support  for  the  use of renewable water resources. He  is a  past president of Colorado Counties, Inc., an  active participant in the National Association of  Counties, and has served as a commissioner  on the national panel for the Joint Center for  Sustainable Communities. James is also the  first commissioner in 22 years to be placed on  the Douglas County Fair Board. Some of the  additional commissions and boards he served  on  include:  the Board of Trustees  for  the  Southeast  Business  Partnership, Colorado  Governor Bill Owens’ Commission on Saving  Open Spaces, and the E–470 Public Highway  Authority Board.  In 2002, Governor Owens appointed James  to  the Colorado Civil Rights Commission,  where he will serve a 4-year term representing  local government.  In addition,  the Governor  also appointed him to the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund Board of Directors, which  uses State  lottery proceeds  to buy and  improve  recreation areas, parks, and wildlife  habitats in Colorado.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that James Sullivan  has ceaselessly dedicated his time and efforts  to serving his country and the people of Colorado as a Douglas County Commissioner.  I  am honored to bring his hard work and commitment to the attention of this body of Congress and this Nation today. Thank you for all  your dedication and service, James.  I wish  you all the best in your future endeavors. f  INTRODUCTION  OF  RESOLUTION  COMMENDING  NATIONAL  GEOGRAPHIC BEE  2004 WINNER ANDREW WOJTANIK  HON.

1595,265,2004-09-29,Mr. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf of his  proud neighbors  in Kansas’ Third Congressional District, and particularly on behalf of the  students and  teachers at Lakewood Middle  School in Overland Park, Kansas, I am honored today to introduce a resolution congratulating Andrew Wojtanik  for winning  the 16th  Annual National Geographic Bee. I have been  joined  in  this effort by Representatives JIM  RYUNand JERRYMORANof Kansas, and by  Representatives  MAJOR OWENS,  BLUMENAUER, and MAXBURNS.  EARL  On May 26, 2004, Andrew won the 16th Annual National Geographic Bee when he correctly answered a question about the Khyber  Pass in Northern Pakistan.  While Andrew’s comprehensive knowledge  of geography is an inspiration to students everywhere, studies suggest  that most of Andrew’s peers would be unable to find Pakistan  on a map, let alone be aware of the significance of the Khyber Pass. Only 13 percent of  young adults in the United States between the  ages of 18 and 24 can correctly identify Iraq  on a map of Asia and the Middle East. Year  after year, American students are consistently  outperformed  in geographic  literacy by students  in Sweden, Germany,  Italy, France,  Japan, Great Britain, and Canada.  The  truth  is  that many  students  in  the  United States receive only a minimal amount  of  geography  education  during  their  educational careers. In 2001, Congress acknowledged the importance of including geography  education in school curriculums when it designated geography as a ‘‘core subject’’ in the  No Child Left Behind Act; yet, geography remains the only core subject identified in that  act without a federal program designed to improve educational performance.

MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO  OFGUAM  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 28, 2004 ",2004
1598,272,2004-09-29,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, since  the  end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the  island of Guam, whose residents I have the  privilege of  representing here  in Congress,  has been a territory of the United States and  a part of the American family. The Department  of the Navy administered the U.S. Territory of  Guam from the time the island was ceded to  the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris until December 8, 1941, when, during World War II, Imperial Japanese military  forces attacked,  invaded and  then occupied  Guam. The attack on Guam occurred only  hours following the December 7, 1941, Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, at  the time also a territory of the United States;  the different dates owing to the International  Date Line.  The enemy occupation of Guam lasted approximately  two-and-a-half  years,  from December 10, 1941 until July 21, 1944. The occupation was a time of tremendous hardship  for the Chamorro people, the indigenous people of Guam. The people of Guam, who were  U.S. nationals at  the  time,  remained steadfastly loyal to the United States. Residents of  the  island,  who  numbered  approximately  22,000, were subjected to forced labor, forced  marches and deprivation at the hands of an  enemy corroborating with the Axis forces. In  the weeks prior to liberation, which came on  July 21, 2004, the brutality of the occupying  army increased with severe beatings and public  executions. Groups  of Chamorro men,  women, and children were herded into caves  on separate occasions and massacred. The  entire population was forced to march to several internment camps in the southern part of  the island.  On July 21, 1944, units of the 3rd Marine  Division, 77th Army Infantry Division and 1st  Marine Provisional Brigade, comprising a total  force of  roughly 55,000  service members,  stormed  the shores of Asan and Agat  in  southern Guam beginning the campaign to liberate  the only American community  to have  been occupied by a foreign power since the  War of 1812. Thirteen consecutive days of  heavy naval and air bombardment preceded  the  landing of U.S.  forces  to weaken Japanese defense of the island.  Intense and fierce combat between the U.S.  forces and  the entrenched Japanese Army,  which numbered 18,500 men, continued until  August 10, 1944, when organized resistance  ended and the U.S. forces seized control of  the island. The Battle for Guam was marked  by combat on difficult terrain against a wellprepared enemy. The Japanese defended the  island from positions located in caves, tunnels,  and  from pillboxes situated on  the beaches,  cliffs, and hillsides overlooking  the  invasion  beaches. Today, these beaches and many of  these defensive positions are preserved within  the War in the Pacific National Historical Park,  established by Congress in 1978 (Public Law  95–348). This Park is the only site in the National Park System  that honors  the bravery  and sacrifices of all individuals, service members and civilians, who experienced World  War II in the Pacific Theater.  Over 1,100 Chamorros died as a result of  the occupation of Guam, and every Chamorro  endured one form or another of brutality, including personal  injury,  forced  labor,  forced  march or  internment during  the occupation.  Approximately 1,800 U.S. Marines, Soldiers,  Sailors, Airmen and Coast Guardsmen were  killed  in action during  the Battle  for Guam.  There were over 8,000 U.S. casualties. The  Japanese suffered over 17,500 casualties, the  large majority of which ended in death.  Today, Guam  remains a  territory of  the  United States. Congress extended U.S. citizenship  to  the people of Guam after World  War II in 1950 (Public Law 81–630). Guam’s  current economy is largely tied to the Japanese economy given the proximity of the two  and the importance of Japanese tourism to the  island. The one million Japanese tourists the  people of Guam welcome each year is a testament to the peace and friendship that has  emerged  between  the United States  and  Japan since the end of World War II. The people of Guam remain an important part of this  international friendship.  H. Res. 737  recognizes  the Liberation of  Guam on  the occasion of  the 60th Anniversary. In doing so, the resolution calls attention  to the unique experience endured by the people of Guam and  the extraordinary heroism  VerDate jul 14 2003  06:45 Sep 30, 2004 Jkt 029060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28SE8.087 E29PT1 ",2004
1599,9,2004-10-11,Ms. LANDRIEU.," I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, I would like to continue by thanking all of the Members  of this body, particularly the members  of the Finance Committee, particularly  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma,  who  stepped forward and helped us to negotiate a very good end to this situation.  But  the original cosponsors of  this  amendment were  Senator MURRAY,  Senator TIMJOHNSON, Senator MARIA  CANTWELL, Senator JONCORZINE, Senator KERRY, Senator DURBIN, Senator  DODD, and Senator PRYOR. There were  21 Senators who signed the letter to  the conferees and I am going to submit  their names to the RECORD, but among  them was Senator BOND, who has been  a strong advocate for the Guard and  Reserve; Senator AKAKA, who came to  the floor over the weekend to lend his  support and his help; Senator BILL  NELSON, who came to the floor as well  and gave his help and his support. I  also wish to thank the leadership, Senator DASCHLEand Senator REID in particular, as well as the Republican leadership, who worked hard through these  couple of days to make this good end  come to be today; particularly Senator  HARKIN, who was in the Chamber advocating for a different issue that was his  primary focus, but without his help in  being able to hold the floor and being  able to keep the procedure moving in  the direction that helped us to make  our point, it would not have happened.  I also wish to thank the Senator from  Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, for spending  many hours in the Chamber. He and  the  Senator  from  South  Carolina,  GRAHAM, have  spoken hour  after hour after hour on  this  floor  about the needs of the Guard and Reserve.  Perhaps we are not making our arguments clear enough; I do not know. But  they  seem  to  sometimes  leave our  mouths and fall on deaf ears. I do not  think it is complicated; 690,000 Americans have been called up by our Commander in Chief to go to the front line.  As we put bills together here, tax bills,  health care bills, education bills, transportation bills, could we please not  keep them in mind but put them in the  bill and not leave them out. They are  not asking for much. They are not asking for 100 percent of any tax credit.  But surely $2 billion out of 137 is something we could have done. I know there  were arguments, and I think somewhat  legitimate—perhaps  the  amendment  was not written in the correct way.  Perhaps  it was a  little more complicated. We have successfully cleared  up those complications.  I have said  there were other amendments in here  that to me seemed quite complicated.  One in particular was a reimbursement for railroad track maintenance. I  guess we trust the railroads to tell us  how many miles. I don’t think we send  LINDSEY out people  to walk  the  tracks and  measure the railroad tracks. So I think  we trust employers when they say they  are paying their Guard and national  Reserve and they put that on their tax  return. I think most certainly we can  trust them and trust the members of  our Guard and Reserve. We are trusting  them to fight for us and we stand with  them. We are honoring the employers,  small and  large companies that are  keeping those paychecks whole, and  the least we can do is to provide a 50-  percent tax credit.  I also wish to thank the floor staff:  Lula Davis and Mary Paone, as well as  the Republican staff who helped this  weekend, and the Senate Finance Committee staff which helped us to work  out the final details. On my own staff:  Jason Matthews, Jeffrey Wiener, Kevin  Avery, Kathleen Strottman, Brian Geiger, Amy Cenicola, and Linda Cox, and  particularly my husband and my children, who were supportive of this effort  because it could have gone on for many  more days.  I want to, in the few minutes I have  remaining, submit a few more things to  the RECORD.  One of them is a letter that came to  this Congress, not  from the current  Secretary of Defense, but  from  the  former  Secretary  of  Defense,  Bill  Cohen, in 1998, saying basically, while  we support the concept of providing incentives to employees of Reserve component members, the Federal Government, we at this time cannot afford  such a program, but with the increased  use of the Guard and Reserve, particularly for unplanned contingency operations, employers of our Guard and Reserve members are often faced with the  unplanned absences of their reservist  employees. They may incur additional  business expenses associated with the  unplanned absences. The report suggests that a financial incentive might  be helpful to ameliorate some of the  employer  problems,  particularly  for  small business owners.  There you have the Secretary of Defense, the former Secretary of Defense,  outlining that while they couldn’t afford to do it in a Defense bill, we most  certainly could afford to do it in a tax  bill. That is why we started working  with the tax bill and with the Finance  Committee. I am pleased to say we  have come to a good end. So in a few  minutes, by a voice vote, this amendment will be adopted. It will go over to  the House and to the House leadership  on both the Republican and the Democratic side. I urge them to look carefully at what we have sent over there,  to pass it the way it is. If they do, it  will become law right away. Perhaps  when we come back after this election  or perhaps before the election, that  could be done. But clearly the Senate  has acted with respect, with care, with  cooperation, and again I thank the Republican  leadership  and  the Democratic leadership for working so well  over the weekend to send this amendment, basically intact as we put it together, over to the House. It is now in  their court.  How much time do I have remaining?  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  COLEMAN). There is 11 minutes remaining.  Does the Senator ask unanimous consent to have the documents printed in  the RECORD?  ",2004

SPENCE,  Chairman, Committee  on National Security,  House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: The Department of  Defense report, enclosed, has been prepared  in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. Section 1232  of that Act directed submission of a report  and draft legislation to provide tax incentives to employers of members of Reserve  components.  The Department of Defense does not support submission of legislation at this time  but is submitting draft legislation as a drafting service.  Sincerely,  Enclosure: As stated.  BILLCOHEN.  A REPORT TOCONGRESSCONCERNING INCENTIVESTOEMPLOYERSOFMEMBERSOFTHE  RESERVECOMPONENTS  This report responds to the requirements  of section 1232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (P.L.  104–201, September 23, 1996), which requires a  report to the Committee on the Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives regarding tax incentives to employers  of members of Reserve components to compensate for absences of Reserve employees  due to required training and performance of  active duty.  OVERVIEW  Increasingly, members  of  the National  Guard and Reserve are being called upon to  augment the active duty forces in the post-  Cold War world. This is a sound use of resources and an integral part of our national  military strategy. More recently, Reserve  component members have responded to the  call in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY  in  Haiti, and Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/  JOINT GUARD in Bosnia.  Previous Congresses have viewed legislation that would provide incentives such as  tax expenditures as having a fixed and recurring budgetary effect. A number of methods  could resolve such a problem.  BACKGROUND  Generally, members of the Reserve components  (both National Guard and Reserve  members) are required to attend one weekend of inactive duty training per month and  14 days of active duty training annually.  Over and above this training, members are  often required to participate in mobilization  training, formal schools, and special training. Additionally, many Reservists are called  upon to provide PERSTEMPO relief (reducing the active duty Service members time  away from home station). For some individuals, this may exceed the normal Reserve  participation  requirements. Some Reserve  members, who support specific weapons platforms, are actually spending up to 180 days a  year on military duty. This is compounded  by involuntary call-ups to support missions  such as Operation DESERT STORM and  JOINT ENDEAVOR, which required the use  of the Reserve components.  In addition to this busy Reserve schedule,  the vast majority of Reserve component (RC)  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:51 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A11OC6.020 S11PT1 ",2004
1601,23,2004-10-11,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, the tax  bill conference report that will overwhelmingly pass the Senate today is an  opportunity lost. This bill is a fiscally  irresponsible giveaway full of hundreds  of special interest provisions that will  ultimately cost the taxpayers billions  of dollars.  I voted in favor of the Senate version  of this important legislation when it  passed by an overwhelming vote of 92–  5 back in May. What began as a legislative  fix to bring our Tax Code  into  compliance with  international  trade  laws has turned into a deficit busting  give away to special  interests. This  conference  report  lacks  the balance  and restraint that was critical to passage of the Senate bill.  The math on how this bill adds to the  deficit  is  simple. Repeal of  the  so-  called FSC ETI tax breaks  for U.S.  multinational companies will increase  revenue by $50 billion. Incredibly, the  conferees could not help themselves  but take the opportunity to not only  spend that $50 billion but also spend  another $100 billion with almost no  comparable  spending  offsets—adding  straight  to  the  ballooning Federal  budget deficit.  The conference report is being sold as  a godsend for American manufacturing  workers, yet Senate provisions to tie  corporate tax breaks to actual job creation have been stripped. I have to  chuckle when I hear the White House  referring to this as the ‘‘JOBS’’ conference report.  I am also disappointed that the conferees chose to drop the Senate provision sponsored by Senator LANDRIEUto  provide tax credits to employers who  make up the pay that employees lose  when they are called up for National  Guard  or  Reserve  duty.  Senator  LANDRIEUhas eloquently and forcefully  highlighted to the Senate over the past  couple  of  days why  this  provision  should not have been dropped from the  final conference report. I agree with  her outrage that the conferees included  many special interest tax provisions—  one even for ceiling fan manufacturers—but could not include a provision  that helps the men and women who are  serving their country.∑  ",2004
1602,23,2004-10-11,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, I rise  today to bring attention to section 852  of the conference report of H.R. 4520 before us today. First, I thank the managers of the conference report for accepting my amendment which added  this provision to the conference report.  The amendment codifies current Treasury proposed regulations defining off-  highway vehicle. My intention in proposing this amendment was to confirm  that Congress feels it is proper that vehicles which do not make use of, or  make only very limited use of, the public highways should not be considered a  ‘‘highway vehicle’’ for purposes of various excise tax sections, including, but  not limited to, sections 4053, 4072, 4082,  4483, 6421, and 7701, of the Internal Revenue Code.  When used on public highways, heavy  trucks put a greater stress on our roadways  than average vehicles.  In  the  past, Congress has passed laws to impose various excise taxes for large vehicles to use our national highway system. For example, there is a 12-percent  retail sales tax for large on-highway  vehicles, special taxes on tires weighing more than 40 pounds, additional  large vehicle gasoline taxes, and there  is even an annual use tax imposed on  these  heavier  vehicles.  The  overwhelming majority of the revenue generated from these provisions is placed  in the highway trust fund to rebuild  our Nation’s infrastructure.  This  issue of off-highway vehicles  and their tax status is of grave importance to my state of Kentucky. Many  companies use heavy machinery and  oversize vehicles. In Kentucky, they  are used most often at coal mines.  Some of these large vehicles are used  only internally on the mine lands while  others are used to haul materials over  our Nation’s public roads.  However, the Internal Revenue Code  itself has not defined what constitutes  a  ‘‘highway vehicle.’’ The  legislative  intent of past Congresses seems clear—  to impose excise taxes on vehicles that  disproportionately  stress  our  highways. It is important that we clarify  who should pay these taxes through the  legislative process. Current Treasury  regulations contain a number of exclusions from the definition of highway  vehicle and  therefore provide exclusions from the imposition of a number  of excise taxes which are dependent  upon this definition. One of these exclusions exempts certain vehicles specially designed for off-highway transportation for which the special design  substantially limits or impairs the use  of such vehicle to transport loads over  the highway.  I proposed the amendment to codify  this off-highway vehicle exception—an  amendment which became section 852  of this conference report—because I believe that these excise taxes should not  be imposed on vehicles which make little or no use of the public highways.  Under the definition of off-highway vehicle which  is provided  in this conference report, a vehicle is not treated  as a highway vehicle if it is specially  designed for the primary function of  transporting a particular type of load  other than over the public highway and  because of this special design its capability to transport a load over the public highway is substantially limited or  impaired. In determining whether substantial limitation or impairment exists, account may be taken of factors  such as the size of the vehicle, whether  it is subject to the licensing, safety,  and other requirements applicable to  highway vehicles, and whether it can  transport a load at a sustained speed.  The Statement of Managers accompanying this conference report states  that, when determining whether a vehicle qualifies for the off-highway exception, the fact that its considerable  physical  characteristics  for  transporting its load other than over the  public highway, when compared with  its physical characteristics for transporting the load over the public highway, establish that it is specially designed  for  the primary  function of  transporting its load other than over  the public highway. These types of vehicles should not be defined as a highway vehicle and should not be subject  to the excise taxes at issue.  We often have situation in the mining area of my state where large trucks  are used to haul coal in off-highway operations. When these trucks are designed and built, many thousands of  dollars are spent to modify standard  truck chassises before bed installation.  Generally, heavier axles, transmissions  and other drive train components, as  well as other modifications needed to  allow the vehicles to operate at lower  operating speeds carrying loads significantly heavier than those legally allowed on the highways, must be added  to the trucks. The trucks generally  have beds which, along with the truck  itself, cause the vehicle’s width to exceed that which is allowed to be operated on the public highways of any  state. Often these trucks do not need  to be licensed like on-highway vehicles  in Kentucky  and  neighboring  coal  states because the trucks are an off-  highway vehicles by state standards.  These trucks are actually so large that  it is not even legal to drive them on  highways, except in very limited circumstance usually  involving  special  trip permits. In fact, very substantial  modifications would need to be made  to the vehicles to cause them to be  legal  for  highway  use.  Insurance  agents, State licensing agents, State  sales tax officials, and even our own  transportation laws all recognize these  vehicle as  ‘‘off-highway.’’ It  is clear  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:08 Oct 12, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G11OC6.085 S11PT1 ",2004

1604,30,2004-10-11,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, before I  yield to my friend from Louisiana, I  would like to say how much I personally deeply appreciate and will miss  the Senator  from Louisiana. I don’t  know any Senator who works harder on  a bipartisan basis to get things done  than the Senator from Louisiana. He is  amazing. He has so many talents.  Now, maybe he  is partly Cajun, I  don’t know, but it is that Louisiana  stuff that enables him to see more, do  more, be more creative, think of more  ideas than the rest of us mortals in the  Senate. He is amazing. He is always  thinking, always working. Many times  in the Finance Committee I look over  to the Senator from Louisiana and he  is there working. He is reading reams  of briefing materials. He has his magic  marker out and he is underlining and  learning this stuff. And he knows it so  well.  There are many areas he does know  so well. One is health care. He knows  health care intricacies probably better  than anybody else in this body. He has  worked with it on several commissions.  He cares passionately about reforming  our health care system.  Tax  policy, Social Security,  you  name it, if it is before the jurisdiction  of the Finance Committee, he is very  knowledgeable about it. He also, frankly, wants solutions. It is not just that  he has knowledge and is very smart,  but he is looking to try to find solutions, looking for compromises, looking for ways to get things done.  We are going to sorely miss him; I  mean sorely. I do not know what we  are going to do without him because he  is a catalyst, not the only catalyst but  one of the major catalysts, here to get  agreements, to get solutions. We all  know how partisan this place is. He is  one of those who is cutting against the  grain to try to do what is right, do  what is right for Louisiana, do what is  right for the country, getting a practical solution: Come on, let’s get something done here that makes sense. You  may not like it totally, you may not  like it completely, but, heck, you all  know this is more than half a loaf, it is  three-quarters, seven-eighths of a loaf,  so it is certainly better than no loaf.  So come on, let’s get something done  here.  He is wonderful. I want him to know  how much I am personally going to  miss him.  ",2004

1608,37,2004-10-11,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I would  like to focus the attention of the Senate on the recent devastation to many  nations in the Caribbean as a result of  a half a dozen hurricanes and tropical  storms in the autumn of this year, 2004.  More than a thousand people have  perished; many are still missing. Thousands of families are homeless and jobless. Non-governmental organizations  such as the International Red Cross,  the United Nations, and religious organizations, rushed to the scene with relief aid and volunteers to help the survivors. The United States Government  has sent U.S. AID teams to assess the  damage. Early estimates reveal hundreds of millions of dollars of physical  damage to homes and businesses. On  the Island of Grenada industries have  been completely wiped out. There are  riots in the streets of cities in Haiti  where stockpiles of nonperishable food  and potable water are diminishing fast.  In April, 2001 President Bush instituted  the  ‘‘Third Border  Initiative’’  that anticipated a quick response by  our government  that would,  in his  words, ‘‘. . . fund disaster preparedness  and mitigation efforts to shield critical  commercial and environmental infrastructure from natural disasters, such  as hurricanes.’’ This is important because it signals a focus not only on  emergency assistance, but on trying to  reduce the amount of damage caused  by future hurricanes. In other words,  the President was also signaling a welcome focus on rebuilding homes and  businesses in a manner that is resistant to potential damage by hurricanes.  These types of buildings would also reduce the dreadful death toll of future  hurricanes.  We have an opportunity to aid our  friends and partners in the Caribbean.  The administration has attached a $50  million request for the Caribbean to a  larger package of help for Florida and  other States in the South hit by the  rolling series of storms this summer  and  fall. Our colleagues  in the U.S.  House  of Representatives  have  requested an additional $50 million, so  the total is $100 million for the Caribbean. Secretary Colin Powell recently  visited Grenada and stated that the  first aid will come in phases, starting  with an emergency shipment of food,  medicine, construction materials and  other  supplies,  about  a  quarter  of  which will go to Grenada.  It is at this time that we have an opportunity to thoughtfully help the region. As Secretary Powell said, ‘‘. . .  that help was needed not simply to repair homes and schools, but also to restore the economic  infrastructure of  the country.’’ He went on to say that,  ‘‘experts had begun discussing ‘creative  suggestions’ for how Grenada could diversify its agricultural output. . . .’’ I  agree with Secretary Powell that the  time has come to try to better spend  our assistance dollars. As is the case  with weather disasters, economic disasters also ruin the hopes of families. As  long as we are helping in the rebuilding  efforts, we should try to make more  permanent  improvements  in  infrastructure.  The  region needs many  ‘‘creative  suggestions’’ for its redevelopment. At  the University of Vermont, the students and faculty have made many suggestions,  from agriculture and  food  processing  to  sustainable permanent  modular housing solutions utilizing recycled materials. One appropriate solution has been devised by world acclaimed architect Adam Kalkin. It is  the Quikbuild Modular System. An example of this unique, sustainable housing solution is on display in the permanent collection of the Shelburne Museum, in Shelburne, Vermont.  This type of dwelling utilizes recycled cargo containers, many of which  are being shipped down to the region  with a full load; they will remain there  empty without the cargo to fill them;  and with no place to ship them. Each is  an ecological disaster waiting to happen. They also present a great opportunity if we take advantage of using  them.  Recycled  containers may  be  converted into durable, sustainable, water-  tight, hurricane-proof dwellings that  can be used as permanent housing as  well as field kitchens, medical triage  units, schools, dormitories, as well as  structures  for commercial businesses  and meeting places. Ten percent of the  funds we provide should be for these  more permanent housing solutions. It  is  imperative  that  the  community  planners consider mid-range and long-  term solutions today as they manage  the ‘‘first response’’ mission. We have  seen in many regions around the globe  that well-intentioned  temporary and  transitional  housing  ultimately  becomes permanent housing. Priorities  shift, money runs out and a new disaster knocks the old disaster off the  front page. The  inherent nature of  shanty towns, full of permanent refugees, takes away the dignity and hope  of their inhabitants.  I have received pleas from the family  members residing in the United States  to help their  loved ones. I have received a strong request from the Ambassador of the Republic of Trinidad  and  Tobago,  Ambassador  Marina  Valere, on behalf of the affected nations imploring us to also think about  permanent housing solutions, that also  respects their unique and fragile ecosystem. This request made clear that  some portion of the aid package should  be  set aside  for  this purpose. Our  friends in the Caribbean need permanent, safe, secure dwellings otherwise  this crisis will repeat itself, year after  year.  In addition to urgent emergency aid,  America should help the survivors in  the Caribbean to rebuild their communities with permanent housing solutions as well as rebuild their respective  economies.∑  ∑",2004
1609,37,2004-10-11,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, with reservations I support passage of the conference report to the fiscal year 2005  Military Construction Appropriations  Act. This bill provides $10 billion in  funding  for  important military construction  activities  including  base  housing as well as the construction and  maintenance of base infrastructure.  When we passed the Senate version of  this legislation, I declared that this appropriations bill was a good example of  how the legislative process is expected  to work, wherein the work of the authorizers is fully taken into account by  the appropriators. The legislation was  relatively free of earmarks and riders  that were not related to Military Construction. However, during  the conference, a legislative rider that has no  business in an appropriations bill found  its way into the conference report.  I am referring to the section of the  conference report that authorizes a $18  billion loan guarantee program for the  construction of an Alaska natural gas  pipeline. This authorizing provision is  found in neither the House nor the Senate version of this legislation, yet with  characteristically  little attention,  it  has found its way into the conference  report. Once again,  it pays to have  powerful members of the Appropriations  Committee  representing  your  State or district.  Congress has a  legislative process  that has two separate tracks for authorization and appropriation.

We reached that agreement, which  was embodied also in a letter from the  two leaders to Senators DOMENICIand  INOUYE, who had inquired of that possibility, in which the leaders promised  their best efforts to ensure that a native Hawaiian bill equivalent to S. 344  would be brought to the Senate floor  for debate and resolution no later than  August 7 of next year.  I had told both Senators from Hawaii  I would express publicly my personal  commitment to assist in that effort to  ensure that no procedural roadblocks  would be thrown in the way of the consideration of that  legislation, nor a  final vote on it. I will indeed do that  and encourage all of my colleagues to  work with us toward that end.

Many Senators had  a part in this very major bill, with 24,  28, maybe even 30 pieces of legislation  for their States.  I say to the Senators from Hawaii,  you had a perfect right to insist that  your bill, which has just been described  by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, be in that bill. That could have  caused the bill to probably be here a  long time, the big bill, and you graciously said, if we can work something  else out, let’s try. We did.  As a result, we passed this bill for  many Senators, and we said to you,  both Senators from Hawaii, we will do  our best to get your very important  bill, described by the Senator from Arizona, up. We cannot assure that. I cannot guarantee that. This is the Senate.  But we do have a letter with all of the  people who are in the leadership, I, myself, by the distinguished two Senators  from Arizona, that we will do our best.  We described it and everyone knows of  it.  Today we thought we would tell the  Senate and give this assurance in the  RECORD to our two Senators from Hawaii that we are serious, that we will  do our part in trying to make sure  their bill comes to a vote in the Senate  by the date they have agreed to and we  have agreed to.

1624,51,2004-10-11,Mr. KENNEDY.," The  article  does  track one slice of the workforce: temporary workers. Since January 2002,  the nation has added 369,000 temporary  positions, about half of the private-sector jobs created during that stretch.  This report says half of all the private sector jobs created under this Administration  since January  2002 are  temporary positions. These are  jobs  without  benefits.  You  talk  about  health insurance or retirement? Those  are virtually nonexistent.  This  is what  is happening  in this  country. It is amazing to me to hear  the President talk about how the economy is growing and crow about the increased numbers of jobs that we had—  96,000 this  last month, which  is not  even  enough  to keep up with  the  growth of the population. And then we  find a third of those jobs are Government jobs, a third are temporary jobs,  and the other third are not paying very  much.  I want to also mention that, as difficult as this is, those are figures that  point out what happens to real people  in their lives. But whatever happens to  these individuals I have just mentioned  pales in comparison to the kind of pain  minorities  and women  are  feeling;  women, whose  real  income has declined, and minorities—Hispanics, African Americans—whose unemployment  has increased dramatically.  I see the Senator from Maryland on  his feet now. I am interested in his reaction to that hearing and to those figures.  Before I run out of time, I would also  like him to address the subject of the  foreign purchase of over half of the  U.S. debt. Nearly $2 trillion of the national debt is now owned by foreign  holders. Recent figures show China and  Japan  owning  $1.3  trillion  in U.S.  Treasuries. I am concerned these forthe Senator  eign nations are basically buying up  America. We know who has the whip in  hand when you control the resources.  One morning we will wake up and foreign countries will own America.  If  they control our economy, then they  control  our  destiny. The American  economy and American destiny ought  to be in Americans hands.  ",2004
1625,51,2004-10-11,Mr. SARBANES., Will  yield on that last point?  ,2004
1626,51,2004-10-11,Mr. KENNEDY., I am glad to.  ,2004
1627,51,2004-10-11,Mr. SARBANES.," The fact of the matter  is,  the  tax  cuts  for  the  very  wealthy, which is the centerpiece of  the Bush economic plan, are being financed  by  borrowing  overseas,  primarily from China and Japan. That is  what it comes down to. We do these excessive tax cuts, we run a deficit, and  we have to finance the deficit. Where  do they find the money to finance the  deficit? They  sell U.S. Government  paper overseas, primarily to Japan and  China. So we are borrowing money  from overseas in order to finance these  tax cuts.  It is bad enough to borrow internally,  from our own people, in order to do  this. But to go overseas and do it, as  the Senator points out, and then give  them this claim on American production on out into the future as far as one  can see is absolutely irresponsible.  The  Senator  from Massachusetts  made a very important point.  The President and his associates are  busy out in the countryside trying to  put the spin on the jobs figures. The  fact is, the economy picked up 96,000  jobs last month. That is not enough to  keep pace with the growth in population. This is the first administration  since Herbert Hoover not to produce a  net gain of jobs in the course of the administration. The Bush administration  is down 800,000 jobs, a total of 1.6 million private sector jobs, and 2.7 million  manufacturing jobs.  The last time you have an administration which failed to have a net gain  in jobs in the course of its 4 years was  75 years ago in the administration of  Herbert Hoover. This is a dismal job  performance record. Yet the President  is going around the country telling  people we have turned the corner. The  trouble is every time you go around  the corner we are going in the wrong  direction. That is the problem with the  President’s  policies. He may  have  turned the corner, but the corner is  taking us in the wrong direction.  Second, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, if you factor into  the unemployment rate the people who  have dropped out of seeking a job because they are so discouraged by the  economic conditions they encounter,  and people are working part time for  economic reasons—namely, they want  to work full time but they can’t find a  full time job, so they are working part  time—if you include that in the unemployment figure as well, which is the  most comprehensive measure of unemployment, the unemployment figure is  9.4 percent, coming up to 10 percent unemployed.  The final point I want to make is  that unemployment benefits usually—  and it is a very important point because I see many colleagues on the  floor who have joined with the Senator  from Massachusetts and myself to try  to  extend  unemployment  insurance  benefits, and the Senator from Washington was very much involved in that  effort and we welcome so strongly her  leadership  in  it—usually are  for  26  weeks. When we hit an economic downturn, we extend it because the job market doesn’t pick up quickly enough to  get people back to work. We usually  extend it out to 39 weeks. The administration has resisted efforts to extend  the payment period for unemployment  insurance. We now have a record number of long-term unemployed.  This is the record even before the  Bush administration of the long-term  unemployed. It ran along here, and now  it has shot up to almost 22 percent of  those unemployed who have been long-  term unemployed.  ",2004
1628,51,2004-10-11,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, in this  article,  besides  the  administration  being against the increase in the minimum wage, they are against unemployment  compensation and against  overtime. In this report in 1982, there  were  417,000 workers classified  temporary. Today, there are 2.5 million.  This is about equal to the number of  manufacturing  jobs  lost  in the past  decade.  These are the statements that we  have about how good the economy is.  ",2004
1629,51,2004-10-11,Mr. SARBANES.," The Senator is absolutely right. We are confronting a  very serious economic situation for our  workers. There is real anxiety—indeed  even fear—in working America about  what is going to happen to people in  terms of their employment and how  they support their families. But we are  not producing jobs fast enough to put  people back to work. Yet the administration won’t support extending payments for unemployment insurance.  How are these people supposed to  support their families? These are working people. By definition, you cannot  draw unemployment insurance benefits  unless you have a work record. You  must have been working and have built  up a working record in order to qualify.  We are talking about working Americans. How do they support their families?  The President talks about 95,000 jobs  as though it is some success. It is not  a success. This is the only President in  75 years in that entire period of time  who has not had a net gain of jobs during his administration.  ",2004

1633,86,2004-10-11,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I also  want to talk about a few of the things  that have happened here this year in  the course of our deliberations and debate on legislation in the Senate and in  the Congress.  One of the issues I would like to talk  about—and it came to a head here at  the end—has to do with agriculture.  But before I get into that, I want to  talk about overtime pay. Then I want  to talk about agriculture and conservation.  Last week, in a replay of what happened almost a year ago, the Bush administration used a conference committee to kill my provision to stop the  Department of Labor’s new  rule on  overtime pay, a new rule which, if it is  allowed to stand, will strip 6 million  workers of their right to time-and-a-  half overtime pay.  Once again, the overtime provision I  offered and which was adopted by the  Senate was killed  in conference, despite votes in both Houses of Congress  demonstrating strong bipartisan support for my amendment to stop these  onerous rules of the President  from  going into effect and denying the right  of overtime pay  to  some  6 million  Americans.  Now, yesterday, we  in the Senate,  yet again, voted to protect hard-working Americans’ right to earn overtime  pay.  That  bill we  passed—as  the  amendments I have offered before that  we passed four times—serves the simplest of purposes. It lets stand the new  threshold of $23,660, below which anyone who is working is automatically  guaranteed the right to overtime pay,  and it guarantees that no worker who  currently receives overtime pay would  lose the right to overtime under the  new rule. That  is what this Senate  voted  to keep  four  times, and  the  House, twice.  This is a subject I feel deeply about,  and I know I am not alone. Wherever I  travel  in  the United States, people  come up to me and talk about what  overtime pay means to them and their  families. They can become quite emotional about it. They know what this  administration is trying to do. They  are  angry  that  this  administration  wants to roll back this new overtime  rule.  It  is a simple matter of honoring  work. People believe that when they  put in more than 40 hours of work in a  week, that they are giving up their premium time, their time with their families, and that their employers should  provide them with premium pay if they  are giving up their premium time.  Also, many Americans rely on that  premium pay as a substantial part of  their income—to put a little bit aside  for a college education, a rainy day  fund, or perhaps maybe to buy a better  house, move up the ladder a little bit,  buy a new car.  Other people, to tell the truth, would  just rather not work a lot of overtime  hours. They believe a 40-hour workweek is a full workweek. That is what  the Fair Labor Standards Act established when Congress passed it in 1938.  It established in law the principle of a  40-hour workweek, that anyone basically who works over that gets time-  and-a-half overtime pay. That was 1938.  But get this,  in 1933, this Senate,  right here  in this very Chamber—in  1933, after lengthy debate—passed a bill  to establish not a 40-hour workweek, or  50-hours, as it was then, but a 30-hour  workweek—a  30-hour workweek,  in  1933. Think about  that. They voted  here to establish a 30-hour workweek  in 1933.  Congress fought about it for about 5  years, and finally, in 1938, they compromised at 40 hours. It has been that  way ever since. I will bet we couldn’t  pass a bill in this Senate today to establish a 50-hour workweek. By letting  these rules go into effect, we are telling people, hey, you can work over 40  hours a week, but don’t expect time-  and-a-half overtime pay. That is exactly what we are talking about.  Again, we know that if overtime is  free to the employer, if they don’t have  to pay anymore, they will work people  overtime. This chart illustrates that.  The red block is those who have no  overtime protection. The green  represents people who do have overtime  pay protection. Of  those who have  overtime protection, only 19 percent  work more than 40 hours a week, about  one out of every five. These are people  who get paid for overtime. But if you  are not eligible for overtime pay, 44  percent work more than 40 hours a  week, almost one out of every two. So  if you don’t have overtime pay protection, you are twice as likely to work  overtime.  How about working more  than  50  hours a week? If you have overtime pay  protection, only about 5 percent work  more than 50 hours a week, but if you  don’t have overtime pay protection,  three times as many—15 percent—work  more than 50 hours a week.  That  tells  the whole  story  right  there. That is what is happening. If  this new rule is allowed to stand, we  will be back here 5, 6, 7 years from now,  and you are going to see this red mark  way up there, 50, 60 percent or more of  people without overtime pay protection working more than 40 hours a  week.  Last year, the Bush administration  launched an assault on the time-honored principle of time and a half pay  for over 40 hours. Actually the proposal  of the President came out in a set of  proposed rules from the Department of  Labor. The Fair Labor Standards Act  of 1938 has been amended and changed  a number of times since 1938, but it has  always been done through the legislative process, not administrative rulemaking.  Ordinarily, the administration comes  to Congress. They say they would like  to modify the Fair Labor Standards  Act for one reason or another. The appropriate committees have hearings.  They bring in witnesses. We work it  out. We bring it to the floor. We pass  it. It goes to a conference with the  House, and it is sent to the President  for signature. That is the way it ought  to be done.  This time,  for the  first time, this  President issued a proposed set of regulations drastically changing the overtime pay rules without one public hearing. They issued these proposed rules  without having one public hearing. It  actually took us several weeks, kind of  plodding through the proposed rules, to  see what  they were proposing. The  magnitude was breathtaking.  Some of the most harmful provisions  were not discovered until months later.  Frankly, we were shocked when we  first saw in these proposed rules of the  administration  that  they were proposing to strip overtime pay from police  officers,  firefighters,  veterans,  nurses, and many others—radical stuff.  Of course, once the true intent and extent became known, many of those affected were  in  open  rebellion. We  talked about it, and I talked about it  here on the Senate floor.  When  the  Department  of  Labor  issued the final rule just this spring,  the White House seemed to have an  election year  conversion. Under  extreme pressure from labor unions as  well as us here in Congress, the administration backed off  its attempt  to  strip overtime from certain high-profile groups such as rank-and-file police  officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians. I salute the efforts of  many  individuals  and  groups who  fought hard and who forced the administration to abandon several of these  most offensive and egregious proposals.  But what did the change do? They  took us from an estimated 8 million  people hurt by these overtime rules to  6 million. So basically we went from a  proposed set of rules that were profoundly terrible to a set of rules that  were just plain terrible.  The administration said they fixed it  up. Sure, I admit there are about 2 million fewer people who were affected in  the final rules, policemen and others.  But make no mistake about it, up to 6  million hard-working Americans earning as little as $23,661 a year will lose  their right to time-and-a-half overtime  pay.  ",2004

1637,93,2004-10-11,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, at  the  close of the 108th Congress, we say  farewell  to Senator PETER G. FITZis  leaving us after one  GERALDwho  term.  The  former  congressional  intern,  commercial banking attorney, and Illinois State Senator was elected to the  U.S. Senate in 1998. In fact, he was the  first Republican in Illinois to win a  Senate seat in 20 years.  It has been a busy 6 years for Senator  FITZGERALD. During his brief tenure in  this chamber he served on the Senate  Agriculture, Commerce, Government  Affairs, Small Business,  and Aging  Committees. He was active in a number  of legislative areas, including mutual  fund reform, consumer safety protection, aviation, environmental, and agricultural issues. And he actively pursued the expansion of overseas markets.  During his 6 years in this chamber,  Senator FITZGERALDthrew himself into  some of the most challenging and complex issues considered by the Senate. In  2000, he attacked waste in Government  contracting and crafted legislation to  improve the process by which contractors are awarded taxpayer monies. He  later worked with me to address the  Pentagon’s ‘‘revolving door’’—an egregious practice utilized by government  contractors in exerting influence over  the contracting process. In 2002, the  former commercial banking attorney  lashed out at Enron executives who  robbed thousands of workers of millions of dollars of their life savings,  and he later crafted legislation to reform the mutual fund industry.  Time and again he showed himself to  be a Senator who is not intimidated by  complexity. He did not simply talk  about the issues of the day, he took  time to study them, and understand  them, and then try to do something  about them. Time and again he demonstrated that he was a workhorse, not  a show horse. The Senate needs more  members like him, Senators whom we  can look to when confronting difficult  and complex issues.  And the Senate needs more Senators  like Senator FITZGERALDwho, on a  number of high-profile issues, including gun control, health care, patient’s  bill of rights, and the environment,  ANWR drilling, put the good of the  people of his State, in particular, and  the American people, in general, above  partisan party interests and ideology.  In attacking political corruption and  cronyism, he was bipartisan, not simply in rhetoric, which is easy, but rather in action, which is a good deal more  difficult.  I wish Senator FITZGERALD and his  wife Nina the best as they begin a new  phase of their lives.  SENATORJOHNBREAUX  ",2004

1639,100,2004-10-11,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, we live in  a nation of the most creative and inventive people in the world, but apparently  some  of my Republican  colleagues do not appreciate them or their  efforts. Thanks to the ingenuity, the  inspiration, and the hard work of thousands of our fellow citizens, the United  States enjoys the best in artistic expression  and  technological  advancement, but that seems to mean little to  those Senators. We enjoy the fruits of  the labors of all the inventors and authors and artists—and of all the people  who work in connection with them—  not only as individuals but as a nation,  but not everyone here recognizes the  debt we owe them. In the twenty-first  century, it is intellectual property that  keeps this country at the forefront of  the world economy, and what preserves  our force as a global power, and I would  think that those across the aisle would  value the importance of that power.  Affording that intellectual property  the most straightforward and reasonable protections, and giving  law enforcement officials  the  resources  to  give those protections genuine power,  would seem to be a sensible goal. Indeed, failing to do so would be unconscionable. In the United States, copyright industries alone account for 12  percent of the gross domestic product,  and employ more than 11 million people. Those copyright  industries have  been adding workers at an annual rate  that exceeds that of the economy as a  whole by 27 percent, and those industries  have  achieved  annual  foreign  sales and exports of almost $90 billion.  But some Republicans are preventing  the Senate from passing the most important  intellectual property  legislation before the Congress this year, and  they  are  hiding  behind  anonymous  holds. This is wrong.  Senator HATCH and I, and many of  our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, have been working on this legislation for some time now—most recently  doing  so  late  at night  and  through the weekends. We have done so  because of the crushing need to ensure  that the intellectual property laws are  adequate to the legitimate and pressing concerns raised by many about the  effectiveness of those laws. We have a  package  of  strong  and  significant  measures that would bolster protection  of the intellectual property that drives  our nation’s economy and that would  ensure law enforcement has the tools it  needs to offer that protection. There  was no reason not to send this package  to the House immediately, and work  with our colleagues there to ensure it  became enacted into law, as soon as  humanly possible.  In blocking this legislation, these Republicans are failing to practice what  they have so often preached during this  Congress. For all of their talk about  jobs,  about  allowing  the American  worker to succeed, they are now placing  our  economy  at  greater  risk  through their inaction. It is a failure  that will  inevitably continue a disturbing trend: our economy loses literally hundreds of billions of dollars  every year to various forms of piracy.  Instead of making  inroads  in this  fight, we have the Republican intellectual property roadblock. It is a barrier  that stands in the way of the CREATE  Act, a noncontroversial bill the text of  which has already passed both the Senate and House. The CREATE Act clarifies an  important component of the  Bayh-Dole Act  that, when  read  literally by the courts, runs counter to  Congress’s intent. By failing to make  this clarification Congress is creating a  deterrent to  forming the very same  public-private  research  partnerships  meant to be encouraged by that Act.  These partnerships have proved incredibly beneficial to universities, the private sector, the American worker, and  the U.S. economy. All are placed in  jeopardy by Congressional inaction.  The roadblock has also scuttled the  ART Act, a bill that passed the Judiciary Committee and then the full Senate by unanimous consent. This legislation would have provided new tools  in the fight against bootleg copies of  movies snatched from the big screen by  camcorders  smuggled  into  theaters.  And it would have adopted a creative  solution developed by the Copyright  Office to address the growing problem  of piracy of pre-release works. Our  anonymous Republican friends have ensured  that  these  problems  are  left  unaddressed by the 108th Congress.  The PIRATE Act, too, passed the  Senate by unanimous consent. That  bill would have given to the Attorney  General new tools in the fight against  piracy of books, music, movies and  other creative works. Senator BIDEN’s  Anticounterfeiting Act, which would  have marked a step  forward  in the  fight against software piracy, was also  included  in the  intellectual property  package. We can tell our software companies that they will have to wait at  least another year  for the remedies  promised by this legislation. And it is  important to note that the Business  Software Alliance tell us that $29 billion  in  software was  stolen  in  2003  alone.  There  are  other  noncontroversial  provisions in this legislation as well,  such as language that would help ensure that the Library of Congress is  able to continue its important work in  archiving our nation’s fading film heritage. Some of America’s oldest films—  works that document who we were as a  people in the beginning of the 20th century—are literally disintegrating faster than they can be saved.  None of these were partisan provisions. And when Senator HATCHand I  put our names on the same piece of legislation, you can bet that the result is  never a bill that veers very far to the  right or the left. He and I have worked  together to produce a great deal of  good intellectual property policy over  the years, and I am sorry to see that  some on his side of the aisle have  blocked our efforts at similar progress  this year.  We can foresee the disappointing result of this roadblock: our copyright  holders will suffer, our patent holders  will suffer, and so too will the American worker. In yet another important  area, the Republicans that control the  House of Representatives, the Senate,  and the White House, have failed to respond to the needs of the American  people. That is a shame.∑  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:51 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G11OC6.114 S11PT1 ",2004
1640,107,2004-10-11,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, the water  users and providers of Arizona have  waited a long time for this day. The  Arizona Water Settlements Act, S. 437,  is the product of 15 years of negotiation, litigation, and more negotiation.  Virtually every major water user and  provider in central Arizona has devoted  itself to the passage of this bill. In fact,  S. 437 would codify the largest water  claims settlement in the history of Arizona. The three titles in this bill represent the tremendous efforts of literally hundreds of people in Arizona  and here in Washington over a period  of 15 years. Looking ahead, this bill  could ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona’s future as was the authorization  of  the Central Arizona  Project, CAP, itself.  Since Arizona began receiving CAP  water from the Colorado River, litigation has divided water users over how  the CAP water should be allocated and  exactly how much Arizona was  required to repay the Federal Government. This  bill will,  among  other  things, codify the settlement reached  between the United States and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District over the State’s repayment obligation for costs incurred by the United  States in constructing the Central Arizona Project. It will also resolve, once  and for all, the allocation of all remaining CAP water. This final allocation will provide  the  stability necessary for State water authorities to  plan for Arizona’s future water needs.  In addition, approximately 200,000 acre-  feet of CAP water will be made available  to  settle various  Indian water  claims in the State. The bill would also  authorize the use of the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund,  which is funded solely from revenues  paid by Arizona entities, to construct  irrigation works necessary for tribes  with congressionally approved water  settlements to use CAP water.  Title II of this bill settles the water  rights claims of the Gila River Indian  Community. It allocates nearly 100,000  acre-feet of CAP water to the community, and provides funds to subsidize  the costs of delivering CAP water and  to construct the facilities necessary to  allow the community to fully utilize  the water allocated to it in this settlement. Title III provides for long-needed  amendments to the 1982 Southern Arizona Water Settlement Act  for  the  Tohono O’odham Nation, which has  never been fully implemented. Title IV  creates a placeholder for a future settlement on the Gila River for the San  Carlos Apache Tribe and reiterates the  fact that titles I, II, and III do not affect the water rights claims of the San  Carlos Apache Tribe or the claims of  the United States on their behalf.  For the San Carlos Apache Tribe and  other Indian communities in Arizona  that have not yet settled their water  rights claims, this bill offers hope for  the future. This bill creates a fund for  future Indian water settlements in Arizona. In addition, through this legislation, 67,300 acre-feet of CAP water will  be set aside for future Indian water  rights settlements. The water needs of  each Indian tribe in Arizona are particular to that individual tribe. Likewise, the contours of each Indian water  rights settlement must be tailored to  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:51 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G11OC6.124 S11PT1 ",2004
1641,121,2004-10-11,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  am pleased to be joined by Senators  CAMPBELLand INOUYE in submitting a  resolution to honor American Indian,  Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian  veterans for their service in the Armed  Forces of the United States and to designate November 7, 2004 as ‘‘National  Native American Veterans Day’’.  This is the second consecutive year  that such a resolution has been introduced. November 7, 2003 was designated  as National Native American Veterans  Day in accordance with Senate Resolution 239. I was proud to join with Senator  our  distinguished  CAMPBELL,  chairman of the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs and Senator INOUYE, the  distinguished  vice  chairman  of  the  committee,  and  others  of my  colleagues  in cosponsoring that resolution. As the events of conflict in Iraq  continue we all hope and pray for the  safe return of the men and women who  are overseas, far from home protecting  our Nation and others.  We continue to honor the memory of  Army  Private  First  Class  Lori  Piestewa, a Hopi woman, who fought  valiantly and bravely to protect her  fellow soldiers during the invasion of  Iraq. This year we also remember other  Native people who lost their lives in  Iraq over the past year. Army Sergeant  Lee Duane Todacheene, Marine Lance  Corporal Quinn A. Keith, Army Private  First Class Harry Shondee, Jr, members of the Navajo Nation, and Army  Private First  Class  Sheldon Hawk  Eagle, Cheyenne River Sioux, whose Indian name was Wanbli Ohitika, or  Brave Eagle. I apologize if I have failed  to acknowledge a brave Native person  who lost his or her life in Iraq.  Native people, and especially the Native people of my State of Alaska, revere, admire, and respect our veterans  and those who continue to serve. They  pray for ones still in battle, alongside  their fellow Americans, so that they  can have a safe journey back to their  loving homes and families. They pray  for the ones who have fought, and now,  continue their journey through life’s  struggles.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this resolution.

1658,142,2004-10-11,Mr. FRIST.," Mr. President, we are on  our final stretch. Before we leave for  our adjournment prior to the election,  I do want to take a couple of minutes  to talk about the pending nominations.  The pending nominations have become an issue because it has gotten  longer and longer and longer, in terms  of the list. I am very disappointed. We  have had a hugely successful session.  The last 6 weeks and the last 3 days  have  been  tremendously  productive,  but I am very disappointed that we  leave here today stranding about, I believe it is 153 pending nominations that  are on the Executive Calendar today.  All of us have noted the calendar gets  thicker and thicker, and it is because  there are  153 nominations  that are  being held up.  For my colleagues, all of them know,  but for others listening, these nominations have all been received from the  President. The President has made the  nominations. All of them have gone  through the committee process. All are  now available for Senate consideration.  That is our responsibility. But now in  the last few moments before we finished our business—I am not going to  go through the details why, I am not  going to rehash why. But we find ourselves  in a stalled position with 153  nominees right here who are being obstructed. Some on the other side of the  aisle have said they have nominations  which they want considered and until  that happens everybody is going to be  held up. Indeed, that is what has happened. It is a scorched-earth-type policy which should not be tolerated. I am  troubled by it. I hear such words as,  Well, if I can’t have my person or the  White House is not sending up the person that I asked for, I am going to punish everybody. That is what has happened.  We have 153 people who are on the  calendar who are ready and available  to go. Many of them have put their  lives on hold. They have dedicated  themselves  to  public  service. They  have gone all the way through the system and they came to this point—to  the floor right here—and they are obstructed.  On the calendar, ready and available  to go are ambassadorships, critical ambassadorships, for example, to Qatar,  Estonia, they are representatives to  the United Nations who are being held  up, nominations to the Department of  Housing and Urban Development positions, various positions at the Environmental  Protection Agency,  to  the  Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, to the Department of Education nominations, the Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary being held up,  and nominations to African Development being held up. There are more  than 25 pages of nominations being  held up.  These are real people. These are not  just names on the calendar. These are  real people. They have subjected themselves to the process. They said, Yes, I  am willing to serve, but they are being  obstructed. Most of these nominations  have gone all the way through the system without any opposition and  for  most  there  is  absolutely  no  controversy with their particular nomination. But they are being held hostage.  They are being held hostage, I believe  unreasonably, and it should not be tolerated. It is within a Senator’s right to  do that, but to me it is just wrong.  These are people committed to public  service. There is no controversy about  them as  individuals. They are being  held hostage.  I understand this is not the first time  we failed to act on nominations or the  first time nominations have been held  up to unrelated issues.  But I am disappointed that there are  Members in this body who have taken  to such an extreme position—25 pages  of nominations.  This whole concept of putting blanket holds on everybody and holding everybody hostage simply is not appropriate and I believe is a disservice to  the country. But that is what is happening. To me it is not responsible. It  is not legislating responsibly.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:39 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00142 Fmt 4637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G11OC6.157 S11PT1 ",2004
1659,149,2004-10-11,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to honor the Neighborhood Watch  Program of Fairfax County, Virginia.  In the 25 years since its inception, the Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch Program has  achieved great success, with over 900 community programs established since its inception. As former Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, I can personally attest to the program’s accomplishment.  The Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch  boasts countless volunteers who have selflessly committed themselves to informing local  police of suspicious activities. While it is financially and logistically impossible to place a police officer on every street corner, the neighborhood watch has provided Fairfax County  with an effective alternative. Neighborhood  watch volunteers have become the eyes and  ears of local police, deterring crime and saving  taxpayers millions of dollars.  Those who take the time to cast a watchful  eye on  their surroundings ensure a safer,  friendlier place  to  live. Through committed  neighborhood  watches,  these  participants  have proven that community involvement can  make a difference.  Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch participants have bridged culture and language gaps  in the name of collective security. By recognizing  shared  community  values,  Fairfax  County Neighborhood Watch has  facilitated  improved understanding and relations between  individuals from a variety of backgrounds. One  of the greatest assets of neighborhood watch  is its ability to bring neighbors together.  One of the most active branches of the Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch is the Camelot Neighborhood Watch Program, which  is  the oldest continuously active neighborhood  watch in the United States. This highly accomplished  program  serves  as  an  impressive  model for other organizations across the county and nation.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank  the Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch Program for 25 years of dedicated service to its  community. Programs like neighborhood watch  are vital in our efforts to combat crime. I call  upon my colleagues to join me in applauding  the Fairfax County Neighborhood Watch’s past  accomplishments and in wishing the program  continued success in the many years to come.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4850,  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 6, 2004  ",2004
1660,149,2004-10-11,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 4850, the District of Columbia  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005, which  continues to open the door of educational opportunity for the students in our nation’s capital. This measure fully funds the DC School  Choice  Incentive Act which  is  fundamentally  about providing new options and new hope for  students and families trapped in a school system that is struggling to survive.  Since the DC School Choice Incentive Program was enacted in January 2004, the Department of Education conducted a grant competition for the administration of the program  and has awarded the Washington Scholarship  Fund  (WSF)  the  opportunity  to  run  the  groundbreaking new endeavor.  And WSF is off to a strong start. More than  2,680 students applied for scholarships for the  2004–2005 school year, and over 1,840 of  those students met the eligibility requirements  and completed their applications. In the middle  of June, a lottery was held and scholarships  were awarded to 1,360 students. Of the eligible public school students, only 194 public  school students did not receive scholarships  because of the limitation on available space in  grades 6–12.  Currently there are 53 District of Columbia  private, religious and independent schools participating  in  the program  in  the 2004–2005  school year. I am pleased that many of the  scholarship students have chosen  to attend  schools  in  the Center City Consortium—a  group of 13 inner city DC Catholic elementary  schools within the Archdiocese of Washington  located  in  the most  financially  challenged  neighborhoods in the District. These schools  work  to ensure  that Catholic education continues to be available to all city families, and  have enthusiastically begun  to educate over  500 scholarship students.  The WSF  is continuing  its efforts aggressively to make sure families are aware of the  scholarships available  for  the coming school  year. With more time to prepare for this fall,  the program expects more schools to participate  in 2005–2006, more seats  to be available, and more parents to apply.  The strength of this program is that it will  not only benefit individual students and their  families, but the entire education system in the  District of Columbia. Everyone agrees that the  public school system will remain the primary  source of education for a majority of these students. We cannot, and will not, support a proposal that would harm these schools.  My  colleague  from  New  Jersey,  Mr.  has  provided  tremendous  leadership in ensuring that the bill before us  continues to provide new money and new options that offers the neediest students opportunities they never had before, and more importantly, provides both  increased  competition  and an infusion of funding that will help revitalize an entire system and help it to better  serve each and every student.  The bill continues to appropriate substantial  new  funding—and  let’s be clear,  this  is still  new money; we’re not draining a single dollar  from the public school system in the District.  The funding is the full appropriation for the DC  school improvement program—giving $13 million for public school improvements, $13 million for charter schools and $14 million for opportunity scholarships  to promote academic  achievement and school choice.  This measure allows us the opportunity to  make a difference in the lives of students and  families in the District of Columbia. I’m proud  FRELINGHUYSEN,  of the measure before us and grateful for the  work of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN in ensuring  the full appropriation. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in support of students and  families and the entire educational system in  the District of Columbia.  f  PRAISING A. JAY CRISTOL’S BOOK  ‘‘THE LIBERTY INCIDENT’’  HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 7, 2004  ",2004
1661,149,2004-10-11,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to congratulate Judge A. Jay Cristol  of the Southern District of Florida on the completion of his invaluable research on the USS  Liberty  incident. Judge Cristol’s doctoral dissertation details  the  tragedy  that befell  the  U.S. Navy ship USS Liberty  in 1967 when  Israeli aircraft  fired upon  the ship, killing 34  sailors and wounding 171 others.  Judge Cristol’s dogmatic search persuaded  the National Security Agency to release classified transcripts proving that Israel’s attack on  the USS Liberty was an accident.  Judge  Cristol’s research shows the Israeli forces attacked  the American USS Liberty ship because they believed it was an Egyptian ship  firing upon their coastline.  Through his diligent work and dedication,  Judge A. Jay Cristol has assisted in strengthening  the  relationship between  the United  States and  Israel and resolving unanswered  questions about this unfortunate tragedy. I applaud his efforts, and commend him for this  important work.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to  join me in applauding Florida’s Judge A. Jay  Cristol on this important achievement.  f  HOUSE CALLS  HON. CHARLES H. TAYLOR  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 7, 2004  Mr. TAYLOR of North Carolina.

1662,156,2004-10-11,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in strong  support of H.R. 5061 and urge all members to  vote for this important legislation.  I would  like  to  thank Representative TOM  TANCREDO for introducing this important legislation.  I would also  like  to  thank Chairman  and Congressman LANTOS and  their  staffs for moving this legislation swiftly through  committee.  This  legislation could not be more  timely.  Stories and pictures of horrific abuse and suffering in the Darfur region of Sudan are now  on our nightly news. Newspapers are running  daily stories. I visited Sudan in July and witnessed with my own eyes the horrific conditions.  The world has now awakened to this nightmare and we must do everything in our power  to try to stop it.  We must not forget that the conflict in Darfur  has been occurring for the last year and a half  but that there also has been an ongoing war  for the last 20 years between the Government  of Sudan and the mostly Christian South.  Millions of  lives have been  lost. Millions  more are shattered and scarred forever.  Sudan has suffered  from war crimes and  unspeakable human rights abuses. One country, one group of people, should not have to  endure so much suffering.  Sudan is not alone. Africa has seen enormous suffering  this past decade  from  the  butchery that took place in Sierra Leone to the  genocide in Rwanda. We must learn from the  past, learn from the mistakes of our own inaction, and mobilize to try to save lives.  Some 50,000 people are already dead  in  Darfur and more than a million more are at  risk. The world must act now.  The United States took a bold move under  the leadership of Secretary of State Powell by  calling what is occurring in Sudan what it is—  a genocide. Unfortunately  the  international  community has been slow to respond.  H.R. 5061 is based on the fact that genocide is now occurring in Darfur and that the  Government of Sudan  is  complicit  in  this  genocide. Significant pressure must be placed  on the Government of Sudan to both end the  genocide and finalize a comprehensive peace  agreement with the South.  Only  then will  the  innocent civilians, who  have suffered for so long, be able to begin rebuilding their lives.  This bill immediately imposes sanctions on  the Government of Sudan. I think this is sound  policy. We are dealing with a government that  is committing genocide against its own people,  therefore we need to use every possible tool  to apply pressure so that it will stop.  H.R. 5061 also outlines multilateral actions  to press U.N. countries  to apply additional  pressure on Sudan, and most importantly provides much-needed humanitarian aid to Darfur  and humanitarian and development aid to alleviate suffering in the South.  We are beyond the point of merely warning  the Government of Sudan with punitive measures. We must now take action.  The world is watching and rogue regimes in  other nations who have the ability to do this to  their own people are watching how we  respond. Our  response  to genocide must be  firm.  The world will  look back on Darfur  in 10  years and know that the United States stood  firm and the United States stood with the people of Darfur.  I call on every member of Congress to vote  in favor of this important legislation. We must  send a strong message to the Government of  Sudan  that  the United States will not sit by  while they commit genocide.  f  HONORING ALL THOSE  SERVING  NORTHWEST  FLORIDA  IN  THE  AFTERMATH  OF  HURRICANE  IVAN  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 7, 2004  ",2004
1663,156,2004-10-11,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the organizations, businesses,  and people who helped the residents of Northwest Florida get back on their feet during Hurricane Ivan’s aftermath.  The panhandle of Florida was dealt a difficult hand, as Ivan left no life untouched. Undoubtedly once again, Northwest Floridians  have proven  their strength during  times of  devastating destruction and loss.  Returning to our homes to assess the damage, we were  reassured  that we were not  alone and help was on the way. Gulf Power,  Escambia River Electric Cooperative,  local  radio  stations  and  newspapers,  the Red  Cross, FEMA, Army Corps of Engineers, and  the Small Business Administration assisted almost everyone in the community in a variety  of ways; from supplying ice, water, and food,  to emotional support, the spread of information  and monetary funds in the effort to help rebuild. Thanks to these folks, I’m happy to report  that  the  lights are  coming back on,  bridges are mended, roofs are  tarped, businesses are reopening, and naval aviators are  training.  As  for  the Panhandle’s  future,  it’s not  the  character of Northwest Floridians  to give up  hope. Our communities will continue to unite  together, and  rebuild our homes and businesses better and stronger. Our military infrastructure will  rebuild and Pensacola will  remain the Cradle of Naval Aviation. There is no  other place in the world like the panhandle of  Florida and the residents there recognize that  there is no better place to rebuild their lives.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere thanks to all  those, near and far, who have given comfort  and have helped  the  residents of Florida’s  panhandle rebuild their lives.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO TEXAS INSTRUMENTS WORKING MOTHER  MAGAZINE’S  TOP  PLACES  TO  WORK  HON. SAM JOHNSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 7, 2004  ",2004
1664,156,2004-10-11,Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  congratulations are in order for Texas Instruments. For the Ninth Year in a Row—Working  Mother magazine has named Texas  Instruments a best place to work.  It’s an honor to represent the numerous employees at Texas  Instruments who helped  make this achievement possible.  Some would consider Texas Instruments a  trailblazer in the workplace when it comes to  family issues. That’s because they are.  In the early 1990’s, a small team of employees concerned about work and family issues  created the Texas Instruments Work/Life Strategy; an endeavor that has helped shape the  company’s  culture  through  changing  times  with outstanding results.  TI  champions  talented  and  ambitious  women throughout the organization. TI has a  number of very active Women’s Initiatives that  offer a range of speakers and programs  to  help women achieve their full potential in their  careers at TI. Since 1989  representation of  women  in management  job grades has  increased over 450 percent.  New mothers receive eight weeks of paid  maternity leave at TI, and they have a built-in  support network when they return to the job.  TI employees can find help and advice with  work  and  personal  issues  through  the  LifeWorks resource and referral service. And a  Corporate Concierge service can help with everything from party planning, to locating hard-  to-find gifts.  TI employees receive discounts at child care  centers and have access to back-up care and  care for sick children.  TI offers a flexible work environment allowing employees  the opportunity  to effectively  manage their work/life challenges.  Is it any wonder that Texas Instruments is  recognized globally as a great place to work—  by employees and  third parties alike? Congratulations, and I salute all the people at TI  who helped make this accomplishment a reality.  f  A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR A TAX  CREDIT TO AN INDIVIDUAL PURCHASING A GUN SAFE  HON.

1666,163,2004-10-11,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I ask a  very serious question. Why is it, the Cheney-  Bush bunch allow us to import foreign made  flu vaccines, but won’t allow Americans  to  shop  for  American made  cheaper  drugs  across our borders?  We all know the importance of getting our  flu vaccines every year. The Washington Post  reports  that  last year’s  flu season was  the  worst flu season we’ve had in 4 years, and the  flu killed 142 people. As all Americans are  aware, there is another flu vaccine crisis in our  country.  America’s supply of  the  flu vaccine has  practically  been  cut  in  half,  because  the  world’s second-leading supplier, The Chiron  Corp. based  in Britain, was shut down because of contamination reported in its batches  of the vaccine.  48 million vaccines were due to be shipped  before  this  shutdown.  I  repeat, 48 million  doses of this vaccine were to be imported into  this country, to help combat a life-threatening  illness.  Mr. Speaker, I speak to address a glaring  policy inconsistency on the part of the Cheney-Bush administration.  Why is it, that a long-standing health policy,  that is wildly effective and successful, be permitted with respect to one killer, but denied to  every other disease?  142 people died from the flu last year, and  it causes outrage and action. 250,000 people  die from heart attacks before they even get to  the hospital each year, and it’s accepted as  just another statistic.  How many of  these 250,000 could have  been saved,  if only  they’d had medicine  to  lower their cholesterol?  How many of  these 250,000 could have  been saved, if only they’d been able to afford  their medicine?  According  to a recent press release  from  the University of Michigan Health System,  nearly half of patients who have a prescription  for any of the cholesterol-fighting drugs called  statins fail to fill their prescription every time—  or stop filling it altogether! The University goes  on to say that the higher the prescription cost,  the lower the number of prescriptions filled.  Let’s ignore, for a moment, that Europe has  been importing drugs safely and effectively for  over 20 years.  Let us also ignore that countries like Canada,  the United Kingdom, Germany,  and  France also have higher life expectancies and  lower child mortality  rates  than  the United  States does.  But let us not ignore a new FDA proposal.  A proposal that would require customs agents  to return all drugs sent from foreign addresses  back to their senders.  William Hubbard, a senior associate commissioner at the FDA, told Congress on June  7th, ‘‘We need to make a blanket assessment  that  these drugs are not safe  for American  consumers and they should be turned back.’’  Unless, of course, it’s the flu vaccine.  And  then  it’s OK  if  they come  from  the  United Kingdom, as in the case of the Chiron  Corp. Or if it comes from the world’s largest  supplier of the flu vaccine, the French company, Aventis Pasteur.  Yes, there are criticisms about the safety of  imported drugs. One might be able to look to  this most recent flu vaccine scare and say that  this is a perfect example of why we don’t import drugs. The safety of the supply could be  compromised.  I would say that this is a perfect example of  why we should import from countries like Canada or the United Kingdom. They have safeguards in place, just as we do, that protect the  integrity of the prescription drug supply.  On August 12th,  the acting FDA commissioner Lester Crawford expressed his concern  that al-Qaida may attack the supply of drugs  coming into this country.  I will  tell you  that  I am JUST AS CONCERNED about the 28 percent of older adults  with diabetes who, as reported in the February  2004 issue of Diabetes Care, are going without food or other essentials to pay for their insulin.  Why, in the richest nation on Earth, with this  so-called comprehensive new Medicare program, are people going without food to afford  their drugs?  Why is the Administration so opposed to a  program that would help so many?  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge not only the duly  elected Representatives  of  the  citizens  in  these United States, but also the President to  do what is in the best interests of these citizens.  I urge both Congress and the President to  embrace prescription drug re-importation and  reject  the  influence of  the pharmaceutical  companies.  f  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  PERSONAL PROTECTION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 29, 2004  ",2004
1667,163,2004-10-11,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, all  Americans know that gun control continues to  be a serious subject of debate, right here in  the District of Columbia, in the State of Georgia, which I represent, and across this nation.  It’s an issue of personal safety and of constitutional rights embedded in the fabric of our Nation.  I agree with those who want to restrict criminal access  to guns. However,  this must be  done without compromising the constitutional  rights of our law-abiding citizens.  I strongly support  the right of  law-abiding  adults to purchase and own firearms for the  protection of  their homes and  families, collecting,  target shooting, and hunting. That’s  why I have and will continue to oppose any  proposal  that  threatens  this basic Second  Amendment right.  I realize the concerns of some Americans  who,  in  the wake of school shootings and  other heinous illegal acts, call for stricter gun  control measures.  I understand  those concerns. That’s why I fully support measures that  call for tougher sentences for the illegal use of  firearms, to get offenders off the streets and  out of our communities.  I support stiff sentences of juveniles who use firearms illegally,  and I support increasing the maximum penalty  for adults who illegally provide those juveniles  with firearms. That’s how we must keep our  schools and communities safe.  Mr. Speaker, tougher gun laws should not  infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens,  and Congress has both the authority and the  responsibility to ensure that they do not. So,  the question before us today is not whether  Congress can repeal the District of Columbia’s  handgun and self-defense bans, it is whether  Congress should do so. The U.S. Constitution,  the constitutions of 44 States, Federal law, the  laws of all 50 States,  the vast majority of  Georgians and of Americans  recognize  the  right for law abiding citizens to use firearms  for protection, and  for other  legal purposes.  Only the District of Columbia prohibits a person  from having a  firearm assembled and  loaded at home,  for  the purpose of self-defense. I believe that that’s wrong. We should  pass this bill and allow D.C. residents to protect themselves from crime.  f  UNIVERSAL NATIONAL SERVICE  ACT OF 2003  SPEECHOF  HON. RUSH D. HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 5, 2004  ",2004
1668,163,2004-10-11,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk  about a very important subject for the young  people of my district and America, the draft.  This week, the Congress considered H.R. 163,  Universal National Service Act of 2003, which  would require every U.S. citizen, and every  other person residing in the United States, between the ages of 18 and 26 to perform a two-  year period of national service, unless exempted.  Let me make clear, I do not support reinstatement of an active military draft system.  Also it is very unlikely there will be a draft in  the foreseeable future.  The legal authority for drafting men into the  U.S. armed forces expired in 1973. However,  the U.S. Selective Service System has been  registering 18–25  year-olds on a  stand-by  basis. These young men could be called for  service should an active draft ever be reinstated. Currently, women are not required to  register with the U.S. Selective Service.  Young people, as well as  their parents,  across my district have heard about a draft  bill, and these constituents are asking questions about the draft bill and want to find out  its status. Congressman RANGEL and U.S.  Senator FRITZHOLLINGS from South Carolina  introduced this legislation to reinstate an active draft and extend service requirements to  women. I cannot speak for them about their  motives behind this legislation, but they certainly do make a fundamental point: if we go  to war, all Americans should share in the cost  and sacrifice of that war. The authors point out  that without a universal draft, this burden falls  disproportionately on  the  shoulders of  the  poor,  the disadvantaged, and minorities, as  was the case during the Vietnam War.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 163  raises  important  questions about  the current composition of  U.S. armed forces. For example, Representative RANGELargues that among 535 Members  of Congress, only four have sons or daughters  who presently serve in the military.

1669,170,2004-10-11,Mr. HALL.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored today  to  recognize Sherman  Independent School  District’s Reading Recovery program  In 2001, President George W. Bush signed  a landmark law, the No Child Left Behind Act,  which stresses academic achievement for all  students and includes more accountability for  student  results. The Sherman  Independent  School District’s Reading Recovery program  meets and exceeds the standards and guidelines of that law. Reading Recovery is a highly  effective, short-term intervention involving one-  on-one tutoring for low-achieving first graders.  Students  receive  a  half-hour  lesson  each  school day for 12 to 20 weeks with a specially  trained Reading Recovery teacher. As soon as  students demonstrate that they can read within the average range of their classmates, their  lessons are discontinued.  Sherman’s Reading Recovery program is a  big success. At the Reading Recovery site located at Crutchfield Elementary School, students who completed the program passed the  TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and  Skills) test by a rate of 92 percent last year.  The gains made by these students are truly  impressive—they  had  higher  text  reading  gains than their peers, had low levels of placement  in special education classes, and had  high levels of advancement to the next grade  level.  Reading Recovery is precisely the kind of  program our schools need  to advance  the  goals of  the No Child Left Behind  law. Research issued by the U.S. Department of Education finds that students tutored according to  the Reading Recovery model read more proficiently  than 75 percent of  their untutored  peers. This program  is a valuable part of a  comprehensive literacy plan and supplements  good classroom teaching.  On behalf of the students, teachers, and administrators  of  the  Sherman  Independent  School District’s Reading Recovery program, I  want to take this opportunity in the House of  Representatives to commend their successful  efforts to leave no child behind.  f  HONORING LIEUTENANT CHARLES  REINHARDT  HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1670,170,2004-10-11,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Lieutenant Charles Reinhardt for his  years of dedicated service and unwavering  commitment to the police force and the people  of Union City. He is being honored today, October 8, 2004, at a retirement party in Union  City, New Jersey.  From an early age, Lieutenant Reinhardt  took an interest in military and police work. At  the age of 18, he became one of the youngest  officers in the history of the Union City Police  Department when he joined the force as a police special. Three years later, he was sworn  in as an official police officer. As an officer, he  worked in a variety of areas, including traffic,  crime prevention, community policing, and patrol. His  tireless work and solid  leadership  skills earned him the rank of Lieutenant, also  serving  for a short  time as  the unit’s commander and as a supervisor. He became one  of the first Hispanic police sergeants in Union  City and was the first Puerto Rican Lieutenant  on the force.  Known  for his attendance of  community  events, Lieutenant Reinhardt made great efforts to reach out to the citizens of Union City,  particularly the Hispanic community. His passion and hard work have been acknowledged  by numerous groups, including the American  Federation of Police,  the American Law Enforcement Officers Association,  the Hispanic  Law Enforcement Officers Association of Hudson County, the Union City Police Department,  and the American Police Hall of Fame.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Lieutenant Charles Reinhardt for almost  three decades of selfless service  to  Union City and its residents. The passion and  commitment he demonstrated  throughout his  career and  for his community made him an  important member of the police force.  f  TRIBUTE TO WES KEUSDER ON  THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT AS PRESIDENT OF THE  BUILDING  INDUSTRY  ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  HON. KEN CALVERT  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1671,170,2004-10-11,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay tribute to Wes Keusder, who has been a  dedicated, strong and effective voice for the  principles and  ideals of California’s building  community during his years as a member and  leader of the Building Industry Association of  Southern California (BIA/SC). Riverside County and all of southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community  leaders who willingly and unselfishly  give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Wes  is one of these individuals. On November 5,  2004, Wes will be honored by BIA at  their  38th Annual Awards and Installation Dinner.  Wes Keusder  is a  third generation home  builder in California and has worked for over  twenty years to make homeownership a reality  for thousands of California’s families. Wes followed  in  the  footsteps of his  father, Walter  Keusder Jr., and grandfather, Walter Keusder,  by serving as President of BIA/SC as well as  participating in the California Building Industry  Association and  the National Association of  Home Builders. Wes has demonstrated exemplary leadership and service to the building industry by serving as the President of the BIA  Riverside County Chapter in 2001 and 2002.  Additionally, Wes served as a Director of the  Building Industry Legal Defense Fund, whose  mission is to defend the rights of home and  property owners.  Homeownership is an American dream, and  housing is a community asset which strengthens  the  fabric of neighborhoods. Wes has  worked tirelessly to ensure that thousands of  Californians can make  that dream a reality.  His passion and service  for homeownership  has  improved Riverside and all of Southern  California. Wes Keusder has earned my many  thanks and I wish him great success in all his  future endeavors.  f  PENSION FAIRNESS ACT OF 2004  HON. GEORGE MILLER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1672,170,2004-10-11,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.," Mr.  Speaker, today I have introduced the Pension  Fairness Act to bring some equity to bear between corporate executives and rank-and-file  workers when those executives seek to dump  underfunded workers’ pension plans onto the  Federal Government or  cut older workers’  pensions through an unfair cash balance plan  conversion.  Far too often, we hear of cases where executives demand concessions from their workers when the business struggles and, at the  same  time, sweeten  their own pension and  deferred compensation deals.  It’s past  time  that executives understand  that  the pension  promises made  to  their workers are sacred.  It’s past time that executives understand that  a  breach  of  those  promises  carries  consequences. Employees cannot be asked  to  absorb the full brunt of bankruptcy by having  their pension plans terminated and dropped on  the Federal Government. Executives should  share in that pain.  When  companies  terminate  their  underfunded pension plans,  the  federally established Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  (PBGC) takes over those liabilities. Today, the  PBGC suffers  from a $10 billion deficit. Already in bankruptcy, United Airlines, which recently defied the law and stopped making legally-required  contributions  to  its  pension  plans, would add $6.4 billion to the PBGC’s  obligations  if  the  company  terminates  its  plans. United’s workers and  retirees would  lose $1.9 billion  in earned pension benefits.  US Airways has asked a bankruptcy court for  permission to skip a $110 million contribution  to its pension plans, due last month. Plan terminations at these companies would pose serious threats not just to the retirement security  of their employees but to the retirement security of other airlines’ employees and to the ongoing solvency of the PBGC. When executives  are faced with the choice between terminating  or saving company pension plans  they also  should have a stake in that choice.  In recent years, we have seen companies  break  their pension promises by converting  their  traditional pension plans  into cash balance plans. Many of  these conversions do  wonders for a company’s books—to the great  delight of executives and directors—but end  up cutting older workers’ pension benefits.  Many of these conversions have given workers no choice between the cash balance and  traditional pension plans. Just  last year, a  court found that the cash balance conversion  at  IBM, which all employees were  forced  to  take, would result in a 47 percent reduction in  older workers’ pensions. The Government Accountability Office found similar losses of up to  50 percent of older workers’ promised pensions.

1673,177,2004-10-11,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life and achievements of an extraordinary  man, Charles  ‘‘Chuck’’ Johnson of Oakland,  California. Chuck was a prominent  figure  in  the  communications  industry  for  over  40  years, and worked  tirelessly  in  that capacity  not only to promote equality and social justice,  but to keep print and broadcast media affordable and accessible  to all. Chuck passed  away on July 27, 2004 after succumbing  to  cancer, and  is survived by his son, Charles  Johnson, Jr.  Chuck was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 21, 1938. After growing up in Missouri,  he began his career in radio in 1956. He later  joined the Air Force, and following his service  time, returned to working full time in the entertainment industry, where he would become the  first African American to reach several technological and professional milestones. In 1959,  Chuck  created  the  first Black  teen dance  show, and in the early 1960s, became the first  African American not only to host a #1 nightly  Top 40 radio show, but also to buy and sell  FM  radio stations.  In 1966, he began producing  the  nationally  syndicated SoulTime  USA, and would move on to establish the first  Black movie distribution company to promote  major Black movies.  In 1978, he would become the first African American to operate a  24-hour commercial  lease access  television  station, the Soulbeat Television Network, airing music videos and community programming  in Oakland. Soulbeat is presently celebrating  22 years of continuous programming, and has  not only added live interactive talk shows to its  programming lineup, but in 1998 became the  first network ever  to broadcast  full-time  live  streaming  television  to  the world over  the  internet.  In addition  to  the pioneering  role Chuck  played in the communications industry, he was  an active member of the civil rights movement  throughout his life. He not only served as the  president of  the  local NAACP Chapter  in  Southern California in the 1960s, but as the  West Coast Chapter President of the National  Association of Television and Radio Announcers, was a leader in the movement to hire the  first Black radio announcers in Los Angeles.  Furthermore, his founding of Soulbeat in Oakland was historic not only because he was the  first African American to establish such a station, but because Soulbeat was and continues  to be a vehicle for the advancement of free  speech and social equality.  On August 2, 2004, Chuck’s  friends and  family gathered to honor his extraordinary life  and the impact that his work had on the lives  of those around him. Chuck was a truly unique  individual not only because of  the record of  historic achievements that marked his career,  but because of his commitment to using his  voice to improve the lives of the people in his  community and beyond. His legacy will continue far into the future, and his memory will  be treasured by all who knew him. The Ninth  Congressional District salutes Chuck Johnson  for the contributions he made to Oakland, the  East Bay, and our entire country.  HONORING  LINDA  WHITE-EPPS  FOR  HER  LIFETIME  OF  OUTSTANDING SERVICE  HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1674,177,2004-10-11,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with a  heavy heart and great admiration that I rise  today to pay tribute to an exceptional woman  whose endless energy and dedication touched  the lives of all who knew her and many who  did not.  It has been one year since Linda  White-Epps was taken from her family, friends,  and community after a long and courageous  battle with breast cancer. A tireless advocate  and  inspiring  soul,  Linda’s message  of  strength and support continues through the organization she founded, Sister’s Journey.  After losing an aunt as well as another significant person in her life to cancer and being  diagnosed with breast cancer herself, Linda  made it her life’s purpose to ensure that no  woman be  ‘‘alone’’  in  the battle with breast  cancer. Linda always held a strong belief in  the importance of sharing her story with others—to hide it was to allow the disease to win.  She began Sister’s Journey, a support group  for women of color surviving breast cancer.  She went on to create an annual calendar with  each month highlighting  the story of a survivor. The calender serves a tangible and visible  source  of  encouragement—sending  a  message of hope to other woman striving for  survivorship.  I had many opportunities to work with Linda  over the years and I was always in awe of her  constant energy and unwavering commitment  to her cause. She strongly believed  in  the  need for awareness, education, and outreach  to  those diagnosed with breast cancer and  their loved ones. Linda brought the battle to  the community and to Washington. The American Cancer Society was just one of the many  organizations for which Linda volunteered her  time. In fact, she served as a lobbyist for the  organization  in Washington, highlighting  the  concerns of Connecticut and making sure legislators knew just how vital increased funding  for research and education are—not only  to  those fighting breast cancer, but for those who  had survived as well. Linda was also responsible  for organizing  the  first Relay  for Life  event  in Hamden, Connecticut—now an annual event that serves as one of the largest  fundraisers for the American Cancer Society.  Linda’s accomplishments and advocacy did  not go unrecognized. Throughout her life she  was honored with a myriad of awards and acknowledgments. Perhaps the most prestigious  of these many accolades was when Linda was  recognized with the ‘‘Points of Light Award’’ in  2002. Bestowed by the President of the United  States, this special honor celebrates the success of volunteers and highlights the impact  that individuals have on their communities. For  Linda, this was a most fitting tribute. Her efforts have left an indelible mark on our community and one cannot say enough about the  difference she has made in the lives of others.  This year marks the 6th Anniversary of the  ‘‘Pink Tea’’, an annual ‘‘Celebration of Survivorship,’’ where the Sister’s Journey Calendar  has  traditionally been unveiled. This year’s  event will indeed be special as members remember Linda’s efforts and honor her memory  by continuing her work. I am proud to join her  mother, Phyllis White; her children, Dawn and  George; her grandchildren, Dominique and  Donvan;  family,  friends, and  colleagues  in  honoring Linda White-Epps for her outstanding  service and  invaluable contributions  to our  community. Linda’s legacy will continue to inspire and support those most in need.  f  HONORING JOHN BURTON  HON. NANCY PELOSI  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1675,177,2004-10-11,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, with great  respect, admiration, and affection, I am honored  to salute John Burton for 40 years of fighting  for human  rights and social  justice  for  the  American people. John has been my mentor,  my ally, and my dear friend for many years  and throughout my time in Congress. Although  term limits have now led John to continue his  fight in new arenas, his leadership as President pro tempore of the California State Senate will long be recognized as a powerful force  in the fight against poverty and in the fight for  fairness for all.  The Burton name has occupied a revered  place  in California politics  for decades, and  John has served with great  integrity  in  the  Congress and in the California State Legislature. The vast  landscape of John Burton’s  leadership  includes  legislative successes  to  protect our workers, to provide health care to  all,  to ensure equal  rights  for minorities,  to  preserve our environment, and  to  improve  education. That landscape has been shaped  by his intellect, his conviction, his humor, his  sensitivity, and his ability  to capture hearts,  even those of his opponents.  One of John’s  first acts upon returning  to  the state legislature was to introduce a bill outlawing poverty. This was typical Burton style—  deep caring mixed with a brash reminder of  our Nation’s core value to care for those in  greatest need.  John displayed  this  fundamental commitment  to  justice recently when  he  spoke at a Building and Construction  Trades Convention and stated, ‘‘It is up to you  and me and others like us to make sure that  when people are asking for a job, that job has  decent wages, decent working conditions, and  decent benefits and that workers get their fair  share of the wealth of this Nation. It’s the just  thing to do, it’s due you, and we’re going to  help you fight to get what is your due.’’  Sadly,  John’s  political  career  has  been  marked by  tragedy—the  loss of his brother,  Congressman Philip Burton, at the early age  of 56 and the assassination of one of his dearest  friends, San Francisco Mayor George  Moscone at age 49. On the murder of Mayor  Moscone,  John  wrote:  ‘‘Those  senseless  events brought me  face  to  face with grief,  making me realize  that  friends are precious  and life is all too short. We should remember  to take time from our own activities to spend  more  time with  those we care about, rather  than so totally immerse ourselves in our jobs  and businesses that we are always too busy  to relate to people.’’  John’s life has also been marked by great  fulfillment—not only  in his  illustrious political  career, but also  in his  family  life.

1676,184,2004-10-11,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor Chief Larry Lewis of the Alhambra Police Department. Chief Lewis is a 35-year veteran of California Law Enforcement having  served in five municipal police agencies. Chief  Lewis began his distinguished career as a police cadet in West Covina, CA.  As  the police  chief  for Alhambra, Larry  Lewis has been an exemplary leader in working with his department to strengthen its application of the community policing philosophy as  well as the department’s commitment to ethical and professional behavior. He has instituted effective review procedures of police use  of force and vehicle pursuits and introduced  less  lethal weapons and  in-vehicle camera  systems into department operations. In 2003,  as a result of Chief Lewis’ efforts, the department replaced its aging information technology  system resulting  in a new records management and computer aided dispatch system,  mobile data computers in police vehicles, and  mapping system as well as  improved crime  analysis abilities.  An active member of the community, Larry  Lewis has  served on  several professional  boards as well as community service associations such as Rotary  International and  the  YMCA. He has taught and lectured on topics  of police use of force, sexual harassment prevention, supervision, executive leadership and  community policing.  In addition, Chief Lewis  served as the 2002 president of the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs Association,  representing 46 municipal law enforcement agencies in the county.  Chief Lewis received a bachelor of arts degree in political science and masters in public  administration from California State University,  Fullerton as well as a masters of science degree in management from Cal Poly University,  Pomona. He is a graduate of the POST Command College, returning as a presenter during  class orientations.  Known  for  his  charisma  and  sense  of  humor, Chief Lewis  is a popular master of  ceremonies for various community and charity  events.  Chief Lewis celebrates 32 years of marriage  to his wife, Irene in 2004. They enjoy family  outings with their son, Steve, and daughter-in-  law, Penny.  I ask all Members of Congress to join me  today in congratulating Alhambra Police Chief  Larry Lewis on an impressive and long spanning career in law enforcement.  f  HONORING ALLEN TEMPLE  BAPTIST CHURCH  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1677,184,2004-10-11,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Allen Temple Baptist Church of Oakland, California for 85 years of ministry and invaluable  service to the community. Since its founding,  Allen Temple has been a pillar of strength and  leadership, and its tireless efforts have had a  dramatic  impact not only on  the  lives of  its  members, but on the entire Oakland and East  Bay community.  Allen Temple Baptist Church began as 85th  Avenue Baptist Church in 1919. The church  was organized by  the Reverend J.L. Allen,  and was one of  the  first primarily African-  American congregations in East Oakland. During the first several years following its establishment, 85th Avenue Baptist Church struggled  to survive. However,  the congregation  gradually became stronger, and after moving  to its current location on 85th Avenue, was renamed in 1927 in honor of its founder. In the  years that followed, Allen Temple not only expanded its membership, but also began establishing the first of the many community service  programs for which it is now known.  Allen Temple’s current Pastor, a great and  magnificent  servant of God, Dr.  J. Alfred  Smith, Sr., was installed as the church’s leader in 1969, and brought with him the sense of  energy and direction that would serve not only  to rejuvenate the church’s existing programs,  but to initiate several new ones. The Pastoral  Staff was organized, which not only increased  the scope and effectiveness of  the church’s  operations, but which today has grown to include over a dozen ministries. In the decades  that followed, Allen Temple’s presence within  the community would become even stronger  as it continued to establish initiatives such as  the Allen Temple Baptist Church Federal  Credit Union, the senior and disabled housing  facilities at Allen Temple Arms I-III, the Radio  Ministry, and the Allen Temple Hispanic Ministry. In addition, the church went onto establish  the Allen Temple Community Outreach  Center, the Allen Temple Family Life Center,  the Leadership  Institute, and Allen Temple  Manor, a 24-unit building of affordable housing  for persons who are disabled due  to HIV/  AIDS.  In recent years, Allen Temple’s involvement  has become increasingly vital in the support  and guidance of individuals recently released  from prison, and those who are HIV positive or  living with AIDS. The Dr. J. Alfred Smith, Sr.  Training Academy provides job training to dozens of parolees each year. The Allen Temple  AIDS Ministry works to provide spiritual support and essential medical and social services  to those living with HIV and AIDS, and works  with  the Alameda County AIDS  Interface  to  make these services more widely available.  On October 17, 2004, Allen Temple Baptist  Church will celebrate its 85-year anniversary  in Oakland, California.  I would  like  to honor  this occasion by commending the church for  the vital role it has played not only as a great  religious institution, but for the indispensable  social and human services and support it provides to the people of Oakland. By setting the  standard of service and commitment for institutions of  faith and community  improvement  throughout its 85 years of ministry, Allen Temple has contributed immeasurably to the Oakland community, our country, and the world.  On behalf of the Ninth Congressional District,  I salute and congratulate Allen Temple Baptist  church on the occasion of its 85th anniversary.  HONORING KATHI MCDONNELL-  BISSELL  HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1678,184,2004-10-11,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker, earlier  this  year, the Town of Milford, CT lost one of its  strongest  advocates  for  seniors  in  Kathi  McDonnell-Bissell when she  lost her battle  with kidney disease brought on by diabetes.  This month, residents and city leaders gathered  to honor Kathi’s memory by dedicating  the newest addition to the Milford Senior Center in her honor. I am proud to stand today to  join them in paying tribute to Kathi whose tireless efforts made such a difference in the lives  of so many.  Senior centers play a vital role in our communities and this is especially true of the Baldwin Senior Center. All too often, what are supposed  to be one’s  ‘‘golden years’’ are  filled  with struggles. Health concerns,  increasing  health care costs, the loss of independence—  these are just some of the challenges our seniors face. Perhaps even more devastating is  the sense of loneliness that can come as one  moves through their later years. Providing invaluable programs and services, senior centers make a  real difference  in  the  lives of  some of our most vulnerable citizens. That is  why they are so important to our seniors and  our communities. Kathi recognized this need  and, under her leadership, what began as a  small office in the basement the Mary Taylor  United Methodist Church has grown into one  of the most respected seniors centers in the  State, boasting over 4,000 active members.  Kathi served as the Senior Center’s Executive Director for over 30 years—even her declining health could not dissuade her  from  continuing efforts to improve the quality of life  for Milford’s seniors. I had the remarkable opportunity  to work with Kathi on a variety of  projects over the years and was constantly in  awe of her endless energy, compassion, and  drive. She was one of the most dedicated individuals I have ever had the privilege of knowing, dedicating not only her career, but much  of her own time to creating a Senior Center  which was a resource for area seniors as well  as a source of pride for the community. While  it will be the last of such examples, the completion of  the new  ten  thousand squarefoot,  two-story addition to the Senior Center is a reflection of Kathi’s dedication and commitment  to providing  for  the ever-changing needs of  her community’s seniors.  For her outstanding an unparalleled service,  I am proud to stand today to join her husband,  Robert;  her  children, Suzanne, Amy,  and  Betsy; family, friends, colleagues, and community leaders in paying tribute to Kathi McDonnell-Bissell. Her  lifetime of generosity has  touched the lives of thousands and left an indelible mark on the Milford community. Kathi  was an extraordinary woman whom I consider  myself  fortunate  to have called my  friend.  Though she will be missed by many, I believe  her legacy will continue to inspire all of those  who knew her—serving as an example to us  all of what a community advocate should be.

1679,198,2004-10-11,Mr. FOLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the Diageo Spirit of  America Fund and its efforts during the recent  devastating hurricanes that hit Florida in August and September. As we Floridians have  dealt with the aftermath of these storms, it became apparent  that  the most precious commodity needed to jumpstart the road to recovery was electricity. Without this precious commodity, our relief workers were left literally in  the dark to sort out what steps needed to be  made to restore order, security, and normalcy  to our devastated state.  Recognizing this need and even before either Hurricane Charley or Frances made landfall, Diageo was poised to help our cause by  bringing four giant portable generators to the  areas most likely in each storm’s path. These  generators were made available to relief workers in St. Lucie County and throughout each  storm’s most devastated areas.  Diageo’s generosity and unique  foresight  helped us  literally  jumpstart our move down  the road toward recovery. Diageo’s generators  were first put to task by providing power to operate Hardee County’s only solid waste facility,  a facility critical to public health in crisis situations. Two additional generators were used to  power a local campground being used as a  temporary shelter for displaced families.  In my district, Diageo helped us after Hurricane Frances by supplying one of these generators to power the Port St. Lucie pumping  station, sending safe drinking water  to  the  homes and shelters of over 88,000 residents  of Port St. Lucie and  the surrounding area.  Water usage was restored to my constituents  much faster than in hurricanes of the past because of the Diageo Spirit of America efforts.  The others were used at the will of the Fort  Pierce Emergency Operations Center wherever the need was greatest  This assistance effort is part of Diageo’s ongoing humanitarian efforts. In the hours and  days after 9/11 Diageo and its employees provided numerous  relief activities and assistance. In December 2001, Diageo brought the  first corporate humanitarian airlift to war-torn  Afghanistan by delivering more than 100,000  pounds of  food and emergency supplies  to  800 orphans in Kabul. In June of 2003, the  company chartered a DC–8 plane and brought  a cargo of food, medicine and school supplies  to Baghdad, becoming the first American company to embark upon a humanitarian mission  into Iraq. In November, Diageo provided more  than 12,000 turkeys to the Connecticut Food  Bank so  that 72,000 disadvantaged  families  could celebrate a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. And this past June, the Diageo Spirit of  the Americas Airlift brought in and distributed  emergency supplies  to  flood victims  in Haiti  and the Dominican Republic. Diageo’s Spirit of  America Humanitarian Aid Missions are facilitated by  the Bridge Foundation, a nonprofit  humanitarian aid and development organization which provides humanitarian aid worldwide. Diageo is the world’s largest total beverage alcohol company.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in thanking Diageo North America and its Spirit of America Fund for its rapid response to the  crisis created by these hurricanes. Their on-  going generosity and understanding of this crisis and these others throughout the world represent  the  finest and most compassionate  qualities in America.  f  HONORING THE NATIONAL DAY OF  THE  REPUBLIC  OF  CHINA  ON  TAIWAN  HON.

1680,198,2004-10-11,Mr. EVERETT.," Mr. Speaker, on October 10,  the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan  celebrate their national day. I join with my colleagues here  in  the House  in congratulating  them on this solemn and happy occasion.  The United States and Taiwan have a long  history of friendship and a tradition of democracy which bind our two nations. Despite the  lack of  formal diplomatic  relations between  Taiwan and America, our economic, political,  and military  ties are strong and continue  to  grow.  For decades,  rights  afforded  freedom and  individual  Taiwan’s  citizens  have  the  to  shown as a beacon in the darkness to the millions of oppressed Chinese citizens across the  Taiwan Straits. Taiwan  is a model  for  the  mainland on many fronts, from its growing democracy to its robust economy.  I am proud to say that the United States has  always been an uncompromising partner with  Taiwan, making sure  that our ally has  the  means to defend its democracy in the event of  attack  from mainland China. While peace  in  the Taiwan Straits has been fragile at times,  the people of Taiwan continue  to stand  tall  and firmly committed to their freedom.  I salute  their courage and strength and  know that the American people join with them  in celebrating this important anniversary of liberty and democracy in East Asia.  f  HONORING ROBERT J.

1681,198,2004-10-11,Ms. MCCARTHY of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  today  to honor our  ‘‘Homegrown Hero,’’  Robert J. Mann. As the founder and executive  director of Bridging the Gap Inc., Bob is being  honored by  the organization on October 15,  2004,  for his  leadership and  vision which  transformed greater Kansas City  into a collaborative and  interconnected community of  environmental awareness, advocacy and reformation.  Thirteen years ago, Bob created Bridging  the Gap, an environmental movement of volunteers who created and maintain our first 15  local community recycling centers. It has since  grown  into a  regional, multifaceted environmental movement involving businesses, governments, schools and  thousands of volunteers. Under Bob’s leadership all segments of  the greater Kansas City community have become interconnected and established partnerships working together to make a difference  and improve Kansas City’s quality of life, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. During a decade of creating change for  a healthier community, Bridging the Gap succeeded in educating the public through environmental publications and speakers bureaus,  hosting special green events for environmental  awareness and advocacy, and ballot initiatives  that brought curbside recycling to Kansas City.  I have been an ardent supporter of Earth  Day  since  the  first one  in 1970, when  I  showed my support by bicycling to my job as  a schoolteacher and discussing with my students the responsibility each individual has to  our global environment. Since 1997 my Earth  Day celebration has come to include Bridging  the Gap’s Earth Day Walk, an eagerly anticipated annual celebration and  fundraiser  for  more  than 1,000 Kansas Citians. More  than  5,000 area residents attend the Party for the  Planet at the Kansas City Zoo, another Earth  Day event sponsored by Bridging the Gap.  Bridging  the Gap  Inc. has grown dynamically and now includes: RecycleFirst, Kansas  City’s curbside  recycling education program;  Keep Kansas City beautiful, a beautification  project involving more than 7,700 volunteers  for 165 metro wide cleanups; Kansas City  Wildlands, a natural and wild places restoration and conservation project; Environmental  Excellence Business Network, an education  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:50 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09OC8.300 E11PT1 ",2004
1682,205,2004-10-11,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to the memory of Thomas Laubacher,  community leader and elected official from my  district who passed away September 26 at the  age of 91.  Tom Laubacher was a native son of Ventura  County, California, having been born to a pioneering Oxnard  family on August 29, 1913.  During his life, Tom Laubacher was a farmer  on his  family’s 150–acre  farm,  located between Doris Avenue and Teal Club Road; an  oilman  for Union Oil Company; and a B–26  pilot instructor for the U.S. Army Air Corps.  In 1954 he took over Laubacher Insurance  Agency and Real Estate, which his father had  founded  in 1903.  It  remains  in  the  family  today.  Tom  Laubacher’s  son,  Thomas  Laubacher, Jr., now runs the business.  In 1964, Tom Laubacher ran for the Board  of Supervisors for the same reason I ran for  the Simi Valley City Council 15 years later: a  belief  that  the business community needed  better  representation  in  government.  He  served  three  terms on  the Board of Supervisors and I had the privilege of serving with  him on the Regional Sanitation Board about  25 years ago.  Integrity  is  the word most associated with  his public service, his business dealings and  his community work.  A devout Catholic—his Uncle John was the  first assistant pastor at Santa Clara Parish—  Tom was a member of Oxnard Council 750 of  the Knights of Columbus and served as the  grand knight and district deputy. In 2002, he  received the cardinal’s award in recognition of  a lifetime of service to his church and community.  Tom Laubacher also maintained a long relationship with  the Sisters of Mercy and St.  John’s Regional Medical Center. He became  the first lay member of its board of directors  and later the board’s first lay president.  Tom Laubacher is survived by his wife of 60  years, Helen,  four children and 17 grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me  in sending our condolences to Helen ‘‘Holly’’  Laubacher,  their children and grandchildren,  and pause in remembering a man for whom  integrity was a way of life. Godspeed, Tom.  f  9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. NITA M. LOWEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 7, 2004  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 10) to provide for  reform of the intelligence community, terrorism prevention and prosecution, border  security, and international cooperation and  coordination, and for other purposes:  ",2004
1683,205,2004-10-11,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Chairman, 3 months ago,  the bipartisan September 11 Commission provided Congress with 41 recommendations to  help keep our Nation secure and our people  safe in the face of rising dangers and threats  throughout the world.  These  recommendations were  targeted at  eliminating  terrorist  organizations,  at  preventing the continued growth of fundamentalist  Islamic  terrorism, and at protecting against  and preparing for future attacks.  In my judgment, the 9/11 Commission report  should have made our job easy. But instead,  we find ourselves faced with a bill that dangerously  ignores some of  the Commission’s  most  important  recommendations, and adds  hundreds of pages of extraneous and controversial provisions that may do little or nothing to better secure our nation.  Let me be clear. I do support the bill’s provisions  that  identify  the  target  terrorist sanctuaries; that focus U.S. efforts on some of the  most critical parts of the world in the war on  terrorism, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia;  and that reform the homeland security grant  process to ensure that higher threat cities receive more funds.  I’d like to emphasize that last point.  As  I  travel  through my District and New  York State, what I hear most from police officers and firefighters is that we need to change  the funding formula to ensure that areas facing  the highest  threats—like New York—will  get the increased funding need to face those  threats head-on. We don’t have another 3  years to get this done—it needs to get done  now. As long as a State like Wyoming gets  seven times the amount of funding that New  York receives, changing  the  funding  formula  must be this Congress’s priority.  I believe this bill makes important changes  to the funding formula and I am proud to have  helped to craft a number of these provisions  and to serve on the committee that guided the  bill through the legislative process.  But, unfortunately, I have serious objections  to many other provisions included in this bill  that do not have anything  to do with  intelligence  reform and other 9/11 Commission  recommendations.  In my  judgment,  there are more effective  and efficient ways of protecting our national  security without infringing on the rights or civil  liberties of our Nation’s citizens and  immigrants.  While  the 9/11 Commission  report made  several recommendations regarding border security and immigration policy, it did not call for  the undermining of the due process rights of  many  immigrants by significantly expending  expedited deportation  laws;  raising  the bar  substantially for a grant of asylum; or authorizing the government to deport foreign nationals to countries that lack a functioning government—or worse—condone and permit torture.  And, while the 9/11 Commission report recommended that we improve FBI counterintelligence capabilities, it did not recommend that  Congress allow the government to secretly investigate an individual suspected of terrorism  without having  to prove  that person  is connected to a foreign power.  And finally, while the 9/11 Commission Report called for federal standards for identification documents, including drivers’ licenses, it  did not recommend that immigrants should be  denied a driver’s license.  While I do believe that the Federal Government should have a role in helping States to  coordinate efforts to strengthen the security of  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:50 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09OC8.330 E11PT1 ",2004
1684,212,2004-10-11,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my great pleasure  to congratulate Macomb  Community College in Macomb County, Michigan on 50 years of educating some of Michigan’s finest citizens. As a former student of  Macomb,  I have experienced  first hand,  the  caliber of people associated with the college.  It has been wonderful  to watch Macomb  Community College expand its programs and  campuses over the years. With only 84 students enrolled  in  its  first year, Macomb has  grown tremendously since its opening in 1954.  Not only does the school offer precollege programs  for high school students,  it also provides more than 40 bachelor’s degree completion and graduate degree programs.  Perhaps what is most impressive, however,  about Macomb Community College, is its incredible partnership with the community. The  Public Service Institute at Macomb strives not  only to educate its citizens, but to equip them  to serve the community with their respective  skills. Classes I completed, such as marketing  and speech, have certainly aided me during  my years in public office.  I have formerly returned to Macomb to take  additional classes, and had the same wonderful experiences. Though the school has grown,  the quality and excellence remain the same. I  know that in the coming years, Macomb Community College will continue to enrich the lives  of  its students as well as members of  the  community.  Congratulations to Macomb Community College on 50 of years of excellence in education  and service to Macomb County. May you be  persistent in your commitment to higher learning and social improvement.  f  HONORING A FALLEN HERO  HON.

1685,212,2004-10-11,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, colleagues,  and friends, my congressional district experienced a great deal of pain and sadness as the  City of Rome lost one of its finest residents—  a young soldier, Sgt. Michael Uvanni. He paid  the ultimate price  to ensure our  liberty. He  gave his life so that the people of Iraq could  live without repression and fear—and he gave  his life so that Americans could feel safe to  live  their  lives under a blanket of  freedom.  That freedom comes with a high price and we  are eternally grateful  for his dedication and  commitment to the ideals that we hold dear.  Sgt. Uvanni died October 1  in Samarra,  Iraq, as he was conducting combat operations  and was shot by a sniper. Uvanni was assigned to the Army National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, Morrisonville,  NY.  Sgt. Uvanni meant so much to the close-knit  community of Rome, NY. He was a fine son  and soldier, as well as a standout  football  player at Rome Free Academy. Sgt. Uvanni  earned special honors  in 1995 as a senior,  being named as a conference second  team  all-star defensive end.  An outgoing and patriotic young man, Sgt.  Uvanni personified the qualities and dedication  that make our United States military the greatest armed  forces  in  the world. Sgt. Uvanni  completed a tour with the U.S. Marines, and  joined  the  local National Guard earlier  this  year. Army Guard CSM Frank Wicks said,  ‘‘While I am sure he will always be a Marine  at heart . . . In January he joined the local  National Guard and was deployed with  the  2nd Battalion 108th Infantry, New York Army  National Guard.  I am sure he was an outstanding Marine, I can attest to the fact that  he was an outstanding member of the 2–108th  and will be missed.’’ As Sgt. Uvanni is laid to  his  final  rest, we salute him, and all  those  killed in the line of duty, for their selfless service and ultimate sacrifice.  I ask my colleagues in the House, and all  Americans,  to extend our prayers and sympathy to his parents Kevin and Janet Uvanni,  as well as the rest of his family and friends,  and the entire Rome community.  Together we honor  this  fallen American  hero.  f  RETIREMENT OF ALLEN J.  WELTMANN  HON. MICHAEL G. OXLEY  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1686,212,2004-10-11,Mr. OXLEY.," Mr. Speaker, we  reach  the  close of the 108th Congress, I rise to note the  retirement of Allen J. Weltmann after 39 years  of service to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Allen is  a Certified Public Accountant and joined the  legacy  firm of Coopers & Lybrand  in 1965  after  graduating  from  Penn  State.  Price  Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand merged  in 1998.  Allen began his career as an auditor in Syracuse before moving on to Philadelphia and  New York. He started the firm’s first government affairs unit in 1978 and has been one of  the accounting profession’s principal spokespersons  in  the public policy arena  for 20  years. In that role I have worked with him on  several landmark pieces of securities legislation,  including  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 and  the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

JOE KNOLLENBERG  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1687,212,2004-10-11,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to congratulate a constituent of mine,  Hayes Wendell Jones. This year marks  the  40th anniversary of his gold medal victory in  the 1964 Summer Olympics. Since then, Mr.  Jones has succeeded in business and been a  dedicated servant to our community.  Hayes Jones went to Pontiac, MI, schools  and became a  student athlete at Eastern  Michigan University. To help pay his way  through  college,  he mopped  floors  and  washed dishes. As an athlete, he was considered too short for hurdles, but through hard  work and determination, Hayes became a  worldclass track sprinter and hurdler. In 1960  at the Rome Summer Olympic Games, he finished  third  to win  the bronze medal. Four  years  later,  in 1964 at  the Tokyo Summer  Olympic Games, Hayes won the gold medal in  the 110-meter hurdles.  There is no question that Hayes Jones is a  track and field legend. He is a member of the  Helms Athletic Hall of Fame in Los Angeles;  the Michigan Hall of Fame; the Eastern Michigan Athletic Hall of Fame; the National Track  and Field Hall of Fame; and the Pontiac Central High School Hall of Fame.  Hayes has also been successful  in business, using his athletic experience  to  learn  about different cultures and backgrounds. He  understands that good business is really about  building and maintaining good  relationships.  He  is currently a Senior Business Development Representative  for Oakland County,  Michigan. As an Oakland County resident,  I  can say we are lucky to have him serving the  county.  Hayes should also be  recognized  for his  selfless  acts  to  the  community. He  has  parlayed his athletic and business success  into community service. He serves as chair of  the volunteer committee of the Arts League of  Michigan and is on the board of directors for  Dominican High School and Academy in Detroit. He is former board chair of the Pontiac  Chamber of Commerce and former economic  development committee chair for the Oakland  County Business Roundtable and the Pontiac  Area Urban  League.  In  addition,  he  has  served on the board of trustees for North Oakland Medical Center and  the Clinton Valley  Boy Scouts.  Hayes has even donated his gold medal to  the city of Pontiac, MI, to inspire youngsters to  achieve their dreams. He has given them the  opportunity by organizing a track and field program, ‘‘The Junior Olympics,’’ for students in  Pontiac middle schools. Just as  importantly,  he has worked to ensure their education by  serving as a school board member  for  the  Pontiac School District.

1688,219,2004-10-11,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I rise  in  memory of Madge Jennings Overhouse to recognize her  lifelong achievements and  indisputable  legacy of selfless volunteerism and  dedication to public service. Madge Jennings  Overhouse was born on July 29, 1924 in The  Dalles, Oregon, and soon moved to San Jose.  She attended San Jose State University, graduating cum  laude  in history, where she met  her husband, a member of both the football  and  track  teams. Madge married Howard  Overhouse  in 1949, and  they had one son,  Richard, and three lovely grandchildren, Ashley Ann, Katie and Will Overhouse.  Madge was a descendant of several generations of San Jose natives who served their  city and passed that community service ethic  on to her. The city’s first and third fire chiefs,  George and Richard Brown, were ancestors,  and her father, Ralph James, was a San Jose  fire  captain.  Her  late  husband,  Howard  Overhouse, also was a city firefighter. Madge  herself worked for thirty years as a librarian at  San Jose State University and San Jose City  College.  Her career as a librarian spanned almost 40  years and  two  institutions, beginning at San  Jose State, then moved to San Jose Community College. Typical of Madge, she assumed  a leadership role in her profession, serving on  the Santa Clara County Library Commission  from 1976 to 1982, as well as serving on the  California Library Agency  for Systems and  Services  from 1979  to 1984,  representing  Santa Clara County as an alternate for Supervisor Rod Diridon. Madge also served on the  Steering Committee  for  the Master Plan of  California Libraries.  Madge’s multitude of contributions  to  the  community throughout her lifetime is legend,  and the list of civic organizations that Madge  has helped is extensive. We would like to take  a moment to reflect on a few pivotal moments  here.  Madge was one of the first women to serve  on  the Executive Board of  the Santa Clara  County chapter of the Boy Scouts of America.  The Santa Clara County Fair Association benefited from Madge’s input as a Board member  from 1987 to 1995. Madge also served on the  boards of the Iota Delta Chapter of the Chi  Omega sorority and  the Campbell Historical  Preservation Board. Madge was a  long-time  member of the San Jose Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Madge lent her  talents to the Multi-Modal Transportation Task  Force, which led to the completion of Highway  85, which is now a major transportation artery  in the Bay Area. She was honored in 1994 as  a County Woman of Achievement for her volunteerism. At the time, she was the political  director for the county Democratic Information  Center, which she co-founded  in 1969.  In  1986, she was named County Democrat of the  Year. She was a Democratic nominee for the  22nd Assembly District  in 1974, served as  chairwoman of  the Northern California women’s division of the Democratic Party and was  selected  to vote as an elector  in  the 1992  Electoral College. Over  the years, she has  been honored by local police, firefighters and  the AFL–CIO Labor Council. This past January 2003, she was presented  the California  Democratic  Party’s  lifetime  achievement  award.  Madge Overhouse, known for years as the  godmother of the Democratic Party in Santa  Clara County, hobnobbed with top local, state  and national Democrats  for more  than 30  years. She was a Democratic National Committee member and attended all but one of the  party’s  conventions,  since  Jimmy Carter’s  presidency.  Madge  began  volunteering  for  political  causes when politics was uncharted territory  for women. As a result, she helped future generations of women see more possibilities available to them in politics. Also known as an Oracle of the Democratic Party, Madge lent her  expertise to the careers of many public officials both male and  female. Speaking  from  personal experience, Madge’s gentleness  in  behavior, in advice and admonition will be my  compass.  It was on Wednesday, September 29, 2004  that Madge Overhouse died of apparent heart  failure after battling breast cancer  for  two  years. She was 80. The original diagnosis of  cancer was she had a month to live.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss  of a friend, a role model and a constant inspiration. Madge Overhouse’s heroic service  to  our community and guidance to individuals inspired many to go beyond their expectations  and, as a result, contribute to the betterment  of our beautiful and diverse community  in  Santa Clara County. Madge was a true hero,  in every word and action.  f  HONORING YULIYA KOSTROMITINA  HON. DARLENE HOOLEY  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  ",2004
1689,219,2004-10-11,Ms. HOOLEY of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Yuliya Kostromitina, a student  from McKay High School in Salem, Oregon.  Yuliya, the daughter of immigrants from Russia, was selected as a delegate  to  the National Council  for Community and Education  Partnerships  2004 Youth  Leadership Conference in Washington, DC. As a result of the  leadership demonstrated by Ms. Kostromitina,  she was chosen as one of just four students  nationwide, and one of forty internationally, to  attend  the 7th  International Partnership Network Conference in London, England.  Yuliya’s achievement is proof that the GEAR  UP program, or Gaining Early Awareness and  Preparedness for Undergraduate Programs, in  which she participates at McKay High, can  help build great students. GEAR UP provides  five-year grants to states and partnerships to  provide services at high-poverty middle and  high schools. GEAR UP programs serve an  entire group of students beginning in middle  school and continuing  through high school.  Within each school GEAR UP funds are used  to provide meaningful academic enrichment  activities  that  result  in systemic school  improvement and increased student achievement  that will prepare students  to go  to college.  GEAR UP funds are also used to provide college  scholarships  to  low-income  students.  With  its emphasis on school  improvement,  GEAR UP dovetails well with the high standards set by No Child Left Behind and gives  schools the resources needed to meet NCLB  standards. This outstanding program helps at-  risk students succeed in school and prepares  them  to attend college, an option many of  them had previously considered out of reach.  GEAR UP helps students  from  low-income  backgrounds realize that they too can succeed  in college and shows them the path to a better  future.  As Congress considers  reauthorization of  the Higher Education Act,  I hope my colleagues will recognize the value of the GEAR  UP  program  and  continue  to  provide  resources  that will help students  like Yuliya  reach their potential.  f  HONORING MIM KELBER  HON.

1690,219,2004-10-11,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to Mim Kelber, one of the bright, shining  lights of  the women’s movement. Mim  passed away this summer, leaving a legacy of  extraordinary activism and passion for social  justice. Best known as Bella Abzug’s best  friend, soul mate and speechwriter, Mim was  also a much-admired activist and leader in her  own right.  I had the privilege of speaking at her memorial service on August 17, 2004 where I said,  ‘‘This weekend the world lost one of the great  feminists—Mim Kelber.  A labor journalist, freelance writer and activist, Mim devoted her  life  to  improving  the  world she  lived  in. Together with her great  friend, Bella Abzug, Mim encouraged women  to use  their political power  to ensure  their  rights.  There  is not an American woman alive  today who does not have more rights, command more respect or enjoy more opportunity  as a result of  their work  together. Mim and  Bella broke through barriers, shattered glass  ceilings and woke people up.  Mim was a consummate organizer, a terrific  writer and a true idealist. As co-founder of the  National Women’s  Political  Caucus,  the  Women USA Fund, the Women’s Foreign Policy Council and WEDO, Mim worked to bring  other women together to work to achieve common goals.  As an author, Mim helped draft a roadmap  for women to follow in fighting for our rights.  She wrote part of Bella’s unyielding call  to  arms, including the Contract with the Women  of the USA. Mim used her pen to help people  change the way they looked at the world and  how they lived their lives.  Whenever I wanted to organize women to  pass  the ERA,  to  fund UNFPA or  to bring  women  together  for any cause,  I would call  Mim. She was a source of inspiration for me.  A veteran of many of the old battles, she always had good advice about how to fight new  struggles.  It is incumbent upon all women to keep her  spirit alive and to further the irresistible momentum that Mim helped foster. May we long  remember her contributions.

1691,226,2004-10-11,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, on February 29  of this year, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  the  first democratically elected President of  Haiti, was overthrown in a coup d’etat. This  coup d’etat was led by heavily armed thugs  and killers, many of whom are former members of the Haitian Armed Forces which were  disbanded in 1995 and are notorious for their  history of human rights violations. These thugs  and killers have refused  to disarm and now  control several Haitian towns and cities, where  they  terrorize  the  local population. They are  demanding the reestablishment of the Haitian  Armed Forces, and they even had the gall to  claim that the Haitian Government owes them  more than 10 years of back pay.  The following research paper, entitled ‘‘Haiti:  Smoldering on the Edge of Chaos,’’ is an insightful analysis of the crisis in Haiti brought  about by these thugs and killers. The paper  was written by Jessica Leight, a research fellow at the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a nonpartisan, nonprofit  research organization. I hope my colleagues find  Ms. Leight’s analysis informative.  HAITI: SMOLDERINGONTHEEDGEOFCHAOS  Six months after the abrupt and violence-  laced departure of constitutionally-elected  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and over  three months after the deployment of U.N.  peacekeeping units which were hailed as an  instrument for order and stability for this  long-troubled Caribbean  island, Haiti  remains poised on the edge of chaos. Just as  nature in the form of a tropical storm that  has managed to kill as many as 3,000 Haitians, thousands more have died over the  past decade, victims of right-wing military  and paramilitary forces. Today, ruled by a  bumptious, ineffectual and illegitimate cabal  whose only validity is supplied by U.S. fiat,  Haiti now faces the imminent de facto reconstitution of its brutal Haitian Armed Forces  (FADH), dissolved by Aristide in 1995. Across  the island, bands of former soldiers are seizing police stations and establishing themselves as the de facto local power, at times  displacing the remnants of the national police and placing large swaths of the country  under what is effectively outlaw rebel jurisdiction. Meanwhile these soldiers demand  the restitution of unpaid wages over the past  ten years for such services as torturing and  murdering civilian victims.  These soldiers of ill-fortune have met little, if any, resistance from the rump Washington-imposed  interim  government  of  Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, and at  times they have received open encouragement from Latortue’s  ‘‘cabinet members,’’  most notably Interior Minister (and former  general) Herard Abraham and the island’s  notorious justice minister Bernard Gousse,  both of whom have suggested that former  soldiers—some of the most prominent among  whom  have  already  been  convicted  in  absentia for human rights violations committed during the military government of  1991–1994—could simply be  integrated  into  the police force.  ANARMYREBORN  In the face of these developments, FADH  leaders are gathering strength in a bid to retake political power and restore the repression for which the army could always be  counted to provide throughout most of Haiti’s turbulent twentieth-century history, the  U.N.  stabilization  force  and  the  international community alike have remained almost deafeningly silent. At the present time,  the U.N. presence in Haiti is more myth than  fact, while a handful of renegades with a  military background,  in conjunction with  the tiny opposition business and professional  Group of 184, have the clearest access to the  Latortue regime and its ability to obtrusively impact on the daily lives of the population. Within Haiti,  international  troops  drawn principally  from the  former rogue  armed forces of Brazil, Argentina and Chile,  which were better known for the repression  of their own citizens during previous eras of  military rule than for their nation-building  skills, are seemingly paralyzed by inaction.  These U.N.  forces  have made  only  the  paltriest of efforts to preserve order in the  face  of  paramilitary  power-grabs  by  ex-  FADH and police  figures  like Louis-Jodel  Chamblain and Guy Philippe. They have  proven  better  at  stalking  pro-Aristide  Lavalas party’s political forces than well-  armed renegade former soldiers.  In Washington, a State Department preoccupied by Iraq and North Korea appears to  have all but overlooked the island’s existence; and in New York, a craven lack of political will is in evidence, accompanied by  the kind of Machiavellian plotting by the  U.S. and French U.N. Security Council delegations that was witnessed when that body  refused to provide an  international police  force to defend Arisitide earlier this year.  Nor is U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan  any more sensitive to the plight of the Haitian  populace  than  he was  just  before  Aristide’s downfall, when he provided cover  for the U.S. insistence that the former president deserved to be forced into exile because  he was a failed leader.  There has yet to be any kind of clear acknowledgment  of  the magnitude  of  the  threat that Haiti’s already battered democratic institutions face from the military resurgence on the island, much less the strategy which will be used to disarm these illegal militias as well as clearly establish the  authority of a trained, professional police  force, and bring to justice the same former  soldiers accused of human rights abuses who  are now making outrageous demands  for  compensation. Quite to the contrary, as the  exoneration  of  mass  murderer  Louis  Chamblain by Justice Minister Gousse and  the island’s tainted courts graphically exemplifies, Haiti is still a very sick country.  Thus as the clock continues to tick on a  peacekeeping mission originally authorized  for only six months, it seems increasingly  likely that the United Nations will exit Haiti  much as the United States and Canada precipitously did in 1996: leaving behind a profoundly unstable political situation dominated by heavily armed factions, as thousands of weapons remain in the possession of  right-wing vigilantes as well as some in the  hands of pro-Aristide supporters. The situation is made even more volatile today by the  former military leadership’s aspirations to  restore both the army and the same reign of  terror  it applied during  the decades-long  Duvalier and post-Duvalier military dictatorships, as well as under the brutal 1991–1994  military  junta  led by  the brute General  Roaul Cedras.  THEHAITIANMILITARY: RISINGFROMTHE  ASHES?  Among the most alarming signs of military resurgence within the last sixty days  was the acquittal on August 17, in a show  trial, of  former army captain and paramilitary leader Louis-Jodel Chamblain, previously convicted in absentia for the 1993  murder  of  prominent Aristide  supporter  Antoine  Izmery. This outrageous verdict,  achieved under the aegis of Latortue’s disreputable justice minister, Bernard Gousse,  was reached after a ludicrously brief overnight trial in which the prosecution called  only one witness who proved to be entirely  irrelevant to the case. This earned for the interim government opprobrious remarks on  the editorial pages of the New York Times  and the Washington Post, as well as widespread denunciations from human rights organizations, and even from the State Department, which bears much of the blame for the  current dysfunctional  rule of  the  island.  However, the subsequent rash of self-serving  individual power plays on the part of the ex-  soldiers, and the government’s utter unwillingness to confront or even denounce such  challenges to state authority, has received  virtually no attention outside of Haiti. This  development has to be rightfully considered  part of  the  same dangerous phenomenon  which includes the growing power of former  military figures like Chamblain, as well as  sly ideologues like the grinning Justice Minister Gousse, who was clearly complicit in  orchestrating Chamblain’s acquittal.  For example, only six days after the conclusion of the Chamblain trial, the Haitian  Times reported on August 18 that the interim  government had  appointed Winter  Etienne—a leader of the bloody armed uprising  in Gonaives  that preceded Aristide’s  exile, who is also the coordinator of the National Reconstruction Front, a party headed  by  former army officers,  including  rebel  leader Guy Philippe. The last named became  the director of the National Port Authority  in Gonaives, the very city he earlier had  helped sack. At the Ministry of Interior,  former  ranking military  figure Minister  Herard Abraham continues to add  former  high-ranking military cronies to his staff;  among the recent arrivals is former colonel  Williams Regala, a particularly sinister aide  to former dictator General Henri Namphy  and undoubtedly a main plotter of the massacre of voters during Haiti’s aborted November 29, 1987 election. Regala joins another former colleague, Colonel Henri-Robert Marc-Charles, a member of the Cedras-  led military junta that overthrew democratically-elected President Aristide 1991, who  currently is the target of a (as yet un-enforced) judicial order requiring his imprisonment prior to trial for alleged involvement  in a peasant massacre in Piatre in March  1990.

1694,233,2004-10-11,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge  the  life  and  achievements  of  Bishop Moses Taylor, one of New York City’s  foremost spiritual leaders. I am saddened to  report  to  the members of  this chamber  that  Bishop Taylor passed away on October  l,  2004. He is survived by his loving family, his  many  friends and  the congregations of  the  three ministries he founded in Long Island City  and Astoria, Queens.  Bishop Taylor was a fixture of his community for more than 60 years. Bishop Taylor’s  ministry began in a small house on 12th Street  in Long Island City, where he preached to a  group of  twelve  followers;  in  the next  few  years, this ministry moved to a larger, permanent home across  the street and became  known as the Long Island City Gospel Tabernacle. It was during this time that Bishop Taylor began many of the community service initiatives for which his ministries would become  widely known  in  the Queens community.  Indeed,  the  two  founding  principles  of  the  Bishop’s ministries are ‘‘to teach and preach  the Word of God with simplicity and understanding’’ and  ‘‘to undergird, strengthen and  increase (the) community  through programs,  targeted activities  for men, women, singles  and families, combined with educational instruments  that will address  the whole need of  man.’’  Building on the success of the Gospel Tabernacle, Bishop Taylor went on to found the  Astoria Outreach Ministries and the Center for  Hope International in Long Island City, which  is now led by his son, Pastor Mitchell G. Taylor. I am certain that Bishop Taylor was extremely proud to see his son follow in his footsteps and dedicate his  life  to enriching  the  lives of people in the Queens community.  The three ministries founded by Bishop Taylor have become invaluable parts of New York  City’s spiritual life. They are true reflections of  the vibrant and generous Queens community  that Moses Taylor so faithfully served.  Mr. Speaker, I request that my colleagues  join me  in honoring  the  late Bishop Moses  Taylor, whose dedication to community service  lives on thanks to the generosity of his many  followers. With his passing,  the community  has lost one of its true heroes.  9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 8, 2004  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 10) to provide for  reform of the intelligence community, terrorism prevention and prosecution, border  security, and international cooperation and  coordination, and for other purposes:  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to address the Amendment offered  by Mr. KIRKof Illinois which would require that  the President submit a report to the congressional  intelligence committees detailing how  the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA)  can be integrated into the intelligence community. I believe it is important that we recognize  the vital role the DEA has played in our War  on Terror and we should study how effective  it would be to officially include the DEA in our  intelligence apparatus.  Many of  the  terrorist groups  including Al  Qaeda  that are  targeting our Nation derive  much of their income from the sale of drugs  which finances their terror network. It is clear  that narcoterrorism is becoming a larger threat  to our security and the DEA is playing a significant role in reducing this threat. Just last  December the USS Decatur intercepted a boat  in the Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz that was  found to be carrying almost two tons of hashish valued at up to $10 million. The boat was  found  to have direct connection  to  the Al  Qaeda  terror network. While  this  large shipment was intercepted we can safely assume  there are many others that are out there that  pose a threat to our national security.  In Afghanistan, we  replaced  the  brutal  Taliban regime that was harboring Al Qaeda  terrorists, but  today Afghanistan  faces many  threats  from  those same  terrorist networks.  President Karzai himself has said that the cultivation of drugs namely the poppy crop is one  of the biggest threats that Afghanistan faces.  The U.S. State Department has indicated that  poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is expected to  jump by 40 percent this year. In fact, Afghanistan is one of 22 nations listed by President  Bush  in his annual  report  to Congress on  ‘‘major’’ drug-producers. Our own Pentagon is  reporting that the drugs trade is corrupting Afghan government institutions and that without  vigorous eradication, security will not improve  quickly. The U.N. released figures earlier this  year  saying  three-quarters  of  the world’s  opium poppy was now grown in Afghanistan.  These figures are staggering and indicate the  battle we face to eliminate these drugs so that  they can not benefit our terrorist adversaries.  The DEA has played a critical role in challenging Al Qaeda and other  terror networks  that engage in narcoterrorism. The DEA currently has an  international presence with 77  offices  in 55 countries  that gather drug enforcement intelligence, take part in host-country drug-related  law enforcement operations,  and  train host-country  law enforcement personnel. An indication of DEA’s effectiveness in  foreign operations can be found in the intelligence  information  the DEA gathered  to reveal that Osama bin Laden himself had been  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:50 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09OC8.443 E11PT1 ",2004
1695,240,2004-10-11,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to Mim Kelber once again. When Mim  passed away this summer, we lost a woman  whose clear vision and verbal acumen helped  change the world. A brilliant writer, Mim used  her facility with words to inspire supporters of  the  feminist,  labor and environmental movements, among others.  Mim became friends with Bella Abzug when  they were still  in high school, and  they attended Hunter College  together. At Hunter,  Mim became editor of  the Hunter Bulletin  while Bella was elected president of the student body. From 1943 to 1955, Mim was national news editor and Washington Bureau  Chief of Federated Press, a national syndicated labor news service. She covered the  founding meeting of the United Nations in San  Francisco, and the labor movement, as well as  Congress and the White House. She was an  editor/writer  for Science and Medicine  from  1958 to 1970, leaving that position after Bella  was elected to Congress (1971–78).  Mim served as Bella’s executive assistant  and chief speechwriter, co-edited Bella’s Congressional newsletter and was her policy adviser on women, foreign policy, urban affairs  and civil  liberties. Family  life was always of  paramount  importance  to Mim, and she  insisted on working out of Bella’s New York office, so she could  remain  in her Brooklyn  apartment with her husband, Harry Kelber, a  labor  journalist and educator, and  their  two  daughters.  In 1974, Mim chaired the Media Committee  of the National Women’s Political Caucus and  directed a national media campaign, Win With  Women, a major effort to elect more women to  Congress. She was a policy consultant/writer  for President Carter’s National Advisory Committee for Women (1978–79) and co-authored  the official report of the committee’s Houston  conference. She  also  co-authored Gender  Gap: Bella Abzug’s Guide to Political Power  for American Women  (1984); Women and  Government: New Ways  to Political Power  (1994), and Women’s Foreign Policy Directory  (1988). In 1990 she co-founded Women’s Environment and Development Organization with  Bella, and remained involved with WEDO until  her death. Mim leaves her beloved husband,  Harry,  two daughters, Karli and Laura, and  five grandchildren.  Many people spoke movingly at a memorial  service held for Mim on August 17, 2004, and  I have already included some of their tributes  in the RECORD. To honor Mim’s memory, I am  pleased  to offer some additional statements  given that day:  Robin Morgan:  ‘‘I  wrote  down  a  few  thoughts, because  I could almost hear Mim  saying,  ‘‘Don’t wing  it,’’ and adding,  ‘‘Quote  me every chance you get.’’  When Harry kindly asked me to say a few  words today, the first thing I thought of was  Mim’s  lifelong  love affair with words. Others  have noted—as history will—the many details  of her early, continued, consistently principled  life, starting with political engagement even as  a young girl and intensifying across the decades:  the social-justice and  labor and civil  rights and peace and  feminist and environmental organizations she founded, cofounded,  and participated in with never-lessening commitment—and always more than slightly ahead  of the curve.  Of course, just as it was difficult to speak of  Bella Abzug without speaking of Mim, so the  reverse is true. They met in the 1930s: young  girls  in high school. As Mim herself wrote:  ‘‘Bella was class president and already a fearless leader, and I was shy and hung out in the  library. She was an active young religious Zionist—I was an atheist marching  in  radical  May Day parades.’’ Later, they were both in  the first class to enter tuition-free Hunter College’s new Park Ave. building where—Mim’s  words  again:  ‘‘Bella majored  in  political  science and was president of  the Student  Council—I was a journalism major, news editor of the Hunter Bulletin—and still shy.’’ Over  their lifetimes, Mimi and Bella loomed as giants in virtually every progressive movement  of the time and—with all due respect to their  beloved husbands (Harry; and  the  late Martin)— they were like a 20th-century version of  a  ‘‘Boston marriage’’:  joined  in political creativity and dedication, their relationship illuminated by laughter, trust, incredibly hard work,  dauntingly long hours, the familiarity and ability  to  finish each others’ sentences, HUGE  fights, and makings-up. In sum, a lasting political and personal dynamic duo, an historic—  and certainly odd—couple.  It’s no exaggeration to say that they were the Elizabeth Cady  Stanton and Susan B. Anthony of our  time.  Personally,  I never  fully  realized,  just how  challenging  it had been  for Mimi  to write  speeches or statements for Bella—for years—  until I tried it for the first time myself. I just  about killed myself, draft after draft, revision  after revision. Finally, Bella approved the text.  ‘‘It’s OK,’’ she shrugged,  ‘‘but  it sure ain’t  Mimi.’’  Nor were speeches all Mim penned, with  and for Bella—but also on her own. Books. Articles. Manifestos. Reports. Position papers.  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:50 Oct 13, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A09OC8.472 E11PT1 ",2004
1696,39,2004-11-17,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and also I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  Connecticut  who  chairs  the  Subcommittee on Health for what an outstanding job he has done, having served  as the chairman of that committee  with the very, very good staff that he  has. I think it is a credit to him what  we are accomplishing.  I think all of my colleagues know  that Florida has one of the  largest  growing populations of veterans. So  many of us in Florida have to be particularly sensitive. We need new facilities down there. That is why I am very  supportive of H.R. 3936, the Veterans  Health Programs Improvement Act. I  especially  appreciate  that  it  incorporates provisions of H.R. 4768, the Facilities Management Act of  2004, of  which I was an original cosponsor. I  thank the chairman for including that  in  H.R.  3936.  This  will  authorize  projects which  the CARES  (Capital  Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services) Commission recommended to the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He based  his recommendations  last May upon  that, and that is included in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, under CARES, the VA  reviewed all of its facilities systematically  to  consider  where  resources  might be reallocated for optimal service to veterans. I think the veterans  should realize that this was a systematic study. As more veterans have relocated to the Southeast over the years,  it appears the VA has insufficient clinic room in the Southeast, particularly  in my State of Florida. Accordingly,  the majority of the leases which this  legislation would authorize are facilities to be located in the South. The  aim has been to match the assets with  the veterans, and this bill does just  that. Florida, as we know, has the second  largest veterans population and  the number one oldest.  Obviously, I am pleased to see a lease  for a regional health care facility in  South Marion County, my home county, Summerfield, Florida. The plans  are for this clinic to offer comprehensive  services  to veterans,  including  audiology, which  is very  important;  ophthalmology; dermatology, particularly  in Florida; minor surgery; and  complete imaging services. It is going  to be housed  in a  75,000-square-foot  building and provide more services and  greater resources for the veterans than  the existing VA outpatient clinics that  we have throughout my congressional  district. Even better, while this clinic  is predicted to be opened in the summer of 2007, appropriations willing, the  generous, resourceful people of north  central Florida have indeed offered the  VA the use of free space for an interim  clinic, so that should expedite it. So  our  ever-increasing  veterans  population can  see  immediate  relief  for  their long health-care waits in the winter when they come down will be decreased, and this more comprehensive  specialty clinic which the act authorizes will be built and in the long run  will help everybody. I am very enthusiastically supporting this bill.  I want to thank both the Democrats  and Republicans on the Committee on  Veterans’ Affairs and particularly the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS) and the gentleman  from New  Jersey (Mr. SMITH) for their support.  ",2004
1697,39,2004-11-17,Mr. RODRIGUEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield  41⁄2minutes  to  the gentleman  from California (Mr. FILNER), a member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and an activist in pushing forward  on issues regarding veterans.  ",2004
1698,39,2004-11-17,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker, as a member of the VA Subcommittee on Health,  I also rise in support of H.R. 3936 which  includes, as we have heard, a lot of provisions to enhance services to our Nation’s veterans. We have thanked the  gentleman  from  New  Jersey  (Mr.  SMITH),  the gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. EVANS) and the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS).  I would  particularly  like  to  just  thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  RODRIGUEZ), the ranking member, for  his service. I always say, when I get to  the committee meetings, ‘‘Ciro, you’re  my hero.’’ The gentleman from Texas,  for the 8 years he has been here, has  fought steadfastly for his veterans not  only in San Antonio but in the United  States as a whole. He has done a tremendous amount for health care for  our veterans in this Nation, and we  thank him for his service. We are going  to miss him.  One of the important provisions of  this bill is to set up a pilot program to  study new and innovative ways to improve the recruitment and retention of  nurses at the VA. We all know about  the shortage of nurses in our Nation,  and we cannot rely on the old methods  of recruitment. The use of online technology, for example, can be a valuable  tool in finding nurses who are interested in serving the country through  their work at a VA medical facility.  Likewise, we have to find ways to  keep the nurses that we recruit. A second bill that is before us after this has  a provision in fact for alternative work  schedules for nurses. Allowing nurses  to work these flexible hours to accommodate personal and family needs is a  sure way to improve their lives and to  encourage them to continue working at  the VA center. In addition, this bill  provides payments to States to assist  State veterans homes in their hiring  and retention of nurses.  I think we all know that funding for  grants is vital for homeless veterans.  That program will be authorized in this  bill at a level of $99 million, an increase of $24 million. Although we all  know that even more funding is needed  to assist the homeless veterans of our  Nation, this authorization is a welcome  increase. Homelessness among veterans  is a national disgrace. I know we are  all firmly behind the gentleman from  New  Jersey’s  goal  of  eliminating  chronic homelessness within the veterans population in 10 years. This bill  will help us reach that goal.  The bill also gives permanent authority to the VA Secretary to continue  the military sexual trauma counseling  program that was established in 1992.  As we have heard, this program provides counseling and treatment for the  men and women who have experienced  sexual trauma or harassment while in  the military service. Again, the gentleman from Texas was a major supporter of this program, and we thank  him for his leadership once again.  Funding to open several new outpatient clinics is included in this bill,  including two in San Diego County, a  portion of which I represent. The VA’s  move to open clinics near veterans’  homes has been overwhelmingly successful.  I will also continue work for a full  outpatient health clinic  in  Imperial  VerDate Aug 04 2004  03:01 Nov 18, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17NO7.034 H17PT1 ",2004

1700,46,2004-11-17,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of S. 2484, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel  Enhancement Act of 2004.  There are now over 14,000 physicians  and dentists who work  in  the VA  health care system. Unfortunately, the  pay system that the VA uses to pay our  doctors has not been updated  since  1991, and it is not helping the VA’s efforts to recruit and retain high-quality  providers for our veterans.  The current system is very complex  and does not offer the flexibility needed to respond to the changes of competitive markets,  especially  for  the  highest paid subspecialties.  This legislation offers the VA the opportunity to award its physicians and  dentists  for  tenure within  the VA  health care system, and even adds a  performance pay section which acts as  a bonus for those doctors who achieved  specific goals and performance objectives outlined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Thanks to the efforts of the Senate  and House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, we will have legislation that will  greatly enhance the VA’s ability to recruit and  retain high-quality physicians and dentists.  I support this legislation, and I ask  my colleagues to do the same.  ",2004
1701,46,2004-11-17,Mr. SIMMONS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank Chairman SPECTER  and Ranking Member GRAHAM of the  Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs  for their diligence on this important  piece of legislation. Again, I thank our  very distinguished chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH);  our committee ranking member, the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. EVANS);  and my colleague and ranking member  on the Subcommittee on Health Care,  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  RODRIGUEZ), for all of their hard work  on bringing this legislation to fruition.  I would also  like to recognize the  Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs  Staff Director Bill Tuerk  and Bill  Cahill, health counsel to the Senate  committee, without whose hard work  this  compromise  simply would  not  have been possible. Finally, I want to  acknowledge the excellent staff work  conducted by our own committee staff,  Pat Ryan, our committee chief counsel;  staff  director Kingston Smith,  Jeannie McNally, John Bradley, and  Dolores Dunn of the committee staff.  Finally, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the  chairman on Pat Ryan. I had the honor  a number of years ago to serve as staff  director of a committee, regrettably on  the Senate side; but what I  learned  from those 4 years was how difficult it  is sometimes to accommodate the differing views of Members, all of whom  argue in good faith for their points of  view; and observing Pat over the 4  years that I have served on this committee, I think he has done an excellent job. He has been very professional.  He has kept his cool under some difficult circumstances. I wish him all the  best in his future endeavors.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this reform.  ",2004
1702,46,2004-11-17,Mr. RODRIGUEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me take this opportunity also  just to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey (Chairman SMITH) for his leadership and the bipartisan manner in  which we have conducted this piece of  legislation and during the last 8 years.  I want to personally thank the gentleman  from New Jersey  (Chairman  SMITH) for his hard work and for reaching out on behalf of all veterans in this  country. I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from  Connecticut  (Mr. SIMMONS), whom  I  have enjoyed working with, and I want  to personally thank him also for all his  hard work and for coming down to San  Antonio also.  In the same  light, I also want to  thank Pat Ryan. I know that a lot of  times the Members get all the credit  and the staff does all the work. And I  do want to thank the staff from both  sides of the aisle and thank them for  their hard work in a bipartisan manner.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to take this  opportunity  to  thank  our  ranking  member, the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. EVANS). From the very beginning  when I first got elected, he came forth  to my district in San Antonio and was  there with my veterans, one of the first  times; and he has helped to educate me  on a lot of the issues in my district. So  I want to personally thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. EVANS) for  the opportunity of working with him,  and thank him, as well as all the other  veterans here for their service to our  country.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise today as a strong supporter of S. 2484  the Department of Veterans Affairs Health  Care Personnel Enhancement Act of 2004  which  received unanimous approval  in  the  Senate and is now before this body for passage. The Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel Enhancement Act would set forth important new pay provisions for physicians and  dentists employed by the Veterans Health Administration.  These physicians and dentists represent the  lifeblood of the services provided by the Veterans Health Administration. There are over  26,550,000 veterans in the United States, the  great majority of whom rely upon these services to maintain a healthy standard of living. In  the 18th Congressional District alone there are  more than 38,000 veterans and they make up  almost ten percent of the district’s civilian population over  the age of 18. These veterans  rely upon the great services offered at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston. Of course any great medical  facility  is  only as good as  its health care personnel,  which is why this legislation is so necessary to  correct any pay inequities.  The Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel  Enhancement  Act  includes  three  different  components. The first calls for base pay that  is uniform nationwide; which will ensure that  entry level personnel will not be taken advantage and paid lower wages than their counterparts in other facilities. The second component  institutes market pay that varies based on geographic area, specialty, assignment, personal  qualifications, and individual experience. This  component will allow for varying pay grades  based on each individuals experience and circumstance as opposed to fixed pay rates that  do not properly reflect each individual’s contribution to the Veterans Health Administration.  The final component calls for performance pay  linked to the achievement of specific corporate  goals and  individual performance objectives.  Again,  this component will allow  individual  health care personnel to be rewarded based  on their level of service and it will encourage  others  to raise  their  level of performance  in  order to collect performance bonuses. These  three components as a whole will provide a  more equitable and just pay scale physicians  and dentists employed by the Veterans Health  Administration. As a Member  in  this body  I  have always  insisted on our brave veterans  receiving the best of care in the finest health  care facilities that we can provide. The Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel Enhancement Act will allow those who provide these  VerDate Aug 04 2004  03:01 Nov 18, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K17NO7.038 H17PT1 ",2004
1703,74,2004-11-17,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. PASTOR).  (Mr. PASTOR asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1704,74,2004-11-17,Mr. PASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support  of  this  critical  legislation,  which is co-sponsored by the entire Arizona delegation.  Since before the founding of Arizona  as a State, we have, like most other  Western States, struggled to meet the  water demands of our inhabitants. It  has not been easy. In 1968, in hopes of  resolving these problems, the Central  Arizona Project was authorized by the  Federal Government and charged with  distributing water from the Colorado  River to communities and tribes in the  central and southern parts of Arizona.  However, for decades there have been  disputes on the appropriate distribution of these waters, resulting in litigation.  I believe this legislation will resolve  most of these disputes. The entire Arizona delegation, both my Democratic  and Republican colleagues as well as  our two senators and our governor, all  believe this is the best possible solution to this water issue. The people,  municipalities, Native American tribes  and nations and agricultural and environmental  organizations within  the  State also agree.  This legislation represents a significant step  forward  in Arizona’s continuing effort to resolve Native American water rights claims for the benefit  of all of the people of Arizona. This bill  will  resolve  the claims of  the Gila  River Indian community and the remaining claims of the Tohono o’Odham  Nation, while laying the groundwork  for  resolving  the other outstanding  water right claims of Arizona’s Native  American communities and nations.  The bill approves and ratifies the  Gila River Indian Community Water  Rights Settlement Act, amends  the  Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act of 1982, and affirms the right  of  the San Carlos Apache Tribe  to  make future claims for water rights.  The Senate has  approved  this  bill  unanimously and has passed the House  Committee  on Resources, which  I  would like to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. RAHALL), for bringing this bill to  the floor.  It is critical to our State that we approve it here today and move it forward to the President for enactment. I  urge my colleagues to follow the lead  of all eight Arizona representatives and  support its passage.  ",2004
1705,74,2004-11-17,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 437, the Arizona Water Settlements  Act.  I am a cosponsor of H.R. 885, the House  version of this landmark bill that resolves critical water issues facing Arizona and Arizona  tribes today.  Congress authorized  project 35 years ago.  Today, S. 347 offers  resolution  for water  use in Arizona, providing additional water supplies  to resolve  tribal claims and accommodate rapid population growth.  Among other improvements, this bill designs  a solid system and  infrastructure  to provide  Arizona tribes with affordable water.  After many years, tribes in this region, such  as the Gila River Indian Community, will be  able to retain and maintain their water rights  without continuous years of court battles.  Everyone has the right to clean, abundant  and affordable water—and our first Americans  are no exception.  The Arizona Water Settlements Act will be  considered the largest Indian water settlement  in U.S. history, and  this was obviously no  small task.  The bill is strongly supported by appropriate  state agencies, the entire Arizona delegation,  the  Gila  River  Community,  the  Tohono  O’odham tribe, and a number of diverse Arizona interests.  the Central Arizona  I commend the Arizona delegation and the  Democratic and Republican staff for working  through their differences for a polished bill.  I look forward to seeing this bill become law,  and the positive changes it will make for Arizona’s water supply in the future.  ",2004

1718,88,2004-11-17,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R.  1446,  the California  Missions Preservation Act. I would like  to  thank  the gentleman  from California (Mr. FARR) for introducing this  bill, and I am proud to be an original  cosponsor.  The California missions provide an  important part of California’s past, and  their history can be traced to 1493. The  Sixth District of California,  located  across the Golden Gate Bridge  from  San Francisco, is the district I am so  pleased to represent. We are fortunate  to have one of these missions, the San  Raphael Mission  and  another,  the  Sonoma Mission, is just outside of my  district.  The San Raphael Mission was originally built in 1817 as an outpost chapel  of the San Francisco Mission. Named  for Saint Raphael, the angel of bodily  healing, it was thought that the sunny  hillside on the north side of the bay  would be a good place for the sick to  convalesce. In only 5 years, it became a  healthy settlement, and on October 19,  1822, it became an independent mission.  After it was secularized, the mission  fell into ruin, and 32 years later the  original mission was torn down. But in  1947 a new mission was built near the  original site, based on a painting of the  old mission.  The San Francisco Solano Mission,  founded in 1823 in Sonoma County, was  the last and most northerly of the 21  Franciscan missions of Alta California.  Sonoma Mission,  as  it  is  properly  called, was the dedicated goal of the  young  and  zealous  Padre  Jose  Altimira. He headed into the northern  wilderness to find a more healthy location for a mission than the crowded  San Francisco area. In Sonoma Valley  he found his ideal location, with fertile  soil and mild, sunny climate.  Secularization of the mission in 1834  was followed by neglect and decay. In  1881, the church and padres’ quarters  were sold and used as a hay barn, winery and blacksmith shop. However, the  mission was rescued from disintegration in 1903 when it was bought by the  Historic Landmarks League and turned  over  to  the State. Full  restoration  began in 1911.  There is still so much more to do to  restore these historic treasures. Mr.  Speaker, it is important that we save  these missions so they can pass on  their history to future generations. I  urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.  ",2004
1719,88,2004-11-17,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  support of  the Senate Amendments  to  the  California Missions Preservation Act. I am a  co-sponsor of this bill, and I am pleased that  we are sending it to the White House before  we adjourn.  Because of this legislation, important historical sites in California will be better preserved  for future generations of Americans to enjoy  and learn about our state’s rich heritage.  I am proud to represent in my district the  Mission San Gabriel Arca´ngel. This  is  the  fourth of  twenty-one missions established  in  California during the Spanish colonial era.  Orginally  founded  in 1771  in present-day  Montebello, it was moved in 1776 to what is  now San Gabriel. Built by the Franciscans and  Native American Gabrielenos, the Mission San  Gabriel Arca´ngel would become what famed  Spanish missionary Junipero Serra would call  ‘‘The Pride of the Missions.’’  The government eventually changed  from  Spanish  to Mexican,  then  from Mexican  to  American. In the early 20th Century, control of  the Mission would  eventually  go  to  the  Claretian Missionaries with the Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose providing education  at the parish school. Yet the Mission would always be an integral part of the community, a  jewel of the southland, a wondrous remnant  from  the  first of many who built  the greater  Los Angeles area into a world-class destination.  Today, the Mission is set amount a large,  diverse and gracious community. Local residents still seek spiritual guidance there, and  cactus  garden. The Mission  thrives  as  a  source of pride among residents of the San  Gabriel Valley, and I pleased that Congress is  recognizing the importance of protecting this  and other Missions.  ",2004
1720,88,2004-11-17,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in  strong support of H.R. 1446, the California Missions Protection Act. I thank  my  colleague  from  California, Mr.  FARR, for his continued role in preserving the Golden State’s wonderful  treasures.  I  also  thank  our  distinguished California colleagues  in  the  other chamber for their leadership and  support  in pushing this bill through  the Senate.  The missions  inspired  by Father  Junipero Serra are a favorite destination for millions of people around the  world. These historical monuments are  a symbol of Catholicism, and the early  efforts to unify Native Americans with  the Spanish settlers. We admire the  missions as a sanctuary, a place of worship, and a symbol of American History.  In 1769, Father Serra erected Mission  San Diego Alcala. This would be the  first of 21 historic missions built along  the beautiful Pacific coastline. The  missions have been a significance part  of California’s culture for over two centuries. Even Pope John Paul II, recognizing the significance of Father Serra,  blessed these missions in his visit to  the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo  Mission in 1987.  The citizens of Orange County treasure our  local mission, Mission San  Juan Capistrano. Created  in 1776,  it  continues to be used as a place of peace  and worship. We consider ourselves fortunate to experienced the Serra Chapel, the only building left in which Father Serra gave mass. We watch in delight every year as the world famous  swallows return to their summer home.  Unfortunately, after two centuries of  wear and tear, as well as numerous  earthquakes, much of the infrastructure of these buildings is deteriorating.  It  is  our  interest,for  the  sake  of  preservinga piece of American History,  that we put forth the effort to restore  these elegant buildings and artifacts.  Again, I thank the Honorable SAM  FARR for his efforts to restore California’s treasures. I am proud to support  his efforts, and the efforts of so many  others to protect and preserve the Missions of California.

1721,102,2004-11-17,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  from California  (Mr.  BERMAN), ranking member of this very  important Subcommittee on Courts,  the  Internet, and  Intellectual Property, for yielding me this time.  His explanation has been more than  sufficient in which we make sure that  what we are doing with the Copyright  Arbitration Royalty Panel is done correctly. And with H.R. 1417, with which  I was pleased to join him and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENand  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  SMITH),  subcommittee  chairman, on, with the gentleman from  California (Mr. BERMAN), does it.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. Those of us in Congress and the private  sector who  follow how  the government sets  copyright royalty rates agree that the current  system needs change.  It  is expensive, unwieldy, and too unpredictable. Based on that,  subcommittee Chairman SMITH, subcommittee  Ranking Member BERMAN, and  I  introduced  legislation, H.R. 1417, that would make substantial procedural changes.  We heard the current system is costly because the copyright owners and users have to  pay for the arbitrators. Because copyright law  subjects copyright owners and users to a compulsory process, we believe the law should not  place this additional financial burden on them.  Our bill creates 3 Copyright Royalty Judges  who would be paid from appropriated funds to  set royalty rates and distribute royalty fees.  SENBRENNER)  Another complaint was that the CARP does  not have adequate rules on how to address  hearsay evidence. This bill explicitly requires  that the judges treat hearsay evidence in the  same manner  that  it  is  treated  in Federal  court. This will bring uniformity  to  the proceedings for parties on both sides of royalty  disputes.  This bill also alters the terms for which certain royalty rates are in effect. Rates that are  determined by the Judges will be in effect for  5 years. This should create some predictability  and uniformity  for  those who  rely on  the  Judges’ determinations.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this  bill as amended.  ",2004

1733,116,2004-11-17,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  5363 to provide a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges in fiscal year  2005.  By way of background, Congress enacted  the Executive Salary Cost-of-  Living Adjustment Act in 1975, which  was intended to give judges, Members  of Congress and high-ranking executive  branch officials automatic COLAs accorded other Federal employees unless  rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress  amended the statute by enacting section 140 of Public Law 97–92, which requires specific congressional action to  grant judges a COLA.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us  is based on the template set forth in  H.R. 3349, now Public Law 108–167. That  law satisfied the section 140 requirement and thereby enabled judges to receive a COLA this past fiscal year. H.R.  5363 accomplishes the same purpose for  fiscal year 2005.  H.R. 5363 will ensure that Federal  judges receive a COLA when other civil  servants,  including Members of Congress, receive theirs. The  legislation  will assist in the administration of justice in our Federal courts and is otherwise noncontroversial. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2004
1734,116,2004-11-17,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  This is a great day in the Federal  system where we on the Committee on  the Judiciary have decided to authorize  a COLA for the members of the Federal  judicial system in America. Now, there  are only a couple of problems here, and  I, of course, enthusiastically support  H.R. 5363.  The first is that those who work in  the administrative office of the courts,  those who work for the Federal judges,  now enjoy greater salaries than the  judges themselves.  The second thing is that, under the  system that we are implementing, Article III, section 1 of the Constitution,  the fact of the matter is that the failure to provide past cost-of-living adjustments to our Federal judiciary has,  in the last decade, resulted in an economic reduction in salary in the equivalent amount of $77,000, and so we are  now faced with a crisis of dozens, six  dozen, judges having left the judiciary  in the past several years.  I think it is obvious to all that it is  hard to continue to maintain a qualified and independent judiciary if we are  not paying them a just wage.  Having said this, we have brought  this measure forward, not a moment  too soon, to provide for them a cost-of-  living adjustment for the present term.  So I enthusiastically join the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) in supporting this measure.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 5363, a bill authorizing  cost-of-living salary adjustments  for  justices  and judges of the federal courts for fiscal year  2005 that has been introduced by Chairman  and  co-sponsored  by  Ranking Member JOHNCONYERSof the Judiciary Committee. The bill would provide  for a  2.5 percent adjustment of federal judiciary salaries. I thank the Chairman for his leadership  in bringing  this very  important matter  to  the  floor. In 1981, Congress passed a Joint Resolution Making Further Continuing Appropriations for FY 1982, and Section 140 of that legislation read as follows:  Notwithstanding any other provision of law  or of this joint resolution [Pub. L. 97–92], none  of the funds appropriated by this joint resolution or by any other Act shall be obligated or  expended to increase, after the date of enactment of this joint resolution [Dec. 15, 1981],  any salary of any Federal judge or Justice of  the Supreme Court, except as may be specifically authorized by Act of Congress hereafter  enacted: Provided, That nothing in this limitation shall be construed to reduce any salary  which may be in effect at the time of enactment of this joint resolution nor shall this limitation be construed in any manner to reduce  the salary of any Federal judge or of any Justice of the Supreme Court.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4516, the Department of Energy High-  End Computing Revitalization Act of  2004.  I had the pleasure of working on this  legislation with my esteemed colleague  across the aisle, the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. BIGGERT), who does an excellent  job  on  the  Committee  on  Science, and I look forward to having  more opportunities to work with her  on other important policy goals that  we are able to  impact at the Committee on Science.  The bill authorizes research and development activities at  the Department of Energy to provide for the design, the development and the deployment of powerful computing systems,  including both hardware and software.  It will lead to the development of the  computational tools needed for solving  the most demanding science and engineering problems. The activities authorized will constitute part of the ongoing  interagency  information  technology research and development program established by the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991.  H.R.  4516 will build on  the demonstrated expertise of the Department  of Energy in advancing the technology  needed for designing and building the  most  powerful  scientific  computing  systems in the world.  Equally important, the bill provides  for the development and deployment of  leadership-class  computing  systems,  such as the system recently announced  for installation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which will provide  access on a competitive basis for the  research  community  in  the United  States.  The effect of the bill will be to put  into the hands of researchers the tools  they need to attack the most challenging problems in science and engineering, as well as to accelerate the development  of  the  computing  tools  needed to underpin industrial competitiveness and our national defense.  Finally, H.R. 4516 will help to implement the Federal plan  for high-end  computing that was released earlier  this year by the Office of Science and  Technology Policy.

The  hearing was a  success. We  received  positive  feedback on this  legislation  from a number of experts on high-performance computing who testified before the committee.  I also would like to acknowledge the  U.S. supercomputing industry for its  impressive  accomplishments.  I  congratulate IBM for its new Blue Gene/L  supercomputer, which was recognized  just last week as the fastest computer  in the world. The Blue Gene/L is faster  than Japan’s Earth Simulator, which  held the world record  in computing  speed for nearly 3 years. With passage  of this bill, the DOE can work closely  with IBM and other industry leaders  like Cray and Silicon Graphics Incorporated as well as academia to ensure  that the United States continues to be  home to the world’s fastest supercomputer for years to come.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation, which extends an  important program until September 30, 2005.  As many of my colleagues know, authorization for the U.S. Department of  Agriculture’s Mandatory Price Reporting Program, which was passed in the  1999 agriculture appropriation, expired  on October 23. This program requires  USDA to operate a mandatory price reporting system for beef, pork and lamb,  which provides useful information for  everyone engaged  in the buying and  selling of these products.  In the absence of authority to enforce mandatory reporting, the USDA  has contacted the companies to encourage them to continue reporting data  during the gap in program authorization. It is my understanding that everyone has been cooperating. This is  because they recognize the important  role this data plays in price discovery  and  in  the operation of marketing  agreements.  There is also a clear agreement that  the  current program  should be  extended for an additional year to provide  livestock producers, the packer  community and other interested parties additional time to  identify and  agree upon these technical  improvements to the law.

Today, just as the Washington Post reported that it would and just as our  nightly news reported that it did, the  majority amended its own leadership  structure, if we can believe it, to allow  a Member under felony criminal indictment to hold a position of leadership in  this body.  The majority party campaigned on  its alleged moral values agenda, but  when they got back to Washington,  moral values flew right out the window. I am sorely disappointed to see  the majority so quickly and so arrogantly turn  its back on  its biggest  promise  to America. The  proposed  leadership rule change is a flagrant and  despicable insult to the American public and is firm evidence that the majority party’s moral compass is permanently off center.  Indeed, this rule was adopted by the  majority in 1993 as an effort to bring  accountability to this House’s leadership  structure, and  rightly  so. Our  elected leaders must be of the highest,  utmost moral fiber, and I dare anyone  to disagree with that notion.  Now, the majority finds it politically  inconvenient  to  hold  congressional  leaders accountable and wants to allow  Members  facing  felony  criminal  charges to continue tarnishing this institution. What sort of moral value  does the majority exhibit by allowing  those under criminal investigation to  infiltrate our highest leadership posts?  Can our children ever truly understand  moral clarity when the majority allows  those  facing criminal  felony  indictments to rule the roost? Has the majority lost so much control of its own  moral balance by rewarding Members  facing  felony  criminal  indictments  with the perquisites of leadership?  Clearly, the majority is struggling,  and unsuccessfully at that, to find its  own moral balance. The majority  is  verbally tap dancing around this issue,  claiming  incredulously  that  State  court criminal indictments carry less  weight than Federal court criminal indictments. Instead of supporting State  prosecutors, the law enforcement officers who  protect  our  communities  against waves of criminal behavior, the  majority has attacked them as partisan hacks with hidden agendas.  What sort of moral values does the  majority display by declaring local law  enforcement efforts irrelevant? Would  any of us tell our children to ignore the  safety warnings given by our brave police officers, firefighters and other law  enforcement figures? For the safety of  our Nation, I pray not.  Mr. Speaker, the law is the law, period. If you are suspected of breaking  it, then you are the subject of a criminal indictment. This is a simple, basic  and fundamental moral lesson anyone  can faithfully recite, yet one the majority apparently does not understand.  The Congress is not the place to play  fast and loose with the principles of  moral clarity nor should any majority  exploit  its  own  internal  rules  and  structure for crass political purposes.  When we make excuses to allow anyone under  felony  indictment to  lead  Congress, we set ourselves down a slippery  slope of  immoral activity and  scheming. These are not the type of  morals  and  values  that  the  voters  thought they were voting for on election day; nor should the majority so  brazenly embrace this  foundation of  corruption.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The majority talked about moral values on the campaign trail but clearly  blanked on their empty promise once  back in Washington. The majority is  not about morals. It is not about values but one thing and one thing only,  VerDate Aug 04 2004  06:48 Nov 18, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17NO7.129 H17PT1 ",2004
1746,137,2004-11-17,Mr. JACKSON of  Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take this opportunity to recognize  and honor my colleague  from  Illinois Congressman WILLIAMLIPINSKIwho is retiring from  Congress after 21 years of service.  Mr. LIPINSKI—the congressman from the 3d  District—grew up on  the southwest side of  Chicago and he has remained there as a lifelong  resident. He began his political career  with the Chicago Parks District, was elected  23rd Ward alderman and ward committeeman  in 1975. First elected to Congress in 1983, Mr.  is currently the longest serving Democrat in the Illinois delegation.  Since the beginning of his career as a congressman, Mr. LIPINSKIhas been a member of  the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure—formerly the House Committee  on Public Works and Transportation. As a  member of this committee, he has served as  Ranking Member  on  the Railroads  Subcommittee, Ranking Member on Aviation, and  is currently Ranking Member on the powerful  Highways, Transit and Pipeline Subcommittee.  I’m glad he’s on this side of the aisle. It’s  easier to go to war with Mr. LIPINSKIon your  side than on the other side.  BILLLIPINSKIhas worked devotedly and passionately on behalf of his constituents. He has  made many important contributions to the City  of Chicago and the state of Illinois. I’m thankful for his service to our city, state and nation.  LIPINSKI And I’m proud to call him my friend.  Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues and  thank Mr. LIPINSKI for his service and wish him  and his family the best in the years to come.  ",2004
1747,137,2004-11-17,Mr. PETRI.," Mr. Speaker, I want to join in  this tribute to the many years of public service  and the more than 20 years of service here in  the House of our colleague BILLLIPINSKI.  I have had the privilege of serving with BILL  on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for many years. During this Congress,  he has served as the ranking Democrat on the  Subcommittee on Highways, Transit and Pipelines. Together, we had  to navigate  through  the often  frustrating, confusing and  twisting  course of the transportation bill reauthorization  effort this year and last. BILLhas always been  a steady partner and a strong defender of the  program. He certainly hasn’t been reluctant to  voice his strong support for increased investment in transportation. He is a great fighter,  and we have been lucky to have him on our  side during this particular fight. I have valued  his advice and counsel these past two years  as  together we have worked  to produce a  transportation program that moves our country  forward.  Beyond our work  together on  the Subcommittee, we have worked together on other  issues, such as the expansion of O’Hare and  many years fighting the whistle ban to protect  our towns that had developed around the railroad tracks crisscrossing through our districts.  Apart  from  the Committee activities, BILL  has been a tireless advocate for his constituents. He was born on the southwest side of  Chicago, and he truly knows and understands  his district. Prior  to coming  to Washington,  BILLwas a Chicago City alderman and he still  is a Ward committeeman—a good education  for any member of this House!  So I want to acknowledge BILL’s courage,  his strength in standing by his convictions, and  his love for the City of Chicago. He has had  a real impact, and his successes can be seen  all over  the city—whether riding  the  ‘‘el’’ or  landing on a plane at Midway.  I wish him and his wife, Rose Marie, all the  best on his retirement. He has been a valuable member of the House, and we will miss  him.  f  CELEBRATING  35-YEAR CONGRESSIONAL CAREER OF THE HONORABLE PHILIP M. CRANE OF ILLINOIS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BEAUPREZ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 7, 2003, the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. MANZULLO) is recognized for 60 minutes as  the designee of the majority leader.  GENERALLEAVE  ",2004
1748,137,2004-11-17,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my special order today.  ",2004
1749,137,2004-11-17,The SPEAKER pro tempore., Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?  There was no objection.  ,2004
1750,137,2004-11-17,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Speaker, it is a  real honor to be able to honor my close  friend PHILCRANE, my neighbor, a person with whom I share one of our counCRANE ties, and others are here to do the same  thing. I will reserve my remarks for  later.  First I would like to recognize the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. PENCE).  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2004
1751,137,2004-11-17,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr. MANZULLO) for leading this special order tonight that I expect will be well attended as we celebrate 35 years of principled, conservative leadership on Capitol Hill.  I have scarcely been in this institution 4 years, Mr. Speaker. The very  thought of arriving at a place 31 years  from now in my career and still enjoying a reputation for integrity to principle, for personal integrity that Congressman PHIL enjoys  is  a  lodestar for me. I rise today to speak  on behalf of the gentleman from Illinois. I spoke today as the new incoming chairman of the Republican Study  Committee, a 96-member caucus of the  House of Representatives, with one of  our new freshmen who, when I spoke to  her about our plans for this evening,  said that one of the great thrills of her  life 10 years ago in Washington State  at  the Republican  convention as a  brand new  freshman member of the  State legislature was a chance to introduce PHILCRANE, the keynote speaker  at the Washington State Republican  convention. She was thrilled at the  thought of being able to spend however  few days in the same Congress and call  PHILCRANEa colleague.  I rise today to make sure that the  CONGRESSIONALRECORDremembers this  principled, conservative man for who  he was in totality. Congressman PHIL  CRANEwas first elected to Congress in  a special election held in November of  1969 to fill a vacancy created by the  resignation of another noteworthy Illinoisan by the name of Donald Rumsfeld who has gone on to other productive ventures for his Nation.  PHILCRANEwas born on November 3,  1930, the second of five children. His father, Dr. George Crane, was the author  of a nationally syndicated newspaper  column entitled ‘‘Worry Clinic’’ which  ran in papers for over 40 years. His  mother, Cora, reared their children on  Chicago’s south side where my own  family grew up. CRANE received his  bachelor’s degree from Hillsdale College in Michigan, and with that pedigree, after college, he served  in the  United States military  from 1954 to  1956. He continued his education in history by earning a master’s and a doctorate degree from Indiana University  in Bloomington, Indiana. The career  and the  life and the  legacy of PHIL  CRANE, or Dr. CRANEas we like to call  him, continues to be a source of enormous pride for Hoosiers.  After graduation, Dr. CRANE served  as a professor at both Indiana University and Bradley University in Peoria,  Illinois. He also served as the director  of schools at Westminster Academy in  VerDate Aug 04 2004  05:28 Nov 18, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17NO7.142 H17PT1 ",2004
1752,144,2004-11-17,Mr. HOEFFEL.," I  hear that many times.  But seriously, the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania (Mr. HOEFFEL) did something that does not happen all the time  around here. He really led, and he led  in an important issue to make sure  Americans heard a voice about Iraq  other than just from the White House,  and that is important we have that debate. This was a creation of his and I  think has been useful, and I know a lot  of people have appreciated it, and I appreciate his  leadership on  that. We  look forward to when the gentleman is  back  in public service. So we hope  within 2 years, maybe even shorter.  Who knows?  But with that, let me turn to the subject here which is a tough one tonight.  I have to call a mother and father who  lost  their  19-year-old  Marine  in  Fallujah this week tomorrow, and it is  very difficult because all three of us  here this evening voted against this  war, and we have all had this experience of talking to families. It is very,  very difficult.  What I am going to say is, what I  know what we all have said, is no matter what you think of the policy, these  are all good Americans who served, and  no American has died  in vain while  serving under the flag of the United  States. I am going to do my best to  make sure parents appreciate that. No  matter what you think of the policy,  they died as heroes, and the people who  are sitting tonight in Fallujah, that is  how I think of them, no matter what  you think of the policy. I know we all  share that view.  It is difficult because it does inspire  some anger sometimes I think in all of  us as to what has happened in Iraq,  where a war was started based on false  assumptions about weapons of mass destruction and  false assumptions and  statements by the White House about  Saddam’s connection to 9/11.  The trouble I have tonight is that the  same type of source of the mistake was  made unfortunately  is being perpetuated by the White House. In other  words, one would think after the White  House  started a war based on  two  major  falsehoods, that was given to  him by certain people, that the President would be doubly diligent to endeavor to get people who would not  perpetuate that same kind of mistake,  but in fact, what we have seen since  the election on November 2 is sort of  like a green light for hubris, a green  light to go ahead and actually make  stronger in the administration the very  voices that fouled up in giving us bad  information about this war and making  repeated misjudgments about how to  perpetuate it.  Just look at the decisions that have  been made in the last week. The man  who himself admitted  responsibility  for putting a false statement into the  State of the Union address, where the  President told people that Saddam was  trying to get uranium to build a nuclear weapon, it was a clear falsehood  in the State of the Union address, and  the man who himself admitted being  responsible for telling Americans and  the world that falsehood did not get  docked pay, did not get fired. He just  got a promotion to the National Security Council. So here we have the guy  who is responsible for a major failure  of American information that led to a  war where 1,200 Americans have died.  He gets a promotion. This is a perpetuation of this arrogant attitude that  has got us into this pickle in Iraq.  What happens to the Defense Secretary who has had running arguments,  as we know, with the Secretary of  State Colin Powell about whether to go  into this war and how to perpetuate it?  Who is the one who leaves? It is the  guy who, we are told at least, said let  us be scrupulous about this, and the  Secretary of Defense stays, the one  who has been in charge of this since  Abu Ghraib and did not give us accurate  information,  including the U.S.  Congress, leading up to this.  Then what do we see happens at the  CIA? Well, here’s the capper for me.  Here we have a man who  left this  chamber. He is now heading the CIA.  What is the first thing he does, almost  first thing he does? He writes a memo  to all the CIA employees. I have not  seen this memo but it is quoted in the  paper. It says, he expects all employees  that their job is to support the administration and its policies in our work  and as agency employees we do not  identify with, identify with, support or  champion opposition to the administration or its policies.  b2130  He sent a very strong message to CIA  employees: what  the White House  wants, it is going to get. And that is  language that people understand.  The last thing this President needs is  unanimity from his intelligence agencies. He needs debate. He needs to be  told some information that may not  square with his preordained view of the  world. And, in fact, they are going the  wrong way at the CIA and firing people  who have deigned to give the President  information that is different from information he believes to be true.  ",2004
1753,144,2004-11-17,Mr. STRICKLAND.," Mr. Speaker, if  the gentleman from Washington will  yield just on that point, the last thing  this country needs  is  for our  intelligence, our CIA to be politicized, to  have  decisions  made,  conclusions  reached that are based on political considerations rather than on factual, objective data.  This memo from a newly appointed  CIA director, Mr. Goss, is a blatant attempt to politicize our intelligence operations, to politicize the CIA. What  that will do is place this country at  great risk. Because if we cannot trust  the intelligence to be based on actual  fact, actual objective data as best we  can  collect  it,  but make  decisions  based on political considerations, then  that will put the American people at  risk, and it will put our troops at risk.  That is absolutely almost unthinkable, that a newly appointed director of  the CIA would be so insensitive and out  of touch that he would actually put  such a directive into a written memo  and have it circulated.  And I yield back to the gentleman.  ",2004
1754,144,2004-11-17,Mr. INSLEE.," I thank the gentleman  for his comments, Mr. Speaker, and let  me continue.  Later on in the memo, Goss has language that says ‘‘We provide the intelligence as we see it and let the facts  alone speak to the policymaker.’’ But  when you send a memo to your employees suggesting they dare not ever say  anything to challenge the President’s  preassumptions, that sentence does not  bear out this memo. The message was  sent and I am sure received by the CIA.  And I am very disturbed about something I saw last night, a show I was  watching, and I cannot remember the  name of it, but a former CIA person  who has now left the agency and who  was the person in charge of the unit  searching for Osama bin Laden was on  this program. This was the gentleman  whose professional duty  it was,  for  about 6 years, to  lead the hunt  for  Osama bin Laden. In fact, he was so aggressive about  it,  for about 2 years  they took him off the job because he  was driving his superiors nuts because  he was raising these red flags about  Osama bin Laden. After September 11,  they put him back on the post because  they realized he was right about how  serious this issue was.  He has now left the post, but last  night he said there was absolutely no  credible evidence of a substantive link  between Osama bin Laden and Saddam  Hussein. The number one guy in the  employment of the Central Intelligence  Agency last night told Americans there  was no link. And for a year or more,  the President, the Vice President, you  name it, was running around America  trying  to create  this  impression  in  America’s mind that there was a link  in order to justify this war. That is disturbing to me.  Here is a guy that ought to be in the  CIA challenging the White House’s political decisions. He needs to be on the  job rather than spit out of the agency  like a watermelon seed. That is what  they are doing. Anyone down there who  is challenging the White House orthodoxy is getting kicked out.  This is not a good thing for our future decisions. We have tough decisions  to make with regard to Iraq. This offensive in Fallujah, where heroes died,  and they were heroic, but it is not the  end of the trail. We have some tough,  tough decisions.  I yield back to my colleague from  Pennsylvania (Mr. HOEFFEL).  ",2004
1755,144,2004-11-17,Mr. HOEFFEL.," Well, Mr. Speaker, I  thank my colleagues, and I am very  concerned about the problems we are  seeing at the CIA.

1756,228,2004-11-17,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I yield  10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.  ",2004
1757,228,2004-11-17,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator from Montana for the opportunity to use a few  minutes to describe what I see as the  latest in a series that is rather discouraging for America. It is fair to say,  using that expression that has been  coined around the country over a number of years: Mr. President, there we go  again. For the third time in 3 years,  President Bush has gone over the limit  on our Nation’s credit card. So now the  President is asking Congress to raise  his limit. That is often an expression  used at gaming tables in Las Vegas and  Atlantic City and other casino establishments. I don’t know whether that is  what we have here. Is this a casino  where we are willing  to bet  table  stakes, everything that we have, because we are out of control?  I want to say to President Bush that  this solution may work for you, but everyday Americans don’t have the luxury of simply saying: You know what,  give me a little more credit so I can  continue to deal with this so irresponsibly. Banks simply will not agree to  increase people’s credit  limits when  they rack up dollars and debt on their  card. That is what President Bush is  asking members to do today. We are  the bank’s chief lending officers and he  wants us to raise his credit limit.  Simply put, what we are seeing in  this administration is credit card economics. It is totally irresponsible and  among the most reckless administrations  in the history of this country  with their fiscal management.  Why are we in this mess? Because  President Bush and the Republican majority  in the Congress decided they  wanted to give the wealthiest in America a big tax cut. A portion of the  President’s tax cut goes to people like  myself who are in the highest percentage of wage earners.  I had a successful business career. I  was lucky I did what I did in the computer industry many years ago when  America presented all kinds of opportunities  for me to work and create  something of lasting value.  The top 1 percent of the wage earners  are receiving this tax cut that equals  $100 billion every single year. That is  almost a third of the total cost of operating. The worst part about this mountain of debt we are being asked to authorize is it is going to be on the backs  of our children and grandchildren. Who  among us would say, I want to live  high on the hog, so here, kids, here  grandchildren, you pay the bill while  we go ahead on this spending kick?  President Bush simply wants to leave  this debt burden to future generations.  I don’t want to do it.  If colleagues vote to raise this debt  limit, they are voting to saddle every  child in this country with an immediate debt burden of $27,764.  I look at the wonderful young people  we have, known as pages, who get a  taste of government from their experience here, spending a term  in their  high school years. Each page will owe  $27,000 as a result of what we are doing  here today. It raises the debt  limit  above $8 trillion for the first time ever  in our history.  It is sometimes hard to get a grasp  on numbers like that, so let me try to  put that in perspective. I cannot imagine what $8 trillion is like. We are not  talking about stacks of $1 bills. It is  two-thirds of the value of the entire  New York Stock Exchange. That  is  how much we are in debt. If we want to  pay it off right now, we have to hand  over two-thirds of our stock market. It  is  irresponsible.  It  is  impossible  to  comprehend.  The deficit is a real problem that affects our lives and our Nation’s economy. When President Bush took over  and got a resounding endorsement from  people across the country for his second term, we were in a position of surplus. I was on the Budget Committee. I  was fairly senior on the Budget Committee on  the Democratic  side. We  struggled and we pushed and President  Clinton encouraged us and he twisted  arms of both parties—not  just  the  Democrats, but the Republicans—and  we got a balanced budget in place. We  had over $200 billion in surplus in the  year 2002.  Now we are looking at a debt just for  this year that could be somewhere in  the $600 billion range; $488 billion. But  including the cost for the extra borrowing, it will be somewhere around  $600 billion  in debt. When President  Bush took over we had an almost $300  billion surplus. That is quite a change.  Tomorrow, there is an official dedication ceremony for the Clinton Presidential Center. What a difference between the economic policies of those  days and current times. President Clinton understood the importance of fiscal  discipline. Right now, there is no concept of it whatever. What we have now  is a deficit attention disorder. We look  at this credit card and we see what has  been asked: Through November of 2004,  $7.384 trillion.  I was the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee in 1997 when we  negotiated the historic Balanced Budget Act that produced surpluses for the  first time in three decades. What we  were looking for was a $5 to $7 trillion  surplus in 10 years.  There is no fiscal discipline. We are  running the biggest deficit in history.  Because of the 1997 balanced budget  agreement, the surpluses it produced,  we were able to pay down $600 billion in  debt. We were on a path to pay off public debt by the year 2008. Now, because  of the reckless tax cuts that President  Bush and  the Republican controlled  Congress have pushed through, instead  of being debt free, we are going to be at  least $10 trillion in debt by 2008. No one  on the other side can seriously argue  that we will be better off $10 trillion in  debt.  The Republican plan is to borrow and  spend, saddle future generations with  the responsibility for paying the bills.  That is a terrible abuse of the financial  future of our country. I don’t think responsibility of our children should be  just a Democrat or Republican value.  It should be an American value. We  cannot abandon it.  We all know in our homes and families, if we spend more than we take in,  if we spend more than our salaries, we  have to be able to borrow to keep our  families  afloat. That  is what  the  United States of America is doing right  now, borrowing to keep us afloat, putting us ever deeper in debt, and transferring that obligation from ourselves  to future generations. My children, my  grandchildren, and other people’s children and grandchildren will have to  shoulder part of that.  I yield the floor.  ",2004

I wanted to talk a  little bit about the measure in front of  us, raising the debt limit yet one more  time on the American people.  I liken it really to this right here. I  will take it out of my billfold. It is a  credit card. You see, what the Republicans have done  is  they have put  America on a credit card. What they  are doing is sort of like: spend and pay  later, feel good. There was an advertisement once for a credit card company that said you can have  it all.  That is what the Republicans are telling us: You can have it all. We are  going to put America on a credit card  society. We can have tax cuts for the  wealthy and the most privileged and  we will put it on a credit card. We can  continue the war in Iraq, brought on by  exaggerations and misinformation to  the tune of about $6 billion a month  now. That is what we are spending in  Iraq. I think it will $200 billion by the  end of this fiscal year. Put it on a credit card. Put it on the credit card. And,  boy, does it feel good. We can have everything. We can have it all. That is  what Republicans are telling us. All  you have to do is go in debt, put it on  the credit card, put it on the country’s  credit card. We all know what is going  to happen. When you are running up  the credit card, boy, it feels good.  Who is getting all the advantages of  this credit card, though? The wealthiest among us who got all these big tax  cuts, and they are now shopping at  Neiman Marcus. Check it out. High-end  stores, the high-end catalogs are doing  very well. People are buying expensive  trinkets,  expensive watches, yachts,  and everything else. They made out.  Guess where it is coming from. It is  on your credit card, America. It is on  your credit card. And who will be paying? Working families. And now they  want us to extend the credit card limit  one more time.  You see, they bumped against the  limit on the credit card, so now they  are saying we have to extend the limit.  That is what all this is about. You have  to put it in real-life terms. This is a  real-life credit card. You know what  your limit is, you know what your income is, and you know what happens if  you exceed your credit card limit and  you cannot pay it. What happens? What  happens when you cannot meet the  payments? You either declare bankruptcy and go to bankruptcy court, or  your creditors come after you. They restructure you. They deny you certain  things so that you can start to pay off  your credit card debt.  Guess who is now taking our credit  card debt. The top countries holding  our credit card debt are Japan, China,  South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Hong  Kong, Switzerland, OPEC—the oil producing and exporting countries have a  lot of our debt—China. I do not mean  to castigate China. I happen to like the  Chinese people. I think we ought to  trade with China, although in a more  balanced way. But what happens when  they become a big creditor and we are  their debtor? What happens to trade  deals down the road?  Put yourself and your family in this  position. What happens when you are  the debtor and you have a creditor?  Who tells whom what to do? Does the  debtor tell the creditor what to do?  Your creditor tells you what you have  to do to get out of debt.  So what is going to happen a few  years from now when we are having a  trade deal with China, when we are trying to hammer it out and the Chinese  do not like exactly how we are dealing?  What happens when they are keeping  the value of their currency artificially  low? The debtor tends to pull their  punch when dealing with the creditor.  And we have been pulling our punches  in this situation.  This is not some fancy kind of thing.  I have heard some speeches on the floor  today about the debt limit. Look, this  is family. This is the American family  we are talking about, and the Republicans are selling us out to creditors  around the world. And now that we  have bumped up against the limit on  our credit card, they say we are going  to raise the limit one more time. We  can put more debt on our credit card:  $800 billion more. Think of it as another $11,000 for a family of four.  Two things are happening. First is  you have to pay interest, right? When  you have debt on your credit card, you  pay interest on that credit card debt.  You pay it every month or you start  paying interest on the interest. Guess  what. You will have to pay it. That is  what is happening to our national debt.  We raise the limit on our credit card,  and every month we have to pay interest or what it build and build.  How much  interest? Every man,  woman, and child in America will, by  2009, be paying $1,000 a year in taxes  just to pay the interest on the national  debt; $4,000 for a family of four, every  year, just to pay the interest on the  debt. And, Mr. President, that is not  one tax that can be cut. You cannot  cut that tax. That has to be paid. The  interest has to be paid on the debt—  $4,000 a year for a family of four.  I have heard a lot of talk around here  this year and in previous years—and  now I hear the President of the United  States talking about it again—about  the death tax, otherwise known as the  estate tax, which is if you have a big  estate, over $1.5 million dollars, before  you pass it on, you have to pay taxes  on the amount over that sum. They got  to calling it this fancy death tax, like  you are taxed because you die. You are  not taxed because you die, you are  taxed because you have large holdings  that have built up, a lot of which you  have not paid taxes on, that you can  pass on to other generations in your  family. They call it a death tax.  I think we ought to start talking  about the birth tax. That is what is  happening on the floor today. Increasing our national debt is putting a birth  tax on every child born in America.

1764,242,2004-11-17,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, today I  join with my constituents  in recognizing the brave men of the 66th Infantry Division.  Sixty years ago on November 15, 1944,  the soldiers left from New York Harbor  on the USAT George Washington without knowledge of their destination. It  turned out  the USAT George Washington brought the soldiers to England,  where they were stationed at Southampton Harbor until Christmas Eve  1944.  On Dec. 16, 1944, the Nazis launched a  desperate  offensive  in Belgium  intended to split the Allied Forces. The  fierce struggle became known as ‘‘The  Battle of the Bulge.’’ As part of the allied response to this threat, on Christmas Eve 1944 over 2,000 American soldiers of the 66th Infantry Division stationed  in England were  rushed  to  Southampton, where they boarded the  troopship SS Leopoldville. The troops  were  then  transported  across  the  English Channel, but  just  51⁄2miles  from  their  destination,  Cherbourg,  France, the vessel was torpedoed by  the German submarine U–486.  Some of the soldiers were killed instantly, some went down with the ship,  some safely jumped from the ship’s rail  to the rescue craft that pulled alongside, while others missed the  jump,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:14 Jan 29, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:€4SENATE\S17NO4.REC S17NO4 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2004

1785,263,2004-11-17,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the contributions of Chief Richard L. Word of  the Oakland Police Department  in Oakland,  California. After more  than  two decades of  dedicated service, Chief Word will be leaving  the Oakland area, and I would like to take this  opportunity to recognize his contributions not  only to the Police Department, but to the community as a whole.  Born  and  reared  in  San  Francisco’s  Ingleside District, Chief Word graduated from  Riordan High School  in 1980. Following his  time at Riordan, where he excelled academically and was a valued leader in the campus’  Black Student Union, Chief Word attended  San Francisco State University as well as the  University of San Francisco. He then devoted  two years to the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department as a cadet and subsequently entered  the Oakland Police Academy, where he would  go on to become the valedictorian of the 1984  recruiting class.  Following his graduation, Chief Word rose  quickly  through  the  ranks of Sergeant and  Lieutenant before being promoted to Captain  in 1997 and was later sworn in as Oakland’s  Chief of Police on July 2, 1999. As the Chief  of Police for the past five years, Chief Word  has been a distinguished  leader  in many  ways. Not only was he the youngest Chief in  the Oakland Police Department’s history, but  his selection was also one of the first steps  taken by Mayor Jerry Brown as part of his  plan to dramatically reduce crime rates in the  City of Oakland. In working to reach this goal,  Chief Word employed a number of methods  and strategies, such as strengthening the Department’s Crime Analysis Section, assigning  more officers to the field, and building closer  ties to Oakland’s neighborhoods through community policing, the use of joint problem-solving programs by community policing officers  and neighborhood residents, and  the establishment of  the Youth Citizens Police Academy, which is comprised of youth from all of  Oakland’s high schools.  In addition to his work within the Police Department, Chief Word is involved with a number of community and professional organizations. He sits on the Board of Directors of the  Oakland Chapter of the American Red Cross,  the Boys and Girls Clubs of Oakland, and the  California Police Chiefs Association. He also  serves as Vice President of  the Alameda  County Police Chiefs’ and Sheriffs’ Association, and is a member of both the International  Association of Chiefs of Police and  the National Black Forum of Black Public Administrators. In addition to his accomplishments within  the police  force, Chief Word also earned a  bachelor’s degree  in business administration  from John F. Kennedy University, from which  he graduated cum laude, and a master’s degree in public administration from Golden Gate  University. Furthermore, he completed the FBI  National Academy, and  recently graduated  from the FBI National Executive Institute.  On November 12, 2004, Chief Word will be  honored  in Oakland, California  for  twenty  years of outstanding service  to  the Oakland  Police Department and  the City of Oakland.  This occasion is an opportunity for us to recognize him not only for his service within the  Police Department,  but  also  for  his  outstanding  leadership on  the  issues of crime  prevention and the development of community  partnerships between law enforcement officers  and neighborhood residents. By remaining active  in and dedicated  to  these vital areas,  Chief Word has contributed enormously to the  City of Oakland and California’s 9th Congressional District. I salute and congratulate Chief  Word for his many years of invaluable service. f  RECOGNIZING ADMIRAL RICHARD  TRULY ON HIS RETIREMENT AS  DIRECTOR  OF  THE  NATIONAL  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  LABORATORY  HON. BOB BEAUPREZ  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 17, 2004 ",2004
1786,263,2004-11-17,Mr. BEAUPREZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to a great American. At the end  of this year, after a lifetime of dedicated service to his country, Admiral Richard Truly will  be stepping down as Director of the National  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located  in Golden, Colorado.  As many of you know, NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy’s premier laboratory for renewable energy  research and development  and a leading laboratory for energy efficiency  research. Since  first being elected  to Congress two years ago, I have had the distinct  pleasure of representing NREL and the many  talented and dedicated employees that work at  the  lab. Through  the  leadership of Admiral  Truly, NREL has continued to be at the forefront of new scientific discoveries, developing  new energy technologies to benefit both the  environment and the economy.  I first became acquainted with Richard Truly  through his position as Director of NREL, but  as I later learned this is but one of the many  great contributions he has made to his country  in his storied career as a public servant. Prior  to his service at NREL, Admiral Truly served  as NASA’s eighth Administrator under President Bush  from 1989–92, and his career  in  aviation and space programs of the U.S. Navy  and NASA spanned 35 years. He retired as a  Vice Admiral after a Navy career of more than  30 years. As a naval aviator, test pilot and astronaut, he logged over 7,500 hours and made  over 300 carrier arrested  landings, day and  night.  Under his  leadership, NASA matured  the  Space Shuttle, solidified Space Station plans  and  initiated new space science and aeronautics programs. He initiated major acquisition reforms and significantly streamlined the  agency. He continually placed a very strong  emphasis on NASA’s math and science educational programs. In recognition of these accomplishments, President Reagan awarded  the Presidential Citizen’s Medal  to Admiral  Truly in 1989.  While I am quite certain that the great works  that Admiral Truly and his staff have been  able to accomplish since he began serving as  Director of NREL in May of 1997 will continue  under new  leadership,  the next Director will  certainly have big shoes to fill.  Again,  I want  to congratulate him  for his  many outstanding years of public service.  I  wish both him and his wife many years of happiness as they move into this new stage of  their lives. f  HONORING NEW JERSEY BLOOD  SERVICES  HON. MIKE FERGUSON  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, November 17, 2004 ",2004
1787,263,2004-11-17,Mr. FERGUSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the members of New Jersey’s Blood  Services on their 30th Anniversary.  Since September 1973, New Jersey Blood  Services has been serving  the  residents of  New Jersey by collecting blood, holding blood  drives and recruiting donors. NJBS has collected more than 2.2 million blood donations  throughout its 30-year history, has developed  important relationships with the American Red  Cross and  fostered several partnerships  to  provide health services throughout the State of  New Jersey.  NJBS  has  pioneered  efforts  in mobile  aphaeresis collections that have gained the attention of collection organizations  throughout  the country. The group also has piloted several programs  to ensure  the safety of both  blood donors and recipients. Its efforts, combined with those of New Jersey-based businesses, have lead to tremendous success in  local blood drives to provide for New Jerseys’  blood needs.  Mr. Speaker, I commend all Americans who  work hard to support the blood supply needs  of the United States. These men and women  work  tirelessly  to protect and preserve  the  lives and health of their fellow citizens.  I ask my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the New Jersey Blood Service for  its 30 years of service to our communities. f  HONORING STAFF SERGEANT  THEODORE ‘‘SAM’’ HOLDER II  HON.

1790,72,2004-12-07,Mr. LINDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), chairman of the Committee  on the Judiciary.  ",2004
1791,72,2004-12-07,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in opposition to the conference report. The House-passed bill  not  only  reformed  our  intelligence  community,  it also secured our borders. Unfortunately, the conference has  left us with an incomplete product that  does not secure our border and, thus,  makes us more vulnerable to another  terrorist attack.  At the beginning of this process I  said that the object of this legislation  should be to prevent a future attack on  the United States, not to manage the  consequences of that attack. This bill  does not do that. And the reason it  does not do that is that while we will  have better  intelligence, good  intelligence is useless without good homeland security.  The House bill followed the 9/11 Commission’s common-sense recommendation that we have Federal standards for  driver’s licenses. The commission said,  ‘‘For terrorists, travel documents are  as  important  as weapons.’’ Despite  many attempts to keep these weapons  away from terrorists, the bill does not  do the job.  In  fact, the  language  in the conference report is worse than the current law, and it practically invites terrorists to come into our country and to  apply for these critical identification  documents. There is no enforcement or  certification  at  the  national  level.  There is no expiration of the licenses  when the visas expire. There is no datasharing between the States. And any  State can simply walk away from the  few requirements that are in the bill.  That does not sound like driver’s license reform to me. Rather it sounds  like a recipe  for disaster, the same  kind of disaster that occurred on 9/11.  Remember that the 9/11 hijackers had  multiple validly issued State driver’s  licenses among them, and that is how  they got on the airplanes. That is what  we were trying to stop by changing the  provisions  in  the conference  report,  and I regret that we failed. But I can  assure you that this issue is not going  to go away.  We have also failed on asylum reform. Many terrorist aliens have applied for asylum and then have been released from detention to plot or commit their crimes. That must stop, and  the provisions in the House bill would  have done  that, but  they  too were  dropped.  Terrorists are getting asylum today  for two main reasons. First, our government cannot even ask foreign governments what  evidence  they  have  about terrorist activities of asylum applicants. Thus, the U.S. Government  must usually oppose asylum requests  by arguing that the applicant is lying.  The  Ninth  Circuit  has  effectively  barred immigration judges from denying asylum claims on the basis of the  credibility of witness statements. That  is crazy, because every  jury  in the  country judges the credibility of the  witnesses in determining the guilt or  innocence of the defendant. The House  bill would have stopped that and removed that bar. The conference report  does not.  In addition, the Ninth Circuit has  been granting asylum to applicants because their home government believes  they are terrorists. It then says, therefore they are being persecuted because  of the political beliefs of the relevant  terrorist organizations. That is goofy.  The House stopped it, but the Senate  would not go along; and the conference  report fails to deal with this issue.  These provisions are not too controversial. They are not  irrelevant.  They are vital. And how could we face  grieving families in the future and tell  them that while we might have done  more, the legislative hurdles were just  too high? I, for one, cannot, and, therefore, oppose the bill.  I have heard from many citizens from  my district and across the country who  understand and want these provisions,  and I thank them for their support. I  want to say to them, and to everyone  else that is listening, I will not rest  VerDate jul 14 2003  03:05 Dec 08, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K07DE7.022 H07PT1 ",2004
1792,79,2004-12-07,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER), a conferee on the  bill.  ",2004
1793,79,2004-12-07,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentleman for his hard work.  Mr. Speaker, for the House, walking  through  this  conference  report has  been largely a defensive action, if you  will, a holding action; and I want to  compliment all of the great Members  of the House who managed to hold off  what initially was a political stampede  that would have passed a piece of legislation that would have accrued to the  detriment of the people who wear the  uniform of the United States and, I  think, to our intelligence apparatus.  We had to walk back things  like  opening up the top line, the classified  top line to the world, letting our adversaries know how much we spend on intelligence. We had to walk back this  idea that somehow we were going to  send the money for the combat support  agencies around the Department of Defense, not allow the Department of Defense to have a normal working relationship with its own combat support  agencies. In fact, it took a letter from  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Myers, to the conferees to say the  House position is the right position, to  back off some of those who were stampeding  in the wrong direction. Ultimately, we had to address this most  important issue: chain of command.  Now,  interestingly, before this bill  was brought up on the other side of the  Hill, on the Senate side, the President  sent a strong message saying we must  have  chain-of-command  language  to  make sure that there is no confusion  about lines of execution. The authors  of the bill on the other side did not put  that language in. My counterpart, Senator JOHNWARNER, chairman of the  Senate Armed  Services  Committee,  then saying that he was afraid that  this bill did violate and intrude on the  chain of command, offered an amendment to establish what the administration wanted, to establish strong chainof-command language that would ensure  that  a  battlefield  commander  would have all the assets in his area of  operation  for  his  combatant  commands.  Senator WARNER’s  language  was rejected by the leadership of this  bill on the Senate side.  As we got into the conference, the  administration sent another message.  They said, you know, you forgot something. You  forgot  the chain-of-command language. Once again, it was not  included. When it finally was included,  it was accompanied by weasel words  which basically invalidated the entire  section. On several occasions the conferees on the other side changed the  weasel words, but they still had a provision which basically violated the entire section, or invalidated the entire  section, and left us with nothing.  So, in the end, 17 days ago when we  were asked  in  the Republican  conference what we thought about this  bill, I and many other people had to  speak up and point out that this very  important chain of command was not  protected in the conference report and  needed to be protected.  In the end, on Saturday night, we  sent to Senator COLLINS’ staff a chainof-command provision to respect and  not abrogate the chain of command,  citing the statutes that are relevant,  to Senator COLLINS through her chief  of staff. He said she would get back  Monday morning. She did get back and  approved  that  section. And we  said  that when I saw that in writing in an  amendment to the conference report, I  would then support the conference. We  have gotten that today, and I have  signed the conference report.  This bill, now, with these changes,  including  classifying  the  top  line,  walking back this wild attempt to remove the Department of Defense from  its own budget flow to its combat support agencies and, finally, this attempt  to keep the chain of command in a position where it was questionable; having walked back all of those attempts  to change this bill in a manner that  would accrue to the detriment of the  men and women who wear the uniform  of the United States and moving instead to a situation in which they are  protected, with a solid insulation in  the chain of command so a combat  commander in Afghanistan or Iraq can  now count on being able to use all of  his assets in that theater to protect his  troops and perform his mission; having  done that, this bill, in my estimation,  is now acceptable, and I am supporting  this bill. I am going to vote for this  bill.  I agree  fully with  the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER)  and others who think that the driver’s  license issue is of great importance. It  is of great importance. We need to get  that issue up and through as soon as  possible. ",2004

Mr. Speaker, we are making history  today. This  conference  report  represents the most profound government  reform to date for meeting the unique  and daunting security challenges existing in this era of terror. This bill fundamentally overhauls the structure of  our Nation’s intelligence community.  It represents an important step in the  improvement of our government’s intelligence capabilities while, at  the  same time, preserving our ability to  ensure that our own military personnel  have the intelligence information they  need  to  succeed on  the battlefield.  More broadly, Mr. Speaker, this bill  promises to advance our abilities in the  global fight against terrorism.  From my vantage point as the ranking member  of  the Committee  on  Armed Services,  this conference  includes  two  important  legislative  achievements. First, it creates and empowers a new Director of National Intelligence to set the vision, direction,  and  priorities  for  the  entire  intelligence community.

1797,86,2004-12-07,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  distinguished ranking member and the  chairman of our committee  for  the  work that they have done together. I  think the American people are proud.  This has been a very tough journey  to arrive here  tonight with a conference  report  to  reform  the  intelligence community of our country. And  yet we know, and all Americans know,  that the status quo is not good enough.  The  status  quo has  been  in  place  throughout the Cold War and post–Cold  War. Yet ever since our country was  attacked,  there  is not anyone  that  could say that all systems were running the way they should.  And so with gratitude to the families  of the victims, who, as our leader said  a few moments ago, have inspired us  and  inspired  the  country, with  the  President supporting the bill, with the  leadership of both parties supporting  the bill, with the support and the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission,  who did such superb work for the people of our country, there is no reason  why  the House  of Representatives  should not vote in its entirety in support of this bill that reforms our intelligence community.  I think it falls short on oversight,  and that should be taken up in the new  Congress because it is an important,  critical role of the Congress. But I am  very proud to stand with my colleagues  and the Democrats who introduced an  inspirational bill 8 months and 6 days  ago  that mirrored  the  recommendations of the commission. I urge all my  colleagues to support this bill.  ",2004
1798,86,2004-12-07,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume to  make two quick points.  One is, indeed, most of the people  who were here, most of the hijackers  were here  illegally, not  legally, because they fraudulently produced documents to get their visas. The visas  were  frauds  to begin with, making  them illegal aliens in this country.  Secondly, many of them had overstayed their visas or were doing something here that was not allowed under  the visa, making them illegal aliens in  this country. So, indeed, they were illegal.  Thirdly, there are far more members  of 9/11 families who oppose this bill because the provisions we are talking  about here are missing; those provisions to secure our borders are missing.  Far more oppose this bill in its present  form than support it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  ROYCE).  ",2004
1799,86,2004-12-07,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I do not  know why we set up a 9/11 Commission  if we were not going to take their provisions in their entirety.  When the 9/11 Commission tells us  that border security is national security; when the commission finds that  our border system has two systemic  weaknesses, a lack of a well-developed  counterterrorism measure as a part of  border security and, to quote them,  ‘‘an immigration system not able to  deliver on its basic commitments when  they look at the case of Mohammed  Atta and others and then find and tell  us that targeting their travel  is at  least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money, and  then lays out a plan for our U.S. border  security to be reformed, and we pick up  those reforms, put them in the House  bill that we pass over to the Senate  and now find that those very reforms  are stripped out, I do not know how we  back away from that argument. Border  security is national security; how we  acquiesce to those that say no, you  cannot touch border security.  You know, I do not know with certainty that moving around the organizational boxes of the intelligence community will make  things better.  It  may. But one thing we can be sure of is  that  the  driver’s  license  provisions  that have been stripped at the insistence of the other body would have  made a difference. Driver’s  licenses  were the 9/11 terrorists’ license to kill  and to kill massively. We know that.  They had 63 of these driver’s licenses  between them, for the 19 of them. And  these  identification documents gave  these hijackers unfettered access  to  nearly everything they needed to plan  and carry out their attacks on Washington, D.C. and on New York City.  And the identification cards also allowed them to remain in the country  with the appearance of legitimacy long  after their visas had expired and their  presence in the United States became  illegal.  Sixty-eight  percent  of  this  body  voted for these reforms and 87 percent  of the American people support them.  They should be in the bill. ",2004

1802,93,2004-12-07,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to express my frustration at the increasing disconnect between what  the American  people believe is critical for improving our national  security and what  those  inside  the  Washington Beltway believe, particularly with  regard to illegal immigration.  On the floor for our consideration is legislation  to enact portions of  recommendations  from the 9–11 Commission. Unfortunately, the  bill omits significant 9–11 Commission  recommendations regarding stricter enforcement  of immigration laws and securing our borders.  The 9–11  terrorists exploited our  immigration system in order to carry out the murder of  over  three  thousand Americans. Yet,  today,  due to opposition of these critical provisions  by certain members of the U.S. Senate, the  legislation before us today is silent on closing  these immigration loopholes. The 9–11 Commissioners all have publicly called  for Congress to enact serious immigration reform. The  fact that illegal immigrants can enter our country and obtain driver licenses and ‘‘game the  system’’  to  remain concealed  from  law enforcement is an affront to all Americans and  endangers our security.  Does anyone  think  that our enemies will  cease to look for and exploit weaknesses in  our defenses? Does anyone think they will not  look to continue exploiting the loopholes in our  immigration laws? Does anyone think it makes  us safer to keep the status quo?  Today,  is  the day we should be passing  these reforms, not next year, and not after the  next terror attack.  This bill will pass today, but it will do so with  significant security gaps. I believe it is critical  that we address the omissions from this bill as  soon as possible. We cannot afford to put off  these critical national security needs. ",2004
1803,93,2004-12-07,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in support of S. 2845, that would  implement  the recommendations of  the 9/11  Commission. At  long  last bipartisanship and  the will of  the American people are at  the  brink of success here in the House of Representatives. This reform is now long overdue  and this issue is too important to suffer the  petty partisan games  the House  leadership  have played with this bill. I only hope that our  delay does not come at a higher cost than the  few bruised egos of those unwilling and unable to work in a bipartisan manner the way  our country’s Framers always intended when  the national security of this great Nation was  threatened.  It should also not be lost on any Member of  this Chamber that we are here debating this  legislation today, December 7, on the anniversary of another day of infamy, which like 9/11  forever  changed  the  future  course of  this  country and generations of Americans. As we  honor and discuss those who were lost on 9/ 11  today,  I would  like  to  take a moment  to  also remember those lost today at Pearl Harbor  in 1941 and  the sacrifices made by so  many  families and Americans since  then  to  defend this Nation.  The recommendations the bipartisan Commission released in July 2004 will help prevent  future  terrorist attacks by offering a global  strategy to dismantle terrorists and their organizations, prevent the continued growth of terrorism, and prepare for future terrorist attacks.  In October,  the other body overwhelmingly  passed the National Intelligence Reform Act,  S. 2845, by a vote of 96 to 2. The Bush administration,  the 9/11 Commission chairmen,  and  families of many September 11 victims  fully endorsed the Senate’s intelligence reorganization bill.  Unfortunately, there in the House, the People’s Chamber,  the Republican  leadership  chose a different path, a path that strayed far  from  the 9/11 Commission’s  recommendations. In yet another example of party politics  over public  interest,  the Republican majority  drafted a 609-page intelligence bill, H.R. 10,  without any input or support from the Democratic  leadership,  including  in  it controversial  provisions not recommended by the Commission on  immigration and  surveillance, and  even went as  far as  to exempt  the United  States  from certain applications of  the 1984  United Nations Convention Against Torture.  When Democrats put  forward  the bipartisan  Senate bill as an amendment during the debate, it was defeated along party lines 203– 213. Only 8 Republican Members of  this  House voted for the bipartisan bill.  For over a month, no interest was shown by  House  leaders  in negotiating with  the bipartisan supporters backed by President Bush  and the 9/11 families, and the bill languished  in  the conference committee. Finally  in November, blowing  to public pressure, House  Republican leaders worked out a compromise  with  the President and  the bipartisan supporters of  the Senate bill, and many of us  thought  that  finally we would see action on  this needed reform. However, several Members of the Republican House majority refused  to accept the compromise and despite overwhelming support in the House and no question that the bill would pass if brought to the  floor, the Speaker refused to allow a vote on  the bill  rather  than have  it pass with more  Democratic support than Republican.  Instead, we waited nearly another entire  month, while public pressure forced the President to finally personally work to try and convince enough Republican holdouts to support  the bill, no not that it will pass, because there  have always been enough votes to pass the  bill, but to ensure that at the end of the vote  there would be more Republican yes votes,  who hold  the majority anyway,  than Democratic yes votes  While we waited for Republicans to be able  to say they passed the intelligence reform bill  themselves without needing any Democratic  support, another U.S. Consulate office,  this  time in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia was attacked by  terrorists, killing five people and wounding thirteen others. I fear how many more such attacks our enemies have been able to organize  while we have delayed enacting  intelligence  reform needed to combat their activities.  This effort should mark a beginning, not the  end, of our efforts  to protect  the American  people by strengthening the systems by which  we collect, process, and disseminate  intelligence. However, the price of liberty is eternal  vigilance, and as this Congress works to balance the need for greater security while protecting liberty, I would remind my colleagues  of the words of one of our nation’s greatest  founders, Benjamin Franklin, who said, ‘‘They  that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor  safety.’’ I hope  that  the Republican  leadership will  not tarnish this achievement today by agreeing  to vote in the next Congress on efforts that will  weaken and undermine Americans’ liberties.

Apparently  they did not.  We could have passed this legislation under  regular order before  the election. We could  have approved  this  legislation under regular  order before Thanksgiving. But  the House  leadership has brought us to the point where  we do not all have the opportunity to read this  bill to determine what effects it will have on  our constituents.

1805,114,2004-12-07,Mr. LATOURETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I  offer an amendment in the nature of a  substitute.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment in the nature of a substitute  offered by Mr. LATOURETTE: Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American  Bald Eagle Recovery and National Emblem  Commemorative Coin Act’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS.  The Congress finds as follows:  (1) The bald eagle was designated as the  national emblem of the United States on  June 20, 1782, by our country’s Founding Fathers at the Second Continental Congress.  (2) The bald eagle is the greatest visible  symbol of the spirit of freedom and democracy in the world.  (3) The bald eagle species  is unique to  North America and represents the American  values and attributes of freedom, courage,  strength, spirit,  loyalty,  justice, equality,  democracy, quality, and excellence.  (4) The bald eagle is the central image used  in the Great Seal of the United States and  the seal of many branches and departments  of the United States Government, including  the President and the Vice President of the  United States, the United States Congress,  the Department of Defense, the Department  of the Treasury, the Department of Justice,  the Department of State, the Department of  Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Postal Service.  (5) The bald eagle’s image and symbolism  have played a profound role in establishing  and honoring American beliefs and traditions.  (6) The bald eagle’s image and symbolism  have influenced American art, music, history, literature, commerce, and culture since  the founding of our Nation.  (7) The bald eagle species was once threatened with possible extinction in the lower 48  States but is now making a gradual, encouraging recovery within America’s lands, waterways, and skies.  (8) The bald eagle was federally classified  as an ‘‘endangered’’ species in 1973 under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973, and, in 1995,  was removed from the ‘‘endangered’’ species  list and upgraded  to  the  less  imperiled  ‘‘threatened’’ status under such Act.  (9) The administration is likely to officially delist the bald eagle from both the  ‘‘endangered’’ and ‘‘threatened’’ species lists  under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 by  no later than 2008.  (10) The initial recovery of the bald eagle  population in the United States was accomplished by the vigilant efforts of numerous  caring agencies, corporations, organizations,  and citizens.  (11) The continued caring and concern of  the American people and the further restoration and protection of the bald eagle and its  habitat is necessary to guarantee the full recovery and survival of this precious national  treasure for future generations.  (12) Since the Endangered Species Act of  1973 requires that delisted species be administratively monitored for a 5-year period, the  bald eagle nests in 49 States will require continual monitoring after the bald eagle is removed from the protection of such Act; and  such efforts will require substantial funding  to the Federal and State agencies and private organizations that will conduct such  monitoring.

A member  of the 144th Transportation Company  of the Florida Army National Guard,  Specialist Davis was killed November  29, 2004 when his Humvee was involved  in an accident traveling between military camps in Iraq.

Daryl Davis graduated  from Spencer High school and enlisted  in the Iowa National Guard at age 17  before transferring to Florida earlier  this year. Specialist Davis is survived  by his mother and father, Dana Davis  and Richard Rosado, as well as two  brothers. I know that he will be deeply  missed by his family and friends. My  thoughts and prayers are with them.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate  and my fellow Americans to join me in  remembering Specialist Davis and the  enormous  sacrifice he made  for his  country. Many people  thought very  highly of Specialist Davis and he will  always be remembered for his willingness to serve others.

1821,142,2004-12-07,Mr. HAGEL.," Mr. President, I rise to  express my sympathy over the loss of  Nick Nolte of Falls City, NE, a sergeant  in  the United States Marine  Corps. Sergeant Nolte died November  24, 2004 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center from wounds he received on  November 9 when his Humvee drove  over a bomb near Baghdad, Iraq. He  was 25 years old.  Sergeant Nolte graduated from Falls  City Sacred Heart High School in 1998.  After graduating, he enlisted  in the  U.S. Marine Corps and became a member  of  the  Presidential Helicopter  Squadron HMX–1, guarding Presidents  Clinton and Bush. In June 2004, Nolte  joined Operation Iraqi Freedom as a rifleman, Marine and personal security  expert. Sergeant Nolte will be remembered as a loyal Marine who believed in  his mission and who had a strong sense  of duty, honor and  love of country.  Thousands of brave Americans  like  Sergeant Nolte are currently serving in  Iraq.  Sergeant Nolte  is survived by his  mother, Anita Nolte; his wife, Melina  and  3-year-old  daughter, Alanna  of  Cherry Point, NC and sister, Jessica  Nolte of Omaha. Our  thoughts and  prayers are with them at this difficult  time. The United States of America is  proud  of Nick Nolte’s  service  and  mourns his loss.  For his service, bravery and sacrifice,  I ask my colleagues to join me and all  Americans in honoring Sergeant Nick  Nolte.  STAFFSERGEANTROBERTS. DOUGHTY  ",2004
1822,142,2004-12-07,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  rise today to pay tribute to a Kentucky  hero, SSG Robert S. Doughty. Sergeant  Doughty, an 11-year-veteran of the U.S.  Army and from Paducah, KY, went to  Iraq last spring as a member of the 3rd  Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group.  On July 8, 2004, Sergeant Doughty was  riding  in  the  passenger  seat  of  a  Humvee deep in the Sunni Triangle.  His  team’s mission was  to  deliver  laptop computers and a new vehicle to  another Special Forces  team. They  didn’t make it.  A  155mm-mortar  struck  Sergeant  Doughty’s  vehicle.  Shrapnel  tore  through both of his legs. Two medics  began treating him immediately, and  Sergeant Doughty believes they saved  his life by preventing him from bleeding to death. He was rushed by helicopter to a surgical hospital in Balad,  Iraq, then to Germany, and finally to  Walter Reed Army Medical Center here  in the Nation’s Capital. Doctors were  able to save his life, but not his legs.  Sergeant Doughty’s incredible courage has not diminished one iota since  that July day. Two months to the day  of that vicious attack, he stood for the  first time on two prosthetic legs. Since  then, he has graduated from using a  walker to crutches to canes, and intends to walk without difficulty by  Christmas. I have no doubt he will succeed.  I had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant Doughty and his family in my office on September 9. I told him how  grateful America is for his service to  our country. This amazing man has not  let his injury hamper his love for his  country, her military, or the cause of  freedom and  justice we  fight  for  in  Iraq. If he could, he would go back. He  serves as a model of heroism to us all.  Today I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring SSG Robert S. Doughty for  his supreme valor. My prayers, and  those of millions of grateful Americans, are with him as he recovers from  his injuries. With other fine men and  women like him in our Armed Forces,  we are sure to succeed as we continue  ridding the newly liberated Iraq of the  terrorists trying to drive that country  back into the hands of tyranny.  LCPLJOSEPHWELKE  ",2004
1823,142,2004-12-07,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to LCpl Joseph T.  Welke, a resident of Rapid City, SD  who died on November 20, 2004, while  serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Lance Corporal Welke was a member  of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Marine  Regiment  based  out  of Camp Pendleton, CA. He was killed while fighting insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq.  Answering America’s call to the military, Lance Corporal Welke joined the  Marines after graduating from Rapid  City Stevens High School in 2003. As a  fullback for the varsity football team,  Joe earned Greater Dakota All Conference team honors. He enjoyed riding  his motorcycle and spending time with  his family. Friends and family remember him as having a love for life and as  an inspiration to all those who knew  him best.  Lance Corporal Welke  served  our  country and, as a hero, died fighting  for it. He served as model of the loyalty and dedication that comes with  preservation of freedom. The thoughts  and prayers of my family, as well as  the rest of the country, are with his  family during this time of mourning.

1832,149,2004-12-07,Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.," Mr. President, my 18-year tenure in the Senate  has capped an extremely satisfying personal experience with great rewards  and  gratification  of  public  service.  These have been some of the most significant  influences on my  life. The  greatest influence, of course, has been  my family.  I was born into a family with good  values and an admiration for education  and an interest in politics. In February  of 1936, my mother and father made  two significant decisions. First, my father, who was a mining engineer by  education and a dairy farmer by occupation, a man who had become extremely distressed at the level of underworld corruption in Dade County,  FL, decided  to  run  for  the Florida  State Senate to represent that county  on a platform of cleaning up underworld corruption.  The second decision my parents made  in February of 1936 was to have a baby.  I was the happy result of that second  decision. My mother says that I came  by my political  instincts  from  the  womb, that she spent her whole pregnancy going to political activities and  that I became addicted.  Throughout my public career, I have  had the love and support of my partner  of 45 years, Adele. No person in public  life could have a more loving, a more  caring, and a more contributing partner than I.  At one point, Adele used to be nervous in public settings. Today, I wish I  had her calm, her persuasiveness, her  effectiveness  in public  settings. Together, we have had the privilege of  raising four wonderful daughters, two  of whom were born after our first election to public office.  All of those qualities have been enhanced during my Senate years, including the addition of 11 grandchildren. On  Thanksgiving Day I shared a special  tradition with  9 of  those  11 grandchildren when they joined me here at  this desk on the Senate floor and observed and critiqued my  skills—and  lack of skills—as I carved my name  into the Senate desk.  The second greatest influence is my  home, the State of Florida. I thought I  knew a lot about Florida as a native  and as a two-term Governor, but I have  learned so much more during the last  18 years. Since 1974, I have been taking  different  jobs,  jobs alongside  fellow  Floridians, and as of last Thursday I  have done 406 of these workdays; 214 of  them have been done since I became a  Member of the Senate. Even though my  day job is 1,000 miles away from where  many Floridians live, these workdays  have been an important part of maintaining a close relationship with my  fellow Floridians and  reminding me  what our priorities should be on their  behalf here in Washington. Workdays  and my experiences in Congress have  taught me ways in which the Federal  Government affects the lives of typical  Americans and, most acutely, Floridians.  I come from a State which is marked  with dramatic growth in a very fragile  environment, with a close affiliation  with the countries to the south of the  United States, a State in which one out  of five of our citizens is over the age of  65, and  therefore programs  such as  Medicare and Social Security take on a  very special significance. How we conduct a law-based immigration system  with  humanity  intimately  affects  many of our people, as does the obligation to use power responsibly. All of  these issues I have learned about at  greater depth during my service in the  Senate.  What I have also gained in my three  terms here is an appreciation of the institution of the Senate and the unique  role it plays in balancing our Government in order to avoid excessive power  falling into the hands of any one person or governmental institution.  One of our greatest responsibilities  as Members of the Senate is to assure  an independent judiciary. I am especially pleased that I was able to join  my Florida colleagues in the Senate in  establishing and maintaining a bipartisan, merit-based process by which we  recommended and confirmed applicants  for the Federal judiciary.  Particularly, I am gratified by the  work I did with former Senator Connie  Mack. As a Democrat and as a Republican, we forwarded outstanding judicial candidates to both Democratic and  Republican Presidents. Because  this  process was based on  judicial merit,  Florida nominees have been uniformly  and expeditiously accepted for nomination and confirmation.  I also came to see the Senate as our  country’s best graduate school, offering access to private seminars with the  best and the brightest, supplemented  by outside organizations such as the  Aspen  Institute’s  congressional  program and the InterAmerican Dialog’s  Focus on Hemispheric Issues.  Finally, Mr. President, as with you  and your father, I came to appreciate  the people of the Senate. Simply put, I  enjoy being around politicians and the  people who love politics, including my  staff and the family of the Senate, and  including the journalists who cover our  activities. I value my relationship with  each of my colleagues, and I wish I had  the time to tell a story about each of  you.  Mr. President, your father was one of  the first people I met when I came into  the Senate. We had a number of things  in  common  in our background and  quickly formed a friendship which was  one of the most significant parts, particularly, of my early years in the Senate. My grief at his loss is diluted by  the knowledge not only that he has  VerDate Aug 04 2004  01:52 Dec 08, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A07DE6.010 S07PT1 ",2004
1833,163,2004-12-07,Mr. BURNS.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to pay tribute to the Government of Aruba, a leader in the fight to  stop the flow of terrorist funds in the  Caribbean and Latin America. There  can be no doubt that terrorism is the  defining challenge of the Nation since  9–11. While I have always believed that  the United States must boldly and confidently lead the way in this brutal war  we find ourselves in, I believe that help  from our allies is essential to stop the  financial networks that support terrorism.  One of the most important fronts in  the war on terror concerns the funding  mechanisms that support terrorist activities, including underground financial systems, illicit charities, and corrupt financial service providers. Financiers, fundraisers, or donors who provide  financial  support  to  terrorists  need to be stopped.  Earlier this year, I had met with the  Prime Minister of Aruba, Mr. Nelson  Oduber. We discussed the international  threat of terrorism and a number of  other  issues. Prime Minister Oduber  stressed his nation’s support for stopping terrorism and his determination  in stopping money laundering and terrorist financing in his nation.  In  fact, Aruba’s  leadership  in this  field started  in 1990 when  it hosted  what became known as the Aruba Drug  Money Laundering Conference, a regional mirror of the Financial Action  Task Force—FATF—launched at  the  Paris G–7 summit of 1989. This started  a process, which eventually led to the  creation of  the Caribbean Financial  Action Task Force—CFATF—an organization that now plays a key role in  the War on Terror. On October 30, 2001,  the FATF adopted eight special recommendations on terrorist  financing  and Aruba has moved to  implement  some of those recommendations.  I pay tribute today to Aruba for joining the United States of America in the  War on Terror.  f  SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT  ",2004
1834,163,2004-12-07,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr. President, as a  former Sacramento County, CA, sheriff’s deputy,  I have, throughout my  congressional career, zealously sought  to ensure the safety and effectiveness  of America’s Federal, tribal, State and  local law enforcement officers. I have  also worked hard to promote a better  understanding and appreciation of law  enforcement’s  extraordinary  service  and sacrifice by the American public.  Underscoring this commitment, I was  proud to have authored a number of  important laws, including the National  Law Enforcement Museum Act  (P.L.  106–492); the Law Enforcement Officers  Safety Act of 2003 (P.L. 108–277); the  Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act (P.L.  106–517); the Cops in School Act of 1998  (P.L. 105–302) and the resolution passed  each year to designate May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I  want to take this opportunity to also  commend my deputy chief of staff and  legislative director, Larry Vigil, for all  of his good work in getting these important initiatives passed on behalf of  law enforcement.  As I conclude my tenure in the U.S.  Senate, I challenge my colleagues and  those who will follow in my footsteps  to continue this valuable and necessary  work to support those brave individuals who are putting their lives at risk  each and every day for our safety and  protection. There are currently some  870,000 sworn law enforcement officers  serving our Nation. Each year, on average, 167 officers are killed in the line of  duty—that is one officer killed somewhere  in America  every  53  hours.  Roughly 58,000 officers are assaulted  each year, resulting in about 17,000 injuries. It is the most dangerous profession in our Nation, and also one of the  most important.  An inscription on the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial, just a  few blocks from here in a place called  Judiciary Square,  says  it best:  ‘‘In  valor there is hope.’’ As long as there  are men and women among us who are  willing to put their lives on the line for  others, there is indeed great hope for  this Nation of ours.  But, it must be remembered that our  officers cannot do their job effectively  or  safely without  the necessary  resources. This means the best possible  training and equipment, especially bullet-resistant vests  for every officer.  Studies have clearly shown that these  vests save police lives. In fact, nearly  3,000 police lives have been saved by  bullet resistant vests since they first  started being used some 30 years ago.  But, another vital resource that our  officers need is the trust and support of  the American public they serve. That  is why one of my proudest achievements as a legislator and former law  enforcement officer was authoring the  law to establish a National Law Enforcement Museum here  in our Nation’s capital. The U.S. Department of  Justice has determined that only about  one out of five Americans has any direct contact with a law enforcement officer during the course of a normal  year, and most of those contacts are  traffic stops. The fact is that most of  our  citizens  draw  their  conclusions  about law enforcement from the fictional works of Hollywood and  the  often sensationalized reporting by the  media. Most Americans do not truly  understand, nor  fully appreciate the  tremendous worth of the law enforcement profession to our Nation.  But all of that will soon change when  the doors of the National Law Enforcement Museum open, which is expected  to happen in 2009. Finally, we will have  a popular destination here  in Washington, DC, devoted to telling law enforcement’s true story of selfless service  and  supreme  sacrifice. Through  some of  the most entertaining and  stimulating exhibit ideas I have ever  seen for a museum, visitors will experience what it is like to walk in the  shoes of a police officer, and to make  split-second,  life-or-death  decisions.  They will understand the vital roles  our officers played in every pivotal moment of our Nation’s history, including  the taming of the Wild West, and the  wars against gangsters, drug lords and  now, terrorists. In short, this museum  will  vastly  increase  public  understanding and support for law enforcement, and the museum’s research repository will contribute greatly to promoting police safety. It will truly be a  must-see destination  in our Nation’s  capital and, appropriately, it will be located right across the street from the  National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial.  I want to commend Craig W. Floyd,  the chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, his  talented staff and dedicated board of  directors for working so hard to make  this museum a reality, just like they  made the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial a reality  in 1991.  Neither of these projects would be successful, though, without the generous  funding provided by citizens and corporations across this country and I am  grateful to see that support pouring in  for the museum.  I pledge my continued full support  for this museum project and I challenge my colleagues to do the same.  That means ensuring that during the  public approval process the integrity  and importance of this museum as a  major  visual  presence  in Judiciary  Square must not be compromised in  any way.  Those dedicated public servants of  the law enforcement profession—especially the more than 16,500 officers who  have made the ultimate sacrifice in the  performance of duty, and their families—deserve no less.  f  ELDER JUSTICE ACT  ",2004
1835,163,2004-12-07,Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.," Mr. President, I wish to commend Senator JOHN  BREAUXand his staff for their excellent  work on the Elder Justice Act. They  have worked long and hard on this legislation, and I share their strong desire  to see it pass the Senate this year.  I would like to share the comments I  received from two Florida attorneys,  Nick Cox and Mark Shalloway, who  have extensive knowledge and experience in elder justice issues.  Nick Cox  is  a  professor  at  the  Stetson University College of Law in  St. Petersburg, where he specializes in  elder consumer protection matters and  works on a  special Federal project  within the Elder Law Center. Mr. Cox,  a former State prosecutor, worked for  Attorneys General Bob Butterworth  and Charlie Crist as their acting central Florida regional deputy and bureau chief of the Economic Crimes Division, which is the Florida Attorney  General’s  consumer  protection unit.

Tim Turner, formerly of Iowa, has been  selected for his photographic skills to  represent  the United States  in  the  First International Culinary Competition. This competition brings together  professional  culinary  photographers  from around the globe to bring to life  the  elements  of wine  and  food  in  unique settings. The artists will be  judged by professional chefs, members  of the press, and the general public.  Mr. Turner began his interest in photography while at Heelen High School  in Sioux City, IA, and pursued it further at the University of Iowa and the  Brooks Institute of Photography. By  combining his passion for cuisine with  his keen eye for photography he has received major recognition for his work.  His photographs have appeared in over  40 cookbooks and he has been nominated three times for the prestigious  Beard Award and  received a Beard  Award for best food photography in a  cookbook.  Commenting about his photograph  selected  for the competition, Turner  stated:  The human touch is vital to the authenticity of the food we eat, the wines we drink  and the heirlooms we treasure. These are the  connections to the heart and soul of mankind. This photograph, uses a patchwork  (quilt) as a metaphor for the connection between food and wine, all are united by tradition, in methods, techniques, knowledge and  cultural influences, passed through the generations. The patchwork (quilt), sewn for the  occasion, was created from scraps of old fabric, clothes and my photographs reproduced  on fabric. Set in a timeless space, the chair  invites the viewer to explore and enjoy.  The competition is being organized  by the Beaujolais winemaking region  of France and  competitors  from  12  countries including Denmark, Sweden,  Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland,  Italy, Norway, Finland, Great  Britain,  and France  are  displaying  their artistic photographs.  I want to encourage my colleagues to  log  on  to  the website  at  http://  lauriers.beaujolais.com/en  to  learn  more about the competition and to  vote for the United States contestant  Tim Turner. The winner will be decided  on February 1, 2005. I ask that you  please join me in supporting Mr. Turner.∑  f  CECELIA FIRE THUNDER  ∑",2004
1837,170,2004-12-07,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to publicly  recognize Cecelia  Fire Thunder, the newly elected president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. Ms.  Fire Thunder is the first woman ever  to hold this distinguished position.  Located on the Pine Ridge Indian  Reservation  in southwest South Dakota and comprised of about 16,000 residents, the Oglala Sioux Tribe elected  Ms. Fire Thunder over Russell Means  by a margin of 648 votes. Traditionally,  the Oglala Sioux Tribe has only been  led  by male  presidents  or  leaders.  Those leaders include historic figures  such as Crazy Horse and Red Cloud.  Ms. Fire Thunder’s election is truly a  momentous occasion, but this accomplishment is not the first example of  her selfless dedication to serving her  community. Ms. Fire Thunder has devoted much of her energy to enriching  the lives of those around her, and now  she will take on an even larger role in  her tribe. Her altruistic vision for her  people is unmatched.  Ms. Fire Thunder was born on the  Pine Ridge Reservation but moved to  California as a young child. Upon her  return  to  the  reservation  24 years  later, she attended nursing school and  became active in an effort to provide  free health care to people unable to afford  it  themselves. Fire Thunder’s  background includes her work at a hospital, for the tribe itself, for state government, and as a private consultant.  Most recently, she served as the education specialist for Cangleska, Inc., a  domestic abuse education and prevention program on the reservation.  President-elect Fire Thunder was inaugurated today and I have faith that  her hard work will be a catalyst for  positive changes in her community. I  congratulate Cecelia Fire Thunder on  her election as the next president of  the Oglala Sioux Tribe in southwest  South Dakota. Ms. Fire Thunder is a  shining example of perseverance and  strength  for her people, and  for all  South Dakota citizens. I have known  Cecelia for some time and I sincerely  look forward to working with her for  many years to come.∑  f  HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE  OF STEPHEN MYERS  ∑",2004
1838,170,2004-12-07,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to publicly thank Stephen R.  Myers for his 32 years as chief investment officer of the South Dakota Investment  Council. Mr. Myers  has  served with distinction as the state investment officer for the State of South  Dakota since September 11, 1972. He  will retire in January to spend more  time with his wife, Mary Lynn.  The South Dakota Legislature created the investment council in 1971 to  manage seven funds, including assets  from  the State’s  retirement  system  and the proceeds from tobacco lawsuit  damages. Mr. Myers invested $65 million during the first year of the council’s existence and had immediate success. In more than three decades the  fund has returned an average of 11.2  percent annually, while  the  capital  markets benchmark is only a 10.5-percent annual return. The assets have  grown to over $7.2 billion, with returns  putting the funds in the top 1 percent  of the Nation’s pension funds. The returns  from  the SDIC’s  investments  allow over 65,000 South Dakotans to retire with financial dignity.  Mr. Myers is a man of passion and integrity who takes his responsibility to  retiring South Dakotans  very  seriously. As he himself has stated, ‘‘When  you’re managing other people’s money,  it simply won’t do to have 99 percent  integrity.’’ Mr. Myers is also humble  and quick to give credit to his co-workers and members of the South Dakota  State Government for their roles in the  SDIC’s success.  In addition to his role as chief investment officer of the South Dakota Investment Council, Stephen  is a co-  founder and past president of the South  Dakota  Investment Society and co-  founder and executive committee member  of  the National Association  of  State Investment Officers. He also received  the National Association  of  State  Investment Officers’ Stoddard  Award for his significant contribution  to the State’s public pensions funds.  After  growing  up  in Pierre, Mr.  Myers  attended  the  University  of  South Dakota, where he met his future  bride. His dedication to and love of the  State of South Dakota is evident and  has led to investments that have positively impacted every South Dakotan,  either directly or indirectly. The State  will miss his leadership, and it is with  honor  that  I  share his accomplishments with my colleagues.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the President  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and a treaty which were referred to the  appropriate committees.

1839,212,2004-12-07,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor George Strydio for his support and  remarkable work in helping others who are living with cancer. Mr. Strydio was honored at  the Bayonne Community Mental Health Center’s cocktail reception on October 27, 2004, in  Bayonne, NJ.  At the age of 67, Mr. Strydio underwent a  life-changing experience during a battle with  non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a  type of cancer.  After surviving chemotherapy, several cases of  pneumonia, and other health complications, including  learning how  to walk again, he decided to channel his energy into helping others  with the disease. He devoted two years to visiting cancer patients before determining  that  he should establish his own support organization, which he named the Community Cancer  Support Group.  The group is a valuable resource consisting  of a team of people who reach out to offer  support, encouragement, and hope to cancer  patients.  The Community Cancer Support  Group holds monthly meetings and brings in  guest speakers that address the educational,  psychological, spiritual, and medical needs of  its members.  Mr. Strydio grew up in Bayonne and was an  outstanding high school football and baseball  player. At one time a catching prospect for the  Brooklyn Dodgers, Mr. Strydio  shifted  his  focus in 1970 to teaching Okinawa-style martial arts called Isshin Ryu. After more than 30  years, he is still teaching at St. Peter’s College  in Jersey City.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Mr. Strydio, a champion in many respects, for his courageous battle with cancer  and his establishment of the Community Cancer Support Group.  f  HONORING  CONGRESSMAN  AMO  HOUGHTON AND CONGRESSMAN  JACK QUINN  SPEECHOF  HON.

It has been a  true  honor to work with them. They will be greatly  missed.  While we did not share the same political  party, that fact never prevented us from working  together  to  improve Upstate New York.  These  two men  had  very  different  backgrounds: JACKQUINNwas a union steelworker  and  teacher  before  entering  politics; AMO  HOUGHTONwas head of Corning Glass Works.  Yet,  they are good  friends who have  represented the working families in their districts  well and with grace.  In 2002, when a State redistricting plan proposed to match these two men against each  other, I think their statements at the time reflect their character and friendship:  ‘‘In my heart, I don’t want to knock out Jack  Quinn,’’ HOUGHTON said.  ‘‘He’s an extraordinary guy.’’  ‘‘I hope  it  is not against my good  friend,  Amo Houghton,’’ QUINN said. ‘‘If it is, I’ll just  invite him  to dinner, maybe  take our wives,  and talk about what is best for the people of  western New York.’’  Through  their committee posts, both moderate Members fought for the interests of New  York State.  As  the  former chairman of a Fortune 500  company, AMOHOUGHTONunderstood how the  Federal Government could play a role in sustaining and creating  local businesses. As a  senior member  on  the House Ways  and  Means Committee, Representative HOUGHTON  partnered with me to help create and maintain  the wool duty relief program, which is credited  with stemming the loss of manufacturing jobs  in  the suit  industry. Duty relief on  imported  wool suiting fabrics has proven critical to the  survival of Hickey-Freeman, a high-end suit  manufacturer that has long operated in Rochester.  I was privileged to work closely with Representative QUINNafter the redistricting process in 2002 when we came to share the city  of Buffalo. JACKwent out of his way to introduce me to the area and its people. He is truly  the ‘‘Big Man from Buffalo.’’ As one example  of his effort to improve the local economy, we  cohosted a widely attended forum with local  manufacturers to discuss what action the Federal Government must  take  to ensure  that  western New York and the rest of the United  States will remain competitive in the manufacturing sector.  I will miss  the partnership  I enjoyed with  both men, and their decency and respect for  this institution. I have heard it said that legislation  is  the art of compromise, and both of  these men understood that principle. We need  more people with the ability to reach across  the aisle.  I know that this is not the last we will hear  from either of them. Both of them still have  much to contribute to public discourse and Upstate New York.  I wish both of  them  the best of  luck and  continued success in their future endeavors.  HONORING  CONGRESSMAN  AMO  HOUGHTON AND CONGRESSMAN  JACK QUINN  SPEECHOF  HON. VITO FOSSELLA  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 19, 2004  ",2004
1841,212,2004-12-07,Mr. FOSSELLA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and pay tribute to my distinguished colleague from the State of New York, Congressman AMOHOUGHTON. He is retiring after 18  years of esteemed public service as the Congressional Representative of  the citizens of  the 29th District of New York. Prior to his service  in  the U.S. Congress, Representative  HOUGHTONwas an established and well respected businessman. A former CEO of a Fortune 500 company, Mr. HOUGHTONwas able  to bring those skills to Washington to the benefit of  the  legislative process. His ability  to  work with both sides of the aisle made him an  effective and powerful legislator. Known as a  moderate Republican and fiscal conservative,  Congressman HOUGHTONactively worked with  a coalition of moderate Republicans to pursue  meaningful budget reforms. Additionally, history will record Mr. HOUGHTONas one of the  early leaders driving reform of the Alternative  Minimum Tax. On behalf of the residents of  the State of New York, I would like to thank  Representative HOUGHTON for his exceptional  service in the U.S. Congress. It has been a  pleasure to serve with him, and his presence  among the New York delegation will be sorely  missed. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity to congratulate Mr. HOUGHTONon  a job well done, and wish him the very best  in the years ahead.  f  REMOVE  WELDON  REFUSAL  CLAUSE FROM OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL  HON.

1842,212,2004-12-07,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker,  last month,  the Republican majority pushed through Congress a $388 billion omnibus spending bill that  very few people had a chance to read.  The Weldon provision was slipped into this  enormous bill which severely alters the state  of reproductive healthcare  in  this country.  It  gags America’s doctor’s and  it  jeopardize’s  women’s health.  Without education and without knowledge  and  information, women are being  forced  to  make  life-changing decisions about  their reproductive health.  This  is not only wrong,  it’s un-American.  The Weldon provision is nothing but another  attack on a woman’s right to choose in an effort to dismantle Roe v. Wade.

1843,219,2004-12-07,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the Ironbound Community Corporation, a multiservice organization that has made  amazing contributions to the city and residents  of Newark. The  Ironbound Community Corporation celebrated  its 35th anniversary on  October 22, 2004, at the Mediterranean Manor  in Newark, NJ.  Guided by a desire  to ensure  justice and  equality for all people, the Ironbound Community Organization provides a variety of programs and outreach services and offers assistance in areas such as family literacy, multilingual adult education, family assistance and  development, and senior citizen care. In addition, it develops programs for children, adolescents, environmental projects, and general  neighborhood issues, with the goal of improving the lives of those living in and around the  ethnically  and  culturally  diverse  Ironbound  neighborhood. More than 700 people benefit  daily from the services this wonderful organization provides.  Each year, the Community Corporation honors those who have contributed greatly to the  organization’s success. This year’s honorees  include Gabriella Morris, Joseph DiVincenzo,  Anto´nio  Matinho,  David  and  Florence  Schnegelberger, Bernadine Fillmore, and Eva  Harris.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the Ironbound Community Corporation for 35 years of dedicated and honorable  service working  to  improve  the  lives of  the  people of Newark.  Its broad  range of programs and services has greatly impacted the  community and will no doubt continue to benefit the lives of countless people in the years  to come.  f  RELEASE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  RECIPIENT AUNG SAN SUU KYI  HON. MIKE PENCE  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 7, 2004  ",2004
1844,219,2004-12-07,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  highlight recent and profoundly heartbreaking  situations  in  the brutal authoritarian dictatorship of Burma. For nearly two decades, the  ruling military regime has sought to crush any  and all opposition to their complete domination  of the country.  The military junta’s actions have led to the  unjust imprisonment of over 1,000 political opponents, including the world’s only imprisoned  Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San Suu  Kyi. While indications recently hinted at the release of most, if not all, of these political prisoners, once again the regime has proven that  no  trust can be  lent  to  their promises. Just  days after the promising release of a handful  of democracy activists,  the military  junta  informed Aung San Suu Kyi that her sentence  would be extended one more year.  Mr. Speaker, even more appalling, recent  reports indicate that five Burma Army battalions are involved in slash and burn campaigns  in ethnic minority controlled areas in eastern  Burma. These actions follow an all-too-familiar  pattern of tactics employed by the regime to  stifle resistance by anti-regime, ethnic minorities. Military are actively burning villages and  crucial rice supplies. Perhaps a greater outrage is the military then land mining the empty  villages, and most  times,  the paths  to and  from that village so people are unable to return. There is no other intention in these actions than extermination.  As a strong advocate for children, I am saddened that the nearly 7,500 displaced villagers  recently fleeing to the jungle include numerous  children. The child mortality and malnutrition  among these displaced people are staggering.  Not only the children are suffering the effects  of  this displacement. With nowhere  to go,  many  families are divided and many people  die of preventable, treatable diseases.  Mr. Speaker, I add my voice to others in this  great nation  that continue  to seek  freedom  and democracy  for  the people of Burma.  I  strongly object to the continued imprisonment  of Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu  Kyi, and call for her immediate release. I also  encourage the Administration to take whatever  measures necessary  to exert more pressure  on the ruling military regime.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4818,  CONSOLIDATED  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005  SPEECHOF  HON. ED WHITFIELD  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, November 20, 2004  ",2004
1845,219,2004-12-07,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong opposition to a provision inserted in the  FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Title 1  section 142 states  ‘‘Any excess animal sold  under this provision shall no longer be considered to be a wild-free roaming horse or burro  for purposes of this Act.’’ This section completely  reverses  the goal of  the Wild Free-  Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,  which was aimed at stopping wild horses and  burros  from being harvested  for commercial  poses without limitation.  The Bureau of Land Management, BLM,  oversees  approximately  261 million  acres.  More than 29 million acres of this land is used  for wild horse and burro grazing. BLM’s responsibilities with  regard  to caring  for wild  horses and burros were created by the Wild  Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971.  Although the act’s primary concern is caring  for wild horses and burros, it also permits BLM  to lease this land for several purposes, such  as grazing, mining, and parks. The act and  subsequent regulations require BLM to manage wild horses and burros on public  lands  and protect them from unauthorized capture,  branding, harassment, death, and ensure their  humane care.  Current law prohibits the sale of wild horses  and burros  for processing  into commercial  products. Section 142 will undermine these efforts by allowing wild horses and burros that  are at least 10 years old or have been put up  for adoption three times to be auctioned. As a  cosponsor of the American Horse Protection  Act, along with 227 other Members, I am appalled that wild horses and burros could possibly be captured for slaughter.  Horses that are sent to slaughter are often  crammed  into double decker  trailers, where  conditions are so bad that many horses arrive  at the slaughtering facility injured. Moreover,  since  there are no export  tariffs on horse  meat, no profits from this industry remain in  America. The profits go directly  to Belgium  and France, which is where the owners of the  only slaughter houses  in  the United States  live. More importantly, the provision is a devastating blow to the equine industry, because  they have worked diligently to protect horses  from slaughter.  Section 142 was inserted during conference  negotiations, leaving many members unaware  of the new provision and its impact. In addition, no stand-alone legislation has been introduced and, to my knowledge, the House Resources Committee had not seen  this  language. Because  this provision was  inserted  behind closed doors, no congressional authorizing committee had an opportunity  to comment on this provision and its impact. Additionally, no hearings have been held  to get  feedback from BLM on possible alternatives.  In fact, since 1988, every Department of Interior Appropriations bill has included language  that states, ‘‘Appropriations herein made shall  not be available for the destruction of healthy,  unadopted, wild horses and burros in the care  of the Bureau or its contractor.’’ Coincidently,  this language was left out this year. I believe  that if this language was brought before the  full House for a vote as stand-alone legislation  it would  fail, because clearly  the majority of  the House has gone on record opposing the  slaughter of horses.  Mr. Speaker, it does not speak well of this  institution when  individual members of  the  House and Senate can change 16 .years of  policy by sneaking a provision into the Omnibus without disclosure, discussion, or public  knowledge. Horses are part of our American  heritage and hold a favored status. They are  not  food animals  in  this country and, unlike  cows, pigs, and chickens, they should not be  bred, raised, or gathered for slaughter.  f  THE CURSE HAS STRUCK OUT  HON. EDWARD J.

1846,219,2004-12-07,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, in celebration of  the victory of the Red Sox in the World Series,  I have an offering for the House, with apologies to Ernest L. Thayer entitled, ‘‘The Curse  Has Struck Out.’’  The outlook wasn’t guaranteed for the Red  Sox nine this year  Since 1918 our boys had left us crying in our  beer.  And when they lost twice in New York, and  then at home again  A pall-like silence fell over the loyal Red  Sox fans.  A straggling few got up to go in deep despair.  ‘‘Wait ’til next year,’’ they said. Resignation  filled the air.  The rest clung to that hope that springs  eternal in the human breast.  ‘‘It ain’t over ’til it’s over’’ they muttered  half in jest.

1847,226,2004-12-07,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant  support of  the  conference  report on H.R.  4818,  the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations  bill. Though  there are many  important and  laudable provisions contained in this spending  bill, I am troubled by other specific provisions  and by the process that this bill has followed.  I am pleased  that  the bill provides an  increase  in  funding  for national security and  counterintelligence operations at  the Federal  Bureau of  Investigation. Unfortunately,  this  Congress has failed in its effort to pass comprehensive  intelligence  reform  legislation,  which would ensure that this money is being  spent appropriately and that the efforts of our  agencies are coordinated.  I am pleased to see that this conference report provides $1.3 billion for Education Impact  Aid, $24 million more than last year. This program provides  funding  for military  impacted  schools  such  as  those  in  the  towns  of  Eatontown and Tinton Falls. I am also pleased  that the bill includes $250 million for the community college initiative, which will fund workforce development partnerships between community colleges and employers.  Despite  these provisions, we have more  work to do to fully fund what should be a top  priority for this Congress—education. One day  after we passed the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA,  we underfunded aid to schools by $1.7 billion.  Considering  the  rising cost of higher education, I am disappointed that the bill does not  increase the maximum Pell Grant Award. We  cannot keep the maximum Pell grant award at  $4,050 and expect families to be able to afford  college.  I am deeply troubled that this bill includes  such a restrictive  limitation on  funding  for a  woman’s  constitutionally  protected  right  of  choice. Specifically,  this bill prohibits use of  funds to pay for health benefits coverage that  includes coverage of abortion. It also protects  health care providers who refuse  to provide  this needed service. Such measures are designed to limit women’s rights, and have no  business in this bill.  I am disappointed that the Community Oriented Policing Service, COPS, program has  been cut by $142 million. Many of the towns  in my district have received funding for police  officers through this program, which has made  our communities safer.  It simply makes no  sense to be taking cops off the street at a time  when they are more needed than ever.  I am also  troubled  that  this spending bill  cuts the budget for the National Science Foundation, NSF, by $62 million from last year’s inadequate appropriation. The work of the NSF  provides the basic scientific underpinnings for  the most advanced technological research and  development in the world. We cannot hope to  remain  the world’s most  scientifically  advanced nation if we continue to shortchange  our researchers.  I am disturbed by the economic situation in  which we find ourselves. Congress was forced  to increase its debt limit by $800 billion—and  that is on top of debt increases of $450 billion  in 2002 and another $984 billion in 2003. The  increase in the debt ceiling in just the past 3  years is almost 2.5 times the entire Federal  debt accumulated between 1776 and 1980.  We are  in  this situation because of  the  choices of the President and the Republican  majority. They chose to prioritize tax cuts for  the wealthy, rather than adequately maintaining balanced budgets and protecting the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. They  chose to engage in a costly, dangerous, and  unnecessary war  in  Iraq, which has sapped  our ability to combat al Qaeda and fund important domestic priorities. They chose to bundle  funds for 13 Government departments rather  than engaging in a robust debate justifying the  policies and priorities that we are asking the  American people to pay for.  Perhaps most disturbing about  this appropriations bill is the process that it has followed.  The  infamous  provision  allowing  unprecedented authority for Members of Congress and  staff to access the private tax returns of individuals and businesses demonstrates that our  budget process is broken. This provision was  slipped into a 3,000 page bill which Members  had no time to read before voting. The process has become corrupted by the Republican  majority, which has evidently decided that enacting pet projects and controversial items that  cannot pass on their own merit, are more important  than debate, compromise, and good  governance.  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill because it  will allow  the  important work of  the Federal  Government to continue. However, I hope that  next year’s appropriations process reflects a  greater commitment to funding important priorities and following a fair and thorough legislative process.  f  CONGRATULATING DOBBS FERRY  HIGH SCHOOL  HON.

1848,226,2004-12-07,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Dobbs Ferry High School for winning the 2004 New York State Class C Football Championship.  Through hard work, commitment and by always keeping their eye on the ball, this team  completed a perfect 13–0 season en route to  the title.  This championship continues the rich tradition that Dobbs Ferry High School has established on and off the football field. By winning  this title, Dobbs Ferry has now won the state  title two of the last three years. Dobbs Ferry  is only the fifth school ever to win a state title  in multiple football classes.  By applying the principles of fair play, good  sportsmanship and constructive competition to  sports and all other walks of life, the school  has become a shining example for others to  follow.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring Dobbs Ferry High School on their  accomplishment, and I wish them the best of  luck in defending their title next season.  A TRIBUTE TO PHYLLIS SHERARD  HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 7, 2004  ",2004
1849,226,2004-12-07,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of  Phyllis Sherard for her dedication to educating  our youth and strengthening our community.  One of the best kept secrets about Phyllis is  that she was actually born in Norfolk, Virginia,  arriving in New York via North Carolina at the  age of  four.  In spite of  this, she boastfully  claims to be an authentic product of Brooklyn,  having resided  in  this wonderful borough of  New York all of her life.  As the eldest of six siblings, her parents instilled values and traits in her that have become her trademarks. Many people describe  her as a born leader who is capable, responsible, compassionate, dependable, and motivational. No matter how high or wide the obstacles, Phyllis’ attitude  is always,  ‘‘We can  handle it!’’  In 1985, Phyllis  joined  the NYC Board of  Education. She always wanted  to  teach but  was encouraged to pursue commercial studies  while in high school. However, through her experiences, she realized how important it is to  get involved in the education of our children.  Following the path that she now says was her  destiny, she joined the staff of Project 17—the  Drug Prevention Education Program in Community School District 17.  Initially, she had  second  thoughts about  the position because  she had to take a cut in pay. That was 20  years ago and needless to say, it has been  the most fulfilling work of her life. The position  opened doors  for Phyllis  to work with  thousands of children, directing,  intervening, and  changing paths for so many children and their  parents. Because of her ability and commitment, she was selected to serve as the Special Assistant to the Superintendent for Parent  Involvement.  Phyllis is most proud of implementing The  First Clergy Conference, a series of Saturday  African American Studies for parents, The Cultural Awareness Summer Program  for children, the Christmas Toy Drive, Family Literacy  Program, Computer Literacy for Parents, youth  conferences, and a general equivalency program for young mothers, as well as working  with parents  to  coordinate  the  first math,  science, & technology parent conference. She  currently directs drug prevention education  programs for Region Six, which is comprised  of 109 schools. This has been the most challenging experience for her. She has also implemented an evening counseling program for  at-risk students and their families.  Phyllis is a graduate of Long Island University, where she earned a B.A.  in Political  Science and a Masters degree in Supervision  and Administration. She is the proud mother of  Darryn and Jade-Lynn and the proud grandmother of grandson, Darryn Scott.  Mr. Speaker, Phyllis Sherard has been instrumental  in strengthening  the educational  experience for children in our community. As  such, she is more than worthy of receiving our  recognition today, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in honoring this truly remarkable person.

Bill grew up on  the east coast and graduated from Princeton University with an engineering degree before coming West to attend  the Business School at Stanford University.  After graduation, Bill and his wife Christy settled  in Palo Alto because of  the city’s outstanding public school system, and Bill began  in the real estate business.  Fate  intervened and  the Neidig’s enrolled  their daughter Stephanie in the kindergarten at  St. Joseph’s. Bill says that growing up he had  never really known a nun. But after meeting  the Religious of the Sacred Heart he came to  appreciate  the well educated women who  have devoted  themselves  to educating his  children, and he was sold on the school and  wanted to help out.  Bill joined the Building and Grounds Committee in 1990 and joined the board of trustees in 1991, where he has continued to serve  ever since, except for a mandatory one year  sabbatical.  In  this capacity, Bill worked diligently  to maintain and upgrade  the  facilities  and grounds at Sacred Heart. He has been involved in upgrading St. Joseph’s classrooms,  offices,  and  science  lab.  He  developed  Spieker  Pavilion,  the Main  Building,  the  Aquatics Center,  the West Wing and  the  library, the football field, the track and tennis facilities, and most recently the Performing Arts  Center. At no other time in the history of Sacred Heart Schools Atherton has so much  been accomplished in such a short time period.  Bill has also served on the Finance Committee, where his familiar cry, ‘‘Less is more,  but will it do everything you need?’’ has been  a guiding principle in the financial decisions of  the school.  Bill knows how  to ask  the right questions  and get the right answers. Whenever something needs to be done, he can be counted on  to make sure it gets done. He has been extraordinarily giving of his time and talent, and  his support for Sacred Heart Schools is an inspiration to all.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in honoring this great and inspiring man, William Neidig, as he  is honored with  the St.  Madeleine Sophie Medal.  f  RECOGNIZING CHRISTOPHER  EARLEY  HON.

This year Christopher completed a distinguished career as a wrestler at Chillicothe  High School, under  the  tutelage of coaches  Dave Kinnen and Ken Stull. Christopher was  named  to  the All District Wrestling Team  in  2003, and a State Wrestling Qualifier in 2003  and 2004. During his senior season Christopher enjoyed a great deal of success, as he  won  the Coach’s Award, was named  to  the  Midland Empire All-Conference, and won the  District Wrestling Championship. Christopher  was also a  four-year  letterman  in wrestling.  His academic achievements are equally  impressive, as he was the recipient of four consecutive academic  letters at Chillicothe High  School as well.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  congratulating Christopher Earley and wishing  him continued success. Christopher is a great  role model  for student-athletes  in our state,  and  I am proud  to serve him  in  the United  States Congress.  f  IN HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF  PETER V. KILBANE  HON.

Kilbane—  United States Veteran of WWII, thirty-six year  member of the Cleveland Police Department;  and most significantly, devoted  family man;  and friend and mentor to many.  Mr. Kilbane’s  life centered around his unwavering commitment to his family, to community, and to our nation. He embraced his Irish  heritage, and embraced the values, traditions  and ethics taught to him by his parents, Mihal  Moor and Honora Joyce. Together, Peter and  his beloved wife of sixty-two years, Margaret  Mary, offered these vital life lessons to their  children: Karen, Grace Ann, Peter G., Peggy,  and Mary. He will also be remembered as a  loving father figure to Mary Lou Wallish, and  to the memory of Harry Spencer.  Mr. Kilbane served our country with honor  and courage. His decorated service during  WWII reflected his heroic actions  in France,  Belgium, Holland and Germany, including the  Battle of the Bulge. From the front lines fighting for liberty during the war, to the front lines  fighting crime along the streets of Cleveland,  Mr. Kilbane exhibited  the  same unyielding  dedication and concern for others. He worked  in every district within  the Cleveland Police  Department, and held the position of Lieutenant of Special Operations, Detective Bureau,  when he retired in 1987. Beyond his professional commitments, Mr. Kilbane consistently  reached out  into our  community. He held  board positions and was an active member of  many civic organizations, including St. Malachi  Parish, the Holy Name Society, the Fraternal  Order of Police, the Emerald Society, and the  Retired Irish Police Society. In 2000, the Retired Irish Police Society named him the Retired Irish Police Officer of the Year.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor, gratitude and remembrance of Mr.  Peter V. Kilbane—a man of heart, courage  and integrity, who lived life with a joyous focus  on family, friends and helping others. I extend  my deepest condolences to his beloved wife,  Margaret Mary, to his children, grandchildren,  great-children  and  to  his  extended  family  members and many  friends. His kindness,  heart and courageous service has served to  uplift our Cleveland community, and his shining legacy, spirit and memory will live on forever within the minds and hearts of all whom  knew and loved him well.  f  IN HONOR OF ADM SAMUEL LEE  GRAVELY  HON.

Admiral Gravely was born in Richmond, Virginia on June 4, 1922. After attending Virginia  Union University for 2 years, he enlisted in the  Navy Reserve in 1942 and was trained as a  fireman apprentice.  In 1943, he participated in a Navy program  known as V–12, which was designed to select  and  train highly qualified men  for commissioning as officers in the Navy. As part of his  V–12  training, he attended  the University of  California in Los Angeles and the Midshipmen  School at Columbia University  in New York  City.  On December 14, 1944 Admiral Gravely  successfully completed midshipman  training,  becoming the first African American commissioned as an officer from the Navy Reserve  Officers’ Training Course, ROTC.  As a newly commissioned ensign, his first  duty assignment was at a naval training station  in  Illinois, where he was assistant battalion commander for new recruits.

Aside from lung cancer, the disease kills  more men than any other form of cancer.  On November 8, 1999, Ed Rendell, one of  the country’s  foremost baseball authorities,  was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Early detection and the care of doctors like Nicholas  Romas at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City saved Ed’s life.  In late 2002, Ed founded Bat for the Cure,  a non-profit charity dedicated  to  the eradication of prostate cancer. With its prominent  Board of Directors,  including Bob Costas,  Mario Cuomo, Len Elmore, Kathy Giusti and  John Hennessy III, the charity has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight the disease.  The organization has also enlisted well-  known sports stars who are joining in the fight,  such as Dustin Baker, Frank Robinson, Tom  McCraw, Bob Watson, Don Baylor, Dave Winfield, and Rafael Palmeiro. Many of these celebrities have personal experiences with  the  tragedy of cancer.  Fortunately, prostate cancer  is one of  the  slowest growing cancers, so proper detection  and treatment can save lives. With Bat for the  Cure’s support, St. Luke’s-Roosevelt, the hospital that saved Ed Randell’s life, is now helping many other cancer patients become survivors.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to make  prostate cancer research and early detection a  national health care priority. Congress should  act without delay to double prostate cancer research  funding at  the National  Institute of  Health, fully fund the National Cancer Institute,  and save prostate cancer research at the Veterans’ Administration.  f  STATE OF THE AFRICAN  AMERICAN MALE  HON. BARBARA LEE  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 7, 2004  ",2004
1855,240,2004-12-07,Ms. LEE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the  State of  the African American Male  conference, a national  initiative of  the Congressional Black Caucus and  the Congressional  Black Caucus Foundation  to  focus our Nation’s attention on solutions to the escalating  crisis in the Black community.  This past Friday, December 3, I hosted this  national initiative in Oakland. Included were a  visit to a prison college program, free health  screenings at the conference and concurrent  solutions-focused workshops. It was attended  by nearly 400 people, more than 60 of whom  were formerly incarcerated individuals.  The focus of the Oakland conference was  on solutions for formerly incarcerated individuals and  the challenges  that prevent  them  from smoothly  re-entering our communities.  The Oakland Police Department reports  that  some 80 percent of the 114 homicides comJACKmitted in Oakland in 2003 involved people on  parole or probation. For  that  reason,  I  felt  compelled to focus the conference in my district on the steps that we as a community and  as Members of Congress can take to begin to  reverse this alarming trend.  The Oakland Conference was an important  opportunity  for us  to examine closely what  were the factors associated with the failure of  our corrections system. I wanted to look at the  needs and solutions for successful re-entry to  our communities.  On the morning before the afternoon conference, I invited my distinguished colleague  from  the Judiciary Committee, SHEILA SON-LEE, and members of  the clergy  to  join  me for a visit to San Quentin College. Offering  an Associate of Arts degree, the college program at San Quentin prison is the only on-site,  degree-granting college program in the entire  California corrections system. It is one of only  a few in the United States. It is an extension  site of Patten University in Oakland, California.  The  curriculum  at  San Quentin  includes  courses such as American Government,  literature, ethics and communication.  Without the warden and without other prison  officials present, we spent nearly an hour listening carefully to five prisoners who are serving sentences of various lengths. These gentlemen described the rewards of getting a college education while serving their sentences.  Even a prisoner serving a  life sentence described the positive influence it has had on his  life and that he encourages other prisoners to  get an education. Another prisoner  told us  how his bond with his school-age daughter  was strengthened by their sharing each other’s homework. He talked of the pride he felt  at being able to help her with her math for the  first time. Yet, these prisoners reported that it  is often difficult to maintain the motivation to  make major life changes when it takes nearly  two weeks for them to receive their mail from  loved ones, and costs  them $15  for a  ten-  minute telephone call.  When family and community ties are so essential to a successful transition, then why do  we permit such barriers to be erected between  prisoners and the people who care most about  them?  The difficulties these prisoners face during  the re-entry process are  further exacerbated  by the fact that since 1994, Pell grants have  been denied to individuals who are incarcerated. Why do we permit such barriers to remain when it is clear that education and job  training are essential to a successful transition  to our communities?  These  funding cuts are part of a broader  trend that began in 1977, when the California  Department of Corrections eliminated rehabilitation from its mission and since then its mission has been solely to punish. When I was in  the California Assembly, my colleagues and I  attempted to correct this, but were prevented  by a prevailing, but  ill-informed  ‘‘tough on  crime’’ ideology. It is outrageous and immoral  and in my district in the City of Oakland, we  saw  the consequences  in 2003  in  the 114  homicides.  Cost benefit analyses demonstrating  the  value of college over prisons are well known  and well documented. When  it  is clear  that  college is better than prison, why do we continue to incarcerate more black males than we  educate?  At the Oakland conference, education was  just one area of the re-entry process that we  examined. In addition, health screenings were  provided in the areas of HIV, prostate cancer,  hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol, and all  tests were free and open to the public. Provided by National Black Nurses Association,  Kaiser Permanente, the Ethnic Health Institute  and  California  Prevention  and  Education  Project  this component of  the program addressed basic health concerns of Black men.  Congressman DANNYDAVIS, who began the  State of the African American Male initiative,  joined Congresswoman JACKSON-LEEand me  for  the Conference. Solutions Conferences  have been held around the United States in  order to create a clearinghouse of best practices. In the Oakland Conference in my district, Topics for the concurrent Solutions Workshops  included: Re-Entry Programs; Record  Expungement; Sentencing Alternatives; Employment and Training; Health; Housing; Education; and Funding Sources. When the workshop moderators reported out their solutions, it  was abundantly clear  that  the expertise and  assistance and innovative programs exist.  Mr. Speaker, I was proud to announce at  the Oakland Conference  that one Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Scholarship  per year in my district will be designated for a  formerly incarcerated person. I was also proud  to announce that a second event will be held  on Saturday, January 22, 2005 where  I will  bring together 60 attorneys from the Charles  Houston Bar Association and  the San Francisco  Bar  Association  to  provide  record  expungement assistance to formerly incarcerated individuals. This will be an opportunity for  several hundred people to get a clean slate.  What  is needed, Mr. Speaker  is  for such  programs to become a national priority.  Rather than setting up people in the correction system  for  failure by offering  them  little  means of turning their lives around, we must  restore Pell grants to incarcerated individuals.  One of  the programs  in Oakland—Project  Choice—provides  support  services  to prisoners before they get out and stays with them.  But Project Choice only has funding to support  40 of the 3,000 people paroled each year to  Oakland.  Without programs like San Quentin College,  Project Choice and others, without the support  of their families and communities, these prisoners will return to the life that led them to  prison in the first place. As a nation, we must  provide alternatives. This is not only a matter  of public safety, but is truly our moral responsibility. It is our obligation as members of the  human race.  f  HONORING  HERITAGE  ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL  STUDENTS,  THOMPSON’S  STATION,  TENNESSEE  HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 7, 2004  ",2004
1856,240,2004-12-07,Mrs.  BLACKBURN.," Mr.  Speaker,  Tennessee is known as the ‘‘Volunteer State’’ because we have a proud tradition of giving back  to our community and our country. Today the  students at Heritage Elementary School  in  Thompson’s Station, Tennessee are reaffirming our state’s reputation for volunteerism by  working to support America’s military families.

1857,5,2004-12-20,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, on  December 15, 2004, my office released a  white paper entitled ‘‘Data Dearth in  Offshore  Outsourcing:  Policymaking  Requires Facts.’’ This white paper is  closely  linked  to  a  previous white  paper entitled  ‘‘Offshore Outsourcing  and America’s Competitive Edge: Losing Out in the High Technology R&D  and Services Sectors.’’ The latter was  released by my office in May 2004. A  summary of that report appeared  in  the RECORDon May 21, 2004.  A key conclusion of the May paper  was the absence of reliable data to  measure  and  assess  the  offshore  outsourcing phenomenon. We do not  have good data on the offshoring problem, and the data we have are general  in nature. Estimates vary widely on  the number of jobs moving overseas,  and the lack of reliable data contributes to incorrect conclusions about the  impacts of offshore outsourcing, which  can result in flawed policy responses.  We need data to understand what we  are facing so we can chart a sure and  steady course for the future. There is  enough anecdotal data about job losses  to spark debate and, in some cases, result in policies which may provide a  short-term  fix  but  which  do  not  produce longer term solutions to preserve U.S. innovation and ensure U.S.  competitiveness.  Comprehensive  and  balanced data on both job gains and job  losses  resulting  from  offshore  outsourcing are essential. This data  must be assembled by U.S. Federal  Government  agencies,  including  the  Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor, where data-gathering capabilities are extensive and research methodologies are transparent.  The lack of data is critical because  the  issues raised  in the May white  paper are  so  important. The white  paper was designed to stimulate a deeper review of the long-term implications  for our policy responses and to change  the terms of the debate on offshore  outsourcing. The paper looked at rising  global competition and the challenges  posed to America’s competitive advantage. Globalization is our current and  future reality; there is no escaping it.  The  U.S.  economy  is  inextricably  linked to the rest of the world; our fortunes rise and fall depending on our  performance with our trading partners  and our competitors. Our strength and  success with China, India, and other  emerging markets is as important to  future U.S. economic and national security as the competition with Japan  and Europe was to U.S. growth over the  last 50 years. The offshore outsourcing  phenomenon is one of the challenging  manifestations of globalization.  The May white paper found that it  was not just manufacturing jobs that  are  subject  to  global  outsourcing— where 2.7 million jobs have disappeared  since 2000—but service sector and highend R&D jobs are also being hit by offshore outsourcing. And it is not just  call centers, data entry facilities, and  other entry-level service jobs that are  impacted  by  offshore  outsourcing.  Higher skill professional jobs—from engineering,  computer  chip  design  to  nanotechnology R&D—are beginning to  go overseas, and with these jobs, we  may be losing key parts of the talent  and technology which fueled the record  growth and prosperity of  the  1990s.  Fundamental changes are facing us, as  key components of our innovation infrastructure—knowledge,  capital,  labor,  technology and  facilities—are  increasingly  mobile.  Offshore  outsourcing of labor, capital, and technology not only hurts workers but  threatens our knowledge-based economy. If engineering, design, R&D, and  services follow manufacturing abroad,  U.S. competitiveness is weakened, and  our economic prosperity and national  security are threatened.  What is at stake is the ability of the  United States to remain a global leader  in innovation, to maintain good-paying  jobs, and to expand our global market  share. We must  rethink  long-term  strategies on competitiveness, innovation, R&D, trade policy, and enforcement, as well as education and investments in human capital. However, we  cannot begin to develop effective solutions until we have an understanding  of the scope of the offshore outsourcing  phenomenon. The need for data on offshore outsourcing is paramount.  Lord Kelvin, the 19th century Belfast-born physicist said: When you  can measure what you are  speaking about and express it in numbers,  you know something about it; but when you  cannot measure it, when you cannot express  it in numbers, your knowledge is of the meager and unsatisfactory kind. That was in a May 3, 1883 lecture to  the Institute of Civil Engineers.  By improving U.S. Government data  collection, we  can  ensure  that our  knowledge of offshore outsourcing  is  neither meager nor unsatisfactory, but  informed and balanced. With improved  data and analysis, we will build constructive and lasting solutions to address the challenges posed by offshore  outsourcing.  I would like to thank Sara E. Hagigh  of my staff and Mary Jane Bolle of the  Congressional Research  Service  for  their hard work in researching and preparing this report.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have excerpts from the white  paper printed  in  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  The material follows: EXCERPT1, SUMMARYOFWHITEPAPER  The issue of offshore outsourcing has been  at the center of many key political and public debates over the last few years. The term  ‘‘outsourcing’’ has become part of our everyday lexicon, gracing the covers of news magazines, television broadcasts, and playing a  central role in Congressional debates during  an election year. Most Americans are aware  of the issue of offshore outsourcing, but few  of us have an understanding of the full dimensions of the problem.  To develop a better understanding of offshore outsourcing, my office released a white  paper  in May  2004  entitled  ‘‘Offshore  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1858,19,2004-12-20,Mr. HOEKSTRA.," Mr. Speaker, as chairman  of the conference on the bill I would also like  to briefly discuss the interpretation of this legislation.  The conference report embodies  the substantial agreement between  the House bill,  H.R. 10, and the Senate bill, S. 2845, on the  core reforms to be carried out by this legislation. It is also important to note, however, that  HYDE the conference faced many challenges in reconciling often fundamentally different philosophies and visions underlying  those  reforms  and  the specific provisions  in each bill. Accordingly, the conferees agreed to submit only  a very limited Joint Explanatory Statement on  the conference report, relying on the text of  the legislation to represent our agreements.  Only that text, which is controlling, and the  Joint Explanatory Statement were agreed  to  by both houses and reflect the intent of the  conferees. I should also note that Chairman  intends  to submit a statement  for  the  record reflecting bipartisan and bicameral understandings with respect to certain foreign affairs provisions of the bill. Other statements by  Members of Congress outside  the scope of  the Joint Explanatory Statement, media  reports, or the reports or work product of any of  the outside panels or  commissions whose  work contributed to this legislation reflect their  own views and should not be construed as determinative guidance with respect to legislative  intent.  While that framework ultimately controls interpretation of the bill, I would like to note my  understanding as chairman of the conference  of several matters within this legislation.  AUTHORITIESOFTHEDIRECTOROFNATIONAL  INTELLIGENCE  The nature of the authorities to be granted  to  the Director of National  Intelligence, DNI,  and  the relationship of  the Director  to other  Federal officials were delicate and precisely  negotiated  issues, with resulting agreements  reflected in the legislative language of the conference report. Only that legislative language  controls the authorities of the DNI.  This principle bears special emphasis in a  number of areas. With respect to budget formulation, the text of the agreement carefully  and explicitly specifies  the authorities of  the  DNI and  the relationships between  the DNI,  the heads of individual agencies and organizations within the National Intelligence Program,  and the heads of executive departments containing  those  agencies  and  organizations.  Those  roles and authorities should be construed solely by reference to the provisions of  the conference  report and existing  law—no  more, and no less.  For example, the text explicitly provides that  both the heads of executive departments containing agencies or organizations within the intelligence community and the heads of those  discrete agencies may each provide annual  budget proposals  to  the DNI, based on  the  DNI’s guidance, for the DNI to use in determining and presenting an intelligence budget  to  the President. Beyond  this direction,  the  legislation does not specify how  the budget  proposals are  to be developed or provided,  and it is properly for the executive branch to  determine how  to execute  the statute consistent with its text.  Similarly, the legislation provides, in amended section 102A(e)(2)(A) of the National Security Act,  that personnel  transfers are  to be  made  in accordance with procedures developed by the DNI and the heads of affected departments and agencies.  It does not specify  what role is to be played in the transfers by  department and agency heads pursuant  to  such procedures. Presumably, that matter will  be determined by the executive branch within  the  agreement  on  procedures  developed  under the legislative text.  Consistent with basic  constitutional principles, the legislation provides that the DNI’s  authority  is  ‘‘[s]ubject  to  the authority, direction, and control of  the President.’’ Accordingly, the text does not specify who is to perform the President’s daily intelligence briefing  or  under  what  specific  operational  circumstances the President will interact with the  Director of the CIA, which should be matters  for the President to decide himself.  The legislation also contains a detailed provision dealing with the apportionment of funds.  That provision textually speaks only to the apportionment of  funds, not  to apportionment  plans or any other related matter. Similarly,  the conference report does not specifically authorize the creation of an entity within the Office of the DNI to perform common services or  of a Chief Financial Officer for the DNI. Nor  does  it provide  that an open source  intelligence center,  if created, should be a new  element of the intelligence community. Nor is  the conforming amendment to section 105(a)  of the National Security Act contained in section 1072(a)(2) of  the  legislation  intended  to  substantively amend the authority of the Secretary of Defense. That provision merely clarifies that section 105(a) of the National Security Act should be construed  in conjunction  with the specified statutory authorities of the  DNI. Had the conference intended to address  any of these matters in this legislation, appropriately specific provisions would have been  included to do so.  NATIONALCOUNTERTERRORISMCENTERANDNATIONAL  INTELLIGENCECENTERS  The authorities of the National Counterterrorism Center were issues of great and delicate debate during  the conference. This  is  particularly  true with respect  to  the balance  between the authority of the NCTC to conduct  ‘‘strategic operational planning’’ and  the authority of individual departments and agencies  to plan and direct the conduct of the resulting  operations. There was full agreement that the  NCTC properly should assign ‘‘roles and responsibilities’’  to  agencies  participating  in  Counterterrorism operations. However, the text  of the legislation specifies that the assignment  of ‘‘roles and responsibilities’’ does not extend  to directing the execution of any resulting operations. The legislation does not, for example, authorize the NCTC to determine which  personnel or specific capabilities should be utilized by agencies in mission execution.  Similarly, careful discussions took place in  the conference with respect  to  the detail of  personnel to the NCTC, with the outcome memorialized in the legislative text. There is no  specific  direction  to  concentrate  personnel  holding  scarce and desirable  skills  in  the  NCTC, nor is such concentration prohibited. In  exercising authorities to transfer or detail personnel,  it will be  important  for  the DNI  to  weigh the needs of an effective NCTC with the  needs of other agencies and the intelligence  community as a whole.  The conference also reached compromise  on the scope and authorities of any future National Intelligence Centers that might be created by the Director of National Intelligence.  The conference report authorizes the DNI to  establish,  if appropriate and necessary  to  complete  the mission,  national  intelligence  centers that are administratively distinct from  the other agencies of the intelligence community. However, it does not require that all National Intelligence Centers be created as separate and administratively distinct entities. As  with the NCTC, it will be important for the DNI  VerDate Aug 04 2004  02:19 Dec 21, 2004 Jkt 039060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A20DE8.023 E20PT1 ",2004
